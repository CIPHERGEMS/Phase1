Shook Ones Part II,The Infamous,1995.0,"Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
Yo I got the phone thing, know I'm sayin', keep your eyes open
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings
Keep your eyes open
No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, get laid on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'

Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know
Queens get the money",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-shook-ones-part-ii-lyrics
Survival of the Fittest,The Infamous,1995.0,"Yeah, sendin' this one out
To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?
That old real shit

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Open your eyes and get wise
Look alive, in '95, word up
Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed

Hell on Earth (Front Lines),Hell On Earth,1996.0,"Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first, Blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and gun toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound we rocked in '96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send 22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
Yo, it's right in front of your eyes

We rep the QBC, nigga rep yours, it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs
Adapt to gat sound and bow down
Slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce 20 years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind-control you, double-edge blow you
It'll be I like I'm supposed to
The clique is coastal, international, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City Godfather Pt III
Gotti, Gambino and Ty Nitty, Scarface, rest in peace!

Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes
Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
Ayo, it's right in front of your eyes

Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
POW niggas is found MIA
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89 the same way
The God P walk with a limp see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long ‘cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what Black, here's the issue
It's a package deal: you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap—I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however, it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick so save that bullshit for the birds
Live up to my word, if I got beef niggas comin' in herds
We flush through, your clique get purged",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-hell-on-earth-front-lines-lyrics
Quiet Storm,Murda Muzik,1999.0,"Done been through it all, man
Blood, sweat and tears, niggas is dead and shit
What the fuck else can happen, yo?
I don't think much more, son, word to mother, yo
We done seen it all, and been through it all, yo
Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother, for real, for real
That shit is the truth, I'm not lyin'

I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' them
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right
Fuck your life! Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'
You hooked on Mobb-phonics, Infamous-bonics
Lyin' to the Pop Dog like you got it
You ain't no wildin' out for the Knife-Fist thrower
Rusty shank holder, we live this shit

‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

Yo, the P rock forty inch cables, drinkin' white label
My chain hang down to my dick, my piece bang glass tables
Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin', even my pops too
He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy, I couldn't even look
Because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my niggaty Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little Dunns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in

‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

It go one, two, three to the fourth
That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment, give 'em that shit they been missin'
My new edition's way bitchin'
Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil

‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-quiet-storm-lyrics
"Shook Ones, Part I",The Infamous (Demo Tape),1994,"The most violent of the violentest crimes we give life to
If these Queensbridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies
Your first time will be your last Earth memories
It's only your own fault, I gave you fair warning
Beware of killer kids who don't care
Unaware fools will be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery how I form the words in rhyme
In nineteen hundred and ninety square
All shook niggas is supposed to have fear
Tryna get a piece of this pie, we don't share
Prepare for the worst 'cause I been there
Try to keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggas is forced to do dirt
And God made dirt, so this dirt won't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt
On these streets for nineteen years and not leaving
My first priority's to reach twenty one breathing
Forever beef, nobody will ever be even
So I grab the heat before breezing
Lost in this foul mind state I can't keep straight thinkin'
But I keep my eyes on the Earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front he get slugs in him
Because...

He ain't a crook son (son)
He just a shook one (shook one)
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones (shook ones)
He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one (shook one)

For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
To all my peoples in the Bridge know what I'm talking 'bout, right
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
'Cause Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for the he say she say I'm bigger than that
Claiming that you pack a gat but you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island change your ways and stop
Thirteen  years in the projects of hard times I've lived in
Wake up in the morning thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live
Or I am going to burn in hell for all the shit I did?
No time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want nigga
Lay on your back, I don't fake jacks kid
You know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid you outta line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition mission
I'm strictly sipping E&J like got my mind flippin'
I'm bugging digging my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot kid
You know my motherfucking function
'Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get on I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs I hit
Your dome up, when I roll up
Don't be caught sleeping 'cause I'm creeping
You just a shook one

He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one
We live the life that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones (shook ones)
He ain't a crook son
He just a shook one (shook one)
We live the life that of diamonds and guns

Eye for a Eye (Your Beef Is Mines),The Infamous,1995.0,"As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin' to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas try to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps, I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me

Aiyo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Tryin' to make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
'Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid
No one can stop me, try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

A drug dealer's dream:
Stash CREAM, keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like the gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em
What's up to all my niggas swerving in New York metropolis
The Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watching us
Mad man, my sanity is going like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world, we just busting

Hold up and analyze the wildcats slang cracks
They swing in Ac's, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playing corners glancing all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feeling higher than an airplane, right
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin, and Queensbridge we robbing niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale but the real we still kill

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines

Drop a Gem on ’Em,Hell On Earth,1996.0,"It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em!

Some rain got to fall, some rain got to fall
Some rain got to fall, some rain got to fall

Know what I mean? Drop a gem on 'em
Sick and tired, ugly fake crooks need to retire
They got you gassed, take a match and smack fire out ya
Maggot ass, Havoc represent for the Q-B-C
Smoke that ass like a loosie
Though I need to quit, fuck it, I love it like a cloud
Over the projects, your game I'm above it
It's combat, gats, bangers and all that
You's a small cat, whatever you on get off that
I mention, nothin' but the real shit presentin'
The hollow-tip crew, 41st side convention
Stride full, you half-steppin'
Like a fresh TEC out of the box yo, niggas I'm testin'
That's no question, bitch-ass have you confessin'
Like a DT, left in state of depression
You under pressure, in tag no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher, shooken with asthma, you casper
You yell my name, that's only givin' me props
Plus the fans that you got wonderin' what's got you hot
It's Tu-Not, knocked out the box and got rocked
Got raped on the Island, you officially got
Kick that thug shit, Vibe magazine on some love shit
Keep it real, kid, 'cause you don't know who you fuckin' with

It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em!

Drop a gem on 'em son, you know I got jewels, infamous son
Yeah, likewise I'm tired of rap guys that's faggots
Your P'll shut eyes and swole up your whole outside
I baptize, niggas get wet, hit up your backside
Get claptized and set straight, put on your head straight
Watch out for these upstate cats
Be leary of New Yiddy niggas with gats, with the wall on they back
Rikers Island flashbacks of the house you got scufted in
You would think that gettin' your head shot's enough but then
Now you wanna go at my team
Must have been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self
My rebellion, retaliate, I had the whole New York state
Aimin' at your face at the gate
Bottom line off top soon as you came through
Shots flew, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong-arm niggas ready to rock your shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chopped up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, two G's worth of stitches
To reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My mob's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
With bangers the size of African spears, it's warfare
In the arena, we turn arenas into house of horrors
It's terrordome when you see my clique
You need to run behind shit
You got a gat, you better find it
And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'
Who shot ya? You probably screamed louder than a opera
New York got ya, now you wanna use my mob as a crutch
What you think, you can't get bucked again? Once again—

-back in the house once again
Live the life that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em!
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems

Give Up the Goods (Just Step),The Infamous,1996.0,"Ayo, Queens get the Money, long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is living to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said, ""Queens niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid stay outta my way""
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
But can't stop till I'm eating off a platinum plate
Po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
'Cause having cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to have no money to live with
I thought, step back, look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helping ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up, cousin?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

Yo, it's the R-A-double-P-E-R-N-O-Y-D
Niggas can't fuck with me
Coming straight outta QB
, pushing an Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'ma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born with it, I'm getting on with it
And I'ma have it til I'm fucking dead and gone with it
'Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild muthafucker
You know my flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO
Jump out my hooptie, pass my gat and my lucci
To my shorty in case my PO try to troop me
To the 
island
, and if I start wilding
Flipping on niggas walking around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped, see
Back to Queens, pumping the fiends, making more cream
Know what I mean? 
I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4-4 and bust ya

Yo, ain't no time for faking jacks
'Cause brothers that fake jacks get laid on their backs
The streets is real, can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starving
Don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbing
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude
Off the map, 'cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealing, only mess with shorties that's appealing
I'm frontin' on the world once I start 4-wheeling
'Cause back on the 41st Side, we do it right
Sipping E&J, getting bent all night
Yo, who that? I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po-po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground
My life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself getting bodied by a clown
Ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest, now he's laying man down
Jetted up from under the benches, I started hearing sirens
I stop firing, to cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
Stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
Out the window, call my son
""Yo son, we got beef, but no question
Money had a problem so I solved him""

I got my mind on a stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinking of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Give me yours or get laid
Give up the goods or get sprayed

I got lots of love for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-of-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up
Caught up in the crossfire get theyself hurt up
While I be sipping gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
First of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothing to play with
No jokes, no games, kid
For years I been doing the same shit
Just, drinking liquor, doing bids
Extorting crack heads, and sticking up the stick-up kids",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-give-up-the-goods-just-step-lyrics
The Start of Your Ending (41st Side),The Infamous,1995.0,"You know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna say what's up to my man
Louie you know he's still here
Drop this one for you, you know
And for those who don't know
The 41st Side

I keep it real, pack steel like my man YG
When a fool try to play me wet 'em up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran, I never did
Forever wildin' that's how we live up in the Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat then hit a nigga like a bid
25, nah, kid you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife
It's the, semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique and get vic
I'm on some bullshit that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blades in pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge, kid, we on the scene, kid
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin'
Don't ever do that I run with two macs
And plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me or get sprayed with the sweeper
Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters
And big heaters
Blow you three times leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn you get scolded
Old and molded when I get bent you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt I'm stuck and I can't get out
Of this lifestyle, the 41st side get bent, run wild
The 41st side, two
You know how we do, violate, motherfucker
I'ma see you, with the Linden
It's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again

Yeah kid, its Big Time boy, 12th street representin' it
Big shout out to my man, Tear Gas, think, Lake whole crew kid
You knowhatI'msayin' couso? Richie Fraud known to leave ya scarred, give a big shoot out to my man Heavy L
Big Palms representing from the Goodfellas

Yo, it's the P. E. double push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come along only the hoes can enter
Told her to meet me at six on the hill at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Faced it, violate and get lace'd
Why you wasting slugs? You ain't buckin' nothing
You better off buckin' yourself: you need to stop fronting
I used to drive an Ac and kept a Mac in the engine
Littles painted it black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects the Infamous
Our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me, accompanied by the cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at
You must have cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass (what what, what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stomping you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Putting cowards where they're supposed to be
If I don't know your face then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they ending, my man's lendin' me his Linden Forty-two shots depending
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We busting caps non-stop, blazing
In all the shows and even at the hoes
(Nah, nah chill son)
What?

And it's the start of your ending
(word up yo, it's the start of niggas ending, youknowhatI'msayin?)
And it's the start of your motherfuckin' ending

Drink Away the Pain (Situations),The Infamous,1995.0,"Yeah, about to get my thug on
The 41st side of things

I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her no more now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold (Yeah that bitch)
Last name was English and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick it made me lazy
We split apart and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this
I bust her cherry
, took her virginity in '91 (word)
Now that she's open everybody want to tap something
Go get your own don't make me have to fucking clap something
I love my shorty more than life now ain't that something
To love you Dainy more than living itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up they tell me put her back on the shelf
They say say yo P she only wants you for one thing that's your wealth
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby
The Dainy you know she drive me crazy she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89 now she's 22 (word)
Acting like she 40, she said all I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things (word)
And Queensbridge niggas be acting like they kings
Pushin' Lexuses, wearing fat diamond rings
My cellular phone reigns supreme, international think rational
The 12th Street crew move back when we come through

I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's losing its brain
I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain (what, what)
I think the whole world's going insane
I fill my mind up with Dainy, and drink away the pain

Tommy Hil was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is coming through
, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't going out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers
Diesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's acting bolo
 trying to say he the 
Boss
I said shut the fuck up, the kid is out with the loot sack
Got a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top so you know he livin' Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face
All them other kids they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub so you know they getting laced
Donna Karan was cryin', 'cause mad shells was flyin'
Damn all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk now we up out here
Got back to the mansion, to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not, and Guess was hot, so guess what (What?)
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut

When you play with crime sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceiving to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, eyo)
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip I thought the bitch was a fucking warlock
The more she started givin' me the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more cream with the fellas
Fuck them niggas spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy
Then I thought to myself, yo this trick is right
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin' why you trickin' yo this shit must stop
Moms like you need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock dun I need that
She's my shorty for life so fuck the feedback

I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost its brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain

To all the brothers who ain't here
Pour out a little somethin' on the floors man
Time to get a little bent do our thing, word up
The 41st side Queens, bent you know what I mean
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy
Dainy take me away, Dainy take me away",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-drink-away-the-pain-situations-lyrics
Right Back at You,The Infamous,1995.0,"Now, '94 to '95, and it's all about crime
Drop that shit

Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24/7, Mac-11 is my people
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Fuck where you at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'ma test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With MACs and TECs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you
I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it locked
Rocking Convertibles, drop tops and mad hot
Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team
Who's organized, all eyeballs is on CREAM
And your whole clique got nothin' but raw shit
Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks
Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable
In the jungle, banging Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu
There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons
Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns
You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in Saran
Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand
Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender
Get ninjaed on the Island, plus the Bridge, boy remember

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shorties out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that 118 tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me
Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me

Temperature’s Rising,The Infamous,1995.0,"Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitching on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin'
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hoping to find who they looking for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get their thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin' crazy
From windows, I see lights flashing and maybe
Somebody's taking pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up a G so everybody's pointing fingers
And lying, aiyyo son, the temp is rising

The temperature's rising, no there's nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising (There's nothing surprising)

What up black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around trying to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger
Seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wondering who snitched it got me losing lots of sleep at night
You know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like that?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
But 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbing wrong niggas, looking for someone to blame
They harrassing, struggling to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy, deliver
Me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em
But still, but still, but still...

The temperature's rising, no there's nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, huh and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising (There's nothing surprising)
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising
The temperature's rising, and ain't nothing surprising

Yo... straight thugs on this side - it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites - God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit - takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will - you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress
It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me

Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine

I got the style of a stillborn child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well
(Very very) The streets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin', we don't stop the music
Keep it movin' that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin (still crawlin')
Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of - melodic, hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions
(You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music
(Don't get no realer than this!)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (what?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggas can't touch us

Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine

Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin' out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way - we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
NAStradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes
You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket

Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..

It's only right
Let me put you on to what happened, son
You ain't gonna believe this shit
Kick that shit

It's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed-Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity, we reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs didn't froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open 'cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we
Jetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me
Word Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo
What can kill you is what you don't know

OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the Bridge
You ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know
The niggas in the Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
""What's goin on?"", as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making Cheese  by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear
So yo....

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
Trife life got me thinking like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt yo
What can kill you is what you don't know",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-trife-life-lyrics
Cradle to the Grave,The Infamous,1995.0,"Forever wild from the cradle to the grave, kid, watch your back
One-time's comin' always (Yeah)
They locked me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm in to win

On the scene from the 41st side of Queens (Yeah)
We get the cream, laid up, love-love redeem
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, throughout states my name'll ring

To all my peoples locked down, comin' back to life
In the world once again though ya bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war
And even more, saw my man layin' dead on the floor
Kid, I swore that our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' cross 12th Street
Just as I approached the block
I spotted Jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot (Say word)
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to, hurry back so I could warn my man

It had me stressin' little somethin', had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas started cuttin', behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case, I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (The temperature's risin')
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

Kid, you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap
Police buckin' at me, they try to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reached behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Locked the door, police grabbed me up and tried to break my jaw
Said, ""Where's the gun we saw? (I don't know)
We know you was there at the homicide scene
(I don't know nothin')
And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team""

From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(From the cradle to the grave)
From the cradle to the grave
(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave)

Yo, it's the real drama kills, nobody move, stand still
Body you, drop that ass off in a land-field
Son bless me with the iron, I got beef with
Some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clip, my crew strictly body shit
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North, son, I'm bent up
Doin' my dirt on a low
Fuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial, no doubt you gonna blow
You never know, he didn't even have to go
There unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I want, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good, I still die for the 'hood
For my peoples, yeah, knock on wood

Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama what I gotta say is short not long
This nigga that I'm beginnin' to dislike he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit, he might be dead
You know him well and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain’t no fear over here, dear, we just debatin'
On when and how, later or right now
Spoke to Killa yesterday, 
he said to chill for a while
But it's hard actin' like everythin' is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my eyesight
A dead man walkin', not only that. he's still talkin'
(About what?) About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day, my man and the next, he's not
Didn't know him long anyway, so fuck it
It's funny how things change (Word up!)

From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave

Up North Trip,The Infamous,1995.0,"It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is lookin
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Gettin shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hopin in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowin, home is a place you're not goin for a long while
Now you're up on the isle
And the position that you in got you refusin' to smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requestin PC
You're fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
Cause the war in population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a mac demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screamin'
What you in for kid - bustin nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories told inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that?
Wisen up youngblood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate yo set your crooked ass straight...

Make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked
You talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut
All that gossip, motherfucker don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught then my ass is up north
Straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin back to back cigarettes
It popped off, one point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my nine up to par so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do, run behind a tree
Fix my shit then hit you
Slugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue
Witness from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack, K-A black, find a shorty to tap


I got the power, combine wit the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause... and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin, and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back, it's a part of me
Too late for cryin, I'm a grown man strugglin
To reach the next level of life without fumblin
Down to foldin, I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first
Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
Cause niggas will have you locked up, the snitch be your man
Givin police the run down on your plans
We're never goin down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mine, fuck payin taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without

Bumped heads here and there, but never got the chance

Must be out his monkey-ass mind - how the hell he gettin tired of you?

Aiyyo what up with them Queens niggas man!
Hey, fuck you!
What? What the fuck, what?
Think they killers or somethin man
Ay fuck you money, whattup kid
*more chaos*

I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection
In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles
I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
And wilding, a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge
Black it's only crack sales makin niggas act like that
Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two
It's liable to start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us so show em where we come from
Queens; leavin niggas done son
The Mobb gets hectic

Shit is for real up in Queens we get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit
I'm living large pushin luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my way gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me
Son I got em shook grab a little baby for shields
You got drama run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill
Hit 'em up, 'cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the MAC scratch em off my list
Show 'em, the real meaning of drama you never had it
'Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat
Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat whole crews retreat

We gets hectic
Shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic

Everything is real inside my mind; these days
You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street living
Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given
But wilding ain't the way to be living
You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own
In a cell locked down not far from home
And at the same time on the outside I'm representing
Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
On the real, for real, but wait it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turn killer
It's thing like that that only makes things iller
And makin cream doin sticks if you ain't a drug dealer
(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see these streets is getting sour
Q, U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy I'm living in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed
Watchin all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation, the Queens nation

Up in Queens, shit is for real we abouts to get hectic
Word up
Shaolin, shit is for real we abouts to get hectic

Special deliver sending shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some sheisty New York niggas, thirsty for cheddar
You shining, you get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keeping these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up, and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-Packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top kid
And once we all on top ain't no stopping it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
You stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like force field, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware, of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching waiting for a come up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shaking your hand

Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine
My shit combine, dangerous minds done bust the outline
A half a man generating grands
Kid, you know how I go, only fuck with fam
That's why you're looking from the outside in
Wondering how we bubbling, hustling, breaking days in
Grimy motherfuckers, getting info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest
So I suggest change your location is best
'Cause I'm coming through army fatigue dressed
Blessed with hollow tips yes, to burn through your dirty ass Guess

A-yo, your timing was way the fuck off, what is you trying?
This faggot ass cat should get clapped for even trying
He tried to confront me but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science in numbers is how I live
If we ain't getting mathematics something got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strong arm robbery and ice picking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying, it's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate it's on you

Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy

Up the ladder of success with Tecs, we build and destroy

Yeah yeah yeah
Hold the fuck up
We gonna take this little intermission to listen
To what the fuck I got to say, you know
I been doing this shit for years:
Holding heat, selling
Using, abusing all kinds of drugs;
Robbing niggas, running up in niggas' cribs
You know, the whole shit
So don't ever in your life get me confused
With some of them other niggas that you might see
On TV
Or hear on the radio and such
Know what I'm saying?
I mean, this is me: P
I'm speaking for my fucking self
When you see me:
At the show
Or on stage
Or on the street
I DEFINITELY got the gat on me
You know what I'm saying?
And it ain't like I'm trying to be a tough guy
Or trying to make people think I'm crazy
By sayin' all this shit
But what it is, dat:
I know how niggas gets down, alright?
I used to be in the clubs:
The Muse, The Tunnel, whatever the fuck
Niggas get they little drink on
Havin'
Fun with they little crew

I'm gonna let you niggas know right now:
You ain't gotta waste your time
Or your money
On your hospital bills
And if you step to me on a personal level
I don't back down easy
There's a good chance your ass is gonna get
Shot, stabbed, or knuckled down
One out of the three
So don't gamble with your life, duke

I know very well I could get shot, stabbed or fucked up too, whatever

You know what I'm sayin?
So therefore, say no more
To all my niggas: Get the money
Frontin' niggas get deceased
And, oh yeah, to all them rap-ass niggas
With your half-assed rhymes
Talking about how much you get high, how much weed you smoke
And that crazy space shit that don't even make no sense:
Don't ever speak to me when you see me, know what I'm saying, word
I'ma have to get on some ole ""high school"" shit
Start punching niggas in they face just for living

Ya'll can continue on",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-the-infamous-prelude-lyrics
The Learning (Burn),Infamy,2001.0,"It be a buck-fifty, your chance of runnin is infinte
Slugs that leave niggas drugged like a chick slip the Mickey
I'm so on the low it'd take a Navy Seal to get me
When I surface, if not chips to Benz is the purpose
On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin
'til my eyes see the blood, that mean the creep start workin
Niggas never learnin that they eyes keep lurkin
Have ya janitor pumpin your X5 murkin
Skid marks the street, your heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga overcook that meat
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that cause forever I be needin 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin 'em
Some love, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin 'em
Niggas wanna ride by the crib all slow
We clap mothafucka, want a real rap show?
Fiends are rushin when the mack blow, dead in my castle
And in the blink watch how quick life pass you

What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin with that fire and that ass is gettin burned
Fuckin with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin all of y'all somethin to be afraid of
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin with that fire and that ass is gettin burned
Fuckin with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin all of y'all somethin to be afraid of

Let me tell you how it's goin down, it's on now
Niggas used to love me, now they wanna hate me now
I'm that same nigga with the tech, holdin the spot down
Except I'm pushin a Lex, lettin the top down
But wait, you don't think I live a pop life now
That's hate, you could get popped right now
Me don't play, I keep a gun around my way
And I'm a fuckin drama king like my nigga Kayslay
Sex, drugs, money and murder all day
It's rules, guidlines and codes, we obey
Don't even trip, IMD the set I claim
Infamous Mobb Deep nigga, ready to bang
Nigga don't think shit stink, then shit hit the fans
So I don't slip, I'mma shit with my gun in my hand
It's a thug thing y'all niggas wouldn't understand and
Y'all keep guns we keep our shit bangin

What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin with that fire and that ass is gettin burned
Fuckin with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin all of y'all somethin to be afraid of

You a bitch-ass nigga, I'll have you killed
All they had was your picture at the funeral
No casket, you bastards be missin
My jewels, my whip, my rims we bitchin
My guns be the heat that'll make you blister
My mens, my Timbs'll stomp you niggas
No shit, no clip, don't fuck with us
It's no problem, I bring it to the best of them
From the old to the new and the rest of them
No love, just slugs for ya body, dunn!
Just pain, just sufferin and worst than that
You let me get my hands on you so I'm takin advantage
And that shit that you pulled ain't do me no damage
You don't know me, nigga, but we bout to change that shit!
Wrap that nigga up like a package
Fuck all them niggas; buck all them faggots!

What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin with that fire and that ass is gettin burned
Fuckin with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave
We givin all of y'all somethin to be afraid of
What's wrong with mothafuckas when will they ever learn
Keep playin with that fire and that ass is gettin burned
Fuckin with semi-autos, one foot is in the grave

Yo, yo, y'know how we did on The Infamous album, right?
Aight, we gonna do it again son

Yo, laid up in the cut, watch these rap niggas fuck you up
Dig in shorty guts, get the bitch to set you up
It's the most trifle, 41st Side disciples
Take kindness for a weakness so I won't be so kind to
Niggas comin' through, I gave you birth kid, I'm sonnin' you
The Infamous got PC for days
We runnin' thru townships, fuckin' shit
Kid, we down shit
Hustle mad bricks, Queensbridge no doubt, rep the clique
9-6 droppin' wild on some Benz's
Some next shit, crash bar, ask the God
I remember when loadin' up the gats, beef settlin'
Ghetto peddling the Sonder
, shorty dead again
Songs about 'We all around the NC'
Cop the E series, jealous ones envy
Hate to see me but got the nerve to wanna be me
I bleach blind em, you can't see like Ste-vie
I'm on TV, Vidbox and all that
Still in the Bridge, now what's fuckin' with that?

My crew run wild, snatch chains and bracelets
Your time's wasted for figuring P
There's two sides of me
Snake niggas obviously, you get lumped somethin' horribly and then we calmly guzzle Spumantely and Dom Pérignonly
Move the crowds over, cruise the fuck out
After GOD drinks had to shoot our fuckin way out
Spark flyin' niggas dyin', bitches cryin' and shout
Mobb niggas to the exit, we out

(Ty) 9-6 load up the clips, the Infamous apocalypse
QBC on the L-I-E an sippin' Hennessey
And Remy, V-S-O-P, Ty Nitty jiggy
Eyes forever chinky, up in the Mariott
Tonnes o' hydro, black tuxedo, lay low
The 5-0-migos, the gigolo, what nigga?

My technique, official white meat
Internal bleeding he felt, heat then cold feet
QBC committee
, Ty Nitty hit the safe
The Phillipino's have mad ice and gold plates
We escape, ain't no turnin' back to Stat
Pushin back-to-back acs, gettin' cheddar
Drug smugglin' tri-state, catchin' faith
We don't hesitate, we regulate and evaluate, cut the cake!

My crew worthy, blood sweat and tears
And thirty years for years, extort niggas and drink beers
Tired of livin' life this way, crime pay
But for how long till you reach a downfall
Thug niggas surround Y'all, 4-pound Y'all

I'm tired of livin' life this way, crime pay

Party's over tell the rest of the crew
Yo P, it's on you, what you wanna do?
Whatever? 
Party's over tell the rest of the crew
Yo P, it's on you, what you wanna do?

Every day of my life since 11-2-74
On the street makin' non-stop CREAM galore
Packin heat, stickin' up weed stores and more
Collectin' interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper when things get real
I'm down to stick a NatWest Bank for my meal
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park Side
While I'll be outside slingin', you always hide
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
We're to the death, you and me, this beef for eternity
I'm goin' out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor and freeze you in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill but you dent from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya, because of that
Now I know where you lay your head at and that's that
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawnin'
Murder without warnin' the very next mornin'

Once we step through the door, party over, that's the endin'
You and your crew'll leave out, a bunch of dead men
Bump me and I'll bump you back
You ain't tough black, niggas like you just get their life jacked
But I'm a cool nigga til you push me to the limit
But try to play me and ya ass I get up all in it
Don't try to cop pleas now son, it's dead and done
(I gave you fair warning) So run and get your guns
It's on, time to show 'em how I perform
My attitude will transform, leave you dead plus wrong
Gettin' the flow within, representin' for Queens
Shit is real, why you hopin' that it's all a dream
But you can't wake up, one in the chest, you blessed
Chokin' off your own blood, don't blame me you brought your own death
[Chorus: Prodigy &

My beeper kept beepin', the other numbers started leakin'
'Who is this on my mind?' I was thinkin'
Then I realised it was my dun playin 9-1-1
Once I seen the numbers I ran for the fuckin' guns
My dun in trouble, I be there on the double
I jumped up in the bubble, yo kid where are you?
(1-14 between Manhattan and Morningside Avenue)
This happened just right out the blue
Ayo dun, fuck that bitch, tell her get off your dick
(But she's cryin' and she says she has feelings and shit)
Yo it's a set-up, them niggas got me fed up
Ty stay in the buildin', if they move fuckin' buck em
Get up off the scene, you know what I mean?
And hold yourself down with the mother fuckin' sixteen
Glock
, and get off they block
Then I hung up the cellular, ready to rock
And it's on

You get deaded in the streets, kid set it
You gots no credit, fool you get wetted
Up with the semi-auto Mac double numbered
'Did he shoot eleven or twelve?' is what he wondered
Nigga I got one more shot, you must be drinkin'
Put the heater to his head, watch him start blinkin'
'Am I goin to heaven or hell?' is what he's thinkin'
Switch to a bitch as his life start sinkin'
Down to a level of no return
Call it the heat 'cause when the slugs hit it definitely burns
Now chill and think about your life for real
Every member of my crew is livin' life for real
Got your self fucked into somethin' that you couldn't finish
Up against the fulliest squad and get diminished
I'm from Q-U-E another E-N-S
So why you small tough talk? I'm not impressed
If I seen you in the Bridge, I'd make you undress
Give up the money, the Polo, especially the Guess

Give It Up Fast,Hell On Earth,1996.0,"Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal, Papi? You heard the Feds almost got me?
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati, network with catch-a-body experts
In retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but back then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye, what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table, we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
""The World Is Yours"" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rocking linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam'
Aiyo, the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
Will ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand

Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC
, nigga rep your clique

Yo, son, I'm feeling it
Opposition want me dead, concealing shit
From gats got me living, kid, rushing through my pyramid
You secondary, 
go against the grain then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't having it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers
(Yo Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up)

The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He wanted to do me, slowly but surely
I peeked his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
(Put the chrome to his dome), let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up
Regulated his gat and backed him up
Stepped to the side, P, blast him up

Aiyyo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playing thug tried to approach me
(Yo, kill that nigga, man!)
All I remember was I shot for his throat, G
You see big guns in 3-D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burning my hip from hot gats
Burning my lip from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger, in the AM
These ante meridian cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning we throwing back some Cognac juice
Letting gats loose, the blue van blitz through
D's pissed too, couldn't find the pistol
Ay yo, hopped out the Lexus, holding my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it's slipped down its caliber
Looking for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from my fiery cup of hell juice
Some singed nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, 
you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train
Top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least

Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show

For the game, nigga, get out the business
You waste of space, substitute, here's a replace
We deface, smack the smile off ya fuckin face
Taint the taste, send ya home back to vacate
Get your shit together plus your mind straight

Yo, my empire strikes with the strength of poisonous snakes
My entire unit loaded up with snake niggas that hire stakes
We pull off a high stakes, great escapes, expand, shift team downstate
Dreams of growing old with my son to live great
Little man I'm plannin' to enhance your mindstate
The rebirth, a nigga who lived an ill life
The one before me was of an even more trife
My understandin', I'll raise you with precise plannin'
And put you on to the whole game of this planet
But I gotta survive in order to follow through
Plans to live lotto, me and my little kicko
Any man tryin' to stop us, he get wet tho
He couldn't withstand the snake bite, there is no antidote
Don't you put your hands too close and try to approach
I won't snap at you I'm goin' for throats
And when you feel my bite, ya sing high notes
I peeped you from deep and then you got cut close
My formulae: I live life do or die
Stare into the eyes of a deep wiseguy
Prodigy, turnin' niggas to protegés
My protegé, I advise ya ass to make way
Make way...for fully-auto gun spray
You're small prey, I'll easily bait and trap game
This man is half mad scientist-half sane
Create a rhyme labyrinth like poisonous cannabis
Here, take a toke of this deadly rare vocalist
Overpower y'all, tiny noise like locusts
Like sunlight thru a magnifying glass I'll focus and burn
A hole straight through ya brain and leave ya open (Oh shit!)
And let the venom soak in
You start sweatin' and goin' through convulsions from dope shit I writ
Leavin' niggas stuck, I let stick
Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick
I'll wrap you up in cocoon, get caught up in the midst
A dangerous, it's risky business fuckin' with this
Contender number one I put you on top of the list
You're the best challenger so far, I'll give you this
But peep this (What?) fatal shots that solar plex
Man Down...now who dares to go next?
Like General Monk Monk orders to chop necks
I send a message to my whole clique to bomb shit
Atomic, no time for calm shit
We hyperactive when it’s time to Vietnam it

Up in the laboratory, that's why your small rhyme bore me
Your store bought rap ain't shit, my category

You wanna square off, I'm saying 'slice that cat'

Searching for signs of the end, well I am that
Which bring, apocalypse to this game called rap
Not a game but quite serious and yo in fact
You'll be running for dear life so far you might fall off the map
Fucking with P, you need the gat
At least you have the opportunity to bust back
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack a rare world premier
Shook individual bounce in blind fear
Scared to death niggas fall to they worst fear

Just Step (Prelude),The Infamous,1995.0,"Yo son, tell 'em about that bullshit they put you through

Yo son, word is bond dun
Sometimes I wish I had three different faces
I'm going to court for three cases in three places
One in Queens, Manhattan, one in Brooklyn
The way things is looking I'mma see central bookings
Facing three 3 to 9's is mad time
After ran concurrent for assault and 2-9's
I gotta maintain cause stress on the brain
Can lead to a motherfucking suicide thing
And plus my probation, a ill violation
How the fuck did I get in this tight situation?
I'm going all out you know moves I never fake
And fuck the jake, they can catch me at my wake
And if I die, burn a bag of blade
Put the lye in the air sometimes I just don't care

Son I got plans, power movements, get on some rude shit
I keep living like this, I might lose it
My man's coming home from doing long ass bids
What up, Kicko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids
It's all strange; my niggas locked down thinking long range
And see their names in the Daily News third page
They sent a kite to my nigga Killer
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squealer
A 3 to 9 spending most of his time inside the 
bing

Time to let these niggas know, son
Niggas don't even wanna motherfuckin' understand
KnowhatI'msayin? Time to hit 'em with the 3rd degree
Yeah, you know the QBC, here to drop a G
Yo...

Look into the eyes, True Lies, your whole click despise
Especially me, H-A-V-O-C
Don't want your chick, cuz she's burnin' third degree
Plus you snitchin', you ain't got no ties on me
I keep it strong, while you scream word is bond
Lyin' through your teeth, swearin' on your first born
Your word is weak, don’t hold no weight in this
Hit you up quick, strictly shit that I'm livin' in
You walk a line that's thin, you religious? Well, you sin
Fuckin'' with the Mobb, Infamous to the end

I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc
Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it
And kept drivin', pull off like the Indy 5G
In a four time Ford truck with Speed
Like the motion picture, this nigga Gone With the Wind
My crime work, ninja style shit was did
And got away with, escaped it, the Jakes from tracin'
Anythin' that lead to the source, you know the boss
Of the Mobb killin', is like an Unsolved Mystery
Puzzlin', nobody knows, it's all history
Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get thugly
Never fails, it's always somethin'
No rest, daily gotta rock my vest
I shoot at your best man, yeah, your MVP
He played the front line, got struck down immediately
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps wind
Heavy load, my military hold ammunition
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not?
My crew, kings of New York who takin' your spot
I put the green light on your whole click, Island shit
Runnin' through the whole house wildin', extortin'
(Extortion, hit that up, extortion, hit that up)

Extortion is the key, I got the key for extortion
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion
Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in
You married to the Mobb, can't take it? Then divorce it
'Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes
If you scared, get a dog, don't got a clique? Then recruit
You're weak troop, lost battalion in the mist
On your name I shit, take it like a man, you little bitch

I blaze yo' britches, P.L.O. extortion
You forcin'
The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter
This Shaolin representer, carry 36 deadly shits
You fuckin' with top contenders, official to the bone gristle
It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols
Remember me? 
Burn a nigga to a 3rd degree
Don't act familiar, motherfuckers, you ain't heard of me
Just peep the stee and the rap, how it's supposed to be
Tap the pockets, bag the goods like a grocery, we food-shoppin'
On top of that we hip-hoppin', and don't stoppin'
Out-of-state drawers-droppin', the panty-raiders
Slide on ya like gators
Dug that stank bitch back out and then played her
But that ain't nothin'
Crossin' this dog walkin', native New York and
Shaolin' slang talkin', rap nigga, Mr. Freeze, crowd shiver, w
hat?
Young, black and don't give a fuck
If the next crew get the scissor...
(Extortion, extortion, give that up kid, extortion)
Bottom line, what the fuck you wanna do?
You eyin' me, at the same time I'm eyin' you, punk
Wanna pop the most junk
Be the same motherfucker with the most lumps

Back at You,Sunset Park (Soundtrack) ,1996.0,"No doubt

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Stainless steel gats, they never rust, fit to bust
You get touched, blessed with the real side of life
Just enough, you couldn't fight it with your strongest mic
Laid down nigga eyes, visualize bad reception
Major interference shoot your upper body section
I travel like a two-two bullet, throughout your body
Repped to the fullest, Queensbridge representin'
Presentin', the hollow tip crew
Loose lips sink ships, you talk shit I follow through
Once the kite is sent, I might get bent but still planted
No second thoughts, 'cause my conscience is demandin'
For the bloodshed (bloodshed), I leave that mug red (mug red)
I'm like cancer can't catch me cause I done spread (done spread)
Doorknob dead
, enough said from the scene I fled
With the paranoid thoughts runnin' round my head
It's like that, war, project niggas strike back
It's on, what the fuck you said? I'll be right back
With the gat, and temper, end your motherfuckin' era
Your shorty set you up you better dead her
Hunger for the cheddar, big Benz or better
Armeretto sours, alcohol assumption
While you, runnin' we thumpin'
Due to the fact The Infamous is bumpin'
Ice grill, son you frontin'

It's like that, war, project niggas strike back
It's on - what the fuck you said? I'll be right back
It's like that, war, project niggas strike back
It's on - what the fuck you said I'll be right back

It's on - what the fuck you said I'll be right back
It's like that, war, project niggas strike back
It's on - what the fuck you said I'll be right back

Welcome to the fact that, here take that
Right back at you, I'm goin at Duke, already ran through
Wasn't hard to capture, what is it that your goin' after?
(What is it what is it?) My forty-fifth'll make your clothes damper
Put in the hamper, the fabulous Infamous movin' stainless
Crimes heinous, to all my niggas hold your bangers
Live in action, if you were dapped then relax then
The fuck you said? I'll be right back with MACs then
Blastin', tearin' up your Fila fashion
Give him what he askin', fill you in on what happened
Back at the cabin, be at the round table plannin'
To spread team across planet, expand shit
Slap a nigga open handedly style, somethin' foul
For tryin' to slow down, my cash pile a hundred miles (so what)
I can recall the days, juvenile crime pays
Fourteen years old, shorty from round way
Brick-ass cold, still pump from night to day
But why did my life have to be this way?
I rock Velour suits, flavors like mixed fruits
My loot give recoup, 
razors in my shoe
'Case they try to troop me to the Island
I'm known for start whylin'
Back in New York, my soldiers got the cash pildin'
Peep this, throwin' blows on some nose and teeth shit
So much drama, who the fuck knows we got beef with?
Lift you up off your feet like ski lift
Pull back the big fifth for niggas who riff, them niggas you with
Then I'm on the next flight, gettin' bent in the clouds
On my way down South for international crowds

Word up, word up son, we gotta get this motherfuckin' money kid
Knahmsayin? What up kid? Fuck that son

Let's get lifted, Queens is you with me?
Niggas' shifty, I turned around, a kid tried to hit me
I back him down with the 50-50
It had to been the thug in me
The Tunnel banging come and get me
The first five hundred bitches free
The kid with the God-U will let all my gods come through
Live niggas on this side of the bar, you get smacked, boo
And fucked too, shit on me? Well then, fuck you
Gone with your high class ass if you want to
Outta state you be suckin' me off and breakin' off
Weave bitch thinks she's stallion but my dick went soft
My Mobb got in lock with Masterlock
You get your locks picked
Run up in your spot, mask and glove shit
Queens niggas involved with thug shit, you get lumped'd
Quick, we in the bathroom thumpin'

To the three-time losers, alcohol abusers
Big money spenders and the Ebineezer Scroogers
Thugs holdin' fort with the sixteen shot Rugers
The CREAM that I redeem will bring a Lex and Landcruiser
Dominant chapter, assassin'in the obsolete
And my Mobb comes Deep to put the wind beneath your feet
My heart's harder than concrete, and nervous streets
Be walked offbeat, but still thugs carry heats
I get deeper than skin, paragraphs from within
Dear lord, my life is trife, please forgive for me sins
My kin stay my kin, ain't no room for extra friends
One love to my thugs up north in the pens
Be a prophet to raise, beat my speech on stage
Lyricist renegade, breakin' down barricades
These days are gettin' rough, another brother handcuffed
Fallen victim to the game it's like style's corrupt

My crime niggas live the (Street life)

For every rhyme I write, reality bites
My clique keeps shit virgin tight
Regulate and know the rule
I gets some insight plus info, doin' stickups with my kickos
My .44 will burn that ass like going raw with nymphos
So protect your lifestyle, rock your vest
Or get your Teflon put to the motherfuckin' test
State pen put on points, son you know
Stay on the low, got the back, or no-no
When I'm on the dolo, got the God-U-Now
Kid, you wanna get foul, so now I gotta put that ass back on profile
Change your character, you ain't got stamina
Nigga get that dough, I ain't mad at'cha
The Infamous handle business, gonna make mines
Forever, son, kid you heard it through the grapevine

To my royal thug committees and outlaws that live the life of 
Frank Nitty
The big city mobster, the ? has made the
God unholy, skies forever watch me
The prophecy, another chapter, there's no stoppin' me
Crime Addiction, my life story is far from fiction
Because at one time, the .44 bullets took the world, bring sparks and friction
I anaylse this Earth, so I roll with trife characters
The hardest for the world to cap, and shining like a
Full carat diamond with perfect design
Philly's and 9 mili's and Coupe Bentley's forever reclinin'
To the shoot, physicals in this paradox
The world is hot and my plot is to receive grands and yachts
Until then I be a trife individual, dwellin' in these days
Scorchin' from the D's plus the sun's rays
Dead President dreams and million dollar schemes
Killer Queens, the land of CREAM fiends

Stainless Rugers for the intruders and my cipher's Infamous
Through New York and worldwide, we penetrate your inside

The Realest,Murda Muzik,1999.0,"This the killa's shit, dun
No doubt, the undisputed

For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

Yo, when the gats reveal you cats get peeled
And that's the deal
Fuck a bitch-ass that switch fast niggas that lack the real
When the slugs burst
G Rap be aiming at your mug first
Niggas is blood thirst, we'll see who get plugged worst
We dug earth, the place we put the nickel-plate is to your facial
Bullets ain't racial, kid, they only hate you
My nine'll seem like it's a time machine, B.C. date you
Jacking you more than Ripper
My fifth's an organ shifter, the human organism lifter
You'll be hearing organs if ya leaving orphans, if ya
Let these fours hit ya where the Lord split ya
I forbid ya..to bump heads with those that dump lead
Accurate shots in back of your knot
Leave you one dead, G Rap, Havoc and Prodigy
Let's put these bitch niggas
Where bodies be dun, yo if it gotta be, it gotta be

For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

When the gat spit some niggas get blown off the atlas
It happens unsolved mystery re-enactments
Get practiced what you lack is you think like the average
Jake stoop down and leaving crime scenes entangled
Nothing but cannons get conspicuous
Like a man a little branded with the serial scratched
Bad apple out of the batch, dun they made me like that
If I could push back the clock probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my nigga G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here plus my kin
Killa B forever with me, quick to settle with me
Into QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns we got guns the serious ones
Leaving foul powder stuck in your lungs
We come from where niggas look out for they dun-duns
Love, never disrespect, hit niggas with re-direct

For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night
This be the realest shit you heard in your life

Never prejudge, it be the humble that squeeze slugs
It be the ones standing still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my dunns thugging for me
Man you don't wanna get involved fucking with P
I spent more nights illing, less nights chilling
The more shots they hold the better they feel it
What be the deal is some killers like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespecting and the rest
Or so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be bursting off guns like a Vietnam vet
On the steps, sitting in the staircase bent
Thinking on ways to take another man's head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips, switch clothes after I spit
Place niggas back in they space, fuck is on your mind kid

For street niggas living with they lives on the line
For young guns coming up during these times
For police that find drugs let niggas slide
For niggas out slinging like 4 in the night
For your mans not snitching when the pressure is tight
For pistols that don't jam when it's time to strike
For bootleg liquor on a Sunday night

Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at

Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, ""Freeze black kids!""
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

Yo you fam to me, and only fam to me
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong

Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers

Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight

I mean, that's why I keep my mouth tight
Ain't got no words for y'all niggas, man...y'all niggas is crazy

Hey yo, it's hell on earth down here the pavement scorching
It's molten rock when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you
I understood, you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too, damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until I made things right
Pull out guns, exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines, ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight decieve
During the sun's hours niggas do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggas can't shoot, never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop
Fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when it's bolt-locked, nigga

Have you ever lost a loved one?
Or never understood love 'til you lost one?
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at?
Strength missing, to take losses is the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest
Strive regardless. Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
Now lets find out where niggas hearts' at

This is to my physical, you gone, to me you still here
I be buggin' thinking how you doin' up there
Probably watching over me, calling out my fouls
Fuck with mad chicks but I take care of my child
I miss that ass, tell God I said ""Pardon me""
If you're real; He'll forgive me 
But I ain't crying no more about how you're gone
Used to hold me down; niggas front, it's on
Ain't sweating going to jail, you better shoot me
Just lost my heart-If I die, you comin' wit' me
Quickly, while I'm pissy
They're just bitches that's a little too frisky, risky
On point, hope these cats is getting the point
Whisper out my name, stare but please don't point
Call me paranoid
But I'm on point, close by the stash joint
Got you in my mind, I guess that's why the say love is blind

Strength missing, we take losses, be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
You better finish what you started, dunn
If you ever lost a loved one
You'll never understand love 'til you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mine behind with my dearly departed
Where your heart at?
Strength missing, to take losses be the hardest
The ones that overcome be the calmest, strive regardless
Where your heart at? Brave-hearted
Now let's find out where niggas' hearts at
Have you ever lost a loved one?
You'll never understand love 'til you lost one
Where your heart at?
I left mines behind wit' my dearly departed
Now where your heart at?

I find myself dozing off with it 
Waking up every forty minutes 
Soaking wet, dripped to death in it
On top of rules, big barrels and tools get tested
And hittin' off makes my dick get erected
We all strive for a better tomorrow
But as far as today, your ass gots to pay
And ain't no time better than the present one at hand
And never keep your shit too far from your hand

Think about this are you with your hands on who you running with
Some timers, player haters and dick riders
Bent niggas that be crashin' into dividers
Gettin' you into shit, got that ass tied up
Got them la'd up, got you comin' out of your vault
With no plans of giving back, live in serious debt

Mobb Deep style from the depths of Hempstead, get ninja'd
I creep quiet, keep the live nigga inching, listen
Who are you to throw your fist in? Hit like a bitch
Run like a faggot and take the whole shit
That's it, I had to pass here with the shit
It's time for showtime, let's see how deep things get
You want to talk tough and get all delinquent
You find yourself all bloodied up and shameded
Me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit
Bust a gat, give me no fear of that, I'm laughing
What's up there? Let's take you there and touch something
I'm a maniac, brainiac, fanatic for that
Capable of combat, P counterattack
In some hot wheels, sending shots out from the back
It was a foul way to go, Kicko
You know the ropes so (Bloodsport, mothafucka)

Ayo, the rottweiler, chewin chihuahua ass niggas
Pull em on your collar and let the lights dimming
And you'll be swimmin in a puddle of reality juice
Fatality too, this rap shit is the bitch you shouldn't married into
To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read em on the humble
And while you shinin in the spotlight
I got this dot right, the aimed right a stoplight
The trife life, ain't no part two's
When it's over it's over you hit, now send your soldier lease through",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-bloodsport-lyrics
Pearly Gates,Blood Money,2006.0,"Is it true what the good book say
Concerning the Judgement Day?
If I don't kneel down and pray
Will I be a sinner for—

Yeah, homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate, and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talked my way up out the hood

Now if you followed my footsteps and walked through my shoes
You wouldn't go against me cause you know you would lose
It's been a long time coming, I done paid my dues
Now everytime I turn around, it's like I'm back in the news
I know a lotta niggas want me wearing cement shoes
And Uncle Tom niggas wanna see me locked up too
Around the same time KRS was writing ""Black Cop""
I was busy tryna pump cracks in the back blocks
Popping shit to my homies 'bout how my gat pop
Got rid of that chrome thing and got a black Glock
P-90 hold ten but I had six shots
I used to walk around wit' it and risk gettin' knocked
I bought a fresh box of bullets from Old Man Sam
Wanted to shoot a nigga so bad, it was itching my hand
Some shot it out with me, and some of 'em ran
And some of the gats worked good and some of 'em jammed

Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way up out the hood
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way up out the hood

Now if you take a good look and look into my face
A nigga wouldn't even dare to violate my space
Son I did so much dirt, I'm tryna clean my slate
And ate so many niggas food and now they want mines ate
The dogs bark when I walk and sense the souls I took
Moms pray for me with her right hand on the good book
Saw shots fly by me, know I should've been dripping
The pulp fiction musta been God's divine intervention
Wouldn't thought then from that, I've learned my lesson
And clean my act up and go straight to confession
Uncle La got knocked, the Feds hit him with seven
And left me with the 50 cal. and a MAC-11
Stuck everything from everything, from heads to the workers
And had half the hood damn near wanting to murk us
Found myself asking God, ""What the fuck is my purpose?""
You go to heaven, know I'm foul but put a good word in

Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way up out the hood
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way up out the hood

Now homie if I go to hell and you make it to the pearly gates
Tell (the boss man) we got beef
And tell (his only son) I'ma see him when I see him
And when I see him, I'ma (beat him like the movie)
For leaving us out to dry in straight poverty
For not showing me no signs they watching over me
Look, we a new breed in 2006
We don't give a fuck about that (religious bullshit)
Nigga show me where the cash at
The nice whips with the three car garage to fit them shits
Man my life is painful, you pray to angels
I'm praying to myself hoping I ain't got to spank you
My bullets'll shank you
And when my guns start cutting, ain't nobody gon' save you
In the Bible times, they ain't had to deal
With the shit we dealing with, these survival times

Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow, I'm good
Shit, I done talk my way up out the hood
Homie if I go to hell and you make it to heaven
Just get me to the gate and I'll talk my way in
Got a gift, I'm special with the flow I'm good

More Trife Life,Hell On Earth,1996.0,"Yo, yo son
Pussy will bring you in this motherfucker
Damn sure take you out too kid
Check this shit out

A rainy day laid up thinkin', sittin', gettin' bent
Watchin' old '70s flicks
Mind's on the slouch back in the couch, heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from Uptown I met back day
Long time no hear from, no doubt, long time no see
""I heard you had a seed, a baby girl and now she's three
What's up wit that cat, you know who, your baby pops
Slung rocks up top then heard he got knocked""
""He home, fuck that nigga, I'm on my own
Matter fact got my own crib, plus I'm all alone""
Word? The bitch is bad, chill son, she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented
Fresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E & J straight, was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug
See, ain't seen the bitch since back then and that was bug
Turned the VCR on, Friday, my favorite flick
Offered me a drink, Alizé, I take a sip
Got into convo, ""How you been over the years?""
""Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear""
""What you mean? I thought you left that cat,"" which was true
""I'm not talkin' about him, another dude
Been with him for a year and had a baby by him
Matter fact, you saw him downstairs, you walked by him""
Now I'm thinking setup, could it be or maybe not
She said, ""Don't sweat it, he don't got the top lock""
Tried to play it cool, but in my head shorty's wildin'
Using me to get the next nigga jealous, called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy so I beeped Gotti
Gotti was with Trip and two other grimeys
The Twins, ""Let me begin, then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, not prepared for combat""
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be there in a second, big gats no half steppin'
They flippin' on me, talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson
I laugh in additional, hit them with the math
Hung up the jack, while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up, shorty was standing ass naked
Make moves, all this bullshit pussy better be good
Stepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood
Slow motion, all along bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over, laid up in the cut, I heard a thump
Jumped up, threw on my boxers, yo, what the fuck?
All the sudden, I saw this black motherfucker
With this big ass gat and two other motherfuckers
Black masks, clutching duct tape, no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up, saw 'em schemin'
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this""
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up, held for ransom
They yelled, ""We got the bones,"" smiled, then started dancin'
The phone rung, it was my sons, they let 'em know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone, said, ""Son, don't worry, yo, we got this""

And losing again for real like Armageddon
Tec sweating your direction, your face change complexion
My whole life been destined, as sure as the moon shaped crescent
Caressing these raps like back rubs in bathtubs
I'm blessin', mics of all types, learn a lesson

You know the drill, QB on the hill where I chill
41 side still real, it ain't gone change
My niggas think long range, crack a skull frame
Simple and plain, fake niggas want claim fame
Real niggas up north, the Rock, Sing Sing
It don't make a diff, dunn, first nigga riff, dunn
We hit dunn, make his whole shit numb

With a touch of class, handle that ass
Two aluminum bats, ruin them cats, two exclusive gats
Doing them cats, my crew's in the back, losing it, black

Full force, we blast at your main source

As I sit back, dunn, I think about my past
When my moms had no cash, and my first time catching crabs
Or at the time when my brother got splashed
It hurt my ass, to see him pass
But now I gotta keep it moving to get this cash
You better kill his ass, if you wanna pass
These premises full of menaces, kid
Called The Infamous; forgive but we never forget
All that fake snake shit, kid, I never regret
'Cause I learn from mistakes that be guiding my steps

Long chrome noses up, my gun blows
Your legs turn noodles, you shot a few going down
I give you that much, you went out
Close but no ci-gar, you must be a fucking retard
Extending your arm in my direction, you better squeeze hard
My rank is that of utmost respect
Y'all niggas only know what you heard on cassette
Manifest words in the flesh

Take your most VP dunn, leave them like the letter T
You won't see me run, unless it's police

We come through the spot real heavy on the waist
So when they wanna move, we put 'em in they place

Yo, I was schooled by the hood, raised by the wolves
Trained by the pain, adopted by guerillas
Gotta tank for a car, ice for a arm
Got tattoos wit' skin and scars from brawls
Gotta buildin' for a crib, Manhattan for a backyard
Skyscraper ladies, they fuck me when they man gone
Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those
Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals
You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I get paid, cause I got murder 'fore sixteen
And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank
So much stash, I just laugh at yo' face
Blow a stack on David, cause I'mma pyro
Maniac from carriage, wit' the Rolls Gold
I was told by the O.G.'s like my Pops
If you can't whip they ass, then niggas get shot (shot, shot)

Hustled by the bus stop, aged to the front stop
Block party departed,

Right before I snatch this little number from my hottie

Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix
Fast forward to '06, gettin' head in the '06
Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex
I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision
Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin'
From that hallway kissin', there was room in the Carlton
I can smell it in the air, P in that next room sparkin'
Me, I let that heady flow, meet me at the tele' ho

Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin'
Look down and see dry blood all on my garment
It stained all my Guess formers, kevlar'd enormous
I hopped up, outta my bed holdin my head
Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head
I can recall an eight man brawl three men fall
Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?
I kick that '98 shit for your ears to list
Nigga P way ahead of his time, surpassed kids
(Fuck you kids be doin' yo?)
Kickin' rhymes that's true lies
Let me break 'em down to size minimize they air time
After this you never will go back to that which
Sit back an' write half ass shit
The last official taking out the artificial
Let me relieve you replace that shit with some lethal
Mobb, remember the name it's been along
That nigga's shook to death from the first fuckin song
Fluidly my mind flooded with jewels infinite
The kinda rap bandits in attics stuck on some live shit
Bear witness to this diligent street cat
I carry myself hold myself down in fact
This one dedicated to my niggas on run
Holdin big gats go for your gun
Prepare to crush them we trust none
Man who ain't down with the clan
The Mobb dynasty apparantly you thought I was some other type
Nigga you could fuck with you shit outta luck
Boss I break your compass throw you way off course

Little P wanna be me, huh you no D

One time son you know we be the illest in this
Push the shit back, QBC gat, plottin to move back
The big mouth cat ship'll sink to the bottom
Easily overthrowin niggas, rollin over niggas

Yo crushed krills, dollar bills, swish suit on
Screw on, dry-cell nigga with his loot on
Watch this, thunn Glock less, fiends scopin out my rock shit
Diamond on some H&R Block shit
Hear me, kids leary and his sneakers are shot
Word to me thunn, the uniform do mean a lot
I approach lit up cousin sit up matter of fact get up
What, fronts on the bottom face lit up
Yeah where you from I'm from here
You know Brina and Javier, and Little Life doin thirty years
Analyzin this wise guy a look alike first prize guy
Lit up the thai stick (riiiiight!)
Emotionally playin him close like I'm supposed to be
Somethin spoke to me, it was this little nigga pokin me
I heard sirens now turn around about to hit em
Son was p-o nine with the emblem
Grabbed my goose down the walkie-talkie
Foul I'm loose now shot went off knocked the juice down
It ricocheted and hit a GS now here comes EMS, Dunn was leanin near a ZX
Next time shit's parental, God slap fire out yer mental
Jet in a boat with rims dimensional


Know why?

From Riker’s Houses to the street’s pavement

First of all the foundation, money is the root of all evil
The cream will have you shitting on your people
Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm Making figures that I never thought was possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras
Kid you'll get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off Moët, spending a G on beers
Living life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking, you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
Im trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team died
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky
While the rest still living steady telling me lies
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

I got your life in arms reach, With a slug for each and any
The clip is filled up I'm hitting til its fucking empty
Presenting, the hollow tip crew, take heed to the message that we sending at you
Choking off your own blood watch you face turn blue
Ain't that some shit, the damage that a bullet can do
Make you change the way you thinking, niggas speed while you blinking, too late
On your way home, you left a trail leaking
I bet you next time you'll listen up while I'm speaking
Now you're laid up in ICU for the weekend
At the same time I'm outside getting my thug on
The same eyes got my mind fucking bugging

Stash CREAM, keys on a triple beam

Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in
New York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar moving all your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting

My teams hot collecting mad cream, we slingshot
My ring's rock icy
 like a fuck with a green drop
Call me santa with more snow than montana
Camouflage Wu emblem on my bandana
Play fair sight, never in a million these cats bite
Folding under pressure like beach chairs
Drug money, hundred dollar nights plus flights around the way
Burning biggys on bikes its only right
Two for fives 95, five 25s didn't I

Prepare to stay long, cause I don't cum quick
Little or big, I tear that ass out the frame
Talkin like you're ill, but the shit is all game
You're weak on top, you can't ride like a stallion

But if you're ill we can chill smoke the fat Phil'
A little somethin just to make shit real
Off with the light, fuck a invite, just make sure

Quick to talk dirty to a sister
I met the shorty at the Skate Key
What's her name? Nevermind, cause she might try to sue me
Juiced her up, took her to the projects
So uh, if she was with it maybe we could have sex
You know what happens next, drop to your knees
Bitch caught a bone ? spin I win
As she starts to proceed, she said she wanted me
To drop a seed, I told her parlay and just be
Cause cunt little stunt with my butter dick shorty
You talk too much, so lay back and enjoy the blunt
I put it in her, she starts to wild
She said slow down, I said this is shorty wop style
A versatile, rough sex, fuck love makin

Take it In Blood,The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014.0,"I'm yawning while I wake up to the early morning gunfire
Another day another scar to acquire
Jumped out my bed, tried to break my alarm
Took a shower, and then I strapped on my firearm
Grabbed my Pelle Pelle cause I wanna look fly when I die
But it ain't my turn to say goodbye
How do I know? Some people call it instinct
I like to call it my luck, who gives a fuck
I'm stuck, in this environment and can't depart from it
And if I try I always end up back where I started
Plan A, square 1, there's no escapin'
So I've come to realize my truth
Tryna live my full life before my time is through
Clocks tickin', so I don't got no time for you
As I head outside, amongst the rest of the animals
Is where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand still
It's sorta like a family bond
We gather up all the soldiers and form into an invincible
Swarm of kids, now it's on again
Drinking straight from the bottle warm gin dripping down my chin
For the crippled children, you can't win against 25 niggas bent up with mac 10 semi-automatics, fully-addicted crime addicts
So long as there is cash involved, I gotta have it
There's many different levels to the criminal mind
Either you in it for the money or you wasting your time

My destiny will be the death of me
Forever loving my peoples
Hustling, It's only right, nigga we struggling to survive
It's only crime that provides for me
So I resort to puffing dimes and dreaming of pushing a ride
Negative thoughts fill my brain but it's the projects to blame
Niggas forever getting loot while standing out in the rain
So when the sun shine, nigga will be writing a rhyme
And if a nigga owing, blood is how I'm taking mine
As I climb the ladder, of success with TEC's
Though I rather not have to watch my back get threat
But it's like that, so I adjust, fuck getting touched
Your man wasn't aware, that's why that nigga got bucked
I realize open my eyes once this shit got real
There's mad drama on the Hill when niggas getting blue steel
I love my niggas for that, we keep it real, get loot
And our identity is Timbs and army certified suits
Most def, my people hold me down whenever in beef
Talking all that bullshit but it's the gats that rules the streets
Survival of the fittest automatics recommended
Given a life sentence to crime until my life is ended

Niggas wanna point guns in my face, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Niggas forever talking shit, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Try to jam me on pack, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
Niggas running out their mouth, so what?
I'm taking mines in blood
How we do it, how we do it
We taking ours in blood. (x2)

This city got me trapped like an animal with criminal thoughts
I can't seem to turn away from this unknown force
If only I can lay my hands on the source of my trouble
And maybe I can heal my scar before it bubble
It's like a plague, and there ain't no cure
We absorb this world's filth, therefore we're un-pure
My life is like a bad dream I can't seem to shake
Only my peoples who are equal understand or relate
The way we live is never planned, it just happened that way
So until tomorrow I'll just be surviving today
It's just another man, on this planet living for delf
Pops gone, I had to learn to be a man myself
But I, don't stress that
He did his dirt, now he pays back waiting in a federal laid back
Pops, times is different and things ain't the same
It's worse than ever, to get paid we do whatever
See some rather achieve goals and be a scholar
I rather get locked like you, earning a 6-digit dollar
Making the desert bird holler
Doing white collar crimes, but the fed time is hard to swallow
And digest so I protest the pen
I rather die before the jail cell sucks me in
And my peoples we all share the same thinking
We in synch, on the same tempo, making cowards run petro
Pull out the TEC, automatic metro
My shots chase you 'round corners
Leaving your family a bunch of mourners
And my all-around point as that
If you feel me you're guaranteed something you can feel back

Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for self
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night  had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like ""Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,""
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then convict them of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping packs for free, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go
Lye got me on point, paranoid for life
That's why I walk the street with heat especially at night
I represent the North side I hold the title with pride
And when its on, I use the infra-red for guide
Aim it at your temple, with no remorse and never sentimental
My crew is cold-hearted from all the foul shit we been through
Surviving shootouts, bullets hitting the fence sparking
Fuck my fingers, with guns niggas I'm marking til the blocks darkened
Doing my thing, let my gun clap
It's like that!",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-take-it-in-blood-lyrics

Went from pumpin bags on the block, straight to the top
So the money ain't a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hamptons
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss player play, nigga I'm ballin
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in a cherry red Porsche, beige seats, red pipin
You want me to teach you how to stunt, aight then
Tattoos on the arm, 30 karats on the charm
Cause the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the Don
First night if I don't hit, second night I want some shit
Third night we call it quits, I ain't fuckin with the bitch
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Another move another mill', let's get right - aight?

Curtis got one so when I finished I tossed her
Y'all into wifin, we don't condone lifin
Only fuck with bitches that, got they liquor license
Shop high prices, shook all vices
Infamous nigga got the game in a vice grip
Chain hundred K but the flow, is priceless
Anything less? We rollin them dices
Nuts in the sand if you ain't bumpin my shit
Shorty wanna rip to my sound and my likeness

Hey! Go 'head and touch your body like you want to

Listen - you can call me Gambino P or V.I.P
My wrists could buy a bitch a Ph.D
My rings alone could pay for you to eat
For the next few years I'm so icy kid
My flow is long money, my face is Hollywood
My tattoos gon' keep me with a thug part though
My attitude is universal, get harmed - call money
When we get back to Queens we gon' hurt you
Can't afford to ride, you gettin stomped out
I got a team of dimes, they all thonged out
Ready to line you up and take you out
My girls is hot man, they hard to turn down

Get Dealt With,Hell On Earth,1996.0,"I got my clique ready, ready for hand-to-hand combo
Palms break him down, Rapper Noyd cut his throat
Don scoop 'em up, ah, Gotti stomp 'em out
Each twin grab a arm, pick this nigga up
Nitty turn his face to me and let me wake him up
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big
It almost took his whole face off
We got the team positioned, ready for face-off
We blitz like Dallas in the Superbowl faceoff
We form like niggas in the yard up north
With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost
And take your life lost, never found again boss
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths
Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit
Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah you a sick
Lunatic nigga jump up but got hit
With Macs and Tecs and silencers spit
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
That's the sound of a nigga, almost felt it
Got you runnin', dodgin', coverin', shelterin'
Bullets rippin' through the fabric of your shirt, it's meltin' in
You bleed again, you just another nigga dealt with
Intruder Alert! Our house is nothin' like the Covenant
We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven

Yo, if it ain't drama, money or bum, broke bitches
Simple minded niggas, out for Havoc position
That's opposition, wettin' me competition
Suddenly and outta the blue and now I see
Find myself, by myself and rollin' mad trees
Paranoid on point and now I see who's who
Distinguish fake ones outta the immediate crew
Life I take one if you jeopardize mine, duke
You're small, minute, got a deck to deal with aces up
You overbidded and in the Bridge you got stuck
This ain't a card game but in perspective it's the same
Put two and two together—Mobb Deep with one name
Contain drama like Outbreak
You order drama, we outtake, then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you up from the waist up
That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
But our beats bangin', got ya whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin', 4 pound left ya ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete
Niggas is trash rhymin', totally offbeat
And outta sync with they life, E & J bent tight
Niggas, slow ya roll
Ya speedin', now you bleedin' tonight for no reason
Wanna be macks and thugs, get smacked, show no love
Crush your team like a bear hug
The Infamous'll do dirt that'll smear like mud
New York, New Yitty, Queens, I feel no pity, no remorse
Takin' it to the source of course
Bare that ass thug real kid, it's only your mask
That you wear, take off, cop out, feel the blast
Who on top of boom gat-for-gat
And all the wolves got the drop on you
And let the nickel nine pop on you

Yo, my crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats blowing outta your back
What the deal with them tough looks and eye contact?
Starin' all up in your cornea, your cornea lack
The look of a true-to-life
Crime niggas attack
Go at the first nigga that front and overreact
Ya get dealt with

Hoodlum,Hoodlum - Music Inspired By the Motion Picture ,1997.0,"Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me
But is it the Henny that bend me; I be in the zone
Gazing at the walls, deppressed, iggin' the phone
They take it personal, but only a minor few can understand
What a nigga feeling; 41st 'til I die motherfucka (No doubt)
I'm still breathing; you a mutt, son, we full bred
You ain't my dog, trying to infiltrate my clique is you
I get wit you, handle that on a later note
We o'er-dose every day the death is so close
I'm trying to tell these cats, but I let them do they thing
Ready for the bad news 'til the phone ring
Son is dead, now I'm in way over my head seeking revenge, son
Bent, son, on your behalf trying to laugh

Check out the drill, dunn, conceal guns, play the hum
For real son's leanin' back checking out the action
On the benches, we drinkin' Xs
Yo twirl dat shit, while I spark this
Chocolate, burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz 'cause its time to bring the biz to kids
And blow all hell fire out ya' empire
Your livest wire couldn't make my Mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
I sit quiet wit' my head full of riot
Our buyers, it's clear for your ear to hear
I declared only live niggas rap this year
'96-I lost my dun, '97-It got worse
 fuck it
Somebody out the team, got to get murked
And sat down, you play the background when shots sound off
Flashin' back on how my mans is gone
K.B. forever in my memory
I spill some Henny then I keep it movin'

Yo, do our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this
Ain't nobody stoppin this, Rakim and Infamous
Rep the hood for you and yours, no doubt, crash the boards
And you don't really wanna go against the source

Surprise, open your eyes, peep the foulness, the wildness
It's bug, niggas thugs in the projects, you holiday thugs
Ease up all that illin' and grillin', get ya melon lit up
Y'all niggas is butt, you want me? I'm right in QB, what?
Where you find me at, sippin' Cognac from a cup
With my heat next to my nuts
Never afraid to pull it and bust
Slug rushes to your head like dust, but that wasn't enough
This one was kind of tough, he squeezed back
Better believe he no longer breathe, black
Fuckin' with these Queens cats
I got dreams, raisin' my little queen
And nobody gonna stop that
In fact, black, if you come at me, don't come sloppy
All my baby girl got is a papi
To guide her through this world of hatred
And I die to see that she make it
And die to let the next man take it, is you stupid?
Verse 4: Rakim
Yo, you wanna come test, son, it's massive stress
Penalties of death, pay your last respects
We harass your rep if you slept or half-step
We adapt to see what we can master next
After sex pass the bless for after effects
Relax through stress, do math and set, mad connects
Cash the check to get assets we blast Tecs
Dealing with the mental aspects in chess
So retreat your troops, if you dunns come to shoot
Get greeted by a twenty-one gun salute
I keep 'em leery of the deadly ""7 MC"" theory
Soon as they hear me, I release 
""Lyrics of Fury""
And quick to say a poem that ricochet in your dome
My clique made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone
So I can get the cheddar and be the better trend setter
The 18th Letter forever, what

Yo, do our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this
Ain't nobody stoppin this, Rakim and Infamous
Rep the hood for you and yours, no doubt, crash the boards
And you don't really wanna go against the source
Yo, do our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this

Here come the vultures, the Mobb-laced potent rap shit
Perhaps, kid, make it happen, start the flipping
You fucking comic, who you kidding?
My nigga's laughing, blood bathin', the world's greatest
In-famous crimes heinous
To interfere would be dangerous
Plain and simp', stand clear, save your strength
You couldn't go the length if you was coked up
Bombazee'd up, whatever the fuck
Who gives a fuck? You get fucked
My coalition specialize in collision
The clash of the cliques
The duel of the iron MAC spit
And leave ya half-split
You'll be missin' much more than a fraction
When it's time for action
Hit 'em while he man down, make that nigga backspin
Trapped up by New Yiddy madmen
We're blasting, you're collapsing
Heavily like my gold MAC-10
Get imprisoned with them raps they have you relapsing
You get casting the Mobb, deaf and assin
We face splashing, dope fake's ice-pick stabbing
He slow leakin', eternally bleedin' for speakin'
Outta place, niggas get placed back indecent
Live at the main event, may I present
And scream it out loud for any Squad that's Def
My Infamous Mobb, ya heart throb, hold ya breath
He's KO'd from dead-arm rights and hard lefts
Another satisfied consumer who got blessed
Single out ya army 'til there's no man left

Lay the fuck down!

Infamous cartel, visible evidence
We scarred well, associated team benevolent
Never hesitant, opposition get settled, hit with
Sharp shit that'll rip through
One hundred layers of Kevlar, sharp like the GemStar
Exiled, son, he get sent far
It's the foulest, QBC gat bust the loudest
But low profile, peep style, thirsty prowess
Catching court cases, pay for your legal aid
Son, that's money wasted, I ain't got time for that
Invest, though place on my best sold rap
On the strength from the ignorant cats
It'll be dead in a few....just like that
Couldn't bust his gat right (Yo, y'know what?)
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass
Homeroom, take that ass to class
But you cutting, ducking a reality blast
You catch a D-minus fucking with New York's finest
No conversation for them outsiders
Dick riders, connivers bomb ya camp
Leave no survivors, caught you off guard, got homicided
We analyzing, tell you up front, ain't no surprises
We take you down first round, give ya man pound

Let me start from the beginning at the top of the list
First of all, them tight niggas with that spaced-out shit
I stick a rocket up in they ass and give em a lift
My marvelous Mobb is tonic, intoxicant, beastly
Morphine raps, you get dope from N.O.Y.D
Shit fiending, now get your fix 'cause you need it
Fucking up your intravenous, the Infamous Mobb top secret
The only way you weaken this is if you peeking this
Sneak thieving niggas mischievous
Knowledging the God behind the scene on some snake shit
The vultures, water from their mouth but we can taste it
We just waiting with patience
Yo, dun, check the cross-examination, these niggas faking
So you can scream, you can fiend, you can dream for the bacon

It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like llello in a bill my feelings just get crushed
But thats why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics

And now his brother not giving a fuck
Little sister giving up the butt now, dun don't wet that
I want you to rest black, 'cause you can believe that Noyd gon' handle that
Cause when I get 'em, I'm gonna have 'em
Pull out the sweeper, and spray it at 'em
I'm no killer, you know me
But I'll be damned if I don't ride for my co-D
And then this OG, scold me, and told me, coldly
You keep it up and you will be dead like your homie
But I, gotta redeem, get this cream by any means
I never been clean
Nigga, my whole click got dirty
From the vials, to the trials and the bloodied up syrtie
Nigga you heard me, it's gangsta (and to the block)

Why'd you have to raise me this way?
You taught me how to survive the concrete

Why'd you have to raise me this way?
I'm surprised we alive today, today
For how long, who am I to say?
Forever you a part of me

Vision the canvas I paint a picture
Similar to Ernies Barnes, nigga
But mines is more ghetto more guns
More drugs, mostly thugs
All my dunns, their baby moms daughter and sons
Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at
If you look close you can see the bricks chipped off
Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off

And write shit that certainly'll move y'all niggas

From Red Hook, to QB, y'all know the routine
We need a movie to show how our life so ill
Every summer in the projects we partied on the benches
A few gallons of gin and Pepsi
Remember party balls (I remember that shit)
That was back in like '90
We used to roll oo-wees, now we stuff Dutches
Bing bust it, what's your discussion
Y'all niggas talk a lot of shit heard you on the tape frontin'
I fakes nothin', ya fuck around and push the wrong button
I dedicate my days to seein' you drip blood
Will always love 
Gambo
 and Scarface
Killa Black, no man can fill your shoes
Now what's bad news
It couldn't get no worse, so what y'all niggas know about the turmoil
What y'all know about the blood, soil, clothes and little hoes
And the legs of pants, slugs that crack the shin bone
The other shots blast through your left clavicle
Melt switch suits and paint the avenues

How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
Medium rare, raw? Havoc just over done it
And while you sittin' there whisperin', like a little girl
Fuck, waitin' around 'til the dutchie gets twirled
We going at you, not 'cause we want to but 'cause we have to
Revoke situation that you couldn't last through
If I can't have it all, then I don't want it at all
Off top serious dog, I'm out for the brawl
Battle the world, shit I kick'll dazzle your girl
Handle the bitch
Can't? Then take this referral
Hit 'em with the pink slip, get 'em bent to earl
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl
Hold it down like Saddam, you can't search my crib
Even with dirty worms I'ma still appear

How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?

Yo, yo, my pen is sick like a heroin addict, whenever Mega spits
I exhale preciseness, drug dealer ghetto shit
Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from measuring grams
Gun on my waist, in case I see son, who wetted my man
I be Gore-Texing to death
, rockin' ice with special effects
It's obvious that I was destined to rep
Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous conglomerates
Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit
Born official, my niggas that's gone I miss you
I shed a tear, see y'all niggas when I get there
Yo my dunn did six years and still didn't hit the strip
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers incomplete
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet
And I can relax with my Air Max, appearing on my feet
When I rhyme you enter my mind
Seein' niggas need the excellence
I represent is manifested in the beat
Respect this, like a Lexus Jeep
My technique, leaves my enemies stressed for weeks, vexed at me
Especially knowin' my destiny is near
They scared to death of me, they fear
To even question me, I serve 'em like I'm stretchin' keys, please

I've been out in the cold, hustling for so long
My hands numb, but bet I feel that paper in my palm
It's like ahh, shit it's on, time to go shopping
For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck looking cute, save that for the broad
It's the H-A-V-O-C, dump and reload
Knock-knock, answer that, I'm blasting through the peephole
Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those
But get locked and I'm slutting lady C.O.'s
And we the only niggas you know, that fuck they P.O.'s
They push our files to the top, you still on parole
We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
Too much dollars to fold, it's bulging out our jeans

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
[Verse 2: Havoc & 
Prodigy
]
Y'all like bitches – the chit-chattering
Stay not liking a nigga but giving dap to him
Hav' don't change for no chick, and they adapt to him
Never get cool with you niggas, I end up clapping 'em
Federal note fetish, you fuck with my niggas
Franklin and Grant, get your ass blammed with the quickness
Y'all niggas is finished, you overdosing the world
With that cute shit, it's time for this realness
And here I go again, letting the mac blow
Slugs bubble up in your stomach like lactose
I'mma date shorty, put it up in her backbone, for real
Put it on her like a track I rapped on, for real
Know what? We outlive labels, and distributors
We run laps around every artist on your payroll
Then hop up in a Range Rov', jet black with the black rims
Killing your bitch in her a-hole, uh-oh!

But losing ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
But losing ain't a option girl

Can’t Get Enough Of It,Hell On Earth,1996.0,"QBC
About to take over, your area!
Yo

Left to right protect the life, guard my castle
When goin' at you, take it to the gats if I have to
It's the hassle, jealous thugs I suppose squeeze
Turn that ass to Swiss cheese, leave permanent holes
And to them hoes, you know how it go, no dough
Cause they subject to wakin' with cash and go crazy
Yeah they bangin baby, Havoc representin' for them niggas
That don't trick, ladyless, just associates
Appropriate, no doubt, but bust it
I love this rap shit got me fillin' mad clips perhaps it's
Them fake rappers, but they damn good actors
From population, through the math I subtract them
You hear no laughter, QBC the thug factor
You niggas ain't worth the punch, back snatch ya
Pitbull attack ya, and half snap ya
Kodak moments I capture, like an escaped
Convict, Pearl Harbor, bomb shit
Handle B-I, on some calm shit

I can't get enough of it, the rough shit, grenade lyrics
My appearance is thug, rap slug ritual
For every dollar gotta nigga's blood chiseled, the slug sizzle
Pistol-whip tight, night monopoly
Four 380's in the prophecy, the bigger I got
Handle B-I, smoke a C-I, snuff a C-O
Can't You See, I'm the Total, vocals is low blow
Barely soldierable reinformed the man from Nahwan (Nahwan!)
Toe to toe complex the next expert, who's in control?
Episode, you can't control your fascination
Hell is the name, two guns that look the same
Frame of thought change, first we live then we abort
Cloth Polo Sport, catch a nigga on his sports
Talk back I'll leave ya jacked, rap format, I'm hostile
Wild out for snakeness equals foul
General G, blowin judges in the trial

Yo the NYC, M-O-B-B thug shit (and that's my shit!)
I can't get enough of it
Either fuck with it, or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent
When my cats attack you got your knot split, aiyyo
I can't get enough of it
Either fuck with it, or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent
When my cats attack you got your knot split
We out to win and that's it!
We out to win it like this!

It's like this kid, aiyyo
We shut it down like the Muse and blast like fresh tecs
Out the box, we outbox, get suplexed
Take notes nigga, best check the index
Look over anything that you might've missed
You overlooked the part with some unified terrorists
Pirates, straight off the ship, and mad starvin'
Anchored to land and now we runnin wild poundin'
On imbecile niggas who ain't got they feet grounded
Precise, astonishin' shots split ya skin's top
We sent pops, catch you from two blocks
Don't run up on you chargin', with hot shit, he felt it, alarmin'
Shockin', surprisin' shit, left you crawlin'
Dangerous, umm, and ready to rock
This man's hot, your flesh start to boilin' hot
Rhymes solid like a lead pipe, that bleeds your knot
Knot headed niggas get knocked out a lot
Kick down your chain-locked door, we raise spot
My clique got a deadbolt lock, you rather not Duke
Stormin' through the crowd, hard to see, comin' through
(Watch out, watch out, watch out, comin' through comin' through kid)
Spill my over-proof is drippin' from my temple
Lay on the wall and watch all y'all
You can't injure a ninja who crept and took fall
Surrounded by crime cats, time for tap jaws
Leave red stains on clothes, carpets and floors
Word up

Aiyyo we bang like the Tunnel and jam like broke gats
One hundred and oh, nigga go check the stats
QB, yeah that name hold weight and ring bells
All you niggas Shook and It Ain't Hard To Tell
Major clientele, the Infamous cartel
Catch a buck fifty, them stars we scar well
Hard luck, got gassed up and starstruck
Then got stuck in one stroke, the Mobb clutch
Laid up, sippin' all types of shit, get ya chick bent
Talk the bitch to death til there's no info left
Homicidal clepto, like the lye leaf I'm petrol
Regulate the Metropolitan, niggas gettin' bodied in
In the lobby-in, lock the door it ain't safe, kid
Take it how you take it, grab a hold and embrace it

Yo, however do u want, however do you need P
My Mobb bring it back to life, back to reality
You walk a fine line playin wit mine, the greatest story ever told in rhyme
We climax in ninety-five, wit demo raw raps is knives
To skin all ya'll cats alive
Take your time don't rush the clock, Infamous rock for good now
Pass like my duns on lock holdin the pot down slow
But assuringly, spoon-feeding these
Starvin ass heads catchin shakes, feenishly
I ball in this, word assortin this, probably recording this
Of course kids keepin they sights upon this
Exclusiveness, like some new type of kicks
We got them things fixed, passed the wrong man in my click
You get charged wit intent to kick that bullshhh
Welcome to the ledge of this whole shhh
Chorus 
Yo, we the men for the operation
You know the M-O, B-B's, warrior style, rare species
Catch us on your block , on your wide-screen tv's
From Jones Beach to over-seas from over there
It's right back to the beats, longevity so all the great-grandseeds eat

Yo, for my QBC duns, it's all real hold it down
You bust yours, we bust ours and stand on firm ground
Pass the dutchie while I, handle the Henny thinkin
You never catch me sleepin, stay on top of this properly
I know they watchin me, if not they probably waitin for a downfall
Scheming on my property, we got the remedy
Let em get a little cold, let em smell the tree smoke
Hit em where we blow and don't let nobody know
The snakes in the grass, you gotta watch where you move
Son, shots get loaded, don't ever run wit the crowd son
Stick and move, you hear me?
And that's the way we rock it, the only way to live
If you really think about it
Every move is humble wit precision, careful thought decisions
And my whole cli-tique the same vision
41st till I dearly depart, till then I'll be somewhere gettin bent up in a den
Sippin gin, while you shook cats just pretend to be something
That your not and that's not good my friend
On a personal, I ain't even feelin you cats
Don't even acknowledge the fact that you weak raps
We bust gats at, on the reg laughed at
Son you know we passed that, get em outta here, cuz you could have that

Four pounds, stumbled off grounds
Fire off many a rounds, I heard return fire 3% of the time
Your dogs was wives actin like girls, get feminine when handlin guns
You could run or take the window, son
Or feel this hot one, we rip all strifes dun dun
Without a fight son
, we keep the house dope like piefienies
We twist and pop Henny, gettin wet on the daily, and
Peers get chilly, turnin macks fully
Now they bandin, court rehanded and got remanded, faught
A one to three 
degree from V-O-P and N-C-C-V
And send me up a hub to a state facilities
What could I do but sneak, burn a tree, or tobacco leaf
Or wait until my time served and get released
Cool, back on the streets I seen some old drama
I still hold heat to send your ass straight to trauma
These kids started to 
drilling
 like they ready and willing
I gave em exactly no time to switch feelings
Pulled out, to my man, look out
Commits to warfare, and rock these to sleep like this here
Seventy-two like as if I was back on the top
Hours of thinkin about how I'mma tip they ass up out the basket
Belligerent glass heads, I'm bashing
No knowledge of the man nor his action
Class now is in session, ""Soldiers boys, today's aim is: Never show your heat
And don't flame it""
You playin life, wit a man who lives by the sword
And dies naturally against all karma and laws
What, speed on and get peed on

Peer Pressure,Juvenile Hell,1993.0,"The pressure... (you gotta find a way to deal with)
Dealin' with the peer pressure

As a young black teen, everyday I, deal
With the pressure and mixed up is how I feel
I walk the streets with a fuck you attitude
And when it comes to my peoples, you ain't half as rude
Follow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick
Now I'm smokin' buddha philly blunt style
A frustrated and confused young juvenile
King of the project blues so I choose
To take a piece of the action
But my sober state of mind won't let it happen
So, 24/7 is the number one stresser
Dealin' with the peer pressure


Most don't understand how it is
In the world of today growin' up as a young black teen
I used to dream, of bein' a architect
Easier said than done, believe me it's hard to get
Out of the projects, without forgettin' where you came from
My parents told me from day one
Finish school and avoid all obstacles
But my environment makes it so impossible
For instance, build a strong social life
Without messin' up, still tryin' to live right
Like in junior high, I used to wonder why
Certain females went out with certain guys

Then one day, it all dawned on me, yo
You gotta be down and have it goin' on, see?
I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team, huh
Now I'm gettin' steamed
Gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers
So now I'm sippin' on beers
Buyin' new gear, nuthin' but the best
Forget Levi's, strictly Polo and Guess
But how would I make the cash?
It gotta be easy and it gotta be fast
Thinkin' to myself ""Does that make me lesser?""
Just, dealin' with the peer pressure


Around my way there's a kid that most don't understand
How he lives, is it negative or positive?
He has a grade A average
But when he's on the streets with his friends, he's a savage
A freshman of high school, daily attendant
He never got in trouble, never did he get suspended
Good little Kenny, who would believe?
He dropped out of school to start to smoke weed
I saw the signs but I didn't pay attention
Because he got offended every time that I would mention
The drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades
And sleepin' in class, laid back with his black shades
Nowadays, you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways
With his crew, findin' more ways
To break out of school and hit the block and get buckwild
Stay out of the way of a mad child
'Cause he's a product of hell
Kenny never fell but he's gonna fall overall
So, let's take a trip to the ghetto
Where Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man, so
He pulled the trigger and the suicide note read:
""I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead
And no more do I have to feel lesser
Or deal with the peer pressure""",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-peer-pressure-lyrics

I can see you back there, yeah (whattup?)
Yo

The Mobb'll spit that shit, rip that bitch, leave it loose
Take shit back to trip who fat Goose
Queensbridge representative, ghetto entrepeneur, stay on tour
Dick-riders wanna get abortions
The same law, same day contract, different clause
Don't run red lights, I never caught the blue balls
Gold medalist spit, doin' this ever since
Third time felon, nigga, who you tellin'?

Cause we allustrious, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust, if you fuck with us
It's a must we bust, and if you stand with us
Nine times out of ten son you might get bucked
Cause we allustrious, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust, if you fuck with us
It's a must we bust, and if you stand with us

P holds the pen tightly, explode nightly
I count on one finger all y'all rap niggas that excite me
Y'all niggas is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggas is so bald they might be
Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
With the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggas is the rap jesters
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now
Move over bacon, time for some'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, 
how dare you entertain the thought
That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk, this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin' you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
But it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it

Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
It's a must we burst ours first
Nigga we Infamous, ashes to ashes 'til death do us
And y'all weak to us
If you stand amongst us, prepare for the worst
And it's a must we burst ours first, nigga

Yo.. crack the Henny bottle while I drop this jewel on your dome
My shit'll touch home, straight to the core you ain't alone
Play the unknown type dunn, mysterious stars
Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin' his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
In formation pack the lead up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop 'em in they tracks, goin at 'em when you send 'em
Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key

Dunn these niggas is actresses
And they tryin' to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin' out on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin' elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin' the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin' the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands colossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin' to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked dunn

It's that war shit
And you know what dun

It makes you sick to hear the Mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns heads bop to this
We stand out like a terrace
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like Pelé
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground that nigga like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

It be the guns, money, pussy, cars, drugs, jewels, clothes
Brawls, killings, boroughs, buildings, disease, stress, in these ,N.Y.C

Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you letting niggas go
So you can lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit
Have you wilding out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it


Taste test this Military shit
Bitches love this
They mans wanna dub this
Thugness it ain't easy to find
Shit like mine I'm a rare species
You's a dime a gross
That's a dozen heast the least
Keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coats
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons...a permanent flesh your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper
With all pleasure
Lift his feet up
Pick your heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury

When I feel like getting bent
Yo don't fuck with it dun
I'mma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog
Never to return I guess they heard God's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-pounding shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that
Pull out I try to grab that
Caught one nigga like Mahadat


Tonight we gon' get this party early
So let's get it right",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-adrenaline-lyrics
I’m Going Out,Murda Muzik,1999.0,"Going out nigga
Big guns and sharp knifes
Revolvers cause automatics jam at the wrong time(I'm going out)
Like fights with the brass knuckles
Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it(I'm going out)
Like I ain't got nothing to live
Like as if u had guns to my kids fuck it (going all out)

Yo you know the type that style and shit that rise my dick
Pop me a nigga quicker than police
Leave more wombs than a whole room full of chicks
You running while I'm gunning cause you a bitch
I heard niggas talking like they goinng to dead mines
I got enough guns we can make the headlines
I'm from a place where the realeast niggas get murdered
And the illest niggas try to avoid it
But can't call it
It's a cold world bundle up
Keep your heat on at all times
And never freeze up
And your eyes blink you could catch a hole in your tank
Have you leaking all over the place
Watch how you speak
And watch how you move through the streets
I got a mob with niggas with heat
We liable to squeeze 'fore we think
Breath 'fore is too late
Uph you fucked up and got laid to sleep

(I'm going out)
With big guns and sharp knifes
Revolvers cause automatics jam at the wrong time(I'm going out)
Like fights with the brass knuckles
Swinging belts catching niggas with the buckle now fuck it(I'm going out)
Like I ain't got nothing to live
Like as if you had guns at my kids fuck it (going all out)
For the big checks and large faces mansions
And my duns would do the same for me

I'm going out like a nigga that ain't never have nothing
Fuck it I ain't frontin'
If I want to know I got to go out like a navy seal
Label me ill you sling thrills
Meet you on top of the hills screaming dollar bill
Going out like a nigga you just smacked
His moms in the cut plotting patient and calm
Putting on everything that I love and stand for
Getting bent up in the pub 'till five in the morn
Going out like a nigga with six days to live
And like a single parents raising a kid now that's a bid
Going out like a nigga with shit touching his rib
You got more than nesessary dun a nigga went dead
Going out for my niggas see this gat in my hand
You better back the fuck up what part didn't you understand
Have a nine aimed straight at your thyroid glands
Must've not been really your men them niggas that ran (I'm going out)


We do it well, clip niggas like nails
Catch cases, skip bails
I lie before I ti-dell, die in a ci-del
Pop guns with the shi-dell, fuck a bitch 'til she yi-zell
Rap style Smoother than CL, in the K on the DL
Line for line you can detail, choked more niggas than Sprewell
Rap style P.L.O., watch me blow like tornadoes
Clear the block out with just an echo
Trust me niggas don't want me see let go
Niggas don't want to see the tech blow
Watch me move the crowd like techno music nigga
When it come to murder you know we do it for the cause
Fuck relying on the law, ain't worth dying for
I rather die fucking raw
Or walking on a mine in the cold war
My dogs got my shoulders with fatigued up machine guns
All my niggas soldiers
With big grenades throw them in your rover
Send Prodigy to check the scence when it's over
Niggas animals coming back for leftovers (all out nigga)


I'm going out
I'm going out
I'm going out",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-im-going-out-lyrics

Yo, as I look to the sky and ask God why he put me here
I know why {*GOD*} to have you cowards shook {*DAMN*} runnin with fear
See that glare in my eyes and my focus clear (uh-huh)
I'm that head coach, benchin you rookies and fake players
Only spit, collector's edition shit
So in a few years it'll be ten times what you spent
When niggas claim they movin that weight, knowin they lyin
My niggas put more drugs on the block than Pfizer
All you niggas on the dick, little secret admirers
Let it out... baby girl, don't be ashamed
When you shorty run the choo-choo train
Have her sippin the deuce-deuce dame, Mobb and the group remains
From the stain I was down for the game
Never went against grain, and never let a bitch borrow my chain
From day one, to the micro-pain
Up inside these veins is dat real nigga, ain't shit changed

Dem niggas shook, cause ain't no such thing as halfway gangstas
Nigga got bumped and ain't look
Niggas shook, cause ain't no such thing as halfway gangstas
Nigga got bumped and ain't look
Niggas caught up in the gliss' and the glamour
And then got' sleep with the hammer, let somebody tell you different
And that ass will, die for (?)poor grammar(?)
Fuck around if you wanna, I don't think you coward heart got the stamina

I had (?)Claudette all tense(?), pussy sore for days
I'd rather, beat my dick than go the R. Kelly way
I'd take Felice for nine and a half weeks
Fill it back, pourin Henny on her ass cheeks
I fucked Missy in that Lamborghini
Give Foxy the ecstasy without the pill, see me
I give Alicia Keys quickie while she on tour
Nuttin' but +Gangsta Love+, then I take a flight home
I told Lice' she need to bark at me
So I can, kill her with the collar and the leash
Shit I got plans, I need to get in touch with Stacie Dash
Cause she doesn't have a clue what she missin over here
Scratch Jenny Lo' itch, whenever Ben ain't there
I have Whitney doin lines off my dick, you hear?
Throw Trina big fattie in a wheelchair, fuck dreamin
P and them is doin this for real

It's on son

Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son, extra cash just for more guns
Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son, extra cash just for more guns

Yo, Ty Nitty, air-force one's call up my dunns
Got more niggas like seeds on sesame buns
Caught a body on the run
You don't want none, lump some
Extort niggas for they lump sum, no doubt
Proceed, where that weed indeed?
Havoc laced the track razor sharp, you bleed

My whole mission, like a platoon take position
Ain't going in if my clique can't get in
That's word to mines, have you stressed like jail time
Get that loot up, no doubt I bail mines
Easy access, shorty straight up hit the mattress
Have you role-playing just like an actress
My tactics leaving niggas stuck doing back flips
I black out, take it to the gats, fuck this rap shit
Let my niggas shine, rate my rhymes like a dime

Swollen bullet wound head ass niggas
Yo, who's the one to be made into example?
Nigga, you pop shit with the wrong guys this time
What? My Mobb will get on top ya, topple ya
Like a fall guy you fell down clown
First the four-pound sound, my eighty-six style now
Ten years later still holding firm ground
Nigga P thugly, enter the ring with something
For anyone who wanna play gun, what up G?
I clap you, stop you in your tracks, how bout that?
Now analyze these cats, a live nigga rap
You seen strapped, came outside all hype with gats
Got juiced up, now bishop think he thugging it black pimp
Let's rap a taste, you get your little head pinched off
Brooklyn touched you then left you for Queens to finish off
Fuck a  Keith Murray and his whole clique
Yeah, you snuffed me in front of the cops, that bullshit
Told you come around the corner, no police and no witnesses
Little to your knowledge, you almost got shot
But that's aight though, I'ma catch your ass again
You fuckin immigrant  for two cent
My Mobb running shit, you fucking Carlton Ave coward
The forecast call for grey skies and gun showers
 x2
Cause in the long run we could be on son
It's on son, extra cash just for more guns

What? What? Nigga knock your man out boy
Knock him out cold boy
Like a motherfucker boy

We gon' be here all night like a motherfucker
Infamous forever

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Boom Goes the Cannon...,Hamildrops,2018.0,"Uh
Yeah

Boom! goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray
How can we keep leading if the people keep retreating?
Nah, boom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here
Boom! goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop
Now we the real leaders, opposition retreats when
Boom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' take the war and run them outta here

Check it out
That's my right hand man, we like the Bobbsey Twins
You got my back, I got your back when the sass begins
We grew up in the slums, broke bread together
When worse came to worse, rolled out the weather
Had faith, knew it couldn't be this bad forever
And once the sun shined, it could only get better
Birds of a feather, we on the same page
Since high school  whatever came our way
Your kids is my kids, vice-versa
You ain't ask who the beef with, only where the burner
Never blink a eye, you'll back down just to hold the fort down
From Q.B. to Strong Isle, my soldiers running wild, we wildin'
Courtesy of projects houses
And though you not here, you lookin' down on me smiling
We took a oath to keep the name afloat
We Infamous forever, homie, the ultimate G.O.A.T.s

Boom! goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray
How can we keep leading if the people keep retreating?
Nah, boom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here
Boom! goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop
Now we the real leaders, opposition retreats when
Boom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' take the war and run them outta here

Yeah, yeah
We are at war, no man is safe, you can't hide forever
Die on the battlefield to rise up and take power
It's 32,000 troops in New York harbor
We outgunned, outmanned, and outnumbered
It's 32,000 troops in New York harbor
We outplanned, out our mind pushing forward
We a powder keg about to explode
Wish we had a man like Hamilton to lighten the load
Send the word, get 'em
He want to fight, he got the hunger
Yeah, I was just like him when I was younger, uh
Head full of fantasies of dying like a martyr, but look
Dying is easy, young man, livin' is harder
It's gon' be pools of blood in New York Harbor
Rah! Gunfire and cannonballs, it's on, son
Pools of blood in New York Harbor
Rah! Willin' to die in Revolutionary War, dunn

Boom! goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray
How can we keep leading if the people keep retreating?
Nah, boom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear
We gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here
Boom! goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop
Now we the real leaders, opposition retreats when

Let a Ho Be a Ho,Murda Muzik,1999.0,"No matter what you think
A ho gonna be a ho
And a nigga definitely gonna be a nigga
Cuz I'm a nigga
M, O, double B
I don't know why they wanna trouble me
Is it because they bitch be suckin me
Or just mad cause they shitted wit the family
We be bubbling, up in the Navigator huddlin
While you frontin in that rental, cuddling
With that weak ass bitch, damn right she snitch
And if I had in my misdt, she'd be biting shit
Hook 2X:
Cause a ho gonna be a ho
A nigga gonna be a nigga
No matter what the fuck you think
Got cash in my escrow, never gonna let it go
(Hell mothfuckin no!)
Chillin at the crib layin in my boxers
While shorty got bent spittin tha latest gossip
Didn't want to hear it in the middle cut her off
Lit a stog, smacked her ass, grabbed her by the draws
Bugged in the head but her looks turned me on
She tried to turn me on with edible thongs
Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin my songs
From Queens to get to her crib didn't take long
Said she had a man but was locked up in Attica
Freak off with the VCR to my camera
After that shit that happened to 2Pac
Yell rape? Show 'em the tape jus playin my part
Opposed to being on tape but the G that I ran
Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand
When I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam
Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my mans

Crawlin,Infamy,2001.0,"Without a doubt, you gonna hear that thing clap
Dog I take shit to heart cause I was born like that
I only got my word as a man when I give
When I say I'm going at you it's a given when I spit it
So niggas talk out the ass amongst those who live it
So niggas get money bounce from the hood you shitted
So bitches fuck niggas, they man best dog
Over that now you got some nigga leaking on the floor
You gotta watch those broads
To die over that is totally against the grain and against street laws
I respect paper and every minute thats spent gettin that shit
So my little dunn could be set
And what I feal about a nigga thats trying to pose threats
Never write it out if you can't cash that check
Dog I know about death you ain't sayin nuttin slick
Empty out on that fool cliq cliq, cliq cliq
Havoc: Hook x2
So keep movin, You better keep walkin
The nine will have them crawlin, crawlin
Clinging for life

Nigga how you want it nigga, cause you about to get served
Matter of fact nigga, you about to get your shit burned
Punk motherfucker, female ass nigga
The homo rapper, 
H to the you know
Come on man I ain't gotta spell it out for you
You know how to tell time you know my gun boil
I set it off on your bitch ass, dont forget that
And your retaliation was weak, baby pictures
Dunn I'll take you out in the street and spank you bitch
Ain't no point going at ""P"" you run into bricks
How you not gonna show face after that stunt
At rap's only awards and you ain't show up
You scared and you butt, you are now being crushed
By these black Mobb gangstas you niggas is done
I suggest that you pack up and take it to go
Cause everything is not cool and you niggas should know
Havoc: Hook
So keep movin, You better keep walkin
The nine will have them crawlin, crawlin
Clinging for life

How it feel when that steel hit the grill huh
For real, for real shit be that real son
The grimy endulge in nothing but gangsterness
That ice is lookin major on your wrist
Is you ready to die like a man for it
Or pass it right over, fall back and get extorted
Like a camcorder every move is recorded
Keep them hands so I see them
Every thought I can read 'em!

Ya'll some ho ass niggas, I'll slap days out you
You was raised off our shit we made rappers
Bitch ass nigga
I'll buck the fuck out that nigga
And peel that fruit, kill that fool
'88, is you crazy?!
That's when I was fuckin Sophie and you was pumpin for poison!
My nigga Killa Dang woulda spit in your face

Man I want niggas to hear this shit right here
Knahmsayin? Cause these niggas be forgettin son
Knahmsayin? .. Can't blame niggas doe (we here son)
Y'know? Truth always reveal itself though
That's what we here for
But umm.. we gon' take this little intermission
To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know?
(Let me, let me here something then)
It's like this Dunn

Infamous til the name wear out
Time and again without doubt
I take the murder one route
Why clowns pulled out and copped out
Poppin they, little heads out they hole
Stickin they chest out, actin like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin this since we was kids
And all you other niggas gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggas got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a tru to life nigga like P
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like anigga livin street life
How to chase down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga til he throw up
Straighten up there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And I'mma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin
Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck wit the God
P wit a capital ""P""
And don't ever in your life try to rock wit me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top
I, splash the half ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long
My shit came out and you got escorted to the door
You just a fuckin clown here to entertain us all
I bring the gravity Dunn you're gonna fall
Anytime y'all niggas wanna mic brawl
Don't forget to me it's bloodsport bring your dogs
Nigga

And if you in a situation, just be patient
Give me a minute and I'll be there with no hesitation
And all them bitches that you hittin we done ran through that
Plus dissed them, that's why they can't stand our raps
As for you couldn't give a fuck on how you feel
Never allowed, and break em up like a whack album
Go against to get punished, fuck you
Take it out on who run wit, then touch you
Ain't no room for the both of us you pop too much shit
I just handle shit and put a clamp, on them loose lips
I sink em like the Titanic, you be deep in some shit
I didn't stutter can't hear nigga read my lips
Who you runnin wit - shit you won't knock this click
You just frontin wit imaginary pies you flip
Aiyyo P my mind and yours put together's like a pack wild pirahnas
Carnivores it's me thirstin
It only worsen, you cats'll get the closed curtain
While your catch me on your networkin, you dick jerkin
Your future's uncertain - get a grip close your mouth
Cause you know them shits sink ships
It's foul - tryin to go against the morale
Move the crowd do my thing leave your ears aroused

All A Dream,The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014.0,"Uh, jumped up from sleep, soaked in sweat
Heart beatin' crazy from a dream I had
We was doing it up, cash flowin'
I know you hear me, nigga, but you not knowin'
Champagne bottles and honeys floatin' in the pool
So much poppin', the jacuzzi was full
Mad hoes for the bro
And everybody rollin' up, we could all smoke
Pure Molly, good golly, that turned up the whole party a few notches
Hold up, it's all comin' back now
Cocaine buffet, mini mountains
 of that pretty white girl
The DJ played all the right songs, we was all faded
Bottles on the house, half naked broads on the couch
Gettin' poked up, warmin' up

Then I woke up and I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

I had a dream I didn't even go get my Grammy
I was smokin' and fuckin' bitches in Miami
I had a dream that Biggie told me that I was nice
Then I woke up and realized it was real life
Four-fifth on my hip, bottles pop
Weed in the air, these hatin' niggas still on my dick
I had a dream that my niggas came home
Celebratin' life, then I woke up, my shit was blown
Tragic, I had a dream I had floor seats
In L.A. watchin' Bird and Magic
Exotic cars, money off-shore
Good weed, my niggas with me on tour

Then I woke up and I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

Coke on the scale, money for the bail
Lookin' is the rear view, feds on the tail
Used to mix E&J with Ginger Ale
Sold crack when my moms drank pink champale
Now I'm in Anguilla on a ship that sails
Out the St. Maarten, got them bricks in them mail
I don't play with the money 'cause the bread get stale
Rather sleep in a box 'fore I sit in a cell
Raisin' a wine glass, spliff in the air
I'm a gangsta, shoot me in the head if I tell
Kingpin, rap nigga dreams at twelve
Was it all a dream or could I see that well?

It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

Last night watched TV but it watched me
Know what that mean, motherfucker fell asleep
Then I fell into a dream, it was so real
I was out in Vegas, blew about a half mil
Rode the strip, Rodeo we was club hoppin'
Finger poppin', had drugs droppin'
Hangover three, had bottles non-stoppin'
Top of her lungs, ""World is ours!"" need a lozenge
In the Luxor caused the up-roar
Celebration time lift up your cups for
If it ain't us, who the fuck you come for?
Jumped on the G5s, back to the East Coast
Rich ass nigga still keepin' the heat close
Landed, bitches on deck to deepthroat
To scavenge for liquor and c-notes
They woke up to a bed full of freak shows

And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream

I had a dream that my first contract was a good one
When I get in I'ma let the whole hood come
Visualizin' all the things that could come
I did a lot of bad shit, I'm the good son
Everything paid for, we don't lease shit
My niggas still wit' me, that's G-shit
Four chandeliers, Master P shit
In the middle of the ocean, sea sick
Gorgeous, 
top of the Forbes list
No such as thing as, 'I can't afford this'
Pinky ring, 
sky dweller, iced out Choca
Money talks so I spoke up, then I woke up

And I was still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still livin' it
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Woke up and I'm still gettin' it
It was all a dream
And I was still livin' it

The Money,The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014.0,"(Get down, keep wildin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Leavin' permanent scars, like getting splashed on the island)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Gimme yours, or get your manhood taken)
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money
(Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good lookin')
Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money

Hey yo' what you wanna do with that black deuce-deuce
Hit you up, take that cash you ain't slug-proof dude
Takin' yours to survive, it's only matter of time
I'm snatchin', livin' grimy, runnin', never look back
The root of evil got me acting like that
Life ain't a game, the streets is mortal combat
I wasn't blessed with the silver spoon
Since my born, I was doomed, confined to one room
Now you a customer
Copping from natural born hustlas (that's what he thought kid)
Stupid son, he get extorted

Open your eyes, get wise, and look alive, pay attention
I'm manifestin', my slugs be leavin' niggas guessin'
You tried to graduate, but didn't know enough lessons
Time is of the essence, and yours is runnin' out fast
You won't last, livin' out your life like that
You shoulda got down with my crew, slingin' cracks international
But instead, you wanna merge with the rivals
And moves like that could end up homicidal
You suicidal, and I'm (alive on arrival)
Play the drug game with precision, and never with division
I'm tryna' see addition, food to fill my kitchen
Some faggot niggas snitchin' givin info
We'll do a drive by, in a stolen black Pinto
With tinted windows, bullets will flurry through your system
Your man ran, lucky for him, because we missed him
Catch him on the rebound, but see now
I'm tryna make this money and you tryna stop me, what's it gonna be now
You stand up to my crew and get laid down
On the ground with the big four pound
You hear the sound on the other side of town
Where caps get peeled, break you off, love, love
Give you somethin' to feel

Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money

Stop smilin', be still don't nothin' move but the money

You don't have to tell me twice
I know when to chill when I have to
But if I have to, I'll still clap you
I'll crack through your fortress, you couldn't hold it down
So you lost it, no crew could withstand the forces
Never second guess me, just bless me
Stop smilin', bodies stackin', dead presidents piled in
We wildin', lifted, terror three sixes
They got a petition, for my conviction
Rise to the occasion when it's time for blazin'
On the 41st side niggas is ravin'
For drama, we can handle it, it ain't nothin cause we used to it
It’s all good, the 'hood we ran through it
Since young, it used to be candy, but now it's guns
Stickin niggas son, my job ain’t done

You a Shooter,Get Rich Or Die Tryin’: Music From & Inspired by the Motion Picture,2005.0,"If youse a shooter then shoot nigga, I'm doin my thang
If you seen-a, my nina, you seen it go bang
That shit they do in your hood, they do it in mine mayne
I put a hole in a nigga, I ain't motherfuckin playin

You niggas ain't nuttin but clown killers for real
I'm down with the Unit, for the Gorillas for real
Go bananas if you want, ooh ooh, you gettin peeled
Y'all shoot for the shoot, we do this for real
Clap me's a motherfucker, make more mills
Cash me a check, to cop more wheels
Shorty you a bad bitch and good-ass steel
Now, I hop up on the dillz and smeared that lip gloss
Me and P sharin bitches like we switch Porsche
My hammer navigate beef, Hummer don't get lost
Boy, that Desert Eagle have that whole shit ripped off
Yeah - we get that gwop, cause we make
Shit that pop heavy rotation, your shit flop
Won't stop 'til we get, to that top
If the gun too far then you will get oxed
Y'all niggas ain't real y'all just talk a lot


If you a killer then kill somethin, you talkin all day
Frontin, killin nuttin, you niggas is real gay
See me shinin, mad diamonds, now what can I say
I'm a mega star, never thought it'd be this way
Niggas fightin for the bottom, I feel your pain
I'm at the top and I'm never comin back again
Except for when I come to scoop lil' shorty good brains
Out the hood, you see me in yo' hood don't play
I open up yo' head, and expose yo' brain
It's not a joke or a game, and I ain't tryin
To advance my rap lines, please believe what I say
I'm a Mobb nigga, nigga I do this all day
Hit the weed hit the gas on the Lamb' to skate
See me comin through the club, get out of my way

We Don’t Love Them Hoes,The Infamous Archives,2007.0,"You know Sometimes people can be awfully cruel
If you happen to care for somebody more than yourself
They consider you a fool
They mistake love for weakness and play on your mind
And at your expense they amuse themself just to pass the time

Yea, uh-huh, we don't love them, we don't love 'em
Eh-huh, eh-huh, we don't love 'em, yea, yo

Uh-huh, yea
Me and shorty in the back seat chiefin' on ganja leaf
She ain't inspired cheek cause her man is weak
He make it real easy for me to get her for free
She real use to the bullshit that he be speakin'
She's not use to - havin' that pussy ho beatin'
The bitch don't want to feel love, she want to feel sleazy
Bitch wanna have fun, yo ass is dough
That's why she ride with us to all the weekend shows
When I have first met the ho, she was real timid
She ain't know if it was aiight for her to live it
DAMN! look at her now, with many Pastel, Polo skirts
You see it all when she sit down
She keep it real easy for me to be in and out
All I gotta do is open 'em legs and bang it out
Without the struggle, or gettin' them panties off
Fuck her like I'm tryin' to kill her
Then I tell her ""get lost""

Love them hoes, we don't love them (Nope)
Love them hoes, we don't love them (Nope)
Love them hoes, we don't love them (No)

Damn! baby, how you call yourself a Pimp?
Let, let me understand somethin'
How you gon' be a Pimp, and get Pimped
That shit don't make sense to me man
You lettin' them bitches all up on your pocket man
You should be ashamed of yourself

Some think it's cool in the game and handcuff a bro', homey you wrong
Fuck you think she walk around with the matchin' pair of thongs
Tooth brush and the purse, the ho works
Shorty gained at your cribs, she at work
Master of the toe curl, shorty got it down to a science
Placin' body enough to start, damn right
Nigga like me just bang her out, and bangin' her friend
Soon enough it'll be a family event
Know the hipno', havin' them bent, sneakin' up
You ain't the only one beatin' her up
Real reason why she fucks with you cause you be lightin' her up
To her it's like paper trainin' to puff
Do she suck you?, fuck you?, make you feel like a man?
You gettin' that good lovin' and bitin' your own hand
Yo you just another fool, hopeless, tryin' to lock her
She got your ass comin' out the pockets uh?

Ay Ma, how you doin'?
Still, what you doin'?
True, chillin', you know me up in the studio doin' my thing
Yea, yea, you need what?, what the fuck you talkin' about
You need some, you better ask your baby father for that shit
You crazy, damn baby

Get It Forever,Black Cocaine,2011.0,"Niggas know, and if they don't
I shoot 'em in the head, whatever rock his fucking boat
Niggas in my face, you better leave before you can't
I lick shots like stamps, no FedEx
I'm hot, check the critics, call the paramedics
Your man was talking reckless so you know he had to get it
Me and money's magnetic, and you the polar opposite
Come through, bitch start dropping it, getting low
I don't gotta trick, the only Magic I know
Wore the number 32 and retired some time ago
So check the liner notes and miss me with the bullshit
Miss me with it or get hit with a full clip
I'm back on it, you could bet your ass on it
I'm so sure that I could put my fucking last on it
And if I didn't sell it then you know I rapped on it
Beat so ugly, gotta put a fucking mask on it

We get it forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never
We get it forever
We do this forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never

Looking through my eyes' view I see nothing but
Success for us, non-stop nothing but
Long money, long jab I stretch
Wrap around the Earth, 80 times 10
Warm breezes and Barbado' nights
Living sweet, yeah, but it's a cold life
You know we strapped in, best you buckle up
I did my little bit of years, yeah, what's up, what's up
Dare a nigga trouble us, make my niggas risk all of this
Infamous good shit, so quick
I'll be back inside the cage, my rage is unchanged
For this change, yeah, this bank, for Hav' is worth the pain
Change and pinky rings, estates for the kings
A Queens-bred gentlemen, she know how we bang
You tamper with this plush lifestyle, may you lay
In a hole 'til you ferment and bones decay

We get it forever
We do this forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never
We get it forever
We do this forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never

We come from where murders occur often on late nights
Niggas is high and they eyes be red as two brakelights
Medical marijuana, Henny bottles, and Grey Goose
Semis and shotties on deck, everybody's face screwed
But you know this already, my hood the coldest and deadly
Soldiers is ready, I am boastful, forgive me
Bitches talking to cops, cry when they nigga get washed
Beef could've been squashed, go finish that shit that you start
No clip in your Glock, you ain't prepared to fire
We call that riding with no air in your tire
You're flattened, it's a pattern after scrapping
What usually happen, death on arrival
Survival of the Fittest, ain't nothing like that Queensbridge shit
Y'all niggas finished, your only chances are diminished
And we don't need no fucking witness
Ain't what you know, it's what you live and we live it

We get it forever
We do this forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never
We get it forever
We do this forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-get-it-forever-lyrics

Front on this and get dissed

Hey yo I'm takin it Uptown, and niggas know my name
Little shorty insane, so feel the pain
And the wrath of the five foot murder
I'm goin' out baby uzi, style
Catchin' bodies like I hit skins
The hostile juvenile, fuck what you heard
More four-five, motherfucker die
My crew is live and real with a street deal
Automatic causin havoc when I hit
I flip and rip shop I'm on some homicidal shit
Little nigga loco, catchin' bodies on a solo
Props for killin cops I'm hellbound
I'm on a motherfuckin' mission, I'm goin at it
You want a freestyle kid I'm wilder than the penile
Back up off me, give me room to breathe
And you takin' up my spot? Nigga, please
I'm as bad as they come, there ain't nuttin' good
Used to be a gentleman but you can call me hood
Matter fact, fuck that kid, you know my name
Peace I'm Audi, me and my motherfuckin' crew

Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and

Ah one two, microphone check, who's next?
The five foot three, time to catch wreck
Set the situation motivate your mind
I'mma, step ahead and not a step behind
Bass now come again, checkin' for the little lyrical
Dark skinned dawn and chat be milky like cereal
Poof I make you move when I move I bet I make you
Buck I make you bugged as I kick the mega flavor
So I'm the kid just slippin' the slang
What's my name, what's my motherfuckin' name?
Fight, I make a fight motherfuckin' buckwild
Shootin' niggas up like it's goin out of style
So rusty bitches sharpen up your blades
Load up the clip, take a sip, what's the flav
I roll the streets at midnight, the little terror
Huh, I get better by the letter
A true breed, head to juvenile once more
A twenty bag of funk, shall I say more?
A real lil nigga with real motherfuckin skills
Far from weak, so get off the fuckin' deals
Do the do cause I'mma do mines too
Just chillin with my crew, peep the flavor

Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed

Check it
My man hav' got my back with the tec 20
To shoot 'em up if the niggas get funny
My shit is real, I had to pioneer in this
Around the way, all the fake niggas fear this
Paragraphs bust your membrane
On and on I bust through like teflon
The Little P, is not to be stepped upon
And if you think so kid then you're dead wrong
Little, far from big, yo a type small kid
P, I represent the brothers from Queensbridge
To make a long rhyme short I smoke weed
Sip a forty, yo, fuck the court
So bad they tried to lock me in a group home
Prodigy's hard but fuck it I can rip a smooth tone
I catch wreck with the Einstein's intellect
And get stupid like a Stimulated Dummies mix
Feel the wrath, feel the aftermath
Even if you tooken notes, kid you couldn't pass the class
I keep a loosey in the chamber, 'cause beef got me shook down
Paranoid, ain't got no time to fuck around
So bypass the clock when it's time to go at it
So we can pop 'em off if the chumps want static


Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed, motherfucker
Me and my crew, me and my crew we'll be chillin' and
Front on this and get dissed

When I rap I kill mics like a nuke blast
Little Hav's the man, the man gettin Van Damme
Buckwild, rockin' with much style
Check it as I wreck it, strip ya buttnaked
Pause and stand still while I just split a Phil'
And double up on ki's and make somethin' like a half-mil
Shorty's in it to get paid
No doubt, I got clout with the females
Put it in detail and write it
And if you ain't givin pussy, then bitch you ain't invited
I'm on some other shit that you couldn't fuck with
Destructive, and couldn't give a fuck kid
Little niggas don't die if they said so they lied
Immediate death to those who tried
The dark-skinned brother, unlike the others

Big Noyd representing from the Queensbridge Crew

I'm representin', you know I'm representing kid check me
Got to pack the gat when the beef is getting heavy
I'm going all out
You know moves I never fake
But every time I blink at night all I see is snakes
And I'm alone
Trapped in this trife life zone
But Fuck it, y'know I'm turning snakes to stones
You say to ya man that I'm pussy but you wonder
You stupid, I'm putting niggas 6ft under
So check my style go deep into foul
I was catching rats with the tecs since Juvenile
Listen, cut your conversation 'til I'm finished
I'm about to give the definitions to the rhymes I'm kicking
Real reality, life is just a tradegy kid
Don't get mad at me
'Cus that's the way ya had to be
Struggling Striving
Asking why my peoples dying
Its too late to ask shawty, who got hit with the iron gat
All up in his back
Like my man P said it's that unknown fact
But it's like that
The drama get iller down in the projects
Catch a rat with the what what (nickel-plated tec)
Guns are blasting, bodies dropping to the floor faster
Than years are passing and I'm gasping for air I swear
'94 kick it raw
. The B-I-G N-O-Y-D kick it hardcore
Escalate, elevate my rhymes doing another level
Huh, Im I share my feelings with the devil

Ayo it's the hard times that got me generating hard rhymes
I'm confined to the projects running from one time
Confide in my peoples they confide in me
'Cus if It's alright with them if it's all right with me
So we be, upstairs at the tables planning
Thinking of ways we can make this happen
On this planet, I'm struggling
Wanna be hustling
So I'm ready to face any kind of repercussion
If its Jail or death, crippled up or broke
The only thing I'm thinking is slinging that Coke
To get on son, hitting niggas off for packs
Only niggas from my block 'cus we get down like that
As I combat the snakes and rats, watch my back
Don't wanna be the one caught swallowing cracks
Looking reazy, before it goes down I be ready on point
Jump on my bike and get deady
It's a family thing. I got love for my crew
Pour some beer for the niggas that ain't here (True)
Yeah my man Richie Lou, rest in Peace
To my man Poochy you know we still love you

Don't ask why It's just like that. I was brought up to live the wrong way
At night to God I pray
Will he let me breathe another 24 hours of air?
I really don't deserve it
But really I don't care
From what I see, whatever is, it's meant to be
So untill I drop, its the crime life for me
Some say I need help, because the way i'm living's sick
I reply, ""Mind your own 'fore you be another vict'""
Many years of corruption, what will I end up with?
Nothing but a pocket full of memories of foul shit committed as a youngster
Grand larcenist/petty thief
Yo imma make this brief
In my early years, I was living fouler than most
Smile all up in your face take your money and get ghost
Shit ain't right
And I might regret it later that night
While I be laying in bed holding my thoughts tight
Waking up early in the me-our
Do my thing correct so it don't lead to the pe-nal
'Cus fuck that shit, I'll rather roam the streets freely
Plan a box to get
Send you home hurt, crying, broke feeling upset
Don't take it personal, I'm only tryna live
Tonight we taking donations so what you got to give?

First of all, we the one and only Infamous
Everybody wanna use the name soundin' all lame
We come up in the party with them shanks and things
Have you curled up on the floor feelin' the pain
And nine times out ten we ain't even start the shit
We finish it then they wanna press charges
Plus everybody and their mother wanna act tough
'til they discover how fast a nigga leave them under white covers
Was a thumper 'til he met the 40 thunder
Now I feel strange when I walk by his mother, it's fucked up
That's how the ball bounce, 
The cookie crumbles
That's what the guns do, dead you on the humble
But God forgive me niggas tryna hit me, what I'm supposed to do
You talk about my life and a nigga got a lot to lose
So I tuck the heaters then proceed to move
We a mob for real, you an example

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your crib, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for your guidance
You need to spread love not war
Cause death hurts whole families, imagine it's your moms that grieves

Two in the neck, yes you will, if you not feelin me yet
Outta respect can't stand it man, you niggas is set
Sweatin' hard ain't do shit but run your list
When a nigga get confronted all he do is take the fifth
Not the law, I'm talkin' about the four, niggas is raw
You ain't know, now you know leakin' down on the floor
Never renege with my words, believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it, that shit is absurd
Cause I be right back to my brother say word
You got to drive, no doubt, I cock it bein tougher for herbs
Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute 'til I move on you cowards
Direct, drama to us, Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad, make an album, get classes

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war
Cause you won't feel safe comin' out your res, knowin' that we got beef
You should spread love not war
Just think about your kids how they need you alive for they guidance
You need to spread love not war
Cause death hurts whole families, imagine it's your moms that grieves

Look around you surrounded by the M-O-B-B D-E-E-P
Infamous niggas rep Queensbridge housing P's
My dunns come through with the big long chains
Plus we got guns, to blow your brains
Niggas learn when they feel the pain, know I'm saying?
Straight like that, standin ovation with max
We clap niggas for less, splash niggas for laughs
Shift the game, raise your odds
I need 93 thousand for 16 bars
Put out the movie, the hoods rush the stores
700 thousand from out the doors
We the most thoro, need I say more?
The hoes love the Mobb cause we so raw
Handcuff you whore when P come through the scene
Glowin like a black light on white clothing

You should spread love not war
Cause my shit is popping and I'd be goddamned if you shot me
You need to spread love not war

Bitch Ass Nigga,Juvenile Hell,1993.0,"Bitch ass nigga, yo it's time to pull the trigga
I might be small, but fuck with bein bigga
Niggas wanna throw with that bullshit but step aside
Pull out the four-five, and kill him motherfuckin dead
Pump his ass with lead
Never fakin moves, motherfucker run the jewels
Buckwild, blowin niggas out the frame
Matter fact, don't call me shorty, kid you know my name
So next time, you see me, you better duck me
Cause I don't give a fuck G
Catch wreck with the tec then I'm out like quick sex
Who's next, bitch ass nigga?
Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (4X)
Kick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out
The little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about
You say yo shorty trauma, what's all the drama?
I shoot em up like their last name was Farmer
Shorty got the death wish, I wish to die
But when I try, it just goes by
You couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself
And if I got beef then I got it for self
And if I catch a body, I catch it for self
To me, murder is good for the health
Little man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic
Thirty-five niggas wanna funk, don't panic
Just shoot a head up, or take your beatin like a man
Or pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan
That's how I see it if I gotta die so be it
But maybe one day, my luck'll run out though
Until then, I couldn't give a FUCK yo
Little shorty one time, I'm goin all out for mines
Cause there won't be a next time
So what you wanna do punk, back up a little
Gimme some space, I'm hittin hearts, street sweeper
A little crazed nigga from the streets
Raised in the ghetto, I'm puttin out heads yo
I'm open, time to catch wreck, put em in check
Snap his neck, grab his loot then jet
Who's next to be a victim - easily ripped up
Get ready to run when I ripped em
Drop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war
Call me a thug who gets buck when I want more
Maniac react with a tec 9
Hit me up now cause there won't be a next time
Nah you don't want none
Bitch ass nigga - nah you don't want none (6X)
Who's that nigga standin with the jewels?
Throw on my hood, cock back the tool
Just to get a rep, yea you god damn right
Just lick lick shots cause I don't fuck with fights
Back on the ave, and five-oh arrive
Chalk on the ground where the motherfucker died
Niggas know who did it but ain't nobody snitchin
No word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin the script
Settin it off, yo, put em in a dopefiend
And cut em up like protein
The Lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed
Set it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm widdit
You couldn't fuck with the skills of the five foot
And all it takes is a set to get your crew shook
You're fucked up, kid your rap styles sucks
I'm bustin niggas, like my first nut
Should I pull the trigga
Huh, no question

You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood

I’m the epitome slimeball, fuck up out my eyesight
Fuck is on your brain? Dog shit? I’m not the clown type
Die fore I let a nigga play me, like I’m baby shit
Dog shit, you deaf, dumb or blind, I’m the craziest
Most Infamous rapper outta Now Why
Jealous of my shine, the truth is in your eyes
You wanna be down, I might allow you to work for me
The key words: “work for me”, I put your ass in surgery
Ever step outta line, forget who's boat you ride
Forget who train you ride
Forget who flag you fly
Read the name on it, Mobb Deep
P and Hav run this, employees get fired with some gun fire if it call for it
A thousand niggas couldn’t stop me once I get to going
You can have a nation of millions, still wouldn’t hold me back
Still wouldn’t be lethal as Bumpy the Mack
Matter fact…

Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood

Once we get it going steam rolling over them
Drunk off the drama, ain't no way that you can sober them
Fuck outta here, you outta here, soul lift
Slugs leave a nigga open like a coke sniff
You know our music got these niggas into dope fiends
No intervention could get them off of they OD
Grand royal, all my goons you see loyal
Dedicated in the cut, wait weeks for you
And when they finally discover you
They gon' need a dental record, you've been dead a month or two
Post mortem, shriveled up, how dare us
We penalize traitors and only hail trust
Inhale piff and guzzle white liquor
I don't know you, you don’t know me, you’s a lie, nigga
I can see the tears in your eye
You ain't see nothing till you seen a grown man cry

Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood

Yo, every gang, every hood’s in my veins
It’s my thing, it’s real, I’m in tune
I chill like the cold side of the moon
Silence you dudes like an empty room
Empty out with silencers
You get murdered like Albert was in a saloon
Anastasia that is
Haters can’t live, talking about they putting 8 in my wig
I got my dollars up, try your luck, you die, no trial for us
Court appointed lawyers as foul as fuck and I’m too fly
Cause when you’re locked in prison, your clock stop ticking
Now, you came home look the same age you went in
Mentality wise, get iller when boxed in
Fresh home, and right off top, you get it popping
Freedom is a virtue, niggas hanging way past they parole curfew
Blowing on that purple, know my street ties, beef wise
I let three fly over your head, 
Welcome home P
Let's get this bread, dog shit

And old timers puttin young bloods on them things
Just a little something for ya block to sing

Come up with new rhymes

Mike Tyson style, animal dunns, we live wild
Too many ways to die, we alive for now
We cross borders, take the guns along with us
Defend infamous to the fullest
Protect my dunns that came with me, they move with me

We all gorgeous, the most fly, the illest
Its amazing what my Benz do to ya bitches
While you bearin witness, we handlin' ya chick bidness
Thug her out, dug her out, you know the dealings

Flippin 2 not ready for what you and
Moms already missin you
Old fool from the old school

Infamous in ya area
Eightball in ya area
About to cause mass hysteria

Yo, ashes to ashes big gats to little
I put it to you clear while you cats talkin riddles
Snake and buck at me
If you did I'd say you got lucky
Trained to tread through land to get muddy

Ayo, blood rap
Survival of the fifth style cat
I puts it down blow a round at your baseball hat
Pee, Niggas saying damn why I be like that
Listen close you can learn from it
It's real black

Gangsta shit makes the world rotate
If eight was all make a nigga wanna gain some weight
Fat belly black motherfuckin D-O-G
And I'm a thug for them young niggas thuggin for me

Ayo
Fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my Queens Duns, Niggas who pump drugs
To all the housing projects who rep for they hood

Live and direct from the south to your stereo
Prepare for bustin and dumpin okay player here we go
Strapped with infa-red raps when I hit the traps
Crack the wack into pieces when I hit the track
Like stone to glass I shatter they raggedy ass
South style waiving my motherfuckin soldier rag
A hard illustration of my brutal lifestyle
Memphis Ten made a lot of niggas buck wild
The root to all evil daily I chase it
Blow it on weed and drink then hustle to replace it
It's hard from the start where I lay my head
We get rowdy and bust shots till we raise the dead

Yo fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
To all my gold grill niggas and my trail niggas
South to east we keep it hard for them real niggas

Feel my though, You don't want to get filled up with holes
Moms filling out surgery cards blowing her nose
Wiping her tears cause something on your top got shot
Should have brought alone wit you what you loaned on the block
Fuck, leaving without it dunn I'd rather get knocked
Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot
For a weak ass bitch, fuck that little whore
Even though she get my dick harder than the parol board
Stick and move, slide in, slide out big guns
Mack milly prepare to mob you steel phillies
Connected with Eightball dunn so what's the drilly
Out to take it all if you wit me then feel me

Don't get yourself shot
Bleedin to death hops
I pop canners off leave a nigga head whopped
A maverick my H-K will work magic
You'll find yourself in the O-R for talkin that shit
Street justice I tip the scale over cousin
I hold more weight you just a no name nigga frontin
Get your hardware lets treat it like a contest
And we can dance till one of us drop from being hit
Murda Muzik my street life influenced it
Its so real bredren I wouldn't test it I rep it
A renegade crack your top like devil spring
Vigilante niggas know the song I sing

It go
Fuck where you at kid
Its where you from
Cause where we from niggas pack nothing but the big guns
No mistakes for the fake no escape
Chop them boys up and puttin it in their face
Fuck where you at kid

To all my ice pick niggas one
To all my dunns trying to get the fuck up out of the sprungs

The Bridge 94,The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014,"""And if you start some shit your ass had better run..""

Shit is real on the muthafucking hill, God
Times is hard, visons blurred kid, I can't see far
Thinking will I be the next nigga deceased
Over some bullshit beef I pack heat
Son it's '94 and I ain't going out like that
Never roll a dollo cuz my crew got my back
And it's a fact, niggas don't know how to act
Till I cop back, react, leave 'em laying on they back
Sometime I try to maintain and chill
Stop my brain from thinking, restrain from grabbing my steal
I'm stressed out, trying to live right on the wrong route
Thinking of ways to get loot in large amounts
So I chill on the block, nigga respect mines
A giver wit the mac and the motherfucking tech nines
So pack steel if you come through, front if you want to
Before you do, so let me warn you

""Cuz you're in: The Bridge, the, the Bridge!""

Fallin' in and out, kid, I can't sleep
My body's in the bed and my mind's in the streets
At all times, with more crimes
At it, packing automatics, bringing straight up havoc
So tell your crew, a nigga do what he gotta do, lyrically hostile
With missions impossible/I'm stepping to your business
You punk ass perpetrator, sending the stitches to all y'all motherfucking violators
So recognize and realize, I'm not the nigga lie
You better ask somebody, I'm out to do or die
Either I'ma make it or die trying, and I ain't lying
You know I pack the motherfucking iron
So all y'all non-believes sleeping with your enemies
You offending me, you don't want any part of me
I'm on the fliggedy, the flow, I'm out the bo'
I'm on my way, grab my leather pelle, my 9 I pack everyday
That's how I'm living, I'm Illin' just like a villain
I got no time for chilling, cuz I'm massive, I'm killing
The Jakes and the snakes, whoever's in my motherfucking way
I don't play, I pack that heat everyday
So kiss her in your level, don't disrespect the rebel
You don't want any trouble, cuz I burn just like the devil
My mind is full of crime, my brain reacts when that foul shit
That made me pack the heat, stroll the streets, rollin Mobb Deep
Shouts to all my niggedies, fuck all my enemies, especially when
Niggas roll mistakenly
A nigga almost bagged me, he had me, nigga tried to grabbed me
I pulled out my banger and blew his ass badly, I'm nasty
With crazy mentality, starting a catastrophe, livin life tragedy
You know you gettin jumped punk
It ain't no one on ones, when it's time to dump
Tell em, dun, I smoke his ass like a blunt
Reach for my spine, pull out my nine, cock it one time
Made him lay down, don't move around cuz your ass is mines
Gave a crook look, I got him shook, he on the floor flinchin
Now he's bitchin, got him snitchin, listen
I pistol whipped him, Now check this
The nigga got me vexed, cuz I capped his ass
And jumped back in my Lexus



Welcome to the nine square, nine four
Niggas better step to the door like they ready for more
You want action we bring it, it couldn't be simpler
You could get crippled or hurt tryna fight back
I'd advice you all to just stay home
Cause if you beef you'd be running for the payphone
Hoping that cops come to save your ass
I caught you looking making sure it's save to pass
Through the buildings, quick like the wind blow
Not knowing we was watching from the staircase windows
In case you was thinking bout tryna leave
I suggest that you calm down and breath
Because I hate to break it to you but you ain't going no place
What made your outta-town-ass come in the first place
Nigga you ain't in no place to showcase them jewels you got
Next thing the nigga heard was gunshots
Two to his dome so his last thought is hot
So long as i don't know him, he can rot
As jakes look over the hill, their eyes sees nothing but nighttime
Due murders at an unseen right time
My sales run through underground pipelines and process
Loot with progress, and remain floor proof
You better keep your heat in hands reach
Cause I ain't tryna hear no words, or speeches
Get into your skin like leeches
I'm learning this thing that my streetlife teaches
You came as a whole but you leaving in incomplete pieces
And didn't expect to meet Jesus in your adolescence
Sending you back to the essence
So you can feel at home and safe in God's presence",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-the-bridge-94-lyrics

To all them niggas, reppin' they hood, it's all good
It's all good, 'til you step out of line
Went in the dome, out of sight, you out mind
Some like chrome, bag a bitch like phone time
You phoned them, I regulate, who am I?
Havoc and Prodigy, will go back, like go blind
'96 combined, put on all the people, we all shine
Every mother of the clique created

Yo, meet the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You see the clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, it's deeper then the abyss
Its street life, blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You'se the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
POW niggas is found, MIA
We move like the Special Forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to be empty
The reason why it full for so long, cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin' that they gon' rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage a motha'fuckin' four pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less the God gon' get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a - stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds
Live up to my word
If I got beef, niggas comin' in herds
We flush through your clique, get purged

Yo, see niggas lookin' at me
With evil eye, crooked eye
Dunn I know why
They despise, see we rise, kill a wise guy
My enterprise Cartel, we instill
Black steel on a hill
With Mobb scale, my whole fleet keep it real
The raw deal, to bail, destroy, conquer
Rarely wonder, like the sky, like thunder
Keep fightin', strike land like lightning
Increase power, solar, mind controller
The title holder, upsight when I'm sober
I stay bent, cherry eye, chocolate scent
Intelligent, vetern and cheddarin'
Mostly all time auditin', it's on again
Stick you with my devil horn again
Born again, wild hooligan
Pollutin' in a city near you
Comin' through, The Infamous Mobb nigga

Yeah man..you know...2002 man...approachin' 2003 man...where we takin'
This man?...where we headed for the future man...whats the resolution?
Verse 1: (Prodigy)
Wealth, health, and happiness nigga
Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas
Sometimes you gotta just handle your business
Fuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas
Punk, I wake up everyday to cathedral ceilings
Jumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars
Livin' like the pharaoah Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to C-Span
See the elite strength, attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass
We gotta survive this shit dun, it's nothin' to laugh at
I hops in the V, grabs the heat and I stash that
I'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap
Chorus (both)
I traveled the World, and been alot of places
Believe me dog, ain't nothin' like home
And if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself, you got drama?
Who's gonna clap that chrome?
Nobody like you, somebody like me
When death I'm ready for it in Threes
And me off point? c'mon now nigga please
I'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees
Verse 2: (Havoc)
Saw alot of niggas die, some niggas survived
And those that did did it by the skin of their hide
Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em
And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em
On the real, for me to be here tellin' ya'll this
Is like dice, then I rolled that Four-Five-Six
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
My Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, alot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain
And for a niggas problems had noone to point the blame
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B
Chorus -
Verse 3: (Littles)
I kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'mma make it out these dark days
Whether together or we part ways
I got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm
Three strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm
Who can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe?
You let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist
Vision the days, hear the ghost whisper
Dogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us
Cross my heart, let the haze linger
Pour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga
Thousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker, dog
You were his every dream
I kissed his face like I never knew 'em
It was me, once upon a time when life was ruined
Now the mink rope chain sparklin'
Jumpin' out of bed, Thousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the
Carpets

The Infamous,Blood Money,2006.0,"Just when you thought it was safe to come out
Infamous all in your face, in your mouth
That's right, niggas best to stay up in the house
Watch we getting our money, for the two thou'
Nigga, P back out in the streets, so what now?
Strictly for the ghettos and hoods, in your town
Pableek(?) got bundles of drugs in your town
Like crack, coke and dope - remember me now?
Queen Bridge motherfucker we'll blow your house down
We the big bad wolf that'll eat your food clown
I ain't gotta huff and puff you know my style
Calm as fuck, I just let my gun wild out
I got cash motherfucker I could have you touched
But I rather be hands on with that son
Certain things, you just gotta perform youself son
When I start busting I don't stop till I hitting, c'mon

Everybody got gangs everybody got clicks
But they ain't like this (the Infamous)
Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle
Of the young, black and rich (the Infamous)
You ain't crazy, don't make me show you
Why they call us this (the Infamous)
We own the streets - who basically control
This rap shit - G-g-g-g-g-g-g-unit!

We got the most gangsta shit, the second most biggest projects
We sold the most crack, since '86
We don't handle a lot of pricks, we the most thug
You think you're dirty over there, but we're more dirtier
We last more longer than them; more songs than them
More money for us, more broads than them
We get the most love in the streets
I had the most tattoos, ever since thirteen
P got the most now; our guns are the most loud
With enough bullets to down mostly the whole crowd
We drink the most Henny, yeah me and Jake
We smoke the most weed, that's mostly the haze
Get the most (?) kicked on a nigga's face
Gotta be the most idiot nigga on the face
Of the Earth, to ever let the thought cross your head
That we're not the most likely to pop off kid

Everybody got gangs everybody got clicks
But they ain't like this (the Infamous)
Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle
Of the young, black and rich (the Infamous)
You ain't crazy, don't make me show you
Why they call us this (the Infamous)
We own the streets - who basically control
This rap shit - G-g-g-g-g-g-g-unit!

Right now, I change guns with the season
When I was young I bought Ninja Stars on Jamaica Ave
Hitting trees then; started hitting trees then
We ran the train on the girls and on my family dance schools
We was beasting, little young heaven
I had the Rambo knife, and when I got my first gun I was cheesing
I couldn't believe it; I had the power of life or death
In the palm of my hands, fiending
But quickly to be scheming; if you choose to front on me
That leaves me with no choice but to start squeezing
And I hope they stop breathing
Because if they do pull through, in the hospital beds
They'll be squealing - talking to these D's man
They don't waste no time, they want answers
Even if you're still bleeding
Homey I'm on the fleezy
I ain't got no time neither I'm making money off of this - it's too easy!

Everybody got gangs everybody got clicks
But they ain't like this (the Infamous)
Everybody can't afford to live the lifestyle
Of the young, black and rich (the Infamous)
You ain't crazy, don't make me show you
Why they call us this (the Infamous)

Lifestyles of The Infamous,The Infamous (Demo Tape),2014.0,"My life is all about riches, and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Want me to put you on? Keep wishin'
You need to learn the rules and conditions
There's facts that you missin'
Sit back and take notes man, listen
First of all, the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The C.R.E.A.M. will have you shittin' on your people
Livin' like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothin' changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm makin' figures that I never thought possible
You tryna slow me down, you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tecs, and Amacuras
Kid, you get your cap peeled backward
For years, I been tryna blow for years
Gettin' bent off my wet, spend a G on beers
Livin' life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
'Til the coke oil drops to the bottom of the pot
My invincible  crew will never stop
If you lookin', you can find me risin' to the top, I'm a classic
Approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floatin' in the river witchya body wrapped in plastic
I'm tryna make a half a million, triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team dies
I could still hear his voice while he up in the skies
While the rest still livin' steady tellin' me lies
It's like a bad dream, and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love, and I can't give it up

I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the nine, let my heat serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organized fiend service
Tryna make a mil, it's stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills,  get your cap peeled, cause everything is real
But I wanna chill, laid up, in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
You get your life lost, never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you droppin' less than 10
On the road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place will be your ditch kid
No one can stop me, try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me, you're just an imitation copy
The theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' fat whips and livin' comfortably

My life is all about riches, and bitches
Snitches get stitches

Crime Connection,Mobb Misses Part 1,UnKnown,"Stupid
You can't fuck with this, y'know I know
Bring your whole team kid
Yeah thunn
Yo, I love my niggas for that
We strike back, handle business, test the realesst
Stay focused and keep the enemy near us
Niggas is careless, slipping up, switching up teams
Crossing over and getting stuck for their cream
Fronting like their skills is superb and got the nerve
To get knocked the fuck out, then kicked to the curb
That's for you and your whole click, you roll thick
More the better, so like a thick bitch you getting whipped
Shitted on, scuffed off a Mobb Deep song
Take your thug off, you had it on a bit too long
Tuck your chain in, you getting gat
For you fourteen karat slum gold cubic zirconian {?}
Talk about it, be about it, you ain't been doing it
So don't start, matter of fact keep it moving
When it's on, accumulate like cancer cells
With advanced shells, leave a snitch dead, son he can't tell
Like a Viking we striking, reconstructing maps
Planting QB flags, son we want to visualize picture
Analyze, situate another Bellevue patient
A cardiac arrest state of mind
You must be out your motherfucking mind
Put you out of misery, short your lifetime
Expectancy, didn't even reach twenty-three
First class shot, special delivery
No doubt you wanna leave before you wet your own crib
Talk out the ass at your own risk
And won't give one fuck, two mysterious Chevy trucks
Filled with black cats, crossing your path, that's bad luck
Everyone has a destiny, so we destine
To make the best outta life, crime connection

Yo, I send shots to any man who come too close
Niggas get fold like a letter then shipped across coast
Who goes to go against my militant crime militia?
Like these street niggas sending missiles to hit ya
Up from the ground up son, you get the picture
If not, write it down, take a picture
Botanical exotic shit keep me lifted, something retarded
You fucking up my high beefing, don't get me started
Too late, I'm already on your ass
Beat the fuck out anybody with you, and anybody that grab me
Move back, we attack like pits locked in basements
Hungry for blood, deranged this
The craziest type of shit you ever seen in your life
Nigga bled to death, standing up holding his life
Applying pressure to his wounds tryna stop the blood loss
Found laying in a pool of the shit, his own fault
It's P the exulted from NYC
You get extremely cut the fuck up by Scar thee
Who can't recognize? Do I have to prove all the time?
And get up close and personal in front of your eyes
See me dipped in down-low, ready for action, crept slow
Moved on your enterprise and crash your stock
Put a hold on your assets and dug your pop
National Geographic niggas is known for flipping
This animal wildlife surround me I live in
And flow through the jungle at night on expedition
I gotta jump for that live shit
Survivors of block wars and crime niggas know what I talk
In a black Tahoe, throw it in four-low to blow the scene dancing
Doing bout a hundred all the way to Queens

It seems like getting ahead lead being dead or in the fed
I kept a Glock in my shoebox under my bed
And had dreams to bag ki's and fill duffel bags with mad Gs
Parley in a condo with a warm breeze and palm trees
My projects is like a fucking Vietnam scene
And my team be repping, setting it with shit
That'll rip through vests, flexing Diamantes
When it's on I regulate shit the calm way
Yo I'm smooth like a drop top Benz with phat rims
I made moves in war gear and black Timbs
And laid low, cause I was tryna stay paid yo
Pumping minerals to criminals called yayo
The drug blocks, full of unseen riches
And snitches, guns blast to cops flashing pictures
Son asking, can he get a package
And took a loss when a new task force snatched him
Nine's and Tec's, my hollow-heads outlined your vest
My only fear twenty-five years and death
 {X2}
Ill minds connected, crime connection
Never bring beef in my direction kid
Cormega and Mobb Deep supply your section
With the infamous realness, don't try to test it",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-crime-connection-lyrics
Angel,The Mobb Files,UnKnown,"You were my angel
What happened to your wings
Girl I need you to fly
Oh you don’t want to fly
Fuck you then
I thought they would be happy to see me do good
Now they wonder why I’m steady screaming fuck that hood
Niggas talk crazy because I ain’t there, they ain’t crazy
They know me for beefing until I let off that 80
Even my baby mamma, we don’t even talk no more
She like you Hollywood ass nigga, your ass done changed
Im like child support, welfare, your ass the same
When its you against the world, tell me who do you trust
Some punk bitch that want to be in love on a bus
Yeah my hustle done changed but I got the same ambition
Same mentality, the same intuition
Besides a little money, man ain’t much difference
Still got the same bob when I walk with the Ruger
Nigga stunt if you want and I’ll put one threw ya
Not when I drive by, I’ll walk up to ya
Not from across the street, I’ll walk up to ya

Homie, you frown when you see me up
Then got the nerve to smile when you see me down
I don’t understand niggas fuck it
You niggas in the hood are like crabs in a bucket
Homie, you frown when you see me up
Then got the nerve to smile when you see me down
I don’t understand niggas fuck it
You niggas in the hood are like crabs in a bucket

Do the sight of the Porsche got them sick, yeah
Hope so, and if so, eat a dick or let it go homie
Had a hood full of friends now I seem so lonely
Money I made changed them, now who’s the phony
Shared 40s with niggas, let them tap the bottle
We was in the same boat and had the same old problems
Dreamt for the top, had to start rock bottom
Shit ain’t fall in my lap, fuck is on a niggas noggin
Hav so cool, but now I want to rob and blow your mother fucking head off
Nigga won’t die from starving
The rate of niggas turning on each other is alarming
My lady’s my ex-lady, yeah she got the same problem
Last record went wood, voicemail was empty
G-Unit Rugers now this shit is so full
A nigga eating good, my stomach so full
Now niggas want to stick me, oh this world is so cruel
Fuck y’all niggas


I know that you ain’t believe in me
I know you just with me ‘cause you make it easy
You ain’t got to pretend, we ain’t got to be friends
You can go on with your life babygirl go ahead
Running around chasing clowns that you choose to fuck
The kind of pussy I’m getting right now, you fucked up
You just like a lot of niggas that I grew up with
Get to know you long enough you just a regular bitch
Niggas do long years, come home like they the shit
Nigga I’ll make you wish you had nine more in
You were safe in that cell, now you in my world
I catch you without a pass, that ass get twirled
Like the weed, you get smoked up
Its too much police, you getting poked up
I know that you thought that P was Pooh
I know you had no idea but now you do",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-angel-lyrics
The Illest,Free Agents: The Murda Mixtape,2003.0,"Yeah, say it (say it) uh-huh
I'm the illest
Yeah, yo
I gotta be a ill nigga, with no denyin
How the fuck I get this crowd movin' without even tryin'
Made it out the projects, against all odds
Went from, ridin these trains to coppin expensive cars
And even so, all this shit don't make me better than y'all
It only means that I work harder than the average nigga
Never sat around for handouts, I watched and observed
Then quickly rubbed my eyes, if my vision got blurred
I coulda sold drugs (yea yea) 'til I got bagged and jailed
Out of sight, out of mind, niggas locked feel me like braille
(Feel me) While everybody was chillin'
I was broke like a motherfucker, loyal to my vision
Knowin' that I'd be on top or somewhere close to it
Nigga, my livin' quarters'll be the thing to prove it
And vowed once I got there to never ever lose it
Let my head, get big and slack off on my music
I'm the illest

(P) ""We done seen it all, done been through it all yo""
I'm the illest
(P) ""Let y'all niggas know right now, word to mother for real""
No doubt, cause I'm the illest

Cause I'm the illest

Come through with that seven-four pound I
Voice activated, know these whities just hate it
Thinkin' I'm a drug dealer, how else could he cake it
Bitch my shit's legit, plus I invested in stocks
So if this rap dough stop (yea) the show won't stop (uh-uh)
Believe me there's more ways than a few to make it pop (word)
You gotta have it in you, bring it out once it's needed (yea)
Be strategic, live it, shit it and breathe it
I won't stop 'til I'm famous, hostin' shows with Regis (that's right)
It's my world, my game won't be defeated
(C'mon, give it to me give it to me)
Keep them checks comin', thoughts flowin'
Words blowin', hoes goin', Havoc always holdin'
First one to fuck in back of the Porsche truck
Lord knows how many babies that chick coughed up
If you asked my enemies they would say it was all luck
That's why you see, mixed emotion once my name's brought up
Cause I'm the illest


Yo, you know you ill when you can kill two birds (yea)
With one stone alone and slowly emerge
From the deep depths of jealousy and envy's domain
Make chips then stash for the days it rain
Never cry and survive the pain (that's right)
Though shit looked impossible, to an, eye untrained
Nothin to lose, and know the game, be proud of yourself
Remind yourself, say it to yourself, say it

Legendary,The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014.0,"I feel the blessin' even when it's all disguised up
Even when the stress try to pile up
Paper in my hand give me wild rush
Reminiscin' on wild us and rollin' the miles up
So if I wager, I'm never putting the pound up
Let 'em hate, bitch, I built it from ground up
I hold the fort down, nigga, now what?
You could see it in the lives that my sound touched
I make money, take money, my aim hungry
Spit a verse, it ain't nothing short of a green loogie
Bucket list complete, I did a song with Bun B
And Juicy J, who the fuck fuckin' wit' me? I think nada
Lame rappers you Lady Gaga
The part you dear depart these niggas like I'm shootin' commas
State your business or forever hold your peace
Go 'head with that bullshit, motherfucker, I'm sweet

Got damn, who would've thought it would've been me?
Street legend that came up with a pen, G
16 bars to get me out the ghetto
And I always kept it real with the people, I never settle
There's a lot of folks dependin' on me to lead 'em the right way
Instead of listenin' to what the radio might play
Some real game for somebody that did it
Who could break it all the way down so everyone could get it
And I gotta admit it, the road was bumpy
Hand-to-hand combat, sometimes I live lumpy
You can't win every fight, but you gotta fight though
Just make sure when you on the side of right, bro
You don't go in thinkin' you makin' history
But lookin' back in retrospect it ain't no mystery
Nobody ain't ever did what we did then
And ain't nobody to do it again, nigga, we legendary

Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, nothin' you can tell us
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, all we do is kill it

Whole life we grindin' for the dough
And leave behind a legacy, the legend of the two
It's not an urban myth, no, we are the truth
If anybody gon' do it know we gon' do
Whole life we grind so hard to stay official
And make them niggas hate in back with brand new waitin' tissue
They sick to they stomachs, fuck 'em, I ain't never loved 'em
Peace to my niece, they ain't never pulled no dumb shit
Peace to the youth
The young soldiers in the street who gettin' to the money, they remindin' me of me
When you get that, better keep that, better not let that drop
'Cause someone gon' be right there and they'll take yo spot
We got our lane mastered, yeah, we got it locked
My haters wanna blast, man, you better stop
'Fore shit get good, you could see his guts
And it's too late for surgery, they can't patch 'em up

You see these gold chains of slavers, never had that to make payments
Yeah, I came from the basement, but now I vacate in Vegas
I come sell out in your state, nigga, just to make a statement
Nah, nigga, stay high, the bitch I'm with is high maintance
Homie, play me if you wanna, I got all my goons on
We gon' catch a body, but you gon' catch a tombstone
You don't got no hustle, you get cut off like coupons
Been about crutons, bro, that's why the roof gone
We still comin' up, that's what my dollar say
Ain't about no guap then stop, homie, we can't conversate
Mobb Deep and Juicy J been ballin' harder than Doctor J
Broke niggas what we can't tolerate
Got that movie money
Model chick came out the 'cuzzi money
Beat a nigga ass, now he wanna sue me money
Still in this bitch, wakin' up at 5:46 in the mornin'
Money callin', never stallin'

Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, nothin' you can tell us
Legendary niggas, we some legendary niggas
Legendary niggas, all we do is kill it

Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box
I'm like nothin to do wit it, believe it or not
I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock
Up in the rep bangin my chest off, pealin my socks
Niggas do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked
Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot
While you sleepin, I'm creapin wit the intricate plot
Cuz picture me up in the morgue, way before my time
Picture you tryin to get my while I'm still tryin to get mines
Asshole, have ya brain lookin like Castro
Dunn, I heard you wanted me (be careful what you ask for)
Bitch, if I buck you, damn Short snitched
The nigga just mad cuz he can't cop crisp


I observe the dread, winter time, big shot in my leg
Blood barrels, a big thick Benneton keg
Razor glass full, salute all teflon, shoot wit the left arm
We sleepin wit nukes, the blood is shed warm
High-voltage guns, nuns wit jums in the gums
Razors, lazers, bulletproof blazers
Yo, remind what the team chanted
They bought the jewel from a don wit a king-sized hat on, slanted
Kangol wit Bentol, ya mental, mid-war
Spill Hen' in the store, that's for the own'
Blaze wit a bent 4, yo these laws is your's
When we pour gasoline all in ya pours and draws
So decievin, flow speed change, lay him down, empty breathin
Instead of these leaks, we leave the weak weapin
Operation: apparatus, spray shots through ya grey Stratus
Straight up status for maggots


Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's and Q's
Keep ya eyes bright comin out ya buildin, duke
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death
Niggas slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma
I keep guns cuz it's like that, you figure it out
I got an arson for niggas tryin to figure me out
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin ya mouth
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down
Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it
Cut me a cheque cuz I don't talk business
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions
Take trips with my niggas to the Keys on the weekends
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits

Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms wanna hit me

They wanna know, where the hood at? Nigga, we right here
Live in the flesh with the Tecs, they never scared
Them guns we holding, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump-dump, reloaded the Amerikaz Nightmare

Dogs, I think smarter, reach harder
Slugs travel much farther
Niggas stomped a Timberland wearing
 face carver
With the box cutter, top gutter
I hover over you lames, run for cover, end in your brain
Yeah, you did your thang but not very good
And by the looks of things, You can't come back to the hood
This is not a good look for you my nigga
Wus really poppin, Inquirin minds wanna know
How you rocking them new guns, we cop those
Invoke, like we bought 'em in Costco's
Don't get yaself murk'd, wet shirt
Said it first, hurry this that red alert
You ain't gotta get buck to know that this letter hurt
The sight of my hammer, gotcha heart pumping
Nerves twitching, eyes jumping, heads will roll
When the pound starts kicking You be missing
Moms will be wearing that yellow ribbon
While I'm somewhere in the Carribean Islands, chillin nigga


You know we keep them big thangs
That make dead people when we hit brains
It's a wrap for the sequel 
get yo whip spray'd
Tho I rather hit you walkin, get yo shit shaved
Plus showered up,
 talkin then we split, hey
Won't catch me gun smokin, have the cops think
There was drugs that provoke it while we rollin, hey
Baby girl, I see you, can I get a taste
Of that thang, heard it's lethal in a good way
Just so you kno I ain't the one that get yo clit ate
But hope you got a strong back, I'll make yo shit break
You'll be walking like a penguin for a few days
Yo Bitch, you know we got BIG CASH
Money fallin' out our pockets, give you whiplash
When we drive past your project, ain't nobody can stop us
Infamous they can't top us, They want our spot
Yo fall back nigga we got this


I got love for my niggas, love for my niggas
Love for my niggas, got love for my niggas
I bust thugs for my niggas, thug for my niggas
Thugs for my niggas, bust bloods for my niggas

Yo slugs touchin, medics will rush you

Morgues made for you pricks
You know shat stay on my hip, you know the hood that I rep
You know we dumpin' them clips
You in the valley of death

Get comfortable nigga, you runnin out of breath (outta breath)
Ya blood is spilling through the ceiling of the necks (of the necks)
Floor or have you flood the cement
Outside somewhere on the streets, no longer in the flesh",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-amerikaz-nightmare-lyrics
There I Go Again,Infamy,2001.0,"(Ronald Isley singing throughout song)

Yeah yeah
Know what I'm sayin'
Straight burn biscuits baby
Yeah, give it to 'em raw uncut
Turn them headphones up
No doubt son
No problem
Creepin' it though baby
It's gangsta
The truth gonna come to the level

Yo
As this blood flow through my veins
I stand before this mic with a stepped up game
Some things when I look how they never gonna change
It ain't a thing
Niggas wild
Then I'm cockin' that thing
Cuz you know with every action there's a reaction
And there's no known cure when I'm sick with the clappin'
How many times it have to happen
Niggas talkin' like they generals
They just mere captains
The streets there's rules
Slugs hit 'emwith infractions
And then there's Hollywood if you want some fuckin' acting
You got these niggas out mis-representin' they hood
Give 'em heart now they icin'
I'm like nigga what's good?
Cuz you know how I get with these macks and these techs
Blaze 'em down gives a fuck about the next nigga rep
Play around find yourself getting' cheated by death
Man gone and believe me dog it happened to the best

You know a nigga
I be tryin' to chill
But now then I'mma hafta run these niggas a drill (no doubt)
Ther comes a time in
Every nigga life when he's face to face with that ole'
Kill or be killed
And here I go again
Grabbin' my steel
Cuz now then I'mma hafta run these niggas a drill (run 'em)
There come a time in
Ever nigga life when he's face to face with that ole'
Kill or be killed

Ay yo
Don't make me have to body something
Fuck you and what you known for
To me you're nothin'
I don't see why in the world
To me you frontin'
And if you was that nigga
Then you still mean nothing
Homes (what)
My gun is bustin'
Fuck all y'all niggas my stomach is touchin'
And I be right there on Myrtle Ave
Come through
You bitch ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
I get bullet proof love
Pounds and hugs
You get extorted by the thugs that gew up in your hood
You get killed fuckin' with P
You really should
Not do that
I use that
Lugar good
Catch a bad one
Ran dunn raggity
You got fucked up and left for dead in the street

Yo
Who wants it with Hav
Who want it with P
Not near one of y'all
And I put that on me
But if…


Yo
Believe me dog there's more than
Cockin' and squeezin' and
Afterward that nigga still be breathin' and
Who gonna snitch if you lucky to leave it then
For a reward nigga just might turn you in
I take it further and I might just murder him
That mouthpiece all together
I'm curbin' him
It's very clear and there's nothin' to blur my lens
It's very real
Ain't got no time to pretend

Yo
Feelin' it thugs
I dump a magazine on you dunn
I'll run up on you niggas with the mask and glove
Dunn there's nothin' for me to snap and get on tilt
I know it's nothin' for you
The pain to have me killed
I respect the laws of war and love
I live by them shits
Y'all niggas not ready for this
You not knowin' how you about to get your head crushed
Spray it dunn
Straight out
Shit it when them guns come out



We've got to learn to swallow our pride

Your loves in 187 baby (it's alright, it's alright)
When we beefin' we ain't speakin', feels like I'm dyin' inside (but it's alright)
Forget the trials and tribulations you been through in your life
Come to me runnin' - trust me baby, I make it right

You with me lil' mama, let's breeze lil' mama
We start with a lil' bit and take it to a lotta that
Love gettin' hotter you can if you wanna
Have it all it's yours just ask and you got it
The trillion cuts, the Audi and Porsche trucks
I do these things for you cuz you my dunn
Girl, feel special cause I don't spend
Nuttin but time with certain other broads I rip
You belong in minks, bracelets and rings
Not handcuffs forget about that locket chain
And just leave lil' mama, this P lil' mama
I ain't them, I'm me lil' mama
My baby, you crazy and I'm hooked
Your body right, your smile light up the room

Yo, yo...
When we first met on Saks Fifth, knew that you was that chick
Rolly sayin' holla at her, whip sayin' girl get in
Remind me of a women that, I can have without the stress
Asked if she had a man, couldn't tell if no or yes
Hell, I jus dipped her number and talked more
When I hit you one conversation, I knew that she had trust issues
Who the hell would do that, man cheated on her twice
Last one before that, found out homie had a wife
Looked so secure, but yet so delicate
Can't come back in the crib without a search for evidence
Baby girl, I ain't here to hurt you, here to protect and serve you
Ain't your fool model them other dudes don't deserve you
What you tryin' to do, scare me off and leave you low
Funny how you let it ring and never answer your phone
The accuser got me curious, I asked who it was
He like the ""sold-a-soul"" man, who the fuck you cuz?
I'm out...


Everytime I hurt you it's because of
What someone else has done to me
And I know its not really fair
Though I just can't trust you
Cause I just got outta something I'm not runnin'
Boy you know that I'm running scared
You treat me so good
That's its just too good to be true
And I don't think that I really deserve
To be treated like a woman should
Cause I been so hurtin' the past
I'm still carryin' bags


We can ball to the fullest baby (it's alright, it's alright)
You can style if you want, go ahead stunt (it's alright, it's alright)
If it's diamonds you like go ahead pick 'um up (it's alright, it's alright)

It started bout 7 when I realized ya worth
Sold drugs just to get you all, along with it's perks
Took a backseat, cause family came first
Holes in my sneakers and shirt
I turned 13, now lil' niggas selling coke
50 for 11's, yeah, I copped 'em for them hoes
But you left without warning, I guess it was a lesson
I had you but you showed me no affection
Got withdrawals, took you to the malls
The more I got of you, the more I got spoiled
Now my toes curl, lets have a baby boy or girl
Had you in Switzerland, half across the world
Grew up an investment and you can't be doubled
Came back around when I bubbled
Now I'm in trouble, took the wrong turn
Let my homie borrow you, now he won't pick up his phone

Where you going, baby? Where you going?
Talk about money this is money baby, where you going?
I can hold you baby, I can hold you, let me hold you

The thing about you is you make me smile
You build me up when I go down
You give me strength, you give me power
May no one come between this thing of ours

You give me sex, you give me gifts
You give me head from every baddest bitch
You make me happy you make me sick
Cause baby you my drug and I need my fix
If I ain't have you how would I live
To get you I'd risk that time in prison
To get you I'd take risks that'd mean death
I'mma love you until the end
Its all about you my precious, I'd never ignore you
For a bitch again, I'd put that on my organs
Got these other nigga jealous cause you all over me
In public, you be all inside my jeans
Took me all over the planet, places like Europe
Taught me new tricks at them banks out in Zurich
These niggas, back in the hood
Could never have you like how I do

 It's real, it's real

 Got 'em

Bump that - niggas try to stunt on my clique
Then when I get on that shit, I bring it to 'em
Where they pump at, 12-gauge Mausberg
No shell in the head 'fore you put in work
You gotta pump that - you done hit a nigga with it
And you runnin, the police is comin, take my advice nigga
Dump that - this is serious, these rap niggas
I'm just havin fun with it, 50 Cent, Havoc bump that

My son asked, ""Daddy why you carry a gun, you ain't a cop""
I looked at him and said, ""Sometimes you gotta shoot or get shot
Wanna go to show-and-tell and show the class my Glock?
Show 'em the clip, show 'em the beam, show 'em how Daddy lean""
In the convertible Jag, 22-inch mags
For a high school dropout, shit, that ain't bad
I ain't a Blood or a Crip, I'm doin my own thang
G-UNIT! Shit, I done started my own gang
I don't go that funny dance, I don't throw gang signs
But I'm a gangsta to the core so I stay with a nine
You think all I do is rap, then you don't know me good
Have Smurf hangin out the sunroof to light up yo' hood
Man, Carlito ain't never seen Blanco comin
But if he did, you think he woulda started runnin?
And I move with them Doublemint Twins, and two macs
I'll leave you flat your back - BRRRAT! Take that


Uh-huh, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
My life story is that gangsta thing, packin that thing
Iced out diamond rings; fuck linen
It's Timbs and jeans, puffin cigars, stuff it with greens
What's fuckin with Queens? Nuttin and not a thing
We kings of rap, shanks and gats, knuckles and bats
Get at me, you want beef, come correct
Stunt on any nigga in my clique-ah, you get clapped
We sick, so quick, you be layin on your back
Cause we don't give a fuck nigga, we love to dump
You don't wanna get jumped, better turn yo' music up
And bump that - cause we comin with them guns black
And cause of the hoodrats, know where your home's at
Fuck that, this is for my niggas in the hoods that
Slingin them blue caps, smokin that chronic sack
Get that paper, watch for all haters
Snitches and them bitches and them inside traders
Nigga fuck that


Yeah, yeah
If you trippin with my niggas 50 and Noyd
If anybody ask me nigga them my homeboys
When it come to drama know we pack them big gats
(We got a ton of slugs) Bitch, and it's like that
We them thirsty ones, no mask, we stick cats
I never handcuff a ho, I let you whip that
Let my money bubble, live off the kick back
This midnight shit is serious, where your kids at?
These streets too dangerous to let them roam
I done seen the gulliest of 'em, cry for home
Like a fish out of water, they gasp and shake
I'm a friend of the jooks and the dukes and the duct tape
Like a Down South nigga I won't stop 'til I'm ""skraight""

Daydreamin’,Blood Money,2006.0,"Daydreamin' of dirt bikes, and four wheelers
Shoppin' sprees at the diamond dealer
Hats and jackets, shirts, pants and sneakers
That brand new car smell
We sceamin' daydreamin' of penthouses in L.A
The illest yachts, the hottest broads they make
Can't wait 'til it's my turn to get dough
So I don't gotta fuckin' daydream no more

Coming up we ain't have much, a lot of canned food
Cereal in the white box, with powdered milk too
My moms couldn't buy me the shoes I want
We put lay-away on shit that only cost a few bucks
At school, they had Shell Toes, I had Olympians
With the weak ass velcro, looking ridiculous
I knew way back then we had to step it up
Cause waiting for the bus in the snow wasn't us
Me and hav' took the train from Manhattan to Coney
Everyday and night, just so we can got songs done
We had guns, weed, and a couple of fourties
If we got lucky on the way, we could jook someone
We used to watch video music box
And pray maybe one day we could get a shot
Outside, my niggas had all that shit you see on T.V
From money that they made off the block


My day dreams, is more like nightmares
A vigi, bullet proof cars, supped up time shares
My friends did a turn cause it's not they turn
Or how the streets gonna be, when they release fur
When I get that million bucks, will I remain the same
Or will I have to get at niggas cause they sayin' I changed
Will everybody wanna ball, be my friend and leech
When niggas put me to the test, have me clapping the heat
I used to think bein' rich, ain't all that bad
A far cry from what a dream, was all I had
Do I got the right team, or they riding for cash
Would they jump in front of me, when them cameras flash
Is the 'pop police, gon' be up my ass
Can't leave the heat under the seat, gotta find a better stash
Gotta collect receipts cause that bitch uncle sam
Invades your space when you evade his tax",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-daydreamin-lyrics
The Infamous (Original),The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014,"My life is all about riches and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Want me to put you on, keep wishing
You need to learn the rules and conditions
It's facts that you missing
Sit back and takes notes man and listen
First of all the foundation
Money is the root of all evil
The C.R.E.A.M. will have you shittin' on your people
Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing change but the clothes that my money bring
I'm making figures that I never thought possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of TECs, and Amacuras
Kid you get your cap peeled backwards
For years I been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off Moet spend a G on beers
Living life to the fullest
My story ends with a bullet
'Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
We trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes another part of my team dies
I could still hear his voice while he up in the skies
While the rest still living steady telling me lies
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up

I got to get mines no matter what the consequences
Count on my blessings add up my weapons
Cock back the nine let my heat serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend service
Try and make mill to stretch you know the deal
So we sling krill, get your cap peeled cause everything is real
But I want to chill laid up in a jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
You get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed watch you drop in less than ten
On the road to the riches
Hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try you sound sloppy
You want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
The theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury
Pushing fat whips and living comfortably

It's all about the riches and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Lifestyles of the infamous
It's all about the riches and bitches
Snitches get stitches
Lifestyles of the infamous

Too much dough to get, for one man to handle
Started from the bottom, went further than I planned to
It’s a whole new world and my team is on
That’s why your crew and mine’s can’t get along
But it ain’t no thing to me
If I die, just bury me with a bottle of Hennessy
And I’ll be alright but I ain’t droppin’ no time soon
‘Cos before you clap me, I’ma clap you
If I offend you, so the fuck what?
If you ain’t bustin’ yo gat, shut the fuck up
'Cos one less nigga just more money circulating
More clientele to keep my pager percolating
Some bust me, don’t discuss me, trust me
Niggas trynna thump me but got lump very roughly
Then we boatin’ in the three quarter
Across the water, Queensbridge is just around the corner
Well, you can find me at the store spending my rent
Getting bent, drink Dainy and save 20 cent
Find a bitch, take her upstairs and bend her over

A verse I spit is fire got 'em coughing up soot
A gruesome act committed, and his judges throw the book
So this is for my niggas, trapped in them dungeons bidding
No commissary coming so you know they guns are spitting
That's just the way we living society won't forgive us
But we don't ask forgiveness, we take it that's a stick up
Who want be opposition, that's when the plot it thicken
My mind is so malicious how you sleeping with them fishes
The world is mine I figure, and everything that's in it

My Mobb bring it back to life, back to reality
You walk a fine line playin' wit mine, the greatest story ever told in rhyme
We climax in ninety-five, wit demo raw raps is knives
To skin all ya’ll cats alive
Take your time don’t rush the clock, Infamous rock for good now
Pass like my duns on lock holdin' the pot down slow
But assuringly, spoon-feeding these
Starvin' ass heads catchin' shakes, feenishly
I ball in this, word assortin' this, probably recording this
Of course kids keepin' they sights upon this
Exclusiveness, like some new type of kicks
We got them things fixed, passed the wrong man in my click
You get charged wit intent to kick that bullshhh
Welcome to the ledge of this whole shhh

My kind of dunns'll be the ones that'll clap at you
Yeah, that's how it's going down, so what's the drill now, do it
We'll reach out and touch anyone tryna act brand-new
Don't even go that route, throw on your running shoes and make moves

Yo, for my QBC duns, it’s all real, we hold it down
You bust yours, we bust ours and stand on firm ground
Pass the dutchie while I, handle the Henny thinkin'
You never catch me sleepin', stay on top of this properly
I know they watchin' me, if not they probably waitin' for a downfall
Scheming on my property, we got the remedy
Let em get a little cold, let em smell the tree smoke
Hit 'em where we blow and don’t let nobody know
Theres snakes in the grass, you gotta watch where you movin', son
Shots get loaded, don’t ever run wit' the crowd, son
Stick and move, you hear me?
And that’s the way we rock it
The only way to live, if you really think about it
Every move is humble wit' precision, careful thought decisions
And my whole cli-tique the same vision
41st till I dearly depart
'Til then, I’ll be somewhere gettin' bent up in a den
Sippin' gin, while you shook cats just pretend to be
Something that your not, and that’s not good my friend
On a personal, I ain’t even feelin' you cats
Don’t even acknowledge the fact that you weak raps
We bust gats at, on the reg' laugh at
Son, you know we passed that
Get 'em outta here, 'cause you could have that

Four pounds, stumbled off grounds
Fire off many a rounds, I heard return fire 3% of the time
Your dogs was wives actin like girls, get feminine when handlin' guns
You could run or take the window, son
Or feel this hot one, we rip all strifes dun dun
Without a fight' thump, we keep the house dope like piefienies
We twist and pop Henny, gettin' wet on the daily, and
Peers get chilly, turnin' macks fully
Now they bandin', court rehanded and got remanded, faught
A one to three degree from V-O-P and N-C-C-V
And send me up a hub to a state facilities
What could I do but sneak, burn a tree, or tobacco leaf
Or wait until my time served and get released
Cool, back on the streets I seen some old drama
I still hold heat to send your ass straight to trauma
These kids started to drilling like they ready and willing
I gave em exactly no time to switch feelings
Pulled out, told my man, ""look out""
Commits to warfare, and rock these to sleep like this here
Seventy-two like as if I was back on the top
Hours of thinkin' about how I'mma tip they ass up out the basket
Belligerent glass heads, I’m bashing
No knowledge of the man nor his action
Class now is in session, “Soldiers boys, today’s aim is: Never show your heat
And don’t flame it”
You playin' life, wit a man who lives by the sword
And dies naturally against all karma and laws
What, speed on and get peed on

You wanna take the chance
I see it on your face
Do you think dunn hold it down son?
Boy don't be afraid
You made a sudden move
And my crew backed yours right down
41st side got the got the answer
 Infamous Mobb around
The heat goes up, the heat dies down
It's hot like Hell On Earth over here on this side of town
QBC in it, be in it
The jakes ride up, the D's just bounce
And in between we gotta get to screamin' at fiends all around
My money y'all, word up, word up

And my kind of dunns'll be the ones that'll clap at you
Blastin' at you son, what up?

I get at niggas like the stole from me, stole from me
Their bank account lookin' like no money, no money
There go police, shorty just hold for me, hold for me
You want to work? Then pump this O for me, O for me

Gunpowder resi' on the sleeve of my Pelle
I had to burn my leather, and toss +My Buddy+
Two hundred calls comin' in on my celly
I had to cut the ringer, like ""Fuck e'rybody""
Drive the bulletproof all the way to Cali
Lay low for a month or so - gettin' very
High - where I'm goin' it gets my mind of the bones
Back on the East Coast I bury
Now I'm partyin' with Halle Berry
This Hollywood shit'll catch you slippin' if you let it
So niggas started grillin' me
Like they was gon' take my things, so I assumed I had to set it
Now it's blood splashed all on the ice in my jewellery
They don't know who did it, cause I did it smoothly
Take my ass back to Queens
It's not like I look for trouble, it seems trouble always finds me, then


Look, I got tons of old beef, and a brand new forty
A hardcore groupie that would take a bullet for me
A high-priced lawyer, just in case a nigga snap
And can't take a joke, and pop a nigga over rap
A horrible splatter in a matter of a second
Dead over a record, shit he sound like he meant it
My crew greater, yeah I'm talkin' to you hater
I'm too major, two-tone blue gator
New blazer, big gun, little razor
So raise up, that ain't how your momma raised ya
They wire-tappin' to hear somethin', they ear-hustlin'
They won't bust him, why they came in and handcuffed him
It's nothin', there's more 'mati's (automatics) at the spot
One flat tire's gon' matter if they pop
I pop up tomorrow with the wagon off the lot

One of Ours Part II,Amerikaz Nightmare,2004.0,"You know, situation like this
Sometimes you know you gotta give back to the community
Gotta show these motherfuckers how to wipe them thangs off y'know?
Teach 'em a little somethin

Pick you up, off your feet like a forklift, but instead it's the four-fifth
Ragu red, your brain leakin them sauces
Like an, autopsy leavin 'em nauseous, when I aim at your bosses
Put a pep in that bop that you walk with
While my tec spittin at reinforcements
I could never be a victim of the streets: I endorsed it
Spittin that real, y'all cowards just coughed it
Like fluids in my lungs, motherfucker I'm more sick
You turn them hoes off, I put 'em on so they on this
You talk game grammar school, mines metamorphic
Dem fools ain't killin nuttin in the club, they all bent
My intent is to sober that ass up, leave 'em all drenched
See what a few cups of liquor can offset
Got a little paper, I ain't stressin, they all press
Ain't sellin records, they come at me for more press
When they realize it's real them dudes out coppin more vests
Better learn how to

Wipe, them guns off, get that money money
Wipe, a nigga smile, off ain't nuttin funny
Show, you motherfuckers, just how hungry you
Get, when your feet are touchin (kid a nigga hungry / yeah, he one of ours) *

The Big Apple, with the worms in the middle (eww)
The White Castle, the Empire State
The home of that Time Magazine new face
Metropolis of the world, I'll show you where I come from
By how the cash stack, and how I make a gun bust
But look past that, and listen how a killer be
Imagine the concert, they dancin on they seats
Shorty mad gettin stained, she damn near about to faint
She never saw a grimy dirty nigga like, P
With mad diamonds in his chain, she tryin hard not to blink
Don't wanna miss a thing, the song that we sing
Mad diamonds in his chain, she tryin hard not to blink
Don't wanna miss a thing, the song that we sing
BANG!


My niggas they can't stop us
Everysince we got our hands on the AR's, the S, and the fresh choppers
All of them is filled to the top with the vest poppers
We can get it on with America's Best Coppers
Soon as the lead pop you, whoever don't make it
To the funeral or wake can catch you on Ted Koppel
I'm a rare thumper, you just a gay nigga
With a rainbow sticker on your rear bumper
They say life is short, death is longer
That makes it even harder to express my hunger
And I don't wanna polly y'all, I'm a zone of my own
Sorta like Tom Hanks talkin to that volleyball
A ""Cast Away,"" I'll blast away

Kill That Nigga,Infamy,2001.0,"Yo, It's like this man, It's real simple

If my nigga was my nigga like I thought he was
Would he have snitched, hung me out the dry to fuck?
Guess you don't know a nigga 'till you catch a case with 'em
It ain't all gravy just because you make cake with 'em
It's real, niggas scared to death of state prison
To the end when a nigga get caught start snitchin'
Imagine the eyes of a nigga that you knew
For about 20 joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fetish nigga roll with the sorry fuck, now he switchin' to lame
Niggas in the box could relate to my pain
All I got is my word and I'mma get you thats my word
Through family friends or even fuckin' your bird
Fuck it anything long as your death occur
Whatever happened to death before dishonor?
It's time for your end and it's my honor

(Kill that nigga)
Never wish death, only if I have to, if it's my last option left
(Kill that nigga)
Should've kept your mouth tight he's losin' his life
Be locked up or sending out kites

Ay yo this nigga runnin' 'round runnin' his mouth speakin' on the wrong shit
What the fuck is this Dave Letterman shit on the late night
Creep on the talk show as rap asses get shot in they throat, speak on that
Girlie mouth nigga you worse than a bitch
I done shot niggas for you, put my life at risk
How you gonna go behind me and knife my back?
Must be insane and I got a cure for that
My hammer will knock sense in the nigga real quick
Nail a nigga tongue with the four fifth
Nigga you in violation of that code of silence
Niggas like you get real niggas indicted!
We can't have that! Kidnap that bitch!
Torture and torment that snitch!
We gotta make examples out these hummingbird fucks

Click Click,Blood Money,2006.0,"We get that paper baby boy, it's easy
You want to be who? You can't be me
Shorty gave me that ass on GP
Rolling in a G-500, or the Porsche, roof open
And I know that you're hoping that I fall real soon
But I ain't going nowhere, hate to bust your balloon
And there ain't that much room for all us
Limited space, the game like a tour bus
I won't break, I just take, take and take
Rape and rape, the game 'til there's no more cake
Snitch ass niggas giving up identities
Ain't my fault they making pennies
They soft like ice cream, sweeter than Ben & Jerry's
Like Hoffa, leave him nowhere to be found, but buried
The gun won't fail me, the money won't leave me
Stop scheming on me baby, cause it ain't that easy
Niggas leave prints cause their palms so greasy
Their mind read easy, I see right through 'em
The AK'll do 'em, like nobody do 'em, stop
It's best that you keep it moving, you'll get shot

We ain't licking niggas, we ain't busting shots in the air
No warning shots, the fuck out of here
Oh man homie, hate to do you like this
Oh man homie, when the tooley go click, click, click

It's the young high-roller, the talk of New York

Six hundred ki's, that's fifty-one million

Since the Feds bought Nextel, I trashed my phone
Listen homes, everything glisten homes
Yeah, my gun and my rims both sit on chrome
You move your weight in the car, I move weight by the cargo
I dropped in Marcy in a Murcielago
My connect is a Cuban named Flaco
With my aim, you a human taco
Meeting shells, yo the feds tryna peep our sales
My daughter grow up, she in Harvard and Yale, yeah


You see me rolling, Mac-10 showing out the window
When you catching me shooting out the Coupe, then switch your lane
You don't want me creeping two miles an hour, with my seat low
Cause I'll hop up out the sunroof with fully-autos and embed it in your brain

It's like fee, fie, foe, fum
I smell the blood of a jealous ass punk
One, two, three hundred shots
Fitting to ring off them things off, and cook the block
Old people, the pets and the kids
Whoever in the way, them strays gon' hit
And we don't give a fuck about the police nigga
This ain't Manhattan, this Queens nigga
We're immune to the violence, it's nothing to me
Fuck 'em, they don't give a fuck about P

So if you wanna creep, remember bring that heat

I never fell in love with a ho but I almost
Came close, found myself clapping natos
You know these broads now-a-days keep skeletons in their closet
Pussy-whipped ex-boyfriends
Strange reason I'mma meet the same chick
All the time, she a dime
Something wrong with her mind
At first conversation seemed normal
In no time she on you, but don't even know you
If you love a nice fatty it'll throw you, right off
Have her blow a nigga head right off
Nigga cough the wrong way, and I'm squeezing
Don't get mad at me, your girl freaking
Never talk much, let my hammer do the speaking
Y'all niggas conned to these broads, its a weakness
Pushing that seven with the deep dish
And you know I got that thing when I'm creeping


There ain't no such thing as chill, it's always on
No such thing as peace, it's always war
Every time a nigga try and have good thoughts
There's always something, and something always goes wrong
That's why I don't even tease myself no more
Or put smiles on my face, man that shit is all wrong
And all that is out the window from now on
My aim's to be seen on that page at the front
Whether it's murder or music, my niggas is anxious
You not gangsters, you niggas federal agents
They don't scare us doggy, we shoot at cops
You thought Pac was a problem, then you ain't seen a lot
Yo they took our comrades, what we gon' do
And yo Hav', you know they scheming on me and you

I ain't seen none of these niggas and we out here
Wanna be celebrity thugs, a lot of mouth, yeah

Sealed in the bag my bro, It's in the pocket
Fresh from the era of big terror
Yeah we made it bitch, most niggas never
Now look us now, we like a mirage
Of the day everything sought a boss
Captain Hooks, I front you at sixteen
Lend niggas a few lines, yeah thats mine

In a sober tongue, spit it so deep

They ask you do you have it
That idealistic shit don't pay your rent
I don't wanna start philosophizing anyway

Can you blame me, I was raised from a cold street
Makes for a better story what they told me
Sad part this shit is real life
Pressure on me 'nuff to break a fuckin' steel pipe

Wipe blood on my razor blade
Teach niggas how to chill out and make way
When you see me take it easy, best believe me
Its the real world nigga not TV

Keeping It Real,The Infamous (Demo Tape),1994.0,"I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection
In scuffles, throw all my blows in doubles
I'm coming from Queens motherfucker carrying guns in couples
And wilding, a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway back to Queensbridge
Black it's only crack sales makin niggas act like that
Back in the days we could scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connected in two
It's live Boo start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us so show em where we come from
Queens; leavin niggas done Son

To all my peoples locked up from Queens doing time, we still (keeping it real, packing steel, getting high)
Playing the street game, the only way to get by is (keeping it real, packing steel, getting high) (x2)

As we sling on the corners like we always do
Son get that loot quick, spending dough like I never had shit
I'm living large pushin luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my wake gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my Mac and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me if you do you better D.O.A. me
Son I got em shook grab a little baby for shields
You got drama run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill ain't no time to chill
Hit em up cause I'm quick to erupt like this
Wet 'em up with the MAC scratch em off my list
Show em, the real meaning of drama you never had it
Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet

Everything is real inside my mind; these days
You can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street living
Throughout the beef I've accumulated many slugs have been given
But wilding ain't the way to be living
You're only gonna end up bloody on a floor shivering
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile on the street saying no more peace
My man, Sto-Bo, kid hold your own
In a cell locked down not far from home
And at the same time on the outside I'm representing
Still packin heat make you cowards keep stepping
Getting high, it's cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
It's only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see these streets is getting sour
Q, U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think dude
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy I'm leaving in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin through life at a high speed
Watchin all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speaking in behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation, the Queens nation


Living in this hell hole, a place that I call home
But check my dough and nine, ain’t nobody taking mine
It’s a high price trying to live a full life
Yo it’s a struggle invite, living through these trife nights
Drama everywhere I turn, kid watch your back
It’s the liquor talking to him making him act like that
In this year of the 9-4, it’s more real than ever
Ain’t nobody safe in the land of  terror
Niggas catching strays, you’ll be lucky if you get grazed
I’m out to get paid, making loot in quick ways
Access the sex, pushing Acs across state
And Buddha make it on time to my court date
My destiny’ll be the death of me, to walk the light
To a slug that moves niggas, so put that in your pipe
Don’t ever get caught dozing in the mist of the action
Stuck without hoes and broken down to a fraction
Cause times a change, got to endure the pain

Started from the bottom, bottom of the pyrex
Hand in hand until that money went high tech

Major assets, forgot my address
Got too many of 'em, I don't believe I can have stress

I have niggas sayin': ""Hav' did his thing through-out his ten-year! ""
Capital H - went through wakes
Cold sweat bitches looking at me like I'm buggin'. (buggin'?)
Sleep talk cause them dreams be real cousin (real!)
They say death come in threes but it should come in dozens
Gotta watch who you loving cause that bitch'll switch sides (uh-huh!)
Some put me on so I know that bitch lyin'. (haha man!)
A blind make 'em see! - And that shit no good. (naaah!)
The hood raised a nigga but - I'm dyin' to leave!
Spread my wings, leave that nest (yo!)
Get that good money almost feel like sex. (yeah!)
And fuck! - If it don't happen then, it's not me
Whoever said that bullshit - they ain't see these checks!

Everything we wake up to this hell - reality bite. (reality bite...)
You niggas think shits sweet - 'till somebody die. ('till somebody die...)
And then we smoke to the memories, and get high as a kite! (get high as a kite...)
Drinking on some Hennessy! - And everybody goin' with their life. (goin' with their life...)
People say that the dough we make - That's Blood Money! - That's blood money!
They say our music corrupts the kids... so That's Blood Money! - That's Blood Money!
They try to tell me the dough I spent... That's Blood Money! - That's Blood Money!
People say the dough that we ho-ooold... That's Blood Money! - Straight Blood Money!

YEAH! - In 2006, 2000 ain't shit
I spend that on weed - spend that on kicks
When I was fucked up - nobody gave a shit
But now I'm up! - Ery'body on my dick. (ahahaha!)
You now 'bout to witness the power of Mobb Deep
By the time we through - we gon' be undefeated!
By the time I'm done - they ain' gonna wanna hear your weak shit
Our raps is murder! - In the beats underneath it!
Produced by Havoc. - Yeah you know where's it at!
If you need to put out a hit - you gotta see the man
Lil man study our words to help him understand
How to survive - and get through the bullshit
BUT! - I ain't no fuckin' role model!
Shorty follow me you gone be bussin' off the nozzle
I'm picking up the bottle. - Smoking on the weed
Treatin' bitches like hoes - and gettin' this money


Let 'em know dunn! Let 'em know why they put us through hell!
Flood our hoods with drugs guns and disease...
Tell us to shut up when we speak on it!
Man this world was built on blood...
All money is Blood Money! (that's right!)
Shit America stole e'rything!
""In God We Trust""...
Who God are we talkin' 'bout? (hummm!)
We don't trust nuttin' that come from these muhfuckers!
We never asked to be here...
YOU FORCED US!
So now we don't have a choice, (let 'em know Dunn!)
Get rich or die fucked up and broke! (NAAAAHH!)
New World Order? !
Fucking right it's a new world!
And we run this shit!
The new breed!
Do we scare you?
If so I don't know why...

Young Luv,The Infamous Archives,2007.0,"Fresh out some bitch pussy, hay in the middle of the barn don
Super hoe putting on a freak show
Inside the mini mansion, had bitches dancing
And a naked bitch who ain't ready
My dick is two percent head, ninety-eighty percent shaft heavy
Steadily long stroking shit
P stands for penetration while y'all parleying
I'm in the back, digging her back, got shorty hollering
Candy girl took a blast of the shit, I got her in
A pretzel, pushing her legs back, she wet too
Perverted niggas do this type of shit all day
Sodomize, modernize 'em up to my standards
1996 bitches got ran through, 1997 cancel that hoe
She blessed the god well though
Word up son, you know what I'm saying, you know how that go though
Caligula style, young love, model actress
Superstar, porno star on a mattress
Looking like Jada Pinkett, I stabbed it
The vultures grabbed it, money no date raped it
Videotaped it, handy camera record
The bitch is blowing me, my dick went soft young love
Scrubbing that crotch with Dove
Potpourri bitches get fucked and mouth plugged
So lady cop, secretarians and librarians
Midtown high-class hoes with pearl earrings
Bump into a true to life vulture like P
Beat you over the head with G, and drag you back
To the cage and let this Mobb nigga coach boo
Train that ass, put it on curfew

Hey, young love
Hey, young love
Young love, young love
Hey, young love
Hey, young love
Hey, young love
Young love, young love

Left it in the hotel, must admit we don't love 'em
Before you consider it foul, let me put you on cousin
Eighty-eight had a vision on some rap shit
Not knowing it would happen, down the road gold status
But back then there was this one little chick
That I wanted to hit, get with, the whole shit
Fourteen, laying my G, little me
I had to have her, had a nigga like me losing Zs
No sleep, fucked up in the head over her physique
Even thought about going downtown (keep it real)
I know there's niggas out there that would've felt the same way
It was the freak in me, actually crossed my mind frequently
Finally and once again we bumped heads
A stank gesture suggested that I was dead
Like a crack-head, didn't even give a nigga rib
But fuck it, what can I say? I tried to put my little bid
And kept living, nigga move on, you a man
No matter what it take we're gonna hold the upper hand
Shuffling beats, six years later son it was done
The Infamous, Mobb Deep left you stuck off the Shook Ones
And then the funniest thing after a show backstage
I peeped chick who didn't give me play back in the day
It was all love, hold no grudge, gave her a hug
What's the drilly baby? She was like ""you"", nah what's up?
You know me, doing my thing tryna live
Asked if I was busy, could I chill with her in her crib
No days, but we can chill up in the Ramada
Payback is a bitch, once I get in there I got her
In the telly, E&J dick popped the cherry
Left the little hoe with no dough and got jetty
Bless the god boo, you know how we do, it's self-explainable
Un-domesticatable, but highly we capable
The turntables beat you in your own game, enough said
Another victim caught up in fame's web

Everyday Gun Play,The Infamous Archives,2007,"Goddamn my son just got hit
Time to bounce out of north click
And come home to the same old bullshit
Call the emergency room then I assume
Prepare for the worst, looked, to see a full moon
""Hello? Did you recieve, a young black male?""
I waited, she said ""no doubt, he won't make it""
I paused, try to face it
A tear jerked, doin' the buck
95 North, 200 miles from New York
First reaction, called up son, what happened?
I was in my bed, when I heard niggas clappin'
Peeked out the window, saw a black coupe merk off
It was the Lex, at the time I wasn't sure
Police lights, yellow tape, ambulances
Homicide Ds state, my district took no chances
'Till I saw his moms, with mad blood in her arms
Tried to stay calm, looked down, it was the don
Shook my head, my motherfuckin' main man's dead
That was my heart, my motherfuckin' man 'till the end
Yo, I said ""Hans, you know the deal just chill""
When you get my page, meet me on the hill
1 L, Called up P, ""Some bad news
They just bodied don, inform the whole crew""
Finally in New York, schoolhalls met up with P
Hit the lab, gave niggas third degree
(Get the knowledge?) Suspicious niggas up in 
There don clicked brick, I think he used to cop that Chronic
By the way I think don bone killed lady
Ever since, shit was tense, and mad shady
He must've find out, set son up for the kill
Hit him with a offer - a too good to be - true deal
It made sense, don was on point, probably bent
Made a connect, hung up the phone, left the tec
Strike back, that was my man so fuck that
In the Tahoe, black mask, on the low
Doin' 95, sunrise they gotta go
Let the heat blow, no words, just let 'em know
Came to a corner, pull up son, there go a Lex
The shit is black, on top of that I think that's it
One in the back, two in the front, fuck it
Take aim, grab the gat, then buck it
I don't know kid

Every night, every day
All I hear is mad gun play
I think I'm losing my mind
Every night, every day
All I hear is mad gun play
I think I'm losing my mind

It was a quarter to two, Saturday afternoon
Me and my blood Stobo on the avenue
Jamaica Avenue, plannin' to stick a few
Niggas cop a jew, say what we gonna do
Slide up in the coliseum on some humbly
We got connects, our family works security
He put us on to the undercover jakes 
A lady copper, , a Spanish kid with blonde hair
And oh yeah, a white kid buyin' diamonds
He one-timin', throwin' niggs off cause he's shining
Everyone else is a vic, take your pick
Still a few niggas find just the right one to stick
Son, I got him, he just bought a 4G necklace
He had it on layaway, it's lame when he need a place
Catch him in the parking lot, do jux on the rooftop
Oh hold up, he just made a pit stop, at food court
We pause for a second, kick it with my man a few
The kid don't catch on to what we plan to do
He finished eating as he rose up the escalator
Told my man ""peace and love, yeah yeah, much later""
We got some shit to attend to
Let's not forget what we came to do
By the way I want his ring too
Minutes later, on the first level
He stopped to talk to some chick
Fuck that, it's time to meet the Devil
We followed him, shook hands, then took a cute picture
Now picture this, Stobo walked in and slapped the nigga
""Yo, that's my bitch, nigga, whatdup yo""
We grabbed him up, threw him in the back room
Where they be doing all that shit
Dug out his pockets, grabbed his ring and his chain too
Handcuffed his wrist to his ankle
Then jetted to the dance school
And layed low for a few

I Won’t Fall,Infamy,2001.0,"Yo, you got these niggas runnin' around like they head cut off
Like they gully, then switch when I'm spittin' those dummies
I creep in the cold 'till my nose get runny
Then I'm layin' for a nigga like I'm waitin' on money
I ask these hoes what the fuck they want from me
From the gate I keep it real that's why the god love me
I got a shorty if she get down for me, when I'm out of town
You know she holdin' down the crown for me
Dog, god forbid if i die, don't worry kid
Take you with me shit pussy don't want me
My life's story was the Henny, had to stop that
And now I'm focusin' clear when I cop that
Fuck gettin' clapped, it be more like applause
Since they tellin' like broads, might as well get 'em all
The H-, the A- the V- the O- the C, I'm the man
The myth pushin' shit to the white league

You can two face me, backstab me
A nigga still ain't taking what's mines gon' die trying

You can try to set me up and all that
A nigga too much on point for all that

What's toppin' the cassette, ain't nothin' gettin' passed
'Cause we gettin' fat, on top of that we gettin' cash
I hear you niggas wanna get, me may god be with you
Plus you better keep that mothafuckin' thing riding' wit you
And if i feel you a threat to my well-being
Niggas is bleedin' you niggas better back up off the P kid
I blam you, and pass you to Jesus Christ
You be a Ghost Dog like Forest Whitaker wife
Be a dumb mothafucka thinkin' P not squeezin'

Is that gumball 'cause I ain't got talk for ya'll
I got big four-pound towners give you new balance

The two-face niggas,  backstabb niggas
I felt that shit coming, like that in the bud, gunnin'
No tolerance for them niggas, fuck the dumb shit
I hope you niggas die broke, while we in the plushes
Hotel Suites, expensive car seats
Windows half-down bumpin' out mobb beatz
With a bad bitch beside me, raisin' up the volume
Know they hate to see that and that's why we come thru'

We do thangs, like raid spots
Probably catch you on the Hummer, just give you my Glock

This is what gangsters dance to, or turn to a thug party
Once we step foot in the bitch, it's on again
Outside we got them boxy trucks

The ho say she wanna ride in the shit with the horse logo

Gonna be a slug shower and there ain't a umbrella
That can help you protect that ass from gettin wet
I can see it in your eyes, your bitch ass is pet

We done crashed all sorts of clubs forcin' the love
Often above them cowards and them so called thugs
When we come through respect is there, cause we demand it
Know the mobb is in the building, we officially landed

Try to raid us the faggots snitchin' and got the cameras
Cock the cannons but shorty just keep dancin' cuz it might
Be a chance that it won't pop off
If it do stay close to the wall, we gettin' it on

To call for it, don't play my gun, it go off
Inside of your head oops, niggas be dead
Then we drooped in the Coupes real heavy on the gas
Out there like the concord
I show you how to get murdered, and the cops never catch on
I show you how to do songs, then after than show
You how to do them contracts and get yours


We ain't finished yet c'mon baby bring it back c'mon
You know that thing in the stash box
Ready to pop bast in the spot you stunt, you know we gon lock ass
Inevitable, can't control them slugs
Came from a place, that shape and mold them thugs
Flood the block with nothin but that gangsta shit

Gimme the Goods,The Infamous Mobb Deep,2014,"Ayo, Queens get the Money long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is living to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said ""Queen's niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid stay outta my way""
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
Can't stop 'til I'm eating off a platinum plate
Po po comes around and tries to dislocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
Cause having cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to having money to live with
I thought step back look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helping ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up cousin?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

Yo I was caught up in the crime
That wasn’t even mine
They wanted me to do two years of time
Two cops pulled up, pointed the gun said “frisk it”
One cop said “that’s the kid with the biscuit”
I started to run, fuck kicking ballistics
The cop looked me in the eye
And said “don’t even risk it”
They found the nine, and jury had claimed
They were saying Big Noyd, they was calling name
If the tool was mine, then I feel no shame
Never seen it in my life, so I knew I was framed
Then I called my boys, “What’s up?
Yo get with it, find outa the punk pussy motherfucker who did it”
Then make them pay, no time to delay
Check out the dreadhead from around the way
My boys got back saying “yeah he’s the one
The reason why you're there for the goddam gun”
He said ""I get the bill, you just chill
Before you get out the motherfucker will be killed""
I said “Yeah P, that’s the way you do it
Don’t let the punk motherfucker slide right through it”
You listen to the rhymes, I know that you heard it
Fuck around with me and my crew you getting murdered
Now I’m outta’ jail and the motherfuckers dead
You know who I'm talking 'bout the fucking dread
Put ya nail for the reck, with the motherfucking tec
They caught the dread pumping dope on the corner
Cling cling, boom boom boom, he’s a goner
So one, two, what you gonna’ do P?
I got mad beef niggas wanna’ clap me
But trust me, niggas must be truly for trynna’ do me
'Cause when it’s on I go loony with the fucking tooly
I got love to the thugs and the crack sellers
Stick together going hard like the Good Fellas
We go deep, Mobb Deep
It ain’t nothing sweet
Stick ‘em up then hit ‘em up for the fucking Jeep
We’re on the fliggity flow, yeah you know
Fuck the Po Po, back 'em down let the heat blow
They tryna stop me, these niggas wanna pop me
Swerve to the curve, make-believe that he shot me
The beef is still on, word is bond
But I’mma chill for a while and save a bullet for his mama

I got my mind on this figure
Now it’s time to get paid
Thinking of ways to take loot already made
There’s crime in the air, there ain't time to be afraid
Gimme yours or get laid
Give up the goods or get sprayed

Hey Yo, ain't no time for faking jacks cause niggas who fake jacks
Get laid on their backs, the streets is real
Can't roll without steel, I feel how I feel
Cause I was born to kill, do what I gotta
To eat a decent meal, niggas is starving
Don't try to find a job son, it's all about robbing
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown dude
Off the map, cause I react, attack
A nigga wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealing, only fuckin' with bitches thats appealin'
I'm fronting on the world once I start 4-wheeling
Cause back on the 41st Side, we do a ride
Sipping E&J, getting bent all night
Yo, who that? I never seen him in my fucking life, step to his business
Cause it's only right, po-po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground, my life is on the line
Gotta hold my projects down, can't see myself getting bodied
By a clown.....ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest and now he's laying me down dead
And up from under the benches I started hearing sirens
I stop firing, to cut ass like a diamond, jetted to the cribpiece
What a relief, stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
Out the window, call my son, ""yo son we got beef
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him""",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-gimme-the-goods-lyrics
Nightmares,The Mobb Files,UnKnown,"I have nightmares, nightmares, all the time
I wake up, I look up, shook up
Say fuck, put my hands on my nine
Niggas I cut, or we stuck, and they move
So we buck, they come back
In my dreams at night I have nightmares
Nightmares, all the time

Last night I had a vision of my dead friends in my sleep
They showed my things, I ain't really wanna see
They showed me flashbacks of murder
Scenes, bodies bubblin', in acid tubs
With they feet head and hands cut off
Oh shit, I had woke up buggin', sweatin' bullets
Checkin' for my gun, I gotta
Stop smoking that haze or something
I know I ain't crazy, I'll go outside for
Some fresh air maybe, it's 3 o'clock in the night
The block is on fire, took
My nigga bottle for a swig oh the fire
He told he just had seen the bitch ass
Nigga, must be god that's keeping me from seein' this nigga
Wanna crawl on me, and creep on me
Cause they know better then to let me see him in front
Of me, outside the car, away from the police
I'll turn him into dreams, demons in my sleep


Every time I go to sleep its like I stroll down memory lane
And see the dirt I've done before I acquired the fame
If you can see what I see, you see me
Poppin' the chain, or you see me scrappin'
I pull out and pop off that thang
I'm usually hustlin', bubblin', slingin' that 'caine
No matter the weather its sun
Snow sleet or it's rain, see fiends got a habit
It hurts so they feedin' they
Vein, and I gotta habit of havin' grams of it man
I'm chasin' the paper, it' simple i'm bout my bread
I cock it and pop it your white tee will turn red
See niggas that know me, who owe me, they see me
They run, they know
If I catch em I cut em for feed em my gun
It's real in the field, nigga front
And get yo cap peeled, with that nina, that tech
That ooo wop or that mac mill,  unload then reload, I live by the streets code
And pray to lord have mercy on my soul


Keep havin' these dreams, I think I'm just losin' my brain
I wake up in sweat, my girl think i'm sniffin' that 'caine
I try to remember, but none of
Them ever the same, I dream of my brother
But never since he passed away
He talk to me, and I can't hear nothing he say
Fuck it, go along with it, just be happy to see him
I think that nigga tryna tell me something
Though, when I see him I forget to ask him
Fuck I wanna know
Probably tryna to tell me, your gun , it better blow
When you in the street
Can't react slow, cause niggas in this rap game, think shit sweet
Getting disrespectful like I won't push meat
Should be poppin' off in my dream but then I get caught
Is he tryin' to tell me so my soldiers cause you a bust
Niggas wanna see my down, I ain't 'fraid of getting poked
Damn if I ever go broke",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-nightmares-lyrics
Locked in Spofford,Juvenile Hell,1993.0,"They got me locked in Spofford, the lil juvenile criminal
Two kids approach to put blades to my throat
They like my coat and ask me what I'm gonna do for that
Give it up? Huh, you don't believe that
So I threw on my hood, pulled out the banger
Swung it at the kids, that put me in danger
They put away them blades and said
""Why it gotta be like that?""
Cause you get a little ox, and don't know how to act
Yeah, now I got props, and I'm runnin shit
And when it comes to phone time, you don't get none of it
So sit back and just chill
Before you make a lil nigga have to get, ill
Only got a month left, so I gotta be on my best
But yet and still herb niggas wanna put me to the test
So I wild, with a blade and a Kool-Aid smile
Let the juvenile catch wreck for a sec
Damn, I wish I could put my hands on a
Nice-ass tec, and blow a nigga to Babylon
But if you don't, got a knuckle game that's a damn shame
Nigga I feel for, they got you washin drawers
But I refuse, cause I got nuttin to lose
Props I gotta earn, plus I gotta pay my dues
So in the meantime, I got a ox in my pocket
They got me locked in Spofford

Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down

To Spofford, and JV's worse than Rikers
Adolescents that ball hardcore
With the criminal minded juveniles
The real lil niggas step out of the piles
And I'm not takin no shorts while I'm up here
Spit em up, gem stars, but ain't no scars here
Protective custody's got mines
No type of help, I'm in here for self
And so I got locked up on a one to two
On the bus, catchin beef with mad crews
Run my shoes, fuck that, I'm goin out kid
But not too buckwild, cause I gotta finish my bid
Four times, for my peoples up from the 'Bridge
Here, it takes a lot of heart to live
Behind bars, child correction
Trapped in the buckwild dorm E section
They got me smokin the death sticks
Niggas got me fightin for my life, cause shit is real
Shorty kill a man got locked down
You want a buck sixty, you betta betta back down
On the streets a hood, but in here
You're up to no damn good, nigga I wish you would
Try to take mines, and try to shank mines
Shorty corrupt, there's no stoppin me
Even in jail, I tear shit up
And when I get out, it's gonna get worse
The devil in the flesh
I'm puttin hammers on a hearse
So while I'm in here, don't forget my name
Ain't shit changed, I'm still the motherfuckin same
I couldn't bitch up when I got here
Cell wreck, I got shit locked here
One more month I'm goin Uptown
To the big pen, and I'mma still win
Cause jail is my life, and I like it here
Ain't no rules, you can do what you like in here
Jailhouse blues, I miss the ghetto
C.O.'s think they're five-oh's with no heat
So what am I to do when they step
Put em in check, and throw hands with a redneck
And now I got a little crew to watch my back
Lunchtime comes huh, you ain't gettin none of that
Cause I got shit sewn up real tight
Not one bit of fright, while I'm locked in Spofford
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down
Damn, they got me locked down
Locked down, they got me locked down

Just so they can get a few tokes of the dope
New shit from Hav and shit P wrote, yo they passin new laws

Niggas shoot, too fast, to pull out your gun last
That's why I like to spark first, and shoot your
Bitch-ass down your next ride'll be a fuckin hearse
Cause little niggas don't die son
Half-step and get that ass lit up like a flare gun
Cops they want static, whatever they can have it
My name is Prodigy and I'm known to cause havoc
And when I flip I be on some ill shit
I walk the street, like a real super trooper
The block shit proper, who once got had
Mad beef with the dread who sold me that dirt bag
Mad props to the bad little niggas in the neighborhood

Dead you on your coat, then cut your motherfuckin throat
Takin life like a thief in the motherfuckin night
While I write write, you bite bite bite
Niggas wanna step to my business
But I just parlay and sip on my Guinness

Don't fuck with suburb chicks, I need a gangsta bitch
Don't need a crew, I can bust you down solo fast
And after that, dip into the weed stash
I'm quick to blast, enemies won't last the fate
I kill em fast so they can't retaliate
Cause when I'm not alive who'd takes my place

Block Life,The Infamous Archives,2007.0,"Yo, my life story - based on a true story
We popped MAC's all growin' up, while y'all played story
We were playin' hide the cracks, while y'all played tag
I was a young gun learin' how to fight back
A 'lil rock head fuck, who neva learned shit
Who picked up a habit for the block life kid
A few cases, sit on the bench, make conversation
Yo, there's party tonight, get the razors
""Dawg, but it's all goin' overboard""
I told 'em - ""Dang god you tryin' to take a nigga arm""
We're like a brick, when we come smashin' through
A-C-D, M-O-B, nigga fuck it's you
We're straight thugs over here bo', what the deal y'all?
Up in the staircase, post-up, long chrome
With the .4 long, closest I could reach my arm
Who wanna play target, check out the name of the song
It goes...

Block - Life, what's the matter with your thugs
Block - Life, what's the matter with y'all's guns
Block - Life, everybody can't be on top
The Block - Life, can't stop, won't stop

Comin' up, I was a fuck up, burnin' blunts up
Playin' dice with the older crowd, puttin' dubs up
Some kids was into sports, I was into doe
You was mad cause you felt all I was stress
Cause the money was slow
Fractured my hand, I'm stashin' 'em
Before I'm bagged wit 'em, plus my son got the Magnum
Wyldin' out in these young gun days, young love days
New to the game, but was curious about the fees
And them thick rope chains, I'm stuck on how
Niggas blew up off cocaine, and opened wide
In '88, when I first heard Jane, we got all the --
But the hood still remains the same
Old fiends, same drugs, new thugs
Same slugs, new crews with MAC's
With thoughts to push it back, straight like that
Actin' up off Cognac, come through
Act hostile, but lay you flat, in the --


Yo, we use to play the lobby
Get bent; see that was my favorite hobby
Watchin' my dawgs get off, some even framed Ferrari's
Alot of school peers blew, some even bought Ferrari's
Young thugs we grew, still we're crashin' parties
Too all the shooks ones too, my crew'll bash & body
Dukes stuntin' witchu, don't make us clap somebody
New rats and other run fast and tellin' friends who looked fat
We off the hook as the jook style
Years went by pages turned onto calendar
Trade in my Tray .8, copped the .40 Caliber
Kept it on me in school, got shorty cuttin' out Algebra
Niggas always seemed cool, others tryna to challenge us
Retaliation, got me trapped with false accusation
Tossed cracks & graders, when the ambs' invaded, madd congregation
Watchin' altercation go down, the rough frantic, when the hear the .4 pound

Breath smellin' like piff
Wired up fire up another one
Let's get lifty, real dopey
Pour me another cup of that hellfire, watchin' for the police
We outside choppin' it up, shootin' the shit
Couple niggas making bangs, I'm just tryna spit
Some good rap to this bitch that I've been tryna hit
Since we was nineteen, damn, she still fine as shit
Remember at the card tables feelin' on my dick?
Got pregnant by that nigga, I ain't seen her since then
It ain't nothin' like the hood, sittin' on top the benches
You terrified where I'm comfortable in the trenches
Most of my friends is in projects, nigga
Brooklyn, Queens, the whole NY, nigga
Nigga, pull your card like a ATM
Mistook me for fool, found out that I'm poison on the block

A staple in the hood like the liquor store
In the church, I'm cut from a different cloth
The fabric of life in every Hav verse
Pull your cabbage wig worm, I did mad dirt
Deserve this groove so you fear to lose
Have your whole team rockin' R-I-P tattoos, rested and hooked to IVs
N-Y-C, city of the crime scene
Paint a better picture, call me ace Banksy
They scoop you off the floor like fall raked leaves
Nigga, take a knee 'cause this one over
You in the fourth quarter with the reaper on your shoulder
Around every corner or at least most of them
Somebody gettin' money or a chest openin'
The pain so real not even Motrin could take away the pain or save a closest friend

What up kid?
You not from 'round here

He had distorted vision, thought I ain't deserve this
How he the streets, and I ain't put no work in

You the nigga that was careless, get the fuck out of here
Yeah, blood, sweat, and tears, every buck I made
I ain't complain when you was hustlin' and I leave paid
Yeah I'm up, boilin' blood to see me bust
Even worse they ask for help, like I'm the Red Cross
I don't knock niggas when they down, I try to lift 'em
But they tried to get all in my shoes, like they could fit 'em
Can't happen overnight, when it comes to winnin' (Naw)
It's a ten year road, but niggas ain't tryin' to hear it

Orders that we makin', they be takin' too easy
Niggas can't get any money cause they palms so greasy
Don't know how they survivin' though, they wish they could be
Niggas better watch they mouth, or stop speakin' so freely

You listenin' to the world's most Infamous
This is different than what you used to
Them other niggas, they ain't killin' it
We come through militant, niggas be grillin' it
Screwin' up they face, but my adrenaline
Is at a maximum, I can't be touched
Just as soon niggas move, niggas get tore up
We so confidant in ourselves, it's not fair
While you still tryin' to overcome your childhood fears
We settin' up shop, takin' over the blocks
In e'ry hood, e'ry boy, and e'ry girl gon' cop
Now we chillin' in, new airplanes and Rolls Royces
My watch is my president - and guess who's the first lady?

Knives and forks, ain't no time to think, it's on
Just move on them niggas with excessive force
And don't stop 'til them niggas don't move no more

Informers tell when snitches snitch
Fuck them, buck more shots, get out that bitch
Cribs is found, careful when the kids is out
Torch your house, stalk your kin, bitches and friends

Fuck liquor, for my nigga, we gon' pour some blood out

Street Lights,Black Cocaine,2011.0,"A lot of money got made, drugs got sold
Lives got took on these corners so cold, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life
Every ghetto in America is all the same
Chasing after money got us all insane, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life

Ah, I look back and reflect doing a hundred pass
Thinking about it got me heavy on the gas
Vivid is the picture coded in my DNA
Mammy bless her heart, as we walked out the door she would pray for us
Knew that Jake was on us, deck stacked against us
Same shit different toilet, uh
Another life flushed down the commode
Left the house without saying goodbye and didn't come home
It's all too common, and prolly me if it wasn't for rhyming
I put that on my brother who was wildin with the iron
The hood is full of life but inside niggas dying
Instead of prosperity, only jealousy's thriving
Street lights... made as makeshift memorials
Know how the story goes, I ain't trying to bore you though
I'm just trying to shed a little light
Job done, even if I save only one life, listen

A lot of money got made, drugs got sold

Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life

Chasing after money got us all insane, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life

Missing dark tunnel vision, the light at the end, damn is anybody listening
I'm talking to myself again, we so close but yet it seems so far
It's like 10 steps back and just one step forward
Just one more push and sixteen more bars
Closer to the dreams we have, the life we want
If these blood sweat and tears could talk, they'd be arguing
With the look in our eyes saying all, listen
That bone in your head, get shattered like a windshield
Now how that shit feel?
Yeah you got a lot of nerve, you deserve
Every drop of that pain, when you playing with the Mobb
Can't you see we concentrating on this baking
Lot of lives got taken, lot of time spent in the cages
So we spend our days just
Doing whatever must be done to become
The ones that steady burn like the sun because

A lot of money got made, drugs got sold

Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life
Every ghetto in America is all the same
Chasing after money got us all insane, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life

I can tell you about some shit you don't really wanna hear
So many disappear out here
One time I saw a man with a gun
Chasing another nigga trying to run
And even know they grew up on the same block
He ain't hesitate to gun him down in the same spot
The nigga that you knew from elementary
Will make your ass an unsolved mystery

A lot of money got made, drugs got sold
Lives got took on these corners so cold, oh
Imagine if these street lights, could talk and tell the story of the street life
Every ghetto in America is all the same

Come and get washed up

Lame ass team that you got off of the mat
Weak cat, pull it back, please do repeat that
Queens rep: we got more than a little of that
We used to daydream on the bench how we could cease this
And conquer like the British in snapbacks and fitteds
Getting soaked up, no love, the boy's back, he showed up
Soldier up, you know it up, come and get folded up
Your bitch is attracted to all of this madness
She want a felon, she ain't fuckin with no graduates
Bad hood, bitch magnet, I'm a savage

Woo, yeah I'm talkin' if you don't talk what you do shorty

It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid; they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
And at the show they do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50 and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said ""Thanks""
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggas bringing me they girl like, ""You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-Unit!""
Man, little groupies, they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel, unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick

Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around - yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

Shorty what's up? You know you wanna roll with a nigga
I'm tryna fuck, if you decide to go with a nigga
I'll tear it up, in the telly you'll be loving a nigga
I'll work that, work that, yeah I'll work that, work that

It's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage
Harder than the politician on the campaigne
No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up 'til you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number, she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nutt on her neck
They don't call us the master of the tour for nothing
We destroy good girls; send them home with pussy soft from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning and somebody White-T'd
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus

Rhymes rusty like nails
Spit 'em catch lock jaw
Cook shit, spit it up, sit it on the floor
To prevent lop side I never slam the door
To never get shitted on, don't put my faith in whores
Never let my information leak thru my four walls
Yo they say I'm on some shit cause I screen my calls
No matter if I'm in the right, I'm a probable cause
Keep my stash by the  while your guns get tossed
Niggas live by the law then they die by the law
Dunn I live by the gat and I'mma die by that
Dunn I used to be the tunnel now we 
Son it's strictly dom bitches never catch me with rats
QB where I took my first H we rep
Never leave the projects and ya'll know the rest

Nobody likes me everybody hates me so I got to pack my gun
We carry big ones small ones sneak 'em into clubs dun
So you never catch me run

Yo you ran, started feeling numb in your hand
Felt something dripping looked down seen your arm leaking
You get excited and start to panic
Lucky for you, ya had your track shoes on and blew it
My gun arch louder than a Doberman bark
Sober you up, challenge your heart, see where its at
I caught this on dude tried to shank me
Stupid fuck frankly I pulled out and left his ass soggy
Keep rhyming on the Ragu can't seem to shake it
Ruger on the left side of my hips for maintenance
I fix all your problems, handle it bitch
You's a Maytag nigga and ya won't do shit
After you shot you got all emotional with mami
Laying in emergency throw the D's on me
Squealer I thought you was a drug dealer, thug killer
But at the end you kept it realer
That's why..

Ayo I leave the last impression when my shit gets scared
Tying to hang with the elite but a nigga got bought
When it's time to mellow out stare straight into stars
Then I sabotage your brain with these last 8 bars
With your ice grill making me laugh on your behalf
Have a nigga skin graph I'm talking out of the ass
Play you like the ave getting bent off, credit from poppy
Knock niggas down when I get like that
So start me

I'm putting holes in your body like ya pausing a party
Then drown your open sores with Bacardi
My gun dun step aside the place and make heads spin
Aw shit, there go the Mobb niggas, keep your distance
Fake fucks keep coming out using ""Infamous""

Aye yo son where my real thugs n' them at

While we slutting them all then passing them off
Peeling off in that Bentley coupe
Got ma wetting them draws
You know I keeps them in that birthday suit
She know once that she up in that ride
And we get pulled
The hammers going in between her thighs
Need a chick got to explain a thing
She hip to it the games in her blood
And down for the grind
Till the death rep M.O.B.B
You a problem with it then you know where to reach me

Your mouth was going off
Meanwhile we counts money piles
Till our fingertips green and them shits is sore
But we prefer plastic now
Its nothing like when its your tour stacking cash on the floor
Saran wrap to the top jumpoffs won't fall down
Its not my cash your bitch love
Its how I kill it on the song
And she get a taste of the dick
She open now
Its shiny like a door and I don't pay the bitch no thought
I got alot of gall
Thats what the bitch haal
While I'm leaving her sight my heart is real cold
Real hard on a ho
But much much harder for the dough
It be a bloody slaughter when we through

So don't get mad because your ho probably sucking the kid
Attracted to the lifestyle of how us gangsters live
Teach her all about life

And how I stick, and move all you see is a blur

And can't nobody squash this beef

And do, what I'm 'posed to do, approach Duke
Why you faggots only squeezin from out, the vocal booth?

Open your face was talkin, wasn't talkin to you
And now the medics gotta mind to your face, tyin the lace

And held a chocolate Thai Buddha, now I'm looser
I fantasize about this crew I took last week
And yo, that's me at the sympathy, to pass me
But I was brought to reality, a rude awakening
My man just got taken, it's mad time he's facing
Jetted upstairs, got a call from my cousin
Back in Brooklyn, only fifteen the kid is bugging
Told me about the spot that he hit that had a drop on the spot
But his man almost got shot
Now it's the talk of the block cause he's dead and in the cab
The Troy Ave laughed, then he started tumble (?)
Counted the cash, but one nigga tried to stash
Who wet the quills? niggas was up in his ass
As he kicked it, by the little story that he told
I was fickled in his hold, then off the old gold
Till I got to be on the other line, put him on hold
It was my shorty, told her call me back, kid you're too old
It was a quarter to one, Friday night
Loaded up my guns to blow the horns, called up my son
Son, you come through I got a proposition for you
Keep it on the low so the plan won't spoil
My crew's loyal, they came over in a minute
To kick it 'bout this nigga, who think he getting bigger
Pumping on our side, don't even know him from a hole
In the wall, tonight's going to be his downfall
So fuck him and everything he stand for
About this time, he be on the corner
Slinging with a crackhead, kept me bringing
Sales to the building, a bunch of bitches fiending
I figure we could get the goods, kill the nigga
And be it that we live right next to the river
We can catch him off guard, throw him in the water
Before the coastguards come on God this shit ain't hard
But think, the one you give a couple up's your fate
And keep your eyes open for the jakes, the snakes and the snitches
The ones you see, the nigga with the riches
Acting like a little bunch of bitches
Pointing me out in pictures
The Five-O's like ""you know who is this""
It's Havoc, you better recognise it, realise


In morn' store, for y'all niggas who once swore
Sure to trigger press, to lick you in the jaw
Raw, bullet holes, all in your clothes
Your Volv's, now you lay with your eyes closed
In a casket you bastard, you went too fast kid
Shouting why I motherfucking blasted
Hectic, I can't believe the shit beneath my eyes
I cannot think straight, or I might get hypnotised
I don't stress shit, cause I'm out to get mines
So when you step to me, you will be surprised
The type of shit I kick is so you're leaking in the skies
So when you say the Mobb Deep time is a lie
You'll be swimming in a puddle of Death, and that's no threat
Hectic, hectic, hectic, hectic

When things get real, it ain't what you expected
Me and my peoples is known to get hectic
Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions
Make them see the light when my shots make connections
Niggas get they face split in sections
Shook using ice grill looks for they protection
We absorb everything you fear
And indulge in a crime-filled atmosphere
This shit ain't nothing new, it's only things that we used to
We used to stick niggas on the F through to the E train
When it's time to recruit, I humble on the D train
See my man D only to purchase my dope thang
Word to my unborn seed
A nigga got to make loot to support greed
On the wild side of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion
It's so cold you might get frozen
If you leave yourself vulnerable, in time lapsing
Fools collapsing, and caught up in gun clapping
Don't matter who you are, if you know many faces
I don't discriminate, my shots bleed all races
And cultures, we sort of like vultures
Eating your insides like ulcers
And pause niggas pulses, like",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-we-about-to-get-hectic-lyrics

You can take it to the heart bitch nigga play your part
All you saw was the spark now you laying in the dark
From the hood that I rep every nigga in my set

Inadvertently I know niggas wanna murder me

Staring so hard don't make me hurt that grill
Apologize nigga dog you ain't that real

Glass slipper wearin' ass niggas get killed
You ain't a grown man 'til you pay some bills
Keep it gully been pimpin' before I had 4 wheels

Flow so sick, them niggas can blow dick
Better analyze what lies before you trick
In the mix of some Queens niggas tryin to get rich
Any nigga in my way can feel the gun spit
Get your Du-Rag split with long four-fifth
Hand glide thru your hood in the six
Road call for my niggas who you wit? (Thug Shit)
Road call for my niggas who you wit? (Thug Shit)
Let it bang make it pop 'til your heartbeat stop
Know the game don't stop 'til the casket drops
The God run out of shots then they tape the block
Rep to the death for my carnivores on lock
And my dogs in the box meet you back on the block
You know how the team rocks, 'til we reach the top

Smack flames out a nigga and I got you smilin'
The way I cut a nigga every which way but loose
A blood stained Gucci suit will be the proof
Laid back cat but I love to chill
Love a freak in a thong with a ? full of ?
Said you went to catholic school and that's cool
Let me see you throw the suit on
With no interruptions, ma turn the cell off
Start for the touchin'
And I'm sick with the candle

I been through it
It's a first time for everything, settin you free
And I feel you your man ain't lettin' you breathe
You a dime from your face to your navel
Your man better wake the fuck up and let you out of that stable
Used to think like that until I thought
? shoe on the other foot and I got ?
Stay home, cook and clean like she the boss
Hell no nigga, not while I'm up in New York
She gonna do what she want, flirt when she want, fuck who she want
Then nigga It's a wrap

There's only one thing that this shit could lead to
The reaction, your mind'll crack
And put my mans on if it's poppin'
Bitch you laughin'?
Everything that I spit is real
And everything on your inside you scared to tell
The word creep, ""no"" ring a bell
Girl I know the situation all too well
I'mma keep it gangsta, rep the 'bout
Lady caught on, so I had to bounce
With bleach in the crib, all my clothes got doused
That's when a nigga knew I had to get out

Relationships now, it's like they got these laws
Girl all you wanna do is just be free

(Drop that shit) Yeah, yeah, check it out
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat, whatever
We can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24-7, mac 11 is my people
So why do you wanna end your little life like this?
Cause now you've bump heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive
The last night, damn right, I ain't tryin' to fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore
Ways of action, I grab the gat, then
Ain't no turning back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm like motion
No signs of anger or fear cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond

I put the drop on you kid, now I got you
You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do

Check it out, Check it out, Check it out, now

Fuck where you're at kid, it's where you're from
Cause where I'm from, niggas pack nothin' but the big guns
Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through fronting and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'm a point the finger, at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill but are you really real
Step to the hill and I'm a test your gun skills
Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a motherfucking short stay
Queensbridge, that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
6 blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you
With macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush
You thought that you could come around my way you beef, stupid fuck
What the hell you smoking? What the fuck possessed you
To come out your face, now I have to wet you
Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30, Cause I'm -

You got the heart to get busy without your crew?
Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do
You buckin' me, I'm buckin' right back at you

Straight up and down, Imma let you know now
You feel the gunshot bloaw from the Red Eye style
Now pass the owl and let me roll the method
Shit’s hectic while I’m cested, where’s the mic? Let me wreck it, check it
My rugged rhyme, lyrical design hit your spine
Every time that the Red Eye shine
Blinds the naked eye cause they can’t see through
The smoked screen behind the scene stands
 
the Red Eye crew
Now it’s true, my spiritual comes through my physical
Both connected by the method, therefore I’m lyrical
So what you gonna down I come to pursue
With my Tec 22 and infra red on you?
For real, my laser beam likes to see when I squeeze
I’m like a sniper when I strike you, steady busting from trees
MCs, you know my steez,
 I’m living trifle with the rifle
Punks I make them stifle feed they ass to my disciples

My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling
The game got him bugging, I trying to tell him slow down cousin
But he vexed and niggas getting wet up in the projects
But with no doubt, shortie's out for his respect
But is his brain insane from the lye?
From smoking that one eighteen tiny tye
Why, a nigga just died last week
As he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street
And it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack macs
His eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back
But I'm stressed and I need to be blessed
With a firepack, don't even go there cause it ain't like that
Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me?
You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me

Hit you up, take that cash, you ain't slug proof dude
Takin' yours to survive, it's only matter of time
I'm snatchin, livin' grimy, runnin', never look back
The root of evil got me actin' like that
Life ain't a game, the streets is mortal combat
I wasn't blessed with the silver spoon
Since my born, I was doomed, confined to one room
Now you's a customer
Cop it from natural born hustlas (that's what he thought kid)
Stupid son, you get extorted

Stop smilin, but still don't nothin' move but the money

Time is of the essence, and yours is runnin' out
Fast, you won't last, livin' out your life like that
You shoulda got down with my crew, slingin' cracks international
But instead, you wanna merge with the rivals
And moves like that could end up homicidal
You suicidal, and I'm (alive on arrival)
Play the drug game with precision, and never with division
I'm tryna see addition, food to fill my kitchen
Some faggot niggas snitchin' givin' info
We'll do a drive by, in a stolen black pinto
With tinted windows, bullets will flurry through your system
Your man ran, lucky for him, because we missed him
We'll catch him on the rebound, but see now
I'm tryna make this money and you tryna stop me, what's it gonna be now?
You stand up to my crew and get laid down
On the ground with the big four pound
You hear the sound on the other side of town
Where caps get peeled
Break you off, love, love, give you somethin' to feel

You don't have to tell me twice
I know when to chill when I have to
But if I have to, I'll still clap you
I'll crack through your fortress
You couldn't hold it down, so you lost it
No crew could withstand the forces
Never second guess me, just bless me
Stop smilin', bodies stackin', dead presidents pilin'
We wildin', lifted, terror three sixes
They got a petition, for my conviction
Rise to the occasion
When it's time for blazin', on the 41st side
Niggas is cravin' for beef, we can handle it
It ain't nothin' cause we use to it
It's all good, the hood we ran through it since young
It used to be candy, but now it's guns
Stickin' niggas son, my job ain't done

Stop smilin, but still don't nothin' move but the money

Paddyshop,The Infamous (Demo Tape),1994,"You can never understand the mind state
My goal is to increase the crime rate
And work at a fast pace, no time to think twice
Catch the fool blinkin' and he will be iced
For tryin' to play tough on the menu
But I can see the trick within you
I break it down to a science, word is bond
Nine times out of ten says you'll never see your life again
I'm ready to die, and ready for all y'all
If you think you ready to try to push the God to the limit
But I ambush and hit hard and bust shots in it
You didn't really want to get involved with a gunfight
Praying to God that you could live a long life
But I put the knife to your throat and proceed to cut
While you're bleedin' on the floor with your mouth shut
And what?

*scratches* Pumpin' mad slugs
All we do all day is
All we do all day
All we do all day is

Step through the door, gettin' set for '94
With the mind of Saddam, hardcore, bringin' war
So cock your pistol, I'm accurate like a Scud missile
I'll leave a cop killer lost in your brain tissue
Therefore, say no more, I'm the raw
Kid with skills, give you more than what you came for
My crew got my back so when you pop
This Glock kicks hollow tips, hittin' you up real quick
I chill on the hill, mind my own but still
Stay your point, keep my steel cocked and ready for real
I stay trife and walk the projects at night
Livin' right? Son, they want to take my life!
I'm paranoid, damn sure ain't the weed I smoke
It's the phony mother fuckers, while I'm on, they're broke
I see 'em starin', with their heat to try to get bold
Starin' at my gold, so the heat I hold tight like a mic
When I rhyme, commit crimes tonight
Threw a bid on my head? Pump lead
Leave your whole town red, bust a vessel instead
I choose, you lose when I squeeze
The enemies, them blow to fumes
Spark a L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black, Paddyshop, light it up

Big Noyd in the house, representin' Mobb Deep
Either smokin' a black or the bluey one-twoey
Lightin' it up, light the weed and make a cloud (x4)

You got a lot of heart boy, all that yappin'
Actin' like it can’t happen
It’s brothers like you who fail to realize the realness
So, now I got to deal with this
Back when I was younger, I used to get stuck
But now the tables turned and I make the beef duck
Quit stealin' all you who want to try and play me
I bet you if I hit you with the pound you’d obey me
You must be smokin' dust, my crew will flip for days
And bust your face open in various ways
I’m in too deep, ain't no if, what if, maybes
And if you got a kid then the P is killin' babies
And after that, relax and get puffed out
But watch your step 'cause you could still get rubbed out
Stop frontin', get a Tec to your grill
For real, you ain’t ill, I know the deal
Puff a fat L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black, Paddyshop, lightin' it up


I leave your brain in a faze, call me, dead
Your mind can’t find out project side, that’s when I climb out
Be on a flow in the Ac, the two, either one, two
Ay Black, that’s where they got that stay high
Keep my mind in the sky, straight are the corrupt
Front on this kid and you get bucked
Left stuck off the raps I kick, Queensbridge kid, you dig?
And rocks into the head, take a swig
I’m bent, stay hard, and if we bump into any shorties
All I want to know is if there’s any skins to barb
I live the high life, keep my mind right, do my dirt at night
Forget the pull, word is bond, it’s on
Queensbridge representin' with the automatic fullies
Weapons we pack, more cracks and flip G-packs
Get that loot kid, what you gonna do
When my whole crew is blazin' at you?
’Cause it’s whole crews we run through
I'm ill like Tommy Hill but brothers can’t figure the facts
Fake Jacks, you’ll get ten in your back
I react like a maniac, strapped with macs
It’s what the petty tip you on cause I'm not on it like that
I just chill, what the Hell? Everybody want to be a gangster
Step to Havoc and step into the Zone of Danger
They get blown with the banger
You been on a whore too long, a buck fifty flippin' on me
'Cause everywhere I go son, it’s time for me to flip
Loose lips ain’t shit, aim a nine and don’t miss
I learned to hold my own, protect my dome from beef
I’m quick to squeeze my piece, when the beef get deep
I get down for my crown in a minute
Wanna start drama; wants my gun? Imma end it!
And all this time, I been smokin' Drum, to relax my mind
I’m stressed like a motherfuck, niggas get bucked
On the ave, cause Queens niggas don’t give a fuck
And if you didn’t know by now, Queensbridge is where I’m from
The place that stars are born and phony rappers get done
Spark an L, burn a brain cell, love love

Eyes, ears open you can try to get close
Approach me then
Get on the floor soldier like you owe me ten

Rip shows, hit hoes
I'm the type of nigga that a have your baby father vexed
Whatever you say bounces off of me and right back to you
And if it get back to us then we clappin' you (what do)

Born to be wild, push to the front of the crowd
Top of the pile, state of the art rhymes a hundred miles
I lay down on chocolate clouds
Then pull out and let blow on any clown
Listen to the globe go round
'Cause my silence is the most powerfulest weapon yet found
Hold it down, my tongue that is, I bring the biz, keep it tight
My mouth piece dispense my clips
Fuckin' wit me, the scenery get highly intense
Intelligent, gun buckers, duck fucka, you get bent ova
I'm not signin' out soldier, rocket launcher
Shank musketeer, face carpenter
You need to downshift to slow down kid
Or get surrounded and pounded out, real quick
Hey yo check out what the storm blew in...


Check the main attraction of this rap shit
The Infamous slap some shit
On the track and get this whole atlas wide open
And stuck on it, you need to hang it up like a warnin'
Your shit borin', rap be pourin' on your head like its stormin'
Hell fire, Vietnam, your whole outfit get re-rounded
Yo you 'bout it, 'bout it, though I doubt it, doubt it
While you Girl Scout it I be reppin' QB drownin'
Boxes of Heinekens, gin bottles with the handles
Rubber handles, then crack paper
Gettin' flipped to stack paper
The beat's flavor make your pile more greater
Fuck y'all Mobb haters
We got y'all wives on the Beta, while you playin' wit her
We makin' her loose and turned on
She love when the thug is blowin', she get aroused
When I walk around with the gun showin'
The Mobb steady blowin' with this '9-8 shit
Before I had my clip, before I had my clique
A nigga wasn't shit
Y'all niggas wasn't feelin' this shit
Now you hearin' it, get off my dick
Y'all niggas sick like a virus
I wish one of y'all niggas try this...


The Mobb got it locked down
Still heavyweights and it's the VI
New niggas was shook, ain't it ill how we can read eyes?
No stoppin' this, it's approximate that you be coppin' this
Head lockin' shit bring it back where it's suppose to be
Take a dose of this, guarantee cats'll be stuck
Check the QBC just to cop from us
M O B B, make no mistake it's us
Thought it was hashish but the shit was laced with dust
You all fucked up, share the bread, no one to trust
Walkin' the streets with a bag o' choke and it's still Dutch
Rep the 41st side, I hold the title with pride and when it's on
Use the infrared for guide, aim it at your inner
I'm like liquor in the winter, keep it warm, but make things

Temperature’s Rising (Original Version),The Infamous (Demo Tape),1994.0,"Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
For a body - now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'mma put you on
It's all messed up somebody snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now just stay low
Once in a blue I check to see how you're doin
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they lookin for but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers, to get they thug on but oh well
Son they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh you heard who did what, no I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures - you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up your sheet so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyyo son, the temp is risin

The temperature's rising, and it's not surprising (x4)

What up black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga - gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide somewhere along the lines your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I used to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched it got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cause that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn - why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a - couple of years 'fore we see you around
Butt 'til then maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out, cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver - me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em
But still...",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-temperatures-rising-original-version-lyrics

Know what a chick want, know what a chick need
Recognize the difference from a male, and chicken feed

I'm having dreams of squeezing a gun that don't work
And some nigga with a tec come and wet my shirt
I catch bullets in my stomach, and them shits burn
I wake up sweating, holding my stomach cause it hurt
Yo, the shit seem too real, I'm dying of thirst
I gotta drink mad water just to calm me down first
'fore I get back to sleep, and get some rest
Then I can't get back to sleep, I'm too stressed
I got the shotty real close, right under my bed
I know that work, cause I been practicing
With my gauge at the range, nigga I'm nice with it
Nigga mothafuck them dreams, I'm real life with it
You'll be coughin up your spleen, guts and all kinda shit
You invade my space, I'm beating the case
Nigga come fucking with me, yeah that's my kinda shit
Please, or all of my guns'll be a waste

But when they try, they gonna get popped in the motherfucking head
At point blank range I treat a cop like chump change
And splatter his fucking brain
The insane paragraphs of payin the tax, shoot on
Keep a griz .20 for a bag of bugga
You know my style I gets buck-motherfucking-wild
Rock a cop and put a bitch nigga on trial
So know the smooth, keep my cool, when I peep 'em
Jet on the roof till them fuck death, I don't need 'em

To kill 'em off till there ain't one badge alive
Shorty fillin with a attitude (yeah)
And I be damned if you ever find a better dude
Peep it, I'm lettin off five shots, for any five cops
That wanna step up and get that ass drops
And it's on with the cops in my neighbourhood
The buck motherfuckers ain't no good
I know a herd cop when I see 'em
Call his bluff if he think he tough enough to walk my streets
Or shoot a fair one at 'em one time
Grab his night stick and beat his ass down till he's flat line
And now I'm up to my knees in police blood
In the projects, so which cop is next?

So step up cop and act like you want it
Little niggga who done it, cause I was blunted

And let you know they wanted fifty-four elevens from the door
We cut school, cooked caine, took traum' to the brain
And though a nigga had it, still hopped the fuckin' train
Look back and laugh but ain't shit funny still

Got friends with chemical imbalances

Seein' you have to suffer, just wanted to comfort not turn into lovers
That shoulder you could lean on, I know shit got you stressin'
The kids askin' for daddy, they keep askin' the question
Came around to check up on y'all, I know my homie do the same
Guilty like a motherfucker, how we get into this thing?
That love shit is real, is all that wrong?
People lookin' at us like we crazy
Now we spend nights on the phone all night long
Got so much in common, this shit is crazy
It's more than just physical 'cause mentally you stimulate me
And if I ain't up on it, baby, you just educate me
And vice-versa, that's what we both in search of
Want to love and get it, somebody that we could nurture
Is it wrong?

How can we love when we love
If this love is never supposed to be
Livin' lies that the truth could see
So now tell me love, can we love
If we know this love can't be this way
Let's keep this love low",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-low-lyrics

You niggas always startin somethin
And beefin with rappers, why our music so violent
And so dramatic, where's the love?
Why y'all go so much static
Is it real for real or all for sales?
I'm like, ""Shorty you must be sick""
We been gettin burned like the Waco kids
I don't need to diss rappers for recognition
You better check the files: Infamous, Hell on Earth, Murda Muzik
You can't be SE-RIOUS
We created this drama shit, we set the trend
We taught you niggas bout diamonds and guns
And numerous ways we choose to earn funds
We veterans, we got a decade of albums
Niggas done came and went, and we still poppin
Our name is carved in stone
Even the new blood know, we ain't no joke so

Let us solidify this - what's that?
We been solidified this - but of course!
Lot of new rappers and young kids - uh-huh
They all love +The Infamous+ - but of course!

Won't sweat if I lose, bet your ass won't live

Hit your mans up if they press the issue
Some dead, the other half crippled, and I'm a monster with led
Lodge a slug in your abdomen, puts in the 7

Get it twisted and you WILL get twisted with chrome biscuits
Make no difference my nigga, we handle business
So please with the questions they right in, front of your face
Homey stunt he gettin to' from the gate, so


Nigga that you used to click with turned on you
Idiots you used to rap with hatin on you
Did you really get juxed for half a mill' in jewels
At the video shoot? I tell you this boo-boo:
My stick-o's still my stick-o
My stick man be my stick man 'til the tombstone (mmm, mmm)
You got rhymes? You got stomach for the Mobb?
You got stomach for P? I get my rocks off
Believe nothin that you hear and only half of what you see
Niggas never cooked in the kitchen and never clapped heat
Niggas wanna be thugs but on the inside so sweet
Niggas butchers on they records, but they never handle beef
Know nothin bout golden seal, seein your P.O
Gave a dirty urine now you're snuffin a C.O
Fuckin right, I'm a man of the people but I will kill you

I hit skins, light up, and then I smoke a Phil'
You don't want a beef with this juvenile delinquent
I'm not good, I'm livin like a hood
And when I kick MC's abandon ship
Cause my brain is the sun of a solar eclipse
Yo, Havoc is the man that you have to bring
Cause I'm flippin like pages in a Word Up magazine
Sweet like candy, the poetic vigilante
So explicit even porno flicks ban me
And girls gel me like jheri curl activate

Brain cells overload when I'm thinkin
This is a rap rape, and I leave a fat taste
Get off the microphone kid, stay in a child's place
I cook you up, like Uptown raw base
And leave you open like if you just saw Scarface
Like I said it before, shorty scores, I get raw
For the cause, battle me, take a loss
I steal shows like BelBivDevoe's

And in my pocket is crazy fat bag of buddha

Money don't fake moves cause I probably hit your sister
I'm on a mission word is bond

Outta luck, never took the time to wish
Took a bitch down then I'm out like quick

Trife Life (Original Version),The Infamous (Demo Tape),1994.0,"It's just another day, drowning my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this bitch ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
I put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see, we
Jetted thru Marcy cause D's ain't bagging me
Word Son, they got us on the run, dun, see yo

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me livin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know

OK check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the Bridge
You ain't really sweating it, cause little do you know
The niggas in the Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe and tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting, kid you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide, no days
Son get the heat, cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo if that nigga front, yo hit him!)
Aight bet, so just hold me down
While I cock back the long three-pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprised
""What's goin' on?"", as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that we're juxing, if you got what we like you gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making cheese by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessey, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me but never ever find shit
It's the every day, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, move ki's
But all the bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger if the drama appears
Cause a nigga's worst enemy is fear
So yo....

Check it out, check it out, check it out, yo
The trife life got me thinkin' like an animal
No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt so
What can kill you is what you don't know

Your childhood, ideals crushed, youth press due
And stuffed that, basically just go fuck your ass up
You a volcano about to erupt, running the corrupt guns shiny
But them basketball trophies covered in dust
Them babies kids, the innocent that was lost in
Not them, circumstances, and had that hand forced
When I was little, yeah I dreamt of the Porshe, and of course
Ain't get it, admitted, them loose rocks, the only source
To that shit that rob and lease, preech the riddle was in reach
God, give me one last word, to kill her

But it's beat the other nigga, getting killed tonight

Some things'll never change

Make a nigga say, fuck birthday, and fuck Christmas
Fuck a wishlist, I'm writing out my shitlist
It got a lot of names, I got a lot of time
Blow out brains, see now you out your fucking mind
You get gauged, for a pound of the wicked nine
You playing games to the sound of them guns fire
Cereal and powdered milk, that was then then
A-1 Sauce sandwiches, we was children
Growing up broke, snatching chains and coats
Smoking weed with coke, selling fiends soap
Drunk sleeping on the bench, I couldn't make it upstairs
Woke up and seen the kids on they way to school, shit
Borrow money for my drug dealing friends
So I can buy beer, yeah that'll put me on my feet again
See, this real shit, you probably never been through
Ching-ching, now I got bling, but..


Back to back, nigga, just getting knocked
Since swallowing the pack, guess what? His heart stopped
It all happens in the hood, it never seems to stop
And even the good ones, get drugs planted by them dirty cops

Back to back, niggas be getting shot

Step in to my highrise hell
You gots to be on the up and up
Watch your back, pump your crack
But don't forget to re-up
A burner's your God and you pray to it all day
Then at night, you catch a body
But it's just the shit you got to do
Cause if you wasn't watchin, they'd catch your ass too
You gotta go all out if you want props
Or you can just kill a man, and it's the same for cops
Now you want a little fame from the drug game
Whether you shoot em up, or pump cracks, it's all the same
But fuck it you're in it to win it
Fat uptown, cookies in the rocks, your spot's hot
Now you're livin the life of a project sad song
Makin your loot from all the right wrongs
But that's the way it goes when you choose your path
And you might just, feel the pain of a tec 22 blast
All out war, with niggas from the next block
You're pullin out the Glock, to shut em down
Now you're Mr. Big Shot in your tribe
Niggas know your name from Mt. Vernon, to Southside
Comin from the streets of Fright
Where the only thing you'll know is how to roll it up right
And load it up, tight, you're startin a block war
Nigga pull the trigga if you want a little more
Frank Nitty style, buckwild
Thirty-eight slugs from uptown thugs
No question, you're true to the game
Since the age of a little Brand Nubian
From skelly tops to props ? and all that
Now you're puttin your block on the map
A role model to the petty drug dealers
Banana clip style, my neighborhood's buckwild

See you later maybe sooner in the project hallways

Pull the trigger, pass the 40 in the project hallways
Runnin through the doorways, back in the days
Just a little snot nosed bastard
Always causin' havoc, with a blade
But now it's a burner, used, for murder
Step a little closer and your ass is grass
You better move fast 'fore I kick that ass
Cause I'm sharp like glass, but I won't break
Walk into the project hallways is your big mistake
You little bitch ass nigga, you shoulda known better
You'll get done, did, a kid from the 'Bridge
Who gets buck, and couldn't give a fuck about your daze
I'm talkin bout the project hallways
Catchin bodies in the project hallways
Project hallways, chillin in the project hallways
To survive around my way
You gotta play a knuckle game every day
Lost in the shuffle of hardrocks
And knocks on the streets of the uptown blocks
Load the Glocks, who got the mox'

Move, what? I never lose

Charge the brain, lick em up, that's the name of the game
So it's the move when I move little smooth
On the motherfuckin mission and I just improve
Upstairs, niggas dyin on the 6th floor
Cause in the projects, shit is mad rough
So take a puff and relax your mind
J.V. crimes, most of the time
You might catch my crew, with a sixty-four brew
Watch your back, cause we're comin through
With a fat sack of 1-2-1 son
And the shit ain't fun, unless I get some
Of the action, little shorty execute

So Long,Infamy,2001.0,"Why the fuck did your your ass have to go and get knocked
Now you got me on the phone, straight talkin' to the cops
Tryin' to verify your government
They got you now, they lovin' it
They wanna hang that ass, couldn't get you in the past
Though I can't see your problem
You was still young at the time
Did a lot of older things, you was ahead of your time
Never told you to slow down
Resee your crown heights, you wild
All I could say was be careful
Give you a dap to bounce
Shit that you went through
Watched the drama amount
Gave a fuck long, you wasn't part of the body count
Now I feel guilty, half the blame of your incarceration
Till the interveine, when you first started catching cases
Fuck to this, dunn, now you in there
Gotta hold it down, you mother's only son
And I'mma ride for you, baby, cause a lot of it is still love
I'm still there, when you get home, I'mma be there
Chorus: Havoc (4x)
You gotta (hold on)
No matter (how long)
And it seems (so long)

I can't believe they got my dunn, it feel like my fault
Cause I fronted you that money to get that dough
Any man's ain't accountable for they action
Still and all I feel responsible for you being gone
I hit the mall 'till it happened, k.a. now & then
Just so, you can live and keep your little cosmetics
In that five years, it was a little dough we made
Out of sight, out of mind, naw dog
It's not me, I miss you
You on my mind daily
Even though I scribe to a nigga, really, you feel me
Trying to get my shit together
So you could be proud, when you touch down
We got businesses to run now
Peep it back how we used to run up in a nigga's house
On some pety crime shit, boy we was not playin'
On occassion, I still check ya, brotha 'tll the end
Black, and bone crazy ass
Reading ya letters, I see you ain't losin' ya sense of humour
Talkin' to you on the phone made my day cooler
Tellin' me, how you'll deaf, to see your nose out
You need to bring your black ass home
And cut that bullshit out
I could remember me and killa would test our new guns in the projects
Cause that's where police won't come, Illa Ghee
My nigga 'till death do us
You almost home, until then
Hold ya head, dunn

Pushin' to the limit like Montana did
Army bags full of money, bullet proof this
And that too, put some in the roof
Niggas be shootin' from windows, we untouchable
Yea we is rich thugs, that shoot up clubs
Make albums that click more than little drugs

Out of there before the siren, bounce, dismantle your iron
Lost count how many times, I had these bitch niggas flyin'
Give a fuck, shoot his ass, for the littlest thing
The principal, minuscule, my gun is still ring
You ain't flippin' nuttin', makin' cheddar, y'all niggas broke
Broke guns, broke dunns, y'all got jokes
Yea I'mma hammer like a fiend, when he need it, let it smoke
When you bitches act up, it relax even more
Pretty sure niggas know they don't - don't put 'em all
When they finally figure it out, his slow ass gone
Yea you runnin' with 'em, dime with 'em, try to switch teams
And get your motha'fuckin' head blown off clean

Throw pills back and one swallowed
Smoke the whole dutch with three poles and keep me from stretchin'

Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin'
Look down and see dry blood all on my garment
It stained up my Guess formers, Kevlar'd enormous
I hopped up outta my bed holdin' my head
Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head
I can recall an eight man brawl, three men fall
Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?

For every rhyme I write recites every day life
Queensbridge streets at night even more trife
Hold me down son, never let sleep, danger lurk
Niggas creep, doing they dirt never in peace
By my self foreverly bent, pores leaking with the foul liquor scent
Losing track of loot I spent, but ain't no time for that
It's '96 get on point like a motherfucker similar to pyramids
You listening? Eh yo, its on like that
You know the saying: Once you bust gat no turning back
Pop you, till they drop and it there ain't no stopping
Hit em up, fill them with the slug toxin

Pass the heat to the clique, assist like John Stockton

Grab a hold of this grip tight like its your last bit

Overminding, my Mobb done did it again
Vertical raps straight up and down
My wolf pack 'll go at the whole globe attack the map
Ambassador P, with strengthly, strip your sleeve of your stripes
You're branded for the rest of your life
Now you can sit back and cherish the time that we spent
A foul memory of timb boots, rights and lefts and razors
Your face get open from B.I
Maniac niggas get clapped and sent to triage
The story of my life, crew got shot, stabbed with knife
Make a weapon out of anything and take your life
Violence follow me like the bitch from Fatal Attraction
It seems I attract drama so action

Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in 2000)

Never too complex to where it fly
Over the heads of 85, I strive
To stay real and keep hip-hop alive
Revive thoughts collide, you better slide I advise
You keep the eyes on the prize, my metal rips
Militant minded like the prejudice, devils I shatter
This march was meant to spark a million diligent hearts
Or e'rylife, we even see alike so play your part

Knowledge equality, born gods can follow me
As we swarm the yard like bees out in D.C
The TV'll televise the revolution for sellin lies
Within the constitution, realise the former solution
October 16th, a million black minds comin intertwined
On the fact find
Lord Jamal, black Jesus and I stack rhymes
But the black-on-black crime that attack mine

Right here, hanging with my brothers and we showing no fear
So where you at y'all?
Right here, if you representing then throw your hands in the air

Hear my synopsis, I drop this
Generates thoughts of born-awareness of the here-and-now
Buildin a poem with many spearin out
Society inflaws unjust laws remain the voided common cause
Equality rules you to love that equality, many's law to trust this
Act of the devil possess the sword of justice
Take the devil's head thru levels nad
Bad truth can spread to mental dead

Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth, most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus

When I catch rays thru the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves

Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall of the ledge
And blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

As we struggle in the jungle of sin, my thoughts are militant
Destroyin the ignorance, buildin the innocent
Teachin infants infinite knowledge
That wasn't taught in high schools or college
My representation is with the 30 million man destination
Washington, D.C., war with the masons
The only celebration is Satan's elimination
The past education at the present is relevations
The future's our creation, elevation of the nation

So where you at y'all?
Right here, if you representing then throw your hands in the air

Yo around Red (16) October

Killin warrior soldiers in D.C., you face Jehovah all over
The darkside, I ride tracks to provide
Elementive intelligence while you fake MC's hide
(Left, right!) as I command all my sons cos I'm grand
(Pull his head, snatch land) See if I slide thru the sand
Snakin those who choose to fake moves on Zoo, ya get bruised
(Bring ya crew) Opposin the chosen son of God, you get scarred hard

Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene nahmean?
But I've been knockin em out the box like saltines
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
And mould me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use intergration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'mma get it or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart with the million man march

Don't even make eye contact, walkin
Dunn, pay attention that's how niggas die sooner
Watch who you pass and it might be a reaper
Watch my niggas we'll jump when you least thought
We came from the streets up, now we put G's up, so
Chorus

Yo, had time to think when just on the brink of death
At my front door me receivin slugs?
Only twenty-five, got fifty more to go
And knows, their plot I hope they ass die slow
How though no dough, please don't show
Like my man Twist said don't even see me when I blow
Got, issue with my foes best believe I'ma solve em
And laugh at your petty-ass problems

Out the slums of Queens, came a bunch of young gun niggas
The Infamous Mobb Deep
With dreams, of one day makin it big
With they Live Nigga Rap music, hard liquor swigs
Dirty Timbs, thirsty grins
Smile all up in your face then I break your chin
Went platinum, now them niggas writin scripts
Murda Muzik the movie, pushin spaceships like..

Bone your chick, push whips, invest shit
If I wreck shit, cop the next shit then make a right on red
Handle business, do shit, confuse the feds
Never lose my head, push your wig instead

And when it happens
Off guard watch reaction (Watch his reaction)
Look him in his eyes, cock back, commence clappin
And it could happen to you

It's old love, I could see the eyes up above
Watchin, waitin for me to slip
Lose grip, opposition got me on their list
I get freshed by Jase
He threw all the fakes
I want my cake and eat it too
Wash it down with brews
Spent a half a milli on gats
You know the drilli
Smack em all buster silly, got dough on the philly
And store-willies, it's the NY City
Hazardous, dangerous game of da
Sticky motherfucker keepin undercover
Stick-n-move, Gators to Timb shoes
Jeans to tuxedos
Second motion, son, I be do
Down below ya best

Freeze the counter, ???? and powder

Resco his cool piece, too grimy now ya death row
To test smokes, hazardous the most
Slow you up like dust
Coke white you get crushed
You modernise
Infamous come through like the homicide
Hit guys, rip Dons, get mines, the thin line


Infamous who rap shit, power moves and connect wit
Empire, bless all my sons wit
Bank accounts
Many mansions down south
Fuck ABT, got protected
War strategies perfected
Bent all day, Alize party
Golf, fuck par 3, pimp, pusher, playa, couldn't be me
Hennessey raps, fully loaded with gats
Now how you like that
Time lapse
You lose, shoulda been strapped!
Be on your back like a new born
Niggas is corn-born, wit
Real cats who do this all day long
On and on til the break of dawn, it don't stop
Shit is hot like PJ's infested with cops
Jakes on a nigga ass, ninja break em like glass
Interrogated, they won't last
Would it make you laugh or make you cry?
On this side it's do-or-die
Ya get dead plus sun-dried, you're small fry
We on time with this, mace blindin shit
Gold mindin it, extended 9 clips
Trife life got my mind keyed up
Pull out the Tek-nology and team-o

Can't beat ya gat, can't find ya crew

Shit Hits the Fan,The Infamous Archives,2007.0,"God damn, nigga left bleeding with his head in his hands
Wishing that he never crossed fam
And but still niggas like that get left slain
Found days later on the ave in a can
We used to dance all night my main man
We used to give each other pounds wit da webs of our hands
Its a click thing, yall niggas wouldn't understand
We used to get off loose cracks and bag grams
Hold each other down, duckin the blue van
The d's on the roof, plus the 6-Y cab
Who'd ever thought u was a snake in the grass
One of my stash whip and keys to my lab
You wanted me shot dead, some things you can't have
I pulled out the 8, when you almost got stabbed
We followed the same path, cryed and shared laughs
Now I can't wait, for the day to see your bloodbath
Plug dat, fill you up wit slugs rat take that...

They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit the fan

They never think shit stank, till shit hit the fan
Niggas don't think shit stank, till shit hit them

I'm in a benz for stealth, thinkin on plans
Stopped at a red light, the birds like damn
I saw one whisper to the other, thats him
That MOB nigga I think he platinum
Pulled to the next corner hopped out and asked them
If they knew directions to rhode island
We was in East New York, they thought I was wildin
Its a click thing they wouldn't understand
Meanwhile I looks to my left and see some niggas frownin
As if they was go flip now peep this
I'm writin shorties math on the trunk of the Six
The bitch wanna blow dick cause its deep dish
These niggas wanna twist me because of my necklace
I'm calm though you know I got the stash in the whip
I clap though, these niggas better blast very quick
They coming towards me, I sat in the passenger seat
Reached underneath, grabbed the big Fifth
Acting like I'm not knowing whats happenin
I'm still havin conversation with these hens
I'm bout to have a confratation with these mens
I know I'm going home wit my chain and my head
Yall won't dead me, I sleep in my own bed (pop pop pop pop pop)

 Can't fuck with us!

Aiyyo Hav', it's on man!
Bout to shut this bitch down {*NON STOP*} knahmean?
Yeah man aiyyo yo yo
Okay sit up straight in your seats, pay attention now
We teach you niggas some things about this lifestyle
We live, plus eat sleep and shit
Stash box in the crib, we doin this to death
Throw a matchbook at your wiz, after we finish
One gasoline bath, man that bitch fried chicken
Homey that's what you get when you fuck with my niggas
We dumpin your Roley pop loose and we ain't even want it
Niggas hearts get took, and that's how we on it
Put that bullshit to rest, and never dwell on it
Got me sittin on the toilet, takin a shit
With my gun in my hand cause a nigga cautious
Got the hammer on me, gettin searched by police
Takin chances, I'd rather that than be a lawsuit
In the jungle they pick opportunities to touch you
Send you home horizontal in a box comfortable

You thugs couldn't handle the thugs I run with
Ain't got enough slugs for the guns we bust with
All y'all niggas is herbs in our eyes for real
Niggas wanna talk gangsta?  You see me when you get killed

Why should I remind y'all, that niggas 'ready know
Mobb is instinct with that ready blow, homey
Want drama {*BANG!*} then slugs I let 'em go (yea yea)
Rapid fire on that ass with a steady flow the hammer's
On standby victory's a landslide, fuck's my name?
Havoc and I bring that shit e'ry game
I got game for a bitch, leave a baby on her lip
Leave my mark in your town from that thing on my hip
Give a fuck who you go and get, now get this
Niggas wanna swim I drown 'em in they own SHIT (shit)
Blood and piss, she pretty I'ma thug the bitch
And never fall in love with it (nah)
Catch me, merkin the 7 with the limo tint
Alone I'm an armed forced, I'm so militant
With the pound in the stash box, getcha the lip

So Ill,Blood Money,2006.0,"Man, I been fucked up for so long and now I'm rich
All the other broke niggas that I used to fuck with
Got that look in their eyes, got that scheme on their face
When I pop up around the way, like shit changed
Look here, don't make me put your brains on display
You niggas never really gave a fuck about P
Now it's all about me and why I don't break bread
Where do he sleep and how can we break in
Is he in his Jeep or maybe it's the Porsche
Naw, let's catch him in the V and tear the nigga all up
No, I don't think so
I'm all in my mirrors and out my windows
I get up out the car with the Desert Eagle
Shorty don't like me, said I got an ego
So she tell niggas they should stick me
Gassing niggas up to make history
So, they take the jux so they can make the books
But I bang the heat when they came for me

Niggas think they so ill
'Til you make a little blood spill
Now you punk-ass niggas know
Fucks with me, it's a must you bleed
Niggas think they so ill
'Til you make a little blood spill
Now you punk-ass niggas know
Fucks with me, it's a must you bleed

Catch me, New York cruising, sticking and moving
Smoking that sour diesel on point every time that I blew it
Now scheming on me is foolish, don't think about it, just do it
I put you through it like that hurricane that ran through Houston
You ain't shooting, you ain't scaring nothing, y'all just flukes
Rob a nigga, strip his ass down to the birthday suit
I never pick grapes, but I cut me a bunch
I'm that nigga in the club watching your ass get duffed
Niggas want to hang up once they find they got war with us
And they baby mama slutting out there on tour with us
Pass it to the homie once a nigga get bored with her
Almost couldn't nut because your ass keep calling
And dude fronting, come on, baby, you ain't got them guns
All you got is that rusty ass revolver, son
And you can't fool me, I know they borrowed, nigga
Niggas think that they ill but the Mobb is iller",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-so-ill-lyrics

That's what we here for
But umm.. we gon' take this little intermission
To say what the fuck we got to say, y'know?
(let me, let me here something then)
It's like this dunn
Infamous til the name wear out
Time and again without doubt
I take the murder one route
Why clowns pulled out and copped out
Poppin they, little heads out they hole
Stickin they chest out, actin like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin this since we was kids
And all you other niggas gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggas got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a tru to life nigga like P
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like anigga livin street life
How to chasee down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga til he throw up
Straighten up there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And i'ma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin
Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck wit the god
Pee wit a capital ""p""
And don't ever in your life try to rock wit me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top
I, splash the half ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long
My shit came out and you got escorted to the door
You just a fuckin clown here to entertain us all
I bring the gravity dunn you're gonna fall
Anytime y'all niggas wanna mic brawl
Don't forget to me it's bloodsport bring your dogs

You just frontin wit imaginary pies you flip
Aiyyo pee my mind and yours put together's like a pack wild pirahnas
Carnivores it's me thirstin

While your catch me on your networkin, you dick jerkin

The infinite Infamous man its like we never
Fall short fall off or fall back
Theres never been a team in the history of rap
With this guinness book level of intelligent hard shit
Only thing the game missing is more of this mobb shit
The strippers dance on poles on them strip songs
But in the car on the way home she puts on
Some good ol' Hav and P
Its back to the real world back to reality
 X2
Anything that can be done I do it better
Anythings possible I can do whatever I chose
Life is what you make it
I chose my own path, life is what you make of it

Life is what you make it, some brothers never make it
In this lifetime, 
I saw my little brother die
Now he up in the heavens, know he watching over me
Said fuck the world so I put it in the ovaries
And fow that I would make it, out the ghetto
And do my best at every level
They say you hate with nine fools you end up the tenth one
Had them haters on my back with no relent son
But I stuck to the script; never wave it
Waiting for that moment that I could save her
All I had to do was believe that I was greater
Know that I was greater
I put everything else in the hands of my creator
Then reminisce 20 years later
How we was getting it
, still is touring the world
Cake
Life is what you make it

It’s Over,Free Agents: The Murda Mixtape,2003.0,"Yeah.. uh-huh
Y'all niggas ain't ready to die
Why the fuck they frontin like they is?

Aiyyo Dunn, aiyyo yo
You could catch P laid back, in triple black trucks
Or catch him swingin pain(?) bottles in the club
Won't catch me with the police without cuffs
Can't press me into no threatenin position
Probably spot me, steppin out the tree spot tough
Catch P fixin his pants, it's cause of his gun
You see the God, big ol' chains, but can't stick him
Cause they know I shoot niggas like Slick Rick and them
Source at the thug events, y'know we hittin them
Caught him spendin fake hundreds at the bar, we was gettin them
Drugs in my system, all types of shit
Keeps me where I wanna be, don't get me started on that
Just peep how aggressive my niggas is with this
And check how we set up shop to get our chips
Niggas study our verse like college kids (word)
We know you love our style, get off our dick
(Yeah that's right, uh-huh)

 Y'all niggas ain't ready to die
Why the fuck they frontin like they is?
 Cause they wanna be like the reals
And be amongst the thugs that do this for real
 Y'all niggas ain't ready to die
Why the fuck they frontin like they is?
 Cause you wanna do it like Hav'
And do it like P, but mad shit missin

Y'all niggas is pussy, and ain't nothin gangsta in ya
Rapid fire empty the clip, reload and continue
If not anything else the four-pound'll spin ya
And end you where you stand (uh-huh) dead you cause I can
Believe me my hammer don't give a damn what you been through
It's a cold cold world, my whole life was a winter
Never gave a fuck about the cold (nah) draped in thermal
Don't put your nose in things don't concern you
This grown man business, y'all niggas so childish
I'm in the cut, analyzin while you fools is wildin
Pickin my mark, and I'mma clap my heat off the grip
Murder so clean you can eat off the shit
I'm a paranoid nigga, don't get too close
Or I might think you schemin on me, I'm cockin the toast
The game cutthroat so I killed the ref

Let’s Pop,Free Agents: The Murda Mixtape,2003.0,"Niggas in the club, get it poppin', why not?
Bag a little chick, spend a little, if she's hot
When you in the guts, be sure to hit the g-spot
From the back or the front, or the side, let's pop

Fly vibe, I take it, light skinned, I take it
Brown skin, I wake with, hand it up, and scrape it
Get it straight explicit, have a broad all naked
Eat up, head game, well perfected
Grail eater, hit the breaks, ma, swell the speed up
I made trick a little, but never bless no skeezers
Plus when I rip, I laminate my dick like Visa's
Quick to jump it off, on the beaches, the bleachers
And premiere features, moanin' sounds like creatures
Get up in your guts, have me screwin' up your features
I love them thick ones, that suck like leechers
Take it to the game, so we can fuck in the nose bleeders
Hemy on the rocks, grown women swallowin' cock
Made a nigga blast off on the fox
When I pop up one of fox shit, like Vicica Fox
Topless in the drop, straight, lettin' me rock


Girlfriend, slide with me
And I'mma show you how life should be
I'm a definite, them other cats is possibilities
It'll be evident, when she rock with me
Know you heard it all before, that nigga that claim he balls
In the club, with his car keys showing
A creep from behind, I know you tired of them
Wanna suck up on them thighs, say goodbye to ya friends
Yeah, your visions blurred, I'mma clear ya lens
Show you a whole new world, as I guide you in
Don't let nobody steer you wrong, you look fly in Timb's
A sneak fuck is the best, love your devilish grin
Ya man worry where the fuck you been?
You ain't a child, I don't see no rings, do ya thing
Baby girl, not to sound like their's hate in my blood
But you know the rules, ya bitch chose me, cuz


Whoadie, you got ass for days
I'm try'nna get between them legs, dub my way
Through that slimey hallway, your walls make me
Claustraphobic, I knock 'em down, aye!
Shorty you look like the type to say
Go easy on me, slow down, I can't take it
That's a cute little outfit, but I picture you naked
Sweatin' buckets, while I'm fuckin', like I hate it
Dancin' on me, that fatty girl, what's happening girl
I step to my business, and put my g. in early
Wait til them drinks and that weed we burnin'
Hit, and watch how I make my way to that pussy
It's a gangsta's ball, we havin' a blast
I got one ho in my front, and one on my back
I got another ho on my right, and one on my left

Killaz Theme,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro / Mobb Deep):
Ha ha...
Yeah...
Uh huh right...
Part the crowd like the Red Sea...
Let's fight to this...
Don't even tempt me...
(Chorus / Mobb Deep):
We want to kill you... (make y'all niggas fight to this)
We want to kill you...
(Prodigy):
Eh yo
Peace to our way of life
Hats off to all the trife
Let's toast to fully autos and foot long knives
Specially for stacks of green packs
My outfit ah perform, so blow all stained raps
Now let me take y'all niggas back to my basics of this
Ya ancient to flip, fag catch a face lift
My shank do remarkable things for fakeness
My whole Mobb got the same patience
Throw on your tracks 8-6
And make moves like a space ship
We pack places, Infamous bangs ya nation
Ya light at the weight station
That weak shit need replacing, put this in heavy rotation
Overdose music
It's theraputic to the user
Driving wild under the influence of this
Careful, 'cause ya might just crash ya shit
Total ya whip and still pull my tape out the deck
Me and Mobb tryin to connect like thirty thousand dollar links
Unpoppable, unstoppable, topple
(Cormega):
Yo, my drug cliental was bringing me money well
Smoking Buddha L's and weed so good
They leave a funny smell
Niggas scoping me, hoping police is close to me
Mega regulatin'
The way shit's supposed to be
Gold chain choking me, cocaine provoking me
To live my destiny (ha)
Jacuzzi water soaking me
Floating in smoky Durango
Doing my thing yo, my mac milli
Sweeter than a mango
Son, you know the drilly
The drama is a part of me
Did time for cocaine, nines and armed robbery
My rhyme written graffiti is a live nigga prophecy
Mega poetic rhymes are like dimes but no credit
I leave ya mind paralysed dun, but don't wet it
Scarface persona, I acquired a taste for drama
And I embrace this, real shit
You banned from the projects
Your love here, ancient (fuck that)
Yo, I'ma see you
Nigga, you transperant see through
Rhymes fully automated, you semi crime related
Cormega and Mobb Deep rhyme amazing
Thug shit you can't fuck with...
What!!!
(Havoc):
Fuck ya bullshit rep, nigga you ass bet
Talking all that shit, don't even got cash yet
I floss, try to get away
No gats tossed
Got drama with my click, I'ma take it to the source
Q.B.C. representative, I'm just trying to live
If I can't get to you, I'ma take it to ya kids
Spray ya crib, fuck it son
Something gotta give
If I can't live then ain't nothing gonna live
That's dead ass
But to put this whole shit in a smash
You real, hit that ass up on four wheels
All jokes aside, you goin' squeal like them other rappers
You know we kick the truth, you want to clap us
I got this, strictly out the mouth nothing but hot shit
Pop shit, you couldn't fuck this when we drop shit
You helpless, put your whole shit outta service
Put on some old shit (Thank God for this)
Yo, if it wasn't
Them niggas like us, you just be ash dust
Hustling for petty kid cash
Come on know, you know I know
When it comes to gats, I'ma a hoe
Never bite my tongue, let them player haters know how we coming
Straight coming through while you running
Get done-ed, have that ass shaking like a bitch when she coming
One in a mil, slip that ass like a mickie
It's fifty-fifty fucking with this, nigga just come and get me
No doubt...

Trippin' with one in the head and two clips
Poppin' shit because your man got hit

Itinerary,UnKnown,UnKnown,"At the end of the road turn right
After 80 meters turn right
Then take the second left
Go right on the roundabout first exit
Turn around when possible

Yo listen, they wanna set me up, uh huh, grab me up
They can’t take it how i make it, stay being bucked
Truth be told, they beneath me, let’s be honest
Cause I be switching up the scenery like from the projects
To the Kremlin, the Hong Kong skyline
He’ll never get a turn, it’s always my time
Find another skill, hip hop is mine
The only reason you rap is cause you heard my rhymes
You wasting good drug money on studio time
You better off buying clothes, get fresh, right
You suck, turn that bullshit off
You ain’t got no Mobb Deep in your iPod
You ain’t got no Don P, your whole life wrong
This the best of the best, turn the lights on
You need to see what the fuck is going on
I’m the main event,  the great wizard of bars


I’ve been riding down that road for a minute
Speeding in and out of lanes pushing it to the limit
But the journey’s not finished
Part away from P to handle my own business
I met a fork in the road
Which way to go? I’m all for the dough
It’s money over hoes, bullet for the skull
Fucked up when you gotta put your dreams on hold
And your homies don’t see the bigger picture like you do
Trying to navigate to a city that I outgrew
Fuck the world ‘cause they doubt you
Hear your enemies, but watch them niggas that’s around you
100 MPH, getting closer to the exit
Heard you took it off cause I’m on to some next shit
Am I headed in the right direction?
Only God knows, but I count my blessings


I got the pedal to the metal doing about a 100
Jake in the rearview, sirens going
Red and blues flashing, life is on high speed
Only thing that slow me down this blunt and some good trees
But it’s hotter than a pancake
That’s life’s struggle, it is what you make it
But me I’m about the paper like a ticket
It’s all about the dough, fuck the speed limit
Stacking change, stay in your lane
Don’t rub a neck, keep your eyes on your own thing
Check your blind spot before you make moves
Whether left or right, nigga, watch what you do
Cause a wreck could happen in a sec
Pushing it too hard, you end up in treeyards
See me, I stay strapped like a safe-belt
He tucked under the seat, that’s how we roll


After 100 meters, make a U-turn
Then at the end of the road, Turn right
After 200 meters - sharp left
Then, you have reached your destination
You have reached your destination",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-itinerary-lyrics

Ayo, nigga I don't shoot cars up or dawgs up
That shit I did when I was sixteen, word up!
That's child play now I gotta taste for blood
I gotta see some meat hangin' 'fore the jobs well done
I need to see a nigga drop 'fore I make my gun stop
And before I start shootin', I make sure you hop
Niggas wind me up and wind me up
'Til I pop up on your scene like Jack in the Box
With the two toppings, cuttin' at you up like butter
VA style nigga your meat get smothered
Mobb style nigga me and my blood brothers kill
Pretty boy, rappers if their songs speak others
Oh you shot niggas before? That's cool wit me

Before all this rap shit, I was already bugged",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-my-priorities-lyrics

We gon' be right there, we gon' lay for you
And we gon' make sure you pay for that shit you pulled
Eyy'day, we gon' graveyard shift for you
We gon' take turn stakin' your crib, watchin' your moves
Calculatin' your steps, plottin' on your head, dunn
How you gon' leave a job half done
How you gon' buck my man and walk around like you did sumin'
Like he don't got family dukes
Like we ain't gon' ride for his gun shot wounds
My nigga took two in his lungs, one in his face
And you gon' pay the ultimate toll for his pain
And I don't give a fuck about them motha'fuckin' goons you got
All time niggas get shot, be in Brooklyn, Manhattan
Queens and the Bronx, Long Island, Staten Island
Now let's get it on!

C'mon let's be men about things
When my gun bangs and you hit
Don't snitch, don't squeal
Niggas wanna buck their gun
But when they get touched they tell
Even if I'm layin' on my death bed
On my way outta here, dawg
I won't talk, I won't tell, I won't squeal
I'mma just make sure niggas get peeled
Somebody get killed

Yo, yo, uh-huh, yo, um, yo, yo
It's amazin' how these homo niggas talk like bitches
Claim they're thug, get bagged, now switch position
Don't know a nigga behind them closed doors
Is he talkin'?, or keep it gangsta at all?
Mouf tight, who gives a fuck, let them pin that murder
Knows nothin' about nothin', it won't go no further
They could catch me red handed with the smokin' burner
Most of y'all niggas, probably fold and shiver
Like a bitch that couldn't even hold a ligger
But when that ass hit the block, that ass is gon' get sicker
Cause um, we don't play those games
Fuck around, probably gave the D's a list with our Government names
Got a slug with your name on it and the date on it
Niggas wanna snitch, it's only right I hate on it
I'mma give that ass and I put weight on it
That motha'fucka empty shit, yea we on it

C'mon let's be men about things
When my gun bangs and you hit
Don't snitch
Cause when I layed in the emergency and D's came to question me
I ain't speak
Even when I'm layin' on the death bed
On my way outta here, dawg
I won't talk, I won't tell, I won't squeal
I'mma just make sure heads get peeled
Niggas get killed

Yo, yo, yo, yo
When it was time to ride, we rode
Emptied out and reload
I was tryin' to hit 'em in his dome
Likely I didn't, but I think I hit 'em
That nigga ain't dead, so we ain't done wit 'em
He must be out of his fuckin' mind
Fuckin' wit mine, now that nigga gotta get it one mo' time
Word to my mother, it's on when he recover
He bucked my dunn, now it's gon' repercussion
Man that nigga get himself in somethin' deep
For thinkin' somethin' sweet
Now I'mma peel his fuckin' meat
If he ain't tell the cops already
It's time for you to go, whether or not you're read
Cause I love my niggas, so I ride for my niggas
And if it gotta be then I'll die for my niggas
And if they can't live unless if I get you

And I remain the same, values never changed up
I can look inside the mirror every time I wake up
While they be shouting up a life they make up
We gon do better things, cause this what life made us
How many g's you know surviving here to tell the story
Go on i've this thing come back to make history

And keep a thing on me, clapping at these niggas like remember us
It's just a matter time, before you cope like barb wire
Spit the flames on this mic start a bonfire
So sit around, and hear the words that I speak
And this a blessing, I ain't chose this life, it chose me

This the life we chose, dealing with the life we chose
It's a cold world, homie, and it's only getting colder

You got here with your corny ass version
Let me guess I'm rappin your life and you that real deal huh
I can't come to the hood, unless I get permission from

Non stop fire, god damn I'm so cold
Nothing I can do about it, I will never go broke

Y'all niggas is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggas is so bald they might be
Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play

Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights

That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?

Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
In formation pack the lead up in shit

Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop 'em in they tracks, goin at 'em when you send 'em
Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal

Listen, if you goin out of town and don't bear them gats

It ain't where you from, kid, it's where you at
If you caught up in a beef and you scared to clap

Dogs, it ain't where you from, it's where you at

Shit, thug listen (What up baby?)
Ain't nothin 'round here but drug addiction
Niggas is anti-love-livin
The slug-givin little shortie on the snub itchin
For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin
The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak em and run, some guys light the blunts up
(And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin to speed a nigga pulse up
(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with Glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love


You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this
Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas

It's bad enough I gotta grow up the fast way
These things going on got me thinkin they the last days
Tryin to come up, but shorty with a plan
Doin my best but can't see the promise in my land
These older cats wildin out over turf dog
I'm caught in the middle and it can't get worse
Just the other day I saw my homie wheeled off in a hearse
So used to it, it don't even hurt
My heart's numb, guess that's the Dunn Dunn
Can't speak on it, 'less you been where I come from
Stuck like bubble gum with no help from anyone
Moms got four others -- my four younger brothers
We're not supposed to do the tender age of ten

Fore I lay me down to sleep pray to God that I'll see the next day
And do my best, hope these streets don't get me

Growin up amongst the violence and drugs
Growin up against the world and such (Uh-huh)

We the team that'll crush anybody you bring
We the one that's gon' hold it down, it's no thing no sweat
It barely take no strength, you cowards ain't built for this

Play all day and night without a care in the world
But it's drama in my hood, sho' it's hard to chill
You gotta stay on point and sharp as hell
Dunn, we just wanna have fun
I just wanna be with my dawgs, cuz we all we got
Don't why it is, but that's how it is
I just wanna be with my clique cuz that's where I fit

(It's real) Where do I turn to, who do I console in?
I know I'm just a shorty but I want my wrist frozen nice
As I sat and thought many a nights
I could do the right thing or get read my rights
It's life, in the hood
Everything that look, it ain't
I stole base, now I'm runnin from home plate
Runnin from jake, sweat runnin down my face
And I can pay for every move I make

Just enjoy your youth, you only live once
Lil' dunn control yourself, learn discipline
And show some respect for others
Shit is serious on the street, you playin with fire
Concentrate on yourself and don't follow nobody
Hit them school books, so you ain't gotta borrow no money
These is jewels for you that you gon' wear forever
From us to y'all, now listen up to pa

No second thoughts, cuz my conscience is demandin
For the bloodshed(bloodshed) I leave that mug red(mug red)

Back at the cabin, be at the round table plannin
Spread team across plannin, expansion
Slap a nigga opened handly style something foul
For tryin to slow down, my cash pile a hundred mile
I can recall the days, juvenile crime pays
14 years old, shorty from round way
Brick ass cold, still puffin night to day
But why did my life have to be this way
I rock Velour suits, flavors like mixed fruits
My loot give recoup razors in my suit
Incase you try to troop me to the island
I known for start whylin
Back in New York, my shortie's got the cash pilin
Peep this on some knowns and teef shit
So much drama, who the fuck knows who we got beef wit

And my response to that is, I palms don’t ever stop itching, nigga
You know, it’s about that you hear it right now, so…

We back, people, for more money, more jewelry, more vehicles
Less hangers on, tag-alongs, and leech dudes
We back minus that weak label trying to hold us back
Now we gettin’ more profits every unit shipped
You gettin’ returns, your album ain’t movin’ shit
We gettin’ our burn in places we don’t even live
We learn you niggas on this game and how to stay afloat
We teach you clowns about some things that y’all don’t know
Like how to bang out songs for 12 years straight
And that’s not all—they all gotta be gangsta
Consistent anthems, put us up against whoever
We got a thing for competition, only make us better
And better and better, I know you can’t believe your ears
You pinching yourself, but doggie, this is all real
Convincing yourself that we Cell Block 4 thugs
Man, that’s how the last nigga got bucked

Homie, don’t get it twisted, I been gettin’ money since ’90
‘Fore Magic retired and Lakers head coach was Pat Riley
I bone a bitch then bounce, baby girl, don’t mind me
If you mad, take it up with God, that’s how designed me
I’m multi-talented—fuck you think Jive signed me?
The only thing grimey is that pen that you write with
Got your main hoe two-waying me on my Sidekick
Talking how she fuck you but she really don’t like it
About my paper when it come to that hustle, I all-night it
If I ain’t been through it, yo, Havoc won’t bite it
I can’t keep it real for shit, but everything happens for a reason
So I won’t wifey the wrong bitch
I’m a bastard, pimpin’ in a Caddy 16
I’m a bastard, pimpin’ in a Caddy 16
Y’all know nothin’ ‘bout it, make the Maybach look weak
With compartment secretly designed to stash the heat

Yo, these niggas know my style—fuck is wrong with you, doggy?
Know these cannons’ll blast off and make this place foggy
Have everybody in this bitch cramped in the door
I just introduce myself and let the hammer applaud

To built me a mini mansion the size of an octopus
And the crib sittin' on stilts, take off the Stilettos
Get me to hug you from the cold, the life and the bezel
I hit it up on wedge you, my schedule just won't permit it
I visit the gangsta town, but enough is committed
Might see me with another, don't go start trippin'
You my classic edition, one I got runnin' my kitchens
See it's about the pop and when it finally pop
Would you complain, or just shut your mouth
Oh yeah it's gon' pop so baby play your part
And get a cup of jealousy bitch


My money ain't nothin', Jada you ain't fuckin'
See that's the fine print you need to understand, cousin
See I was sure he'd die for having game I
A tape rollin' for 50, cause he the boss I
Can't front, its gon' take some time to get used to

Get ready for the rip session at the Sheridan
I got her smokin'' weed, I got her drinkin' vin
Say, Nas yes you don't do none of that there
I turn your woman out, then I turn around and drop em off like 'good'
Man we done stepped it up and we done found a home
For all this gangsta shit, for all this fuckin' dope

Simplify this shit for these stupid ass niggas out here
‘Cause you know niggas is stupid, son
So we gon’ do this shit like this, son
(Alchemist) Ayo…

You would wanna respect my team, it’s no dream
Guns with the blue beam, we tear apart things
Body parts get ripped, clothing get torn
When you see my niggas battle, fuck down, it’s on
Right now in the presence of thugs, my flesh and my bone
Will be the proof we still living this, homes
Don’t make me have to show my grizzly, for getting busy
Like Cousin Craig caught them bodies at Wendy’s
No liquor could amp me up with drugs and such (You know)
I’m naturally born for this, dunn
Rap with killers, about murders that took place
Laugh with bananas niggas about homicides and things
Watch out now, pardon my chain
I know my shit bulky, but it’s just part of my game
Jewelry like the Juice Crew in the ‘80s, mad weight
My niggas is untouchable, you can’t eat

Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive

Yo, it’s that real shit, shit to make ‘em feel shit, true
Most of my niggas is guerrillas, they career criminals
The foulest individuals that you would ever cross paths with
Think of it as a blessing if you only get that ass kicked
I got a vision, most of y’all niggas too short-sighted to see it
Start a riot then leave it
Like Sealy Posturepedic, I lay ‘em down with that four-fever
Fuck your favorite diva, have her going ‘round and ‘round
I know you love the way it’s going down
Mobb is back up in this bitch, muthafucka, what now?
The H-A-V-the O-the C
That’s word to me, y’all niggas is pussy
In need of a tampon, niggas’ll be bleeding heavy
Know that thing’ll tear his ass to confetti
Put him to beddy, know my gangsta overflows the levee
Call in the National Guard way my flow so deadly, nigga
(Shit is deadly, son) Yeah, you heard me, nigga
Havoc’s too much, skills is unearthly, nigga

Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets

‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive
Real niggas feel niggas when it comes to the beef
It be the Mobb and y’all niggas know who running the streets
We give a fuck, do what you must to survive
‘Cause the beast is hungry and these streets’ll eat you alive

As I take big pulls from the back of the spliff
Looking at everything around me, I itch
For a nigga to step from under they rock with dumb shit
Niggas see us, dunn, they better humble up quick
They wanna cut at me, they better hit something
Bullets hitting my Jeep just ain’t gon’ be enough, man
You niggas is babies compared to my thug
Y’all niggas talk too much, they snitching on us

Yeah, First Infantry, Mobb Deep
Mr. I-20, Disturbing Tha muthafuckin’ Peace

Got nothing to lose, cause shit ain't workin' out for the kid
I had a deal over at Virgin, but they dropped the kid
How come, I don't know, they wasn't feelin' the kids
Or the music to hot for their ears to list'
Back to square one it's all good, it ain't gon' stop a nigga
Like have me do something stupid like go and pop a nigga
It's a movie and I'mma be the star of this shit
With ten bitches at one time, suckin' my dick
We gon' get rich and kill them two cats, that snitch
IM3, bustin' they way, through this hip hop shit
So watch your lip, don't say nothin' about my click
Or catch a clip, while you walkin' wit ya lady and shit
We crazy and shit, like chickens with their head cut off
We little niggas with big guns that'll take your head off
And we rippin' your lady in the bathroom of the Green Acres Mall
Where gonna stand tall, we fall if a slug hit our chest
It's all gravy, Queensbridge roll like the Navy
Little girls runnin' around havin' mad babies

Yo, ya'll don't a give a yeah, we don't give a yeah
At the, end of the day, a slug'll, ruin your liver
For real, on the strength of that automatic steel
So fast, you won't have time to build

Ayo, we here foot in the door, time for take off
Yo, we take over, move over, IM3
And ya'll niggas don't really mean shit to me
Spread love through the five boroughs, tri-state mid-state
Violate, get your face carved in
Fuckin' with these Queensbridge marksmen
Never go against our grain, twenty tats, ball head cat, rep QB
See me on the stage iced out, laced up
Hazed up, jumping in them big ass trucks
When we shoot you better duck, you out of luck young'n
Catch you runnin' while we gunnin', chasin' you down like blood hounds
Beatin' you down, to the very last compound
With fo'four pounds, two aluminum bats, we ruin' you cats
We IM3 nigga you better move back, we fake no jacks
Jump real quick, we them Queens motherfuckers, that stay in that bullshit


Looking back at time, a lot of niggas died
Right before my eyes, suicide, homicide, do or die
My crew and I, pledge Infamous, don't leave no witnesses
We handled all our differences, these menaces we livin' it
We've been gettin' it got it, Glock cock won't hesitate
To empty out the whole clip, y'all niggas best notice
When it's time and it's bout to go down, we control the shit
Ain't nobody in this whole, industry can hold us in
You can try, but you won't succeed, we a rare breed
And don't say much, cause, real niggas don't speak
Amongst beef, my handle like, hot sauce
I take that on top boards, my action unaccountable
Could snap at any give time, doubting you
My raps steady pounding you, we drowning you with Infamous
The IM3 continuous, we livin' it, I speak from experience
He's driven it, we M-O-B-B, QB, Murda Muzik

Yo, that's that that shit, that I be, talkin' about
Niggas, playin' they hands wrong, runnin' they mouth
Snitchin', all up in they blood, I can't click
There ain't nothing to discuss, I only fuck with

While you still tryin' to overcome your childhood fears
We settin' up shop, takin' over the blocks
In e'ry hood, e'ry boy, and e'ry girl gon' cop
Now, we chillin' in, new airplanes and Rolls Royces
My watch is my president and guess who's the first lady?
Yeah, my big fat princess cut
She a little overweight but I love her so much
So charged up right now, you nigg** better stop
If I squeeze, we gon' breeze to the top of the charts

I'm certified, A-L-C claimin' his clout
And I'ma show you what that name's about
And - the +Quiet Storm+ (ssshhh!) blew out the fuckin' lights
Flood the block and overflow personal
Trained pipes, me and H, yea we the same type
Get the checks in the daytime and bang out in the late nights
Plus, I'm on the grind, snatch a quarter 'mil from KOCH
'Cause I shook the spot, it went from the bottom to the top
(Get that) I fake then I'm swingin' the rock
Anyway you cut the cake I get my CREAM off the top
CREAM of the crop, on sideways, leanin' and drop
Top speed 'til the cops give me a reason to stop
Even in the winter season I'm hot

For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck lookin' cute, save that for the broad
It's the H A V O, C-dump-and-reload
Knock knock, answer that, I'm blastin' through the peephole

Call me a old school cat wit aiyyoung mentality
I live by the day and I go out for family
I don't understand language if it ain't talkin' money
From the era walkin' 'round with knots lookin' bummy
Certain bitches knew the code so they went with the flow
And let you know they wanted fifty-four elevens from the door
We cut school, cooked caine, took traum' to the brain
And though a nigga had it, still hopped the f*ckin' train
Look back and laugh but ain't shit funny still
My little brother took his life, forever I'm stuck with a ice grill
Got friends with chemical imbalances
And when the love get tough, believe me it's challengin'
You go out for me, I'm goin' out for you

How the fuck a nigga figure he can come through this?
With no worry at all and ice on his wrist
Plottin' to get it, poppn' them slugs
One in the mug, leave 'em in the morgue, keepin' it gangsta? we keepin'
It thug
Makin' albums, washin' that dough made from narcotics
You know the mob brolic, gats we got it
Like a bitch on her period, don't even wanna see you
Unless you got what I need, and we sure not peoples
Only niggas that I fuck wit' could hold what I bust wit'
A one minute nigga, hit 'em like when I nut quick
Got a bad ass bitch that'll fuck your clique
Ass so fat, make the illest nigga dry snitch
It's time to stretch on these cats 'cause my dogs is restless
The number one sinner mothafucka, repent this
Chorus -
Fuckin' wit' us will leave you in a cardboard box
Fuckin' wit' us will leave you leakin', callin' the cops
With nothin' to bust? we'll leave you in a fucked up spot
And you don't even wanna be that nigga claimin' a spot

Pure breed grower, flow gives brain tumors
Holla at ya dog, movin' units
Ain't ready for the onslaught
Try to knock the Don off

Got that feelin' inside, who willin' to ride?
Aight here, take this Four-Five
Cardboard box these niggas off sides

Poppin' his collar nigga, tossin' that dollar
Act up, blood clot his throat, make it hard to swallow
Used to pitch times holdin' trotters
Now I pitch 16's with the culture power saga
You sorry, don't bother, Q.B. to Carter
Rucker, Nino, Goodfella, Godfather

Verse 3: (Littles)
Came home after 5, stood on my own two
I learned to seperate Men from Boys and crews
I toy with dudes, now I'm just annoyed with fools
I'm a pimp on a track with another Mans food
I refuse to be whored by another Mans rules
It's a pimp and ho game, you gotta respect the business
But I only mob with thugs and gangsta niggas
It seems nowadays snitches get respect

Watch and slam us, locked up, box and canners

It's your turn now
Crazy how I never use to say a single word
I just held in all the hurt, all this hurt
And I was so afraid you might flip out
And leave me in the cold
Then my mind ran out of space

How would you feel
If I put my girls before the one I love
How would it feel
If every time you want to talk
I turn the TV on
How would you feel
If when we're making love
I don't go down no more

Get ready cause a 3-6-0's about to go down

Once you swallow then I got you trapped
No more running
No more hiding
And if you try
I'm still gon find ya
And get you back
Get you back
Listenin' to my conversations
On the other phone
Got somebody followin' me
When I leave out our home
And I am so appalled
You take it there
When you're the one who messed up
It's like I'm sleepin' with the enemy
How would you like it
If your girlfriend started playin' F.B.I
And she was the one
You forgave when she messed up
And spread her thighs
Plays with his brain
Started foolin' with ya money

Your Bens
Your friends

And I'm not a woman
If I don't stand up in what I believe in
Taste that
50/50's it's suppose to be
But less than 25 is what you gave me
No more running

And if ya try

And get you back
Get you back
Oh

Temperature’s Rising (LP version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
Uhh, no doubt, son, word up
(Havoc)
Word up, son, I heard they got you on the run
Filled with body, now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phone tap so I won't speak long
Gimme a half second and I'ma put you on
It's all messed up, somebody's snitchin on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Axin on your whereabouts, so where d'you sleep?
They said they just wanna question you bet me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced but now you're stayin low
Once in a blue I check ta see how ya doin
I know you need loot so I send it thru Western Union
They probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin to find who they're lookin for but they want ta see
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But worse, son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers to get their thug on but oh well
Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
Oh, you heard who did what and why I don't this shit
So stop askin, then I know I'm not goin crazy
From windows I see lights flashin and maybe
Somebody's takin pictures
You know who that be, police lovers and neighbourhood snitches
They put up *?pertice?* so everybody's pointin fingers
And lyin, aiyo son, the temp is risin
Chorus:
The temperature's risin, no there's nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and nothin's surprisin
The temperature's risin, huh and there's nothin surprisin
The temperature's risin (There's nothin surprisin)
(Prodigy)
What up, black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops or wings on your backs
That snitch nigga gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killer listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around tryin to be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home you was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme you probably be locked up
Tried to hussle, where along the lines your plan slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminisce on how I use to pick you up in the Ac
Years ago when we was younger seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin who snitched and got me losin lots of sleep
At night, you know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops cos that shit ain't right
Sometimes I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn, why the situation go down like dat?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
In a couple of years, fool we'll see you around
But til then maintain and keep ya story the same
The cops is grabbin wrong niggas, lookin for someone to blame
They harrassin, strugglin to find the truth
Is it a chance ya case'll get thrown out cos they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver me the gun, I'll tie two, quickly throw it in the river
Make sure it's safe to the bottom
Our smart police snuck you out at the projects, we got em
But still, but still, but still......

Shed So Many Tears,The Mix Tape Before 9/11,2004.0,"Yeah
It's more of that gangsta shit
Real shit (Yeah)
It's gon' get deep in this shit right now

From out the depths of hell, a black angel came up
And still was able to fly with burn wings done
Brought up with little white devil's, and black devil's
The evil's in his blood from ancestor's, that raped his great Grandmother's, so they kids  and I was one of them
As a child I really couldn't understand why
Life was the way it was, and I was getting tired of the lies
I tried to drink away the pain, and painkillers would knock me off
Only to awake to the same Ol' bullshit
My own pops couldn't answer my questions about god
Gave me the bullshit moms wasn't no help, she was confused as Him, fuck it you can't blame them
Who shot Martin?, Malcom?, B.I.G?, and Pac?
I don't know, all I know is that (I shed so many tears)

Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
It ain't gon' stop nothin' nigga, we gangsta
Ain't nothin' up but our mothafuckin' paper
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Whether California, New Yorkers, I love all my thugs, cause money like drugs

Feel me, 'fore they kill me, I know I'm a target
H.P. knew n' got bodied for startin' shit, guess I'm next on the list
Cuz' when I turned nineteen I figured out who I really is
And who they really Is, it's blue bloods that's runnin' the world
Serpents and aryan's, word to my girl, and that queen in England Ain't nothin' But a whore, In Babylon the great shall fall
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil; so bring it on man
Let's go, fuck y'all niggas waitin' 'round fo'
Y'all scared to speak your mind and catch bullet holes
Y'all scared cuz' they Assassinated they people before?
(come on man)
Well fuck it I'll gon' down for y'all, and maybe you'll learn
From all of my blood shed, to open yah eyes
Man all I know is (I shed so many tears)

Lord, lost so many peers

It ain't gon' stop nothin' nigga, we gangsta
Ain't nothin' up but our mothafuckin' paper
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Whether California, New Yorkers, I love all my thugs, cause money like drugs

We learn to walk, after we crawl, then we stand tall
That's what life's about
I grew up with blood in my eyes mixed with tears, that's what it be  Growin' up as a juvenile, and now my whole life style's corrupt
The piece That paved the way, go on and blazes up
They told me how to raise it up
Pour out liquor for my niggas, we greed an' we haze it up
I seen a nigga get blasted up
With a volver' gun, , grenades, even gauged up
Cause no one gave a fuck, life's a bitch, n' they seeds become Bastards, that Raise themselves, In the streets gettin' flavored up
Girl's gettin' turned out, lookin' burnt out, they basin' it up
And some turn they back instead of being corrupt

Tell 50 to come here, listen to this shit
Aight, aight
Yeah, yeah, a true story 'bout a bum ass nigga
Who became the world's richest bum ass nigga
Haha, woooo, word up
Fuck all you niggas
Aiyo

Man, I've been fucked up for so long, and now I'm rich
All of them broke niggas that I used to fuck with
Got that look in they eyes, got that scheme on they face
When I pop up around the way like ain't shit changed
Look here: don't make me put yo' brains on display
You niggas never gave a fuck about P
Now it's all about me, and why I don't break bread
Where do we sleep, and how can we break in?
Is he in his Jeep? Or maybe it's the Porsche?
Let's catch him in the V, and tear the nigga all up
No, I don't think so
I'm all in my mirrors and out my windows
I get up out the car with the Desert Eagle
Shorty don't like me, said I got an ego (Let's get him, let's get him)
So, she tell niggas they should stick me
Gassin' niggas up to make history
So, they take the jooks so they can make the books
But I banged the heat when they came for me, like

Niggas think they so big
P make a lil blood spill
Now you punk ass niggas know
If you fucks with me, it's a must you bleed

Catch me New York cruisin'
Stick in a movie, smokin' that Sour Diesel
Won't point every time that I blew it
Nice gamin', homie, it's foolish, don't think about it, just do it
I'll put ya through it like that hurricane that ran through Houston
You ain't shootin', you ain't scarin' nothin', y'all just flukes
Robbin' niggas, strip they ass to they birthday suit
I never picked grapes, but I cut me a bunch
I'm that nigga in the club watchin' yo' ass get duffed
Niggas wanna hang up once they finally got bored with us
And they baby momma sluttin' out there on tour with us
Pass it to the homie once a nigga get bored with her
Almost couldn't nut 'cause your ass got caught in her
Duke frontin', come on baby, you ain't got no guns
All you got is that rusty ass Revolver, son
And you can't fool me, I know they borrowed, nigga
Niggas think that they ill but the Mobb is iller
You know the game",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-so-i-lyrics
"Shook Ones, Part I (Original Version)",The Infamous - 25th Anniversary Expanded Edition,2020.0,"The most violent of the violentest crimes, we give life to
If these Queensbridge kids don't like you
We bring drama of the worst kind of enemies
Your first time will be your last Earth memories
It's only your own fault, I gave you fair warning
Beware of killer kids who don't care
Unaware fools will be dealt with in time
It ain't a mystery in how I form the words in rhyme
In nineteen hundred and ninety square
All shook niggas is supposed to have fear
Tryna get a piece of this pie, we don't share
Prepare for the worst 'cause I been there
Try to keep a positive mind and walk a straight line don't work
So niggas is forced to do dirt
And God made dirt, so this dirt won't hurt
If I listen to the lessons and the rules I learnt
On these streets for nineteen years and not leaving
My first priority's to reach twenty-one breathing
Forever beef, nobody will ever be even
So I grab the heat before breezing
Lost in this foul mind-state, I can't keep straight thinkin'
But I keep my eyes on the Earth without blinking
It's hard to be a man in this land of the venom
Any man try to front, he get slugs in him, because

He ain't a crook, son, son
He just a shook one, shook one
(Shook one)
We live the life, that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds, earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son
He just a shook one, shook one

For every rhyme I write, it's twenty-five to life
To all my peoples in the Bridge, know what I'm talking 'bout, right?
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
'Cause Queens niggas don't play
I don't got time for the he-say she-say, I'm bigger than that
Claiming that you pack a gat, but you scared to get locked
Once you get upon the Island, change your ways and stop
Thirteen years in the projects of hard times to live in
Wake up in the morning, thank God I'm still living
Sometimes I wonder do I deserve to live?
Or I am gonna burn in hell for all the shit I did?
No time to dwell on that 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, nigga, lay on your back
I don't fake jacks, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for a recognition mission
I'm strictly sipping E&J like got my mind flippin'
I'm bugging, digging my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my motherfuckin' function
As long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit
Your dome up when I roll up
Don't be caught sleeping, 'cause I'm creeping
You just a shook one

We live the life, that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds
Some niggas get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son
He just a shook one, shook one
We live the life, that of diamonds and guns
And numerous ways that we choose to earn funds

For about 20 joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fed this nigga rolled with the sorry fuck now he switchin' to lame
Niggas in the box could relate to my pain

If These Walls Could Talk,UnKnown,2002.0,"Verse 1
Yo, sittin' in my room and if these walls could talk
They'd probably be snitching on me, draggin' me into court
And if I had a wife, most likely be divorced
Up my ass in debt payin' child support
And me try'na live right, never gave it a thought
I'd probably do a pound cake, for all the gats I stashed
 my crew burn hash, all day lovely
Never fuck with Phillies, 'cause they burn too fast
Tellin' all my dime bitches how I'm, a little 
One second in my room and they be out the door
They should accept it though, fucking let them go
And all I gotta say is, all these rumours show when I blow
See these walls is just , it don't get no ass
Similar to player haters that don't get no ass
Once in a while I talked to him, 'cause he know my past
I burn it down with 'em, and lace the shit with hash
 x2
To get snitched on is one thing
But if these walls talk they be lettin' out everything
Gotta watch who the fuck that you talk around
The ones that talk'll probably be the ones that get pound
Verse 2
Imagine if my walls could speak, that'd be some foul shit
'Cause all the things I've done, they never announced it
Ashamed of the plots and schemes and drugs we took
Guns that'd make the D's run shook
They'd probably tell my wife all about my grimey trife life
 be on my dick worse
My background hurts, and these four walls know it
And since the police and how the dough got stolen
Tell my enemies I stay holdin'
And where I stash at
And gave them the convo, the way the cash at
Catch a flashback to me, beating my dick to porno flicks
Flipping to short eyes, gettin' bent
The smoke sessions, the deepest convo's amongst the brethren
For our ears only
The walls start confessin'
Spillin' the beans on the whole team and how we operate
Cooperate with the rest of the collegues
Our recipe on how we make our crack like bricks
And where we got our n****s pumpin' and shit
Dunn, I would have to toss the crib
'Cause the extortions of 
And if the walls started talkin', yo
They'd sing a song, but whoa, some things you didn't know
'Cause I don't brag on how we rock and roll",https://genius.com/Mobb-deep-if-these-walls-could-talk-lyrics
