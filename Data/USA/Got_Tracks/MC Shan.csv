The Bridge,Down By Law,1987,"Ladies and gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour
They wanna tell you a little story about where they come from
 x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

You love to hear the story again and again
Of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place
 x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name, it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean T-Tom
A brother who's known for his rap - Jappy Jap
Larry Larr, third least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
Phase Brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door get frisked, just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town then you couldn't fight and win
But every time they had a jam they couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there in the parks they had to cease
'Cause you was in
 x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit your ass had better run
Cause you're in
 x3
The Bridge, Queensbridge

Dimples D the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was Sucker DJ's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn out
By any place any part of the world
And while I'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
While she's in
 x7
The Bridge, Queensbridge

Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you may
Don't ever listen to what nobody say
'Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
'Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
They're trying to lead your destiny
By the time you think about it you're grown
Then you say goddamn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Which people always pulling always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pulling you back when you want to get ahead
They pull you back cause they're not with it
You're talking about school
They're talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time will fly
But you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal 'cause I'm reaching for mine
And I'm from
 x4
The Bridge, Queensbridge

Keep on rocking, the bridge will keep rocking
If the beats stop rocking the bridge will keep rocking
If the beats start rocking the bridge will keep rocking

Kill That Noise,Down By Law,1987.0,"Rhyming is a thing that I do at will
Be glad to rock a party just to prove my skill
J-u-ice is what I'm gaining
With a style so fresh that it's self-explaining
Never bite a rhyme, I don't live that way
But when I get dissed, violators pay
I'm a crowd motivator, MC annihilator
Never front the move 'cause I'm not a perpetrator
I don't really mind bein' criticized
But those who try to make fame on my name: die
Rhymes of all styles, all categories
From fresh freestyles to real fly stories
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
And if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise

I devastate the crowd while the record spins
So-called competitors have no wins
I laugh at MC's who call me wack
You ordered, and now I'm gonna serve you, Jack
We're respected by all, treated just like kings
How could you have the nerve to say such things?
If you knew at the time what you were saying
You wouldn't be on your knees - praying
You gotta understand I'm not the average MC
At the first sign of trouble grab the mic and flee
Grab the mic, plug in the beat box jacks
Prepare for the battle, then proceed to wax
Take as much time I feel is ample
To duff an MC to be made example
This goes for all sucker MC chumps
Who hear my name, and suddenly Kool-Aid pumps
So if you're thinking 'bout dissing me, better think twice
'Cause next time, brother, I won't be so nice
You can come all alone or bring all your boys
But if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise
(South Bronx)
Kill that, kill that noise (Repeat x8)

I must say MC's got a lot of spunk
To get up on stage and pop so much junk
I'm not worried 'cause I don't get waxed
And you wouldn't believe how hard I max
School's in session, I'm about to teach
Versatile with a style that you just can't reach
Lesson number one: first strike aim
You shouldn't do things to degrade my name
Your records won't sell 'cause the people won't buy 'em
A sucker MC's like chicken: I fry him
I started with a smash, I'ma leave with a bang
And to put it to you bluntly, MC's can't hang
Your boys and your family will be grieving your death
Weeping while they're sweeping up the pieces I left
You can come all alone or bring all your boys
But if you knew what I knew then you'd kill that noise
Marley Marl
: 
Yo Shan, I didn't hear you say Hip Hop started in the Bridge on your record
MC Shan: I didn't, they wanted to get on the bandwagon

Because I rhyme so fly, girls can't resist
But her man can't understand, so he gets pissed
Like a preacher at work, when she hurt I'll heal her
I'll leap, you sleep, and believe I steal her
My mama used to say be a ladies' man
I used to always wonder why she named me Shan
Not hard to pronounce, easy to spell
And oh how I love it when the ladies yell
Her man better chill when my jacket's unzipped
I got a .25 with an 8 shot clip
You're sayin' to yourself that's a BB gun
But the place that I'mma shoot ya it'll take just one
I'll rip you into parts, little pieces and specks
You'll be saying to yourself ""What can happen next?""
This jam is dedicated to you and your boys
But if you knew what I knew, then you'd kill that noise
Shoulda stayed in school, learned comprehension
Trying to state facts that I did not mention
Sucker MC's I hate the most
Next time I make a record you should listen close
'Cause MC's like me are the real McCoys
So you sucker MC's better kill that noise

Marley they're trying to diss us, man
What's wrong with that, I took care of that
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
KRS-One and Scott La Rock
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Yo, he talk about, strung on something
Man, we cold cooling in the place
Drivin' fresh Audis and coupes
What's wrong with y'all
Strung?
The only thing we strung on is music
And you strung on ours",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-kill-that-noise-lyrics
Left Me Lonely,Down By Law,1987,"She used to tell me that she loved me all the time
I'd turn to her and say that, ""I'm
Infatuated by your lovely smile
And some day soon we're gonna walk the aisle""
She'd say, ""You're my everything, my strength for life
Be the mother of your children, as well as your wife""
She used to tell me all the time, I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

Coincidental how I met her
But when I seen her I knew that I'd get her
Can't let her step, she look too good
But my wears made me seem like a stone cold hood
I'm a lucky guy, so I press my luck
I step to her, ah what the fuck
Went her way, took a few steps past her
Got the nerve, and then I asked her
I said, ""Yo baby,"" and she started to reach
I said, ""Whoa, don't get excited, that's a figure of speech""
She told me her name, gave her number and all
And when I stepped, she said I better call
It took about a month, but she was finally mine
Everything was going smooth, we were doin' fine
After a while it wasn't no thing
We were either holding hands or she was under my wing
She used to whisper in my hear I'm her one and only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely
[Hook: 
TJ Swan
]
Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say
Girl, why'd you have to leave for so long?
I never did you wrong
And it seems we had such a love that was so strong

On the day she broke out, would you believe I cried?
And it hurts so much to think of how she lied
I shared everything to the very last penny
Somethin' that you really can't do with many
Since this young lady was such a big winner
I'd treat her all the time to a candle light dinner
Have a violinist play a real sweet song
And she never showed a sign that somethin' was wrong
My boy used to say (Man Shan, I'd quit her)
But she seemed so happy every time I'm with her
We used to hold hands and walk in the rain
And on the days I felt down she eased my pain
This was just too far-fetched to believe
To think that my girl would just up and leave
Imagine that - I just couldn't
Cause I knew deep down in my heart she wouldn't
All of a sudden a lot of things changed
She started actin' funny, I mean a bit strange
We had little squabbles, arguments, fights
Wild stories in the days and stayed out nights
I'd say, ""Baby, where you been for all that time?
She cuddled me close and say that I'd
Be the one that she call her only
But she ran with another man and left me lonely

Girl, why'd you have to leave me that way?
I love you to this day
And it hurts to think of the words you used to say

She put it to me plain, couldn't put it no clearer
Lipstick written on the bedroom mirror
Said, 'I'm leaving you now, and I know that you'll miss me
You're probably saying: Damn, man, why she dissed me?
But you see, I felt that it was time to go
Then I packed my bags, and I'm leavin', so
You take care and I hope you live long
And don't worry, there's nothing that you did wrong
You'll find the right girl someday, you'll see
Why I'm the type of woman that must be free'
I said, ""Why me?"" and fell to the bed
Reached for the 9 and put it to my head
And thought about the words that she once said
(Shan, you know that you're my one and only)
But she ran with another man and left my lonely

O-o-o-oh girl, oh my girl
Why'd you have to leave?
Leave me so sad
Girl, you broke my heart
Oh, you drive me wild
You leave me by myself
All by myself
Girl, I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Ooh so wild
Baby drive me crazy
Leave me by myself
Leave me all alone
By the phone
I don't know what to do
I'm so mad
Girl, you drive me wild
Oh so wild
When I saw you leave me
Makes me want to cry
Girl, I'm breakin' down
Breakin' down
Yo, I don't know what to do
(Love)",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-left-me-lonely-lyrics
They Used To Do It Out in the Park,Born to Be Wild,1988,"The hip-hop sound went through stages
Embark on a trip as I flip through pages
This particular part 'bout a bridge on the Hudson
I first got hand by the rhymes and the cuts and
If I'm not mistaken makin' two records mix
And certain deejays had a few dope tricks
If you asked to be on you would be their guest, y'all
Say a few ""ho""s and a ""yes yes yes y'all""
They had battles of the neighborhood jocks
And I used to take the jam right straight to the box
Every now and then you'd hear gunshots ring
Just duck, what the fuck, yo, it ain't no thing
What I thought was shots was just a few pranksters
Were pow-pow-pow men juicin' the gangsters
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
This was a time MCs used to bug out
Yo, what happened? (Yo, somebody pulled the plug out)
Just about the time when you jumped for joy
(Yo, you take my stage, I'mma kill you, boy)
Answer back and gettin smacked and your friends made jokes
(Hey, pack it up and get out of the park, folks)
But only to the cops we made some committment
I was shocked when the stick-up kids took the equipment
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Say - what - is the message?
(Love is the message)
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
In the winter time they moved the jams to the 
Do you think that the cold made the whole thing cease?
I recall seeing Flash one time - no, two
Can't forget about the Queensbridge Crew
For this is the place which I made my mark
And those who resist or try to diss get sparked
In the park after dark things really got cookin'
I seen the titles of idols and many chains get tooken
I seen the scatter of pack, letter for letter
If you wasn't from the town they'd beat you down
But these are just pieces of the ancient ways
But the rule still applies to the rhymes nowadays
Just wave your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
If you used to do it out in the park
Let me hear you say ""oh yeah!"" (oh yeah!)
Oh yeah! (oh yeah!)
A time when...
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
They used to do it out in the park
Dead dreams - still bought and sold
I strive and I strive to receive my goal
I'm still not happy up until this day
But I'm chill and I don't care what nobody say
Livin' and learnin' about the straight up deal
And got by cause I went by just what I feel
Cause I refuse to be mislead
By puttin' pipes to my lips and smoke in my head
Think about it, much, much later
Go to school and expand because knowledge is greater
But she chose to lead that fate
Eye to eye with a dick on a $5 date
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walkin' through life as if you were blind
You should reach for your goal cause I'm reachin' for mine
They used to d-do it out in the park
D-do it out in the park

Hip-hop - was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park

I Pioneered This,Born to Be Wild,1988,"The way I shine, I got splendor
I'm the real thing and not a pretender
You get the nerve to pop the fatal question
I'm takin' the time to make a small suggestion
Write a will for your family's conveniency
Rappers I serve without mercy or leniency
No frame of mind, no heart, I'm relentless
Step to me, I'm knockin' you senseless
I planted my seeds, so don't try to uproot me
You do better tryin' to straight up shoot me
I'm not just a writer, I'm a real idealist
It won't be long until you try to steal this
Make your head swell till your eyes start to dilate
Yeah sucker, you better not violate
Not one MC in the world I'm afraid of
Have you screamin' my name like your girl when I slayed her
This is the long cause I can't take a short take
Softer than cream between pieces of shortcake
There's no chance of you havin' a mistrial
The very next time that I get dissed I'll
Sit back and write a rhyme stronger than Hercules
Funky parts, I got back and I circle these
Put em together, fix the conjunction
Then I'mma bust rhymes till my brain malfunctions
Dare to degrade my name, that's perjury
War's declared, so prepare to have surgery
Cut you with a rhyme of such a high fidelity
Give a kick like a Roland
 and you's as soft as a melody
Since you're chalk my rhymes will erase ya
Want a piece of that ass so bad I could taste ya
Faced rappers from wack, ill, to even notorious
You may be clever, you'll be never victorious
I feel free now that I cleared this
How could I fell off, boy, I helped pioneer this

Violators, I go vic em
When I hear...it's like ""sic em!""
I transform just like a Decepticon
And once I step to you, boy, you're 'bout to be stepped upon
Say rhyme after rhyme back to back, so consecutive
Appointed rap's chairman, the highest executive
No time to grieve, you won't believe I slapped ya
Change the time frame and still barely capture
Ask em who's their dad and if they're not sayin me
If he wasn't deceased, then he gotta be payin' me
I'm super superb, Mister Fantastic
No relation to drugs, but this is dope on plastic
Don't try to play heroic and be Mr. Braveman
My rhymes become a whip and beat you down like a slavehand
If this is what you deserve I serve you with justice
Be as sharp as a pin and still can't bust this
Just name one time that Shan get jetted on
If you did get light, boy, now who you think shedded on?
My rhymes to your mind is like a breath to freshen up
This is not a threat, feel free about steppin' up
Once I'm on I'll think about gettin' off
Play me close or out of post and I bet that I be lettin' off
Rap is a game that you shouldn't indulge in
My rhymes are so good they keep my pockets bulgin'
To delight I sit back and write a rhyme like this one
Relax, grab the buddah and proceed to twist one
By then you might as well tell your boys nice knowin' ya
The next time they see ya, I'll probably be ho'ing ya
Cause I write rhymes in more than just two scoops
And Puma's the brand cause the Klan makes Troops
There's no competition cause there ain't no comp
Fuck around with this and get a mudhole stomp
I feel free now that I cleared this
How could I fell off, boy, I helped pioneer this

This throne is mine, I'll never sell or forfeit
So all you no-name rappers better get up off it
Although I been chillin', man, the villain that's still in me
But sayin I fell off is worse than killin' me
Marley sets the time for the rhyme to be ready by
One-two-three (yo man, put him to beddy-bye)
You cease to exist, I be your pitfall
You think that this is harsh? That ain't shit, y'all
Placed in the ground in wood as encasement
Those that bluffed got stuffed in the basement
Most of the time myself I kept to and
Obtain the rep that you're scared to step to
Don't assume I leave, no room to evade
Gettin' out, that I doubt, so prepare to be slaved
You're neither here nor there, I'm number uno, priority
Rhymes are so smooth, groove shows my authority
Shanté, me, Bizzy and Kane are her protégés
Takin' out Rush you know why? We know the way
We're down with the Juice, don't you think that's virtue?
Dare to make fun of us and one of us'll hurt you
Whoever's the closest, I mean that the nearest will
Remove so many rappers you be callin' us Clearasil
I feel free now that I cleared this
How could I fell off, boy, I helped pioneer this",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-i-pioneered-this-lyrics
Beat Biter,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Let me rock this rhyme only if I may
It's directed to my man LL Cool J
Your brand new jam sure does sound sweet
You ""Rocked the Bells"" but you stole my beat
Me and Marley Marl, we designed it well
You added some percussion, thought we could not tell
It will be my glory to tell this story
It will even be rocked in your territory
Think they're so slick that they can't be greased
What I really hate most be biting MC's
To make their own would be a total waste
Let me tell you what happened in this one case
Turned on the radio station of my choice
When I heard my beat with the next man's voice
Put it on tape and I played it again
It just couldn't be, so I asked my friend
He didn't wanna hurt my feelings, so he said ""I guess""
Played it one more time, homeboy said ""yes""
I got so mad that I wanted to scream
But I sat and wrote a rhyme to release my steam
It just so happened that we met some place
I confronted this beat biter face to face
I asked did he do it and of course he denied
So I had to say, homeboy, I let that slide
To this here story there is no end
I'm just waiting for the sucker kid to do it again
I was just so shocked when I heard his cut
I called his girl everything but a sleazebag slut
Beat biters I devour like a three course meal
So be careful next time whose beat you steal
That's not really what this song is about
But if you steal my beats, I'm taking you out
The lyrics that I use in my rhymes are so nice
You press rewind and say, ""Man, I got to hear that twice""
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Saying things like that, you must be sick
I feel sorry for those souls, it really makes me sad
Telling stories of the battles that they never had
I'm the root - my rhyme the tree
As essential to my mind as my eyes must see
I expand one's thoughts to the very extreme
Have you thinking something's real when it's only a dream
If I was a perpetrator I'd feel ashamed
Putting silly words together that all sound the same
If they elected Presidents for fresh rhymes that they wrote
I'd be the winner hands down, they'd abolish the vote
Because I'm quiet at times don't mean I don't have heart
I be praying half the time please, don't let me start
Cause once I start I'm gonna cold get ill
And at times it takes a posse just to make me chill
I say, brother, let's do this right
First we'll drink tea, and then we'll fight
So what I made a jam on the mellow side
It was something worthwhile, so I kept my pride
Now that my neck is out of the noose
Rock parties so hard that you gotta get loose
When you were just a kid with your runny nose
With your everlasting sneakers and your bummy clothes
Before you ever thought of making rap your trade
You were dreaming of Adidas while I got paid
Now you're sitting there wondering how I know
About the days when you used to be an MC ho
People souped you up, told you you were nice
Not only rock 'em once, rock your weak rhymes twice
For guys like you they should create an award
For the most attempts and the least that scored
See, I'm a rhyme writer, Marley mixes my cuts
I adore fly girls and I spit on sluts
I hold the rap population in the palm of my hand
Little children saying, ""Ma, I wanna be like Shan""
I got the knowledge to know, the wisdom to speak
The understanding of my rhymes is at its fullest peak
There were a lot of MC's that tried to riff
But they wound up on the slabs as an MC stiff
No typographical errors, God bless the dead
Don't take it too light, these things I said
Final judgment over all like a full-fledged king
So my sentence to death, others never to sing
I'm chilling for the moment, yes, my friend
In a minute I be making six g's times ten
This might put you in a state of shock
It's not how much you make, it's how good you rock
Just to let you know who's DJ's greater
Marley'll wax, buff and Simonize Cut Creator",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-beat-biter-lyrics
Words of a Freestyle,Born to Be Wild,1988,"The microphone stand is where I make my escape
Out of the blue I see some dope rhymes that I shoulda take
I used to say em off the top of my head, man, could I drop a
Megaton bomb that was odd to stop, a
Movin train, hope I don't have to explain
That any rapper step in my way, he's bound to be slain
The stage is the court, I'm the judge and the juror
And when rappers pass me by they should Heil to the Führer
Although you may hate me and down to degrade me
There's some suckers walkin 'round tryin to cold imitate me
Never cursin or rehearsin cause I'm so versatile
And you can tell by these words it's a freestyle

MC's I wipe out and rub them, don't care if you love them
And I wish you placed my name ?that flies? way up above them
Each and every show I do ends with applause
Here's lookin at you, kid, now go for yours
And if you choose not to, then I'm gonna take it
A night you'll never forget: it's just what I make it
And it won't take long for me to sing a new song
Because the key to gettin paid is you should never prolong
See my mind is set to automatically jet
You can't name the day you seen me let a mic pass yet
Once the microphone is mine I start by thankin you greatly
And you haven't heard of anybody duffin us lately
Never cursin or rehearsin cause I'm so versatile
You can tell by these words it's a freestyle

Just take another look at this one tough cookie
And could never be duffed by a new jack rookie
See, before I came with an MC name
And I feel sorry for the rapper that tries to proclaim
Because you won't have a chance and you will need advancin
Marley hasn't made a beat yet that wasn't enhancin
As a matter of fact I keep my rhymes intact
Severly's how you get served for callin me wack
Never again, I'm reminiscin
Last rapper in the world you should think about dissin
Cause my lyrics are burnin, Marley's tables are turnin
And ?sufficiant? we give suckers are watchin and learnin
MC Shan and Marley Marl and we're respected so greatly
And you haven't heard of anybody duffin us lately
Never cursin or rehearsin cause I'm so versatile
And you can tell by these words it's a freestyle

I come runnin when the microphone calls
Say a few ???, say ???, say ho and yes yes y'all
It gotta be ill cause I don't write no frill
You used to love to hear the story and you always will
We put the B, the B, the Bridge on p-plastic
??? like ???
But the ??? made the jivva-jivva-jam c-classic
Come to think about it, we're respected so greatly
And you haven't heard of anybody duffin us lately
Never cursin or rehearsin, I'm so versatile

Hip-hip-hop	(2x)
There is no implication hip-hop is wrong
Beats tapped out, played back in songs
Consider hip-hop as a verbal sport
It brings pleasure while expressin one frame of thought
Those that don't like it, then you're psychotic
To my point of view hip-hop's exotic
Rhymes being written everytime you blink
With no vital signs of becoming extinct
Try to demolish, it will not be worth
Killing all hip-hop fans on earth
Don't try to compare it, there's no relative
The word to describe hip-hop: creative
Once you're at a party you're in hip-hop's lair
To downgrade art, how could one dare?
Once upon a time they used to play soul
From there they went to rock 'n roll
Rock died down, then along came pop
Now you're livin in the world of hip-hop

I am the creator of my hip-hop style
With a level of college understood by child
Hip-hop is being moved on a one-way course
Up and being led by an unseen force
You try to hold it down, won't be no good
The more it gets exposed, the more it gets understood
It's all fantasy, yet all realistic
Often complicated, other times simplistic
Lyrics so sharp, they can cut like a knife
I'm sworn by oath to the hip-hop life
Less live drums, less guitar strumming
Hip-hop is the life of the up and coming
Not by force, by one's own choice
Persuaded by the beat and the MC voice
There are people who love it across the land
And there are those that think that it should be banned
Well I say I love it, it comes from my heart
Very thankful for the day that it got its start
Now that it got started, you see it won't stop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

The only thing you could do that would make me mad
Is take away my pen and my hip-hop pad
Take that away, I have nothing left
So let it go free or sentence me to death
I know you had troubles with your moms and dad
When you were growin up goin through your childhood fad
Some parents think that hip-hop means
Wearin fat shoe laces and name brand jeans
It really doesn't matter just what you say
Hip-hop will be around till you're old and grey
They're just all lies created by nerds
You think that I'm playin, you mark my words
Just like man sends rockets to Mars
Hip-hop living is ascending to stars
The more it gets accepted, you'll see it won't drop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop
Runnin neck to neck in the music world race
You don't have to listen if it isn't your taste
It's becoming worldwide, internationally known
Have you ever heard the saying 'to each his own'?
People like jazz, cause that's their taste
I prefer crisp highs with an earthquake bass
There are hip-hop songs that make you tense
And then there are those not worth 2 cents
But still hip-hop's gonna make its mark
Cause you used to only hear it in your neighborhood park
To all non-believers, you should know your name
Since the parks, don't you see how far the hip-hop came?
It's been around for years, and you ask yourself how?
For the very same reason that you're listening now
You might have been hooked from the very first line
Cause raps like these cultivate one's mind
One day your resistance level might drop
And you'll admit: it's a world of hip-hop

"Jane, Stop This Crazy Thing!",Down By Law,1987,"(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)
She was this girl that I know named Jane
She used to be cool, now the girl's insane
Now all Jane does is walk around all day
Sayin, ""Beam me up, Scotty, take me away!""
Now I remember Jane from back in the day
When she used to go to school, get all straight A's
Now you see Jane on the street corner
Stoppin every car anytime she wanna
Whatever went wrong, the facts remain
But who could think this woulda happen to sweet old Jane
(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)
Jane's life story was a tragic one
She started gettin high, cause she said it was fun
There was no party, just a meeting of friends
And then the question arose: who got ends?
It went around, they had 300 in all
Somebody yelled out: ""We're gonna have a ball!""
Steve grabbed the money and ran down the block
Came back and said, ""Y'all, take a look at this rock!""
Jane was gettin into somethin heavy that night
""Hurry up quick, somebody give me a light!""
 said ""Hold it!"", he was pullin too fast
But Jane was amused by the smoke in the glass
She was tickled to death at the faces they made
""Puttin fire to the glass, don't you think it won't break?""
In a flick of a flash the torch was lit
She put it to her mouth, and she took a hit
Smoke rushed from her lungs and up to her brain
This was the beginning of the end of Jane
(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)
Jane got weak, and the bass got strong
What she used to do right, Jane now does wrong
I walked past one day, called my man Jack
She almost broke her neck cause she thought I said ""crack""
It had to be a week since I seen her that day
But the body that she had just wasted away
When she used to walk by, we used to say she looked chill
But now as she passes, everybody go (ill!)
The girlie we saw hop off Mercedes Benz
She was on it so hard, she started stealin from friends
To all the drug dealers she was so in debt
That she sold her VCR and her TV set
Jane used to live the life as the storybook tells
Now everything she gets, she eventually sells
Sneak around the corner when you see Jane comin
She'll be touchin on your clothes, the girl be crumbin
(Jane, stop this crazy thing!)	(2x)
If you know a girl who was the quiet type
Who acts kinda funny and a bit too hype
These kinda actions only mean one thing
She's only buggin like that cause she's suckin the thing
Not only the girls, it can happen to guys
But the fellas try to beat you, then they greet you with lies
One day Jane coulda been my honey
I just couldn't wait till the girl made 20
I see her nowadays, and all I do is sing

Project Ho,Down By Law,1987,"Listen close to the story I'm about to tell
It will never be repeated, so listen well
And if you been around the way, some of you might know
This girl we label as the project ho
If you look half decent and if you kick it right
She was bound to be yours for at least a night
See, I was introduced to her by my cuz
But that was before he told me who or what she was
Me not knowing about this freak
Pulled her off to the side and began to speak
She had jet-black hair, big brown eyes
She seemed to be smart conversation-wise
I said, ""You look so good, as a matter of fact
Here's my number, I ain't home, baby, call me back""
I didn't know if she was poor or filthy rich
Cause my cousin didn't tell me nothing 'bout the bitch
One thing I did know, I'm gonna get my thrill
Then I cold stepped off, and said, ""Baby, you chill""
You know that old saying if you're slow you blow?
She was fast, so they labelled her the project ho
I heard stories on the things that they said she'd do
But when I seen her, I said, ""Nah, it can't be true""
She was fair game, so I thought I'd play
And never in my life will I forget this day
I was chilling one night, I was all alone
Nodding off but awakened by the ring of the phone
To protect the guilty party cause they might have been stemmed
We won't say her name, so we'll just say Kim
When I heard her, goose-pimples ran up my skin
I said, ""Hi, how you're doing and how have you been?""
She said, ""I'm doing fine, I hope you're doing the same
Do you know who I am?"", ""Yeah, I remember your name""
I thought deep down that I peeped the card
Kept saying to myself she was on it hard
I tried to be nice, tried to treat her kind
But she had only one thing on her mind
It always happens, well, wouldn't you know
She said, ""I see you later, cause I got to go""
My cousin came home and said, ""Are you some fool?
Being seen in the streets with a garden tool""
I loooked up at him, cause I did not know
He said, ""Kim, that skeezer, she's the project ho""
Me myself thought homie was dissin'
Despite all that I did not listen
Wouldn't you believe it, she called me again
And this was the line that I kicked her then:
""I'd love to see you, girl, and I don't know why
Don't try to play post, cause you know you're fly
So I'd like to come and see you if I may""
I was surprised as you when she said, ""Okay""
Now that that part was over and done
""Baby, what do you do at times to have fun?""
""Depending on the weather and my mood that day
Sip Dom Perrignon at a Broadway play""
The other things are not good to mention
Like coming to my crib and relieve my tension
I told her I was in love from the day we met
After talking for hours Kim said, ""Bet""
I had to let her go just to clear my line
""So I'll see you on Friday, let's say about 9""
From the things she said, why didn't I know
The girl on my line was the project ho
I took her out - fine's how it went
But I better get something for the dough I spent
Turned on the radio and heard (a world premiere)
Turned to her and said, ""Where we go from here?""
The best part of it all, the thing that made it so treach
The colors we wore were the same as the stretch
I recognized the look that was on her face
And I yelled to the driver, ""Homeboy, my place""
We made it there in at least a half
I got a choice of wines and a jaccuzzi bath
You'll scream when I tell you what homegirl said
""Show me to the room with the king-sized bed""
I was rested real well, so I felt strong
I knocked those boots that whole night long
Right after she left, I started to itch
Then I thought of what happened, then I said, ""That bitch!""
I went to see the doctor later on that day
Cause when something is wrong, Jack, I don't play
The doctor came over, this is what he said:
""You can't cure it with soup or laying up in your bed
You're lucky that you came to see me early, my man
Cause I guess that you know that you got it, Shan""
I said, ""Well, my man, that only goes to show
Believe 'em when they tell you she's the project ho""",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-project-ho-lyrics
Down By Law,Down By Law,1987.0,"My name is MC Shan, my destiny is the stars
Being driven around in the freshest cars
All his beats and my rhymes are chill
Now I'm back once again ready to get ill
The beat's not fake, the rhyme's hardcore
My name is MC Shan and I'm down by law
There's been this rumor going around
About low life crabs saying I ain't down
But all MC's will feel my wrath
The system is my power the mic is my staff
I have the power of command, the power of lust
After battles all papers read
(Another one bites the dust)
All across the country I know I'm hated
Not only by crews I've devastated
Don't ask how I know, I just can tell
By the tone of your voice as you wish me well
Filled with so much envy that your face turns green
Cause my name rings bells on the Hip Hop scene
So pull out a bottle let the champagne pour
Fly rhymes so that makes me down by law
(Another one bites the dust)
Creeping across the nation like a midnight storm
Always rock a jam every time I perform
Records I make are not distorted
Made in New York and not imported
Have never been known to make an error
Crews see me coming, their heart fill with terror
Dip out the back when I step on the scene
Watch the back door, you'll see what I mean
I love to rock a party every time I can
My DJ's Marley Marl and I am MC Shan
We make the freshest jams that you've ever heard
Marlon ain't we down?
(Word!)
Now that we've come to the very end
His beats my rhymes are a perfect blend
We are the ones all others admire
To be like us is their desire
Never get angry always stay calm
Yet do as much damage as a nuclear bomb
Do or say anything we may
We destroy all objects in our way
As expensive as diamonds, precious as pearls
Rap so strong, take all y'all girls
Make cold cash money, do much much more

Cocaine,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now, this is what happened but I wasn’t upset
See, it all started with this girlie I met
I really liked this girl, but she made me sad
‘Cause she almost made me trick off every dime I had
Now listen to this story that I have in store
‘Cause it talks about this girl you mighta met before
See, I was chillin’ at a party, I was out gettin’ loose
When me and this young lady was first introduced
She was lookin’ so sweet, a glitter came to my eye
They said they’d call sucker if I let her pass by
What I felt inside from that very first night
We were a perfect couple ‘cause she made me feel right
From that day, all my hopes and dreams were lost
The more she came around, the more she started to cost
Then she got me to the point, I feel so down
Each and every time that she wasn’t around
Well, lotsa times when she’s around, I often sigh
‘Cause she had me in control and I didn’t know why
I shoulda cut her off, that woulda been smart
But I found it really hard for us to part
With a heart as cold as mine, I feel that’s a shame
Every time I turn my back on her, she called my name
(Shan) (repeated a bunch of times)
I would always regret the first day we met
I wanted her so bad, she had me dripping with sweat
Every time I came home, she had me tricking my pay
And when I told her that I love her, she had nothing to say
She drove me so crazy, stone outta my mind
She beat me so bad, my rent was months behind
I finally see she had me caught in her own little way
So I tried to get her back just by staying away
But when I used to feel good, she had me singing her chant
See, I tried to stay away but I found that I can’t
I went to see her, copped a plea, why I don’t have a friend
You do me right, my love, that’s why I’m back to see you again
All the days that I was gone, I was going through hell
My heart was beating so fast, my head started to swell
When I was by her side, I felt so secure
When I met this young lady, she was nice and pure
I don’t know what her reaction was on some
But when I kissed this girl, my mouth went numb
Now, from that point, I should have known
But my love for this girl since the day has grown
Girls like this are one of a kind
She’ll free your soul and clear your mind
Stay away from this girl, take my advice
She’s as pure as snow, her heart is cold as ice
I was under spell, she had my brain
Don’t you know by now that her name was cocaine
Stay away from this girl if you wanna stay sane
She’ll pick your pockets and damage your brain
Girls like this really ain’t no joke
She’ll only be yours ‘til the day you go broke
If you see her on the streets, don’t give her a grin
‘Cause it won’t be long before she sucks you in
So before you have a problem that you can’t solve
With tricky girls like this, don’t you get involved
‘Cause it will be a short time and you will be through
There’s no tellin’ what reaction she could have on you
To some, this girl is just a passing phase
And she’s even made some cold change their ways
From doctors, studying the medical books
Into big time liars and petty cash crooks
She doesn’t know when to stop, she'll take things too far
You’ll be pawning your gold as well as selling your car
She’ll be your friend, oh me, oh my
Up until the day that the well runs dry
That’s right, you heard just what I said
‘Til the well runs dry or your ass drops dead
She’ll change your life, you’ll say ‘dag-nab-it’
She’ll just turn out to be another bad habit
So please take heed to the things I’ve said
And never let this girl mess with your head
Stay away from this girl if you wanna stay sane
She’ll pick your pockets and damage your brain
Girls like this really ain’t no joke
She’ll only be yours ‘til the day you go broke",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-cocaine-lyrics
Go For Yours (’Cause I’m Gonna Get Mine),Born to Be Wild,1988.0,"I'm myself called a hood because I walk with a limp
Would you believe they even call my boy a hip-hop pimp?
Like Dr. King I had a dream, I couldn't sleep too long
If I had to stand alone, I'd still be strong
Men are all equal, we're the Father's creation
What used to be the distant land is now my nation
How long will it be, how many suckers must die?
There's only one answer to the question why
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, 'cause I'ma get mine

Unalike's attract and a-alike's repel
And if you buy dead dreams I got plenty to sell
All the money in the world couldn't buy my knowledge
My teacher was experience, the streets was college
It's a shame that many had to learn this way
So I never take the word of what the next man say
Head-a-arm-arm-a-leg-a-leg-a
Supreme High Being, Sole Controller, not a beggar
My true manifestation of Shan
I never fell, I held my destiny within my hand
On the day that I was born I received strike one
Because my culture was an Asiatic native son
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

My foundation is strong, so I had to destroy
Do y'all remember Cheetah, that was Tarzan's boy
My main motto is self-satisfaction
Life's a movie with no cuts, all straight up action
If you roll as a sucker, then a sucker you die
And six feet up above you is the heavenly sky
I haven't heard of any comin' back to tell
Dyin' must be heaven, cause livin' is hell
You sit around and wait for your wish to be granted
And the next thing you know you're being buried and planted
Your body is the temple, the brain is the center
A door to explore, but you're scared to enter
Mind means many in need of direction
And the dictionary listed in the poverty section
You're nothin' but a novel on a bookstore shelf
And see the title of mine reads: ""Think for Self""
My knowledge is the sun and it will always shine
You better go for yours, cause I'ma get mine

You say you're sick and tired of bein' rejected
And you think you do better bein' crime-connected
Just for example let's say that you're twenty
Got a Benz, fly girls and doo-doo money
Moms ask: ""Where you get it?"" What you gonna tell her?
You dropped out of school, became a drug seller
You say you knew what you were doin', you say you were smart
Next week they beat you down and bust a cap in your heart
Your knowledge is the sun, you better let it shine
No matter what you do with yours, I'ma teach mine",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-go-for-yours-cause-im-gonna-get-mine-lyrics
A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste,Colors (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"Gangs usually roll as a savage pack
Once sworn in, there's no turnin back
Initiation, manhoods are tested
Do crime, you'll fail by becoming arrested
Get beat down the line, cautiously steppin
Always watchin your back with your hand on your weapon
You blink for a minute and get brutally beaten
Every time you diss the colors it will keep on repeatin
When you say you knew somebody that was a gang member
You can't say you know him, you can only remember
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you wanna be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste
Just a walk on the block, they tell you it costs
Willingly pay - or be forced
Once your color is set you gotta be stern
A bad influence for the young that are eager to learn
The rules of a gang is fightin and killin
Did you ever stop to think that was blood you were spillin?
Duckin from the cops most the time
Because you live life devoted to crime
Gangs are mainly based on colors and races
Not everywhere, just in particular places
Hang on the corner or on the stoop
Fightin people lookin just like a terrorist group
Gangs give a rank at society level
Wear a tatoo skull with the mark of the devil
You have to live life all nervous and worried
But joinin a gang means you wanna be buried
It's either that or jail cause there's no other place
And a mind is a terrible thing to waste
No turnin back 
Had many bad dreams, nights stayin awake
Joinin a gang was the fatal mistake
Just to fill your head with knowledge till your mind goes blank
And rumble with boys and dispose of the shank
GANG can be spelled with capital letters
Yo, while you're sweepin the streets, does it make you feel better?
Some gangs lack action, they're basically talk
Until their brains get scattered on the sidewalk
Your obligation is to serve as a marionette
And by society you're treated like a homeless pet
You wanna live the life of crime doin negative things
When Al Capone died, so did gangster kings
To live the life of a gangster is all out of place
Because a mind is a terrible thing to waste
Gangs are always violent but jail is rough
You go a man and you may leave a cream puff
You say you do crime cause you're poverty stricken
And so is everybody that you're robbin and vickin
Gangs ain't gonna be around much longer
If 5 out of 10 become mentally stronger
My mother said bein in a gang ain't nothin
I didn't listen to her cause I thought she was bluffin
I thank her from my heart that she stayed on my case
Made sure my mind didn't just become another waste",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-a-mind-is-a-terrible-thing-to-waste-lyrics
Juice Crew Law,Born to Be Wild,1988,"What's wrong with you, man?
You crazy!
Highly acclaimed that's Shan the epitome of rhymes
Can't dance so you can't get rid of me
Line after line there's cause and effect
But I first test the mic with the 1-2 check
The Hip Hop world made the Juice Crew orphans
Gained our respect sealing up much coffins
We're all obligated to Juice Crew Laws
You'se a perk if you let a man take yours
Number 2 is not to follow, yo, you must set trends
And if you ain't down with us, you can't be friends
Many of my so-called boys just flip
But the thrill of it all - you're on the tip
You should be glad there is no tricks
On ours so hard we wrote your name on our...
Mix after mix every record we make
Don't compare or scare, so I dare you to take
Any part of the rhyme or the 
kick drum sound
I be meeting you, defeating you and beating you down
My name rings bells and make rappers petro
God help you, kid, when I get upset, yo
The bass starts to roll bid your fans farewell
Cause the chance of you winning is like snowing in hell
My rhymes say more than a tasket, a tisket
Too clever, yo, I never go out like a biscuit
Don't try to take my spot and not be legit
Try to fit my shoes and your feet won't fit
You're good, but compared to me you're not nearly
You think you can serve me? Come on, really
Til I can't breathe, yo, I'mma be with it
When I hear three words, you got it, I get it
My style is wild but strong and you're temporary
Violate the Juice Crew Laws and I bury
Send you to the land of peace and tranquility
Suckers have the knack but they lack my ability
Those who tried to dis in the days behind us
Back on the dick since the brothers signed us
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law
Never too alert but I'm always cautious
And a few of 'em own a few Mercedes and Porsches
Suckers get paid by means of extortion
My rhymes take your mind by means of abortion
Rhymes create wings that time can't fly on
The mic that you bring on stage you'll die on
Sit back and watch your life get jettisoned
If rhymes were juice I'd be Con Edison
Do as we say, not as we do, as a custom
A sucker tried to snatch my chain and I bust him
I didn't cuff him and read him no rights
I knocked out his service and turned out his lights
Be a fool if you want and let your boys divert you
Soup you up to battle me, kid, and I'll hurt you
Superior intellect made me a phenomenon
And I can go on and on and on and on
You can be blind but my rhymes still focus
A sucker tried to violate law and I broke his
Albums and tapes and his compact discs
And his boys stood around and said (yo, he dissed you, Kris)
Straight up not split by a hyphen
Cut you to pieces without putting a knife in
You won't bleed but you feel just the same
Now answer me right, boy, what's my name?
(Shan) These words are are small innuendo
Guaranteed to decipher the mice from the men though
Now that I have the power make a refinement
Revealing the snakes is my next assignment
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law
For those who betrayed me picture being afraid of me
A few I know wish they woulda never come played me
Though I'm decked in my suit you can't play me like rummy
Teach you how to rhyme, say Kris, dummy
The same theory if the words don't fit
Got the nerve to get on stage and wanna sing that...
Wait a minute, wait just a second
You know that's not my style - sorry, just checking
But don't it make you sick when they be kicking la-di-da-di
But I got what it take to make you wanna cold rock a party
Too hot to touch, too cold to hold ????? sadness
Junk you pop gets you dropped, stop the madness
My style is wild, my son, my child, selective
Built to stay tough, written rough and effective
I tangle ya, mangle ya, strangle ya and then maul ya
This goes for you and you and you and all ya
Make the mistake and I'm breaking your jaw
So don't ever dare violate Juice Crew Law",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-juice-crew-law-lyrics

It's been so long and I paid my dues
And with rhymes like these, yo, Shan can't lose
You won't believe the strange thought that ocurred to me
So intense, it absolutely startled me
I knew that I was buggin when I stopped walkin:
""I think that you should hear me, I'm your conscience talkin
If you don't wanna listen, hey, it ain't no thing
You rap for a living, but you wish you could sing
You think your life is complete, there's a lot that you're missing
You enjoy making music for the people to listen
Hip-hop is your life, by oath you've sworn
Now it's time to start the mission for which you were born
You've acquired a rep, now you're labelled a villain
But I don't really care, Shan'll always be chillin
That's why I'm tryin to say, that's just part of your style
You were (born to be) wild, wild""

I couldn't forget, no matter how I tried
But my conscience just wouldn't let a day go by
All day long I watched and observed
No, I gotta be jokin, that's word to Herb
I can take a lickin and keep on smilin
Who needs a license to ill, I was born to be wildin
Rhymes sweeter than a premium vintage grape
]From the paper I knew it'd sound dope on tape
Never in a rush, I'm Cold Chillin'
And the next perpetrator I find, I'm killin
Just ask your boys how many heads I flew
And that's why I roll with the Juice Crew
That voice in my mind taught me one lesson
I was born to be wild, and only suckers be fessin
I knew I had a purpose since the days of a child
I was (born to be) wild, wild

The meaning of 'wild' is not screaming and yelling
It's 'bout showing and proving and not showing and telling
All you counterfeit rappers, you might as well quit
You'll never hear me say I'm bad, bein wild is the shit
Rap symbol, and never been defeated yet
If rap is a crime, how much time I get?
The best impersonator couldn't copy my style
And even if he did, you know what I'd do, I'll -
As a matter of fact, it's what I already did
I pulled out a rhyme and cold blasted his lip
Most opponents get on, they're guilty as tried
They're diggin and stripped of whole manhood and pride
Don't be brave and save yourself half of the bill
You can't chop me with a saw cause your ass should chill
When they're slippin on the cuts I gracefully smile
Cause I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild

Born to be wild, I'm takin command
While you're performin people screamin out: ""We want Shan!""
I'm colder than ice and hot as a flame
And my rhymes are always clever, but they're never the same
What's wrong with your girl? Somebody ought to stop her
For bein in the presence of a low-life rapper
This rhymin was pressed as a special edition
I was born to be wild and you're the one on a mission
Allow me to say that I weaken resistance
Makin examples just to prove my mortal existence
Born to be wild means a prototype
And the roar of the crowd increases the hype
You have to be bold to try and steal my rhyme
Or even to dis cause you think that I'm
A sucker, a softie, or even a child
But I was (born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be) wild, wild
(Born to be)

Give Me My Freedom,Born to Be Wild,1988,"M.C. Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass this
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was Thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy - give me my freedom

I wanna break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim they're theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I dont need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my freedom

I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my freedom

We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause Marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down, then the beats would catch it
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy
Jockin me, son
Jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid
Give me my
Give me my
Give me my freedom
Give me my freedom or not
I DON'T GIVE A F-
You don't wanna play this?
Suck my -
Fuck off, muthafuckas
You don't like this?
I don't give a fuck
Just gimme my muthafuckin freedom

Where I come from, we never heard of bite
We can write the freshest rhymes at the speed of light
All my planet, we're the real McCoy
And it's you Earth MC's that I wish to destroy
When I rhyme I'm never out of place
I take you on a voyage through outer space
Every rap I make, you know it always sells
I fly the galaxy wearin laser Cazals
I can fly from place to place quicker than you can snap
I'm known as the space wizard of rap
Depend on how I feel, if it's only for fun
I take my mic off of 'kill' and I set it to 'stun'
Sometimes my rhymes do inflict pain
Sends electrical impulses through your brain
In your Earthling ears my rhymes are caught
Transmitted to your brain is what's known as thought
I can see the devastation as I look in your face
Listen to how the deejays rock up in space

To call yourself MC, are you out of your mind?
You have to have a golden voice similar to mine
But when you have a jam that is cold set
You play the same old records, one right after the next
For you to win the battle, Earth will have no chance
With the spinning of two records, and you call that advanced?
To do that on my planet you'd be taking a risk
Because the beats we play out live, and that's not on a disc
The first time that they see it, they might be amazed
And say, ""Why should we commit ourselves to permanent waste?""
That's why it is impossible for us to lose
Plug in the microchip of any beat that we choose
One thing where Earth and my people might match
That is the similarity and sound of the scratch
We have stamina, and also have poise
The only difference is our scratch is no sonic noise
To take Earth MC's out is what I wish to achieve
Once this is accomplished I be destined to leave
When I leave they'll call me an ace
That cool MC from outer space

Although my color just might be green
I'm the flyest space MC that you ever seen
It might be in your future cause it can't be your past
But the reign of Earth MC's don't have too long to last
All you fresh MC's, you should feel ashamed
The wack around the world, you put em down with the game
They get on the mic and be coppin a plead
About how good they rock on the m-i-c
On my planet you must take a test
I'm at the top of my class because I'm the best
I use my rhyming skills for what it is worth
That's why I'm here to battle all MC's of Earth
If you take me out which ain't been done before
You might just start a interplanetary war
The war won't be to kill John and Steven
The whole point of it is to get even
The war's to get even, I will say indeed
And I will come back every year till the day I succeed
I hope I didn't stand here and offend you too much
If you ever wanna battle, then get in touch
So I can come back and dis your face

She’s Gone,Born to Be Wild,1988,"(She's gone)
You know, even though we're far apart so many miles away
My love for you grew stronger with each passing day
And it seems just like yesterday, baby, since I met you
And from the moment I seen you, I knew I had to get you
You know, cause sweet girls, they're one of a kind
And you just simply blew my mind
And a love like ours, yo, that wasn't easy to find
And yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)
You know, I cherished every moment we spent
Wishin it would never end
Just when I had told myself
That damn, I'll never fall in love again
Cause love can lead you blind
See, it snuck me up from behind
And before I knew girl, I was yours and you were mine
Our love had a value that love just couldn't buy
And I knew that you were true just by that twinkle inside your eye
And yet I bless the day she was born
But I still can't face the fact that (she's gone)
You know, I met many girls around the nation
But see, I just knew that you were there, and I wanted to share my relations
And I loved you like I do for so many reasons
And since you been gone ain't really nothin changed but the seasons
Things are different without you but I can tell you are still the same
I wake up and find myself screamin out your name
But yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)
You know, just to be close to you, that all that I miss
You know, I used to get chills up and down my spine each time we kissed
And how much it thrills me just to talk to you on the phone
Next best thing to being there but I still feel alone
You know, it had to be love, at least it was in my case
Cause every time I close my eyes, damn, I still see your face
But yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)
I did every thing that I could just to make you happy, and Lord knows I tried
I'm in so much pain my boys can still see it in my eyes
You know, I crossed through mountains, travelled over the great divide
Just to show and prove to you all the love that I held inside
You know, you gave me love, you know, more happiness that a man could find
And yo, and forever I woulda been yours if forever you woulda been mine
But yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)
Yo, ain't nothin like the good old days, the good old days
You know
Just can't face the fact that you're gone, sweetheart
Why?
Why?
Did everything that I could
Keep you happy
And all that, you know?
But everything I did musta not been good enough for you
You still wanted more
And I mean, hey, what more can you have?
To me, love is everything
Everything is love
And I was giving you all of mine and I expected the same in return
And I got shitted on
Youknowmsayin?
But it's alright though sweetheart
It don't matter
Life goes on, everything goes the same
But still and all I still can't the fact that she's gone",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-shes-gone-lyrics
Back To The Basics,Born to Be Wild,1988.0,"It might've took a while
But you knew I had to hit you with a brand new funky rhyme
Guess you already know, so I'm ready to go
Marlon, hit me with the beat one time
Right now I'm gonna introduce myself
So y'all know just who I be
All you suckers in the house stay quiet as a mouse
Instead of Shan call me Mr. MC
I'm goin back to the basics
When I was just a young boy, who ever would've thought
I'd grow up to be an MC
But my rhymes are so nice that they paid my price
Because fortune and fame ain't free
These words I'm recitin are written in a style
That you ain't heard in a long time
And a song like this'll make a rapper reminisce
About the days when he was in his prime
I ain't never lost no battles yet
What made you think I would?
How many times does it take, all the rappers I break
And you still don't think I'm good
This girl in my class tried to move too fast
When she tried to pull down my zipper
Well, things got strange when the whole scene changed
And I all out tried to strip her
Teacher stepped in between, sent me straight to the Dean
That's where I thought my journey ended
Call your moms up to school, are you some fool?
And forget about bein suspended
You went back to the basics
Here's the story on how I got started
Yes, way back in the day
With my man Infinite, Jazzy , Akim
And fly girl Roxanne Shant
People used to hear that our crew was nice
But rappers just had to be convinced
And those who walked through 12th Street tried to say a rhyme
You seen or heard from em since
We sent em back to the basics
Yes yes y'all, it's like this y'all
MC Shan with a brand new twist y'all
One day when me and Marley Marl was playin in a ditch
We made this jam that we knew would slam
And some day it would make us rich
Marley Marl had B-36 bass bottoms
And he cut you up on the spot
And with my rhymes combined all the papers got signed
And 'The B-B-B-B-Bridge' got dropped
We went back to the basics",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-back-to-the-basics-lyrics
Another One to Get Jealous Of,Down By Law,1987.0,"Me and Marley Marl, we are resented, ya know?
Because of the beats and the rhymes we invented
To cold dis another's a thing that we love

I sit back and puff a spliff of buddha bless
See, in days of old mi rhyme went gold
The music, it wasn't recommended
Man used to sit on seat and tap out a beat
And went away feeling relieved
Hey ya
But soon after our rhyme is invented
And put together, it sound contented
And rhymin a-fi work
I tell you rhymin, yes it a-fi work
Bang-dang-dilli-dilli-dilli
MC's, dem like to bite the things you say
Others come along and like the beats you play
You know that's cold considered a dissin of work, ya know?
I don't deal with negativity and thing and thing
I'm the MC, and I'm also cool
Jacuzzi in my crib size of your pool
Sent di butler for my midnight treat
Rug so plush ya can't see ya feet
If ya come and visit if you choose
It's a must at the door that you leave your shoes
Don't obey and you'll have to go
Some didn't listen till my gun went bo!
Rock the house a little bit
Rub-a-dub
Michigan and Smiley
And di Yellowman
And MC Shan and Marley
Ya know
The house is packed every place I play
But let me tell ya bout this jam one day
]From the very first time I walked through the door
I see the people rub-a-dubbin on the floor
Played the wall, a man came past
Oh my God, dem puttin fire to glass!
I dipped, I bobbed, I weaved, I shook
I hear ya puff it one time and from there you're hooked
It make you sell your car, your house, your ring
Have you flying through the clouds and you don't have wings!
He passed it to me, I said, ""No,"" him said, ""Why?""
My boy jumped up and said, ""I'll give it a try""
]From the very first time he ignited the flame
My homeboy wasn't actin da same
I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, ""Let's go""
He looked at me and replied with, ""No""
I said, ""Fuck it,"" and left him there
The torch, the pipe, the base, the chair
I came back five days from then
To my surprise I seen my friend
To let you know what this thing does
He was sitting in the very same spot he was
I walked over, ""Want more?"" he said
Pipin hot my man dropped dead
His head hit the table, the pipe hit the floor
But I'll mention that di man won't base no more!
Bo!

Hey man, let me tell ya, man
True story, no bloodclot
Man fall and when his head hit the floor, man (unintelligible)... bass pipe
Everyone cried for the coroner
Go and pick up him pipe and said
""Man, dem leave em on the floor just like he lay, ya know?""
Picked up da crumb and put it in di pipe and he fuckin bliss off da ting off, man
Oh my God, bloodclot!
Man puttin fire to di glass thing, man

Hip Hop Roughneck,UnKnown,UnKnown,"That damn OJ
Tellin me my joint ain't comin out till '94?
OJ gotta be out of his mind, man
I'm tellin you, I'ma blow up in '93, man
They can't stop me
You crazy?
Word up
Tellin you
Yeah boy
Back in '93
To blow up once again on the hip hop scene
You know who it is, the one with the choice voice

Watch me rip up shop
Cause I'm the type of rapper you despise risin to the top
Ryhmin with the force that's knockin down barricades
Callin Mr. Loverman singin girls serenades
Try to lay low - unfamiliar
Just like smokin I'm bad for your health, I could kill ya
Think I'm bluffin, wanna find out?
Then I pull the trigger to the nine and blow your muthafuckin mind out
A murder I slay, so don't sleep
The mic leave threads across your face like thee tracks from a jeep
Your coffin is your final refuge
Your death is gonna have to be revenged by your nieces and nephews
Beat you like Tyson, slice you like a butcher
Six feet underground's most likely where I put ya
I get the place in an uproar
Make you wonder what you got your little weak wack ass up for
Rhymes, I got em in excess
And I got the beats that you pump in your Jeeps and your Lexus
Lyrically I boast and I swagger
Words pierce your mind, after a while starts feelin like a steel dagger
Slice, slice, slice, dice, dice, chop, chop, chop
Look like maintenance got another mess to mop
It's '93 and I gets nuff respect
Cause I ain't nothin but a hip hop roughneck

Nobody bring your firearm
You can't do no harm
Nobody can try to come test we
Nobody bring your firearm
You can't do no harm
Don't flex with MC Shan, ya can't test we

(So whutcha want nigga, so whutcha want nigga?)
Boy, you better slow down or get your life wrecked
(So whutcha want nigga, so whutcha want nigga?)
Tryin to mess around with the hip hop roughneck
(So whutcha want nigga, so whutcha want nigga?)
Boy, you better back up or get your life wrecked
(So whutcha want nigga, so whutcha want nigga?)
Cause ain't nobody that can win me in my neck of the woods
(So whutcha want nigga, so whutcha want?)

Shan was dead, but now I got reanimated
Had the buttons to push, but didn't know how to operate it
I'm in control of the ship now, captain
Boy, you wanna walk up and see yo what's happenin?
Some rappers think they're vicious
But at the end of it all they probably wind up doin dirty dishes
I'm risin up on an incline
And if your ass was that dope, then muthafucka, your ass woulda been signed
Ain't no goin by the book
You be just another wack muthafucka bout to get his shit took
Don't let the temper start to flare up
Cause that's when I start lookin around for shit that I can tear up
See, you don't pose a threat
Boy, we can go a few rounds, this ain't as rough as it can get
Adversaries avoid me
Many have approached, but never has one destroyed me
I'm not a force to be reckoned with
1-2, 1-2, then I start wreckin shiiieeet
I got nice, but it wasn't by accident
Necks were broke, boy, you wanna get your back bent?
Even though I'm not a girl you a-fi respect me
If you think I'm wrong, then come and correct me
It's '93 and I gets nuff respect
Cause I ain't nothin but a hip hop roughneck


Psych - I don't need you to proof-read
Ak is on the bassline givin me the lead (indeed)
Tip-tip-toein through the tulips as I follow
Blast a hole in your chest, now the shit's hollow
I drop knowledge but I also kick ballistics
I be kickin the funky lines that mystify the mystics
Won't think twice just to send a nigga the lullaby
The next nigga that steps might get bust in the eye
I stopped spreadin hookers like mayonnaise
Cause there's a lot of things that you can catch out there in this day and age
I'm not down with the homo clique
But I'll jump inside a nigga's ass quick
Fee-fee-fi-fiddy-fo-fiddy-fum
Laugh now nigga, you used to call me bum
Now I'm buried under money
Your girl's comin to see me on the side and I'm dippin in your honey
Knockin off heads in the game like a gladiator
Records so hot, they give heat like a radiator
Assume position cause you know the proceedure
Need somebody to follow? Then let me lead ya
Now it's time to rejoice
Cause now you got another funky record that's kickin with the Shan's voice
It's '93 and I get nuff respect
Cause I ain't nothin but a hip hop roughneck

Time for Us to Defend Ourselves,"Play it Again, Shan",1990.0,"Tales from the rhymeside, fact or fiction?
I look at justice as pain infliction
Sit back, relax while I bust this
There's a big loophole in justice
Law enforcement to serve and protect
But in my neighborhood they break your neck
Police are ruthless-minded, wicked and villainous
But not just I see you're killin us
What about the parents of the kid y'all killin'?
Better yet that's blood you're spillin'
Not doin' anythin' wrong, so catch me
Sellin' dope records? Boy, snatch me
Sunny days, my dark clouds lifted
You fail to understand that I'm poetically gifted
Knowledge ain't nuthin' but a book on your shelf
With justice in mind think deep to yourself
(If the government has refused to defend the negro)
(The descendants of slaves)
(It's time for us to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves)
(But you're advocating violence?)
(Time for us to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves)
(If the government has refused to defend the negro)
(Time) (Time for us to) (defend ourselves)

Contra's a code for police in the projects
Ready, to fly that head like an object
""Shan, you're makin' records, why you wanna stay there?""
That's where I was raised, and my son's gonna play there
Let me tell you what justice did
For a close friend of mine named Rich Kid
They ran a worn-out line that he snuffed 'em
Then he beat 'em down he and cuffed him
A gun and a badge gives a feeling of toughness
After subdued they continue with roughness
According to the laws of the land we're defenseless
Thinkin' that their jobs are beatin' you senseless
Takin' the names of fairytale props
There's one silly sucker called Robocop
The media skipped right past it
Robocop just put Rich in his casket
The bottom line: he wasn't under arrest
He needed ambulatory assistance for pains in his chest
If not for justice he would be in good health
May he rest in peace and think deep to yourself
(It's time for us to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves)
(If the government has refused to defend the negro)
(Time) (Time for us to) (defend ourselves)
(If the government has refused to defend the negro)
(The descendants of slaves)
(It's time for us to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves)
(But you're advocating violence?)
(Time for us to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves)

We all live with police brutality
They say it's false - no, it's reality
Not just a storyboard 'cause I live it
All I gotta say is somethin' must be done with it
See the cops, are sort of deranged
Think every fly car means drug change
They pull me over for a routine, check me
What he has in mind is to disrespect me
""Where'd you get the money for a fancy car?""
Got you sucker, what you know about rap, huh?
I'm just a young man tryin' to make it
Remember the name and don't ever mistake it
All you could say was when I passed by
Is, ""That's MC Shan, don't he look fly?""
Although you thought that civil rights died
You need to wake up and see it from the brightside

(If the government has refused to defend the negro)
(The descendants of slaves)
(It's time for us to do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves)
(But you're advocating violence?)

I Ran the Game,"Play it Again, Shan",1990,"A lil' lil' to make the ladies scream
This story is all about a tag team
The plot of the game was to jerk me
One would wind me, and the other would work me
These two were livin life triflin
To the point you would wanna get a rifle and
Blast their brains all the way to oblivion
Sweet Polly Pure and her homegirl Vivian
I first met em in the state of Wisconscin
When I caught ol' Vivy sneakin a peek at my Johnson
You could see that shine on my fronts
I said, 'Go for it, pal, cause you only live once'
I threw a quick glance at ol' Vivy
And she gave the eye that everything was splivy
The moment had arrived, I didn't wanna waste it
All choked up cause my eyes were pasted
On the bumps between her neck and her waistline
And I knew I had to hit her with a bassline
I said, ""I'd like to introduce me""
But I wasn't about to let ol' Polly and Vivy juice me
She said, ""I seen you clockin us
And I bet that you were thinkin 'bout knockin us
But if you had the chance, now would you?
Better yet, my man, now could you?
I said, ""I'ma tell ya, no sense lyin
I be damned if I didn't die tryin""
She said, ""I'm just kiddin, and we don't do that""
And I said, ""Sure, what train runs through that?""
Like a prospector stakin his claim
You mighta been dealin, but I ran the game
(Yo, yo, place your bets
Word up, I got the bank, yo
He-he-he, word to mother)
(Place your bets)
(Place your bets)
(Place your bets)
You mighta been dealin, but I ran game	(2x)

Now Polly wasn't into any regular ritz
With that big bold ass and them rhinestone tits
Just lookin at Vivy had me comin in excess
All I seen was horses on the plains of Texas
I asked them if they knew a place that I could rest at
Kinda hopin they would suggest that
But I still had doubts
And they said, ""Come on over to our house""
""Then it's to your place we step to
Here comes my ride, yo James, what kept you?""
I can still see the faces like a snap shot
Like they musta hit the jackpot
I could see em just sneakin and canivin it
The car was borrowed and my homeboy's drivin it
Some freaks, me and James drived past them
I was surprised how quick that gased em
""Before you put up the glass to divide, Sir
Are you planning to ride her?""
""Do we have to go through it?
Put the pedal to the metal, James, now do it""
Vivy sittin with her legs all cocked
I said, 'Goddamn, she gotta get her boots knocked'
Polly asked me where the bar was
And what else this car does
This car is boring and restless
Pussy invitations, I was now on the guest list
They made a few ice teas from Long Island
You're talkin 'bout a brother that's smilin
Like a prospector stakin his claim
You mighta been dealin, but I ran the game
(Yo, yo, place your bets
Word up, I got the bank, yo
He-he-he, word to mother)
(Place your bets)
(Place your bets)
(Place your bets)
You mighta been dealin, but I ran game	(2x)

Now Vivy had my limb hard as a bark
I was ready, I was set, and I was on my mark
Like a thoroughbred she was the gait
I yelled, ""Time, hold up, wait!""
Before I take my iron and I brand em and bond em
I revealed my super lubricated sensitive condom
She yelled out, ""Timber!"", and I said, ""Fall""
Damn, what the hell James gotta ring the phone for?
Just like a sucker he said he would bust me
""Chill, you're with it, homeboy, trust me""
Turned my back to fix the blind up
And in a glance they both were lined up
I had the whole world in the palm of my hand
And more pussy than a man could stand
Mile after mile I was stickin ol' Vivy
Polly on the side sayin, ""Gimme, gimme, gimme""
Up and down, doin it to death
Y'all better hold on, there's a lot more left
There I was, drivin it deeply
The tag was made and Polly yelled, ""Freak me!""
So I sent her on a far out trip
Kicked that 'don't you ever leave me on the lonely' tip
I had Polly and Vivy pinned to the mat
1-2-3, and they was out like that
They thought I was a sucker, Mr. Lollypop Man
On the bumps they would always say, ""Shan! Shan!""
They were probably thinkin Grants and Franklins
I'm surprised they didn't hear the change shanklin
Since they didn't, that's too bad
About 89 cents, and that was all I had
Now as for Polly and Vivy and their big-time talk
I left them drunk bitches on the sidewalk
Just like a prospector stakin his claim
You mighta been dealin, but I ran the game
(Place your bets)
(Place your bets)

You mighta been dealin, but I ran game	(2x)",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-i-ran-the-game-lyrics

M TOP - MAX... - MC Shan Lyrics - The Bridge Lyrics
Amazing!
Young and Sexy
After Shower Thoughts
Pen Spinning
Ladies and Gentleman
We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight
They just came from off tour and they wanna tell you a little story
About where they come from
The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge
You love to hear the story again and again
Of how it all got started way back when
The monument is right in your face
Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place
The Bridge(scratched) (3X)
Queensbridge
Hip hop was set out in the dark
They used to do it out in the park
Every place they said his name it rang an alarm
Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom
A brother whose known for his rap
Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last
A cool brother by the name of Gas
These brothers made you get loose
They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce
They used to jam in the center
You had to pay so you could enter
Go to the door
Get frisked
Just in order to get in
And if you wasn't from this town
Then you couldn't fight and win
But everytime they had a jam
They couldn't get no peace
So that's why the jam's out there
And the parks they had to cease cause you was in
The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge
Why don't you wise up
Show all the people in the place that you are bright
Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight
Cause that is one thing that we all must see done
And if you start some shit you're ass had better run
Cause you're in
The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge
Dimples be the girl, she was great
Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate
They used to rock it out in the place
And the title of it was sucker dj's
And then he strolled along one day
And then he walked into a girl named Shante
Third in line you know its me
MC Shan ha ha in the place to be
MC Man he made them beg
He is the man who is known as Craig
The newest member out to get loose
Now he is down with us and he got the juice
This is the place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn
Out
By any place any part of the world
And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl
When she's in
The Bridge(scratched) (8X)
Queensbridge
Dead dreams, bought and sold
You gotta try and receive your goal
However you do it however you're made
Don't ever listen to what ? say
Cause I will tell you the deal
You gotta go by what your heart feel
Cause if you don't you'll be misled
By stupid little things put inside your head
Or someone else that you will see
Their trying to live your destiny
By the time you think about it your grown
And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home
Grab hold of your heavy chain
Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain
You heard just what I said
They're always pullin ya back when you wanna get ahead
They pull you back cause their not wit it
You're talking about school
Their talking about quit it
Soon you'll see that time just fly
Cause you spent most of it out gettin high
Thought about it much, much later
Could've went to school and been much greater
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals
Stop walking through life as if you are blind
You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine
And i'm from
The Bridge(scratched) (4X)
Queensbridge
Keep on rockin
The bridge
Will keep rockin
If the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep rockin
If the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the bridge stop rockin
The kids will keep-a rockin
When the bridge stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
If the kids stop rockin
The bridge will keep-a rockin
Till the beat stop rockin
The bridge will keep rockin

Never Rock a Party,Born to Be Wild,1988,"Self-preservation, no warning alliance
And my rhymes are mainly based on mathematical science
I drink Moët on the rocks, Harvey's with Bristol
All about money and mics made out of crystal
My name will be praised, body preserved as a relic
More girlies than Bond, chillin harder than Selleck
Wanna live in a castle, with girls for romancin
Feedin me grapes while they're fanin me dancin
Crispy and fresh, never get spoiled
I'm takin a vow to be honest and loyal
I'm happy to announce me and rap are now wedded
And breakin the vow's a ground for bein beheaded
People travel for miles to get where I'm playin
I hate to disappoint em, homes, dig what I'm sayin?
I'm a knight in shinin armor, I rhyme, not joust
And I never rock a party, when I play, I house

Some rappers are wack and takin the credit
You knew who you are just as soon as I said it
On your burial grounds I'll inscribe my initials
This is what you get for tryin to pay the officials
MC's are like cards, they want you to play em
I like dungeons & dragons cause the plot is to slay em
My name'll carry on just like a tradition
My sons will be housin when I'm retired and fishin
I love to recite, say a rhyme and then spin it
Take it as a joke, but I'm in it to win it
Highly fortified, balanced, efficient
Never said a rhyme that wasn't sufficient
Biters nowadays, watch what you tell em
They might just take your rhyme, wanna rob you and sell em
I'm a knight in shinin armor, I rhyme, not joust
And I never rock a party, when I play, I house

I settle for tops, not takin no middles
Dope lines cause my mind's just as fit as a fiddle
MC destroyer, rulin the nation
Excuse me baby, would you like to take a dication?
So let it be said, so shall it be noted
I like to thank the fans that faithfully voted
I truthfully swear I'll never be lettin
Suckers keep rockin if I don't think they be jettin
Stripped to the bone, bare to the gristle
Worse than death, serve eternal dismissal
Never incited by slander or disses
Leave a blank for my name, I send plenty of kisses
Bound to go far, travel ??????
Debate Aristotle, question theories of Plato
Rappin is witty, the journey is rough
And categorized as simple teenage stuff
Achievin my goal, do better than rockin
With light in my eyes I can see who be clockin
I'm a knight in shinin armor, I rhyme, not joust
And I never rock a party, when I play, I house

Live in the jungle, survivin the boonies
The number of fans is even double the monies
My rhymes is devine, pure and untampered
No longer expect to be spoiled and pampered
You be cast in a bondage, emprisoned in cages
Not to be seen or even heard of for ages
Offenders remanded on dates of arraingment
A law for the rock house and that's entertainment
Rodents and rats, reptiles and lizards
MC's who proclaim to have the knowledge of wizards
All of the lowest hunted as pheasants
Like it or not, have to bow in my presence
I'll never be outwitted at the games I play
Took a break but you knew I'd be back someday
But truthfully you know it wasn't all that long
But knew my next jam had to be super strong
Dope rhymes are the reason that others hate me
That's why they make records tryin to down and degrade me
But nothin I can say, that's how it goes
They just better hope we never have no shows
I'm a knight in shinin armor, I rhyme, not joust
And I never rock a party, when I play, I house",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-never-rock-a-party-lyrics
So Def,Born to Be Wild,1988,"(So fresh)-- Roxanne Shant
I'm on the list and, my rhymes are crisp and
Me and rhymes are like a nose and Dristan
Without fail, everytime I
Get a dope idea for a rhyme I
Choose to save it or scrap it
See Marley for a beat and then rap it
I'm blessed by buddah, I'm not new ta
And sayin rhymes is what I do ta
Pass some of my free time away
Ask me why, and I'ma say
My nickname's MC Brutus
Cause I'm quick to pick up the mic and say, ""Yo, let's do this""
The world of hip-hop is so demandin
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so
(So fresh)
You're too smart to bite a part two
But if you ever get the nerve or heart to
When I find our behind, forget it
If it's a battle you want, I'm with it
1-2-3-4, Marley Marl, a-hi-hit me
Since when a beat he made not fit me
It's a fact too that I attract to
These beats I'm about to get back to
Girls I scoop, parties that I hoop
And I doubt with your rhymes you can hang with me, troop
Even though I, am a pro I
Grab the mic now and then to show I
Have the skill to, plus the will to
Make the jams you can sit back and chill to
I think about the rhymes, then write em
The first chance that you get, you go bite em
The world of hip-hop is so demandin
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so
(So fresh)
In the, beginning of
Around the time when they thought about the spinning of
Records on two turntables
Before they started callin dookie ropes cables
Even today I, you know the way I
Come across with dope rhymes I say, I
First suggest them, then manifest them
Go to Marley's house and Warner Bros. presses em
We had a touch of, but not much of
The def beats that we now have a clutch of
Understand me, we don't plan, we
And might I say myself, goddamn we
Hate to make a jam that ain't slammin
We make the jams that you wanna keep jammin
The world of hip-hop is so demandin
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so
(So fresh)
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so

Rock Stuff,"Play it Again, Shan",1990,"(Well, the definition of 'rock stuff' is
Cocaine broke down into the form of a rock
Which is why we call this here cut 'Rock Stuff'
Well, everybody out there listen to this
Cause Shan and I have a lot to say)

'Just say no' and 'Don't do it' is the wrong approaches
Drugs can make respected folks live like roaches
Life is a scale, drugs can unbalance it
Captivate your mind and lessen your talents, it's
Controlled by corrupt politicians
Instead of fiends they call you spies cause you're always on a mission
Modern day kamikaze killer elite
Once cast out you remain in the street
This kid named Charlie used to be legit
But he died from some messed up 
Bad enough everything is so tough
He need to get up offa that (rock stuff)
(Get up offa that) (rock stuff)

Drugs is not butter, eggs is not brains
This is what you're seein, but you're thinkin cocaine
Talkin bout 'smooth criminal'
Think of what it does to a man subliminal
Forget about it - you're done tryin?
You fool, you're the egg fryin!
The cream that will rise starts from the seed
It really would help if you proofread
Shoulda never called it 'free', just plain old 'basin'
A high you never catch, so you keep on chasin
Some are not confined to a portable stem
No joke to you, but it's funny to them
That you imprisoned yourself in a breakable cell
Makin heavenly clouds with the flames from hell
Somethin's wrong, slow down, kid
Yo, you better not ever get ahead of me
You can believe what you read in the books
Like Hitler's whole Reich was coked out crooks
There's presidents, lawyers, executive mayors
At least it does benefit the tax payers
Let's play a game of blind man's bluff
Let's say 'jails, guns and handcuffs'
You're so stupid, you can see how smooth I blend it
Your locked up and chained slave days have ended
""C.O., I wanna see my kids"" - that's tough
You shouldn't have been sellin that (rock stuff)

Gettin high is not an art, it isn't conventional
All the money that they're gettin and it isn't intentional
Here's some nursery rhymes that me and my son kick
So when he grows up he'll be wise to the trick
Little Miss Muffet who sat on her tuffet
All she did was beam all day
She went to reach for the lighter
With the smoke still inside her
She's been dead one week today
Mary sold all her little lambs
For this dust that looked like snow
Now Mary oughta quit
Cause she gotta have a hit
It woulda helped if she just said no
Now Jack and Jill went up the hill
To cop this half a quarter
Came back, put it down
And surprisingly found
That the sniffers had a crackhead daughter
Now remember Miss Lucy's baby?
He's now called Basehead Tim
Cause all he ever thought of
Was when could he hit the stem
He always asked people who's got em
And used his teeth to crack the top
But everybody cried when little Tim died
But he beamed till the day he dropped
These are all fatal accidents, unfortunate mishaps
Livin in bottles with assorted colored twist caps
Listen my man, it's about to get rough
You should get up offa that (rock stuff)",https://genius.com/Mc-shan-rock-stuff-lyrics
Walking On Sunshine,"Play it Again, Shan",1990,"I design rhymes usin architecture
And if I dislike ya, I'ma disrespect ya
The beats are pumpin, the lyrics you savour
And all you can do for me is a favor
Your body and soul will make the final departure
This mic is bein held in the hands of an archer
To ladies I'm sensual, they tell me I'm the greatest
I'm not a fronter, believe me when I say this
Look at me as bein the line
Between here and walkin on sunshine
(Sunshine)

I'm not even tryin to hear that the Juice went bad
What's wrong, muthafucka? You must be mad
Don't impose, I freeze ya like freon
And I don't know what kinda new shit you be on
I see you enhance with the spells I conjure
They're timid to the minute, you exceed beyond your
Limit, don't want you playin mine close
String you out and leave you hangin like a sign post
As long as I live I'll never beg to be down
Kickin on the solo tip and still can knock a tree down
Combined suckers diss and what you get after
Only use English combined with the math-
Matics, destroy rappers, strip em of their articles
Wax their little hineys till they're tinier than particles
Look at me as bein the line
Between here and walkin on sunshine
(Sunshine)

You had a notion that I couldn't remain
Instead of hip-hop joints I'd be singin in the rain
There's nothin wrong with some rain to refresh ya
In spite of it all in Buddah's name I bless ya
These regiment rhymes I practise
My wise words of wisdom are sharp like cactus
There's no mountain high, nor a valley low
And nothin ain't movin till I say so
You say you're sick and tired, you say you're fed up
What you're gonna do? Nothin, shut up
Takin you out, let me rewind it
This is how I broke it down and defined it
Look at me as bein the line
Between here and walkin on sunshine

How I Feel About You,"Play it Again, Shan",1990.0,"How I feel about you....
First verse 1: (MC Shan)
All words but you can see my action are louder, there are times when I don't know if I'm in or I'm out of your mind, but do you feel the same for me? Is this what the whole thing has came to be?
Sometimes I feel like a space you're caught in between or I might not be the person that you thought you seen
See it's something about the truth I learned to accept it.  I tried to hide my heart but you found where I kept it
The heart sees thing the eyes don't catch. Pitch my heart like a bone then you tell me to fetch
It gets to the point and how you love to show that so you think you know it all nah, but i know that
Plenty of time you threaten i'm going. That's right i'm making like the wind and I'm blowing
You just my sweetheart and I don't doubt you but first let me tell you
Chorus
How I feel about You...How I feel about You...how I feel about you... How I feel about youuuuuu
Second verse(MC SHAN)
Let me tell you're my heart we go arm in arm, and I always said you had that old persuasive charm
And when we kiss forget firecrackers try a grenade, when it comes to loving me babe you mastered the trade
What boggles me most is why you're so suspicious of me. And all the time you tell me that you love me
You know the lines the famous ones that left many strung out just like nameless sons
But every time say it, it gets twisted and dented, but one things' for sure I know that I meant it
And when I come home I get ""where you been what you been doing? And don't let me find out you been screwing.""
Goddamn I was chilling with the fellas and your nosy girl says ""yeah sure you was tell us""
Once again you said i'm leaving i'm going that's right I'm making like the wind and I'm blowing
You just might sweetheart and I don't doubt you, but first let me tell you
Chorus
How I feel about you...how I feel about you...how I feel about youuuu...how I feel about you...How I feel about You...How I feel about You...How, how,how..how, how, how, how
Third verse(MC SHAN)
Come to think about it you being tired of me you try to denounce everything that I try to be
Let's refocus, fix the frame and by the way to think about it I'm glad you came
Bust the pimple it's at it's head and how I feel about you there's more to be said
That time when I was rushing late for the flight, so you thought that was jetting and I was out of there right?
I came close but luckily I missed it, waved my hands in the air and bye-bye I kissed it
So I returned just to surprise ya, but I was stunned I didn't realize ya had this look and I was it. I was supposed to be gone yet there was candles lit,but you being oh so smart and so witty said ""aah you missed your flight isn't that a tough titty.""
It's like you knew you had the dinner fixed, putting two and two together just didn't mix
You got me comfy relaxed and fed me on and on and on and on you led me
Anything I asked you just kept nodding and out of nowhere you asked ""Would I beg your pardon?""
And then suddenly the phone had clicked and something said yo you better go and answer it quick
I heard ""i got to get off yeah i gotta to,"" ""I'm coming over"" you was smart for telling him not to
I played it off like it was copacetic you played me good girl, i got to give you credit
You're free to leave now go ahead go and this is how I feel about you...HOE!

Feed The World,UnKnown,1985.0,"We have to solve this problem, it's all out of hand
Feedin' starvin' children all across the land
It's a luxury to us, to eat what we may
But they might just get a meal one time a day
We need the help from every man, woman, boy and girl
Stop the starvation and feed the world

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world

None of this is fiction, this is actual fact
They can't eat or afford to put clothes on their back
That's why we're out on this here mission
To try to stop the famine and the malnutrition
All you really have to do is put in your share
 contributions by you and 
So a lot of these little young children can live
It's the thought that counts, not how much you give

We gotta feed the world
We gotta feed the world
We gotta feed the world

In situations like this you must examine
How it got so bad that it led to famine
In the summer it's hot, they don't wear hats
They be makin' shish kebabs out of dogs and cats
They'll be thankful that they get it and they won't ask how
The snack you have between your meals they would call that chow

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world

You come and go to the store any time you please
Like caviar to us, to them it's turkey and cheese
Won't you show you have compassion and give them a start?
And show them you have goodness deep inside of your heart
You say you can't afford it won't you give me a brake
They never heard of Mickey D's let alone a steak
Hawk your diamond ring or maybe a pearl
Make the sacrifice just to feed the world

We gotta feed the world
We gotta feed the world
We gotta feed the world

I don't see what's the problem, let's all face facts
Every dime you donate comes back in tax
You have to see to it when it's time to file
What's a small wait compared to helpin' a child?
If you ask my opinion I don't see nothin' wrong
Sendin' in a small donation's more than singing the song

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world

All they ever eat is soup made from wheat and barley
They would go crazy over Beefsteak Charlie's
How can you watch TV and not even care?
Sit back at laugh at all and you're a millionaire
If you can't part with a dollar you're dealin' with lust
They can't do it all alone, they need help from us
I know it's all about money and buildin' your wealth
Stop being so stingy and thinking of self

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world

Instead of going downtown and makin' a deposit
On something that looks good in your closet
Think of someone else and be evenly fair
Instead of buying something that you know that you won't wear
They need help from everybody so someday they'll be grown
Won't you all pitch in a hand 'cause I can't do it alone?

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world

They'll be glad to say thanks without hesitation
Be courteous enough to show appreciation
It will bring out some emotion that you just can't hide
If you don't show it face you'll  feel it inside
It's not much more I can say, I'm feeling fine
Because I got it off my chest and it's out of my mind
You should have got my message if you think that you're smart
Well head in this one direction 'cause we're climbing the chart
