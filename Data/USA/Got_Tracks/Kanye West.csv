Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious

Monster,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,"I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, Mami; best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present—kiss my ass

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (Decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide

I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with '
Chance 3

I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt

Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""

Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys,
 
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves

Blood on the Leaves,Yeezus,2013.0,"Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

To all my second-string bitches, tryin' get a baby
Tryin' get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to JAY-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah
'Til death, but do your part, uh
Unholy matrimony

That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (Breathe)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn

Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless

I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything

How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)

Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it

Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him

From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""

Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

Please, no more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm

Far as girls, you got a flock

My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez,
 
four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid

His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk

You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl

I will die for those I love

To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul

The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, ""Don't text me, ho""
Told you four times, ""Don't test me, ho""
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh Indian
'Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho

These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
""Baby girl, he's a loner""
""Baby girl, he's a loner""
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
""When it's over it's over""
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

I heard you need a new fad (A new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (A new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (A new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (A new girl)

Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-hold-my-liquor-lyrics

Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a God
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a God
I am a God
I am a God

Ahh!
Ahh!

I just talked to Jesus
He said, ""What up, Yeezus?""
I said, ""Shit—I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions""

Gorgeous,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,"Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it; Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a 
South Park
 writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it,
 
do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever; who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Ayo
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch,
 back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

Not for nothing I've forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-gorgeous-lyrics

Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?

But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low

Don't make me pull the toys

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Blame Game,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,"Whose fault?

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

On a bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights
,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

""Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely""

Let's play the blame game, I love you more

Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron

Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme"", not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word—haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?


Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone

Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Ugh!)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Ugh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over

Back in the lab and shit

My wife said, ""I can't say no to nobody""
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived

Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi

A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets your salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo

Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last

Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce

Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

So Appalled,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,"One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil, so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yuugh!

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care

It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, you know this shit is fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair.""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve

Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this.""

We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that

Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(
Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-thought-about-killing-you-lyrics
Violent Crimes,ye,2018.0,"Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't 
Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

I'm saying it like...
""I want a daughter like Nicki, aw, man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no ménages""

Chi city! Chi city!

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around

Through the Wire,I’m Good,2003.0,"Last October Grammy nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-through-the-wire-lyrics

Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

And I sometimes wish
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run through with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, ooh

And I know you wouldn't...

Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time somethin' happen they want me sent to mental
We had an incident, but I cover incidentals
You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here

I use the same attitude that done got us here

I live for now, I don't know what happen after here

One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

Butterfly in my wrist
You make pretty women out of my skin (Out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (Uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (Love me or hate me)

For any guy that ever fucked up (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (Ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty

For every down female that stuck with they dude

Aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested

Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""

So get your ass up off the wall

So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
So won't you raise your glass won't you
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, ""Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap""
No ID: ""Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap""

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that ""Truth"" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, ""Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off ""Xxplosive"" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on ""This Can't Be Life.""
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, ""Oh you a real soulful dude.""

And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

""Tell me what you think of this."" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, ""What you think of it?""

And I was like, ""Man that shit tight,"" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, ""Heart of the City."" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did ""Nothing Like It"" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, ""Yo play that one beat for him."" And I played ""Heart of the City."" And really I made ""Heart of the City,"" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, ""Yo what's up I'm Kanye.""

""You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats""

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like ""oh shit."" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, ""yo Jay I could rap."" And I spit this rap that said, uh ""I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips."" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, ""Man that was tight.""

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, ""H to the Izzo,"" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. ""Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z."" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, ""yo but I rap too."" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, ""Naw."" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

Dame was like, ""Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.""

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
""I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.""
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like ""oh shit""

""I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.""

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like ""yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick""

""You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on."" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, ""oh, word?"" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, ""oh he's just a producer-rapper,"" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, ""yo... Capitol pulled on the deal""

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, ""man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?""
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...
So won't you raise your glass, won't you...",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-last-call-lyrics

Selah,JESUS IS KING,2019.0,"God is King, we the soldiers

When I scream at the chauffeur
I ain't mean, I’m just focused
I ain't mean, I'm just focused
Pour the lean out slower
Got us clean out of soda

They did the same thing to Noah
Everybody wanted Yandhi
Then Jesus Christ did the laundry
They say the week start on Monday
But the strong start on Sunday

Even when we die, we raise up (Hallelujah)
Ain't no wantin', no, we need it

We need ours by this evening
No white flag or no treaty
We got the product, we got the tools
We got the minds, we got the youth
We goin' wild, we on the loose
People is lying, we are the truth
Everything old shall now become new
The leaves’ll be green, bearing the fruit

Your loss!

Rockstar, bitch, call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killin', while I'm drillin'
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night, my bitches came in twos
And they both sucked like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
'Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be goin' hard, I got a name to prove
Killin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

This the cray-ist shit in the club
Since ""In Da Club""
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say ""Can you get my friends in the club?""
I say ""Can you get my Benz in the club?""
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again

We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down
We can send this bitch up, it can go down

'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance,
 
I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

I gotta testify

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat,
 
en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

I gotta testify

Never Let Me Down,The College Dropout (OG Version),2004.0,"When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up

I get down for my grandfather
 
who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism's still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us ""us free"" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self-down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

Who else you know been hot this long?
(
Oh yeah, we ain't finished
)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble
, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
 
(Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan them
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
They way y'all all follow Jigga

Big Brother,Graduation,2007.0,"Stadium status

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Hell of a Life,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,"I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin’ life like we won the sweepstakes, what
We headed to hell for Heaven’s sakes, huh
Well I’ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin’ from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It’s kinda crazy that’s all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves
 
all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

One day I’m gon' marry a porn star
We’ll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We’ll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin’ to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I’mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin’ to on Oscar day
'specially if she can’t get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn’t rent her, they couldn’t take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, “Get away”
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on
Fuck with the lights
Fuck with the- with the lights on

Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night

My light in darkness, oh
God, God is
He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)

Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
Worship Christ with the best of your portions
I know I won't forget all He's done
He's the strength in this race that I run
Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
And it shows just how much He is miraculous
I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
I know God is alive, yeah
He has opened up my vision
Giving me a revelation
This ain't 'bout a dead religion
Jesus brought a revolution
All the captives are forgiven
Time to break down all the prisons
Every man, every woman
There is freedom from addiction
Jesus, You have my soul
Sunday Service on a roll
All my idols, let 'em go
All the demons, let 'em know
This a mission, not a show
This is my eternal soul
This my kids, this the crib
This my wife, this my life
This my God-given right

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

Close your eyes and imagine,
 feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
 seen through 
Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school

I just want you to be proud of me

Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

Ye vs. the People (starring TI as the People),UnKnown,2018.0,"Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit…
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, ""Fuck it, I'ma do me.""
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-ye-vs-the-people-starring-ti-as-the-people-lyrics

So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Did you realize

You don't see just how wild the crowd is
You don't see just how fly my style is
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say ""when you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
Cause every summer, he'd get some
Brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school with a new wardrobe

They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I cleaned up my act like Prince'd do
If not for pleasure, then at least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

Tell me what it takes to be number one

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes I did
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin', show you how we live
Everybody want it, but it ain't that serious
Mhm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this... like this

Everything I Am,Graduation,2007.0,"Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I'll never be picture-perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B 
or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet? He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, 
or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the N-nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award

Damn, here we go again
Bum-tu-bum-bum-bum
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please, no more today

Damn, here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again

Spaceship,The College Dropout,2004.0,"I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit (Yeah, yeah)
I wish I could (Me too)
Buy me a spaceship and fly (Swear I do)
Past the sky, oh
GLC feel you, baby—I feel you, man
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky (Man, man, man...)
Oh, oh, oh

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Tryna tell you, man, way past the sky
Oh, oh (Let's go, ugh)

And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob at the same time (Woo)
Thirsty on the grind, Chi state of mind
Lost my mama, lost my mind (Aww)
Life, my love, that's not mine
""Why you ain't signed?"" Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only wanna ball, never wanna fall (Ugh)
Gotta get mine, gotta take mine (Ugh)
Got a Tec-9, reach my prime (Ugh)
Gotta make these haters respect mine (Yeah)
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule had said 9
Putting them pants on shelves
Waiting patiently; I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than running in the streets
Holler at 'Ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet, sounds so sweet
Yes, I'm the same ol' G
Same goatee, stayin' low-key, nope
Holler at God: ""Man, why'd you have to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddie G., Yusef G, love my G
Rolly G, police watch me
Smoke my weed and count my Gs
Got a lot of people counting on me (That's right)
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace (That's right)
Should've finished school like my niece
Then I finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow!

I've been working this grave-shift
Aww, man, this pressure
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky
Oh, oh, oh

I 'member having to take the dollar cab
Coming home real late at night
Standing on my feet all damn day
Tryna make this thing right
And havin' one of my coworkers say, ""Yo, you look just like
This kid I seen in an old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well, easy come, easy go, how that saying goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
That all had got snatched from me, A&Rs and they faculties
All turn their back on me and didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally, actually, had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe, empty fridge is staring back at me
'Cause nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off, bow!

I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky, oh
I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit
I wish I could
Buy me a spaceship and fly
Past the sky

Gone,Late Registration,2005.0,"Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh!)
But it's too late, it's too late he's gone

You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way

, it's too late

Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like bitch it's yo turn
""Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""

Oh my chinchilla blue, blue

Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the
 Bimmer now

We striving home, I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented 
Gone With the Wind
, 'cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone

Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-gone-lyrics
We Don’t Care,The College Dropout (OG Version),2004.0,"Oh, yeah...
I got the perfect song for the kids to sing...
And all my people that's—

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say""

If this is your first time hearing this
You are about to experience something so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do something, man, your ass is grown

'Cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling makeup, Jacob's
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on lay-away, then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS,
 
some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chrome-y wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—

Low Lights,The Life of Pablo,2016.0,"You want me to give you a testimony about my life
And how good he's been to me
I don't know what to tell you about him
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul
With every bone in my body I love him so much
Because he's done so much for me
Every morning
Every day of my life
I won't always be crying tears
In the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up
By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do
And how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it
How I'm gonna get there, because he...
He's gonna be there for me
Some day the sky above will open up
And he will reach out  his hand and guide me through
Oh yes he will
I won't always be crying these tears
I won't always be feeling so blue
Some day, he will open up the door for me
And call my name
Some day he will
I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like
No matter what you've been through
Or where you've been he's always there
With his arms open wide
Accepting me
For who I am
And I love him so much
I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to
I'm crying now
It feels so good to be free
To be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what
Oh lord thank you
You are the joy of my life",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-low-lights-lyrics

And all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me)
Ma we here we gon' cook this Sunday ok?
That's a new girlfriend?

This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet like a photo
Of your granny's picture, now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah, you heard the track I did man, ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

And I don't care 'bout
(all the diamond rings all the diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all is my weight and gold

Abi, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV!""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And they gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit 3 in the bed if it's 6 of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family, dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family, dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me, dog
You can still love your man and be manly, dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storm out then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh

They don't mean a thing a thing a thing

You choose, you choose

I've been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

I'm tryna to catch the beat

Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands

And if you're losin' your high then smoke again
(Keep 'em high)

N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcohol-ics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'Til I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her ""Why don't you kill me?""
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna fol-low my heart
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't, usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'

(""You've got mail!"") N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailing me at 11:26?
Telling me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on Black Planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas
Right now she just lampin', chillin' on campus
Sent me a picture with her feelin' on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami
Your screen saver say tweet, so you got to ""call me""
And bring a friend for my friend, his name Kweli
(You mean Talib? Lyrics sticks to your rib)
I mean (That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean (You don't really know him, why is you lyin'?)
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin', just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time
And get her high! Owww!

Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin' up dimes
But never-mind, I need some tracks, you tryin' to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow, you trying to blow backs out
Well okay, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm
Ayo, ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your moms?
And sister's the bomb, boy she got the bougie behavior
Always got something to say like a okay playa hater
Anyways, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks with birth control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin' that much or tryna get off cigarettes? (Keep 'em high)
If she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
Now I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubba kush and a sister could get a hit of it, yeah

Yo, yo
Get 'em high like noon or the moon
Or a room filled with smoke, a hype-filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune
But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remote
Control rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show, called Soul Survivor
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper
Just a emcee with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, emcees retirin'
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

N-now, th-th-throw your motherfuckin' hands
(Get 'em high, yeah)
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfuckin' man
(Get 'em high, mm-mm, uh-uh)
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
(Keep 'em high, keep 'em high, keep 'em high, uh-uh)
And if you're losin' your high then smoke again

Drive Slow,Late Registration,2005.0,"Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin' now I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

Drive slow, homie
Drive slow
You never know, homie, about these hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawling? You see them screens falling?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' something candy-coated, crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jamming on that Screw
I'm looking for them hoes, baby, what it do? Drive slow, homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow, homie
If you're riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow, homie
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TVs in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby, I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking, and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smoking on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie, drive slow
(drive slow, drive slow)

Yeah
Drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie
You never know, homie, might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
Drive slow, homie",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-drive-slow-lyrics

Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her

I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! 
Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme

It's a round table full of bosses here
Still givin' you it all like the coffin's near

It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave ya
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me

Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin' now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin',

Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living

Get Right for the Summer
 workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(AH!) What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

Oh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
, 
Twista said ""Get It Wet""
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit girl, I'll still hit girl
1 and, you brought 2 friends, ok, 3 more now hop in the Benz
4-door: do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8?
All the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

White Dress,The Man With the Iron Fists (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes?
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up

Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh

We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems, baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass?
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying, baby, you have changed
'Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
'Cause even when we're kissing, baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, ""No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?""
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, ""How is work, baby?""
Well, some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe, I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, ""'Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends""
On the phone, hollin' that ""Niggas is whatever""
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, ""Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress""
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no, that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, ""Just drive so far""
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well, we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb 'cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herbs, go somewhere in private
I'm talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot, uh

Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you, girl
Wooooaah ohhh",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-white-dress-lyrics

Wonder if they're gonna read your rights
Thirteenth Amendment, three strikes
Made a left when I should've made a right
Told God last time on life
Told the devil that I'm going on a strike

Change, he ain't really different
He ain't even try to get permission
Ask for advice and they dissed him
Said I'm finna do a gospel album
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
They'll be the first one to judge me
Feelin' like nobody love me
Told people God was my mission
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it feel like nobody love me
Make you feel alone in the dark and you'll never see the light
Man, you're never seein' home and you never see the domes
I can feel it when I write, point of livin' in the right
If they only see the wrongs, never listen to the songs
Just to listen is a fight, but you booked me for the fight
It's so hard to get along if they only see the slight
From the love of religion
What have you been hearin' from the Christians?
They'll be the first one to judge me
Make it seem like nobody love me
I'm not tryna lead you to Visas

Tank on empty, whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss

Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends
Yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like?
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to B.I.G

I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
""He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you""
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said ""Hello""
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said ""Hell no""
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?

My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want

No women in the crowd, screamin' and it’s loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it’s going down right now

I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now

Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I’m in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I’ma make it hot 'til it’s time to go
When it’s time to go, where you tryna go?

Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
""Be successful,"" that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O, now I OD

Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like, 'Ye protégé?
He sound like he a pro to me
""I know Kanye a jerk,"" how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls
We be gettin' paid like W-2
Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
""We love you Sean,"" I love you too
Ooh-ooh, you know I do

Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
I know Jet magazine calling right now
You looking good today too, I like that
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on

Not looking for trouble
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks
Yes!
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

All I see is black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil’s angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my Shyne into Moses
Couldn’t cleanse my soul with them Civil Rights hoses
Panoramic roof, under glass like a coaster
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Killian loafers, Mikimoto chokes her
Photo-op is priceless, frame our wanted posters
The audacity, war brings casualty
Bitch, have my son before I face that tragedy
Ugh, I order hits, she orders mahi
R.I.P. Vivian Blake, shout out the Shower Posse, gone!

Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks
Yeah, yeah
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

I miss the misogyny, bad bitches massagin' me
Sometimes, we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please don’t judge me, ugh, for the following:
Fat bitches swallowing, skinny bitches modeling
Take off that Givenchy and let’s get raunchy
I'll have your face looking all Captain Crunch-y
The devil stay testing
'Cause when you chase the pussy, it’s a sin
But if it falls in your lap, it’s a blessig'
Soon as I got salad, I spent it all on dressing
French, to be exact, that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers...

CyHi!
Yeah!

Boy, we lookin’ for trouble
Maybe if we wasn’t Black, then we wouldn’t have struggled
Player, all I got is trap niggas and crooks in my huddle
They cook and I smuggle, got 20 pounds of kush in the duffle
So I’m running through them circles, boy, I’m lookin like Knuckles
Look at my knuckles, got the hook in, ’cause niggas was looking
I’ve tooken some whoopings, so trust me, dog, I’m good for a scuffle
Don’t be mad I whooped your ass 'cause I’ve tooken a couple
Feds asking niggas questions, but I wouldn’t rebuttal
'Cause I’m Jake Gyllenhaal, I’m in the hood with the bubble
With a tall model broad like I took her from Russell
Didn’t play the cards I was dealt, I made the dealer re-shuffle
Huh, royal flush, so kiss my royal nuts
Ain’t nothing silver-spooned, I came from the soil, bruh
But now, I’m eatin’ off of Raffaello Gold
Exquisite ravioli with some happy yellow hoes
But don’t get it confused when I rap these mellow flows
'Cause all my Titos got bricks like the yellow road

G.O.O.D.! I do it

B-I-G, Sean Don, nigga
Looking for trouble, trouble, trouble
But you found it, motherfucker
Some shekels fe I shenks
Bitch! I'm in...
Just a burn up de lamb’s bread

... That no-smoke sec', rolling motherfucking ounces
Marijuana mountains, drinks you’re not pronouncing
Three chains on, I don’t need no bouncers
Nothing less than a G stashed in my trousers (Boy)
New double Ds smashed in her blouses
Fuck a hotel, my nigga we rent houses (Houses)
My nigga, we rent houses
So many wedding rings lost in them couches
I’m just a Westside lover
I leave females in my sheets and all my feelings in a rubber
This is showtime, showtime, boy, I hope you set the DVR
Stacking money face to face, this shit look like CPR
‘Ye invited me a seat to sit at the throne
So now I’m snappin’ like yo ass just finished the poem
Does he sound like 'Ye, Jay or Drizzy Drake? (Drizzy Drake)
Meanwhile I’m chillin’ with all these niggas, counting all this money you ain’t
Consider yourself lucky to see a legend before the prime
A killer before the crime, a B.I.G. before the dying
Greet me with a middle finger when you see me
It’s cool 'cause I can’t see yo ass from this side of the TV, motherfucker!

Hey, Cole World, make way for the chosen one
What you now hear is puttin’ fear in all the older ones
Downplayed me to downgrade me like they don’t notice him
Your shoes too big to fill? I can barely squeeze my toes in ‘em
Fucking hoes while teachin' niggas to hold your sons
This the rap Moses—scratch that, Mary and Joseph’s son
High as fuck with a cold flow and a loaded gun
Never say I’m better than Hov, but I’m the closest one
Heard you lookin’ for trouble, what, I’m 'sposed to run?
Your bitch invited me inside her, ain’t I 'sposed to come?
Got niggas that’ll blow your tee off, put a hole in one
Now you outside of Heaven’s gate, frontin’ like you know someone
Talking hard, but y’all still ain’t push me
They say you are what you eat, and I still ain’t pussy
Hmm, fuck it, everybody can get it
When you’re this hot, everybody’s a critic
But when you’re this high, everybody’s a midget
All this mean-mugging from niggas that mean nothing
Could it be my position is one that you dreamed of?
Went from quarter to broke to half-past-rich
With my badass bitch
And you don’t want no problems, on some math class shit
So check the young genius out
Fuck the world, bust a nut, and let my semen sprout
I thought that real shit is what you been fiending ’bout
What you been praying for? What you been screaming ’bout?
Ironic, you been sleeping on the one that you been dreaming 'bout",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-looking-for-trouble-lyrics
Who Will Survive in America,My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,2010.0,"Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom; free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
""All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night""
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you

I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time

See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'mma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man

God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be""
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

There is no vacation spot I could fly

Do you really have the stamina?

For everybody that sees you to say, ""Sign a autograph""
For everybody that sees you cryin that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh

No one, right beside me
The only one, was behind me

I can't...
The only one that come out on the tour and stays
Back when I was livin' at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be get got
And the day I moved to L.A., maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy, chasin' the American dream
Chasin' everything we seen, up on the TV screen
And when uh, the Benz was left
And the clothes was left, and the hoes was left

We won't stop, everybody move

Now throw ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
(Throw your hands up high) Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go
And keep ya hands up, hustlers, busters, boosters
Hoes ('Til they reach the sky), everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

Two words: Chi-Town, Southside, worldwide
'Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint, five mics
Go-Getters rhyme, like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words: Chi-Town raised me, crazy
So I live by two words: ""Fuck you, pay me""
Screaming, ""Jesus, save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God, it's the same me
And I basically know now, we get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus, I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom, so the top's the only place to go now

Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
(Throw your hands up high)
Oh, everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Still nowhere to go

Two words, Freeway, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words: fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through your car, my God
Two words: no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
Free, young boss, freshman of the Roc
With the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs to brawl
Forget your squad, better fend for yourself
Have you screamin' out four words: ""Send for the law,"" ugh
Two words: Freeway, slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in your artist, leave with his broad

Red, white, blue, black (Throw your hands up)
Calm down, move back
Motherfuckers askin' ""who is that?""
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Ghetto people get this shit off ya chest
North to the south, to the east, to the west
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest

When I pull the piece out niggas like ""Peace out!""

Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon, more chips than Pentium
""What'cha gon' buy next?"" Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks, and I'm so broke
I look back like ""Damn, was I on crack?""
I mean, twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?

And dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale that's usin' a toothpick
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for a $free.99
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm den-a-muhh, she asked
""Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was?""
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby, I fully understand, let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give me some head, that'll really piss him off

I blow past low-class niggas with no cash
In the four dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
""K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it
Sell it, the fiends cop it, nowadays they can't tell if

Buying a new bag, first one to get

You just keep singing, I'mma tell 'em
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down
(Oh when it all)

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

Oh when it all, it all falls down

Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this!""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down

I say fuck the police, that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gonna act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it

Oh when it all, it all falls down
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
Oh when it all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Don't stop that shit, keep that shit
Keep that part where I ran out of breath
We ain't doing no punch-ins, man
That's that fake shit
If I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?
It's from the heart anyway
Might cause shortness of breath, ya know?

There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something

What you calling?
I let all in for getting what some get will get ya
What kind of dream we found?
See, I'm often catching crosswinds
Forgetting where the hell I met you
And try to bring me down

I always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, way down
One day, they'd tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Way down, they'd try to bring me down",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-bring-me-down-lyrics
Hurricane,Yandhi,2020.0,"Lyrics from leaked demo, not final

Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't have all the hood rats in Mud Rats
Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that’s how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi, this that Oprah feel

Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
80 degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

I Feel Like That,UnKnown,2015.0,"While you're fast asleep

Do you experience nervousness or shakiness inside, faintness and dizziness? 
The idea that someone else can control your thoughts.
 
Feeling others are to blame for most of your thoughts.
 Trouble remembering things, feeling easily annoyed and irritated. 
Feeling afraid in open spaces or in public.
 
Thoughts of ending your life.
 
Feeling that most people could not be trusted.
 Poor appetite, heart or chest pains?

I feel like this
I feel like this
I feel like that
I feel like this all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

Do you feel tempered outbursts, that you cannot control?
 Feeling lonely, even when you are with people, feeling blocked. Feeling blue, sad, feeling disinterested in things, feeling fearful. 
Are your feelings easily hurt?
 
Feeling that people are unfriendly, or do you feel like people dislike you?

I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time
I feel like that
I feel like that all the time

Do you have trouble falling asleep?
 Nausea, upset stomach, hot or cold spells? Numbness, tingling in parts of your body, trouble catchin' your breath?

So I'll just say good night, to you

I'm just gon' say good night

Uh
Good night
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday, like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man, I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh
Man (man), I wouldn't let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin'?
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life (real life), if you try to
So close (so close), but so far (but so far)
And so far (and so far), no cigar (no cigar)
We can't dwell on the past, all we got is today

So I'll just say good night, to you

My only question is, ""Where my presents?""
She said, ""Shhh,"" she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami

DONDA (2012),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I appreciate everyone’s support for my clothing line but I wanted to clarify a few things… The name of the line is Kanye West not DW… The DW was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom :-). I really appreciate the fake DW twitter page but since it’s not official I can’t co-sign any information on it
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” – Leonardo Da Vinci
More clarity… I have no agency representing me currently… William Morris was fired after Cara Lewis quit. I love Cara Lewis :-)
I love being back at my fashion office learning and creating. It’s so challenging and fun and I’m surrounded by amazing people. They say you only live once but every time I come to work I feel like I’m starting a second life. You guys might think I have some type of backing for my line but I don’t. I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I’ve been working at this for 8 years now. From the first offers to do urban clothing lines that I turned down…to begging Bape to do my line and never making any real headway…to having an office in LA that was shut down after the “MTV” moment along with my tour with (Lady) Gaga
I moved to Japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room. I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men’s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti’s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity
I designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I’m “allowed” to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas…
Early 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don’t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don’t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn’t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-). This was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small Paris studio in a courtyard opposite Collate
I remember being 5 years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots. She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women’s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don’t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished “Cosby Show” sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn’t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike’s in 4th grade
Being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, “you should do a Jetsons tour!”
This just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that’s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas
I appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy’s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me “smile Kanye”, the world likes you again. “Red or blue pill?”…aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn’t have the prestige I have if it wasn’t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that
Hmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again… Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim…the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it’s better to read than trained thoughts
What good is fame and prestige if you can’t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best…create
I have started a new company and I’m so excited about the name…it’s got the best name ever…of all companies…of all time!!!
The name of the company is DONDA
DONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers
DONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs…DONDA
This will all take time but I wanted everyone’s to know what I really care about…I care about people…I care about my fans…I care about people who have never heard of me…There are over 7 billion people on the planet now…It’s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke
The Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be…
I’m currently working on a new 7 screen experience…
This is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics…It’s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)
We would also like to design the MTV awards. We’re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board…don’t just sit there…reach out
We can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off
When I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life
Spike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!
UNLESS YOU’RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones…why not promote it?
Allow kids to use search engines to do test…like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect…please excuse my grammar…I know it’s extremely ironic
Some kids have better memories than others…what about emotional IQ’s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?
Excuse me…I just get excited at the possibilities…the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you’ll see…
We need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better
When me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us
The adrenaline is running…I don’t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders…I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven’t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years
I invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices…etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products…my strength is connectivity…
There are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems…we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments
I just wanted to share what’s been on my mind…
“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple…but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” – George Bernard Shaw",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-donda-2012-annotated

Backing drums by DJ Premier
Now let me count it down, who the fuck up in here

That niggas know you can’t really fuck with that
Pusha T, the Clipse just made a classic
Good music together we too Jurassic, you stay plastic
Ramadan with the flow, guaranteed everyone fasting
Big Sean is a don
Cyhi Da Prynce
Why you so nervous dog stop being tense
If you ain't talking bout Rash we ain't got nothing in common
Fuck that and thats just common sense

Came in the game, 8 years prior
8 years later, your mans on fire
My Book of Eli, to all my subscribers
Play the two doors, street car named desire
Came in Grindin’, Ye’ came Through the Wire
Met at the crossroads, Bone thugs inspired
1st of the month, Trump to the buyers
Red Toupée on the coupe you've been fired
Smooth criminal, no prior’s
Man in the mirror, check no liar
Still let that ""butter fly"" like Mariah
Show me the money the black Jerry MaGuire
Tom Cruise on that couch if that money right
West Hollywood feels like a bunny night
With GOOD company and better jewelers
To the Good Life, we GOOD music

Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day’s a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I’m pressed clean
Detroit’s Angel, I even got red wings
I’m headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life’s prom night and guess who’s the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I’m Don King
Everybody know I’m coming soon like LeBron’s ring
I’m Big L, Notorious, Big Pun, Shawn Carter
Sean Combs and Connery all in one
Whoever told you sky’s the limit is looking dumb
Cause I’m 22 and I’m moonwalking on the sun
Oh thats your girl?
She feelin on my ""whoa there!"", right next to a couple boaters
And she tryna motor boat her
And im coming from the w-w-westside of the Motor
You might find banana clips ’cause it’s Guerilla warfare
Last year I was watching this from the couch
And now I’m here
That should let you know what I’m about
Reaper black suit cuz my whole team’s killing
Had to keep setting trends cuz your whole team stealin
Many tell me I’m the man I ain't made it yet
Tell me who the baddest, I’ll see if I seen them naked yet
Won’t stop til I get that Mercedes 700 CLK and Mercedes ain't made it yet

I’m Mr Got bread like Quizno’s
Better known as MJ with the big nose
I swear your artist couldn’t see me on his tip toes
Only on TV I gotta take a quick pose
Let me stop I forgot this was a big show
And being dope made you broke I am piss poor
I’m big poppa plus I’m 2pacalypto
My mind is a weapon what I need to pop a clip for
Huh, I’m doing this for hip hop
Im coming after you, him and his spot
Still tied to the streets like a hitch knot
Ain't nothing fake, I’m not a Rolly with a tick tock
Atlanta repper in the home of the Yankee
Rose wood suit on with the hanky
I got rich from the zones of the stanky
So everybody know my money long, lanky!
So I’m flexible stretching out my decimel’s
Switching up the flow got the crowd going testicles
Can’t bleep it out cuz there wasn’t nothing sexual
I’m blowing loud, somebody check the decibels
I’m impeccable they put me on the pedestal
And if you bite me, it’s good for you like a vegatable
Shows by the several, schedule full of festivals
And if I ever do time than you know its federal
Uh, incredible, yeah

F-f-fam fam fam I’ma monster too
You don’t see I do things that the monsters do
The incomparable, remarkable, articles
About my audio technique, my technique
I recognise games like the ESPY’s
Cold to myself I say God Bless me the truth
So I speak live and directly
You, I will set free my mic is where my check be
Rah, I echo, I echo, I echo, the sounds of the ghetto, future of the retro
Prolly in the metro just so I can get dough
The name is Common but the frame is special
Leave requested from the years I’ve invested
Arrested, develop, addressed it, envelope
The body of the black party from Farley to Bob Marley
Go home or go hard, at home is life hardly

The plan was to drink till the pain over
What’s worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air rolling down the window
Too many urkels on your team thats why your Winslow
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And I ain't finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Just a few things pouring out my soul

He think he live, he think he cold
He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across, ugh

I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather was unbearably hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, and forever we hot?

Selling kilos through your iPod Nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy—look at Marbury’s handle
Vaseline face,
 reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh! On 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in

He looked up at me
Said, ""Daddy, that's the reason why you had me?""
Yep, we was practicing
'Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal for my newborn child

They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game it's another name, for life fightin
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it -

""Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again

Eyes Closed,UnKnown,UnKnown,"And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil: that's a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me loneliness
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring?
It's feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out Dogg, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we ain’t finna change, so we’ll never agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed

And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground

I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys

I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk?

Adriana for Giselle
Let's exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious, gettin' anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say I’ve been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me, call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
I’ll be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like Ice-T
I’m not right dog, I’m slightly off
I’m paranoid; like bonin’ raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea, that’ll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you, I should’ve took nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off

Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds

The only star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small, furthermore

I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction, I'm sun, he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo

Intro,The College Dropout,2004.0,"Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin'
Could you do a lil' som...
Somethin' beautiful, somethin' that the kids are gon' love when they hear it
That's gon' make them start jumpin' up and down, and sharin' candy and stuff
Think you could probably do somethin', for the kids, for graduation to sing?",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-intro-lyrics
Chain Heavy,G.O.O.D. Fridays,2010.0,"Uh, we got the black elite in the house tonight
Rosewood
I feel like I'm at the NAACP or something right now
The Essence Festival
Q-Tip on the beat too, uh, uh

My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe 'cause it's flooded
Why you walk around with a baby cross's cousin?
My teeth already white, y'all gon' make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds, what's the cause of the frontin'?
Why y'all got all caps on?
Don Cheadle time, get extra black on 'em
Burn, Hollywood, burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the pyramids
I swear life's a bitch on her period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweller add a few more links
You can look at me, tell I ain't fuck what nobody think
And my face always lookin' like somebody stinks

My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

Question:
What color was the skin of the man who beared the cross?
No matter how many lashes, they couldn't beat it off
How many Cassius' will we see in one lifetime?
That's why it's Miles Davis, Kobe, it's Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered
In the 1800s; y'all forget that
I got called ""Nigga"" on Twitter so many times, yo, I lived that
Now I'm just tryna find where to raise my kids at
'Cause they don't want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey, realtor, I'm lookin' for a nice park
Twelve noon, she said my family gon' make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listenin' to, in this existence
Don't give up now, just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep 'em away, hanh! Something might happen
This is the makin' of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master, ""Peace!""

My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

Here we go, like we should

Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should

Some wear a suit and tie, they don't wanna remain average
Some wear a suit and tie like a chain and a straitjacket
My chain heavy, stop in that traffic, coppers harass us
Then DA attack us, want us in chains like B.A. Baracus
So no major factor in my decision to be a rapper
Was rebellion; being anti-establishment was attractive
To a black kid from Brooklyn, flames got the thangs cooking
Land of the juks where them lames get them chains tooken
It ain't lookin' good for you if you're a tourist here
Sometimes I rhymes the sort of frequency that only purists hear
A couple rappers tried to beef with me, nobody's scared
Niggas was so fucking corny that nobody cared
Why I gotta battle rappers? I debate scholars
Question: do it gotta make sense if it make dollars?
Sick visions is living inside of brains
It's like we sadomasochistic, addicted to whips and chains
Figuratively, quite literally, clinically insane
Spit flames and then visit the higher plane
Try in vain to ignore it, don't buy the chain if you can't afford it
'Ye, them lonely-idled whores by the boards, trust

That old ball-and-chain had me chained up for weeks
So of course I'm off the chain as soon as I hit the streets
And now when we link she saying the game's over
I drove her crazy and she became a chain smoker
Now the new dude she's saying that can stay over
Should be a chain, who goes by the name of Choker
That's what he did when she told him he should play the sofa
So the chains on the door, I'm on the way over
Now when I came over, his only response
Was, ""You must be the owner of a chain of restaurants
'Cause I'mma eat your food for that chain that I wore
'Cause you be running 'round like the chain make the man""
So it's obvious the he don't know the chain of command
'Cause my chain commands, that kind of respect
And it's so chunky that it's a pain in the neck
But it came with a check, I remember on chaining day
It spoke for itself and this is what the chain would say
""Them chain snatchers are hoping that you ain't ready
So don't get distracted, keep your aim steady
Or there'll be a chain reaction since my chain's heavy""

My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy
My chain heavy, yeah, yeah, my chain heavy
My chain heavy, my chain too heavy

Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Here we go, like we should
Feel the sweat, on your face
Alright, okay
Here we go, like we should
Like we should, like we should
Like we should",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-chain-heavy-lyrics

I heard the Chinese buyin' Africa quicker than we would get it
And if you tell somebody you goin' to Africa
Somebody would laugh at ya

Don’t Look Down,G.O.O.D. Fridays,2010.0,"Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, ""Trust me""
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, ""You won't leave me if you love me""
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, ""The end, question mark""

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Hook: Kanye West & 
Big Sean

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?

Okay now baby here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean ""me go?"" Why can't it be ""we go""?
What happens when people turn to tears? (huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
(Do it!) How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying ""The world did this to me""
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your ""Seans, you know I love you""
Shedding tears everyday (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask ""Why?"" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix Sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view

Take One for the Team,G.O.O.D. Fridays,2010.0,"Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans

You know what, though? I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

Hehe
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Music!
Yeah, ugh

You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people kids
I hate plastic couches in other people cribs
I hate when other people cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said, ""I just cleaned up, baby, I can't tell""
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God damn cucumber Bath and Body Works?
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the La-Di-Da-Di verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I scored, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt

Doin' my thing (Hah), pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Ehh)

If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'ma take, I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Rosé and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone
The real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights, baby, that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

Doin' my thing, pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Yeah)

Looks like I'ma have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta

Take it for the team (I like your mentality, baby)
Take it for the team (Hahahahaha)

(CyHi!) Playin' with her kitty, made her come in the car
(CyHi!) She a redbone but her cousin is dark
(CyHi!) A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complainin' 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying to fuck, she talkin' 'bout she want to eat first
I'm like, ""Why did this bitch have to bring her?""
Tryin' to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said, ""I got a chick for you that look like a singer
On a scale of one to ten, she's a fifteen-er""
Man, you shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team, she would be a fifth-stringer
I said, ""I got the fine one in the Bimmer
I'm the point guard and I need a wing, take it for the team""

Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

You know, um a lot of people define success differently
You know for me
You can have everything
You could have all the money in the world

Mama’s Boyfriend,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ugh
Ugh, ugh-ugh

I never liked you niggas
Who knew, one day, I'd be just like you niggas?
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

He walked in our lives; I was only five
Superman pajamas, I was super-duper fly
The roof a new design, like, at least Hooper size
You know I scrutinize, like, ""Who this newer guy?""
I'm my mama boyfriend, I'm her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasn't
Tryna get to know me, homie? Just kill the charm
You ain't interested in me—you just tryna fuck my mom
We are the voices of our parents' bad choices
The aftermath of divorces, the kids of bitter split-ups
And babysitters, grandparents that don't know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is Mama's new nigga
You ol' Old Spice-wearing, short chain-wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants-wearing, church sock-wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance?
When you get here anyway? I already got parents
Don't try to put me in line, I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it, I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama—how Anita got Clarence
Yeah, I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her that'd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I scread out, ""I ain't going to sleep no time soon!
And when I do, I'm sleeping in my mama room!""

""I don't like you, nigga
If I was old enough, I'd fight you, nigga
I want to run over you with my bike, you nigga
Don't go to sleep at night, you nigga""
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?

Twenty years later: Where has the time gone?
Now, a nigga dating, having problems of hisown
And now, a nigga grown, and the tables turned around
I never thought I'd ever raise another nigga's child
He don't like his mama boyfriend—just like me
Don't wanna do the wrong thing, that's very un-Spike Lee
But he be like Deebo round his mama 'nem
'Cause when she here, he be quiet
When she leave, he be talking again
He be wilding again—be calm
I don't drink the drama or sip the Dom Tyler Perry-on
""You gon' marry my mom?""
Look, I don't read palms, and I don't read Psalms
But I did take lil' man to church, took lil' man to school
""Look, lil' man: Kids don't make the rules
Even though I ain't raised you, and you your mama angel
Don't get it twisted, baby boy—I'll Ving Rhames you""

I never liked you niggas
Who knew, one day, I'd be just like you niggas?
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
Ugh-ugh-ugh, all right, you niggas
When I become my mama's boyfriends?
When I become my mama's boyfriends?",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-mamas-boyfriend-lyrics
Hey Mama (Grammy Version),UnKnown,2008.0,"Bom bom bom bom bom

Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me no curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz somebody cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you Mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
Mama, you know I love you so, and I'll never let you go
And I wrote this song just so you know that when you go

Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
Last night I saw you in my dreams
Now I can't wait to go to sleep
My mama, mama, mama
I wanna scream so loud for you, cause I'm so proud of you
And let me tell you what I'm about to do
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
And I appreciate what you allowed for me and I

And this life is all a dream

2016 MTV VMAs Speech,UnKnown,2016.0,"I am Kanye West, and that feels really great, especially to say this year.
 
I came here to present my new video,
 but before that, I'ma talk. 
Now... Later tonight, ""Famous"" might lose to Beyoncé, but I can't be mad—I'm always wishing for Beyoncé to win, so, you know!
 But for people to understand just how blessed we are. It was an expression of our now. Our fame right now. Us on the inside of the TV. 
You know, just to put... the audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump... I mean, like, I put Ray J in there, bruh! This is fame, bro! Like... I see you, Amber!
 
My wife is a G, not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that!
 
We came over in the same boat, now we all in the same bed. Well... maybe different boats, but you know.
 
If you think about it, last week, it was 22 people murdered in Chicago.
 You know, like, people come to me like, ""Man, that's right! Tell Taylor to..."" Bro, like, I love all y'all! 
That's why I called her!
 
So, I was speaking at the Art Institute last year and one kid came up to me and said, ""Three of my friends died and I don't know if I'm gonna be the next.""
 And it has to... you know, you have to think like, you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work? If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- 
and uh, they tell me, ""Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney.""
 And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh!
They tell me, ""Don't compare yourself to these people,"" right?
 My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. 
My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history.
 
Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West
(Audience cheer) Bro! Broooo!
Tonight, we're here to have fun. I'm standing in front of my idol, Puff Daddy. I'm standing in front of my wife, Kim Kardashian West. 
I'm standing in front of the future, Chance The Rapper, 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. Bro!
 We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. 
I'm gonna play y'all a piece of my art and I hope y'all have a good time",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2016-mtv-vmas-speech-lyrics

Brothers forever

[Verse 1: Kanye West & 
Charlie Wilson

We should've lit cigars, when your baby was born
Should've shouted you out and dedicated a song (
Oh, oh
)
I can say I was wrong, I can take the blame
'Cause brothers don't always have to share the same name
(
Oh, oh
)
We met when we was young, I forgot the grade
When last one to base was a rotten egg
Since then I done good and rotten things (
Brothers forever
)
So I could tell you one thing (
Brothers forever
)
As soon as I cut the grass low
It's easier to see the assholes
So I'm sorry for all the miscues
How about I admit that I miss you
I miss the fam and our brotherhood
I just wanna make sure that my brother's good
So I ain't embarrassed or above (
Eh, eh
)
Flying out to Paris for a hug
Or picking up the phone just to call up (
Ooh
)
Picking up the phone hope it's all love
'Cause Jesus taught us love, so did Moses and Mohammed (
Ooh
)
So nothing so atomic that we can't agree to drop it, chop it
Peace it up and get it poppin'
And bury the hatchet so we can lock in (
Ohh-oh

Why don't you still have him on the line?

I wish I had a PA system for all the brothers we love
For the ones that was missing but joined the cut where we from
See how the DA did 'em, when they was hustling drugs
And that was in the city of brotherly love
See brothers are amused by other brother's reps
But it takes a real one to keep the other in check (Other in check)
So this fraternity's for eternity (
Brothers forever
)
And every rhyme I write is 25 to life (
Brothers forever

Every dime I wife thought I was Brian McKnight
And my homies said that you should shine your light
And the groupies gave us the time of our life
And I think about those times when I'm flying a flight
And I knew we'd reconnect when the timing was right
Man, I ain't spoke to you in like forever (
Brothers forever

Maybe it's time we put the band back together

London Speech,UnKnown,UnKnown,"How y'all feeling tonight?
Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu-type performance I just set up
I love the energy in this city
This is one of my hometowns, y'all know I stayed out here, right?
But I came here for the creativity more than anything,
Because creativity fuels everything
I hate business people
People get on the phone with me and talk to me
Like ""What kind of business can he do though?
What type of businnes are you doing? What's the numbers?
How much did you sell? What's the radio spins?
How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?""
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?
Make it even more mellow, make it just the chords

Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
I know it's for more than just to get rich.
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Since when was making art about getting rich?
I know it's easy for me to say
Because having money's not everything and not having it is
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why the Grammy's could suck my dick?
Remind me who's the original superfly
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie
Remind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?
Every nigga tryna get rich,
Every rapper tryna get rich,
And every rapper always rap about fucking somebody else bitch
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
And why the Grammys can suck my dick
Suck my dick

And every motherfucking sponsor
They tryna put they logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet and greet
And you gotta meet the execs and they daughters
And they'll show what they just bought her
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
They say ""Ayo, you coming on too strong in this bitch""
They always talking about what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I can give a fuck everything
I can give a fucking anything
Remind me why we in this shit
I lost my motherfucking momma
So I can give a fuck about your comments
I promise, I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
But I'mma live my life my way!
Remind me why we in this shit, please

Please, can I sell your drink for you, please
""So, you can help me put on a better show please, corporations?
Can you please support me? Please?
Me, Kanye West. I swear I’m a nice nigga now
I swear I’ll put the pink polo back on,
I swear to you. Please. Just for 3 million
I need it so bad. I need a pool in my backyard!
So I’ll tell all my fans your shit is cool
And if they believe in me, then they should also believe in you
""‘Did we get the check yet? Hold on, I gotta call the business manager
Did the corporations send the check?
What is my public rating? Are people liking me again?
Enough to get some money from the corporations?
Are they liking me, is it ok now?
They forgot about the whole Beyoncé thing, right?
Ok, Cool.
Is it ok now?""

Remind me why we in this shit
Remind me why we in this shit
Cause we ain't on no pile of shit
Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart
And I live and I die by everything that I say
And everything that I do
And everything that make is what I believe to be true
And if the shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense
I don't give a fuck because that was my stream of conscious
And that's the way I felt at that time
And feelings was the only facts
And racism and materialism is killing blacks
And one more thing if I can ask
One more thing if I can add

Cause in this life, our life just moves to fast
And time is somethng tht you can never get back
What's your quality of life?
What's your quality of life?
And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight
I hope you have a good time tonight
London, it's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight

An inspiration, not lead instruments
I'm the lead instrument, but he's background
Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen
My friend Louis Gold, Christopher King, Stella McCartney
And Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume

But it's still sometimes like there's no good ideas
And no real ideas and nothing sincere left
And everything has been so homogenized
And it's all big business and it's no creativity
But really we have the ability to have a human Utopia
If we just helped each other
If we just use our resources
And stop tryna compete against each other
And tryna beat each other
And eat each other
And maybe came together and tried to teach each other
And reach each other
And reach each other
Maybe try to come together and love each other
And love each other
And love one another
Maybe try to come together and love each other
And love each other
And love each other
And love another
And love each other
And love each other
And love each other
And love another
The way you love you love your mother man
The way you should love your father man
Y'all don't really understand
Cause this is our shit
And is this our motherfucking clique
Clique, clique clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique
Clique, clique, clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique
Clique, clique, clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-london-speech-annotated

Wait, just need two more shows just to get to me
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it

Or maybe if it's sicker, they say I'm ""that nigga""
Or maybe if  is not a cellphone 
Or maybe damn, I could just blow my shit 
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
Maybe I should  I could reconsider

Something I can explain how to
I can't speak for everybody, but, uh
Man...

There must be more good women than men, percentage-wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasn’t bi, no, I seen it in her eyes
But I'm like any other guy, trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah, fuck it, I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright, I'm just getting by
She had a lil' weed and we get a lil' high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo, back in 92', I was just like you
Please, don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other nigga, buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think, yeah, Free's banging but she's no Rachel

We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

Was it something I did wrong? Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt, yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work, yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
""You never listen to me,"" then the call drop... hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Tryin' to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty g's to fifteen hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call, one ring, two rings, seven rings
Eight rings, er mother picked up the phone
Like, ""She in school and she don't stay here no more""
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

We ball 'til we fall, hit the mall
After we hit, don't call
We fill your lives with nothing but lies
And I would like to apologize
No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-apologize-lyrics
Nina Chop (Chance The Rapper Version),UnKnown,2016.0,"Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know

Good God! Midwest coast back, nigga
And don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black, nigga
Free country, they say that shit in Tennessee
'Cause I got all their white daughters drinkin' Hennessy
I'mma go to Sal's with some niggas on the wall
I might go to Oz, take some niggas off the wall
Got the key to the city, the streets on lock
Tryna take 'em to the top, they say Chano's so involved
I know, King Dolo, 3rd, even the group solo
It's been that way since my shirt had two Polos
We the kids they'll keep in the back
I'm in love with my city, bitch I sleep in my hat
I'm a free agent, go and do the math
Underdog of underground, Tubman with the path
They ask about the help and all I do is laugh
I say God my only boss, even Moses had a staff

You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?

Home,Get Well Soon...,2004,"Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boy, and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home, oh, never leave me alone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home

My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin' again
And if they hatin' on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cos she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said ""It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me""
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""'Ye, keep making that platinum and gold for me!""
But if you really cared for her
Then you woulda never hit the airport and followed ya dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seem like she talkin bout me
She said, ""You left ya kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin bout, what niggas tryin to do, just not new""
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds, spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin about Chi-Town

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers ain't make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Oh, never leave me alone

MTV VMAs 2015: Vanguard Acceptance Speech,UnKnown,2015.0,"Bro. Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It’s beautiful. Jeremy Scott's design.
First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I’m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, ""Oh, you’re not that bad after all."" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?
Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y’all know y’all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it’s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.
The, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn’t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy’s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... ""SexyBack"" album, and bro….Justin I ain’t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, ""He deserve to win Album of the Year.""
And this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I’m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!
I still don’t understand award shows, I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don’t understand it bro. I don’t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don’t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!
Two thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite. Y’all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don’t know what’s gonna happen tonight, I don’t know what's going to happen tomorrow bro.
But all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don’t never, you know what I’m saying, I’m confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We’re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we’re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.
I don’t know what I’m finna lose after this. It don’t matter though, it ain’t about me, it’s about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth.
And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for President.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-mtv-vmas-2015-vanguard-acceptance-speech-annotated

Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, I know, I know when I see it

Pacing, thinking, to myself

I'm finna get on this TV and put shit down
I ain't finna let these light skinned niggas come back in style
I'm finna turn this class clown shit to crazy G's
They told my Momma I was bipolar, had A.D.D
I told 'em w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers'll fool ya
Hating on you to their mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the ten-karat gold
That get green on you, when you get green on 'em
You gotta wash your hands of 'em, get clean on 'em
Somebody told me success is the best revenge
So they gon' be fucked up when you do your thing on 'em
Now hold your plaques high, like who would've thought?
And tell em *ahem ahem ahem*, thank you for your no support

They are the dream killers, they the dream killers
Who know a dream? Uh, they are the dream

They the dream killers, they the dream killers
Dream, they are the dream

Now how you going to talk about the way I spend my money?
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hating, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
'Cause we the leaders and they the followers
And we the nut busters and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit, dog, and they the flies
How you gonna tell me how to live my life?
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right?
They are the misery that loves company
'Cause that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told 'em I finished school, then I started my own business
They said, ""Oh you graduated?"" Nah, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship then break your marriage up
Can't kill your dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay you or embarrass you
Come around with you but they ain't down with you
They the dream killers

(Killer Norman Bates)

And I'm through spitting these rappers my most heartfelt flow
'Cause they be like, ""That's cool, you got some beats for me though?""
Oh, I get it, you want to be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a fuck what you got to say
Anyway, what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out your house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put your fist to your spouse, so how you gon' move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even taking wagers in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about peace, they gon' be like, ""Peace?""
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the East
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York? What, you ain't never took a tour there?
What, you ain't know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?

Know they want me to fall, but my balance is just
You weren't with me when them struggles and battles was tough
So I cut your head off 'fore I give you a cut
When they tell me I can't do it, it give me a rush
Ain't got this type of bank account 'less you 50 and up

Go with whoever, I ain't got no pick
Come through just to get that flick

Get back, go down

On the 2009 VMAs (2),Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016,"I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song. For the times that I've, like, defended myself...
I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month! When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days. I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying. Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé. As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it. Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns

Why are you so angry? What's the anger?

Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit! I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit. My mother died because of this shit. Fuck MTV
It ain't no love. What the fuck was Pink performing? Don't nobody know that song. Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the fuck Pink perform twice and I didn't even get asked to perform ""Heartless."" ""Heartless"" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter! I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink! They put me in a fuckin' room and projected it

How the fuck did Eminem get the Best Hip-Hop song in 2008?

Eminem won Best Video! Rap Video! Yo, when he won that shit, I was so happy. I was so happy I ran all this shit. I said, ""Nigga, I'm gon' do this until y'all put a bullet in my head. I'm runnin' up to y'all, put a..."" ",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-the-2009-vmas-2-lyrics

Hot 97 Freestyle,UnKnown,2010.0,"Malice found religion
, 
Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
A birdseye view got me channelling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all is forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
Grants, Jacksons no room for George
Yeh, the Fear of God’s in you muthafuckers
This art imitate my life
You WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation hype
Eliminate the fools gold and imitation ice
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
Help my young bitch see her way through her Bachelor's
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
What goes around comes around, this is lifes ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parrallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
Villian like candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata
, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
And sold your dreams, you don’t know who did it
I treat the cash, the way the government treats aids
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it
I need more drinks and more lights
Hot American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
Told to take them glasses off and get in the pool
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Its like a crip said: “I got way too many blues for any more bad news”
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
What’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
But God said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it,
 
do my thing while I’m got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m going after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowing up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, its like that ya’ll
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Uh, I let you into my diary to admire me
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I’m drawing from both sides, I’m Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, 
entrada
Rip me apart and see what’s inside this pinata
And rolling kilos in gymstrada is one saga
One chapter of black magic, I’m Harold Potter
Feels like I’m doomed to dealing with women whom
Relationships with their fathers won’t allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas nights was awesome
But adios I blow my own dice before I toss ‘em, loss ‘em
Some other muthafuckers double crossed ‘em
Tryna snatch my nigga back I blew a small fortune
Russell with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I’m muthfucking Gorgeous, wooooooooo
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smtih
Whiter than the coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But the devil red, tires double tread
I’m posting parks up. that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look what the devil did
Yeah

It’s hip hop, this is euphemism for a new religion
The soul music for the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing to attention
As long as I’m in Polo’s they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever saw a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't running shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, on the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
And I assisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, fans can't resist it
Remember, remind of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever one of the greatest homie, I must have missed it!",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-hot-97-freestyle-lyrics

Only I can mention me

See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last time I was down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me ho
Told you four times, don't test me, ho
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in a Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a ho
And I...

Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let 'em get to me

You gon' have to get used to me

Yeah I've been broke, now I'm good, bitch
I ain't no Kennedy, but I'm hood rich
So I say my way to thank you to the ghetto
And everybody else, thank you very little
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beaten, but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though, we needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us like we almost white

How I'm the only one eatin', shut your pie hole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though?
Why? Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro!
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Awww, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nawww, he's got titties under his shirt


It go my way, Chi-Way, this way or the highway
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, fuck that, dog, I get my own way
Niggas ain't believe me, 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay four stars or better
Cause the couches in the rooms got more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress Ardjo, but only pay partial

What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
Okay, 
They ordered champagne, why they look thirsty?
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
It's like the first time back in the basement
 aced it
 make this
Mmm, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

Okay, uh, let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know you're wondering, how is Kanye spittin' so hot?
'Cause I listen to the Roc and I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money, yeah, I know I'm a dummy
But what I'm supposed to tell a girl in the club
While that ass is getting feeled on
What, I bought a couple build-ons?
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
'Cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children, feel him?
Probably not though, 'less you got dough, you know what I mean
You would think the grass greener when you finally get green

Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

Man, I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years, ain't picked a career
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
'Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and

Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

Man, I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this!""
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a Coupe

Let me hear you say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay

And uh, I decided to stop fuckin' with y'all

And they probably didn't tell you that’s what suckers niggas do

Where You At? (The Whole City Behind Us),Charge It to the Game,UnKnown,"Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When The Dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melyssa Ford
'94 I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest
Where you at? The whole city behind us

Where you at? The whole city behind us
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Where you at? The whole city behind us

It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
To shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights
May be long days but it's fright nights
Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'
Not the club; I stay in the get right!
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P


It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin column
Of Impalas in to get holla
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college, got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
To all the Y.G.s in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every color like Ice-T
I might be the city of Compton's right knee
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf
Of Luda and Kanyeezy, I'm gon' breathe easy

If I'mma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gonna be some different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyoncé, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says ""is that Jesus?""
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick

Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's,
 
Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits? Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys

If it matters, I'm embarrassing
Think about the state of mind
Think about my mind state, it's passive (Passive)
A few milli's spent on bad habits, the other half went taxes
And that goes to anybody with money in that bracket (What?)
The state of rapping, the freshmens in all the classes
All the super seniors mumblin' rappin'
Mumblin and ramblin'

Yeezus Listening Party Speech,UnKnown,UnKnown,"If you ever see somebody next to me, know that they're better than me at something
So -- bars. Bars
So it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously, the way we put this shit together, y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us. In the way this whole albums put together.
 
The amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively, collaboratively.
 
We didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in, anything.
 
We just wanted to make the best product possible.
 
And this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people.
 
What I said last night is like
, 
we drop this shit June 18th
. 
This ain't about waitin' until August and havin' some big this and that.
 
It's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to, ride to, listen to while y'all workin' out and shit. Whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out. We gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over. Makin' shit for my core, my cut
With the creative director 
Matt Williams
 and 
Virgil Abloh
, the whole team, 
Don C,
 
Ibn
, 
all the Been Trill family,
 and the combination of all the people we brought together from 
Daft Punk workin' like 3-4 joints on the album.
 The first joint 
""Onsite"", ""I Am A God"",
 bless me, and 
Mike Dean
. 
Travis Scott
 workin' on the album, 
Hudson Mohawke
, 
Arca.
 And of course, at the end, last -- wait a second, am I forgettin' some people and shit?
Last, but not last, that came and helped bring this whole shit together, the executive producer of this LP and the family, is 
Rick Rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us
. Which is legendary because everything we did on this project, everything I get like when we release 
'Numbers on the Boards"",
 
from the video to the ""NO ARTWORK"" to the sound of the song and everything.
 I was like, 
""What would Rick Rubin do? What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?""
 
Because I remember like Ricky would say, ""When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct.""
 Where we at right now? 
We in the middle of the city right now,
 
over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music
 and yall vibin out to this shit.. 
So it's good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit.
 Ask him questions and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and brought it to a whole new level. 
And I wanted to explain something about the title Yeezus
Simply put: West was my slave name and Yeezus is my god name",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-yeezus-listening-party-speech-lyrics
Back to Basics,Freshmen Adjustment Vol. 3,2005.0,"Uh, uh, let's take it back to basics
When shit gets worse, we converse
How we need a new balance
Before the lines get crossed like Asics
Just look at what we got, if we don't shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back
I don't wanna have to check you
I'm Chi as Buck-Fiftys and Pelle Pelle leathers
Some say my beats made the Bulls play better
I say, black on black is the hate that hate made
Sara Lee with the dough, I'm talkin' bout the cake maid
McDonald's with the flow, served over a billion
You've seen the video, words over the building
Uh, I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give you this feeling
And when 
the Workout Plan
 ain't work out, man
Me and Common is back on the corners again
On the corner

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
I open my eyes, the corner is like African tribes
The black is subsidized, the black enterprise, the passion arise
The youth fantasize, who got some cash in they eyes
If youth dies, mamas askin' rationalize
Tryna build a spot where ghetto bastards could rise
The ghetto has been bastardized by those that capitalize
Wonder if it's a plan that the master devised
To bring his people to a land where the blacks are despised?
On the corner",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-back-to-basics-lyrics

Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card

My tracks is better than yours

Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill 
You could be Lauryn Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'mma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now y'all just prayin

My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge

You was a vic in high school, now you a thug?
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price
On the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggas see the light, got fat girls eating right

Ballin' money woos, woos, woos
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign

I could  when you had me on

No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but

And if you ever don't than get at me, at me

We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week

No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
(There's no proof)
Those on clouds
Learn to debate YAH
Ain't no love in the playground
(Now I'm speaking truly loud)
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
Ain't no love in the playground
(Waiting by your phone)
That's a long way

And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder
Thunder

And forget all your cares

Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

I spent my last eight checks-s-s on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shit
She wanna sip up on the Crissy Cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister in that white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie, they only fives but together they ten
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm
It's like old folks pissin' 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin', this track got you movin'
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head 'til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fore I pay for this room 'cause

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

Now if you got it, you got it
And if you don't then you probably won't
Sissy nigga call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
Buy 'em boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-need-to-know-lyrics
All Dreams Real,Unreleased Songs,2010,"It's real, all dreams real
My boy text me, he told me, ""Dream big""

Like the cars that we own now, 'member we used to lease it
Now we undefeated, look at what the team did

All dreams are real
All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real
All dreams, real, real

Spirit of Coltrane with us
Old slang, you know the old sayin'
Ho's saying, ""He sold out,"" out the stores, mane
I like soul beats and pj's, I'm so plain
Opps crowded around my house like I was Houssein
Came and grabbed me out my house like I was insane
Doc sayin', ""There's somethin' wrong with his membrane""
I've been sufferin' from lack of sleep, bitch, I been drained
Gotta high type of tolerance for that type of pain
Pour some, I wan' go numb 'till it's okay
Here we go, I'm off the drink and now we in things
We was lowkey, heard you wanted to avenge things
We approached, we ain't gon' make it 'till the endgame
Guess that's just what he got to do to get the rent paid
I ain't gon' hate on no man to get a bill paid
Bills ain't the real pain, the real pain is real pain
Your self-hate, self-doubtin', fake love
But

All dreams, real (Real)
It's that no limitations, babe
All dreams, real (Real)

Yeah, 'Ye cold
But that Trump hat forced me to feel like I like J. Cole, damn
My own city turned they back on me
They thought I told Push about Drake's son, goddamn
Like I ain't want them to run, goddamn
I guess they fall and they dumb, goddamn
I don't care about his son, goddamn
I just rap about me, goddamn
Niggas can't resist publicity for free, goddamn
Always wantin' somethin' like it isn't me, goddamn
Everytime, I rap it, this ain't charity, goddamn
Energy that never die, energy that stay alive
Energy, the synastry I'm finna see a synesthesia
I could see ya, color feel ya
Bona feature, extra features
I'm allegiant, all the deats, all the features
And the teachers and the preachers
They could reach us on the feature
All the leaches, all my features
I was just in the bleachers
Jump the bleachers, I'm a thesis
That's my thesis, Holy Jesus
Um

All dreams, real (Real)
All dreams, real (Real)

Drop Dead Gorgeous,I’m Good,2002,"Whooooooooooo
Damn, that girl fine, that girl fine, that girl fine
Yo, yo, Kanye, yo turn it up, a little bit, whoo

Take notes while I take tokes to the marijuana smoke
One look and murder she wrote
She drop dead gorgeous, she drop dead..

Yo, this is a Roc-a-Fella, St. Lunatics collaboration
Chi-Town and St. Louis
She said she ain't never seen Murphy Lee befo'

I called her back from an earlier beep
Fo' in the mornin' they be like ""Nah, I wasn't sleep""
Convenient whore stay on top of convenient stores
Keep pictures of me in their Victoria Secret drawer
I keep somethin' hot on tour
Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell
Hehehehehehehehe hell, I remember when she smashed LaBelle
See most women kinda sneaky like a six-year old
Hey yo they always in the summer, somethin' wrong with their nails


What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?
Jimmy Choo, Frankie B., bitch you gettin' expensive
I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me
That ain't no male friend that bought you the stereo
She said ""He gay anyway, you don't know nothin' about Jamario""",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-drop-dead-gorgeous-lyrics

On Albums and Radio,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016,"I'd like to thank everybody who came out tonight to rock with me.
 You could have been anywhere in the world. You could have been anywhere in the world...
This is the part of the show where I start complaining about shit, justifying shit, but you know how it is.
 I'm just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all. 
You know with this album, we didn't drop no single for radio; we ain't have no big NBA campaign or nothing like that
, 
we ain't even got no cover.
 We just made some real music
Back when I used to make albums and shit like a couple years ago, 3 years ago, like 4 years ago
, 
we'd go away and work on an album for like 5 months or something
, 
we'd always have to hold the album til like August or September for the perfect moment or some shit. Because it means that you're probably gonna sell more, get more audience and radio and shit
But, honestly, at this point, when I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more.
 
And, honestly, at this point
, 
I could give a fuck about selling a million records
 
as long as I can put out an album this summer that you guys can rock to all motherfucking summer.
 Y'all don't tell me I'm gonna sell more records. Because at this point, I don't really give a fuck about outside opinions. 
All I give a fuck about is my clique-clique-clique....",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-albums-and-radio-lyrics

He's killing y'all niggas on the beats
He's killing y'all niggas on the tracks
Where your plaques at, dog?
The game is officially over
Go kill yourself

Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

Now y'all gon' stop talking that shit that you talking
Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the hell she gon' afford that coffin
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the Chi since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggas had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggas postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters, dog
Niggas had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards
Now after all that it took, I made it to The Roc
I guess I ain't as dumb as you look

Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

Now I showed you how to do this, dog
Put a few beats on the tape, I saved this one for myself
I heard you niggas' tapes, need a little bit of help
But I'm rapping and I can't do nothing for you man
Ask G and Hop this, 40 grand if you ain't fam
I mean, if you ain't Hov, if you ain't Cam
Damn I know you say he's killing hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feeling hisself
Yup just cause I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who your hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
Here go a new movie for you critics called ""Who's Laughing?""
The first producer that rap better than the rappers

Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka
Now take that and equipment back to the store
We don't wanna hear that weak shit no more
Do anybody else make hits anymore
Guess not mothafucka, it's the Roc mothafucka

Lunatics still making them hits, nigga
So So Def still making them hits, nigga
Bad Boy still making them hits, nigga

Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer, yeah
Officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check out the similarity
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you from what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuin'
The overseer had the right to get ill

The officer has the right to arrest

Y'all had your fake leaders, don't worry, we got it

I know you and grandma had enough for them (Boy)
Why I gotta be so stubborn then? (Boy)

A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost. You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I’m saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think?

Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.
Radio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’ma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’ma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Aye, is it, “'Radio, fuck you?' That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly.
Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KRS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro! A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro! Bari is alive tonight, bro! Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro! Rocky alive tonight, bro! Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not! Go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas, they got me and Cudi. It’s life.
We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia! We can love each other! But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and 92.3 and everybody; is it just me, or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free?” Aye, aye! You know what it is, though? Because, aye, I love Drake, I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro!
And let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always! I’m on my Trump shit tonight! Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back! The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned! The vibes is back! I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight!
Khaled, I know you got hitters from Miami. Please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga! You got the keys! But, as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this - AAAH! - and still win! He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro!
So, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something: I was hurt. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and I don’t expect MTV to help me. 'Mr. West, I don’t respect you. I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”' They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Hey, bruh, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’ma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt! I went down seven years on behalf of your —hey, nigga, don’t throw no shit while I’m talking! I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this! This is a moment in the matrix, bro! The vibes is back! The vibes is back! Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight.
Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over ""Hotline Bling."" In my opinion — now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great, Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal!
But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh! I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sitting here to give y’all the truth.
Jay Z, call me, bruh! You still ain’t calling me! Jay Z, call me! Aye, bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man! I’m not trying to be the man, I just am a man, the same as anybody here! I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal! We all equal! This is the vibes, bro! This is the future. This is the way of thinking to make America great again! Haha, you didn’t like that! Guess what? Y’all need the vibes! I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro! The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro.
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world! Feelings matter! Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Hey, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie. We growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye. And wait a second, do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second, I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!
People, I’m not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times! Because guess what? The Saint Pablo Tour is the most relevant shit happening! The Saint Pablo Tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton! You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over and then you wake up, you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google. You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!
Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now?! Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg?! Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Ebony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t! Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro! The vibes is back!
 Aye, John, take it all the way back to the beginning.
Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way. Give him a call.
Q-Tip, I love you, bro. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me, I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared! I’m here to change things! I am here to change things. And things won’t change until people admit their own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with. My vision! I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, press, get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready! Because the show’s over.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-radio-jay-z-and-mark-zuckerberg-annotated
Doing Fine,Freshmen Adjustment Vol. 1,UnKnown,"Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace

Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class
So I had to cop the baby mama Benz,
 
Jeep
With put fifty, I get this on the first tape
But that fifty that break the bank
Back when my ATM was crazy slim, 
had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop, she still made me spin
Back when '80s was in, my dog Crazy Ken had eighty of them
It's time to hit the dancefloor, you crazy again
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said, ""This car real old,"" I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
I'mma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside

Now I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, ""I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine""

Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, 
peace

Please, what I gotta win five Grammys
Before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys?
If I can't bone, I'll get a clone
Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbin', don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for Rocawear
More popular, 'cause I abracadabra my Nissan
To a car throwing a peace sign,
 peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K
And if CL like U-C-K,
 that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
I'm tryna find a crazy female with a cutie face
A big pimper on the DL, like UGK
And then I told her

I've been hustling my whole life
Tryna get this money up and I think I finally got it right
And I've been partying with this one girl
Who claim, ""I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff

You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they compe-tation
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Bone girls on TV so it's All-Star trains
Just picture man (Uh-huh), no snitchin' man (Uh-uh)
Somethin' for the fiends fresh out the kitchen, man
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave, 'til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas (Errr!)
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have no more
Uh, well, Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell Biggs that we about to get paid
All my niggas is 'bout to have it made
This makes everything else sound played
Goddamn, Kanye! (Kanye! Kanye!)
Now hold up! Ain't nobody messin' with me, dog
Now, you say it! (""Ain't nobody messin' with you at all!"")
I told dude, ""You can't even rap on my interlude""
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
(""When the album comin' out?"") Man, the people is askin'

After the sunshine, you thinkin' it might count
How could I might doubt? Just look at my account
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seeing niggas that ball, that shit was depressing
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressing
When I copped them pounds, it was my best investments
Dre got shot (Ugh) and that taught me a lesson
For stickin' niggas up and them rubbery masses
Mask like Batman, minus the tight pants
Would hit your baby momma but her elbows is ashy (Uh-uh)
Four different blues, man, your outfit is clashin' (Ha!)
You ain't got no muscles, you weakling bastard (Haha)
Man, look at your haircut
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, NAW, your hair sucks!
How many niggas you know is really heavy hitters?

On Truthfulness,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2013.0,"I got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.'
 He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off 
and that was Muhammad Ali.
 But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. 
If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much.
 
Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight.
 
And I don't know if y'all have heard of
  Tesla, and I'm not talking about 
the car
, 
I'm talking about the inventor.
 
Or if y'all ever heard about  Jodorowsky,
 the director who made 
Holy Mountain
. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 
'creative genius,'
 I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. 
And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour.
 And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who , 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. 
And I wish you could see my tears right now
. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now.

The diamond industry want me, they say I'm bringin' out the bad
What I want, people to stop buyin' diamonds?
No, I want everybody to stop lyin'
They say conflicts is only one percent, and look at all the money rappers spent
We throw the diamonds in the screen, nah mean?
But it affects the families cause people is dyin' for these things
I mean in the diamond rivers they'll mine all day

We goin' to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say
Uh, uh

I got so many joints right know, runnin' through my head
I 'on't even know what to yeah
What should, what should I spit?
I could just freestyle off of these messages
Please can you tell
Okay this is a girl writin' this
Please can you tell my uh, boyfriend Danny
That I love him loads, with all my heart
And I can't wait to see him tomorrow

She can't wait to see you tomorrow Danny
She love you, mhmm
You know what that mean?
You gonna get some
I wonder if she gon' be wearin' one of those tight outfits
And you know that I like that shit
I ain't sayin' I ever met her but come on
You must be pimpin' and you ain't sweat her, you know?
She writin' you on one of these hip-hop shows
Made me wonder if she's a hip-hop ho
No disrespect, you know
I don't know you so
I will not disrespect, so don't please press eject
On the tape cassette, and don't knock it out of your decks
So with much respect, obliged, when I rhyme
Sometimes some things just pop out, sometimes
I must be a, I forgot the medical name
Not a narcoleptic that be sleepin'
How people was sleepin' when I made it deeper
And I gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it
Uh, they call me Rockafella's best little secret
Uh, I got the beats for the Jeep
When people used to rock Amigo's and Suzuki's
And the Isuzu's, this the way you flow
Do flow, aye yo you just like Menudo
Played out about mad years ago
And uh, I could rock off the top, I got years of flow
I got so many albums to go, at least about seven
Jesus Walks had me all the way
Thought I was gon' rhyme that, no you didn't time that
Yo that's where the line's at
Look at my shows, look how long that the line's at
All the way to the back, sold out, one night
That's the way it is when you done it right
Take time to drop a album, don't just be buyin' beats from everybody
Cause everybody ain't got it, I got it
I get it, I only give it to those who really live it
Like Jay-Z, the Game, and my dogs that really did it
Like Kweli, like Common, like dudes that really spit it
I'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it
And as far as makin' your songs, it's all wrong
You be doin' everything that everybody else is on
Man, I'mma break it down, let me take it down
Here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin'
Look, you take the crack concept
And you do that 'til it's all dead and gone, you do it all wrong
Now uh, you take the car concept
And I see it every video, every single place I go
Same shit

Man you know the beat ran out on me
I was gonna, I was gonna, I was gonna break down
(That was mean, that was mean!) I was gonna break down to people
Exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change
(Let's go, let's go, let's go!)

First of all, what you need's a beat from me
If you can't get a beat from me, get a beat from your guy
He'll prolly do it for free
And if he do it like  he'll prolly do it for E
And if he do , he'll prolly do it for skeet
Yo, yo-yo, yo-yo-yo, you gotta bring with your flow
You gotta take it on-beat and off-beat
And don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats
You know that real hard shit, regardless, I played my part in this
Like, this Corner beat, this what you want when you want a beat
And that's when you really is gonna be
A hip-hop legend like Kan, like Kan
Like, of course the Louis Vuitton, 'ton, don, don
If I do say so, myself
And I do all the time, every rhyme
Cause I'm, I'm feelin' myself
And if you was me, you'd be feelin' yourself, you see
If you out in London, you just hopped on a plane
And you just came out of the bathroom, you just got you some brain
Uh, you doin' your thing
And plus you flossin' that Rocafella chain
Aye yo, you know you let Kan spit on 'em
I'm rockin' the Rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em
Oh, oh
Now let me bring it back to the flow, flow
And how you make the album and you make some dough, dough
Get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up
Fuck your name up
And uh, if you've been runnin' to a 
Trade your chain for some studio time
See a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to
A lot of people want club records they wanna dance to
A lot of people want basslines, they will enhance you
Bass in the club is good too, what you should do
Is prolly get a single like Alicia Keys
And if you don't know her, holla at Alicia please
You know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids
Actin' like they got it made
 you give a dawg with a fade
You get somebody that's weak, you get somebody that you know can't flow
And you rap before him, and let him go
And people gon' be like well least you was better than dude
And  I don't mean to be rude
And another thing you can do
If you could channel the spirits like I channel
I'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles, I'm not talkin' sayonce
I'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to God, I mean just like once
What I do before I rhyme, every day is I pray
I pray to God that he make these songs in a certain way
I let him speak through me, through the beats, through the music
I mean, sometimes I go into the booth and lose it
I mean, I know he speakin' when I freak it in it a way
That I coulda never thought of somethin' better to say
So, our father, who art up above us
I know any time we fuck, you still love us
Like when I'm cursin' in my verses and I even do, what's worse is
When I'm spendin' too much, spendin' on purses
And shoes for my girl when I should be helpin' the world
Give back to the charity, he still don't embarrass me
He still let me be, He still keep it real
See that's the thing about humans, we got free will
See the angels gotta do exactly what God want 'em to do
God is still with you, even when we don't do
So, follow the path, follow the laws
Follow the reason, the reasons why it's wrong
You never heard a freestyle like this before-'fore
And I know that hip-hop fans want more

Westwood, what's good
Holla at your boy, Kanye the Louis Vuitton Don
The Roca stay, buildin'
Yeah, it's G.O.O.D. Music baby
After you freestyle like that you just talk shit for about eight minutes",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics
On Bonnaroo Music Festival,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2014.0,"Last time I got here, before I even arrived, they had ‘fuck Kanye’ on the motherfuckin’ port-a-potties. But this year, we gon’ piss on ‘em, on they motherfuckin’ port-a-potties.
How many of y'all don't give a fuck about what the press say? It's 2014. College Dropout came out 2004. I want y'all to know, every time I go to the studio, every time I do an interview, every time I make a motherfuckin' t-shirt, the thing I do, I give it everything I got. And when I talk that shit, it's so that you can talk that shit. If you a fan of me, you a fan of your motherfuckin' self. You can do something that'll change the world. Look at how they try to make me look. They try to make me look crazy. And the people that write that? I don't see them performing for 90,000 motherfuckers … I know you seen movies and shit. Jimi Hendrix. John Lennon. Jim Morrison. I know y'all seen movies and shit. But y'all livin' a movie right motherfucking now. Because I AM THE NUMBER ONE MOTHERFUCKING ROCK STAR ON THE PLANET.
You know, I had a meeting with Oprah Winfrey. She wanted to give me some advice. What she told me was that the corporations are scared of me. I'm like, 'Little ol' me?! Why you scared of me?! Because I tell the kids the truth?! Why y'all scared of me?!' Why they so scared of me? … Little ol' me?' Because I want peoples' minds to finally be free. What's the new cool? What's the new cool? Can you tell me what's the new cool? Because I want to hide behind that. I need some new barricade to hide behind. I need a new cool. What's the new shit out? What's the new shit out with the most commercials at the Super Bowl? Let's just stop the music and play a Bruno Mars song right now, how about that? They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I could never play at the Super Bowl. Not until I'm super old. Not until I'm super old … They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl. They told me I would never play at the Super Bowl, at least not until I'm super old. So I think it's time—hold up, f—k that toast.
But I promise y'all tonight, as I stand here, 37-years-old, this is only the beginning. This is only the beginning … Because in all honesty, I'm not gonna lie to y'all right now, this might not come off as humble, but I'm gonna tell y'all the truth. I ain't concerned about nobody that's actually living. I know people get mad at me when I compare myself, but that's the only way I can explain what my aspirations are. When I'm talkin' 'bout Walt Disney, when I'm talkin' 'bout Howard Hughes, when I'm talkin' 'bout Henry Ford, when I'm talkin' 'bout Beethoven, when I talk about Mozart, when I talk about Shakespeare, and they all had their time on this earth. And I'm only 37. And right now I'm rockin' to 90,000, of y'all motherfuckers right now. So I ain't goin' at anybody on the radio. I'm goin' after Shakespeare. I'm goin' after Walt Disney. I'm going after Howard Hughes. I'm going after David Stern. I'm goin' after Henry Ford. I'm going after Elon Musk. Okay, he is living, but he's my boy. Whether you believe it or not … you can only achieve as high as you believe. You can only achieve as high as you believe … And just like Martin had a dream, and just like Kendrick had a dream. I believe in everything. I believe in anything. You can only believe … I can only stand here when I been fucked up so many times. Fucked up so many times … And I know that I ain't perfect. But everything I'm not makes me everything I am.
I came to Bonnaroo six months after my mom passed. Pearl Jam went on three hours long. I did the Glow In The Dark show here. My shit was going on when the motherfuckin' daylight was comin' on. They said I was runnin' late. They blared my motherfuckin' tanks, my cryo, my pyro, they wrote 'FUCK KANYE' on that shit. Y'all wrote that shit in the press. WHERE THE PRESS AT? Y'all gonna write all these motherfuckers puttin' they hands up right now? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? WHERE THE PRESS AT? Man, I'll run that shit. This is real rock n' roll. If you ever grew up on real music, the reason why you write that shit about music? I'm from the South Side of Chicago. I dreamed of R. Kelly giving me a deal.
Somebody told me that everybody on the plane was coming out here to Bonnaroo, to come check me out, and you know, it humbled me. It humbled me, and at the same time gave me confidence. It gave me a quiet confidence, a steel confidence, a feeling that it was actually gonna happen, a feeling that it was God's plan. God's plan. God's plan, something I could never understand, understand, understand, it's all in God's plan. God's plan. God's plan. God's plan … So whether you believe it or not … the fact that there are so many people here tonight, it humbles me. It humbles me—but not in the Webster's definition of humility. It humbles me in a way that gives me strength, to know that it's in God's plan. And I know I set my goals very high.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-bonnaroo-music-festival-annotated
Oxford Lecture,UnKnown,2015.0,"I’ll take one question. I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of that…they said I’ve got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer
OK, everyone please be completely quiet, because I can literally hear a whisper, and it’ll throw off my stream of consciousness, and when I get my stream of consciousness going that’s when I give the best, illest quotes. Literally, a whisper can throw it off
Today was the first time I realised, If I could have done it again I would have gone to the Art Institute over the American Academy of Art, I would have researched where I could have got the best and the strongest education
And I’m sure this will end up online, so I don’t want to diss anyone at the American Academy, I’m sure it’s equal to the Art Institute of Chicago by now, but at the time I was going I would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers, and I kinda, the idea of being a fine artist, that’s a really difficult profession to get into, to be respected in, to make money at.  Maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label
My goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater
That always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much, and in your life you’re not even allowed to think that you can do as much. That’s a mentality that suppresses humanity
Some of you here probably remember the night when the Donda tweets came through me and I started talking about professions that you guys are going into, that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper. I was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion, race, gender, and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet
We have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we’re led by the most greedy and the least noble
What I notice about creatives is that, and one of the reasons why I get into trouble, is, not only do I want to design video games, or make music, or ride bikes, I think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past 30 years is my desire to play sports. I approach creativity like a sport, where if I have a drawing I react just like a jock: LOOK AT THE FUCKING DRAWING RIGHT THERE YEAH!
We’re all creatives here, we’re all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition
We were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas – that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way
There’s a Bible saying, ‘No weapon formed against me shall prosper’. Recently I’ve been doing interviews and I’ve had to go back to this verse because I don’t think there’s a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I also don’t think there’s one more prosperous. So what weapons have prospered? The smoke and mirrors of other opinions
I was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it’s completely different to the Brit awards
So it doesn’t get taken out of context, I’m going to use the word ‘like’. I’m not saying it is, I’m using it as a comparison. So people that want to say ‘Kanye goes to Oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah’. And I’m not telling you this. I’m telling you what I told Steve McQueen in private
What I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age
I compared it like, when the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that’s perception, that’s tradition. Attacking people from every which angle possible. If you have a focus wide and master senses like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion
It’s still February, right? (security guard shakes his head, everyone laughs)
By the way, I don’t know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is
We’d just look at each other and say, it’s still February. For the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world. Some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming. But nonetheless they came back to back to back to back. Answering every crazy interview question, blocking every shot, catching every rebound. Aside from the right I don’t have to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000. I know that’s incorrect also
This humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk about…it can only happen through collaboration
I love Steve Jobs, he’s my favorite person, but there’s one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn’t give the ideas up. That’s kinda selfish. You know that Elon’s like ‘yeah, take these ideas’. Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward. Maybe the stock brokers won’t like that, the stock holders wouldn’t like that idea, but ideas are free and you can’t be selfish with them
I think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named Drake (laughs, smirks, crowd laughs) you know, this idea of holding onto a number 1 spot. And then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever. Be it me, or Paul McCartney 
I understand that I’m a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people. Call Elon Musk out of the blue, or call Obama out of the blue…he calls the home phone, by the way
With that, I have a responsibility to serve. Why do I say the Matrix is like the Bible? What is my definition of the Matrix? 
I work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys
I’d see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and I’d say this toy isn’t quality. I don’t want my daughter playing with this. There’s not enough love put into this, this is just manufactured with the will to sell, and not the will of inspiration
Vanessa is very focused, she’s like my eyes, she’s a piece of my brain. She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole collection, that it’d play with the song Wolves, and based on this concept. And when my daughter saw these wolves, I’ve never seen her so happy. She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of one…I’ve never seen her happier than this moment. That level of happiness seems to be the thing that we’re fighting for every day, that we’re trying to buy back, trying to work for, especially in America
In America people really do wear $3000 shirts. For real. Here and in Stockholm people will be like ‘oh dude, it’s a $3000 shirt’
I’m assuming I’m probably wearing a $2000 shirt but I got it for free from the designer so
We’ve been sold a concept of joy through advertising, through car advertising, through fashion branding. It’s not the concept of time, time with your family, time with your friends, the little time that we do have on earth and what we do with that. It was somehow sold to us through a Gucci bag or something
Time is the only luxury. It’s the only thing you can’t get back. If you lose your luggage – I’m not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I’d normally say because I’ve got a meeting with them soon – if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can get that back. You can’t get the time back
It feels like people do everything in life to get this BMW, this Benz, to get this townhome, to get 2.5 kids exactly. One of them has to be small, y’know!
And you’re looking for this moment where you sit in your BMW after all the work you’ve done and all the accolades you get, and you somehow think you’re gonna get that level of joy that my daughter had when she received those wolves. And when you’re sitting in traffic in your BMW, it’s something that feels empty. To everyone who reaches that point. This concept of the selfish human, this idea of separation by race, or gender, or religion, or age, or my favourite thing to hate, class
People say it takes a village to raise a child. People ask me how my daughter is doing. She’s only doing good if your daughter’s doing good. We’re all one family
We have the ability to approach our race like ants, or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs
This is a generation that is far less racist – yes, small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur
White people that listen to rap say ‘nigger’…in the privacy of their own home
That idea , has passed. We’ve had The Cosby Show, Obama’s president, Beyonce’s great…that’s passed. But there’s still something you’re taught every day, especially in the UK, and that’s division by class. Our main focus, in my opinion…Imagine a world with no war, and imagine if everyone’s main focus, more so than going out to a club, their main focus was to help someone else
I was joking with an interviewer earlier today…people talk about the number of viewers the Brits get, or the number of viewers the Grammys get. They need to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn’t sell as many MasterCard commercials. Oh, I mentioned a brand! …I had two things…I was trying to get a flawless victory on my speech! No offence to MasterCard…but that was a big fucking logo in the middle!
You guys have been taught, without you knowing, ways to separate yourselves from each other. If you’re separated, you can be easily controlled. If you’re too busy pointing fingers at each other, rather than holding hands, you can’t get anything done
You know, Chris Rock called my album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy…well, Chris Rock and everyone else at every single media publication called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best album of the last 25 years. This only came through collaboration
One of the most memorable things about MBDTF was Nicki Minaj, and the fact that she kicked my ass, on my own song, on one of the best albums…the best album – I’m just saying what the critics said – of the last 25 years. The best album of the past 25 years that I spent a year and a half making, out there. I was exiled from my country, it was a personal exile, but exile. To come back and deliver my magnum opus of a work, and to be outshined…to be beat by a girl, basically
This was necessary. I think it was one of the most important points of working on that album, was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is. Just think of a comparison, if you think about why did it take so long for the new Yeezys to come out? Why did I have to leave one group and go to another group? Why did that group not want to speak to me? I think the Yeezys I was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse. Because these guys were like ‘we’re worrying about this shoe, we’re gonna put it on this celebrity’. And the head’s son would come and say ‘my favourite shoe is the Yeezy’. And it’s like ‘ahhh, I can’t hear about these YEEZYS anymore!’. Like everyone talking about Nicki’s verse, ‘I can’t hear about this verse anymore!’. It was gonna work for her anyway, but let’s just say that in some way in helped give her exposure. She was able to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide. And it was not locked because of my career
One of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, the very person, can remove my ego, I think there’s hope for everyone
When I talk about collaboration and the creative process, the best idea wins
I’m proud of the consistency of the performances I’ve done since I’ve been out here. And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work together. The best lighting guy on the planet, the best staging guy, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason…To be able to deliver, back to back to back, extremely successful, inspiring, groundbreaking, visual, visceral, creative moments that otherwise would have been challenged. And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the stage for 40 minutes in a row. I’ve had to pull that card out a few times. Not particularly screaming, but remember, I will scream
My momma taught me that if I was in a grocery store and I’m by myself and a stranger grabbed my hand, scream at the top of your fucking lungs. If I’m at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we’re going to use these moving lights, or we’re gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we’re gonna cut the TV cameras in a traditional way. I’ll scream at the top of my fucking lungs
People say I have a bad reputation. I think I’ve got the best reputation in the building. They want you to have a reputation of tucking your black nail polish into your pockets and sitting in the corner of the class, and not fighting for your ideas out of fear of being ridiculed
That’s one of my favourite ones…to be called crazy
I remember when I was young and saw my dad working on computers. And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad guy. And the guys that helped him, that he had the voice to find, didn’t have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to his vision, to his dream, for it to be considered to be a success. But the success is that his successor will be successful in his lifetime. You could say ""But you are successful?"" i’m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people. But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it’s something that is beating out of my chest. ‘Wait a second, I was middle class, and I didn’t get to see none of this shit!’
Let’s have an NBC telethon moment, and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!
It’s illegal to not wear clothes, and also possibly too cold. That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do! Clothing should be like food. There should never be a $5000 sweater. You know what should cost $5000? A car should be $5000. And you know who should work on the car? The people that work on the $500,000 cars. All the best talent in the world needs to work for the people. And I am so fucking serious about this concept that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it. Because I was 14 and middle class. I know what it felt like to not get what I have
People say to me ‘you’re successful, what are you crying about?’. I’m crying about the people. I’m crying about their daughters. Our daughters, as one family. What good is it? What good is anything that everyone can’t have? Every ism. They think we’re done with racism. What about elitism, what about separatism, what about classism? That’s all",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-oxford-lecture-annotated

So unusual to be in this position
Everything I say everybody tryna diss ‘em
Everybody playin him, truth be told
The last nigga ever let the truth be told
And oh Mos Def ran to my home
And said they gon have yo ass gone
Light jokes, you keep playin with them white folks
Can't even take the piss
They gon’ test your urine
Cut all the sponsorship for the touring!
“Where the Dark Fantasy tour at Ye?”
I dont know, ask, ask Hennesy (thats Coca-Cola)
Say ‘he ain't clean enough’
But rappers ain't mean enough?
Enough lashes like I ain't seen enough
On the real, this is like the neo-Emmitt Till
Whistling, get yo fuckin' ass killed
Lets keep this shit real!
Now who the realest
Everybody feel this
And everyday of my life, people try to tell me that I hate the whites
Cause I said what's right
I go to sleep and deal wit it every night
And wake up every morning
And walk to the liquor store or coffee store shop on the Mersa whats worser?
Its no verse that would reverse the-
In print or in cursive
They curse the name, or maybe call me Kane
Let's have a ‘toast for the douche bags’
Black people wanna talk about me on blogs
Cause I like clothes like, 'look at this fag'
Thats what I have to deal wit real shit
Yall dont even understand, what it take to be a real man
A black man interested in art, speaking from the heart and playin’ my part
And all this illuminati talk, like my first hit single wasn't ‘Jesus Walks’
For many years, these ain't rhymes these is muthaf-cking tears
They playin’ wit niggas careers
Felt like I’m the only real nigga here
From my last breath
They kicked me out the awards and my nigga Diddy left
Then they even sent Beyoncé up to give the award back
Didn’t even know I afford that
And she rode the wave as I rode the slave
As I felt like a slave as they try to put my shit up in the grave
Nigga behave, nigga behave
Be the first one
I bet ya no one else would ever say nuttin’ and stay frontin’
And get up and just perform, shit is enormous
Shout out to Steve Stout, you know what this shit ’bout
My whole family, now I’m scared of Grammy’s
Cause everybody know that Dark Fantasy was the highest rated album in history
So I just avoided it, not to be exploited, not to be recorded
'Cause I cannot afford it, I cannot afford more shit to be impor-ted
Uh, it’s too real for these niggas, you feel for these niggas
How I feel to be a black man, you say something wrong, nobody understand
Money, power, black, opinion, pick two, they would kill ya

No matter what goes on
They may not agree, they may not understand
But God got a plan, to put the mic in my hand
And his hand and that hand
And ideas, and all of theres
And the end, everybody up in here, in this atmosphere
So make it clear, live long and prosper
Much success, even if you wish me the opposite
To quote Nas,
 I stay on my job
Try to pray to keep my heart from going harm
And I ain't perfect, you know that from old me
My life is real even when I’m in the movies
I’m on the ave, I’m in the cave
I buried my Grandmother on Thursday, two weeks ago
My life is real, as it ever been
To all my friends and even foes
Each and every one of those, let em know
I shine a globe, even in the dark, stay smart
Stay sharp, as a harp played by a musician in this position
Feel blessed to make the whole World listen
And just glisten without even trying
Even when I die, I won't stay dead
And its straight off the head, and its straight out the lungs
Looking fly, fresh, old man, so young
And I’m straight from the slums
And never been above so the ba-bum-ba-bum-bum-pum-pum…
This thing ups, let us all give some
Number one yo, I’m number none, no comparision
And make the whole world aware of it
Brooklyn in the building we take care of it
Peace out to all the Sagittarius
And happy birthday Pisces and Aries too
And this go out to all area crew
And if you come from the seven-eighteen then you just like me
From the present, and the past and the future and beyond

Kanye that nigga with heavy dough
Roll dro and a chevy low
Told a long time ago you can't fuck every ho
Whether in Jamaica or Cancun, Mexico
Baby don't be scurred, shake that ass like Mystikal
We got physical now she calling and beeping
Call when I'm sleepin, call my girl claimin we creepin
Bitch you nuts, look I only fucked you once
How you gone get the message, I ain't called you in months
Acting like Super Dave with them dumb ass stunts
Talking bout girls I could get her whatever she want (Whatever I want)
I'm like girls like you be wanted for warrants
Stalking of course, alone on the phone disguising your voice
Got your girls asking for Kay on the three way
Talking bout (You can't call a bitch on her BDay?)
Hmm, Tanisha its over with stop playin
Nah nah it's over. (So what you saying?)
Look you gotta bounce. (I don't wanna fuck with you)

I'm never letting go
Never letting go

I'm crazy about you
(No you just crazy)

You believe this ho, pop up everywhere I go
Pop up at the show, pop up at the grocery store
Pop up in my kitchen like, ""Oh you wash dishes here?""
Pop up in my bathroom, ""Oh you take pisses here?""
Listen here we gone need some distance here
(Where I'm gone go?) I don't care, just disappear
You ain't my main bitch not even my main squeeze
Anyway, how the fuck you get a set of keys?
First she used them on my crib, then she used them on my whip
And wrote on the side, ""Kanye you ain't shit""
You believe this bitch? Man, did you see this shit!?
Did she just knock my windows out on my Escalade? (Ha yeah nigga!)
That's a twelve fuckin' hundred dollar estimate
She must've took off all yesterday just to hate
Restraining orders ain't stopping her
She the reason caller I.D. so popular
Across the street now with some fuckin binoculars
Screaming at the top of her lungs, ""I'm never letting go!""


Had enough of the stalker shit got to put her in line
Count back from ten when I got to nine I grabbed mine
Before I gotta do what I gotta do after blue she lying
Like ""Nigga you put your hands on me for the last time""
Tried to get you over your uncles to come and jump me
Take my cash and punk me
With my ass and trump me
I stump them fuckin chunkies
Just look at yo niece
She beat her own ass and called the police
(Pregnant with his baby yeah he still getting rough with me!)
And to my crib scuff me up and put the cuffs on me
My momma dropped that five hundo and got me out of custody
Girl left a note on my door (Nigga don't ever fuck with me)
And all the time I got to thinkin that I'm the man
Hottest nigga on the block and shit I got a fan
I'm like a swole nigga thought that he could lift the van
Somebody please come and take this bitch up off my hands!
You don't understand, man

Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks

You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend
 All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
 Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room
There's only one bedroom that I call my lair
We was V.I.P
Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend
 Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
 Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

Kanye West & Taylor Swift’s ‘Famous’ Lyric Phone Conversation,UnKnown,2016.0,"2016, Edited Version
Kanye:
 OK, dope. You still got the Nashville number?
Taylor:
 I still have the Nashville area code but I had to change it
Kanye:
 
For all my south side niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.
Taylor:
 
I'm, like, this close to overexposure.
Kanye:
 Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.
Taylor:
 I know! I mean it's like a compliment kind of.
Kanye:
 What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.
Taylor:
 That's sweet.
Kanye:
 I want things that make you feel good. I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.
Taylor:
 Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way.
Taylor:
 And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice!
Kanye:
 Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.
Taylor:
 Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!
Taylor:
 …things without like even asking or seeing if I'd be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.
Taylor:
 I'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.
Taylor:
 And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and it's the most Instagram likes I've ever gotten.
Kanye:
 
Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know.
Taylor:
 Yea. I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, that's a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…
Taylor:
 You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor:
 It doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor:
 … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, I'm always gonna respect you.
Taylor:
 And I'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.
Kanye:
 Thank you too.
Taylor:
 And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.
Taylor:
 You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.
Taylor:
 …awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! It's more provocative to say, Might still have sex.
Taylor:
 …it's not. 
It doesn't matter to me. there's not one
that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't.
2020 Leak
Kanye:
 —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.
Taylor:
 What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.
Kanye:
 The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.
Taylor:
 What does it say? 
Kanye:
 It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?
Taylor:
 Yeah…
Kanye:
 Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.
Taylor:
 Well, is it gonna be mean?
Kanye:
 No, I don’t think it’s mean.
Taylor:
 Okay, then let me hear it.
Kanye:
 Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?
Taylor:
 Okay.
Kanye:
 
So it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” 
Taylor:
  That’s not mean.
Kanye:
 Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”
Taylor:
 Oh my . I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. 
I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not.
 Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.
Kanye:
 Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.
Taylor:
 You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?
Kanye:
 Yeah.
Taylor:
 
I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.
Kanye:
 Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.
Taylor:
 I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of .
Kanye:
 I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. 
She was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”
Taylor:
 That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…
Kanye:
 Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—
Taylor:
 That’s sweet.
Kanye:
 —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He’s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.”
Taylor:
 Why are people saying you’re bullying Nike?
Kanye:
 Because on “Facts” I said like, “Yeezy, Nike out here bad, they can’t give shit away.”
Taylor:
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that’s just what you do though.
Kanye:

Speech at Harvard Graduate School of Design,UnKnown,2013.0,"So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn’t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!
But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.
If I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.
And I know that there’s more creativity to happen. And I know that there’s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there’s people in offices that stop the creative people, and (who) are intimidated by actual good ideas.
I believe that utopia is actually possible—but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I’m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys’ willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation.
I’m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it—um, I’m a bit self conscious because I’m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It’s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that. And that’s basically all I have to say so thank you very much.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-speech-at-harvard-graduate-school-of-design-annotated

On the 2009 VMAs,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016,"I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song.
 For the times that I've, like, defended myself...  
I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month!
 
When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days
. 
I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying.
 
Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé.
 
As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it.
 
Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns.
 
Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit!
 
I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit.
 
My mother died because of this shit.
 
Fuck MTV.
It ain't no love. 
What the fuck was Pink performing?
 
Don't nobody know that song
. 
Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the fuck Pink perform twice, and I didn't even get asked to perform
 
""Heartless.""
 
""Heartless"" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter!
 
I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink!
 They put me in a fuckin' room and .

 Eminem won Best Video! Rap Video! Yo, when he won that shit, I was so happy. I was so happy I . I said, ""Nigga, I'm gon' do this until y'all put a bullet in my head. I'm runnin' up to y'all, put a..."" .",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-the-2009-vmas-annotated

As I replay our conversations, pray that everything fell in place
Like a mirror lookin' back at me, sayin' you're the only one
Makin' me feel I could survive, so glad to be alive
Nowhere to run, I got a song to sing
Messed up inside and it's been raining all day

Since you went away, Southside serenade
Since you went away, Southside serenade

Through the Wire (Still Standing),Get Well Soon...,2003.0,"Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?
Can they, Hop?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
(I spit it through the wire, man)
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
(There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)
For a chance at loving you (Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man)
I'd take it all the way
(It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2pac died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
(I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you
(And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
All they heard was I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all (""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"")
Through the fire (""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-through-the-wire-still-standing-lyrics

Umm, When I had my accident I found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death,
If you had the opportunity to play this game of life
you need to arpeeeciate every moment
a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until it's passed


And then, you got to tell those Al Bundy stories ""You remember when I ?""
But, Right now is my time and my moment thanks to the fans, thanks to the accident, thanks to god, thanks to Roc-A-Fella, Jay-Z, Dame Dash, G, my mother, Rhymefest everyone that's helped me
And I plan to celebrate, I plan to celebrate and scream and pop champagne every chance I get becasue i'm at the grammys baby!

I know everybody's asking the question, they wanted know ""I know he's going to wild out, I know he's going to do something crazy""

Someone gonna be forging it

Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
Now I get the order
Thumbing thumbing through my wallet
Automatic toilet, now that's the shit
Popping off with the orbit, I got ya bitch
Let it go

God dammit I need you now
God dammit I need you now
God damn
And if you're out in the crowd
God dammit I need you now

Don't you play no

Let me fix my neck, chain on
Let me fix the check, games on
Let me thump a thump game on
And ain't nobody playing with him no
Summertime rain with him no
They all layin' with him now
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
No one wanna pray with him no
Want it done bathe in it now
Wanna get a raise with him now

For you lil' niggas I'm way advanced
And I don't write rhymes, I write tattoos
And when I die they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch that's a bad move
Bitch get out the way
Someone gonna get out today
And I know I was gone for a minute
But need to get out today
Now let us get this money
Sell it for  if I want to

Don't you play with you

Don't play boy
Someone  what you made boy
Hoppin in the mansion
Waking around with a robe on
I could have started play boy

I did this beat in '96 and ah...

Is it the because my beats the nicest?
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices (""One billion dollars..."")
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold 'cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul, sold twelve times gold
That's six-plat, man, that's a sick plaque (Do the math)
Man, don't forget that, that at the top is where you feel the loneliness
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear, I feel the phoniest
'Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
'Cause everybody want your spot—No I.D. told me this
Oh, I seen homies get sheisty on me quick
Woooooo! Just imagine if I only spit
But I do beats, too, that's the American dream
Stack to make sure my shawties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments
Got niggas sayin', ""There's the Kennedys!""
But oh, yes, it's the Westses
Brand new Roc-A-Fella, most fresh-to-death is...
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie LA (Okay, yeah, ugh)
That keep my shoe game early like the grave shift (Uh-huh)
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship (Woo!)
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics (Look)
Air Force, check! Rolex, check!
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the check? (Fifty thousand)

Last 9/11, I was poor on the Ave
'Til I pluraled my math, now it's Porsche 911
And I'm floorin' the gas, got a lot of problems
Money's one that I not have
Date ballplayers' wives, that divorced and got half, shiiiiiit (Oooh! Haha)
I figure they deserve somethin' for all them hours
And that be the realest shit that I never wrote
(Really spoke something on that shit)
Only book I ever read I could have wrote—48 Laws Of Power (What!)
Me, Gee and Hop, uh-huh, the game's ours (What!)
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain
Than my real one, 'cause on the real, son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children, feel him? (True)
Prolly not though, unless you got dough, you know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Regina, ""You ain't been in a Medina"" (Quit lying)
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena (Uh-huh)
Yeah, y'all the invisible ho, you ain't never seen her
Mhm, she must stay around your grandma crib
Right next door to where the in-laws live
I brought a man from the fifth floor all in y'all crib

All I do is sit in the studio and make real, real shit. And that's it. That's motherfucking it, that's motherfucking it

It ain't about me humanizing myself. At what point did I become so inhuman where I had to turn myself back? Or maybe I was demonized, maybe I was treated inhumane in that type of situation.

I'm trying to make some music that inspires people to be the best they can be -- And I don't want nobody to ask nothing else of me! Don't ask nothing else of me. Motherfuckers chasing you down about to make you crash into shit, and all they want you to make is a nigga to laugh and shit. Hell no I ain't doing no 'SNL' skits, this is my goddamn life, and this ain't no motherfucking joke. That's it, stop that shit",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-being-a-celebrity-lyrics
On Business People and Corporations,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2013.0,"How y'all feelin' tonight? Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu type important performance, let me just say that right quick. I love the energy in this city - this is one of my all-time towns y'all know I stay out here. But I came here for the creativity more than anything, because creativity fuels everything
I hate business people. People get on the phone with me and tell me ya know like, 'What kind of business can you do, though? What type of business are you doing? What's the numbers? How much did you sell? What's the radio spins? How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit (3x)
I know it's for more than to just get rich
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Since when was making art about getting rich?
And I know it's easy for me to say cause
Having money's not anything and not having it is
Remind me again why we in this shit
Remind me again why the Grammys couldn't suck my dick
Remind me again who's the original Superfly -
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fuckin' with that ""Suit and Tie.""
Remind me again
Remind me again why we in this shit -
Every nigga tryin' get rich
Every rapper tryin' get rich
And every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else... bitch
Remind me why we in this shit -
And why the Grammys can suck my dick, suck my big, black dick
And every motherfuckin' sponsor, shit
They try to put their logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet-and-greet, and you gotta meet the execs and their daughter
And they'll show you what they just bought her
Remind again why we in this shit -
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit. (x5)
They say either you comin' on too strong in this shit -
They always talkin' 'bout what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING, DICK
I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING DICK!
Remind me why we in this shit -
I lost my motherfuckin' mama
So I could give a fuck about your comments
I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
BUT I'MMA LIVE MY LIFE MY WAY!
Remind me why we in this shit? Please? can I sell a drink for you please?
So you can help me put on a better show, Please? Corporations?
Can you please support me? I swear I'm a nice nigga now. I swear I'll put the pink polo back on. I swear to you. Please. Just for three million dollars. I need it so bad. I need a new pool in my back yard. So I tell all my fans that your shit is cool. And if they believe in me they should also believe in you. Did you get the check yet? I have to call a business manager - did the corporations send the check yet? What's my public rating right now? Are people liking me again? Enough to get money from the corporations - is it OK now? They forgot about the whole Beyonce thing right? Okay cool. Is it OK now?
Remind me why we in this shit -
Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart, and I live and I die by
Everything that I say and everything that I do
And everything that I make is what I believe to be true
And if that shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense
I don't give a fuck - cause that was my stream of conscience
And that's the way I felt at that time
And feelings was the only facts
And Racism and materialism is killing blacks
And one more thing, if I can ask -
One more thing if I can ask -
Cause in this life our life just moves too fast
And time is something you will never get back
What's your quality of life?
What's your quality of life?
And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight
I hope you have a good time tonight...
LONDON! It's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight - an inspiration, not the lead instrument I'm the lead instrument. Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen... and Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume. But I just feel sometimes like there is no good ideas and no real ideas and nothing sincere left. And everything's been so homogenized. And it's all Big Business, and there's no creativity. When really we have the ability to have a union Utopia if we just help each other, if we just use our resources and stop trying to compete against each other and
Beat each other and
Eat each other
And maybe come together and try to teach each other and
Reach each other and
Maybe try to come together and love each other
Love each other and
Love one another, man
The way you love your mother, man
The way you should love her, man
Y'already understand
Cause this is our shit
And this is our clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than MY MOTHERFUCKIN' CLIQUE!",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-business-people-and-corporations-lyrics

Ayo dog
Nicky my dog
And this is for sure
So I'm not going to break you down
Ask Christina Millian know what we did on tour
Stays on tour, and i'll tell you right now
And I like Indian girls, but I won't hurry
Last time we boned, you had the bedroom smelling like curry

Come on boss
You were suppose to be the Pimp and Prince
I've seen you in Friday after next
And I haven't seen you since

Look it's hard for me to say shit
Cause I don't know about that gay shit
But I see you do, looking like Tiger Woods
Like lost in the hood
Looking like Bryant Gumbel
And expect me to be humble
Every time I flip a fold your goin to crumble
With them phony ass pony's
Bitch read the news
Why you always try running in the back and grab all the free shoes
So Why don't you buy somethin' ?
Why don't you try somethin' ?
Stop lying, stop fronting
Y'all niggas don't know about nothing

I could rip all of yall
In a line
With every rhyme
Yall know Kanye, is like the greatest all time
'Cause I do the Grammys, and comeback with my family
Rippin' you muthafuckers
With the mic that you hand me
You all don't understand me dawg
You still pushing camrys

Half Price,I’m Good,2002,"(First of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(You got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(What else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (Know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you

You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
All the girls sayin' that his hair look Indian
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' Kim (Yes I would)
We gon' roll this weed
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
I'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone
Now she like a lot of clothes, I like to see her out of 'em
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
Don't give Kanye a chance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Y'all talkin' business, I'm peepin' her thighs
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and ""Do she need that beat tracked again?""

'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on 
Chyna Doll
, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, ""Baby, that may be fake""
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a ménage with Lazy K
And Lady May, maybe, hey?
You're lookin' all thick and sweet
You need a nigga that can give you dick and beats
So go and get Angie and tell her

'Cause I came back for you
To show you that I'm workin' with a little somethin'
And we get the session pumpin'
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price

Got a two for head sale
Send, send headshots first though
Will you beat tapes for who? Oh, Trina?
Oh, I'm right there, I'm right there
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
Yo yo, she said she want her ass look gushy wet
I told her all I need is my back end check
I told her to—

1996 Fat Beats Freestyle,UnKnown,1996.0,"Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?

I had that little ass Nissan at your crib showin' up
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist, we Irish Rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's
But that's that last year purse like it's still too cheap
Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
'Cause five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Rob and G. Dep
Then I'mma take you to the house like Trick and Trina

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
""So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends""

Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
I give you words spit with flames
Stay to myself and let nerves mix with lames
Connoisseur of Kama Sutra, do somethin' absurd with your dame
I used to love this girl who loved shoppin' and smokin' herb
But my job was to hustle 'dro
Now an artist of the spoken word, I just hustle flow
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
I would love for you and your friends to get with me and my friends
But the problemo is your attitude be on the stank side
And I no longer like you
Fuck it, now you can't ride but ooh, wouldn't you like to


Deep as the ocean is the motion of life
Thought you would have been the sister I chose for my wife
Not knowin' you was trife
Stiflin' a nigga's growth
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Watch soaps on the couch, take shit and smoke
I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
You ain't gon' let me school ya, at least let me tutor
The sex is good, but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper
I look through the mirror and see my reflection
It ain't in your direction so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways goin' Wild West like Kanye
Wherever I lay my kufi is my home, goddamnit I'm grown
Broke broad I'mma leave your ass alone
You still wanna ride though

Would you like to ride shotgun in the Escalade
""So why don't you and your friends get with me and my friends""

I have my condoms in the stove cause she won't look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure its safe to pull a grocery ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor isle
She said ""I hope its not too ghetto""
Rocked all gold force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin wild
Like last week I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, 16
Now the car only 1 years old, oh
Man but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case I better take my ass home

But the problem is..

We can't even sit and talk no more, without you arguing
Girl you must be out of your mind, no no no
You're the one who started it

Hold up, wait a second man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second hand
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses 'bout my Porsches
Condos in front of the golf courses
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake Roley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way the censorship'll go off, you know me
I ain't call you, you wanna know why?
Im in Noha, Hon aloha, pushin jet skis so I
Couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun? Stays down there
What's happenin here? Made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat, why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this 
apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
But the problem is..


Man, boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after 2 or 3 or 4
I ain't messin with them girls no more
It's weak
, the benz coupe is so sweet
When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, ""You must love that car more than me
And nigga I was with you before the cheese
So you need to work on your pri-or-ities
If she went with Fabolous I bet that she would be

On Dreaming and Success,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2013.0,"How many of you people came here with someone you love tonight. 
If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonight
Tonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I don't want to say nothing politically incorrect.  A very safe musician. I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. 
CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN?
 Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most
You know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. . It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?
I had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney.
 
I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison
. 
I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream
. 
And I'm not afraid to dream out loud.
 You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true
Cause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low.  I find , cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!
I ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so  confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering
Cause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. 
So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!
 I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming
I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 
2Pac
. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool. Following what you want to tonight, and you gotta an opportunity in the world
How many people are under 20 tonight? How many people are under 30 tonight? Under 40, under 50, under 60, GOD DAMMIT YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ARE LIVING, YOU ARE BREATHING, SO  YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS WORLD!!!",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-dreaming-and-success-lyrics

Drink it out the bottle then I poured it on her D-cups (haan)
Ball so hard, went D1
Jumped over the Jumpman, just stumped the tree stump (woo)
Breakfast at the SOHO, give her FOMO like a mofo

Dreams Come True,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

Man I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that ver-say-see
Man I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, nigga you ain't up on this
That's why I'm iced out, medallion heavy on the wrist
My niggas servin' the checks like the first and fifth-teenth
So insecurr, cut that coke 'til it's so unpure
We all need furs by December the third
Cause you heard, Chicago winters is extra burr
Bricks, nicks, nigga so herb
Hustlin' to the whole world, never sober
Seats in the Rover, soft as sofurrs
Ballin so hurr 'till I need a chauffeur

You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

Man I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy shorty a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby-daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know

It may seems we living the nigga's American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
As any means to get that green
Cause society done turned us all into fiends
For the road to riches and diamond rings
And what about the teens moms hearts that broke?
Niggas got killed over Starter coats
But I can feel why the shorties be mad as shit
Without the Jordans, he feelin' inadequate
He be feelin' so insecure
Dawg, why that nigga got it? Man life unfair
He be feelin' like fuck the world and furthermore
Feelin' like it's worth
Killin' a person for
But when that pain's gone, it just hurts some more
It seems the sun never shine, that we searchin' for

You might think you do
But you don't know
It's like a dream come true
But you don't know
You might think you do

I heard the Chinese buyin' Africa quicker than we would get it
And if you tell somebody you goin' to Africa
Somebody would laugh at ya
Like the top off it, and spend it at the Gucci store
Hold on more, woah, woah
Don't tell me 'bout them woke facts (Woke fact)
Them just sound like broke facts (Broke facts)
I don't know who the fuck told you that (Told you that)
I don't know who the fuck sold you back (Told you that)
Buy your freedom 'fore they sell you back (Sell you back)
Why we need 'em? They just sold you crack (Sold you crack)
So let's done 'em, where the soldiers at? (Soldiers at)
Most of them ain't running, most of them want that bump (Ooh)
Face the gun in the sun, we been brainwashed (Ooh)
Fuck that, we in our own holocaust (Ooh)
It ain't never ended, it all depends (Ooh)
The Jews, least they said, never again

Part of my blessings blending in with my soul
Do what I feel and I live what I say so
Oh, been drive a little million miles on this roads

Don't go creepin' if ya got a iPhone
She tracked ya location and ya ass wasn't home

Told that nigga get from and from my car
My Yeezy's on the gas
And last thing I need is involuntary manslaughter
'Cause I ain't finna let no lame nigga raise my daughter
Stop asking me that dumb shit; do you have a Samsung charger?
You see me spending that Gualla
We stay spending that Gualla 'til you love me
Thirsty bitch, keep sippin' that water 'till you love me
Do you love me?
I got caught up with the strippers, I got caught up in the fame
Caught up on MediaTakeOut
Don't know how much more I could take
I got caught up in the pictures, they blurry enough I could fake
I can tell my girl it wasn't me, I was in a meeting with Jay

But today, I don't have any plans
Rap God in a minivan
Usher say I got it bad, yo, really bad
Does anybody have any 'Xans?

'Cause you don't know these rich-nigga problems
You niggas got bitch-nigga problems
Too many hoes on my dick; yeah, I got big dick nigga problems
If she hack my phone, that's dick pic nigga problems
That's when she ask, ""Who the fuck is Tonya?""
Nigga, you must be fucking Tonya

Sometimes I make 'em hate me just to prove I can make 'em love me again
I could make you love me again
I'll make y'all love me
I feel like a new artist up in this bitch
Like I'm really starving up in this bitch
If you don't wanna hear my mouth, don't get me started up in this bitch
Every time I throw up my diamond, see it's flawless up in this bitch
Screaming south-southside, goin' retarded up in this bitch
See T-Raww up in this bitch
Yeah, see Yeezus back on his shit
They say damn Ye, please come back

You see love and hate's a similar emotion
Opposite of love is the difference
That's when motherfuckers don't care about you no more
I'd rather be hated and loved than be not cared about
Rrrrra, rrrrrrra, get these motherfuckers out
See I immediately took the media
See I immediately took the media
And made it what it mean to me
I control this shit, I control the puppet strings
I am in charge of the narrative
So don't ever compare this shit
As I air this shit out, a modern day Ali
For anybody that wanna try me, see
All I ever wanted to do was take the whole time on TV and give an eleven-minute speech
They wish I would perform for these niggas
Dance. nigga. dance, dance, nigga, dance, dance, nigga, dance
I been dancing too long and y'all motherfuckers money been getting too strong
If I hear another motherfucker I put on made a million dollars a day (uh, yeah, yeah)

I Met Oprah,Freshmen Adjustment Vol. 2,2013,"This my last motherfuckin' freestyle dog
If you don't let me go first this time man, you'll have to wait 'til the album come out Monday
I'm tired man I'm sick and tired
I'm just a player player
Plus it's an exclusive KanyeToThe beat? C'mon man
Fuck around throw this on your instrumental shit too
This is what I'mma have to say

Niggas old as hell, trying to get they rapping on
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
I'm in the club, posted up, ""Guess Who's Back"" is on
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world, we all got your girl
Caught your girl, never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans, I'm going after MCs
Show 'em that this rap game made for me
Made for us, they bite and they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
Dog, I had to eat, I sold beats from my album
Now I got heat, I hold beats for my album
February 18th, reach for my album
Niggas forcing me to keep the heater
Black strap, white handle, I got Jungle Fever
Black Benz, white truck, and one 2-seater
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
It feel like the whole hood try to get a Jimmy Jones makeover
I got the hood on my shoulder, city on my back
They like ""Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back!""
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins
Niggas popping out the woodworks, talking about ""you owe me""
Mama, I'm famous, niggas hate me that don't know me

Yo, I know you all suprised and shit when you see me on MTV
But keep your eyes glued to...I don't know what channel that is out here
In Chicago that's Channel 7, ABC
You might fuck around see me on Oprah Winfrey or something
Matter of fact, true story, true story
Last week...I got a little cold right now, true story, though
I'm on 40th and like 5th or something
I see an SUV and the window rolled down and shit!
And this black lady from Chicago, she like
""Yo, um, I just bought one of these in black.""
You know I just got the G5 or whatever
She like, ""I just got one of these in black
How does it drive?""
I'm like, ""it drive more like a truck than my last one.""
I'm like, ""yo, but I'm from Chicago, too. I wanna be on your show!""
She said ""yo, well, oh, ok, well, who are you?""
And I told her, ""I'm Kanye West, a rapper.""",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-i-met-oprah-lyrics

On The College Dropout’s 10-Year Anniversary,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2014.0,"Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout
I say ""finally"" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
To not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear
I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice
Gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come
I am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years
I wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of
Ten years later I am still the same kid from Chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door
The doors may be heavier, but I promise you WE WILL BREAK THEM",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-the-college-dropouts-10-year-anniversary-lyrics

2004 Tim Westwood Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I told her to drive over after dude crib
Bring a couple new friends
Them last girls was too thick
How you expect me to hit?
You wanna watch Clueless
I wanna watch Foolish
Excuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness
But if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness
I heard the best head come from girls that is toothless
Yeah my game ruthless, yeah my car roofless
Spit that ""Through The Wire"" over Chaka Khan, ruthless
She said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson
That bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson
Nah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action
I'm just gon' play this ""Slow Jamz,"" holla at your man

Old school like Melle Mel
Or we could go to the D where Drelle Drel
Or DC, PG, or ATL
Back in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Father penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, ""Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold""
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicagoan 'til Chicago wins
'Til we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away
I have to say, we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get your tall ass out that C-Class coupe
You see the whiskey, had them girls feelin' frisky
You was with me, she said, ""Who's your sensei?""
And even if they wanna get busy
And freaky like Missy and roll some weed up
You'll roll 3 blunts and fuck up 3 blunts
Mothafucka you would fuck up a free lunch
Dawg, keep it right thurr like Chingy
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls ask me, ""No habla ingles""
And everybody wanna run to me for their sin-glay
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg if I was you I'd kill myself
That Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, that's straight up nigga
She claimed she ain't hear me on ""The Bounce"" with Jigga
She claimed she ain't see me on the basement with Tigga
Them both my niggas, I suppose
I might have been doin' a lil' frontin' for the hoes
When I flip flows, I rip shows
And your girlfriends, can I hit those?
I don't know if it's me, or do them Uggs
Got girl's feets lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with her name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
Cause umm... I'm tryna make it to your anus
See that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John's name
Niggas tryna figure out since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year: me or LeBron James?
They said, ""Woah don't get caught up in the hype""
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend moeny 'til you're broke, my nigga, live your life
Cause I'm livin' international, nigga, the American dream
All my dawgs is livin' vicariously through me
If I get head from Drene, that's one for the team
Cause 702, that's one for the crew
My dawg Hip-Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Cause like a Brinks truck, they know there's money inside

I'ma take a little intermission
I'ma let y'all just talk about how good I rap for a minute and I'ma come back

So I dropped out of school cause I'm tryna eff the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit her with this maneuver, he just couldn't recuper'
I'm tryna stab one like Jack The Ripper
I'm tryna stab two like Jack The Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the skreets, he gon' want him some skrippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't even be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em cloudin' up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' jean
4 Gs in the Rocawear jeans
This top red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see this? These are the sweetest Adidas
We fire, y'all retire
All ugly people, please be quiet
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard ""Just to Get By"" and I was re-hired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
Laughs I do though...",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-2004-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics

I'm not comin' too soon, I just got it to move

Take one leg on the stomach, bite the stomach
Stretch one leg down, put the other one, touch your knees

Wake your ass, take about another hour of dick
I know foul stuff, don't believe me, karma coming quick
Know they stuntin' now, and we got 'em sellin' out the flick
And she only think steady, tell that bitch to come equipped

Anything,The Graduate,2007,"I mean wow. You know? Man

Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Lookin' at my closet wondering if it's all about clothes
Look right next to me, wondering if it's all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow, I say ""I know""
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like ""Hey, you might like this""
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, ""Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle""

Time, they say (true story, )
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
Don't believe
That you can't achieve
Whatever you're after
You can't be swayed
By the simple minds
That wanna hold you down
And in His time
The pain you carry
Will be left far behind

If you listen to the sermons
And ask the Lord for guidance
You will see the many blessings (blessings you have received)
When you give Him all the glory (glory)
Gonna talk to, don't ignore thee (ignore thee)
Listen to all the stories
Meant to sing Your name

Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

You try to please everyone
Time to live your life
Release those old illusions
Stop wasting time and
Start embracing
His light and let it shine

(Don't you listen) when they say
(You won't make it) oh it ain't no way
(Through the madness) never stop believing in yourself
In the morning you'll see
All the answers that free
You from chains that would seem
To keep you standing still

Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your the child of The King
And you can do anything

I got an angel on my shoulder and I know he been warning me
To stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be
Cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be
But a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave
And stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave
But the women be callin' me
The liquor be callin' me
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
If he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
But I still be in the hood so the pressure is there
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to Get Out My Dreams

Don't let no one stand in your light
Change the way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Can tell you what your worth
Stand up, your a child of The King
And I can do anything

Oh yes I can
Yes I can
I can do all things 
Nobody on this earth can tell you what you're worth
You're a child of The King
Never stop believing in yourself
The way you feel inside
Nobody on this earth
Stand up, stand up
And you can do anything

Break the Simulation (Philosophy Book),UnKnown,UnKnown,"April 15th, 2018
Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness. often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends.

As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency. You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas.
distraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything.
everything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.
trend is always late
April 18th, 2018
when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.
You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.
I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.
in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to ""the simulation"".  Parents are our first acting coaches.
me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.
Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.
too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️ I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like ""this person stole this from me"" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂 let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.
don't trade your authenticity for approval
truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth
if you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.

we need to Aman Giri the world
people are celebrating real ideas and vibe. Not just hype
all you have to be is yourself
I don’t believe in horizontal hierarchy. If you build a ladder too high it’s actually most dangerous for the people at the top.
images are limitless and words aren't. Words are defined
sharing is community holding information is capitalism
iterations of ideas are how culture evolves.
everything is so planned these days. People appreciate spontaneity and honesty.
strive for universal consciousness not segregated consciousness
style is genderless

I love the way Candace Owens thinks. only free thinkers
I don't subscribe the term and concept of God fearing.  That's a dated mentality that was used to control people. We are in the future. If God is love and love it's the opposite of fear then...🤔🤷‍♂️ to fear God makes no sense 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ live in love not in fear. be fearless. Express what you feel not what you've been programmed to think.
get past the past
The more people contribute to real time global consciousness the faster we evolve
April 22nd
question everything
the blinders are off
Demonization has metastasized. The psychological zombie effect. People demonize people and then they demonize anybody who sees anything positive in someone whose been demonized
we have freedom of speech but not freedom of thought. The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought.
Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there
We live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.
self victimization is a disease
April 23
we're evolving at warp speed
new ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses. We are on the frontier of massive change. Starting from breaking out of our mental prisons.
life is more exciting than the movies
even Prince once had an access pass
everyone should be their own biggest fan
I’ve always had a desire to do things people wouldn’t even think to do

April 25
Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.
You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.
If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary
I love Hillary too.
I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican
And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.
with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.
I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say ""I love you"" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.
When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.
no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love
fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts
decentralize
burn that excel spread sheet 🔥😂
whenever someone mentions the word ""fan"" to me it's super manipulative. It's like ""don't do or say this because of your fans""  My fans are fans of themselves.
And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️
April 26th, 2018
Though hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.
The world is our family
People usually don't agree with people who don't agree with them
if you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you
the concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.
Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do.
it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma
we are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel
spread love. Put more love into the universe.

Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long, man, we back in town

Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you ""bye""
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
In that brand new Escalade, metallic, black or beige
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiiyo my man Kanyeezy, he got something to say

Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy from the Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on ""The Champions"" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats

And if you talk about him, aiyyo I take you out
Either with the nine, or the Tec's in his mouth
And if that dime getting friendly then the orgy's at eight
But y'all niggas don't shine, so you couldn't relate

Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (You couldn't relate)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Yo, 'Quence?)
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down

'Quence was out the game, now he's back to ball
Drive you insane, drop a tat at the mall
You staring at my rose-gold way too long
But I ain't scared to ride, that's why I wear Teflon
I took her on the ave' and she expect me to trip
But I made her window shop while I bought me some kicks
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy

Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say, ""He don't look like a thug or a hood""
""But he keep them gorillas, so he still be good""
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out in N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm saying I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat

Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks

Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and then call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture

Kanye, White, Malik, Little and D
Menace, Skates to Lou and the Puffs from L.B
They know that Consequence be wearing gold and ice
Cause I got out the projects, where it's flooded with mice
Eh shorty, let me tell you 'bout the rules of my nights
It seems I always keep it moving, I don't hit nothing twice

Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down {Don't hit nothing twice}
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
So relax yourself, or we'll back you down (Kon Man Produc'!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (yeah! yeah!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down (It's the ROC!)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down

Y'all, I'm just waiting for God

I'ma wait for God
I'ma wait for God
Been too long away from God
I'll wait for God

Like water be the path, go take the path of least resistance
Don't force nothin', it's the way
Power versus force
I'ma wait for God
Been too long away from God
I'll wait for God, we'll wait

Yo, know I'm sayin'?
People try to rush things
Or manipulate, or strategize, or think they're gon' set up plays
Man makes plans, God laughs
He got good ass sense of humor, know what I'm sayin'?
I was just livin' my life
Spent all of my tour money on this, big mansion 'n' shit
Biggest house in Hidden Hills
He funny though
He gon' move the number one rapper four blocks down the street from me
You funny, God
Heheheh

Mm, I'ma wait for God
Been too long away from God
Been too long away from God
Ooh, I will wait for God

Wait, wait, wait wait wait
Only with his blessings, only
In his time and God willing
Shall it happen
Ya know, people go through pain 'n' shit
You need some time to just walk it off, it's like a sprained ankle
You can't get right to it, know what I'm sayin'?
It's like a basketball game, pain
The way we feel about things, mm, mm, mm
If someone say
We-we say, we hoopin' and stuff, you sprain your ankle
The whole team, can't come to it and say, ""I'm sorry,"" and it's just gonna feel better
Or you can't scream at it and it's just gon' feel better
You've gotta take time for that to heal
And maybe you need to stay of off it a little bit
Stay off the subject
Heh huh

I'ma wait for God
Eh-na, when it happen
Oh, I'ma wait for God

It's so funny
I was goin' to Denny's the other day
Lenny's, Denny's
And, I was, ya know, in Westwood
And I seen
A-A tall, light-skinned dude with a beard and shit
I said, ""That look like Drake, right there""
But he was like on a skateboard
I said, ""I know that ain't gon' be Drake on a skateboard""
Heheheheh, heh
I was like, ""Man, I'ma go talk to him, right now!""
So I-I pulled to turn the car around
It's- I swear he looked just like-
He definitely brought beards for light-skinned niggas back in style and shit, like, hehehe
I said on my first album, I'ma make sure light-skinned niggas never come back in style, heheheh

Oh, I'ma wait for God
Oh, I'ma wait for God
Oh, I'ma wait for God

Spent too long a summer away from God, though I
I might blast off, off into the light, oh

On Politics,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2013.0,"React how you want. Any energy you got is good energy. You know, the Confederate flag represented slavery. That’s my abstract take on what I know about it.
So I made the song “New Slaves.” So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It’s my flag now, now whatchu gonna do?

It looks cool. I like at maybe 800 images a day. You know, I’ve been working on clothing seriously for the past 11 years.
It’s colorless also. It’s super, like, hood and super white-boy-approved at the same time. And that’s really what my style’s always been, because I lived in the suburbs, where, you know, I was known as the Black kid, and I lived in the hood where I was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs.
My dad was a military brat, and he would be around white people back then when it was like, racism was really popular and people would be racist against him, and he’d get around Black people and they’d kinda discriminate against him because they’d say he acted ‘white’ or talked ‘white.’ So there are times when I’ll talk and you’ll hear some of that white--or what people call ‘white’--the suburb voice come through and it’s times you’ll hear some of that Chicago come through. I’m influenced by all those things.
I lived in China when I was in fifth grade with my mother, she’s an English professor, and she taught high-level English. And it was my hint at being a celebrity because they hadn’t seen Black people on TV, so people would stare at me all the time.

There will never be another Backstreet Boys, Not in this day and age. It’s gonna be artists like Lorde, singer songwriters, that are gonna come up. This is Instagram, this is the information highway. And I talk to these heads, you know, these older dudes that run companies, and it’s hilarious to me! I only listen to people who are younger than me! These are the only people with ideas. You cannot give me any advice! You can help me. You can support Donda. You can cut a check. But I have the ideas! No one older than me has a better idea than me because I’m the only 36 year old me! I’m the most relevant voice on the planet Earth, at age 36, post being the most hated. So don’t try to tell me anything! Help me! Help me, help other people.

We are uncomfortable. 500 kids are dying in Chicago a year. We are uncomfortable. Just because we’re being a gated community doesn’t mean that things are comfortable.
The thing is, we have the resources on this planet to have a human utopia, to have respect for each other, mankind. We have that. But we’re too concerned about getting the next Hollywood film on Netflix. We have the resources. There’s new billionaires everyday. You apply the right type of thinkers, like the Elon Musks, the people with the real ideas.
Like, politics is dead. It’s over with. These kids need some type of real truth.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-politics-annotated

Kill the feeling, right, oh and I made it rhyme

Bitch, do I look like your type?

She asked
Is that pronounced N-Y-C?
No, that's a niche

I'm still doing 120 on the freeway
She still got a prom picture in her key-chain
I told her look
This ain't high school no more
I'm tryin'a fuck being cool no more
So niggas go ball
Just to perform
Cause all these rats be talking up a storm
I know what they worn
I know what they be liking
If they hair short
Said ""They probably be dyking'""
Probably a drying
Probably you like it
I can't know what
You're probably a psychic
I know a crazy bitch by the look in her eyes
I know a cheating bitch gonna look at my guys
I know a fat bitch gonna look at them fries
Tell me on the side like
""Can I supersize?""
Got my meat in my ride
Go down while I drive
Some hoes ain't for show

I'ma little too rich to fuck this broke bitch

Kanye more important than Michael Jordan
Got this rap game locked, you could call the warden

Damn I was wrong..how could I stoop so low?
Pull up in a four door volvo
Dropped the top and swooped yo hoe
Woah..oh no

No bitch with a fade in my Escalade
No sluts with a gut in my Beamer truck

She was like 37-25-36
Now she 37 with 25 kids
Ya' know what I'm sayin?
Now she on the come up

You claim you got hoes, nigga, we can't tell
You claim you got dough, but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale

Politics kept me at the end of the mixtape
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight (Uh-huh)
I'm tryna do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got BIG
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
That's the poison that run through their veins
And attacks they soul and just start to tear 'em up
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut (""Where you going?"")
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing (I ain't playing with y'all niggas)
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats hisself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own (Uh-huh)
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help

Y'all bout to blow, man, we can't tell
You claim you got hoes, man, we can't tell
You niggas getting dough, dog, we can't tell

I cop Ides by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'ma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'ma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, the Flic', and Do or Die (What up!)
So first of all, who am I? (""The fuck is you?"")
My—My—My name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge, look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now, I don't know if it's me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
But I'm so live/smooth, there's nothing to prove (Ooh-OOH!)

On Voting for Trump,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016.0,"I told you. But if I would have voted, I would have voted on Trump. 
Now, there’s people that I love that did vote that voted for Hillary and I don’t love them no less because they had their opinion. I love friends that I have that voted on Hillary. My manager, Scooter Braun, voted on Hillary. One of my management team. My other manager, Izzy, I’m gonna assume voted on Hillary. Everybody said that if you voted on Trump you have to go back to like Montauk or shit. And guess what? That entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion, still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y’all. They told me, “Ye, do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that out loud.” And I just said it! I wanted to say that before the election and they told me, “Do not say that out loud. Whatever you do, do not say that.” That don’t mean that I don’t think that Black Lives Matter. That don’t mean I don’t think that I’m a believer in women’s rights. That don’t mean I don’t believe in gay marriage. That don’t mean that I don’t believe in these things because that was the guy I would have voted for.
Run the next song.
Believe that there are people here enjoying, or before I start talking at least, enjoying a Kanye West show. By a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a Kanye West show who voted for Trump?  Oh, it sound differently from before, huh? It sounds different. Why did we boo the first time on something that wasn’t, “Hey, do you like Trump?” That wasn’t what I asked. I asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided.
How that make you think, though? The fact that I just asked that undeniable question? That in most music situations you have the Democrats always since the beginning of time. The Democrats were considered to be more liberal. The Democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach. The Democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you. Democrat is like music to your ears or something. Bye. Your voices. Do you believe–what percentage of people here–and by the way, I’m not setting y’all up, I’m not setting y’all up I’ve got no time for bullshit–what I’m saying is, what percentage of people here do you think voted for Trump? Do you think it was two people here? Do you think maybe it was 100 people? Do you think maybe it was 1,000 people out of the 15,000 people here? No, I’m asking you, what do you really believe? One person. Two people. What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe? What do you really believe?
I haven’t talked about anybody’s stances on anything. I haven’t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side. That’s not what I’m talking ’bout. That’s not what I’m asking you. What I’m asking you is what you really believe. I put something that I would bet on. I bet that it might be 20 percent or maybe even 30 percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for Trump. I bet you 15 percent, 50 percent of them, would never say that at a Kanye West show because of the climate right now. And they don’t know they might think I’m like, “Oh, they voted for Trump... y’all should go ahead and….” It’s the opposite of that. People got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for. That’s the right to vote! That is our right! I did not vote. Aww, no. The Saint Pablo ticket sales are going down now. Aww no, t-shirts. “Aww nah, you just got out of jail Ye. You had to deal with the Taylor Swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some... naw, Ye don’t say shit. Just step out.” Fuck that, bro. That’s the reality.
Well, Ye, how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain’t even vote? I’m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it. I’m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way. And if no one will do it in that way I will take position in 2020 and do it myself. “Aw you ain’t gonna get it now because of what you just said.” It was proof that it didn’t matter what nobody just said! It doesn’t matter!
It might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, “Oh, this rapper” because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I’m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn’t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don’t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There’s possibilities inside of books. There’s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?
Don’t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president’s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don’t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked! Next song.
Oh shit, you threw something at me. Does anyone else wanna throw something at me? But, you know what, I got the power to get that guy kicked out, or whatever, roughed up. No. Stay here. What do you believe? That’s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That’s a woman right there saying, “I love you,” after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump’s campaign. That’s not supposed to happen, right? No! That’s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we’re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There’s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.
I don’t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I’m not saying that, “Aw man, that just mean that anybody can win.” That’s not what I’m saying when I say 2020. I’ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It’s that, “Oh, I don’t fuck with your principles so now I’m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.” Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.
Man, and you know what also? I’m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that’s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I’m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It’d be like white people that’s racist running around saying “niggas” now. If people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves, bro. This is what I’m saying. It’s already the beginning of change. Sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen. Sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-voting-for-trump-annotated

Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts.  The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.
You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.
If your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary
I love Hillary too.
I love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be.
Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican
And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.
with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.
I said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say ""I love you"" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.
When my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.
no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love
fear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts

whenever someone mentions the word ""fan"" to me it's super manipulative. It's like ""don't do or say this because of your fans""  My fans are fans of themselves.
And any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic 🎤Yeezy shrug 🤷‍♂️

let's move in love not fear

Baby’s Coming,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
You know what I'm saying
I'm saying I put my personality into it

These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out ""money ain't a thing""
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
Calling you later saying what she crying about
Put that bitch on now what she lying about
Talking about how she late and how she eat a lot
See she eat a lot cause she smoke weed a lot
Why all the bogus hoes want to front on k
Why the fine hoes can't have one on the way
I prolly tell her to keep it, it'll be our little secret
Boniquan now my shorty looking fine: Puerto Rican
As long as she don't flip it tell her man that we creepin'
What we doin' is all day
When I hang up it ain't called hate its called wait
When you get popped don't call me call Clay
That's your man ain't it
That's the plan ain't it
When she told me it was mine I damn near fainted

Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
Shit I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

Now these hoes run gun I ain't finna say nothing
She tried to pop my pockets before I even got paid
Don't trip, this bitch was a whip
You could learn something from her but you might get burned from her
We smoked a couple of dimes I hit it a couple of times
Now she say she pregnant and its mine
I'm thinking she was lying by the looks on her face
But she started paging me like every single day
She said her man going away the judge gave him three
Must've thought she was gon' make a fool out of me
To bail this nigga out all she need was a G
Now she must've came to me so I had to change the beat
I said look hoe you must be crazy off that dope
That's when I snatched the rope then I kicked her on the floor
And all that shit I bought you bitch I want it back
You lied to me return of the Mac

Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

All y'all niggas is new with it
I paid my dues with it
Gave hoes abortion loot they bought shoes with it
Say they pregnant who's is it
Tell 'em you did it
Forcing these niggas out of abortion cheese
Paid a couple of hundred now or later more than G's
 have a kid by a lame ass broad
I knocked up this girl I barely liked cause she bugged me
She ain't even cute, our baby prolly by ugly
And I ain't happen to have that baby and your stomach doing 
How much it cost to get rid of it? I give you half of that
But I didn't know that she was on the pill
Needed the money for her hair and her nails
And her cell phone bill
Hoes'll get you its like getting robbed without a pistol
 come up on a nigga
 like you not the one cause she ain't got no proof
What happen nine months later when she was telling the truth

Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago
Let em put you on peep it though
I ain't even want to freak the hoe
I just snapped the first time 'bout a week ago

On Creative Frustration,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2014.0,": Fashion is obviously very important to you. You’re designing again, in fashion. Tell me, what’s the difference in how you approach fashion to how you approach music? Is it similar, is it completely different?
: Everything in the world is exactly the same.
: Alright, great. I don’t think we’re done but I think I’m going to sign off.
: Meaning like, you can do comparable people like - who would you compare Daniel Day-Lewis or Phillip Seymour Hoffman to musically, or in fashion, directing, architecturally? Who was your favorite teacher when you were growing up? It’s certain people that when - that teacher when you’re in eighth grade, that this person really cared and you knew this person cared about you as a student and gave everything they had and they were meant to do that. It’s other people that were just like getting a check or something. It’s all the same. You know, for me I give you paintings, sonic paintings. I have synesthesia; I can see sound in front of me. So, when I want to do fashion, I just want to give you sculptures. So it’s like Michelangelo; the church wanted him to paint, and he just wanted to do sculptures. So the hard – the difficult thing for me that everyone doesn’t understand, I just want to be able to use marble and make sculptures. But, due to the fact that I’m a celebrity, all these different things they’re like “no, you can’t do this, you have to do this kind of line.”
So, it’s kind of the first of its kind so that’s the reason why there’s been a lot of confusion as to why I want to do it, to why is he getting so frustrated about it. It’s like: why don’t you just do music? It’s an overall creative expression. Like I have a friend, Yves Béhar, that designed the Jawbone wristband and stuff, and the Jambox and everything. As a designer, you know, he's not in a box to only design, you know, a speaker. He can design whatever he wants and I'm like, that's the type of creative expression and freedom any creative, you know, wants.
And as, you know, get really successful at one thing you start to grow, and you're like - you feel like you can do more things, and your shoe starts to get a little bit tight, and you do everything you can to get a bigger shoe so you can walk further and run faster. And people are like now in this day and age, if you don't believe it, it's like they're like ""No, Kanye, you can't run faster. This is the limit that was made. This is the walls that Michael Jackson broke down for you, and Jay Z and Russell Simmons broke down for you. This is the end of it. So I'm in the process, 2013 all of the controversy about why - I'm in the process of breaking down walls that people will understand 10 years from now - 20 years from now.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-creative-frustration-annotated
On Obama: “I’m Past That”,UnKnown,2013.0,"“I’m not gonna mention him no more, I’m past that,” Yeezus said of the president on Philadelphia station Hot 107.9. “That’s out my thoughts. That’s lowering my priority of thinking at this point.”
“Oh, you talking about how he use to come and visit me and my mama and tell me he’s about to run for president?” Ye' replied when asked if he would ever ""break bread"" with the president and continued, “I just think that we’re pop icons, and the president likes to use that type of thing just to be down. People was fine with me being everyone’s punching bag for about five years — ‘This is the person we love to hate, so if you want to distract people from everything that’s going on … just say you hate Kanye and there’s going be 30 other people who say they hate Kanye.’ That was kind of my position in culture and he kind of used that too — ‘Oh, he’s a jackass’ — because that’s how the world felt.""
“I don’t care if someone’s the president or not,” Kanye finished. “I care about thoughts and how you helping people and what you bring to the world.”",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-obama-im-past-that-annotated

I’m a New Man,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Well the song says no one man should have all that power right?
There’s definitively been times I let
Let power, get the best of me…
And let the world take the rest of me
I look in the mirror and say
“God, is this, is this my destiny?
Is this what I’ve done
After all the years of you blessin’ me?”
Well maybe this is just a moment
A moment of you all testin’ me
To see if I can still act professionally
To keep me at bay
Like the Chesapeake
Guess it’s me
Just a ‘G
From the C.I.,
Honest… And why?
Why would you give me that Power?
Knowing I was just an artist
Knowing exactly where my heart is
And I will only work the hardest
And sometimes, put art, before being the smartest
And sometimes act retarded
Just look at what I started
And they wanted me to be dearly departed
Die, nigga die, and I had no reply
And I still looked her in the eyes
And said that I could touch the sky
And after all the drama
I wonder where I would be if I still
Had my Momma, Common
And everybody I was promising around me
You know how niggas from Chi town be, sometimes we wild
Act like a child
Get fouled
Stay in style
As of now …?
... flows through the veins of a modern day
Pharaoh. In American Apparel
Standing down the barrel of the media
For the man that face never made it in the encyclopedia
His story, His glory
…and they re-write history right in front of us - in front of us
But what happens?
When one of us is on the other side of that T.V. screen?
You know what I’m sayin’. Real niggas you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
- you know what I mean
Or at least that’s what I thought
But when they sayin’ “Hey that’s what the real nigga do, right?”
Naw not right, that’s just mean, that’s just me that’s not, right
Now how long did it take me to realize?
And open up my fucking eyes!
That this shit is just a disguise
All the fame!
And the power!
And the hour!
In the showers!
Of the diamonds!
And the jewels!
And the gold!
Everybody say you cold!
Everybody screaming at mothafucking shows
And you know what?
You wake up in the morning
And in awe you’re a real person
And worse you got the …?...
Got a little bit harder
A little bit more insignificant
You was the terrific shit
Buying expensive shit
Last year worked for Louis or Ford
Too much for me to even record
The only thing I had to do was get my heart out
The greatest blessing in the world is the fact you let me get my art out
The fact that you accepted me and didn’t neglect me
Even when I was a …?...
Even when I went to these meetings straight dolo
I had to go solo. I used to have a group
That group used to wear Adidas and
…?... and then I got stupid and left them niggas
And said I’m better than ya’ll when it was true
Now when I finally got the power man what the fuck did I do?
And I’m so sorry to ya'll, how every one of ya’ll had to fight for my name
Every one of ya’ll a year ago, that all waited for this change
Everyone who said “Kanye is that nigga, quit talkin’ names”
And all ya'll: I am the one to blame
And the people that I-I-I, let down
I want to tell you right here - right here, right now
That I’m a new man that understands why people abusing the power
*Crowd erupts drowning out the lyrics*
And make more music for the world to love!
And there’s so many people I could thank there’s my Mom and God and above
So all ya’ll, and everybody throw your hands in the sky!
Everyone touch the sky before the day never dies! Dies!
No one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!
They say no one man should have all that power!

"Slavery Was a Choice Pt. 1 [May 1, 2018]",UnKnown,2018.0,"I don't think people necessarily understand what happened last week with the Make America Great Again hat. What are you trying to do with the message you're sending?
It was really just my subconscious. It was a feeling I had, you know like, people, we're taught how to feel. We're taught how to think. We don't know how to think for ourselves. We don't know how to feel for ourselves. People say feel free, but they don't really want us to feel free. And, uh, I felt a freedom in first of all, just doing something that everybody tells you not to do.
...
I just love Trump! That's my boy! You know like, so many rappers, you'll look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump, but then he get into office and now they don't love him. Trump is one of rap's favorite people right?
But we talked about this, that before he was elected president, people in hip-hop it was an in thing to put Donald Trump in your rhymes somewhere.
And by the way, I'm in hip-hop but I'm not just in hip-hop. I'm a black person in the black community but I'm not just that. I feel like one thing is that people try to minimize me to artist, hip-hop, black community...Yeah, I'm always gonna represent that but I also represent the world.
...
You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sound like a choice! . You was there for 400 years and it was all of y'all?
It's like we're mentally imprisoned. I like the word 'prison', because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It's like slavery Holocaust, Holocaust Jews, slavery is blacks...So prison is something that unites us as one race. Blacks and whites being one race. That we're the human race.
Do you feel that I'm being free? And that I'm thinking free?

I actually don't think that you're thinking anything. I think what you're doing right now is actually the absence of thought. And the reason why I feel like that is because Kanye, you're entitled to your opinion, you're entitled to believe whatever you want, but there is fact, and real-world, real-life consequence behind everything that you just said.
While you are making music, and being an artist, and living the life that you've earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years that you said, for our people was a choice!
Frankly, I'm disappointed. I'm appalled. And brother, I am unbelievably hurt by the fact that you have morphed into something, to me, that's not real.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-slavery-was-a-choice-pt-1-may-1-2018-annotated

1st Verse:
I gotta girl at home
But she don't cook
I have my condoms in the store cause she won't look
And she neva-eva go to the grocery sto
So I figure it's safe to pull a grocery-ho
She was buyin Alize out the liquor aisle
She said, 'i hope its not too ghetto'
Rock-Dawg, Gold Force, Baggy style
I kept her number on file
For my girl be actin wyld
Like last week, I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My otha girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, sixteen
Now the car only 1 yrs old, oh
Man, but the body look grown, ""whooa!""
Before I catch a case I betta take my ass home
Where the problems is
Arguments be daily like
Carson is

Why don't chu talk to the mouth a the horses
Bout my porshes?
Condo's in front a the golf courses
Instead you stay up
Count every second like a fake rolley
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way this relationship should go if you know me
I ain't call you
You wanna know why? I mean you know why
How on the low I push jet-skee's so I
Couldn't return them pages, on my motorolla
Nextel, my cell it don't work down there
And what happened in cancun, stay down there
What's happenin here, made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat. Why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
What the problem is?!?!?

So don't trip when I come home after two
Or three or four
I ain't messin wit them girls no more...this week
The benz coup is so sweet
When I roll down the street
Tears roll down her cheeks
She said, 'you must love that car more than me'

So you need to work on your priorities
If she went wit 'Fabulous'

This weed and this drink I got is almost gone
And I've been doing wrong my whole life long
So here's my song
Here's my song

Five pounds of dro
Five rounds or mo'
Tore from the flo'
Two sets of hoes
K. West to go

Okay one more for me)

Let me talk on this
Let me walk on this
Mark Spitz extra clips of hollow tips
I'm full throttle with Chicago trips
Hits model chicks without the bread
Moet bottles flip, I'm out my head
Yeah
Okay no more for me
Fuck it, one more for me
Send another round around for all my Gs
Quarterback in the streets
Throw a zip for three
Mr. MC on the beats that still spin when I freeze
In the city by the sea, bitch
Feel the breeze
Hot head, I got steel to squeeze
See easy

The west is on my back, K. West is on the track
'kay?
Now we fiend to get it jumpin' like the jacks
Dimes and hoodrats, get down on the flo'
And pop that ass 'til it's time to go


I came to the club with a gang of niggas
But I left from the club with a gang of bitches
Just got my pimp cup now my name is Bishop
In a money green suit, ice cane and lizards
The P chain still hangs but it's changed to Spitz
The blues always authentic gangsta shit
Now take this and run with it
Go have fun with it
But make sure you bring it back when you're done with it
Long Beach done done it again
It's been ten
And we've been it since then as little kids
You niggas can't tell me shit on how to sell with this
I'm hot as hell, we done done it again



Don't worry Chi-town

Leave the club now, come back when you get dough
Many hoes, many many many many many hoes
Centerfolds, especially I'm in the Go
Cadillac back to back, red, black to indigo
Tell me that I ain't pimpin' yo
Especially they in a row?
Keep a least two, that can't keep they cool

On Genius and Fashion,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2013.0,"Wait a second, would you rather me not talk at all? ’Cause I don’t want to like, I don’t want to rattle no cages or nothing, I don’t want to like, I don’t want to get in trouble. I want to be scared. I’m trying my best to be scared. I’m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don’t want to talk. I don’t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I’m just going to tip-toe on this
I’m scared of anonymous comments online. I’m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I’m sorry. I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn’t give me already. I’m scared. I’m scared.  I’m so shook. I’m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo
You ain’t never seen, you ain’t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y’all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y’all for giving me this moment in time. ’Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There’s so many people have a moment and they don’t own it
You know, it’s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there’s the connotation of that. But what I need y’all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y’all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y’all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius
’Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it’s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you’re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you’re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth
You watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don’t, you don’t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they’re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren’t going to talk about the money we made. They’re going to talk about the impact we had. They’re going to talk about the impact we had
And being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn’t be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. ’Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star
But what’s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. ’Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don’t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time
And the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he’s at the such and such show, and that’s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can
So I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I’ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don’t let me sing because I want y’all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that’s cute, that’s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it’s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn’t be no Kanye west if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I’m saying?
But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don’t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don’t want to break their motherfucking cool, don’t nobody want to look like a fool
My boy , who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn’t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don’t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they’re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I’m saying, like I’m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I’m saying, like I’m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I’m saying? Have y’all ever read or heard someone say, “I don’t like Kanye West”?
I’ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He’s a nice guy. He’s a nice guy. He’s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I’m like, “Damn, I wish I could be likeable like them.” I wish people would like me like that
So what they basically did was, at Fashion Week… Let me explain something to you… I don’t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That’s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized
So if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn’t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he’s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let’s rewind, is above a music producer, and it’s above a rapper
’Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can’t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you’re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, “I am a god!” Just for them to let you a little bit up
But you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell’s such a nice guy. ’Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted—I didn’t price it, but the world reacted to it—I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this , that’s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, “I’m sorry, Mr. West, but you’re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You’re not going to be able to create anything else again.” They said, “I’m sorry,” and I said, “But wait a second. I sold out.” They said, “I’m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.”
And right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. ’Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? ’Cause that’s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?
And what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that’s why I’m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I’m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin’ tight jeans that you want. I’m the nigga that, you know I’m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can’t go to Riccardo’s show and you can’t go to Phoebe’s show
But he wouldn’t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn’t say that to . And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y’all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what’s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What’s the worst they gonna do tell me I can’t go to these shows again? What’s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I’m a musician, I don’t have any ideas for clothing again? What’s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?
But I’mma tell y’all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I’mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain’t gonna steal from people’s ideas like H&M. And we ain’t gonna steal people’s ideas like Zara. We gon’ make our own shit. We gon’ combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon’ take them from Harvard, and we gon’ take them from St. Mark's, and we gon’ take ’em from the street
And I’m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. I’m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I’m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song…
Hold up, hold up. I’m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin’ now! Almost forgot that part",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-genius-and-fashion-lyrics

On Hurricane Katrina,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2005.0,": 
With the breach of three levees protecting New Orleans,
 
the landscape of the city has changed dramatically, tragically, and perhaps irreversibly. There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.
: 
I hate the way they portray us in the media.
 
If you see a black family, it says “they’re looting.” If you see a white family, it says “they’re looking for food.”
 And you know, 
it’s been five days
 because 
most of the people 
are
 black
 and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because 
I’ve tried to turn away from the TV because it’s too hard to watch
. 
I’ve even been shopping before even giving a donation.
  So now I’m calling my business manager right now to see what’s… 
what is the biggest amount I can give
 and… and just to imagine if 
I
 was… if I was down there and those are… those are my people down there. 
So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help
. 
With… with the setup, the way America is set up to help the…uh the uh, the poor, the… the black people, the uh… the less well-off as slow as possible.
 I mean, this is, 
Red Cross is doing everything they can.
 We… 
we already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war, right now
, fighting another way, and they’ve… 
they’ve given them permission to go down and shoot us.
: And subtle and but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is the 
lasting damage to the survivors’ will to rebuild and remain in the area
. The destruction of the spirit of the people of Southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being the 
most tragic loss of all

Then the harder you fall

And nobody around

And I'm

Falling, I'm

Beggin' for someone to save me
Cryin' for help every night
Hoping that someone would come to my rescue
And see that I'm hurting
But here in the valley
You're all on your own
And you've got to confess
Confess to your soul
Or your personal demons
That eat your whole
So I look to the sky
When I thought I was dyin'
And it must have been God's
Grace on my side
Cause I saw through the shadows
The glory, His light
And I knew that if I could
Just get through the night

I'd be
Flyin'
Flyin', I'm
Flyin'
Flyin', I'm

I found my grace in the valley
I found my faith in the valley

Everything I Am SNL Freestyle,The Graduate,2007,"Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in ""Chicago"" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the sum-time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mi-mink boots in the winter time like Will.I.Am

Let me know if you feel it man
I just messed up on my rap, live TV like damn
But hey, hey here we again yeah
He-here we go again
People talking this but when this hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me
Now break it down

Yo, off the top of the dome, dome
Shout out to Chi-town where I call home
Coast to coast, LA to New York to London to Paris
Shout out to Barry
That's my security guard
Cause my rhymes is hard
Listen up I got to praise god
For the number one spot that I got cause I'm hot
And everything I am cause of everything I was not
Cause I never was shot
They said I'd never make raps to hit the block
Or never sold a crack rock
But now everybody on the jock
And I got the game lock
Everybody bring it back
With the rap I don't know how to act I go crazy
Backstage, Beyoncé and Jay-Z
And LeBron and I'm gone
I'm the don, number one
Keep going going on
Got to keep it going on
I keep goin' goin' goin' yeah
I keep flowin' flowin' flowin'
Yo, I meant to freestyle, I meant to mess up
Y'all meant to dress up
Ay yo, I'm fresh up
Who fresher than Mr. West uh
No-no-no-no-nobody I'm talking all y'all right now
The blogs, the blogs
Yo, they try to dis me
But they can not see I'm on Saturday Night getting busy
Y'all wish ya can be me, hey mama can you see me?
Hey daddy can you see me?
I'm rocking on your TV
Y'all thought they'd never let me back in NBC, see?

Only new beginnings, no such thing as over
We should have just stayed friends
That never opened up or needed closure (God)

Hello my only one, remember who you are

American Psycho (Short Film),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Disick: Hey, do you like Kanye West?
Cheban: Yeah, he's okay, I guess
D: Well, the early work was a little too hip-hop for me in my taste, but when Dark Twisted Fantasy came out in 2010, I think he really came into his own, both musically and lyrically
D: Kanye's been compared to Jesus, Hitler, Walt Disney, and even Steve Jobs
C: Hey Disick
D: Yes Jonathan?
C: Why do you have copies of Billboard magazine all over the place? Do you have a little dog - a little chow or something? *laughs*
D: No, Jonathan!
C: Is that a raincoat?
D: Yes, it is! Now, Kanye's decided to release this, Yeezus, his most exciting record so far. It should be obvious by now that ""New Slaves"" is the undisputed masterpiece of Yeezus. A song so catchy, most people won't even remember the lyrics! But they should. And then there's the song ""I Am a God"". The title practically speaks for itself, but of course the insecurities of the mainstream music press will never understand its true meaning because it's about me! Hey Jonathan!

2015 BET Honors Visionary Award Acceptance Speech,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled. I want to say some ""thank you""s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this
So, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, ""You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude."" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money
And it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote ""Nigga lover"" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, ""Dad why you going so crazy?"" He said to her, ""One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.""
So, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea
Harriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool
I thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil.

You know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I’m uncontrollable or something. Like I don’t do what I’m supposed to do.
 You know it’s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It’s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are
Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star.
 See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I’m concerned everybody’s a star
You know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams.
 Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don’t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies
You know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let’s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin’ out of control tonight. We goin’ out of control tonight. Ahh
How many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? 
Now with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn’t fucking awesome? 
See this is what I’m talking about.This is what I’m talking about. This is what I’m talking about. I mean, this is what I’m talking about, this is what I’m talking about
How many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they’ll say, I don’t know what’s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I’m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they’re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize — I don’t know if that’s a word or not, but it’s now a word, cuz I said it’s a fucking word — and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y’all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager … how many people want to contribute something to the world?
You see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I’m not —  making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light — I’m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I’m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit,  people they talk to you like you’re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I’m not gonna call no names out, 
I’m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that.
 I’m not going to say no names or anything
But if you’re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I’ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I’m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I’m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I’m just saying, don’t discriminate against me, because I’m a black man or because I’m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren’t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. 
They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right?
 They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?
And they say, “No, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That’s too much. That’s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That’s way too much. That’s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don’t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.”
That’s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain’t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let’s set ‘em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It’s about my dreams. It’s about everybody’s dreams. It’s about creating. It’s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it’s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will
And I’m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you’re gonna try. You’re gonna try to break them down. Don’t say you’re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I’m gonna marry you! And I’m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I’m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don’t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn’t my fault. They try to control y’all and try to control me. 
And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, “We don’t negotiate with celebrities.” That’s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it’s fucking terrorist
You know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that’s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now. If you just want to be awesome and make awesome shit and change the fucking world and this is what you plan to do
Let’s have a toast for the douchebags

Clique Freestyle,UnKnown,2012.0,"What's the best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less of they time
What's the best form, best, best form of genocide?
Black-on-black crime
Cause I guess it takes up less time
Now, if you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
If you can make the niggas kill the other niggas, go figure
Then we'll have more time to make real figures
And we can still keep it lookin' at them like
""Damn, look at those real niggas
With they chains and they cars, but they still niggas""
Cause soon as a nigga gets it
Then another nigga wants to get it
Soon as another nigga has a girl
Then another nigga wants to hit it, admit it
Soon as a nigga has a crib
They want to break into that nigga crib
See where he live, see what he did
And don't wanna do the same shit he did to get that crib
Get it? You know, when niggas is killin' niggas
What's amazin' to me
What don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy
Cause they don't phase me
Cause I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people don't think
See, I don't give a fuck what people think
Cause people just don't think
Now picture this; now if I show up onto this motherfucker
And express myself creatively
They always want to say, ""He's crazy, see""
And when they so distressed
What would be the best thing to write?
How 'bout this: ""Kanye West wears a dress""?
Yes, now maybe that can take away from the way
I kick them niggas ass on 12/12/12
Maybe that can take away
Nah, nah, nigga, they seen it, these niggas seen it theyself
Well, and my grandfather ninety-seven
He said, ""I ain't never seen you get down like that""
He ain't give a fuck about the kilt, this dress
Whatever the fuck they call it
You see, niggas killin' niggas
You can't see through the fog
With all the negativity that they write on a blog
I give a fuck about what somebody think
If that person doesn't think
It's too early in the conversation anyway
You know, they say, ""You should be embarrassed
You should be embarrassed, you a nigga
How the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in Paris?""
You should be embarrassed, you should be
Didn't you read the reviews, the press?
I don't give a fuck, I guess
I don't give a fuck, no, it's not that I don't give a fuck
It's that I give most of the fuck and I'm not givin' up
And it's not that I'm crazy, no, that's a lie
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
And I would die for what I believe in
When I see that, uh, just a change what y'all receivin'
Do you all receive us? Do y'all believe it? It's too much
Okay, there's someone they can't touch
How 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity?
That's me, that's me, niggas killin' niggas
""Why he do that? Why he wear that?
Why he say that? Where he play it?
Oh, my God, nigga, niggas
It's bad enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough, it's hard enough
It's hard enough, it's hard enough
But you can never say I didn't give my heart enough
And if we did somethin' good
And we didn't say, ""Oh, excuse me. Pardon us""
Then they want to throw niggas back
On, on, on the retarded bus
And when they riot in the streets
They gon' say, ""What, what the fuck started us?
And made 'em start it up?""
And look at me like I ain't smart enough
And everybody got a suggestion and a lesson
And a question and a stress
And then they always want to stress a man, uh
And say, ""Maybe he's too aggressive"", or, uh, well
Maybe the shit you doin' is just not impressive to a nigga
So let me make this clear
It won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout nobody comin' to Atlantic City
Talkin' 'bout, ""Oh, it's just a casino show""
Or, ""It's just New Years, so we can't do nothin' really creative""
No, I'm talkin' about a motherfucker workin' every day
From four o'clock in this buildin'
Readjustin' all these fuckin' cameras
To make this show better and better
Better every night for y'all
And all they can say, ""He got a mask on. He crazy""
But they just tryin' to fuckin' deter you
From what you are seein' in front of you
This is ""Jesus Walks"", this is ""Can't Tell Me Nothing""
I'm not crazy, I'm just not satisfied
So maybe let this time open up your mind
And let you know that you can do anythin' in life
Yeah, baby, you can shine
This right here lets you know you can do anythin' in life
With enough time and focus and focus and time and time
And don't let nobody tell you
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique
When I look around, they don't do it like my clique, so here
Since they'll probably put this online
Let me make this shit real clear
Michael Jackson died from a lack of information
From motherfuckers bein' around him lyin' to him
Actin' like shit okay, but I'm a find the information
Don't believe nothin' that they say
Don't matter who you look up to
Don't take more than ninety percent of what the fuck they say
Cause they are not you
And that extra ten percent is what makes you you
So you do what the fuck you want to do
And if somebody tell you you can't do it
Be like, ""Man, who the fuck are you?""
You only got one life that you know about, you only got
And time is somethin' you can never get back
Most important thing
Don't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get back
So don't forgot that cause the money could go
And you could spend it over and over
And over and over, over, over, oh
And the cars could crash
And now did that tell me, ""What do you have?""
And the house can burn down
And whose your real friends when you turn around?
Yeah, that's your clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do like my clique

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack ya' money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you, we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say:
""We don't care what people say""

""Hey Kanye, this is your cousin Kim
I just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this CD, it's hot!
Especially that song “Drug Dealer”
You know, I've been a social worker for 10 years
I've been paying people's lights, rents, mortgage
You talkin' 'bout people paying shine on $6.55 an hour;
People can't pay their rent for $6.55 an hour
So, it just... It's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through
You know, and people are human
They wanna look good, they wanna take pride at how they look, they wanna take pride at what they do
The other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax
A lot of times, what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in
The toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care- Landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in
So, they borrow somebody else's kid, so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work, 'cause you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance. ('til it get sky high)
So you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth;
You have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation, then you get paid on the job
So, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids.... You know, and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that, I mean like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know
Tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it...
That they try to send their kids to school...
That they try to make a difference.""

Yeah. DC. Stand up for your boy ? Oh, I go by the name of Kanye To The. The Roc is in the building. And as far as I'm concerned, we're about to bring that real soul back to the game. John Legend on the backgrounds by the way. Let's go
Verse One :
From what I hear Kanye is killing that game very bad
My girl rockin' the little lamb that Mary had
Little bit of ghosta style mixed with Mosta style
I'm versatile, I'm the poster child
Gettin' cheese so I'm supposed to smile
Get it?
We making hits like Sosa now
Hit it!
And I, hate when girls actin' boushie as hell
And I already seen 'em naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gonna make my kids stupid as well?
Well
Our Father, please for give me
I am sinner, slash winner, slash soul inventor
C'mon
Chorus 
It's so soulful man 
And when you hear, swear it feel like soul food man

Verse Two 
Look, my mommy don't be playin' cause she know I got my game intact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
And chickens know I'm gonna do it like I wanna do it
And miscommunication, no we never run into it
I got chicks like Samone and Colla
Stay with lip gloss and Fendi bag beside her
And your girl said she ain't ready for me
I'm in love so mommy got me singin' Teena Marie
High above the Giovanni, she ain't Gucci or Prada
Climbin' in the Mirada, studin' like a scholar
So I don't even bother
I be poppin' my collar
I can get into your soul when I call you tomorrow
C'mon
Chorus
Verse Three :
I know you gotta lot of stress today
Let's hit the party like we just got paid
Now if you really want to get away
Say yeah, yeah
Got people on your back constantly
And you never get a second for free
You know you gotta get away with me
So say yeah, yeah
Verse Four :
Yo, I'ma worry bout the trades and ballin'
I'm gonna trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and evade them all
You sore losers picked the wrong guy to take a fall
I probably train and fall
For what they made in the fall
Made it to a never-quite-was to an overnight buzz
Cause the way I flip a metaphor, nobody quite does
By the time I leave the club
I'm weighing the pros and cons
Cause she must have been a pro the way she approach the Cons
And Con man is an army
Money boss on
We so big be hoppin' out when I'm tryin' to do my laundry
But I ain't even sorry for the way I get my doe
Cause J, Kanye and Con got that food for your soul, go!

Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin ""Cheers to you for your future years of pain""
Like ""Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter""
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said ""Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now""

I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh
Can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon
Ooooh, as I continue as I, Ooooh, as I continue as I
Oooh, Oooh",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-out-the-game-lyrics
"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (Exclusive)",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggas drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin' liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, 'cause I'm ugly ducklin'
Got a stain and its musty, wakin' up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin' to me ""don't touch me""
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggas give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggas ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin', she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone 'cause she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said ""I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes""
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said ""Ye' you don't love me""
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin' you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, 'cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin' my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
That's bad meaning bad not bad meaning good
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good 'cause I'm good
Now I'm havin' some good nights, livin' this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin' that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin' you the good the bad the ugly",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-exclusive-lyrics

This a story about a bad girl that used to be good
A miseducation of Lauryn that stayed in the hood
See she probably could have made it in Hollywood
But she was misguided, misled, and misunderstood
She wanted her baby dad with good hair like Blair Underwood
And push a whip with 12 cylinders under the hood
Now she got 6 kids to feed under her roof
She didn't want her daughters to end up in the same position
So she named one hope named the other ambition
But the problems with poverty left them with no choice
Then one got locked
Then one got popped

On MediaTakeout,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016.0,"Now - Media Takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world
You seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down. when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it
Respect the struggle. respect the hustle. respect the dreams.  respect the movement
I had an album listening and clothing presentation and Madison Square Garden
People were crying. people were throwing up the fist. people were dancing
But Media Takeout couldn't say one thing positive knowing damn well you'd love to be on the YEEZY 350 list
You probably got bootleg Yeezy's on right now
I'm a human being. I'm an artist, bro
Your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far. you have no idea what I've had to go through
So many people didn't make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion
Fashion ain't no joke for me. It's a way of life. creative expression and industry
I've given everything I had for this moment. a lot of people feel it's the paradigm shift
And I'm proud of this picture with me and Caitlyn. She gave the most heart felt speech at my wedding
And was there in full support to see me realize this dream
Wow the paradigm  has shifted, She killed it. everything is changed now!!!! Lil Sis kiiiiiiiilled this shit!!!!!!!
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK ALL THE HATERS   PUT YOUR MIUTHERFUCKING FIST IN THE SKY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'M SO HYPE RIGHT NOW    EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED  . HAVE YA'LL EVER SEEN TRON? THE END OF THE TRON WHERE EVERYTHING LIGHT UP!!!!

Lease see these next tweets as such because the ideas will jump around a bit… a bit like a mood board...
Up late designing in Sweden…
Super inspired by my visit to Ikea today , really amazing company… my mind is racing with the possibilities…
Playing the new Kendrick…  1 thousand images on the desktop…  Hennessy & what’s left of the ice and coke zero…
Sitting with @Robinnowicki from @ustwo working on the YEEZY site…
Really happy to get the quality of the products better at half the prices of last year…
Bear with me guys, Rome wasn’t built in a day but I promise to keep my promises…
So proud of my brother @VirgilAbloh with his new @OffWht collection!!!
Was speaking with @souljaian earlier about a new idea…
Met with @Hermes_Paris family yesterday… been out here fighting for 13 years and it feels like we’re finally seeing wins…
Can’t wait to get home to North, Saint and my wife…
Sometimes the quiet moments feel like I’m home from battle…
What war?  a class war… a war against time…
Feeling like Robin Hood…
@Adidas is making a million Yeezys this year, opening up new factories…
It’s been a lot of confusion in the past 3 weeks so let me apologize for in any way being confusing…
I guess in a media world where you never hear the truth, the truth can come off as crazy…
Thank you to @asvpxrocky for supporting me at the MSG show…
Together we stand… we win…
The future thinkers win…
The artists win...
The thinkers win…
The pure of heart win…
We win

That Nigga Jigga Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro 
DJ Boom, beats on streets and here with my man Kanye West
Producer of H to the Izzo, Takeover and all that. Let them know man

Yo, it's Kanye to the man. Just play my shit man
Let a nigga hear somethin' finally. (Holla)
Yo, DJ Boom, back for the first time. It's really my first time yo
This is...Kanye to the. Not on the beat though
You know what I'm sayin'? ON the beat motherfuckers
What up G? What up Hop? Look, c'mon

As a shorty had a Schwinn, look that's the best bikes
Shorty had three friends, that's my best dykes
Said her best friend wanna see what Kanye West like
Cause her man dress like a transvestite
You ain't know I get a deal because I rhyme tight
Sport Rocs before your deal to be an Unsigned Hype
Give a fuck about your rippin' down some open mics
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these beats for free, psych
You rappers too lame, you ain't James, y'all ain't worthy
I fly out to Newark just to get some new jerseys
I be back to Chi about every two Thursdays
I can't buy water around niggas too thirsty
I can't rock ice around niggas too hatin'
Can't rock Motorola, niggas two wayin'
I Alter like Beast in an altercation
Infrared make you juke like Walter Payton
So, grand theft auto
Come up out your auto
Mobile, before I pull more steel than Soprano
Still trying to make more meals than McDonald's
So cut my slice like Giordano's
And they did
I made 500 Gs in this
First beat on what The Truth and The Reason is
She told me if you read music you a genius
I don't play but I'll introduce you to my pianist
Now, tell me that's that regular producer rap
You can listen to the flow and tell I used to rap
You look in my eyes
Think I won't use the gat?
Until
Paramedics gotta use the bag
Cause
In my eyes, you'se the fag
You're like a hermaphrodite dyke dressed in drag
So let's see how many slugs that vest can have
And you ain't really the worst, you just next to last
Uh, Kanye to the...motherfuckin' West
Outro 
Yo, DJ Boom, good lookin' out man
Cause ah, niggas is really doubtin'
Niggas lookin' at a lot of motherfuckers they see on TV
And just figure-they be like, ""Oh, you rap?""
Naw, motherfucker, I just did beats nigga
To have some shit to rap on nigga
Ha ha, I'm tryin' to understand, why the fuck if a nigga got hot beats
He can't have hot rhymes? Why is that nigga?
Why niggas just can't do a lot of shit good?
What a nigga can chew gum and tie his shoes at the same time?

I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like  to 'em
Aye yo, I've got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary, Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Before I lose it and have to prove it
This the way that we gon', time; we gotta move it to the future
Karma Sutra, any way that suit ya
Don't shoot ya, stop the violence and it's been stopped
We stopped the violence in the hip-hop
We stopped the hatin' and the degradation
We 'bout to build like One Nation
Got off the phone with Benjamin Carson
Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
Cause they say, ""Ye, don't play that""
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye Juice
That's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial

I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
Well, you see, my mama divorced my daddy
And moved my family when I was 3
And in the cold, straight from Chicago where I go
And everybody know, from my homie Don C, I be air
Aye, yo, like IBM or Apple, Steve Jobs of this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Aye, yo, it's very, very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel, I can do it every tempo
I'll use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build churches
That could be as big as The Adam's Family's, where Lurch is
Aye, yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed, motherfuckers
It ain't no cursin' in the verse which you know is not perfect
And now you know it's still worth it
I might short-circuit, I might just black out
Hit you with that ""BLOCKA!""
You know I'm Ibaka
Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Because God on my side, that's the way I ride
Jesus Christ, Yeezus nice!

One time I had lost my faith
But I had to stay faithful and grateful for the God I was given
The way that I was livin' or the life that I've been livin'
It didn't make a difference
See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents
Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather
Mother, father, now I've only got one parent
Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent
But still you've got to stay strong
I don't know what everybody else is on
Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out
Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now
And I doubt they even listen, and I ain't tryna diss 'em
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
And everybody say bein' a rockstar is everything
But see, I wanna do everything
And I know I could do everything
And be anything that I wanna be
So simply, if you wanna be like Mike
I wanna be like Christ, I wanna be that nice
You know what I'm saying?

Ooh, you so boozy, boo, you could've fooled me
'cause five years ago, you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs

Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go

I'm workin' hard like a fiend tryin' to get some dope
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer

The sex is good but you ain't a shooter
There's a war goin' on inside, you ain't a trooper

We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Why did that happen?

We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
We couldn’t stop — we would stop — MJ playing for the Wizards
Why did that happen?
Six championships
The best years of our life
Playing through the flu
Every single night
I believed I could fly
And I wanted to be just like Mike
I believed I could fly
And I wanted to be just like Mike
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Why did that happen?
Does anybody here know why that happened?
When a player
When a player wants to become an owner
When a player
When a player that’s done more for the league than the league could’ve done for him
When a player that made the NBA wants to become an owner of the team that he brought so much glory to, a team he brought so much story to
A team that has his statue in the front of the motherfucking building
But do you know what the owners of that team told MJ?
You’re just a player, homeboy
You can’t get no pay
You can’t own shit
They told Michael Jordan he couldn't own shit!
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
We should’ve never ever let MJ play for the Wizards
Now y’all know why MJ went to play for the Wizards
Because this very team wouldn’t let him be an owner
I’m talking about one of the most important people in our civilization
One of the most influential people in our civilization
They tried to marginalize
And in order to make his point he had to put on a motherfucking Wizards jersey
To let y’all know “Oh yes I am gonna be an owner just like Magic Johnson”
We should’ve never let MJ ever play for the Wizards
Never never never never let him go
Because til I die MJ represents the Bulls
So tonight I’m about to put my 23 on
So tonight I gotta put my 23 on",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-michael-jordan-lyrics

Gotta Pose,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Kanye to The, yeah, you heard the name
Checks plus raps finna murder the game, uh
Can y'all get it? Fuck y'all
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

All these niggas believe
They breathe the same air that I breathe and bleed like I bleed
Only difference though, I fuck better hoes
Iceberg clothes, I got to pose
Every whip with the studio in a hospital
This nigga flow is very sick
Plus very rich hoes, very thick chain, very thick
Feel like I could fuck every bitch
Twenties at the bottom, carry the six
If I cop back, then shot him, I buried him six
You can't hate this nigga with the platinum braces
I rather need new teeth than a whole facelift
Plus your taste is rather tasteless
Test my aim and watch me ace this
You wack rap cats need a replacement
So I hit the basement, took it back to basics
Reach down to my Timbs, grab my laces
Got loops on niggas, y'all want a tight noose on niggas
If I ain't holler at you for (?), niggas
What the fuck I got to do, another truth for niggas?
See, it don't really matter what y'all prove to niggas
Y'all ain't satisfied 'til we shoot some niggas
So if somebody got to die, tell me who want it
That Chi-Town, South Side bullshit, we on it

Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop, then froze
I got to pose

Man, bitch, I ain't finished with your ass
Heavy all night, spendin' cash at the ball
At the show and before we got back
At the gas station buyin' your ass snacks
At the liquor store buyin' act right juice
So when we get bid-ad, you know how to hit that
Next time, bring some friends for me to get at
But no fat hoes, you expect me to hit that?
Molly set me up like, ""K got scratched""
Run up in the crib mad, stuck with that
Y'all niggas talk that, but y'all don't really lit that
So I had to hit them with the flat out, get your ass out
You tuned in with the boss of the bosses
NFL, no fuckin' losses
Chain flossless, fuck with it cost us
We go broke, we take y'all for hostage

Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows
Then she drop and froze
I got to pose

You see me rollin', smokin', coastin', boastin'
Plus a little gone off the potion
Oh, and known for flossin' a little too often
Might end up in a coffin
I'm floatin' cause I don't smoke like that
Y'all niggas want to plot, we don't joke like that
Faggot-ass niggas get approached like that
Matter of fact, murder gettin' wrote like that
I'm finna take these niggas back to the streets
Back to hoppin' out the 'Lac with the heat
Back to the fifty, posin' with some bitches
In front of that airbrushed 2Pac picture

Who you know twenty-five that rolls?
Fifteen carats on top of the white gold
Pull up in the drop, then froze
I got to pose
Go on 'head, baby, you could pose
Gettin' naked at Go-Getter shows

Now every chick in here swear I got millions
In area codes with unidentified children

Throw my hoodie on, blend in like chameleons
Take my hoodie off, they like ""What up Ye, you chillin'?""
Swear to god they just like children
Just like high school, back at my school
Just like Halloween, minus the costumes
The nigga that's flickin' be the ones that's trickin'
The girls two seatin' be the ones that's treatin'
Do a test on relationships, everybody cheatin'

Throw Jordans on the truck now just to look decent

That's how long I been on ya

When the fast life takes its tole
That act right makes everything slow
Them black lights make everything glow
One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something
People be talking to you like you nothing
Then you be like bitch I'm me
Then your boss be like bitch then leave
You covered up your tats too long with them sleeves
You've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe
Would you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen
So get all in they face like Noxzema
I know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans
Please don't hit that raw, it's not clean
Please don't forget that all when it seems

N-now th-that that don't kill me

Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit

Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel homie, take 6, and take this, haters


I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in ya plans or not
I'm tripping, this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm tripping, I'm caught up in the moment, right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it

Improvise,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wouldn't vibrate
No I seen her inner eyes
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive
Told her I had a girl, nah I didn't lie
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibrate
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe
Boo back in 92' I was just like you
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other guy buy ice to stay cool
Like any other kid that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel
(2X)
We ball 'til we fall
Hit the mall
After we
Hit don't call
We fill your lives
With nothing but lies
And I would like to
Apologize
But you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be alright
'Cause until the day a real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise

Was it something I did wrong?
Yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though, man that hurt yo
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo
And she don't call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges
Never had money so I feel like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry
Trying to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari, and a dinner date with Halle Berry?
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week
No I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys
And focus on school full-time to improvise

No no, you can't stand right here
And tell me everything is gonna be alright
'Cause until that real man stands up
I'm going to have to improvise. ",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-improvise-lyrics

Know The Game,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, this that shit
Just to let niggas know
You can’t fuck with us

But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
Sit down nigga, I know the game
Clothes shopper, I know the game
Take it and put it back into the store
Crazy cat, ah
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed

Got me talkin bout love, you mean forever
You mean me falling in love, talking never
She’s missing me after this one chick got together
She told me she had a man but they not together
Let me tell you how I first met her
It’s kinda ill though
I’m downtown tryna find Anita
That’s where I find this diva stand in front the hospital
I double park the car, scream, yo man’s not with you
As for the cigarettes just brought the convo what went on
I man up and eat, her belly holdin on
And as far as she say
Oh that was over, he say she say
So you telling me your man stayed up in micro weeds
Mistaken identity like Cochise and I’m finna be
Holla at you now, know we’ll talk later
And I wanna get up but you got flavor
Now I’ma let you get the cell, let you get the pager
And if you ain’t around no haters you can call me later

But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
Y’all know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed
Cause we know the game

She must’ve known where the dollars at
Cause it ain’t taken long at all but need to holla back
Gave me directions to the crib, told me follow that
And I could park in back where the Impala at
But she ain’t stayed on the southside, south southside
Deeper than the know when
Now I’m questioning whether I should get in that
Plus lasting a lot, walk into the door, haters asking a lot
And where you from nigga? You ain’t from round here
As I peeped out the window said baby I’m right here
He mad cause I’m with her and he ain’t with her
And he stayed down the hallway and he can’t get er
So when I came out the nigga hatin on me was waitin on me
And he had mo guys, no lie
Man I knew we were both wrong, bitch but I know nothing
Finna wear both chains but I know nothing

But I don’t even wanna hit on you, don’t wanna know his name
I know the game, I know the game
And I don’t wanna hear all those excuses, they all the same
We should both be ashamed

Brothers (Demo),Unreleased Songs,2010,"What's it take to call your brother
Just to say you miss him and you wish you could spend time

Let him know you love him
And that he's been on your mind
Tell him that you need your brother
Ask him how he's doing
And say you been doing fine
If it comes a point where you just don't know what to say
While you still have him on the line
Just say

What happens to one of us, happens to us together
And we'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever
We'll be, brothers forever

On Saint Paul and Personal Debt,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016.0,"Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because he was a traveler...
He was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
He was saved from persecution due to his Roman citizenship...
 I have the right to speak my voice...
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins...
All memes are wrong... The Life of Paul... The life of Pablo... Ultralight beams... Moms dads daughters sons stand up...
Let's dance in the streets. I am consumed by my purpose to help the world
I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart...
This is all all is fun all in good feelings... We will all be gone 100 years from now but what did we do to help while we were here!!!
They are calling me to the SNL stage now ... Speak soon...",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-saint-paul-and-personal-debt-lyrics
On the Grammys,Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016.0,"I would like to sit down with Neil Portnow right now
I think the Grammys are super important!!!
I know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine
We need to fix this
I don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon. I say what I feel
I feel the Grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch
Hi Grammys this is the most important living artist talking
If I'm not at the show next year then there is no show
I don't want to just fix the awards for me but I want to fix it for Dexter Navy who directed A$AP Rocky’s LSD video
Everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year!
Dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right!!!
You guys are supposed to be all about taste
You like your black people a certain way also. You wouldn't have Future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer
Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness??? Yes I have a problem with the Grammys
All artists have a problem with it and I am going to fix it for us all starting right now
Neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the Grammys culturally relevant again
Us real music guys wanna have fun too
And always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis 😭😭😭 all positive vibes
First order of business. We the people need to see Future at the Grammys
We need to see Young Thug at the Grammys.  Not just me and Jay in a suit
People ask why I speak in a public forum... Well my voice is my power. Freedom of speech. Freedom of opinion. Freedom of dreams
I'm not crazy I'm free
No slave mindset no more. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free
I wrote Saint Pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt. But I'm not ashamed anymore
I'm proud as an entrepreneur that I gave everything I had to my dreams
I'm happy and free and proud and confident. I'm not crazy. I'm free
Free from being held back by public opinion
It's a beautiful time.  I love my friends. I love my family.  I love people. The human race
You guys will see my heart. You guys will feel my heart. We will make a difference
I just had to start with shoes so that I could be economically empowered enough to have a voice
What is your definition of true freedom? There is no true freedom without economic freedom
Respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids
That is one of the reasons I respect the paps so much
And yes I've talked to Adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free Yeezys and Adidas.  All positive vibes
I'm not even gon lie to you. I love me so much right now
New album coming this summer
I love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up
The world needs a guy like me. The world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth
You won't always agree with me but I'm gon always be me. I'm woke!",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-the-grammys-lyrics

I had a out-of-body off a half a Molly
At the afterparty, had to grab a shawty
She was in the corner all melancholy
We was both rollin' off the edamame
I feel the Devil on me, I feel the pressure on me
Yeah, I said it, call me up and met a zombie on
First the brain releases dopamines
Then you lose all control of things
I'm an addict myself, so I know a fiend
When I see one in Fashion Nova jeans
I'm in that euphoric psychedelic state
All I remember is an angelic face
I felt myself start to elevate to a place called

Euphoria, it's four of ya
There's only two girls, feel like it's four of ya

Take the Adderall with the Xans, that's the morsecode
She took two and some coke, that's an Oreo
You don't remember shit, that's how the story goes
Comin' down, you gon' feel horrible
Just make sure you drink a lot of water, though
Now you startin' to feel the side effects
Like you ain't had the right type of rest
When you grind your teeth and get out of breath
I suggest you take a seat 'cause you high as hell
But don't trip, you fully functional
You just feelin' comfortable
Stop at Walgreens, get a lunchable

On the Grammys (2),Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2016,"I don't even know what he said, I just know that the Grammys, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We ain't finna play with them no more. ""***Flawless"", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé. And at this point, we're tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration. We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody’s speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, I got my daughter and I got my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity. That's the reason why I didn’t say anything tonight. But y'all know what it meant when 'Ye walks on the stage",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-on-the-grammys-2-lyrics

Wooooaah ohhh
Just me and you girl
Wooooaah ohhh

Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Aren't you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown, you asleep with no make-up
I'm just tryna be inside you 'fore you wake up


We had problems but it's all in the past
Everybody got problems baby, algebra class
Remember I used to do things that'd make you laugh
Like orderin' a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like piña coladas, getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But, they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Ain't no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking, your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching, you're pissed off, tripping
Cause even when we're kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like, ""No he didn't?
No he didn't, is you talking about Kitten?
Is that bitch still stripping?
Trying to get a pair of Christians?""
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say, ""How is work baby?""
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See, she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credit's so bad I can't get no one to cosign
I would've thought she would've bust in the door cryin'
But she upped and left a nigga and she ain't give me no sign
Now, she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame, it's a miracle that she'd
Talk to a nigga with a ten-year ago swag
Plus I don't like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote, ""Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends.""
On the phone, hollin' that ""niggas is whatever""
Let's fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome, Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she ain't got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong, except a nigga grown
So I can't bitch and moan, in a session gettin' stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train, to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her, ""Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress.""
Thirty foot train, diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides, I'm so glad you came
Aunty couldn't make it, oh no that's a shame
Wedding in June, what could be better?
Let's fly to Euro, make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor, ""Just drive so far.""
Told some of your friends and they wasn't excited
Well we gon' tour the countryside and they won't be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin' and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Let's make a move from these herds, go somewhere in private

Dr. Kanye West Honorary Doctorate Speech,UnKnown,2015.0,"Prof. Nick Cave: Kanye, you join us today to be recognized for your transformative, genre-defining work across music, performance, film, and fashion design. Your visionary and ambitious career is a true reflection of the creative spirit. So, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Governors of the School of the Arts Institute of Chicago and the Board of Trustees of the Art Institute of Chicago, I now confer upon you the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts, Dr. West
Dr. Kanye West: 
I’m sorry, that was just my opinion
I am a pop artist. So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas
“I’m sorry” is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. 
George Bush… has some very cool self-portraits.
 I didn’t know he was an artist
I felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is “I need to get rid of that feeling.” I need to not be nervous
This honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don’t have to defend me as much, and I’m gonna make all of our lives easier. 
And it’s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I’ve been saying my entire life.
 Whether it’s the cosign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, “It’s okay, he doesn’t bite white people,” or 
the New York Times cover
, or 
the Time “Most Influential” cover
, and now a doctorate at The Art Institute of Chicago

it would have been easier if I could have said: ""I have a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago.""

Everything I'm not made me everything I am

Everything I'm not made me everything I am

I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B. or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'd reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played the big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I'd never rock a mink coat in the summertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the wintertime like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it, man
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again
People not sayin' what's not for him
But everything I'm not made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not made me everything I am

And I'm back to tear it up
Haters, start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun talk or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks or Adidos
Can they add that he just spazzed out at that show?
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India.Arie award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please award

And I'll keep flowin', flowin', flowin'

When I wrote this dope shit, what I noticed was so bogus
A lot of people talk about you when you growin' up
But you got to stay focused
People who was number one in school end up like smokers
People you talk the most about
No doubt, sometimes end up the dopest
Anybody know they can't touch the way I flow
I guess it was the way I run from school to school
And sometimes wasn't treaten cool and broke all the rules
And always ended up in the office like Michael Scott
Now I got rings like Michael got
That's Jordan, let me tell you somethin' more important
You think I wrote this, no, it just comes off the top of my
Whatever topic I
Stop it, I'm probably the best out, Mr. West out
Yo, don't nobody want to bout
I knock people out in the first round. the first down

With the red shoes on just to let you know I'm freestylin'
Yes, ill, I'm wilin'
I see you, uh, at the mall to show this is my mornin' flow
So imagine my midnight sight when I ignite lyrically
I just might, everybody just bite
When I wrote this, I was picturin' a little girl in high school
With people pickin' on her, tellin' her what she not
Then she'd grow up to be model, so they'll be hot
And everything she not made her slam it
Everything she not made it everything she am
That's incorrect English, but I'm way too distinguished
Can understand this, I rock the planets
Cameras be candid, on, I was lookin' at my prior image
My wire image, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin', get it?

Damn, damn, here we go again
People talkin' shit, but when the shit hit the fan

And I'm a keep flowin', flowin', flowin'
And you just keep goin', goin', goin'

The Ellen Show: On Having More Kids,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ellen: How do you think marriage has changed you, if it has?
Kanye: I've definitely learned how to compromise more. Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business. You know, you can't--
Ellen: Beautiful
Kanye: And I've learned how to shut up more and, um, I've--yeah. I think--I think I'm a better human being, you know, because of her
And because of my daughter. And I have, you know, always someone to think about going home to and, you know, something for me to, you know, not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too. Cause there's things I've done in the past that were considered negative, but I was really, you know, jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way. So now I always have to have that in my mind, that I have, like, a family that I have to protect too
Ellen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you. I see you-- And you are calmer, I think. You know, you don't seem, like, uh... like, uh...angry or--you know? You know what I mean? And I don't know if it was even anger, but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out. And now I think your emotions
Are grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--they're going-- they're channeled
In a different way
Kanye: I think I was, like, going through now, like, my version of my terrible twos. My--my daughter, she wants to express herself, but she just doesn't have the words for it. And for me, there's so many things I wanna do with film, with clothing, and I just didn't have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that I could do it, being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things. And now, because of this Adidas deal, they allowed me a little bit of oxygen. Because what you have to understand-- The difference between, you know, what people give you about celebrity, the idea of money versus creativity. There's no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative, if you were born to create. So a lot of times people try to block you, block your creativity, control you with money. And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line, which I wanted to do, and it was just like a little bit of oxygen. You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever. You guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception. Being suffocated by people in a position that could
Blatantly see like, ""Wow, the ""Yeezys"" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But we're not gonna give him
A shot in something else.""  And there's a lot of people who, like, were really calm about that. But the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result. So I tried something different over the past couple years. And I actually got some really good results from it too, so...

Ellen: Well put. Well put. And that is true. I mean, I think we all try to express ourselves. And you do, you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing. It doesn't get
The result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is, and then you get the result because you've shifted. We have to take a break. And then we're gonna show the world premiere of your new video, which I absolutely love. I love this song so much. You actually played it for me in our living room, and I just was blown away how beautiful the song is
Cut
Ellen: So, uh, more kids?
Kanye: Yeah, we're trying
Ellen: Really?
Kanye: Yeah, yeah
Ellen: I thought I'd slip that in there. I mean, that baby is so adorable, and, I mean, she is precious. She's so-- And smart as can be, right?
Kanye: Mm-hmm
Ellen: Yeah, she's-- Oh, look at that. So you're gonna have more? How many do you want, like a bunch? Like a Brad and Angie bunch? Or, uh--
Kanye: I just want whatever Kim wants
Ellen: Wow. Um... That's--that's a good answer, whether it's true or not. And what is the name of the CD?
Kanye: I don't know yet. We're still trying to find it. Trying to find the vibe. You know, this transition from what I felt when I did ""Yeezus"" to what I feel now, and, you know, we're just creating. So we haven't found it yet
Ellen: Okay. What about ""Ellen's My Friend""?
Kanye: Yeah. I think that's pretty good
Ellen: Okay, think about that",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-the-ellen-show-on-having-more-kids-lyrics

This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'ma take, five, ten stacks of some D's it's gon' be a different kind of D's
You know what I'm saying? Hm?
(Chorus 1)
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different...
Cute little college chick, linin' up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Ain't that a true bitch?
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you how to do this shit
(Verse One)
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you, but you know how 'Ye do
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says ""is that Jesus?""
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift, they all up in
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's...
(Chorus 2)
Kanye's got stacks, y'all already know that
Louis that, Gucci this, just got a model chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Man, that's a prerequisite
Cute chick living good, down here in Hollywood
Upcoming actress, but she got a flat chest
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
That'll give her access
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Let me show you what happened
(Verse Two)
Walking down Melrose, spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad, tell by the Chloe bag
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's, Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
I couldn't tell you if Halle's really real
But I'ma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say f**k getting them D's
I'ma just ride out with these",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-throw-some-ds-interlude-lyrics

"Trend is always late [April 18, 2018]",UnKnown,2018.0,"trend is always late
when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.
You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.
Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.
I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.
You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.
just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.
in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner
everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to ""the simulation"".  Parents are our first acting coaches.
oh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.
me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.
Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.
There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.
too much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update.
Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie 🤷‍♂️
I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like ""this person stole this from me"" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere 😂
let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-trend-is-always-late-april-18-2018-annotated
"On Paparazzi, Celebrities, and Activists",Kanye West’s Visionary Streams of Consciousness,2008.0,"The problem I have with the paparazzi is if they’re right in front of you and you’re like, “Can you please not take a picture of me?” And they’re like, “Dude I’m not really taking a picture,” and they just keep on doing it like they’re talking to me like I’m stupid and stuff, and then, with arm sprints, 
I’m going to grab the camera,
 that just happens, and you don’t expect that to happen with a celebrity, cause 
you think they’re like a museum animal and stuff
, but it’s like, 
don’t shoot the animals
, then, maybe, I don’t know.

What’s interesting, though, the problem is that once you do something like that, the word’s out. And these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm. So it’s kind of a no-win situation a little bit.

Well except for the fact that I’m going to do something about it. You know, I’m going to make a change. I think it’s my responsibility.
 
My mom, she got arrested for being in the sit-ins at age 6

But I need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world

I am of service to the world with my art and I just want to serve more
I am ultra light beaming right now. So many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
I know I confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me

Uh, that's the next president, arson
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn, like Ice Cube said
Uh, I'm the rudest
Lot of people say that, cause they say Ye don't play that
They be off that Grey Goose, I be off that Ye juice
Uh, that's the way I stay loose
Confidence and esteem, American dream
Uh, my crib spacial
Uh, my relationship is interracial

You can't categorize me, you can't put me in a box
I'm the ox that rocks, bagels and locks
Learn what you're eatin', learn the menu
Cause I continue to send freestyles through your denu
Or should I say I dim you, down like a lightswitch
That's the way it is, Big Boy, you know I'm not a yitch
I gotta go 'head and censor myself
And if you look into my pocket, I'm a little bit of wealth
But anyway, Ida's son, the real McCoy
Ida's son, the homies, they call me Big Boy
Yesterday, today, 
I had to drop 7-10 cause it's Kanye West day
In the neighborhood, Power 106, it's all good
That's the way it is, I think you should
Let me get back on, because I'm fallin' off again
Let me kick my volume way past 10
'Because it's Ida's son, the B-I-G
Big Boy's in the house, in the place to be
I don't know why I'm saying these old simple last rhymes
But anyway, I'm Kickin back with some friends of mine
That's louis, E-man, and Kanye, Can't Forget Ricky
That's the man that's on the microphone
Thats the man thats on the turntables, Willing and able

I don't where to start, I don't where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the, Maybe the flow
Maybe the ’Go, where i was grow
Where I grew up in, Where you could see
When my momma divorced my daddy and we moved down 
When we was three, in the cold
Straight from Chicago, where I go
And everybody know
From my homie Don C, I be eh
Ay yo, like IBM
Or Apple Steve Jobs, or this
Yeah, I'm on my job with this
Ay yo its very very simple
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel
I can do it in every tempo, I use my temple
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build Churches
That could be as big as the Adams Family, where it lurches
Ay yo, this is not a circus
The zoo is closed motherfucker
Ay yo, it ain't no
No cursing in the versing, what you know is not perfect
And you know its still worth it
I might short circuit
I might just blackout
Hit you with that blakka, you know I'm the rocker
Number one Chief rocker, Number one Chief rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop em', ain't nobody gon' stop us because
I got God on my side, thats the way I ride
Jesus  Christ
Yeezus Christ
Yeezus nice",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-power-106-freestyle-lyrics
Freestyle from Before Infamous Accident,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now what if Michael Jordan decided to stick to baseball and Jay-Z decided to stick to crack
Just Blaze decided to stick to engineering and Kanye never decided to rap?
What if a nigga from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word
'Cept the nigga's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
But kept in mind as long as  folks and niggas is dead broke
Some things they gone never change
But it ain't them  folks, it's the white folks that brought us over here with boats and tight ropes
But don't forget it was  niggas cause
The kings got rid of us, they selling a crackhead soap
Now follow me, sometimes I feel like dream is subtitles
Say things that mean things but hide them in club titles
So you'll hear something real but think that it's meaningless
Like, ""Damn, I know I feel but I don't know what the meaning is!""
See that there's what make it so ingenious
And that's why Kweli never was lenient
Cause he know what I got, know I was making it hot

Someone in my life who wouldn't touch me
Opened up the bible one day, I know he loves me

You did a thou in a month, wow
Y'all niggas want credit, but y'all need to slow down

How your wife gon' say she never sold drugs a day in her life
But she still wanna pump the yay
And y'all mad cause y'all not knowin'
Cause these canaries so yellow

Tats showin', tucked in, strap showin'

Three in the front, two in the back, two in that back, back
While you in that hatchback and tryin' to sell work
And don’t get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studio gon' give you your daps back
And try to get published
And all you get is your ass capped and that’s that


I just bought my mom a new car and a house
And that's a lot to say for a college dropout
I drove to New York with ten dollars to my name
And brought back a couple platinum plaques on the plane
And brought back that soul shit that changed the game
They have no beat, they had to aim the stain, the steel
Got lizards in my R. Kelly strain
They real, man, I swear to God I wish I had a dollar bill
For every time a nigga told me, ""Stick to the beats""
I could've ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week
I got killed these niggas on that lyrical shit

We can shape our future. I'm an optimist at my core. I know there will be harmony

Art is the threat to authority

what makes kids so important to learn from psychologically is that they are not afraid to fail
What would you do today if you are not afraid of the consequences of failure?
We’re all kids
or at least we're dying to be kids
Or we’re dying because we've lost our inner child
we're dying to be ourselves

"Slavery Was a Choice Pt. 2 [May 1, 2018]",UnKnown,2018.0,"we need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain
to make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will
My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved
They cut out our tongues so we couldn't communicate to each other.  I will not allow my tongue to be cut
Kanye vs the media is modern day Willie Linch theory.
they hung the most powerful in order to force fear into the others.
they can no longer stop our voice.
the Nat Turner movie never made it anywhere because it showed slaves revolting. I understand why my god brother Puff calls his network revolt.
if this was 148 years ago I would have been more like Harriet or Nat
the universe has a plan. I knew that TMZ would be awesome.
we are programmed to always talk and fight race issues. We need to update our conversation.
the reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years. We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought        It was just an idea
once again I am being attacked for presenting new ideas
in school we need to learn how magic Johnson built his business not always about the past. Matter fact I've never even heard of a high school class that presents future ideas
when the media masses and scholars talk about what started today. Here's a title ...

Harvard Design Speech,UnKnown,UnKnown,"So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn’t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!
But I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be “architected.” And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized
If I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way
And I know that there’s more creativity to happen. And I know that there’s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there’s people in offices that stop the creative people, and  are intimidated by actual good ideas
I believe that utopia is actually possible—but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician—I’m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys’ willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation
I’m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it—um, I’m a bit self conscious because I’m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it. It’s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that. And that’s basically all I have to say so thank you very much",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-harvard-design-speech-lyrics

3rd thing    I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word Nigga
5th  thing I’m not even gone take credit for the idea… it’s actually something Taylor came up with …
She was having dinner with one of our friends who’s name I will keep out of this and she told him
I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!  #FACTS
6th  Stop trying to demonize real artist     Stop trying to compromise art
That’s why music is so fucking watered down right now
I miss that DMX feeling
7th  I miss that feeling  so that’s what I want to help restore
8th   They want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
but you can see at Madison Square Garden that you can stop us

Kanye West Talks Fashion and Surprise Concerts in Paris,UnKnown,UnKnown,"PARIS — Fashion has a new odd couple: Bernard Arnault and Kanye West
The luxury titan turned out Saturday night for an impromptu concert by West in the auditorium of his Fondation Louis Vuitton, the new Frank Gehry art destination that later this month will put on display Edvard Munch’s “The Scream,” Henri Matisse’s “Dance” and other modern masterpieces
West drew a crowd packed in like sardines — the kind that hold cell phones — to hear him proclaim, “I wanna thank my original family for having me this evening, the LVMH group,” as he ripped into a version of “Runaway,” the lyrics of which include the refrain, “Let’s have a toast to the jerk-offs/That’ll never take work off.”
The young crowd went wild, with Oscar-winning film director and video artist Steve McQueen twirling his scarf over his head up in the VIP box
“He’s great,” Arnault said after the show, giving a thumbs-up sign and heading to West’s dressing room to offer congratulations, his classical pianist wife Hélène and four of his five children in tow
It was Alexandre Arnault, 22, formerly a DJ, who pulled off the four-night attraction in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. “We organized it in two days,” he said
The student and budding luxury executive, who already works on LVMH’s digital strategy, related that West also offered to premiere his new music video, “All Day,” directed by McQueen
“You saw the film? Fantastic,” Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie Nickerson
McQueen related how the project came about
“Me and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, ‘I’m at Dover Street Market, where are you?’ and I said, ‘Hey, I’m at Dover Street Market,’” he recalled. “I always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That’s Kanye: It’s been a wild ride.”
The director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, “So Help Me God,” and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-tops
In an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity
“As a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn’t been for my experience in Paris — learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,” said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. “It’s part of the show,” he pleaded
While a divisive figure in fashion — many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior — West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people “that work here, the city itself, the music that’s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.”
West’s ties to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009
More recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included “All of the Lights” and “Ni–as in Paris.”
A tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. “When I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,” West said
Tickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charity
Meanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after
“He fully got the color right. And it’s so perfect, I’m like, ‘Don’t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,’” she said with a smile. “I’m happy with it. It’s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, ‘Huh, what’s going on?’”
Kardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration
“I’ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair. They’ve been on my computer forever, ” she said, letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign, but clammed up on the brand
Like West, Kardashian keeps a rein on her image, noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert, which she took off as the heat intensified, was a Céline style she altered to her liking, making it slimmer, changing the color from white to black, and adding a fur collar
“My mom has the one that’s just as is. So I feel like mine’s a little special,” she said
“And now it’s a really dope coat,” West concurred",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-west-talks-fashion-and-surprise-concerts-in-paris-lyrics

Cause every time I talk freely they attack me
They give me backlash, backlash, backlash

Where Princess Diana was killed by the damn fame
The lonely king, who's only flaw is
Looking for somebody that's flawless

That act right makes everything slow

One of those nights where everything goes
Everybody goes through something
People be talking to you like you nothing
Then you be like bitch I'm me
Then your boss be like bitch then leave
You covered up your tats too long with them sleeves
You've gotta hit the club let the real you breathe
Would you believe, you'll never shine if you're not seen
So get all in they face like Noxzema
I know you mesmerized about that ass in them jeans
Please don't hit that raw, it's not clean
Please don't forget that all when it seems

Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore

Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness

If you made plans or not
If God put me in ya plans or not

But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me

The Making of “Ye Vs The People”,UnKnown,2018.0,"Like these is all super pretty things that make you feel everything is safe
I got my polo shirt, I got my horse, it's all good
I got my cross on me

I agree, but I just think that when you have lives lost
As artists, that gives us an obligation to stand up against all of that kinda shit

You know, me putting the hat on forces an evolution because
There's, even for me, I know so much more in the past 3 days
Because I'm getting this energy, positive or negative
Agreeing with me, disagreeing with me
It's like, and that like sharpens the diamond, that shit
Our mind, our conscienceness the way we're thinking
Just breaking some shit

Your intentions, from what you tell me, are pure
But the direction that you took to get there is a bit unorthodox
And kind of... I would say - some people would say thoughtless

If I had not done what I felt and I just thought
Then it would've just never happened
And when I wear that hat it's like a fight for equality
Like ""oh I can wear this hat too""
I think people get mad at me when I name my idols
And I don't say Michael Jordan, I say Disney

I just want you to consider all the people who just might be terribly, like, just torn apart and hurt

I really wanna take that hurt off of them and let them understand that I did not wear that hat to hurt them
Half the shit Trump does, I don't agree with

What half do you agree with?
Let's get that out

Just the ability to do what no one said you could do
To do the impossible is the most inspiring thing to me

Did you play that umm, the one that said
""Tell Daddy what you learned in school""
(You wanna play with that, boy?)
I wanna play with that, yeah

""I was in debt and the car that broke
The same shit I've been saying for years they called it ""loc""
Successful man, a man that  the 
The most successful man the one's who can afford the most mistakes
And play with them""

You could mix into that cause I basically gave a lotta my side on that

Sure

You know what I'm saying?
And your shit come in, you say
""Whoa whoa whoa, what you say?
How could that be?
""
You know what I'm saying?
The exact conversation we're having
And what would you say?

Sure
""Yeah I'm just trying to figure where you're trying to go with this
Some things you don't align with and some shit you just don't go against""
That would kinda , you know

Let me hear it bro, let me see what we got here


""... you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down""

""... know everybody emotional
""Would it be better if I rapped about selling crack?
Because it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, or I'm fuckin' rich?""
Or uhh, I could fuck your bitch

Blood on the Leaves - VMA Performance 2013,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Http://www.schaulager.org/smq/files/lynching_tree.jpg
This performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song
Blood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: ""Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees."" The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community
West performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It’s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience’s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America
Http://divaartist.com/divablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot_2013-08-26-00-20-13_1.jpg
After the performance West posted a picture of the tree captioned: ""those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree.""
Https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1377548967_JKYK1ZZ.jpg
This nuanced imagery, rife with symbolism, paints a powerful and disturbing scene that adds potency to West’s message of the relics of slavery in today's society",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-blood-on-the-leaves-vma-performance-2013-lyrics

For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne titter....
Chi-Town what's going on man
(Verse 1)
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a Delta so she been throwing them dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah
(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin' to have a plate on my chin

So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it

You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I'm saying is we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too. But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think?  Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi. Radio, fuck you! Oh yeah, I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Radio, fuck you. Yeah, I’m taking his lead. I’mma just say how I say, be ‘Ye, and win. I’mma take his lead. Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Eh, is it, “Radio, fuck you? That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly
Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over. I was raised by KMS 1, I was raised by Tribe Called Quest, I was raised by DMX. The last real nigga alive? Naw, nigga! We real niggas alive, we alive tonight, bruh! We alive tonight, bruh! Virgil Abloh is alive tonight, bro. A$AP Nast is alive tonight, bro.  Bari is alive tonight, bro. Ian Connor is alive tonight, bro.  Rocky alive tonight, bro. Aye, y’all love my show. When I say these names, y’all better scream for me. I don’t give a fuck if you know the names or not, go ahead, Google them. They will give you a little bit of factual information. They will give you that. Why did I name A$AP? Because that’s the future. That’s the niggas they got me and Cudi on our toes like that. These these niggas keeping this shit alive bro, These these niggas keeping this shit alive bro. It’s life
We’ve got a hundred years out here, a hundred years on this planet, bro, and we can have a utopia. We can love each other. But the rules gotta be fair. Khaled and Drake and radio and Doc and  92.3 and everybody. Is it just me or did you hear that song so many times “you say you wanna play for free.” Aye, aye. You know what it is, though? Because aye, I love Drake. I love Khaled. But they set that song up, bro. And let me tell you something: MTV, fuck you! Once again, as always. I’m on my Trump shit tonight. Let me tell you what it is, bruh. Aye, you know me. I went down seven years of my life of motherfuckers hating me for saying Beyoncé had the best video. Hey, baby, let’s rock and roll tonight. Y’all might be experiencing a lot of pop shit, but the vibes is back. The prodigal son, Kid Cudi, has returned. The vibes is back. I know it’s going to be a lot of conversations after tonight
Khaled, I know you got killers in Miami, please do not send them at my head. I just want to have a conversation about how we playing radio’s game. Khaled, you a real nigga. Khaled, you a real nigga. You got the keys. But as we learn all the politics that niggas was doing for years. Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was. Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this  and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change shit, bro. Being perfect don’t always change shit, bro
So, when I talk about MTV, let me explain something. I was hurt, Beyoncé, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called “Fade” and out of respect MTV told me, ""Mr. West out of respect to you, I will let you know that Beyoncé is winning the video tonight for “Formation” over “Hotline Bling” and “Famous.”"" They told me beforehand so I wouldn’t run on stage. Ayy bro, y’all ain’t gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision and you know I’mma gonna keep it real with you. Beyoncé, I was hurt. I went down seven years on behalf of your—eh, nigga! Don’t throw no shit while I'm talking. I am putting my career, my life, my public well-standing at risk when I talk to y’all like this. This is a moment in the The Matrix, bro. The vibes is back. The vibes is back. Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight. Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over “Hotline Bling.” In my opinion—now, don’t go trying to diss Beyoncé. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal, but sometimes, we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh!
I’ve been sent here to give y’all my truth, even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success, my own career. I’ve been sent here to give y’all the truth. Jay Z, call me, bruh. You still ain’t call me. Jay Z, call me. Aye bruh, I know you got killers, please don’t send them at my head. Just call me. Talk to me like a man. I’m not trying to be ""the man"", I just am ""a man"", the same as anybody here. I ain’t above, below none of y’all. We all equal. We all equal. These is the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to Make America Great Again. Ha! You didn’t like that! Guess what? Guess what? Y’all need the vibes. I was hurt. Feelings matter, bro. The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins. Feelings matter, bro. Feelings matter, bro
It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world. Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bro. It’s a new world. It’s a new world, Barack! It’s a new world, Jay Z! Aye, don’t send killers at my head, bro! This ain’t the Malcolm X movie, we growing from that moment. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Oh wait a second. Do y’all agree with that? Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye! Wait a second - I ain’t hear enough screams on that. Let ‘Ye be ‘Ye!
People I'm not saying this out of my own well-being because it wouldn’t be smart out of my own well-being to say things like this. Radio, I done talked to you a bunch of motherfucking times. Y’all motherfuckers is behind the times. Because guess what, the Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening. The Saint Pablo tour is more relevant than radio! And if y’all keep following old models, your ass is going to be Hillary Clinton'd. You might not like it, but they gotta hear it. I ain’t here to massage you with a fake truth, telling you that Hillary gon’ win over and over and over, then you wake up  you still can’t believe it! You know why? Because you was lied to by Google! You was lied to by Mark Zuckerberg!
Mark Zuckerberg, you wanna call me now? Do I got the vision, Mark Zuckerberg? Was you wrong? When I said I was $53 million in debt and you didn’t call me, was you wrong? You ate dinner, you asked my friend Anthony Schiller to have dinner with me. I told you about DONDA. You said you would help and you didn’t. Then you went to look for aliens. Me and Kid Cudi are aliens right here, bro. The vibes is back.  Ayy John - Take it all the way back to the beginning. Shia LaBeouf, Kid Cudi feels a way, give him a call
Q-Tip, I love you, bro, don’t tell me how to be me, though. I love you. The Tribe album is dope. I love you. Don’t tell me how to be me, though. I’ve been me. I am me. There’s a Richard Pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power. That’s happened with musicians because they’re scared. I’m not scared. I’m here to change things. I am here to change things. And things won't change until people admit they own falsehoods. I got the visions, bro. That’s what I’ve been blessed with, my vision. I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I’m going to say how I feel. Right now, I will prepare - right now, press get ready to write your passive-aggressive, LeBron James, racist comments. Season 4, racist comments. Get ready to have a field day, press! Get ready, get ready, 'cause the show’s over. ",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-sacramento-rant-full-transcript-lyrics

The Daily’s Fashion Los Angeles Awards Speech,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You know, one connection that I have, you know, to, I believe everyone in this room, but especially with like me and Virgil and Don C and Fonzworth Bentley and all the people from the infamous Tommy Ton then transferred to South Park photo. Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that’s my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. . “You’re my M.A.S. and I’m your Nicholas.” And her brother’s a doctor. And somehow in her family she’s looked at like she didn’t do as much  in her life ‘cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit together
And I honest.. I’mma jump to a point just so I don’t take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I’m a Christian, I’m not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we’re extension of doing his work on Earth. While we’re here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they’re higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, “oh, you’re a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.” No knock to lawyers, but you know what I’m talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, “I wanna be in the middle of that conversation.” Nah, I’m saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, “you think you not part of fashion because you don’t datatata.” Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let’s make the conversation, you know, let’s make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl’s’ or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currency
When we talk about, you know, I was talking to Rassi earlier and he was saying, you know, what his background was and you know, the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like, to just being in America and being able to create. And I told him he had to arm wrestle with Virgil on like who is the greatest guy that I knew ‘cause he’s definitely one of the top. You know, one of these times when I look at like him and say “wow,” you know, I wish I could interact with people in the way that he interacts. I wish that I could believe in people unselfishly without, you know, worrying about how it may affect me, affects my reputation blabla, or all of what fashion is. Because I think that’s word fashion insiders, but everyone’s a fashion insider, you know. It’s illegal to be naked, everyone has some form of fashion, every single day. And I think it’s, the point I wanna make before I bring ‘em up, because I wanted to make this point to this room really.. you know, we have the power to change the world. I believe that through design ‘cause design is the closest to truth. Problem solving, truth is the closest to love, love is the closest thing to God and God is love. But we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying, “Kanye you can’t get in this show ‘cause you’re a celebrity” or some shit like that. You know, the way we embrace celebrity, the way, what Miley’s had to go through in the past couple years. Dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that. I’m not gonna give you guys the speech that Tarantino gave at the Lacma, I’mma say what the fuck he should’ve really said, you know. The old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard. I don’t even know if I made one fucking good point
But what I wanna say is, this guy let me, a celebrity designer, work at Milk Studio when Adidas couldn’t figure out where my office was. We didn’t have windows, you know, it was cool, you know. We’d go out and get a cup of coffee, we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway. And I promised him that I was gonna be fucking good. It wasn’t about me being a celebrity ‘cause it could’ve been like, “what do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at Milk Studio? This is very authentic, blablabla..” All the shit. And he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit, you know, waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest American to run a French house called Balenciaga. That he believed in that kid back then, believing in, spending everything on Alexander Wang. And, I’m closing now. I don’t move, I don’t leave my fucking crib unless I really believe in someone. I don’t read the teleprompters blablabla. And I’m so happy that Jeremy is here ‘cause Jeremy asked me to come here also and Jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself. I’m not gonna say shit else. So all I’mma say is, I fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian, as a visionary and as an innovator: Rassi",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-the-dailys-fashion-los-angeles-awards-speech-lyrics

Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit

Bought the chain that always give me back pain

Khaled, you a real nigga, you got the keys. But as we learn all the politics, and niggas was doing for years, Obama couldn't make America great, because he couldn't be him, to be who he was.
Black men have been slaves, Obama wasn't allowed to do this, *screech*, and still win. He had to be perfect, but being perfect don't always change shit bro. Being perfect don't always change shit bro.
So when I'm talking about MTV -- Let me explain something. I was hurt. Beyonce, I was hurt because I wanted to present a video called ""Famous"", and out of respect, MTV told me ""Mr. West, I don't respect you. I will let you know that Beyonce is winning the video tonight, for formation, over Hotline Bling and Famous."" They told me beforehand so I wouldn't run on stage. Ay bruh, y'all ain't gotta fuck with me, but you know I got the vision, and you know I'mma keep it real with you.
Beyonce, I was hurt, I went down 7 years on behalf of yo --
Ay nigga, don't throw no shit when I'm talkin'!
I am putting my career, my life, my public well standing, at risk when I talk to y'all like this. This is the moment in the Matrix, bro, the  is back! The  is back!
Motherfuckers might feel a way about this tonight. Beyonce, I was hurt, 'cause I heard that you said you wouldn't perform unless you won Video Of The Year over ME, and over Hotline Bling.  In my opinion -- Now don't go trying to diss Beyonce. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes, we be playing the politics too much, and forgetting who we are, just to win. Fuck winning. Fuck looking cool. Fuck looking cool. Fuck being cool. Fuck all that, bruh!
I been sitting here, to give y'all my truth, even at the risk of my own life. Even at the risk of my own success. My own career. I been sitting here, to give y'all the truth. JAY Z, call me bruh. You still ain't called me!
JAY Z call me, Ay bruh, I know you got killers, don't send 'em at my head! Just call me! Talk to me like a man.
I'm trying to be THE man, I just am A man. The same as everybody in here. I ain't above, below, none of y'all. We all equal. We all equal. These are the vibes, bro. This is the future. This is the way of thinking to Make America Great Again. Hahaha, ayo, you like that. Guess what? Guess what? Y'all need the vibes. I was hurt, feelings matter. The way motherfuckers put money up so high, popularity, radio spins, feelings matter bruh. Feelings matter bruh. It's a new world, Hillary Clinton. It's a new world. Feelings matter. 'Cause guess what? Everybody in middle-America felt a way, and they showed you how they felt. Feelings matter, bruh. It's a new world. It's a new world, Barrack. It's a new world, JAY Z. Ay, don't send killers at my head, this ain't the Malcom X movie, we growing from that moment. Let 'Ye be 'Ye. Oh wait a second, do y'all agree with that? Let 'Ye be 'Ye! Wait a second, I ain't hearing no screams on that. Let 'Ye be 'Ye. People, I'm not saying this out of my own well being, because it wouldn't be smart out of my own well being to say things like this.

I have millions of ideas and I represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world. I don't call myself a designer as I was not allowed to go to Saint Martin's because I was too famous by the time I realized I wanted to design. Fame is often looked down upon in the design world so it's actually been something I had to overcome. All we have are our dreams and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want but we won't stop fighting. We want to innovate and we will win someday.

I want the X-Men around me, Malcolm X could use

A Million In One,The Graduate,2007,"OKAY, I RELOADED! (The League Crew!)
Yeah
It's (a million)

I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul, bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone, bout (a million)
Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's (a million), uh-uh
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million...)

Lot of people ask about the money I made, even Just Blaze
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Rappers I met, or, delt with direct
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
What's the position you hold?
Could you really master Neptunes, check my check, and ""H to the Izzo"", the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-fella shit, fold, and you move back to the ""Go""
Is it back to Ghost producer for D-dot on the low?
For the million time asking me
Questions like Toni Braxton, harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard ""Takeover"", who running this rap shit?
Uggh, fake tits, shut up and make hits
Can't we all just get along, spread love, like ""take six""?
What, you doing beats in LA for Eminem and Dr Dre?
Them niggas sold ten mil, I'm trying to get paid
We do this shit for entertainment, bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber, let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!

How many years did I wait, about (a million)
How many niggas tryna hate, about (a million)
But when a nigga count his cake, it's like (a million)

All for the College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffing
'Ye still flicking, hoes is my addiction
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
Snatching the game, nigga, unlike you
Cause these beats change the game, and the hook's right too
I'm unquick like you
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap, man, what could I do?
Knowing I s'posed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
Bout to beat on Oprah, now
It's ironic and whatnot
How I put no ice on the Bulgari watch, just to make it hot
Now you see me on stages, my hit resumes is
Two pages for them niggas who played us
Features, raise us, booming like Master Aces
Stand up, number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
While y'all brick like Fred, Barney, Rubble and them
Chi-town in this bitch, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing, BLAOW!

Better than a chick that say ""Yes"" too soon
Until you have a daughter; that’s what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that’s how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?
Get they first car and then, IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend, ""Was the strip clubs cool?
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?""
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain’t in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me

You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up
And watch how we roll up, and
I can't control it, I can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff puff, then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotiq for Henny? Now, nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nothing to something, now, pimping, that's a savior
Best things are green, now, pimpin', get your paper
High off the ground, from stair to skyscraper
Cool out, thinking we local, c'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major
We major? C'mon, homie, we major

It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go (Ooh-ooh), still nowhere to go (Ooh-ooh)

One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that

Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop playa-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words: ""fuck you, pay me""
Screamin', ""Jesus, save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me

Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?

Sorry for the night demons that still visit me

But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Now Linda love lace like Linda love lace
LaFace says she like +Mase+ but she love +Face+
And I know that Linda was a hip-hop-head
And I know that Linda gave Hip-Hop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I ain't here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She ain't hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin gr-green, she was like ""ch-ching""
Got em, but she know a rreeal nigga when she, spot him
So now she's pickin dresses from Veroraiyn
Scratchin out her maiden and here's my name
Now I'm sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin ""Cheers to you for your future years of pain""
Like ""Dog you ready to give all this shit up?
The summer's on its way and these hoes doin sit-ups
And when they see the way the G-5 lights lit up
Your gonna wanna have two like John Ritter""
But naww, I bought her a brand new BM
He said ""Dog, slow down like Brand Nubian now""

I just feel the need to purge my soul from the work load
Couldn't watch another nigga get burnt slow
She said her man was busy, always bored her with work load
Never takes her out and falls asleep in his work clothes
She needs some excitement, which leads to this indictment
Believe what you like kid, according to her
When we recorded with her, Linda changed her name to Nicky
Sang along to Darlin Nicky, co-star of my quickies
That foot is so pretty, but I'm sure you recognize
That bra holds titties, those are her titties
Solar's so pretty, but not to rub it in
But that white Russian did make her lonely like the wind
So the over right that's in, on the over night depends
If you take heed the game, and please keep ya name, word

Cuz she's just a playa playa
That's playin games wit me

I can't see myself getting out the game, no time soon

My name is Summer . I’d like to say that the issue with education is that it is whitewashed and not only white-washed, it is washed over by whoever is the victor. So that people who are marginalized in any community, not just necessarily people of color…

I know that we are trained to emotionally react to the points that are said, to say Mm-hmm I feel that"" or ""Mm-hmm, I feel that"". But today, I want you guys to try, not to try, because trying is failing. What I want you guys to do is show how we can have complete silence until she expresses her point completely. And when she is done and says, ""I...I...We have fully expressed ourselves"" because I don’t love the word, I. Which I get the .
When she says, We have completely expressed our point… who is that?
()
You can’t hear? Can we close those two Malcolm X doors in the back?
You see where the two exits are? Is it okay to close the doors, but keep them unlocked, while we’re talking? I think it can help with the sound. Moving forward, we will be in rooms where the acoustics will be absolutely incredible because I will be involved in the design.

Summer…Summer has an expression about education. Summer go ahead, now what I’m saying is no camera flicks, no flashes, no moving, no opening up Doritos bags. All right Summer, let’s go.

Okay, so the problem with education that I was saying is, people are marginalized, they’re not teaching all of history. They’re only teaching it from one perspective, which is the victor's perspective. That’s not always the right perspective and I feel like if we’re able to include other people into the perspective and into the conversation, it’ll teach the generation coming up how to be more inclusive, how to respond to situations. It’ll teach people how to love each other.
There’s just so much wrong with education, some people don’t know so many things, not only just in high school, in college, in the jail systems, everywhere. So many people don’t know, after you come out of jail, you still have the right to vote. A lot of people don’t know that. There’s so much wrong with the education that we can’t keep up with…

, history.
Summer’s going to speak on police brutality also. She has another expression she needs to make.

Is that okay with you guys?

Yes!

Wait a second. It doesn’t have to be okay with you guys because I stated that she was going to do that…
Quiet down for a second because the problem is, we only have made moves that we are generally okay with not understanding that Instagram has been controlling the opinions of what we are okay with.

Yes!

So, me as the leader of the free world, it's time for the very first round.

Yes!

Inside of the very first rally.  I’ve made a decision that Summer is going to express her feelings and information on police brutality. Silence please.

Okay, so my feelings on police brutality is not everyone should be allowed onto the police force, first of all. So many people are on the police force that shouldn’t be in the police force. They just want to have authority in action and power. Not only that, what he was saying about brainwashing, obviously he’s right. He’s Kanye West.
 social media is brainwashing people, stuff like TikTok. TikTok is brainwashing little kids. People are on here at 3 years old watching TikTok.

Pause, pause. If you guys want to whisper, go outside and talk. We need absolute silence, we need absolute order. That is the only way for this country to be back in order. And for us to have absolute order, respect, dignity, and honor for those that we showed up in here and that are speaking. Summer is talking right now, if you see someone next to you that nudges you or tries to whisper. Hold your hand and say, this person is distracting me from what Summer is saying right now, and we will have them escorted out.
Now Summer, go ahead.

So on the topic of brainwashing, just everything brainwashes us now. Social media, if they want something, they can program it into our minds. TV, social media, literally everything and the state of the nation is just it’s in complete dismay.
Summer: (06:04)
There’s one cop that feels like everything is okay, there’s one out that feels like everything is in tatters. And I wish everyone can just come together, respect everyone’s opinions. You don’t have to agree with them, but you can always respect their opinion and that’s how I feel. I have expressed what I needed to say.
Kanye West: (06:04)
Raise your hand silently if you have another issue that you would like to bring up. I saw your hand first.
Lauren: (06:04)
My name is Lauren McLeod.
Kanye West: (06:04)
This is Lauren McLeod.
Kanye West: (08:43)
I understand everyone is excited, it’s a new world. You have someone who is not afraid of anyone and only afraid of God and in honor to God…we have someone who isn’t afraid of anyone and in honor to God and is at a 132 I.Q. genius that literally went to the hospital because his brain was too big for his skull and literally…Absolutely no clapping. That went to Adidas when it was 50 billion dollar organization losing two billion dollars and ended up at 62 billion dollars before COVID that went to the stock market with GAP and whose net worth went from 3.3 billion to 5 billion in 45 minutes. Now, that his friends, I only have one superhero friend right now, who is that? . Okay, so we have one member of the superhero avenger team, so far. So I know that this is an exciting movement, but we’re not excited because if I told you that I bought you a brand new Mercedes Benz and it’s outside, you’d run to the car. But if I was society today, I wouldn’t have the car directly outside, I’d have it on the other side of the street. So you’d get hit by a car trying to run to your new car.
Kanye West: (09:32)
And that’s what social media…Quiet. That’s what social media does. It gets you excited about things. It gets you turned up about things. It gets you running around and I’m just walk…I don’t know where these bricks come from, but I’m going to use them.
Kanye West: (09:33)
Wait a second, where did the bricks come from though? Did you put the bricks in the street?
Audience: (09:33)
No.
Kanye West: (09:33)
Did you put the bricks in the street? I’m not talking about the riots, I’m talking about the bricks in the 80s.
Audience: (09:33)
Oh.
Kanye West: (09:33)
We’re ready.
Lauren: (10:07)
Education is an important topic. Education…
Kanye West: (10:09)
We have no microphone.. You got it.
Lauren: (10:09)
Education starts everything. Education starts people who are in our police force, in our healthcare force, in our political force. So, if we’re not educated properly, how can we live in America if we don’t even have the education to live in America. I grew up in Tulsa. I grew up right here surrounded by white people. There’s nothing wrong with white people, but you live with a whole different perspective than everybody else. I lived with a whole different perspective than everybody else and we need to change everything, so we can begin to change.
Lauren: (10:42)
, with people in our society. And I think healthcare is so important because if people don’t have access to healthcare, how can people live their life? How can you live your life if you don’t feel comfortable going to the doctor’s, don’t feel comfortable going to vote, if you’re not able to go and vote?
Kanye West: (11:09)
Okay, so I stubbed my toe. Two years ago. And went to the doctor because you know I’ve got to , I got to take everything quite serious. I’m not just going to take some ointment or whatever, I’m going to go to the hospital. So, when I got there, 5 doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year, they give out awards for people who have given out the most medication.
Kanye West: (11:26)
In Europe, there’s a higher threshold for pain. I got plastic surgery to try to look young and try to look like I needed to be on TV out in Los Angeles. You heard a small clip of that on TMZ. After getting the plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to being addicted to Percocet.
Kanye West: (11:34)
Percocet released serotonin and endorphins in your mind that are similar to when you have an orgasm and are also a cousin and a sister of heroin. So, basically, some could say I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. And I would live in this  mansion in the state of community with my Maybach and I would drive to Calabasas high as a motherf***er. That’s the one that my dad is sitting at home waiting for Fox News to run that.
Kanye West: (12:34)
It said he was high as a mother-…No, because I went through a process of one thing leading to the next thing, leading to the next thing, leading to the next…No, because the next thing is the same thing. It’s a cycle. It’s the same thing. We are trapped in a loop. We are going to break that trap.
Kanye West: (12:55)
Uno memento…wait you come here for the next statement…you said can I…who’s the person that said can I ask? You said can I ask something? Okay, you stand up here, I would like for her to finish…”Imma let you finish”
Lauren: (12:55)
Okay, well I have a statement about pride and how it’s different…
Kanye West: (12:55)
About pride.
Lauren: (13:41)
Yeah, different places in the United States are trying to . I grew up in . I repeat . , they would get in trouble for it, but other people wouldn’t. The same thing happens at school, if you get into a fight at school, some people get in trouble. , dropped out of school and straight into jail. But other schools, you can get into a fight and you’re back in class that day or the next day. It’s not a fair . If we don’t acknowledge that, nothing’s going to change. There’s still white people, black people, every single person , truly acknowledge that there is a difference between ways that we’re raised and the way we experience the world.
Lauren: (13:41)
And I think, hey we got celebrities. We have Kanye, but we also have so many other celebrities that represent so many people in the United States and its not fair.
Kanye West: (14:51)
I understand that there was a very, very hopeful moment that you had to experience for four years when I wore the Trump hat for four years. I’m going to explain to you that Democrats ain’t get sh** for blacks. And the most racist thing that’s ever been said out loud is the idea that if Kanye West runs for president, I’m going to split the Black votes.
Kanye West: (14:55)
This reminded me, what was Samuel L. Jackson’s character in Django? .
Kanye West: (14:58)
Stephen…Okay, right, right. I’m not trying to quiet your voices actually. So, I don’t want to say that in an improper way, I just haven’t had the time to word it in the most elegant way possible. So, that’s a Stephen move. When Harriet Tubman, well Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had the slaves go work for other white people.
Kanye West: (15:38)
The National Basketball Association is not owned by any blacks. Universal Music is not owned by any blacks. Any celebrity that you see talking is not the real power.
Kanye West: (16:03)
Talking is not the real power because the real power that I am putting my line on the life today to speak about, you don’t see them. You don’t see the real power. You don’t know who’s putting the Internet near schools just to trap you. You don’t know who’s talking to you. Black women in between the ages of 12 to 21 that follows this person in order to buy this product. You don’t know who’s the head of the boards.
Kanye West: (16:41)
In risk or no risk of losing whatever deal possible, I am not on the board at Adidas. I am not on the board at GAP and that has to change today or I walk away. Because don’t believe that because they put the second woman, not the first on the bus, the first woman…you know that story where I am going right? There was a girl, do you remember her name? Not Rosa Parks. There was a dark skinned woman, what was she 15? 15. She was pregnant out of wedlock, so she couldn’t start the movement. She couldn’t put the bricks in the streets. I don’t know much about George Soros in all honesty. I do not know much about this man, so I will not bear false witness. I need to educate myself more about these. But also these things is, we pinpoint names.
Kanye West: (17:59)
We pinpoint people, we attack each other. We are all equal in God’s eyes. Sometimes, people are controlled by demons. Sometimes, people are controlled by the environment that we are in, but we are all God’s people. There’s no bad people. There are lost people, but we are all God’s people. There’s not left, right, red, blue. That’s why everybody here is purple today. And everyone, I’ve never got next to someone who didn’t get more prosperous because of it. George Soros, I know, know how to make homes in one day. Well, we’re doing the same thing. We’re making homeless shelters, so I would like to meet with George Soros, on that. Mark Zuckerberg would like to bring the Internet into Africa. Okay, well let’s beat Mark Zuckerberg because when you went to Africa, they said no. China is buying land in Africa. Okay, well my deal with Adidas is no longer that I get a 15% royalty, I’m giving them the 15% royalty.
Kanye West: (19:15)
Wait a second, I don’t want to hear…I’ll let you know when I’m finished with my thoughts. And I would prefer 10, I like multiples of 20, but I’m giving them a 15% royalty, but because of their 15% royalty, it made me into a billionaire. Which could make me, on this piece alone, at 0 tomorrow. But when God calls Moses, he has to leave his comfy job working for the Egyptians and free the people. And the freedom does not come from an election. The freedom comes from you not loading up pornography. The freedom comes from you not taking the Percocet. The freedom comes from you not doubting your brother and your sister. The freedom comes from you putting that gun down and not shooting people at the gas station. It has nothing to do with thos election. It only has to do with God and God’s people. He sent pause
Kanye West: (20:24)
He set pause for us to take a moment and breathe and not TikTok ourselves out. He sent pause for us, now we have a moment to breathe. It has nothing to do with black, white, rich, poor, red, blue, Native American, pilgrim. It has to deal with being truthful to what God has.
Kanye West: (20:47)
I see you have your hands up, walk up here, you’re going to get your chance…yes you, young lady walk up here.
Kanye West: (21:05)
Now let me tell you something, I heard you. All right, let me tell you…I’ll talk about Planned Parenthood. So…one more minute sir we can talk. I’m going to have my talk and then I’m going to do Planned Parenthood.
Kanye West: (21:09)
So…  most likely speak Spanish here. No… we’re going to be  most original languages and we, all these people,. So, and there are illegal, so called…, there’s no such thing as an illegal immigrant. People have been working here and supporting the world, then they need the opportunity for the freedom and the state of a…for the country that they’ve worked for. Let me go to Planned Parenthood.
Kanye West: (21:47)
The statement is, in the Bible, its says Thou should not kill. I remember that my girlfriend called me screaming and crying and I was just thinking. Because at that time I was a rapper, I was out there, I had some girlfriends and everything and I just thought to myself I want to word this in a way that, hey I don’t give a f***, I’m going to word it like .
Kanye West: (22:19)
So my girlfriend called me and I just thought to myself, please don’t tell me I get it  that sh** AIDS, that’s going to be rude. Quiet down. Then she said, I’m pregnant. And I said, yes, and then I said, no.
Kanye West: (22:22)
So, I’m going to tell you what was in my mind. She was crying, she said I just came from the doctor, and said Oh my God . Because I was having like a rapper’s lifestyle. So, she said she was pregnant and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her and I having this child. She had the pills in her hand. You know these pills, that if you take it, it’s a wrap, the baby’s gone. So, I was sitting up in Paris and I had my leather pants on.
Kanye West: (23:19)
You already know if you got leather pants on, you already know who this person must think they are, right? And I’m in the apartment where my wife was actually robbed and I had my laptop that got all of my creative ideas. I got my shoes, I got my sound cover, I got communities, I got clothes, I got all this and the screen was black and white. And God said, If you f*** with my vision, I’m going to f*** with yours. And I called my wife and she said we’re going to have this baby. I said we’re going to have this child.
Kanye West: (24:03)
I know people who are 50 years old that didn’t have children. They didn’t have that child. That have never got to experience the level, the level of joy that I’ve experienced in having a child. So even if my wife were to divorce me, after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn’t want to. She stood up and she protected that child.
Kanye West: (24:30)
You know who else protected a child? Who do you think might’ve protected a child? 43 years ago, who protected a child? My mom. My mom saved my life. My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would have been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy.
Kanye West: (24:58)
.
Audience: (24:58)
We love you Kanye.
Kanye West: (24:58)
I almost killed my daughter. I almost killed my daughter.
Kanye West: (28:50)
And then they said to me, You can’t, you can’t tell them about this story, you’re going to lose your drop deal. They made me put a  deal over my daughter. They made me put an Adidas deal over my daughter. They’re going to run this. They’re going to try to tell you that I’m crazy, the world’s crazy. I love my daughter.
Kanye West: (28:50)
My idea…no, no, no. Everyone quiet down. No more Plan B, Plan A. Anyone who is pregnant, you have an option of $50,000 a year that I will support with the organizations that I make, to take care of the child. You have the Plan A option. Are you saying no, you can’t have a Plan A option?
Audience: (28:50)
No.
Kanye West: (28:50)
Calm down everyone. Calm down. Everyone be quiet.
Speaker 1: (28:51)
What about women who got raped? What about women with mental illness?  What about our right to take care of a kid? You want them to take care of a kid? Are you, is that what you’re proposing? $50,000 a year for what? For a crazy lady to take care of a baby?
Kanye West: (28:51)
Now everyone be quiet so you can hear us. . Steve Jobs is adopted. You are adopted. You are adopted. It actually, the whole thing is villages. It takes a village to raise a child. No matter how much money you have, you need grandmothers, you need friends, you need people.
Speaker 1: (28:51)
Single moms with no family. Single moms…
Kanye West: (28:51)
Exactly. Because the society has been set up for single moms to not have a village, to not have a job. . How many people have to drive 45 minutes to get to their job here? So, I moved to a small town in Cody, Wyoming where people can walk. A four-year-old can walk from school to home safely. We, there’s a lot of policies that only relate to what Rockefeller, du Pont, and Cotton set up. You understand what you guys are talking…you guys might want to say in front of me, f*** you Kanye. You realize that I am putting my life on the line for the truth. Right now.
Audience: (28:51)
Yes.
Speaker 1: (28:51)
Kanye, I love you. . You are one of the most creative guys on planet Earth, but I also disagree with you on Planned Parenthood. I don’t think we should get rid of Plan B. I don’t think we should get rid of abortions.
Kanye West: (28:51)
Let me tell you. The Bible says…
Speaker 1: (28:56)
The Bible says a lot of things. The Bible says a lot of things. Jesus had 12 male disciples and that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute..
Kanye West: (29:10)
When I said I had….. Amber Rose. People told me to not date this woman because she was a stripper. There was a lot of comparison to Mary Magdalene. We went to the Vatican together and there was a painting by Raphael and the Christian community might not like this, but there was a smudge next to Jesus at The Last Supper. And the person who showed the painting said, that was Mary. And Amber Rose saw that and started crying. She saw that, that the church tried to erase those who weren’t good enough as they saw it in the world.
Kanye West: (30:06)
Amber started crying when she saw that. That’s what I mean by that. Jesus loved all people. And when people talk about profanity and different things and God wants us to create is what I’m saying. But in the state that we live in right now, we eat meat, I hunt meat. In the Garden of Eden we didn’t have to. In this state right now if someone is raped in the…I understand why someone would make the choice of getting a divorce. I mean getting a divorce , I mean of getting an abortion.
Kanye West: (30:39)
I understand if a person, if a father, is not there. And I’ll be done with this point in about two minutes, let me get it out. I understand if a person is in an impoverished community, why, or if they are impoverished they can’t afford their fifth or sixth or their seventh child, or even their first child. I understand the situation that someone would be in. God would still make it rain. God will make it rain and those people who have never met someone who has said, I had this child and it was the worst thing.
Kanye West: (31:16)
People always say, God made a way. I had this child and it was the best thing. Society has set it up in a way where we feel that God won’t make a way. When I was 53 million dollars in debt, I was in the crazy home and as soon as I say Jesus name out loud, he gave me increase. He gave me a platform, he gave me sanity, he gave me clarity to be able to speak not on the word of Yeezus and Yeso like in a rap, but on the word of Jesus and community and family. So what I’m saying is, we understand, we’re not going to go back to women having to go in an alley and do crazy type of things. We understand the conditions. We understand the conditions of black people in America and why we break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions.
Kanye West: (32:03)
Break every store that’s there. We understand the conditions of women in America. We understand that we live in a white supremacist world, and until that is equalized, people stand on rights that make them more equal. The idea of a woman having a choice, I understand because it says “Hey, I can do this stuff.”
Kanye West: (32:24)
When a black man breaks, gets mad, raps, plays ball, wears gold chains. I got gold teeth. My bottom teeth are removed for my gold teeth, and partially it’s because I can do that.  So I understand the risk. And here goes the liberals, “He compared abortion to gold teeth.” Hey, let me explain something to liberals, though.
Georgia: (33:00)
What are you? Nothing? 
Kanye West: (33:07)
I am Christian, but also I am a listener. You cannot lead without listening. This is the reason… What’s your name? This is the reason why Georgia, where I was born, must express their self. People saw me put up a tweet where I showed the six month baby.
Speaker 2: (33:18)
Why’d you delete it?
Kanye West: (33:24)
Because I was pressured by the forces that were around me. Now what I’m saying is, I’ve even heard that they can abort a baby up to eight months, but I wanted to show everyone… In the same way when I got into a car accident, and I showed a picture of my face, I wanted to show everyone exactly what the six month baby that is legal to be destroyed in  looked like. And then I got social media backlash. Bot, I backstroke the backlash.
Kanye West: (34:00)
What I want to say is, I understand with where we are today, why if a woman was raped, why… You see, but the thing is, let me give you an example. Women love My Body, My Choice. That is a great example.  Does anyone know  TMZ.
Speaker 2: (34:23)
F*** TMZ!
Kanye West: (34:23)
 quiet down, right? So let’s say when the baby is conceived, at that point it is a soul. It is a real, living thing. That six month year old baby, that’s a real living thing. Do we agree that that was a real baby? That six month old baby?
Audience: (34:35)
Yeah.
Kanye West: (34:37)
Okay, so My Body, My Choice. Say we were to separate with the baby’s mama and y’all had an argument, and you got a one year old. Be like, basically um, 18 months older than the tweet I sent out. Y’all get in an argument and she says, “My house, my choice. I’m going to kill your child.” You know what I’m saying? Because when a baby is accepted, it is real. It is real at that point, says I. I don’t give a f*** if I win presidency or not. You know what I’m saying? I’m not here to .
Kanye West: (35:23)
I care that it’s homeless people in front of the Gucci store. I care that it’s people that are put in situations where they will never know how much  because the way society sets things up. I care about these things and I am in service to God. I don’t know, I’m like an employee  this weekend. Nothing will happen to me because God has the plan for us, as his people, to be finally free. 
Kanye West: (35:34)
How do we disobey? When we kill, we disobey. How else do we disobey?
Speaker 2: (35:34)
When we steal.
Georgia: (35:34)
When we lie.
Kanye West: (35:34)
When we steal. How else?
Georgia: (35:34)
When we lie.
Kanye West: (35:34)
Lie.
Audience: (35:34)
Cheat.
Kanye West: (36:06)
When we cheat. When we not love our neighbor. These are these things. Politics, America, Trump, Biden, nor Kanye West can free us. The only thing that can free us is by obeying the rules that were given to us for a promised land.  I don’t think the last…  a woman who stood up here and we have the perspective of so many women in the world. You get the last word.
Audience: (36:53)
 Talk up!  
Kanye West: (37:19)
Wait, wait, wait. Everybody, if everyone just got quiet while Georgia talks, this would be over right now. And if this is over right now, guess what else is over right now? I’m over. And if I’m over right now, guess what else is over. The country’s over right now. Everyone pay the same respect to Georgia that you paid to me. She openly opened up to you guys, to me, on a platform and said she had an abortion a few months ago. And her maternal instincts were that she wanted to have the baby, but she felt she couldn’t support the baby on $9 minimum wage.
Georgia: (38:04)
I just think my . I don’t think we should say .
Kanye West: (38:20)
Let me explain something to you guys. My stance is not to make abortion illegal at all. It should always be legal, but there should be an option of maximum increase for . Abortion should be legal, because guess what? The law is not by God even. So what’s legality? 30 states still execute men that did not do the crime that they are being executed for, and modern day mass incarceration is slavery. In 2020, abortion should be legal, but the option of maximum increase should be available. 
Kanye West: (39:14)
Maximum increase would be everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars, or something like that.  Oh, wait, wait. Says the person that’s worked five . We would fund it from other countries. With other continents. There are Israeli continents that you do not believe. There are African continents that, the African continent, the continent of Africa. Israel and Africa that would fund a concept like this. 
Kanye West: (39:57)
When you put an idea out. I remember I was supposed to do a couple songs at the MTV Awards, right? And then I said, “Bro.” And then what else did I say? I said, “Listen to the , bro. Listen to the kids, bro.” And are we running in 2020?
Audience: (40:29)
Yep. Yeah.
Kanye West: (40:31)
Okay, so tell me this. If you had had the opportunity to be given a million dollars just for being pregnant, would you have considered? And then everybody would start making children? The greatest gift of life? Maybe there would be a million children on this f***ing beautiful place?  But wait a minute, calm down, calm down. So she’s saying I don’t have the funding… Wait a second. Be quiet for a second, please. I do not have the funding for it, but I have the platform to present the idea for those who do. 
Kanye West: (41:12)
Let me elaborate on that. But the thing is, the first thing I said was, “I’m about a  thousand dollar stipend,” but that’s not going to work because I just listened to what Georgia said. Georgia said, “Okay, this person is mentally ill. This person is .” Then I went into the designing community and said that it takes a village to raise a child. It’s not simply a money situation; it is a people situation. It is a heart situation. It is a spirituality situation. It is a God situation. It is a family situation. Money can’t fix things. Money’s not even real. Is bit coin real? Does the gold back the money? At what point can someone just pressed delete and turn the lights out, all the electricity? Did you guys seen New York go dark? Did you guys see World Trade Center go down? Did you guys see all jobs stop for six months? So no one can tell me what God can’t do and what God will do.

One second, one moment. He was waiting. We got five minutes.  wait a second. You need to hear this.  this woman was sent by God and is so brave to be able to tell you her story. The fact that she was willing to stand up in front of all of you guys and tell you she had an abortion, to make the point of how important it was for her to have the option as a woman because she did not have the resources in order to have a baby as she felt. This woman is so brave. Georgia, can we make a hand for Georgia right now?
Kanye West: (43:19)
We got, we’re going to have to, you’re very . Come up here, you’re third.  I’ve got five minutes. I apologize, guys, but we have all the time in the world. We have all the questions.  Wait a second. I must  that I did smoke a little bit last night.  Every women or man who are charged with marijuana will be free.  Light up right now.  Wait a second. We have five more minutes. You’ve been waiting on this stage for about 17 minutes. What’s your name, sir? Gary, you’re waiting. Gary, Indiana, we about to bring that  Michael Jackson’s home. Oh, I’m sorry. 
Audience: (43:19)
I love Michael!
Kanye West: (43:19)
Oh, do we still love Michael?
Audience: (45:11)
Yeah! 
Kanye West: (45:11)
Do y’all love Cosby? Y’all love Bill Cosby?
Audience: (45:17)
Yeah! 
Kanye West: (45:17)
Be quiet. He’s talking about opioids.
Gary: (45:17)
I want to talk about opioids and .
Audience: (45:17)
Speak up!
Gary: (45:17)
It’s like the treatment. We’re addicted to the treatment.
Kanye West: (45:55)
And by the way, we’re getting addicted to the treatment of the endorphins. Hey, how many times y’all looked up what y’all likes are when you post something? That’s a form of treatment. Y’all getting treated. In Chicago, we call that “getting treated”. When y’all get to comment number eight, who is that person? You don’t even know who that person is.
Audience: (46:13)
Nobody!
Kanye West: (46:14)
That’s the person that’s influencing you, because when you hear bad things about yourself, about a photo, it make you want to up the photo. You want to Photoshop it. You want to 
Gary: (46:14)
I’m saying we’re addicted to the treatment. They’re trying to .
Kanye West: (46:14)
What I said, this is the solution to make it more, to have  more money. Big pharms. We just need to make big pharms. There’s a solution for big pharm. There’s a solution with that. I tell you this, I’m not going up against big pharm; I would die. They would kill me. But I tell you this, sitting next to them, I would make them more money. I would make them more prosperous, but we got to do it in a way where we balance holistic and modernity.  Okay, Aisha’s comment is on gun violence in the United States. I live on a 4,000 ranch and I can shoot AR15s all day, day, day, night without going to jail and it feels weird because I grew up in Chicago.
Kanye West: (48:00)
Because I grew up in Chicago where if you use one of the guns, that was strategically placed in your community for you to get locked, you will end up going to jail. I was talking to a fellow billionaire, and he talked about…no I don’t want to use his name. Hey bro, I told you I ain’t finna use his name. You told me to use his name. You think I work for you?
Kanye West: (48:07)
No that’s what I’m talking about. I told…don’t step up but what’s your name? Tell the people what your name is. .
Kanye West: (48:07)
Hey, guess what? Jesus saved the name. I’ll tell you what.
Kanye West: (48:07)
Real talk. Real talk. Young violence. I tell all my friends I know a place where you can shoot guns for free. Shooting guns are fun. .People are getting guns at age six. If you guys put down all your weapons, what happens if other countries and all media and all China…I actually couldn’t say. When other countries come in and you have no weapons, what do you think is going to happen? We are slaves. These random women know how to fire a firearm. They are trained to do this. Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.
Kanye West: (49:50)
When I talked to the billionaire…it was another white man I got to be specific. When we moved to the inner cities it was because of the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is over with now. It’s time to move again. If you have agriculture as your business, you get taxes breaks. Tesla, the original Tesla said that earth is a giant generator. God has given us freedom. You can feed your family and survive off of earth, wind, fire and  through proper engineering. But the education and the schools and these textbooks that have been given to you, have you ever got a textbook that said “Okay you can buy a hundred acres for a hundred thousand dollars in middle America and you can farm and feed your family?” Has there ever been a class on that? But guess what? There’s a reason…would you agree that there’s a reason why there’s never been a class on that?
Kanye West: (51:14)
Because ever time I talk, you’re directly behind me saying something. What I’m saying is, what I ask for specifically is that when you talk, you talk all the way through. When Kerry talks, he talks all the way through. What I’ve told you, the whole time I’m talking to a hundred people, two hundred…it started with a hundred people it’s down to  people. And every time that you make a comment .
Kanye West: (52:53)
And you are adding to the attention of them not understanding . That’s what I’m asking you. His name is Shiloh, you want to speak up? Are you done with COVID, okay?
Shiloh: (53:36)
I have two questions. Two quick questions. First question, I want you to elaborate on the  free of slaves and how . Second question, you believe so strongly in the bible, how do you think about .
Kanye West: (54:36)
I will start the meeting once everyone is completely quiet. Two questions. You got two questions bro, put your hands down. Put your hands down. I’m going to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 10 minutes ago. These are good questions. Put your hands down. Put your hands down. I hear you questions. I heard you sir. You don’t think I know how to listen? . No they know everyone’s irrelevant around me. I heard you the first time. No, no. She got some problems. I heard you the first time. No you don’t gap me. On God.
Kanye West: (59:38)
I appreciate that. I got two major, awesome, incredible…you… disrespecting .
Kanye West: (59:38)
You know what…you know what’s so funny? . We always so concerned about how skinny we are. That’s how I got plastic surgery. We always concerned about how good we speak English when it’s not our original language. We always concerned about how good we look and not embarrassing each other in front of an all white country that we work for. And don’t own anything in it. You stay looking bad…I believe we’re all beautiful. It’s not about how we look. It’s about our hearts. It’s about what’s in our souls.
Kanye West: (59:38)
Now, pause for a minute. If I was Trump I would have called you sister soldiers or something. But that’s not my vibe. Pause for a minute. You are the planned person that was sitting here like at TMZ to f*** my rally up. Be quiet.
Kanye West: (59:38)
I’m trying to answer a question and you are doing what the guy did to me at TMZ. You want to be that same person? And your face is covered so we don’t even know who you are.
Kanye West: (59:38)
400 years is related to the bible.  African American slavery. Slaves to Hebrews and the Egyptians. But we use that term loosely. Like we say “Jesus” anytime we want. But we got educated, we’re going to have to understand that we need to educate ourselves about what that means.
Kanye West: (59:38)
You probably with the press out there. You probably one of them. Hey, somebody go grab him, and take him out.
Kanye West: (59:39)
Give me a second to answer these two questions. I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago. Now the thing is, I am not going to pacify you with things that I do not believe in. But I will not put laws on things that you do believe in, but you don’t have no other opportunity to do anything else. I am not that kind of Christian. Jesus loved everyone. Jesus loved gay people. Jesus loved everyone. There’s a lot of Christians that feel like oh Jesus is against gay people. How could Jesus be  black church. That’s some true sh**.
Kanye West: (01:00:19)
Everybody’s family…everybody has everybody. Everybody’s got some holier than thou worth. . Everybody got that one uncle that go to the money, the viral. Everybody got the one uncle that was touching the kids. Everybody got the one uncle…everybody. Everybody’s family…we all are imperfect human beings . Jesus loves everyone. He does not discriminate against anyone. Now the Harriet Tubman thing is, I’m sick of this black iconography being used by white organization for us to look up to and say “This is us.” I do not…I own 100% of the Yeezy trademark, but up until now Adidas was getting 85%. And now after this, they either out of business with me or they going to get 10%. I decided not to not make it 15. I decided to make it 10.
Kanye West: (01:01:12)
That was extremely good. That was extremely bad. I’m going to win in 2020. Out.",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-presidential-campaign-rally-speech-south-carolina-july-2020-annotated

Us living as we do upside down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's hole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. America stripped
For bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. The signs of Truth
Were tattooed across our often-entered vagina
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
We learned to our amazement untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter
Of the mother country whose legs
Were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom: free doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were
Revolutionary code names that preceded
The bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
Bubbling in the mother country's crotch
And behold a baby girl was born
Nurtured by slave holders and whitey racists
It grew and grew and grew screwing
Indiscriminately like mother, like daughter
Everything unplagued by her madame mother
The present mocks us, good Black people
With keen memories set fire to the bastards
Who ask us in a whisper to melt and integrate
Young, very young, teeny
Bopping revolt on weekend young dig
By proxy what a mental ass kicking
They receive through institutionalized everything
And vomit up slogans to stay out of Vietnam
They seek to hide their relationship with the world's prostitute
Alienating themselves from everything
Except dirt and money with long hair, grime, and dope
To camo-hide the things that cannot be hidden
They become runaway children to walk the streets downtown with everyday
Black people sitting on the curb
Crying because we know that they will go back
Home with a clear conscience and a college degree
The irony of it all, of course
Is when a pale face SDS motherfucker dares
Look hurt when I tell him to go find his own revolution
He wonders why I tell him that America's revolution
Will not be the melting pot but the toilet bowl
He is fighting for legalized smoke, or lower voting age
Less lip from his generation gap and fucking in the street
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
Where is my parallel to that?
All I want is a good home and a wife and a children
And some food to feed them every night
Back goes pale face to basics
Does Little Orphan Annie have a natural?
Do Sluggo's kinks make him a refugee from Mandingo?
What does Webster's say about soul?
I say you silly trite motherfucker, your great grandfather
Tied a ball and chain to my balls
And bounced me through a cotton field
While I lived in an unflushable toilet bowl
And now you want me to help you overthrow what?
The only Truth that can be delivered to a four year
Revolutionary with a hole card i.e. skin is this:
Fuck up what you can in the name of
Piggy Wallace, Dickless Nixon, and Spiro Agnew
Leave brother Cleaver and Brother Malcolm alone please
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?

Monster with clothes, monster with the hoes
Buy 'em new heels just to keep 'em on they toes
Keep it Drew Hill, fly steps from the door
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low

Hope you're doin' your thing, too

I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem

Couldn't tell you how old your son is

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it; Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
(This copy is for Hype Williams)
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever; who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

Ain't no question if I want it, I need it

Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more

Can’t Tell Me Nothing (Sunday Service Choir),UnKnown,2019.0,", til we get the message
I feel the pressure
Under more scrutiny
And what I do?
Act more stupidly
Pop more jewelry, hoard Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's
I ain't go to hell man
I guess the money should've changed em
I finally came back to where I came from

Ahhh la la la la
Our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ
Accept and receive eternal life
Aaahhh
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing
Ahhh la la la la
Our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ
Accept and receive eternal life
Aaahhh
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing
They can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, they can't tell me nothing

See the devil will make you think
If you follow God
You finna fall off
We put these tickets on sale in the morning
And they sold out in the morning
Nah I'm saying I be in the studio
And people come up to me like
""Man, you better not , you better not do this""
And then they'll play songs that's all like
""I was with these girls like this, I did this girl""
All this type of stuff-
Basically sayin' like
Look, if you follow God
You finna fall off
That Jesus came number one1, 3 weeks
That Jesus born
But not just that, finding that peace
Inside you
Not just the numbers
God using us to show off
To show God is better than the Devil
The Devil took all the producers, the musicians, the designers
Moved us all out to Hollywood
Moved us all out to New York
Chasing ghost statues
Literally signing a contract to selling our souls
They got contracts out there that say you can't say Jesus
When we was working on this album people used to be coming over the studio just to say Jesus as loud as they wanted to
You can say Jesus in Ye studio
You see, I'm like one of them, I'm like a uh uh, a Nineteen Star Michelin chef
The way I cook up, you know what I'm saying
But if the Devil have you serving 8 restaurants at one time
It might drive you crazy
And one of the restaurants could be your own ego
One of them restaurants could be public opinion
One of them restaurants could be legacy
One of them restaurants could be fame
One of them restaurants could be money
But there's only one restaurant we servin' for tonight
And I said tonight 'cause I be in the future sometimes
And that's God's restaurant
Where everybody coming as service to God
And he bringing it back tenfold
A hundredfold
A millionfold
Blessings untold
Blessings harder than gold
Stronger than it go
I returned my soul
To the one that chose me
The one that owns me
The ones that shows me
And that's what God showed me
The Devil controlled me
But he can't hold me
Because God control me
And life has showed me
That God is the only
The real not the phony
The phonies will clone me
Just watch how they cloned me
And 
I'm here with more homies
I'm here with my families
I don't need a Grammy
I'm back in the building
I'm here with my children
You know it's a feeling
You know it's a feeling
You know it's a feeling

Ahhh la la la la (Yeah, that's that feeling!)
Ahhh la la la la (Yeah, that's that feeling!)
Ahhh la la la la (Yeah, that's that feeling)
La la la la yea
For my Lord and savior, Jesus Christ
Ohhh
Ah ah, ayy

Kanye West monologue at the White House,UnKnown,2018.0,"Here we have Larry Hoover's lawyer with us today and it’s a prisoner that we're focused on. He has six life sentences and they have him next to the unibomber doing 23 and 1 … Really the reason why they imprisoned  is because he started doing positive for the community. He started showing that he actually had power, he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice but he could wrap people around, so there’s theories that there's infinite amounts of universe, and there's alternate universe, so it's very important for me to get Hoover out because in an alternate universe, I am him. And I have to go and get him free because he was doing positive inside of Chicago, just like how I'm moving back to Chicago and it's not just about, you know, getting on stage and being an entertainer, and having a monolithic voice that's forced to be a specific party.
“You know, people expect that if you're black you have to be Democrat. I have conversations that basically said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being Democrat they say – you know first of all, it’s a limit to amount of jobs, so the fathers lose the job and they say, ‘We’ll give you more money for having more kids in your home.' And then we got rid of the mental health institutes in the 80s and the 90s and the prison rates just shot up. And now you have Chiraq, what people call Chiraq, which actually, our murder rate is going down by 20 per cent every year. I just talked to the superintendent, met with Michael Sacks, that’s Ron's right hand man. So, I think it's the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. You know they tried to scare me to not wear this hat, my own friends, but this hat, it gives me power in a way.
“You know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. And also I’m married now into a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on, it's beautiful though. But there's times where, you know, it's something about, I love Hillary, I love everyone, right, but the campaign “I'm With Her” just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You made us Superman, that's my favorite superhero, and you made a Superman cape for me.
“Also as a guy that looks up to you, looks up to Ralph Lauren, looks up to American industry guys. Non-political, no bullshit  – put the beep on it, however you want to do it, five seconds delay – and just goes in and gets it done. Right now, you gave me the heart to go to Adidas. When I went in, in 2015, we were a $14 billion company losing $2 billion a year. Now, we have $38 billion market cap. It's called “The Yeezy Effect.” And went and I said, “You have to bring manufacturing on-shore. Not even on-shore, into the core. It's not about the borders. The core of Adidas, and Chicago, is the core of middle America, and we have to make middle America strong.
“So, I had the balls, because I have enough balls to put on this hat. I mean, this Adidas thing made me a billionaire. And I could have lost $200 million walking away from that deal. But even with that, I knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from that deal, than to have no fathers in Chicago, with no homes. And when we do have prison reformation, not rehabilitation, because they didn't have the abilities in the first place. We never had anyone who taught us, they didn't teach us. Then any specific deal, anything, that we bring jobs into America. And that we provide a transition with mental health and the AmeriCan education curriculum that Jim has worked on. Larry Hoover also has a curriculum that he's worked on. We have Montessori curriculums that we worked on. WeWorks has beautiful curriculum. The Waldorf establishment has a curriculum. We have meditation.
“There's a lot of things affecting our mental health that makes us do crazy things, that puts us back into that trap door that's called the 13th Amendment. I did say, “abolish,” with the hat on, because why would you keep something around that's a trap door. If you building a floor, the constitution is the base of our industry, of our country, of our company. Would you build a trap door that if you mess up and accidentally something happens, you fall and you end up next to the Uni-bomber, you gotta remove all that trapdoor out of the relationship. The four gentleman that wrote the 13th Amendment, and I think the way the universe works is perfect, we don't have 13 floors, do we? You know, the four gentleman that wrote the 13th amendment didn't look like the people they were amending. Also, at that point, it was illegal for blacks to read, or African Americans, to read. So, that meant if you actually read the Amendment, you'd get locked up! And turned into a slave. Again, so what I think is, we don't need sentences, we need pardons. We need to talk to people.
“I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in the NBA and NFL. He looked at my brain, it's equal on three parts. I'm gonna go ahead, drop some bombs for you. 98 percentile IQ test, I had a 75 percentile of all human beings when it was counting eight numbers backwards, so I'm gonna work on that one. The other ones, 98 percent, Tesla, Freud. So, he said that I actually wasn't bipolar, I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10-20 years from now, where I wouldn't even remember my son's name. So, all this power that I've got, and I'm taking my son to the Sox game and all that, I wouldn't be able to remember his name, from a misdiagnosis. What we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money. That's one thing, I've never stepped into a situation where I didn't make people more money. So, we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories, we can bring, not only Adidas on shore, we could bring Foxconn and set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota .
“Yeah, Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs, people making 53,000 a year. And one of the things we gotta set is, Ford to have the highest designs. The dopest cars. The most amazing. I don't really say, “dope,” I don't say negative words and try to flip ‘em. We just say positive, lovely, divine, universal words. So, the flyest, freshest, most amazing car. And what we start with, is – I brought a GIF with me right here.  This right here is the iPlane 1. It's a hydrogen powered airplane, and this is what our president should be flying in. We're gonna have Apple, an American company, work on this plane.
“What I need Saturday Night Live to improve on, or what I need the liberals to improve on is, if he don't look good , we don't look good. This is our President. He has to be the freshest, the flyest, the flyest planes, the best factories. And we have to make our core be empowered. We have to bring jobs into America, because our best export is entertainment and ideas. But when we make everything in China and not America, then we're cheating on our country, and we're putting people in positions to have to do illegal things to end up in the cheapest factory every, the prison system.”",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-kanye-west-monologue-at-the-white-house-annotated

Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years ain't picked a career
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you oh, it all falls down
I say fuck the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even goin' act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it

Jesus Walks- Creative Writing,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You know what the Midwest is?
Young and Restless
Where restless niggas might snatch ya necklace
And next these niggas might jack ya Lexus
Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor of the view alone will leave you breathless
Try to catch it, it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass, and arrest us
Saying ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast!""
Huh! Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't goin' nowhere, but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My Mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well Mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
(Jesus Walks with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now (I want Jesus)
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
(I want Jesus)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
I want to talk to God, but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long, so long
So long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers

To the victims of welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah

Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They said you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played
Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down

Rain down on the slain

Rain down on the farm
Shower us with your love
Wash us in the blood
Have some for the thugs
I done spend it in the mud
Grew up life tryna thug
And now all my friends thugs
And now all my phones buzz
Everybody love drugs
One off from the club
No choice to sell drugs
No choice locked up
No choice locked up
Rain down on us
Rain down on us

Shower down on us
Wash us in the blood
Wash us in the blood
Whole life being thugs
No choice selling drugs

They wanna sign a Calm-Ye
That's right I call him Calm-Ye
But don't take me the wrong way
Cause God took me a long way
Everything you seeing on me
They wanna edit the interviews
They wanna take it to interludes
Cut a whole sentence to interlude
You know that it's fake if it's in the news
So I let it fly when I'm in the booth
The devil a liar and I been the truth
Living cause nobody living
And nobody getting it, doing it different

Through the Wire- Creative Writing,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation, man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy Kanye to the
Chi-Town what's going on
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
I drink a boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizerk
Not to worry the Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzork
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her, her sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmit Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
No use me tryna be lyin'
I've been trying to be sign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making man
I 
really apologize how I sound right now man
If this ain't clear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said like six weeks
You know we had reconstru...
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror, half of my jaw was missing from half my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This is what I gotta say right here dawg
Yeah, turn me up yeah
Uh
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid s- that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
You know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um
I was goin' to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on

SAIC Commencement Lecture,UnKnown,2015.0,"I am a pop artist. So my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas
'I’m sorry' is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say 'You shouldn't have to be sorry for your opinions ...' George Bush ... has some very cool self portraits. I didn't know he was an artist!
I felt my nerves a bit, and I don’t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored, a humanization of a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sat there , kind of shaking a little bit, is I need to get rid of that feeling, I need to not be nervous
This honor is going to make your lives easier, for two reasons: You don’t have to defend me as much! And I’m going to make all of our lives easier. It is these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I have been saying my entire life – whether it was the sign of Paul McCartney grabbing me and saying, 'It's OK, he doesn't bite,' or the New York Times cover, or the Time (magazine) most-influential cover. And now a doctorate at the School of the Art institute of Chicago
When I was giving a lecture at Oxford, I brought up this school, because when I went on a mission to create in other spaces – apparel, film, performance – it would have been easier to have just said I had a degree at the Art Institute of Chicago! Thank you
Questions from the crowd:
Can I give you a hug? When are you going to open a school? What does Chicago mean to you? Can we hang out later? Do you wanna build a snowman?
I say I wanna build a snowman because I want Bob Iger, the head of Disney, to invest in my ideas. Not one idea, not a good idea, or even a bad idea — a series of them. But just in my ideas...I feel Disney should have an art fund that completely supports all of the artists and...I feel there should be a responsibility",https://genius.com/Kanye-west-saic-commencement-lecture-annotated

Man im blanking out from this flask
I see a car
Lights flash so quick

Blood dripping from my cuts
I just wanted a little buzz

Statement on Beck Winning AOTY,UnKnown,UnKnown,"All I know is if the Grammys want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We ain't gonna play with them no more. 'Flawless,' Beyoncé video. Beck needs to respect artistry and he should have given his award to Beyoncé, and at this point, we tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration and we as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. ""Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody's speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, my daughter and my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity.
