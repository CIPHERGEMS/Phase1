Bring It On,Stress (The Extinction Agenda),1994.0,"Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!

Moncha, I even be gettin' more graphic
Than a Neo-Geo thirty-two bit computer chip
Be slipped between my lips and then I'll spit
Spit it out, spit it out, go ahead, spit it out
That itty-bitty style you upchuck
Better believe I butt-fuck MCs from the rear
It appears you're stuck up
It's my terminology that strikes the mind
And rips this beat apart
You know the many styles I choose
Will bruise crews from the start
I flow awkwardly, that's awkwardly I flow, that's to the rhythm
Incisions are made into the brain
And then I begin to give 'em a lobotomy, follow me
I'm shapin' your brain like pottery all over the track
Gimme the P-H, gimme the A-R
Gimme the O-A, gimme the H-E, Pharoahe
Crazy poison tip arrows are hittin' you from all directions
You cannot dodge or manage to dislodge them
From the point at which they are connecting
I am s-s-selecting a n-n-n-new style-style
For the p-pile-piles of MC's who try to get buck-buckwild
F-F-F-Fuck that! When I'm in a renovative state of mind
I'm innovative, never been afraid of rockin' the microphone
I'm prone to be eliminating
Cling when I sing a song of sixpence
If it makes sense then sing along
Cling along to my nuts if you got guts then bring it on

Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!
Bring it on motherfucker, bring it on!

There is no equivalent one consider me the epitome of rhymes
Rhythm to techs execution is parallel to them with an exception of the organisms
My telepathy cannot be dismantled
 
so stop sweatin' me
Advanced data, now watch your greater updates and raps get trampled
Fee-fi-fo steps up
 
elevations show
That I'm ahead of your time, specifically right behind a dope rhyme
Rippin' shit up at prime time, I'm
 
Optimus Prime/time material
Imperial wizard of vocabularic havoc
 
I eat MC's like cereal!
That's soggy,
 
milky skills like Mister Miyagi
When it's foggy I release globby spits of remains of rappers in the lobby as a hobby
I'LL, rip your nit-SHIT GET STICK QUICK, GET YOUR CREW - before I do
Something gory to your quite futile STYLES
Miniature raps get waxed, simonized
Into the fifth dimension of your centrifugal never typical stand attention
I'm, mystical rip shit til the power blows (BLOWS!)
Those chose to compete we delete em, observe defeat!
That's sendin' down from above to GET CHA, HIT CHA, split cha ditch cha
Picture you, victorious
I'm gory plus your shit's mad boring
Bring it on

Crush, kill, destroy, stress
Crush, kill, destroy, stress
Crush, kill, destroy, stress

Pain, stress
My brain, can't even rest
It's hard to maintain the pressure on my chest
Excess frustration strikes!
Blood rushes my head when I come across roads
With dead mics and wack promoted shows it's hard
But with the presence of God
I'm true to the game
So I'm back, black, to take charge, and recapture
The time, wish it could never be wack -- I'm pure
I insert my lifeline into the track, the energy
In me is a poison with no unrevealed remedy
I'm spreading like leprosy throughout the record label
'Cause mines put me and Monch's career in jeopardy
Can you come see me in the ghetto where it's dark?
Bullets are real lost peeps lurks in the heart
Lord knows it hurts, we kick the Hertz to the curb
Execute first things first, and put blunted minds to work
My herd's tight and my fans supports
So I'm a-ight for the time being seeing peace
But taking no shorts (no shorts)

Crush, kill, destroy, stress
Crush, kill, destroy, stress
Crush, kill, destroy, stress
Crush, kill, destroy, stress
(album version includes a short ""taxi cab"" skit here)

You will now consider me the apocalyptic one
After this rhyme, henceforth, there is none
No more will exist when I emerge
From the mist in whence I was born into, scorned
Most of you can't even comprehend what I am saying to you
Even in my human form the message I'm relaying
Why do you choose to mimic these wack MCs?
Why do you choose to listen to R&B?
Why must you believe that somethin' is phat
Just because it's played on the radio 20 times per day?
My perception of poetical injection is ejaculation
The immaculate conception
The hall walker, who stalks bodies in Central Park
Soon emergency services'll outline that body in chalk
Then I begin to walk away and spit
Then when I walk away I talk shit!
Huh, a driver sprayed my face with mace
She didn't know that I enjoyed the taste of radioactive waste
When I'm in the backseat of your mid-town taxi
Don't even ask me for the cash G
The four cabs before didn't pick me up
Now ask yourself who the fuck's gonna stick me up

Stray Bullet,Stress (The Extinction Agenda),1994.0,"Let the trigger finger put the pressure to the mechanism
Which gives a response for the automatic *bang*
Clip to release projectiles in single
File forcing me to ignite then travel
Through the barrel, headed for the light
At the end of a tunnel with no specific target in sight
Slow the flow like H₂O water
Visualize the scene of a homicide, a slaughter
No remorse for the course I take when you pull it
The result's a stray bullet
Niggas who knew hit the ground runnin' and stay down
Except for the kids who play on the playground
'Cause for some little girl she'll never see more than six years of life
Trifleing,
 when she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards
A red Range Rover, then I ricochet
Fast past a brother's ass, oh damn, what that nigga say
""Aww fuck it"", next target's Margaret's face *bang*
And I struck it, now it's a flood of blood in circumfrence to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street
Shame how we had to meet *bang*
Dashin', buckin', greet by fuckin' family
They follow behind me in a orderly fashion
Bashin' through flesh, I'm wild
Crashin' through the doors of projects hallways to deflect off of the tiles
I'm coming for you little girl
Once inside I shatter your world
Swirl, no more dreams, no hopes when I spray
You better pray to the Pope or the Vatican before I go rat-tat-a-tat again
I'm mad again brother somebody's mother will be sad again
But whose blue skies will turn grey
From the attack of the MAC-11, I'm a stray bullet


Great balls of fire, I'm travelling at higher speeds
To proceed to penetrate flesh, hitting the splint
After splitting the chest of a Queens fiend
Age of pagers shredded to pieces from the Glock 9
And it's hollow tips it releases
The police is in back of the ambulance
Blood loss as I shift across your chest
Arrest, rupture, I mess up ya, slasher
I bust ya liver, faster, blood pours *bang*
Now it's up to the master, boom, as I crash open the doors
Thank me for spraying the operating room
The body still consumes me, doc had to remove me
Mmm lord, why do they use me? *bang*
I'm takin' individual for keeps, Hobbes
So peep the cops in the ghetto bustin' shots for props
And when I hit, shit *bang bang bang bang*
Soon you forgets-me-not
Cops tried to explain to his pops what I've done
I flip up the hollow tipper and I'm not the one
And as a human I'm the surprising one
Prince Po I flow the ripper
Either way you never, ever know how I'm coming
Metamorphasizing, rising in turbulence
Condensed into a bullet, pull it, now I'm making moves
With no sympathizing, uhh, so take a hit nigga, sprint *bang*
Onto the scenario, I'm at a party with O
A lot of honies parlay and the DJ's playin' the Fudge Pudge flow
Five niggas come up in the club for a rub
[Yo O peep it, oh shit O duck (oh shit!, oh shit!)
*pop pop pop pop pop* *woman screams*]
Another hit, another struck
Here comes Mr. Stray Bullet
Five, the tip, getting my jollies from the screams of the ripped
In your chest, then I flip
Nip your liver, blood flowin' like a river
Money starts to shiver then I give a delivery of burns
Bruises, fake shoes is your renaissance
No response your moms is out cold
Figure I'm bigger takin' your heart nigga at twenty years old

Releasing Hypnotical Gases,Organized Konfusion,1991.0,"As you look from henceforth I come
Riding the wind thus eliminating competition from bird's-eye view
I'm descending in helicopters in a village raid
Flesh will burn when exposed to the poetical germ grenade
I'm highly intoxicating your mind
When I'm operating on cell walls to membranes
Cytoplasms and protoplasms
Disintegrate 'em, eliminate 'em, now no one has 'em
 
in battle
I display a nuclear ray that'll destroy bone marrow in cattle
Thereby destroying the entire food supply
That's crawling with AIDS, maggots, flies
It's ironic when a demonic government utilizes bionics and a six million dollar man to capture me
Clever, however you could never ever begin to apprehend a hologram
Who's determined to fight solely
To defend in wars a land of the holy
I threw a rock and I ran
'Cause I couldn't stand anymore within the depths of the sand
So don't ask me who's sane
'Cause the hypnotical gases are eating my brain

Oxygen levels... check it
Hydrogen levels... check it
Nitrogen levels... check it

Twenty-thousand leagues down below
Minus one-hundred and forty three degrees
Seize the info, gather the archaelogists
The aftermath needs to follow this 
'cause it's deep
Equivalent to the esophagus
Spreads to scientists, a.k.a. 
Optimus Prime
Time, television is dead
On this issue and very much irrelevant to this intuition
Deleting any alias info and descriptive mortal calm
Partition with infrared light vision
Precision, beams, colors, reds, fuschias, lime-greens
Black, don't you know my formulas form dope lyrics
Uplift spirits and yo I hear it's fatal
To walk the path of Konfusion
Where it's torture some cherish
While most human-like beings perish
Subjected to death
Their bodies don't agree with the hypnotical intellect
Poetical acid is burning up flesh
At the end of corridor you see me sitting there, Johnny More Grotesque 
literature
Somewhat equivalent to concentrated sodium hypochlorite
Insight, foresight, more sight
The clock on the wall reads a quarter past midnight
You feel nauseous
Forever you will avoid my royal presence as I step into darkness

Now is the time...to stretch your brain to its maximum

I am one who is one with all things
Thus the unorthodox I am
The paradox I am
The equinox extending my hand into dimensions
To unlock new doorways
And so the light has revealed to me that there must be more ways
And so I play with rhythms
It's nothing more than a mere game
Enabling me to advance in wisdom
Words will exist like vampires
No need for sunlight
From concentration camps I escape with my sanity
In 2010 every man will be subject to global warming
Formless oval, millions of locusts swarming
Seek and you shall find the deliverer of a rhyme
The intelligent one utilizing the mind
Third vision,
 surrounded by a three-sided figure
Containing the brain, 
the triggering mechanism from which I strike
Sight beyond sight, sound beyond sound
Which comes from below the magma, the granite, the ground
The surface will seperate dispersing harmful ashes
Your optics will not be able to detect the deadly hypnotical gases
Damn it's hard to breathe
But if I got one breath left
I'll suck wind from the valley of death
Here I come from the slums of Earth to center
I reveal myself as a beast within a
Unbreakable shell, walking through the doorways of Heaven
Or is this Hell?

The time is now... right now
This is the hour! This is the new dawn!
This is the new day

As I step into the thunderdome with flows as the wind blows
Visualize the intros
Releasing hypnotical gases, chemicals mixed, fixed
Taking it to the sixth round of poetical warfare
Energetically I walk with the flare
Rampaging like a rock-like figure
Throughout the night's atmosphere, I swear
My wrist holds mind-trigger, darkness can't overshadow me
'Cause of high rate of smashing you then trashing you
After I'm bashing you with my hammer
Whenceforth passed to me by Odin
Occasionally my profile is low-key
Gamma rays
 brainwashed to transforms me
But I still withhold my hammer to lift me up
For God still is my uplifter
I use this knowledge just to crush the cluster of Grifter
Night approaches so I proceed in flight
Back to the Hall of Justice as I continue to disintegrate 'em
Translating the codes in hypnotical language
Then a Theta assault stepping up
Frontin' to be quite blunt a radical creator of a 
poetical, hypothetical, mathematical slang slur
 punch that stuns and amazes and dazes and phases the stages
With pages of the lost chapters
Unfound factors
So I stretch like Reed Richards across the land
Continue with reading your equilibrium
With concepts that confuse ya, metabolism's fallin' off
Data consider oblivion
Now as I walk through the valley of death
Ignoring the battle lashes and gashes and rashes
The atom smashes 'cause I released the last hypnotical gases",https://genius.com/Organized-konfusion-releasing-hypnotical-gases-lyrics

Hand to hand rap combat black
Back in the land I expand data for the wack
Leaving mutilated bodies lacerated limbs grim sites
And new jacks, pick up six and grab the ore
Dig deep into the ghetto (absorb)
I take you to a new realm
Levitating above the norm
 
anticipating me to pick up
Seven more new jacks and commencing with this and fading

In the vicinity the city's committee consider me
The trilogy of terror

whatever I do I bring light
You're blinded by the glare of the trendsetter
Beware when I strike, blueprints like no other
The soldier of fortune, the undercover
Rebel of rap attackin the ones who's attackin blacks

Elevate with the almighty God in front of me
Teach seeds in the hood the truth

The original book which contains the words of God
Six hours until dawn, my quest to capture the
 
queen
Without being seen by the pawns
Call me Bishop, bishop takes rook, rook takes pawn
Pawn takes knight, knight takes queen
Queen takes the original King James version (check)

False clergymen you're urgin me to call you a virgin
When to say the least
Who can you trust when a priest is now the beast?

Hit rip rhyme rap ritual hit you with my best shot
Get you sit you down, let you know I never get dropped

Even inside of the grooves of a record

Coming-uh, coming-uh

Face the bass drum, you run when you hear it

Piles up like drug cases in Queens
County Criminal Court, shorty, step back
Nigga you oughta watch it, my whole herd's packin'
Fuck rappin', let's take it to the corner of the block

Rock- rock on with your bad self

I- I used to play beats on the lunchroom table
This it really enables me to stay stable inside of my mind
Thus allowing me to climb and then shine
This is a process that will occur in due time
Bust, everything I thrust is activated
Styles I file are not decaffeinated, I'm rough
Tougher than Tonka, why I even electrify the sky
As if I was Blanka
Kids follow me and my Phillies like Willy Wonka
Silly,
 
I assault and conquer, the cult and brainwash
And squash your little minds with rhymes
Rhymes that are rituals

Not to sell units, you know
They say motherfucker, bitch-ass and Glock

Hey you, you can't deny when I bust caps, the whole block scatters
Scraps of matter shatter, mad glass and what not

Prisoners of War,Organized Konfusion,1991.0,"I stand here before the forces of evil with a style
The poetically God-gifted child
Bringin' forth the story of a lyrical soldier
Blessed to manifest in the eyes of the beholder
Words of wisdom 
never abuse the lines
They increase, as I release a phrase like a Uzi 9
From the laryn-ex
Shot in repitition, words never heard before
But still the rendition of rap will enable me to attack
From dawn to dusk, for liberation
Driven I will never give in to interrogation
The rank, given to me, the Pharoahe
'Cause every blow flows like a crossbow
Equipped to pierce your soul with a poison-tip arrow
Any man wearing a blindfold can be misled
But wise are the ones with the eyes in the backs of the head
Here's the key to unlock the door:
Imagine a poet without poetical flaw
Rhymes are for sure as an attack
'Cause they adapt to combat for the prisoners of war

I drop, smash and cause a damage equivalent to a hydrogen bomb
Raidin' villages like a poetical soldier in Vietnam
Poetry releasin' deadly gasses
Bodies deteriorating as they stalk past the fatal acids
As a rebel of rap, I stop
Load the Luger as I manuever with precaution
As I verbally counterattack
Striking like a mad sniper 'cause I'm the type of hyperactive viper
To wipe away the enemy with no remedy
'Cause I'm the epitome so don't try to get rid of me
You little itty-bitty twenty-five automatic, you're killin' me
'Cause I'm a Glock 9 that will rock your mind, distortin' it
Shorten your brainwaves
As the rhyme intertwine with the sign of the times
Don't sleep 'cause I creep attackin' from the side that is blind
Therefore I gotta be hard to the core
And I walk as a prisoner of war

Wake up to the mathematics of an 
erratic rap
Rejuvenator of rhyme, that sort of come automatic
Poetical medical medicine for the cerebellum
I divert 'em and flirt 'em, insert 'em then I repel 'em
A breakdown, poetical shakedown
Fifty-two pick-up a stick-up so get on the floor facedown
The ammo to keep the people steppin'
Breakin' open the vault because I'm like a verbal assault weapon
I'm mathematical, acrobatical
Attack the wack, take rap to the maximum
You're strung out, you're hung out when you heard the style that I brung out of thin air
Must come out my mouth where I stick my tongue out in the atmosphere
Take a good look at what's happening here
On the microphone, I'm rappin'
Pickin' 'em, stickin' 'em up
Breakin' 'em, shakin' 'em up and bashin'
The lyric dictator, the aviator of antonym
All beware to prepare for the guillotine
Rhymes go express, expert, extreme
Be up to par with wisdom and intellect
Detatching one's head directly from one's neck
Still I've been illing and drilling your brain
Like a villain I came in the darkness to spark the literature for sure
When I rhyme for the prisoners of war

There is strength in my men-tal-bolism
Brains to spare upon info, knowledge, data
Greater aspects affects my future environment
So in the event I drop science to suit ya, uproot ya
Hunt ya down
Verbally attackin' from the ground up to intellectually shoot ya
Lurkin' through the shadows of darkness, shots fired
The spark hits the trees, releasin' lyrical ammo
While I camoflouge in the flash of my stature
Mentally cease MCs that be surrounded I capture
Enemy lines are crushed, bum-rushed
And plus your government officials are corrupted
'Cause they're down with us
Poetical rebels on a rampage of wrecked dialects
Blown lyric projects
Heat is scopin' you through my infrared twenty-twenty scope lens
Steppin' upon base that's when the Organized Konfusion massacre begins with a blast
Never will an intruder approach 'cause they will never ever last

For now, you don't love me no more?
Hey, by the way who's Kirk?
Left a message on my machine said you didn't come to work
You're AWOL from the job,

The way you're acting, I think you've been slobbing 'em
Sometimes I swear I think I feel like robbing 'em
But my papa told me never to snuff no girls
You give 'em diamonds, jewels, furs, pearls
Rings and shoes and cars and things

You couldn't blame me if I treat her like Amy Fisher
And dismiss her from the courtroom in a Yugo
You know, something like Joe Buttafuoco

For her ring finger,
 yes I used to bang her
Like ""inga binga bunga"" but I'm out like 
Felix Unger

I reminisce back when I was swinging with Miss Pretty Young Thing
She got a kick outta my jeep and a meal at Burger King
I shot her ego down with my maturity
Getting papers from Port Authority doing security,
 uh
She just used to climb up in my whipper whip
Just to stress a nigga quick, young chick on a ego trip
Whip ping ha ha I had to stop the pigeon
Step, find a dove who comprehends exactly how I'm living
So I met a girl around the way from the Uptown set
We used to drown in sweat, uh
She was my darling til I lost my 9 to 5
She started dissing listen pretending then shitting on my pride
She tried to crush my pride so cut off so to the next
Uh, not for the sex, this one used to run through the projects
Gossiping with the next about the next
Loved to cover her neck, for stress gave her a cat as a pet
Itchbay 
didn't know which way she wanted to flow
Flowing with this nosey hoochie when I was out doing my shows
Doing a dem bow, dem bow, dem bow, dem bow
You can't front, you used to bust all over Prince Po

Funky slices of beats like this

Up against the wall, I caught you with the drugs

Get it together, girls don't despair 'cause I'll be your

I tell you now you'll never hate it (hate it)
The triple X when it comes to sex is what I'm rated
I tell you now that I can give good love
Yes I'm the one you should love (tell us about it)
So don't try to diss Fudge Pudge
'Cause it's alright, with, me
Kick slick rhymes out of the mouth
Tricky in a joust, plus I'm down with Mickey Mouse
C'mon everyone, lets flow to the rhythm of my tongue
To the rhythm of the drum
Emcees wanna battle but they can't get with the
Capital M-O-N-C-H on the mic I get swifter
Than the rest of them maybe even the best
Scoring 101 in a poetical test
So O.C., if you know who you are
Get on the mic become a superstar

The form I signify is cultivated why spread it
Many many lyrics memorized embedded
In my think tank sharp as a shank knife
I strike the mic just as quick as a snake bite
Suck out the poison, yeah go 'head, try it
Skills of an assassin, watch as I'll fly
Thorough, doesn't matter the borough I'm swingin'
Clear to the end keep the party people clingin'
Treatin' emcees like government cheese
Shred 'em like cheddar cut 'em up 'cause P's
Laid out on the bed while we write to the tracks
He's so funny when it comes to the snaps
Write a hardcore rhyme, that's what the boy said
I could whip up a rhyme that could slice a boar's head
No that's ham, and we don't digest that
Organism that's made of dog and a rat
So fee-fi-fum, everybody's Funky Drummin' it
When you hear the bassline, you'll be hummin' it
I'm keepin' it simple cause I can swing many ways
Rappers get met, 'cause MET it pays
It's a mad mad world and it's best to never wild out
Go against me and I'm quick to pull out
The driveway, by the way hey
Picked up your girl 'cause she was goin' my way
Hand on the stick, foot on the clutch
Flowin' over eighty miles per hour, I'll pull it on outta
Skid marks left on the ground like tattoos
The rubber smell badder than the doodoo on your shoes
You stink, better think wise is what I advise
'Cause O.C. has skills to kill a whole tribe
Off, awkward, spaghetti I'll sauce it

Walkin around, with the fo'-pound, now lately
Lookin over my shoulder with a Sig-Sauer .380
Maybe the baby Tec woulda been nicer to bring along
Sing along with me if y'all know the song
Mines, gimme, not Vinnie but I'm Naughty
In forty projects drinkin 40's till I'm forty

Truncatin drum loops with Pauly

I hit a homer, and I got jumped by The Simpsons
Not to mention, Pharoahe Mon-Chi-Chi,

Of the time I'm sure of my rhyme like Shank Redemption
The remaining eleven percent come from seven percent
Great God Pharoahe of heaven ascent
Racin a 5.0, in my 380i

Truly with the three three three three

No more sweet sixteens and dick teasing
Too many Tech-9's behind trees and five-oh keeps a black brotha bleedin
Fillin em up like Unleaded Phillips 66
Owin me more than 40 Acres and these Mule kicks
Gettin the 
48 Hours, like Eddie Murphy
Too dark to mix, now triple-six wanna hurt me
Still reachin for more than, ten million sales
In Studio 54, Waiting to Exhale
When in the world 12 disciples, in this life cycle
That's trifle, so my impact's a twenty gauge rifle
Fifty/fifty eight and thirteen inches of weapon

Three strikes, two tokes, once again for the mass

C'mon bounce, c'mon (c'mon we gotta) bounce

Do you wanna hear, the boogie bear
Jump up and do the freak funk, throw your hands in the air
Compare me, with none
The son, of the king, triple crown, just to get the job done
I surpass fast dash through a mass of traps fliers
And blow up the spot, and Organize on that ass, I'm hot
Black, with no sugar straight coffee
You stalk me, because your girl wanna hawk me
Jock me clock me watch me mutilate the mic
Rip it apart, shatter your brain when I strike
Add a syringe of raps to cleanse you fall apart
Style damage you amateur cause I'm blowin your file
Honey-dips see me and they yellin Organized
And they know -- Pharoahe Monche's got skills for the wise

Oh, huh, shit! Look who walked in the door
Ryu-kick

tiger tiger uppercut
Directly to the gut, when I strut on mics, makes my windpipe erupt
Better back off, I jack off of wack MC's in the vicinity
Nigga please, I make em bounce

Let's organize, c'mon (we gotta bounce) we gotta bounce

I make you stomp back and forth like an army brigade
Diode cuts love kid wherever skills is displayed
Raid your block blow your mind like fans
In the summer or like 
Redman, ready to rock
Expanding my cleverness 
on wax, to Japan and back
Ask for Prince and hon I hope ya got
Just five seconds for black Prince to flex
It's not all about sex
I like ears smooth skin and sensitive necks
Victoria's Secret couldn't keep you from the Prince Poe
So peep it when I funky technique it
For those who slept, wake up, ya better make space
Taste the bread I break off, as I take it to your face! Whew
Can you keep up like skeleton watch Organized Konfusion troop up
Li-li-li-li-live with the style that's fly
Prince Po I, flow smooth like Silk so Freak Me
Cause I ain't Shai!
So, O.C., let em know how we go
Come again my friend with another funk flow

Look who just came in, O.C.'s gamin
Crew's I set you up, to lynch for a hangin
Bangin, bodies up in a tree like a pinata
Many, claim masculine, but sport garters
Whose the artist, not video, more-so to Luke
It's like square dancing on your toes so bounce


Well here's a toke one time for you mind
Most just can't cope, dope def, booty nope I woke you up
I poke your brain I poke your main artery
Batter me, with your fattery your flattery will never ever shatter me
Prince Poe, the exec with the intellectual concepts

Up with negative thoughts running straight through my head
Lights red, and I can't make moves, it's hard
And I thought it would have been nice to buy papa dukes some shoes
Niggas try to get over, pressure on my shoulders
Dropped the fat LP in '91 of October
Now that I'm older and my man pops is gone
My focus is stronger, Monch pick up your head, we gotta move on
Do you remember Mr. J used to say the beats was fat
But when it comes to business, nigga don't play
I look beyond all this stress to seek fate
Mad homicides, unemployment rates sky high
Shorty busting caps, cops caught him out there
Daytime drama and his mama didn't care
That's why I should be rapping and packing pistols on the bully
But niggas be stressing me and I ain't paid in fully
So I'm dropping something fatter, not for props
We're respecting the matter, hops
I'm fat, check my stats, Prince drops data for me and my man Pops
Rolls-Royce and myself are always getting mad harassed by the cops
So now I'm in the chop shop creating masterpieces
So it don't matter money what my fronting label releases
Thanks to the streets and my peeps that made me
And the la-la-lee, la-la-lee
We gotta maintain (Repeat 8x)

Now it's been saaaaaaaaaaid, a grown man ain't supposed to cry
So whyyyyyy, are there tears inside my eyes?
I wake up in the morning, it's a new problem
I just can't solve 'em
Yo, extreme kid, I'm telling you man, I'm on the brink of robbin'
Who's that man in the mirror? Ha!
The picture's getting clearer and clearer, ha!
The end is coming nearer and nearer, ha!
Take a good look at what you fear, ha!
Time marches on and it's a new song
It's a new morning, it's a new dawn
Feet don't fail me now, I got to make it to the studio someway somehow
But I need a little bit of nourishment first
I stop at the store to quench my thirst
Why are they watching me buy my juice?
Why must they clock me buy my juice?
Just give me my change and please put my change into my hand
Man would you listen to me if I didn't have a tan?
All you have to do is show some decency
But you want to bring out the beast in me

Stickin flavor, in your grill piece
Pickin fat loops for troops to bop to, when time is ticking
Winding up, here comes the pitch
Prince Po throws strictly fast flows with no specific type of niche
But sometimes you gotta slow down the flow
Blow up the spot and let the whole world know
Here comes the Prince Po with another funky intro
Something to parlay with and ease the mental
Our instrumentals are too much for the average fan
So I bring the Jamaica funk (Uh!) That's what it is
I am too dope, too fat,

Black Sunday,Stress (The Extinction Agenda),1994.0,"Lord, help me out now
We gotta get together
We gotta organize
No matter the weather
It's a Black Sunday, hey

I used to watch my grandmother catch the Holy Ghost in church
For her soul she would search
Five years later now I'm off to work
In a department store, I'm foldin pants and shirts
At the end of the week, lord
Just enough loot to put some cheap sneakers on my feet
That's when I made a promise to my momma I said
""I betcha you see me at the 
Apollo
 one day and I'ma..
Be kickin that fat funk shit;
Black, mackadocious -- 
speakers in the back trunk shit""
Cause the boss is bossing me, that's costing me
To miss classes and I feel he's forcing me
To be a jackass in the future; then, who's gonna shoot ya?
At this point in my life is where I chose to write rhymes
Instead of doing crimes
Nineteen eighty-six to nineteen eighty-nine
Organized Konfusion, did not, get, signed
But we will soon one day, until then
I return at twelve noon on the track, Black Sunday


Yeah, remember losing a loved one, lawwwd help us to make it over
Delete the pork, the cigarettes and forty-nine cent soda
We came a long way and I'm still runnin for my freedom
Still have one hundred miles to go
, escape from the
Crack vials, so, you can feed that baby
I used to ride the elevator with the crazy lady
A year later I made demo cassettes with the Monch
My stick was on the fader, 
rhymes ran out quick so I
Encouraged Monch to start writing rhymes
And Mrs. J cooked dinner
 then we came into same hard times
Sour contract shouldn't have been on the plate
Two apes escaped, 
back to L.A. with our demo tape
The state of mind I was in 
since Paul C died
 is that
I gotta get mines, representin 40 projects so I'm
All-in, gotta make papes and all that
Close my own record deal cause I can't fall for that
Old snake shit, hissin in the grass
For the cash, little cents, intuition listen
If you're missin' my money, my fist you will be kissin'
Damn, I don't even understand

Like to say rest in peace to my man ***

My moms never walked slow
Now she smoke crack, sit back, and listen to talk shows
I hope she don't eat pork fried rice tonight
See, the cholesterol already got my arteries tight
I might select even before she injects her lethal chemicals
To wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
Shit, I'm pissin' in the abdomen
Two and a half weeks old, already thoughts of stabbin' men
Unravelin' plots and plans for thievin' and shit
Immune to the gospel, not believin' in shit
Where the fuck do I go from here
Cuz when the afterbirth disperse it's hard to persevere
I swear I can't fuck with it
She hits about two packs of cigarettes a day and I'm stuck with it
The asthmatic, internally scarred from crack addicts
Who share needles outside in the rain on Craftmatics
And laugh at it
I guess for them it seems funny but soon
I'll be the nigga who kills for petty money presume
Inside this temple of doom we throw the womb
I bloom to be emitted in june, considered a coon
Livin' my life incomplete though
On the edge of destruction, Invetro

I'd rather not be born
Than to be scorned in this world of hate
Where life escape me and stick with me like thorn
Wild like child porn
-ography, the autobi of the unborn

Overshadowed in darkness where curiosity is my light
Fear it but every coherent that there's a fifty percent chance that I might
Not make it in spite of the fact, it's my life
And can't take it, knowin' that I'm losin' this fight
To contradiction
The love with the hatred inviting friction
Umbilically inflicted, watchin' my life go down like Christion
Understand Mommy dearest is confused right now
But my faith brings us through someway, somehow
From now I vow to invest the livin', bow only to God
The coke's tokes and tell-lie-vision violence already got me scarred
Disregard what the devil allowed on my set
This city's number one threat, huh
Bet I could probably run for mayor on some shit like that one day
Or get my hustle on, just like my dad, quiet as kept for the long stay
Flow as a positive form to first step
I want some friends and a ill-ass fuckin' neighborhood rep
600 Benz gooseneck with a nakamichi system in it
Graduated from a rookie, rolled-up windows tinted
Desire presented for ice cream, big wheels, local rented movies
From Power Rangers, Lion King, Toy Story and Goonies
But the bomb, at least that's what I heard
Beyond my 9 to 5's I write a dope rap song
But with your insides gone; the vision is frail
Dreams can't set sail
From all that unprotected sex and cold Ballantine Ales
Oh well, I still prevail, God always has something in store for me
Outside this hell, move on
Torn in the eyes of Allah, scorned when the dawn distortion upon
My abortion clinic visit in the morn

I'd rather be born, shine as the true and livin'
Spawned to live this gift, to the fullest shit is on
Still rethinkin' my position until I'm gone
Mission is to elevate minds
Glisten, destined forever, weather the storm",https://genius.com/Organized-konfusion-invetro-lyrics

Hey baby, you look so good
Why you driving through our neighborhood?
If raps I wrote were cookies, I bet you'd bite a chip
Rookie fetch a product, 'cause it took a long time to ignite

We be the bread and butter making breaking crown facts around
Back cracking gunner sound heart starts to stutter
When the bass pounds butter... like this
Rumbling CD crispy, no hiss

Rush you like Russell, make you flip like Nipsey

 make it to Poughkeepsie with maybe one
Organized take the favor, rated is my tip
To keep my peers motivated with funk, only we rip, see?

Who Stole my Last Piece of Chicken?,Organized Konfusion,1991.0,"""Of all the things my momma used to cook; I liked""
""Chicken!""

You know that chicken I put in the refrigerator last night?
Well I expect to find it when I get home this evening!

Damn it really hurts my heart to remember these (remember these)
Days way back in the seventies (seventies)
The only AIDS you used to know was Kool-Aids
Corn-bread, corn-rows, and corn-br-AIDS
Pull up a chair, read a book like Dr. Seuss
Peel off the skin, eat all the meat
Nibble on the bone, and then suck the goo
Man if my mother was the Colonel, her chicken woulda sold
It even taste better the next day cold
Chick-chicken... chick-chick-chick-chicken
When I collect my thoughts I recollect
I used to listen to my moms (to my mommy)
""Damn it!"" everyday
""Boy you better clean up your room before you go outside and play""

Yo Monch, you can remember when we used to play skelly way back
Blastin' wax, side or tops, Prince don't play that
Uh-oh, it's six o'clock, I'm late for dinner
If my girl wasn't his girl, I was definitely in her
Got in them print skirts (yo, you was feenin' for a chicken fix)
Ran in the kitchen and put my finger in the cornbread mix...
Mom yells dinner's ready, 'cause she's the boss
All I needed was my ketchup, and my hot sauce
And my cornbread, now I'm ready to dig in
Pick the meat off the bone, and then I ate the skin

""And I’ll tell ya another thang
Somebody stole my piece of chicken!""
""And I’ll tell ya another thang
Somebody stole my piece of chicken!""

Round up, round up, one, two, three
I'm fresh out of the batch, and you can't catch me
Mrs. Mary Mack, all dressed in black
She's rather fat, and she carries a bat
She's the nosiest lady on the block when it's hot
Cops get shot when we played SWAT
But no one never died though, we just cried
Only to laugh again when my moms made fried...

Chicken barbecues in the summer was the move
Whoo! Hah hah, hah hah hah, Grand Groove
Was the jam Grandmaster Vic played in the park
Past the dark, I seen the spark, so did me, Troy and Mark
Went to the rib shack, ordered chicken and the collard
Greens but there's no money left in my wallet
But I kept fifty cents for my juice (word?)
Now we would go to Troy's house and get loose... (uhh)

I'm just looking out of the window (window)
Watching the asphalt grow (grow) slow (slow)
My best friend was a G.I. Joe
Although he had bald spots in his afro
Play with the kids your own age, that's what they used to tell us
I got jealous, when we couldn't run with the big fellas
Bullies on the block used to beat us
I was quick as a cat, in fact I was a cheetah
Especially when we played, follow the leader
Little Suzy May Robinson
Used to play show and tell with my peter...

I used to rock my British Walkers to church
After the choir sang the preacher started to preach
So I had to search
For a pen and some paper to keep myself occupied
But the aroma from the kitchen came and sat by my side
And said, ""MmmmmMMM! You know I smell good""
I said to myself, ""Please, oh please, reverend now would
You speed up the sermon so I can determine
Whether I'ma have peas or collars greens
With my chicken that I'm yearnin'""
Turnin' to the usher in the back, whispering
""Please keep the chicken monster from coming through
The crack of the door!"" Later at the table
Moms popped my hand until it was sore
'Cause I ate the chicken, before
The preacher said grace, but I'm ready to go for self
But there's not one piece of chicken on the table left
(What happened to that wing, man?)
(Where that chicken go?)
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
(Where that chicken go?)
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
Chick-chick-chick-chicken
Chick-chick-chick-chicken

""You know that chicken I put in the refrigerator last night?
Well I expect to find it when I get home, or else!""
""And I’ll tell ya another thang
Somebody stole my piece of chicken!""
""I didn't take your chicken Pop""

Just wait til I get home, cause ain't no chicken left

Walk Into the Sun,Organized Konfusion,1991.0,"The sun reflects off of the waves at sea
Rain support roots that implants the tree
There's a breeze - in the park, kites fly high
Under the branches, convertibles fly by
The sky...

...blue, fields green
Paints a picture that creates a scene
Of the destiny that controls my fate
Reflections of light, creates shapes

Inside of this particular sphere, I see kids in the street
When I pass I go: Beep! Beep! Beep!

See the black boy over there runnin' scared
His old man runs numbers summers
Come in and he'll feel dumb if his son
Doesn't have a new pair of sneakers
So he combinates people's numbers in sequence
When play straight, but not in the leaders

Hip-Hop pumps inside of Jeeps and cars
It's daytime but we still peep stars
Parties every night, we gotta move, we gotta go
We gotta step, let's jet!

We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun! Ha hah
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun!
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun! Ha hah
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk- in- to- the- sun

Love and hate, black and white
Right or wrong, who is right?
Some smoke joints to anoint their brain
To the vanishing point, so they won't go insane

Mother may I? Yes, you may
Take two giant steps to go out and play
I got next, sorry Duke, I got my five
You better call next and step to the side

There's no specific topic of speech in this rhyme
I just wanna go on a ride
On a kaleidoscopic tree, visually

Individually, we go our separate ways
To get our haircuts and moustaches trimmed
Rockin' a t-shirt, shorts with thick socks
With my boots that I nickname Timber
Here comes they fall
I can remember when we used to chill and hang
With Paul C

We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun! Ha hah
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk- in- to- the- sun

Sittin' on a stoop while the Johnny pump shoots
Water while we eat fruits
The radio pumps, rockin' to L.O.N.S. and yes
The girls display flesh by the way they dress

The Ave surprises, the fulfilling collage
Of scratches that strike like sticky matches
Attacking techniques with combinating
Constantly motivating highly elevating your light steps

When the air gets thick and you can feel the tension
I bypass Howard and detour Benson
'Cause I don't really feel like fencing today
So I chill in my own dimension and listen to the sax blow
Flow, abstract the sax always seems to relax you
But at the same time it attacks you
In this particular era of darkness
Bust a rhyme that might enlighten the mind and spark this
Trail to follow the light that's guiding you from
The evil that you walk into the sun
From what I see it's an addiction
I'll explain to the brain about pain affliction
Grab my hand, hold it tightly
Close your eyes and maybe you might see what I see
Yo, what I said simplistic
But what I see's not materialistic

My hay fever is acting up
So I took a couple of antihistamines (whew!) I got struck
With relief, now patiently I wait for the summer
'Cause the spring brings pollen and that can be a bummer
A terrific brother was havin' a specific get-together by the beach
Rolling Rocks plus Peach Schnapps served on the rocks
The Organisms play the boardwalk, pullin' numbers from Pros' Peak
The scenario, where we go pumpin' the Alpine stereo
Hop along the turnpike on our way to the merry-go
-round up the herbs at six flags; we're on a mission
Hittin' the streets of New York in zig-zags
Walkin' to the park, hark, the herald, named Erald
Who creates with charts
Central Park swarms with intellectual dialects
With the potential of the city's best emergency medical techs
So I dip dip dive
Listen to the musicians in the park play live
The Funky Drummer was drumming even though he was a bum
Some couldn't comprehend the vibe that blended
With the sum, there were some who wasn't dumb
I supported with the hum, dropped five bucks, 'cause he was the one
Yo, I gave a clap, I gave a wink, I gave a shout
I gotta meet the Monch, strike three: and I was out!

Just a hint of memories of last year
Walks on the shore, we just filled with 
No wants for work, all you wanna do is party
I just want to play all day
Don't stress me now because I'm lounging
Tops off the ride, fellas by my side
No worries or cares in here",https://genius.com/Organized-konfusion-walk-into-the-sun-lyrics

We be coming up wit funky fly shit
Like every single day, but uhh

Check it
Intelligent words, is colors inside of this rap vision
Liquidized for precision which cleanses'em like baptism
I bless souls through the worlds’ second religion
From the left with angles to enlarge the prism
Prince Po, I, out of the south-side slums
Claiming spots around all these hypocritical tongues
Repeating the same topic, misleading a seeds optic
With two years outta da picture
I still rock it and rock well
Don't ever let my stiggy get you gel (what?)
I strictly international ghetto, clientele
The freaky black James Bond, with infrared views inject propelling
Once examine, my steps, and with the few
I make power-u's, drop jewels inside of the groups
Inside of under the eyes of God, can't lose
Batter and bruise crews
And let the heat spark, the fuels
Got your boys crying while you're stretched out in front of da church pews
Fools hit the dance floor, to shake shoes
Intergalactic hip hop monster who sucks ooze
Out of the power that I used that to start the party
Want more?
Icky sticky butt naked and raw


Only inches beyond my eyes, lord here lies the soul
Of a nigga who fights the lyrical war with inside himself
Pharoahe, eager to see feeble intermediate MCs
Immediately, deleted repeatedly
Y'all know the unpresidented without herb
Every single word'll be verbally demented
Presented, so that when it disintegrates
No sentiments, I’m imminent
Standin' alone and get your tenement
Isn't it bug how I bust lyrical slugs
At thugs that mug niggas for loot and sell drugs
When the band gets struck by feces
I'm only rollin' wit da most superior profile to my species
See my thesis to release these bombs by all means
Yes, attack the mic raps until it's a crack fiend
Mase the bass with AIDS and misplaced the vaccine
Pharoahe's pullin’ out on the Pope

 Brother why don't you explain
How did Hip-Hop get caught up in this ill rap game?

Yo, I got a question - in Hip-Hop, who they followin'? (Uhh)
The niggas with skills or them niggas who be hollerin'?

Them niggas that be hollerin' is substitute, modelin'
Niggas with skills always and forever keeps a followin'
 Swallowin' pride
 
Never we be imperialistic
 
Who rips shit, without bein' materialistic

What?! Nigga you can consider it the bomb if I spit on it,
 get on it
Ride for a little bit, feel how your inner get
From internet, intellect, vibes that I'm sendin' it
Now your soul bubblin' brown sugar so you'll remember it
Legitimate, imminent, crash course for illiterate
From August to September, Prince is heavenly given it
From center split, train of thoughts that's mad booty
'Cause you twisted and rudey don't mean everything's
GROOVY when you hear it, the world's gonna feel it before I say it
Now some pop some shit, but the labels get the big G's from sales
(Whooo!) Nobody sayin' shit it just smells
Here's some Southside Saturday love like Shamelle's
My syndicate is tight, quite right for these times
Contradictin' all the hype, the berry-more-black shines

I done burned some of the most fattest MC's like chromium percolinate
It's not even tangible for them to understand the holy weight
It takes soul to make a crowd animated
Prince stated, hey wait 'til we get off that label
And I waited twelve months (twelve months) for the perfect opportunity
To thump (thump) bump (bump) somethin loved by my community (c'mon)
I'm movin' on all you punk Bambino bastards
Your style's depleted like muscles without amino acids
I blast kids with mass times matter
Forever clingin' to endeavors defined, clever words
Thus waiting never, frustrating verbs to rip
My rap ratings eradicate (eradicate shit)
For me to take rhythms and mate 'em with rhymes in mating season
Creating shit never before made it
I'm makin' hybrids, created potent enough to open eyelids
And leave pupils dilated, stress is alleviated
Now it's easier, plus economically feasible
For me to leave rap listeners queasy and inebriated
We made it we came, dedicated we rated supreme
Even with or without the cream

Hate,The Equinox,1997.0,"Recognize me nigga, look into my eyes
See raw visualizations of hate reincarnated
In it's most unadulturated form I breathe evil incarnate
Solely for the purpose to mislead, what was once promising seeds
Are now destroyed and replaced with mischievious weeds for greed
The purpose, inseminate the bitches
Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches
Nigga political snitches, Abe me which is
The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious
Yea
Take these keys, that for years were not found
Allowing all Simians to be freed thats locked down
It returns way back to the block
Only to cop more Smack, Rock from cops that act
Not in a manner for you to prosper
You are Ob-so-lete unless
You can handle the ball during a full-court press
When the weak emotion of love fails to bring hope
Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion
Known to mankind HATE!
Awww, you are sadly mistaken if you think my Aryan race
Can be taken out by the likes of you Apes, Kikes
Conservative nigga loving Gooks, Spooks, and Dykes
My Spikes, bald headed white laces
Braces the fact that I'm prepared for vicious acts of war
WHITE POWER!
HATE!

What we have hear is a situation where our government
Is allowing these aliens to take over the country
We can't allow this to happen! Turn your bibles to Psalms 34:21
""Evil shall slay the wicked, and they that hate the righteous
Shall be desolate."" You there!
Young man in the back with your hand up

Who me?

A fucking taxpayer who salutes to a Confederate flag
My chain and thoughts is on the rag
Aryan ways learned from my grand-dad
I'm on my toes around these monkeys and spics
I thank God that I'm white, pure and don't mix
We need to snatch up these niggas and fags, reissue slave tags
Regain job positions, remain in control of opposition
Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot
I'll rape 'em and slave 'and trade 'em from birth
Never to overlook the main crook who disperse shook
Versions of the bible, Sabotaging shit since Christophers arrival
Hate!
Making them Indian pay for survival
Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation
It's exerted in the good book of Revelations
Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood
Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out

But when I envision a black man with thorns in his hand
On a crucifix I get strong
Never will I ever let a devil ever deceive me again (HA!) mislead me
'Cause what I'ma hit you with's gonna hurt (yeah)
Because the flesh is meaningless it remains amongst the dirt

A fallen angel, hark, the rebel
The mark of 6-6-6, the Devil
You better beware 'cause he's comin behind you
No it doesn't take long for him to find you
It's a sneak attack black, he's gonna smack you
In the form of a rock that's inside of a capsule
Or maybe in the form of a man
That says to trust me and then begins to shake your hand
But when you examined your hand you learned
You're alarmed that your palm was disfigured and burned
No no no no, it's not surprising
Open your book, look to the horizon
Start scoping, open your eyes and strive to
Study the holy Qu'ran or read the Holy Bible

For I am blessed with the gift of knowledge (yeah)
Without college, but now let's shift
Into the specific dimension that we call Earth
Where God gave us the gift of birth
Last but not least Ephesians 6 tells you to teach the child
Revelation tells about two-day swarms, the guns and diseases
Homicides over epidemics and crack vials
Got guns going BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK

Yes, for I have seen the light
That shines bright even in the dark of the night
And I (I) thank (thank) thee (thee)
For constantly watching over me
There are about, four hundred and fifty-thousand homeless without housing
Brothers sharing cells and sharing beds
They can't seek a job with this hair that's dread
Sit back and face reality with these lyrics
I hope they can uplift your spirits
(we're living in the last days, we're living in the last days)
'Cause God made water and trees food man woman
Land fire grass animals clouds and sunrays to shine
On the parents of those twenty-six kids that died last year (last year)

Died with pride, he thought he had a big heart muscle
He fought back, but the attack was brutal
Futile to his survival and the event that his crew will
Seek revenge on the assailants who rushed him
They crushed him, snuffed the life all out of his body
He had friends a Benz with rims by Gotti
Guys wanted to beat him, girls wanted to greet him
Kids wanted to be him when they saw him in the Coliseum
Lots of cash hoppin' fast on the Avenue
Pump up your system loud, and he'll laugh at you
'Cause under the TEC is a gooseneck
And a Glock 9, when he stops at the light
Pumpin' rides into the top in

Playing the game of survival, going uptown to pick up
Supportin' the taste with leathers and bamboos and black Timbs
Benz parked at the curb while puffin' herb (word)
Cruisin', one-six-oh, with the lean
Sportin' BVs on the Beamer with the Italian wintergreen in-

Hoppin', hopin' to catch them all open, girls scopin' as you unlock

Personally there's no particular name that's written
On the side of a slug, damn it's bugged
When pretty women begin to bend over a drug
She used to be the type of girl that was flashy
Now the scars from the concrete make her knees look ashy

Cops constantly stay on high speed chases
Trying to remember faces from previous arrest cases
Bulletproof vests is the hottest items to invest in
Shots fired one was hit with the hollow-tip and it caved his chest in

To match the colors inside of your eightball shearling
So today he escapes fate to live another day

Inside of the ghetto cars gather together
Gettin' ready to hop under the summer weather
Armor All glistenin' in the sun, it's four cars
And they're each two deep

Full of Chinese cut broads passin' by perpetrators

Thinkin' about pickin' up a convertible Saab
As the sun sets, you all jet inside of the ride

*Pharoahe Monch whining*

God; why is it so difficult to get it through these niggas heads?
They can't fuck with me, I try to explain to them—they won't listen
Please, Lord; help me make them see
I scatter data that'll catapult a metaphor
The epiticle epilogue editor
Hey, hey, hey
Eaaase back, Whoooo is that, Getting up in your aaaaaass crack?
Ooohhhhh, shit
Say now; who you listen to?
Park your ass like municipal, invisible lyrics
Not difficult to understand, man
Spiritual, hit what you go, back-a-van
Lyricals aren't impossible
All opticals are not inside the plan
Let me see your hand
And if it does not have triple sixes in the palm
Do not be alarmed; I understand, man
My oracle waveband expand from the wasteland to San Fran
Enicidem fo nem eht

You can not oppose me—God has chose me
To battle against evil and win
You can not oppose me—God has chose me
To do battle against all who sin
And even when I'm gone, my energy returns
To it's original form, thus must warn
(All humans who do not meet the required specifications for salvation will perish)

I piss into the face of the crowd, lyrically I squash shit
Toss mic stands and fans, before leaping into the mosh pit
Harshness isn't it? Ha, ha, ha, ha
Exquisite with the style that I be using
Choose to compete, you will lose
Poetical implants placed in my ears
Make me cause a catastrophe to the
Kick, drum, I'm the sinister of
Snail Peak Creek
Never sleep, be aware
Who will escape unscaved
From a bombardment of scattered fragments
Released from hidden compartments
My Termi-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-nology
Is equivalent to Trig-ni-ni-ni-ni-ni-nometry
I leave no optical footprint
Within sight of the stands of time
So it's impossible to follow me
You swallow leave and digest
No nutritional value
Never learn how to bow to the ones
Who allow you to wallow in the mist
Peacefully co-exist
With the men of medicine
The lyrical antagonistic

You can not oppose me—God has chose me
To battle against evil and win
You can not oppose me—God has chose me
To do battle against all who sin
And even when I'm gone, my energy returns
To it's original form, thus must warn

Prince Poetry, the man, not a myth
I'm not the type that you can walk up and eff with
Don't sleep, just peep the whole damn con-cept
I'm out to wreck, sucker MCs steppin' to me with garbage
I'm Goldilocks and I'm taxin' your porridge (yeah!)
Ooooooh, cold but yummy
I slept in your bed, and your girl sucks funny
I'm out to bash beats and drop snares
Crush tables and smash up chairs, yeah
So consider me on a rampage
I spread out and hit ya like a sawed off twelve gauge
So back up, don't play me close
Most boast to be the best, but you can't, and will never
Ever in your life come close to a mic assassinator
I'm playin' you out like Beta
I'm watchin' you front
Flaunt your puss-head lookin' just like bark
This is just a verbal whippin'
For all you who don't fall, but you keep slippin'
Shootin' the gift for the guh-guh-gab
I'm gonna dunk on your neck just like Kareem
Abdul,
 yo and it ain't cool
So don't let me act like a fool
'Cause I'm takin' off from the tip-top of the key
With the rock passed by the Pharoahe M-O-N-C-H
The chosen lyrical soldier that backs me up
When punks verbally and physically try to get over
With no skills, no comp-petition
Havin' you reminiscin' about a brother
Who don't give a damn about dissin'
Black and quite clever like a superstition
'Cause concepts flow with the use of a
Pen, a sheet, and when braincells meet
Brain-bustin' MCs try to get hype but
Smell like doo-doo, 'cause they can't even wipe butt
Stuck-up and quite conceited
Your one hit song all year long at shows
Everybody knows it, 'cause you're gonna repeat it like reruns
Put your iron away, 'cause I got three guns
Now that we've got things up and out in the open
And clear yo, grab a chair
'Cause I swing with a style that's rather ill
The illiterate can't consider it legitimate so I
Kick simplistic rhymes for the plain
For the peanuts, I commence to go insane
Shredder of a competitor, makin' it better for
Rap listeners, 'cause I'm headed for
The top of the hill where Jack can't chill
Just me and Jill, 'cause Jack has no skills
Now tell me why everybody wants to be a Prince
No skills, no sense, nonsense!
I'm steppin' up front, and 
to be quite
Blunt a radical creator of a poetical, hypnotical, mathematical
Slang slurs punch that stuns and amazes
Prince Poetry shoots powerful phrases!
Interrupting your braincells, dilutin' your thoughts
Causin' side effects fully disintegratin' body parts
'Cause I stalk when I pray upon in the form of the flesh
Now weaken when Prince Poetry commence speakin'
Side by side I rock with the Pharoahe
Watchin' you decomposin' MCs, and look there's only a shadow
Too late, 'cause I'm gone, I explode
And I drop a hip-hop again, atomic, atom bomb
Releasin' lyrics that you better not be usin'
Organizin' beats that you find Konfusin'

Yeah, here we go
Aiyyo umm Prince (yo!) Brothers try to swing on me
But I don't think they can hit it (nah)
These styles, MCs they just can't get it (why?)
The way I ar-ti-cu-late my flows (my flows!)
Sometimes I think I know some shit
Some MCs just don't know; the
Quicker I'm kickin' the style
Slippin' and stickin' the words hit quicker
Better figure the verbs are thick in you
While the poetical fanatical rap acrobatical style
Static never had it so I'm packin' a black
Automatic pistol itchy by the C.I.A
By the way, my display of rhymes that I will lay
Down on wax, distributed from a zodiac
Digitally with a funky appeal
From the reel to reel, it doesn't matter
I still got the skill to get ill
Straight literature when you try to hit 'em with your
Wack style, the critics are sore to crack smiles
So back up black, 'cause you lack the skills
When I ask your girl, tax your girl
She said she wanted it from the back so I waxed your girl
So why would you try to swing on a nigga
With a itchy trigger finger better bring a bigger auto
Hit, swing a nigga if you wanna get rid of me (damn)
Your first mistake was to consider me
A new jack black when I already knew that
So get back, step back, move back out of my way
When I roll offbeat (offbeat) again
Again and again and again and again and again
Blending the style, mending it like this
So that you can check it out when I flow awkwardly
Awkwardly I flow, yo, let's go
Most don't recollect me as T-R-O-Y
'Cause I'mma get fly with a microphone
Dope with a microphone, you can't cope with a microphone
'Cause I'mma be illin', buckin' off into your grill and
Fillin' your face with knuckles and watchin' the blood spill in
Down the sewer, always knew I could do a brother
With a crew of good MCs
Or maybe even a few are stale MCs
I scatter data that'll catapult a metaphor

Trendsetter, letters are formin' together
In the jaw inside of my mouth, I'm alphabetic
Call me a librarian, rhymes are scary when
I mix verbs and phrases and put the vocabulary in places

So don't ever despise me
Red is the color when you look in to my Organized
You'll see Konfusion

First she was iggin me son, sliding up in strawberries
Suckin down a sugar cone with nuts, sprinkles and cherries
Excuse me miss, but-uhh pecan

So its cool like that

And I uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh!
Misses, I can't explain how much I want to be up in it
And I know you ain't had no dick in a minute
Oh, you smoke beedies, see you go
Couldn't you see me and you stressed out in bikini's on the beach in Tahiti?
See me I'm very selective even though I could be greedy
My main objective is to write our names together in graffiti
And are be (?) so y'all can see me, speedy

Pharoahe Monch:
This one little chick she pissed me off
Comin out the store, now I'm holdin the door
To the Bodega, she got a little man with her
Figuring if I kicks it to the kid then I could get her right
Say listen
I see you around every night around seven o'clock
You walkin up the block (?) with the rocks on the side of the crib
With your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch
You know the thirst baby
First we can deal with the math if you search through your purse for a pen
We can blast off
Like Hubble Space Craft material
I'm aware of you and your concern about vanirial diseases
If it pleases you, shit, Jesus
I pack profolactics that stretch to my knees
She squinted, with a demented look behind a tented glass of a girlfriend
Rented, Benz E-Class vented hate
But still hinted like I was self centered
She said speak to the hand
Y'all know that shit that girls invented
Aww, see it didn't have to be be like that wit you fiberglass
Backboard ass that's mad flat bitch

Prepare a five course meal while I'm makin the beat
Already got two things in this beautiful universal common
That's lovin a tight ass fuck, and some tight ass rymin

Roosevelt Franklin,Organized Konfusion,1991.0,"Don't forget to do that thing for your mother Roosevelt!
Yeah yeah yeah, alright, alright

Running upon the jagged edge (buck, buck)
The rough life
When you have to gain much respect
As an individual keepin' negativity minimum
Requires havin' courage respect him his intellect
So you gotta be on that specific type of set
Like Roosevelt, especially when your cards are dealt
You see me, frankly, I don't give a hoot
About the blanks you shoot out of your mental bank see
I like Roosevelt, 'cause he ain't booty
Moody maybe, baby you're mad 'cause he snatched up your cutie
Playin' the courts, takin' the loss to wherever
Some clever college edu-ma-cated individual
With financial status just to mess what the bank stated
Girls love it, and you can't look above it, you hate it
Peeped his method, you laid, you waited
You never ever contemplated if I pull an automatic
Millimeter artillery out of your flight
Check in the night, you're out to snipe, my man
You can't stand upon sight of him
Out to fatally ignite him
Roosevelt felt staticky, he knew things were shady
Grady had Bradley's uzi, but he always packed a clip or two
Belongin' to a nickel-plated .380
Givin' off the impression of a clever nerd
Never was a suspect when a homicide occured in the suburbs
He was referred to as a respectable intellectual
Highly acceptable rebel from the ghetto on the level
Of an intelligent rapper, create him just like Geppetto
The aggresive type, and he's not your puppet
Stickin' quick enough to pull a skeezer with repetition
After takin' aim and buckin' him, blowin' the smoke away
Then tuckin' and jettin' home
Hopin' that no stunts are stuck in it
He needs sleep for eight o'clock class
So as fast as he crash, he might last
For six hours of bed passed, 'cause Roosevelt's a scholar
Ivy League material, cully-head kid with brainpower
Six foot two, and we wear the same size shoe
He drinks brew, and he runs with my crew, my herd
On a continuous basis, in the same places
Rollin' out five deep, but it's only four faces
So I don't give a two drip-drops about what those have felt
And if I die (and if he die) and if I die (and if he die!)
And if I die it's because of my man Roosevelt

Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin
Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin, Roosevelt Franklin
Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin
Roosevelt, Roosevelt, Roosevelt Franklin, Roosevelt Franklin

Oooh, I'm so confused
Damn, it hurts!
People persist to treat me like dirt
I don't sleep at night time 'cause dimes I don't drop
I sling and clockers cease
Commanders in Chiefs when I pop rocks
Dig deep within, you might recognize me
I'm the one with the bloodshot eyes
Hot rays of sun beat down upon my face as if I'll melt bacon
Why the hell my mother named me Roosevelt Franklin?
I don't know, so I strive to gain
Only the Lord knows my eyes have seen the pain
Tears comin' down my cheeks like rain
I was abused, they stripped the mind for amusement
Now I walk the path of Organized Konfusion
But it's only a temporary formality
'Cause my man Scott turns illusion into reality
A loaf of bread (a loaf of bread), a stick of butter
Somebody's mother lies, dead in the gutter
So I move quick fast to get past quickly
Swiftly, at last cops can't get with me
Can't hit me, nah never I'm too nifty, people shittin' me
Products in the projects so I pump fifties
In soda cans so dogs won't sniff me
I'm takin' the proper precautions (yeah)
'Cause once my mother told me she was gonna get an abortion
I can't keep track of the fluctuation of time
Hallucinogenics keep abusin' my mind
Gotta pick up, gotta pick up, gotta pick up, gotta pick up
More product, gotta move, gotta go, I can't get stuck; not here
Not if I wanna become Roosevelt Franklin: the employee of the year
I wear baseball caps over my eyes so you can't make out
Me at night when I'm standin' on the corner eatin' Chinese takeout
Damn I almost forgot, yo, yo I have to break out

Yo don't forget your moms told you to get that stuff
A loaf of bread, a stick of butter, container of milk
A loaf of bread (a loaf of bread) a stick of butter (stick of butter)
Umm... container of milk (container of milk)",https://genius.com/Organized-konfusion-roosevelt-franklin-lyrics

I'm so confused! I don't know what to do
I think I'm going insane! My brain
Is on the brink of destruction, I’m looking for some 
Victims to stick 'em up and shake 'em down
If my friends could see me now—they’d wonder “Why? What? Who?""
—and ""How?” I’m living underneath, amongst the homeless;
The outcast bastards of the barren wasteland (Wasteland)
For days and days, I fast, fighting
Over scraps and rats, trapped in a society
Of the living dead (For ten—)

The tiger inside of me screams (Ahhhhh!)
My claws touchin' the mic for keeps, st-ress!
Keeping me up when the shitty city sleeps—a Southsider
Quick to peep undercovers in Chevrolet high-beams
Duo-teams love harassin' Po in the streets, I'm for forty
PJs, New York—no pork—uh-uh, freaks in New Orleans
See me get bagged by some ol' Uncle Tom-DT
In Louisiana streets, disrespecting my origin (Ohhhhahhh!)
Now, it’s my turn (I'm so confused!), I'm—coming
—back, so, fuck you!
Fuck you racist cats, store-owners, waitresses, construction-workers (All of you)

The particular way that I've kicked it
Smooth (mmm) is it not? (Yup!)
Is it dope? (Yup!) Is it hype? (Mmm-hmm) Is it hot?
Easy for you to hum along to whenever I'm rappin
Keepin your feet, tappin, and keepin your hands
Comin together 
you may think you're nice but I am Alpha Beta
Glee and clap on the microphone, to kick a rhyme like, this one..

Artistical formulas, label me as a hip lyric professor
Pressin to be the one a lyrical chauvanist
Study facts my brother, read all about it
Cause Prince Poetry and Monch gets on down undoubted!
Somethin smooth yes, prepare for the audience pleasers
United together, through thick and thin forever
Just for the people's pleasure
This is something new for you
We are.. the simply too positive MC's

Design a rhyme like an inventor
Intertwine, combine the centrifugal forces in the center
Giving it a steady a flow, who's like dope (you are!)
Better yet, I'm like acid
Cooler than Lake Placid
You're loving it when I'm passing it off, slick (slick)
So that you know (so that you know)

Well it's me, your majesty, Prince Po, I flow
Like spring water out of a faucet when I complete it
The text like toss it cause I will toss it to the Pharoahe
Capital M, lowercase O, then the N, then the C-H
Witness the presence of the two N-E-W
Intellectual through rhythm I went interjectin you
A few messages, paragraphs, stories, a few laughs
When it comes to steppin yo there ain't no quarters
Or even a half like poison, I subject to feed you venom
I find em, line em up, I fold em up, and Monch will KILL EM!

Curteous! Givin a high-five or handshake
But I can flip, like a chef at the House of Pancakes
When I speak, I create a new strange tongue
MC's clingin I bring on a new swing and they swung
Off the tip I'm well equipped to stick to the cut when rhymin
The kind of emcee you'll find, with the mind of a minister
Chronological timing or maybe Simon Bar Sinister

Hmmm, mm mm mmm! Yo
Sometimes I'd rather stop acceleratin and flow
To a slowwwwwwwer tempo sit back relax bust the
Introduction that you're sleepin on, I must awaken you
Now come with us cruise in, 'cause me and Monch
Is takin you to another dimension, keepin you up to par
Look up to me as an advisor
Much wiser than the average rap star/struck you
Not as another but a brother who's hype
Sim-pl-ly too positive MC's too dope too trife
To comprehend, this is finally the end

'Til death play its part and we transform back
To the essence until then our presence is all that
We seizin 40 acres right the fuck off the map

(Now who's the first incision it's an interlocked position) Indeed!
Flexin' a lie, spittin' and switchin' on positions
Coverin' the strong safety, bubblin' in Macy's
Lacin' tracks by Niq, the antidote is complete
The bass like the chisel, crash the walls of the Jeep
Delight in personnel as they romp in the street
Intent is to bend, non-understandin' in those that peep
Automatic is static across the beat

With vintage fortified material antiques for lyrical
Shit I can feel the vibe inside my soul like a spiritual sermon
Never difficult to determine, examine
My verbal prognosis easily equals that of a blast from a cannon
(BLAOW!) So fuck chronic

It's the deadly demonic, I'm playin hydroponic
That make a nigga and his man react, like they supersonic
It's the lyrical program murder assault area
Shake crack, shatters down barriers

Ghetto life in the form of a SCUD missile (hittin ya area)
Heat-seakin' where are ya, infrared rays are starin ya
Down to wear out your movements in spirit and sound
True and living


We still remain rough rugged still strugglin' jugglin' bombs
Shovin' in Tommy riddle times are troublin' we still bubblin'
The black magic without, magic wands, the bonds we on
Droppin mega jewels on third eyes like smart bombs

Now most kids can't figure the fudge, they can't deal with
My vertical liftoff, or poison progress
Attack future fighters laser light point dot is
Hostile radar (and move on any invader)

They're merkin', awkward shadows are clerkin'
Lurkin' from resistin' in arrest, put in my 10, I'm workin'
For the ultimate hurtin', my steel curtain
Will block your entourage, sincerely, for certain

So how you prove who you are? (Who you are?)
We got individuals, mentals mixed with visuals, subliminals
Attributed to, love and understanding for my group
Bassline tragedies over mackadocious loops
Lackin the notions, motions granted we hopin
(And just copin' to exist with lyrics that's like mist)

Estabalition, cinco, seperate accounts, Swiss
Five individual rolos, ex..quisite isn't it

Who explained to me that DT's got the block locked seized
They wouldn't let us in
Sighed, slide to the midstream, plus swallow your pride
(This is the second time swine, one-time, had to spoil it)
Pull the lids on the commode and drop the Glocks inside the toilet
If we, move swiftly, we just might make it
If the opportunity arise to bounce, let's take it",https://genius.com/Organized-konfusion-confrontations-lyrics
Decisions,America Is Dying Slowly ,1996.0,"Artist: Organized Konfusion
Album: America Is Dying Slowly: A Red Hot Organization compilation
Song: Decisions
Chorus:
The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife
Decisions and moves you make gotta be precise
Step careful son watch how you roll your dice
The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife
Decisions and moves you make gotta be precise
Thinkin that you the man and you might see ice
And that ain't nice
(it's like that and uh
It's like that and uh)
Verse One: Pharoahe Monch
Never exceeding my recommended dosage
When it comes to licking, selecting, chicken
It's never what it seems when you're picking
Cause you can't tell from the eyes
Especially now they seperate the legs from the wings and thighs
Ain't no surprise in it
You get it, with, cellophane wrapped tight over the meat
They be like disguising it
I'm sort of sticking to my old ways (true)
Keeping my order score the chicken dark nowadays
Even believing in retrieving in my own chicks
It's, no need to be rude (shit)
I let the butcher chop it up and key food
And hit her with the keys if she's On Bended Knee like Boyz II Men
I tell her I don't want to catch some vanilla poisoning
I'm poised and when... it's the opportune time
Before I stuff my face
Kneel my head over my plate, then I say my grace
Pray up above
Slip on my rubber glove and dine
Polish off the meal and enjoy some wine
Relax recline
Yeah
Chorus
Verse Two: Prince Poetry
Aiyyo most def, you know I love, gettin it on
(but not without the stretch)
Don't need to be making that three letter catch (cool)
Careful who I choose to make ooohs
Better believe me love (we living in the paradise of fools)
Yo Pharoahe (right?) Remember I met Yvette in Dallas, Tex
(That cool queen long blonde chick with mad connects? No quest)
Oh yes, she hooked hooked us to the game cuz strange shit
Was going down in town
There was a pretty dear packin pound cakes
A cocoa butter babe with papes jewels a black Ac
And mad niggas was liking that
Players tricking on that chicken and slippin
And never to go far; cause Shante had the scar
Now everybody knew why motherfuckers started droppin
But nobody knew Shante's ex-husband, was needle poppin
And on the other side of town, medical records was lost
Blood samples was crossed and doctor's mix-ups was found
Yvette said, ""The six o'clock news covered the scam""
Three families blew the fuze
It was a psycho doctor at hand and insanity rules
Only two to lay five on that man, and he's singin the blues
He sings the blues, he sings the blues
We're living in the world of frus... tration plus
The lies lust gluttony and mistrust
Situations we discuss about world domination reflect...
...guns money greed and sex it all connects like a puzzle
In the game of life, in the game, in the game of life
In the game, in the game of life
The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife
Decisions
The greatest thing in this world is life
And life is full of pain struggle and strife

You Won’t Go Far,Hidden Gems,UnKnown,"I figure the configurations on exactly
How many steps it'll take before I get to the passenger side of the car
Break through the glass, smash the window
Put your hands on the dash, bitch

I reveal Clyde, stick up your ride, give it up
Put it in park baby, don't let me spark that ass
Cry, you die, pout, no yelling or shouting or doubting my itch
No time for thinking, honey, make the switch
Move over, your end is near, fear me

I speaks clearly, I didn't stutter
I shudder to think the thoughts that would eventually
Shatter the hammer that tips the back of the rounds
And splatters the face in blood and stops the heart that pounds
Pain seems quite excruciating
When I think of how long I was legally waiting
Anticipating you to stop

Causing terror throughout the late night
Seeing the flashing of the brake light
Door's ajar on the car but she takes flight
As a vice with tight grip, my joints almost torn from my arm
I must warn

If you're worshipping Range Rovers (You won't go far!)
Yo rims go for dough, kid (You won't go far!)
Wherever you live, whoever you are
The system's a trap, Jackson (You won't go far!)

Once this black man's inside a sedan
I keep my hands fishing for the ignition to ignite
Before I kiss my .38 snub (Why!) Because I love to
Then I cut the steering wheel (How come?) To pull the club through

Now should I make an interstate escape
I cruise around to take time to make plans
A proper move is needed
Weeded but I don't lose focus, Jakes swarm like locusts
I'm hoping the pressure don't choke us

Daddy dearest he be nearest to me in his infectious Lexus
Splitting image and I'm highly respected
Game time disappear you always by my side
Few days later car reappear, mama's in fear
Ruler crime don't limit celebrity limelight
Funkadelic got jacked, them niggas caught 'em for spite

Struggle and fight, lost life, nor foresight nor light
Shed on that Bronx man's wife on the New Jersey turnpipe

(North, South, West to East), car jacks must cease
A kidnap took place, he accidentally grabbed my niece
In the backseat, facsimile was Emily
Jack a figure you provoke, fronting in Infinity
Identity of yours don't mean nothing
Double example get a clap me down and handcuffing

Now if you worshipping Legends, baby (You won't go far!)
Momos attract thiefs, Po (You won't go far!)
Wherever you live, whoever you are
The system's a trap, Jackson (You won't go far!)",https://genius.com/Organized-konfusion-you-wont-go-far-lyrics
Chuck Cheese,The Equinox,1997.0,"When you deal with the other side, you see things
They warn you, they let you know, about your friends around you
People around your circumstances
One must have belief in order to believe
One must see in order to know
These little things I tell you is what's kept me here
Is what's made it, possible, for me to tell you this story

Chuck Cheese! Everybody neighborhood's fuck-up
A wild shorty, touched, heads got stuck up
Under the trestle wrestle with your chains 'til your neck muscle
Veins pop out, GIMME, paper cut your bled vessels
So what you real? He'll test, no question
Always on the ave in plex mode, impressin
Baby girl with jewels and his pretty boy complexion
He was makin them lose their minds, packin two-two's
Ready for testin plus prime time
Stickin your ATM, expert, vickin your two-week's work
Jerk settle for lickin ya if any funny moves is made
Known through the PJ's for puttin bodies in graves
All over the tri-state, now why wait, when crime pays
That's what he started sayin from way back in the days
He had plans, to stick up the bully, and his mans
But got caught up with the heat
When jake rolled up in two fifty passenger vans
(Aiyyo! Aiyyo! Get up off me man
Get up off me. I didn't do nuttin man!
Yo, yo, whassup yo? What's the problem?
What's the problem?)
{*""thugs bustin slugs.."", ""shorty's down for his respect""*}

Anyway after puttin in three or three-to-five
You thought Chuck would be happy just to be alive
Now thoughts of cash (?) connections
Occupied his mind first, a nigga didn't waste time gettin work
When he seen the scheme gettin less green
Chuck Cheese got grimy, him and about fourteen
Was countin paper on the line at Green Acres
And behind them was the shiny link, it's victim, a move-faker
And so they caught him on the way to the car
In the parkin lot a shot was heard from afar (whassup now sup now?)
Money's grazed, shameless, without all of the frontin
Chuck, you know the one with the new link he's now manhuntin
For more, who get ten G's a wop, on the low
From two hot shot spots in Hollis bold G's that stole
Pushin weight, through the (?) Metro, he's contracted
Twenty's a hit on his head, jealousy didn't like the way that he acted
Now Chuck heard the news and got attracted
Ready to bring racket to the wrong full metal jacket
Bold, he got some love on the street, he knows about it
Now a tactic or patient retaliation is routed
He gets outted!
(Yo f'real, this little skillet-head nigga
Runnin around disrespectin, you know how we get down on Southside
Word to strength, he gots to go. I don't care HOW it happens!)

Yo, the word got back, to my highest of rank
This cat's burnin my ears son, his suicidal tendencies
Got me askin about him, the word on the street is
Y'all ALL wanna out him, all present and accounted
There ain't no way around this dilemma, he's stoppin cheddar
Seen the better part of life so yo he keeps a baretta
But all we gotta do is, follow plan A through
To the letter, y'all choose the in and outs on you

And just two days later Gator and Chuck was creepin up Sufton
Out of the dark called yo Chuck they advanced and started buckin
(What the fuck?) He screamed with no time for duckin, six struck
Rules even apply in these mean streets nigga with no discussion

Late Night Action,Soul in the Hole  (Original Music From and Inspired by the Motion Picture),UnKnown,"No question we doin this shit once more, once more
Intro/Chorus: all together
The mic strikes, the main event, there's no dull moment
They frail cause their shell lack one component
That's the motive of locs, big payback shit
Organizin, for your Late Night Action
(repeat 2X, substitute fourth line in first repeat with ""Organizin"")

I'm comin through to administer sinister, effects
Funky ghetto intellects, infrareds and the tecs
Cause foes envy, look for the Remi I had it in me
Bark loud with the dogs like them frogs on ?skinny spinday?

Gimme gimme, you sweet get licked like Yum-Yum's
Run up on your set with pumps and dum-dum's
I let a nigga shine with his glass house image
Cause everything he own is us, with percentage

Aiyyo I never sold coke (what?) Never cut class (uhh)
Never shot handbrawl but I smoke a little grass, who?
Clever with the math, Queens remember boom bash tricks?
When it comes to rap, Pharoahe gets up in that ass quick
Chorus: repeat 2X

We on the creep, gotta eat, on this level of next
Hold it down control the frequency in cash and sex
Another beat, hit the street, neat deposit the checks
Baby-girl, freak to this up in those discotechques
When we get on people say, ""Hey, yo—they ain't no joke.""
But these emcees steady-schemin', lookin all down our throat
Organized and Ill Rahlos got your bubble on float
Now think about but overall nigga consider it broke

Premeditated combustible, skills variated
In the chamber of the cockback, waiting to be fragnated
Just in case it's deadly the occupied skated
Then faded into a state, that made them obligated to wild
Motherfuckin mic striker, I splash with the rubber grip
Rapid fire Star Trek phaser, ain't nuttin over here
Mickey Mouse Phantasia, get your mouth
Filled with blood, tryin to fuckin front like Frasier

Blaze ya, like the finest herbs imported from Asia
My laser, kinetics cuts ass like a razor
Prince the major I'm H-Bomb, ready to burst
With ambidexterous rhythms for your auto-reverse
Chorus: repeat 2X

Main event, mic strike, the holdin down the shit bit
I'm hip, caught the wire they were bringin in equipment
(Bring it On motherfucker) who the mojo, launched from a distance
How could get grant union, infiltrate with precision
Nigga you could get your ass slammed, get your ass slammed
Niggas lyrics is funny like 
FuncoLand
But not my mens we Organized legendary
Slicin devils or bustin pushin bitches off the ferry

Very spectacular rap, vocabulary vernacular
Shit I'mma get the rhythm precise, that of an accurate
Splice to tape, be calibrated like a mechanic
SAY IT SON! You borough nigga my aerodynamics is all that

You know how my herd play love, you better move somethin
Money grillin gruntin, playin the role frontin
Get off the wall, come have a ball, killer move somethin

Now hey heY hEY HEYYYY!
We gonna rock a little bit like this I say (ha!)
Cops lingerin, singlin me out for figurin
Thoughts of stranglin me up, while I'm just single and minglin
With my crew (true) we sing-a-long to shing-a-ling
Bring along a friend if she don't mind seein the ding-a-ling
The ting-a-ling-a-ling, school bell ringin
Niggas back up, when the Monch starts singin
Mii mii mii, now I yearn
Aiyyo! Get off the wall and get concerned
We bout to move this planet I'm f'real god damnit!
Any MC's left standin without skills get reprimanded
And branded with out logo, Organized for dolo
Without affiliation the crews duo teams and solos
 w/ minor variations

We the employees of the year, yeah we back again
We took time off, to get our business shit correct

Select, directions so we can all connect
Collect, the shack before we start to catch wreck
Most want to be but dem can't see such
Still makin moves kid I'm mad quick on the clutch
Prince (Poe!) rebel of rap black knight with the Pharoahe
I take flight and ever since day one, niggas was tight
Now I, shuffle hands you and your mans never dealt
Organized is on the wax, wax upon felt
Imbicilic MC's get treated like a tuna melt
They gettin ate rate us at top speeds, of a stealth
Jet fighter in light of a million two-thousand and eight
I'm Jet Screamer baby, ""Ahh ahh"" I make you bounce rock skate
Roll take 'em off the glass, I'm moldin new ashes (what?!)
When Southside's finest commence to lace this
Party now it's bubblin (ehh ehh) I'm strugglin
With this Henny and cherries I bury, adversaries

Peeping game now I'm the nigga that you smashin up
Prince Poetry:
Damn sis, you lookin kinda, extra
Diggin your cat strut and your beautiful cocoa carribean texture
Savin all the small talk lecture, for chump light
You know deep inside I wanna sex you like no other
Chasin you down Jamaica Ave
A ghetto dope Cleopatra, nigga shorty was bad
First she was iggin me son, sliding up in strawberries
Suckin down a sugar cone with nuts, sprinkles and cherries
Excuse me miss, but-uhh pecan
Can I get a lick?
I be the Prince Po, the rebirth of slick
So its cool like that
Me and you can make it all that, four flat
Into this elevator exotic world with the tall black
Ghetto dope Don Juan ready to see reflections in Amazon rivers with ya blue
Watters
Matchin straw hat, see the picture
Love it but it ain't perfect
We can exchange this data and later respectfully work it
Wheew!
I'm nothin but a space aged freak who wanna beam you up later this week
So baby whats the word

Damn, it's like
Uhh,uhh, a feeling that I get inside
Hard to explain it , I'm getting tongue tied like
I hate when I wheez, stublin over the words
Mumblin, fumblin over my opening line
Jumblin rhymes together, you know my palms get all sweaty
And I uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh, uhh!
Misses, I can't explain how much I want to be up in it
And I know you ain't had no dick in a minute
Oh, you smoke beedies, see you go
Couldn't you see me and you stressed out in bikini's on the beach in Tahiti?
See me I'm very selective even though I could be greedy
My main objective is to write our names together in graffiti
And are be (?) so y'all can see me, speedy
(naw see)
You can be my centipede like we-be-fore-play
Cause I gourmet my food up like eatie and Maxwell
Similar to that smooth kid's C-D
Monch, easily the most measily unmistakable
Believe me
Chorus
Pharoahe Monch:
This one little chick she pissed me off
Comin out the store, now I'm holdin the door
To the Bodega, she got a little man with her
Figuring if I kicks it to the kid then I could get her right
Say listen
I see you around every night around seven o'clock
You walkin up the block (?) with the rocks on the side of the crib
With your kid on ya hip and ya close top notch
You know the thirst baby
First we can deal with the math if you search through your purse for a pen
We can blast off
Like Hubble Space Craft material
I'm aware of you and your concern about vanirial diseases
If it pleases you, shit, Jesus
I pack profolactics that stretch to my knees
She squinted, with a demented look behind a tented glass of a girlfriend
Rented, Benz E-Class vented hate
But still hinted like I was self centered
She said speak to the hand
Y'all know that shit that girls invented
Aww, see it didn't have to be be like that wit you fiberglass
Backboard ass that's mad flat bitch
Shugah Shorty why you backin up, got a nigga out here iggy actin up

Sparkin it, rockin it, ""uhh, uhh-uhh,"" rockin it

How you do?
Get out the car, lemmie see you
Now what's your name?
Hurricane G: ""Star""
Prince Poetry:
Body was bizarre, yo Star, where you live?

Rockaway Beach out in the boons
My niggas put five on it and stack all I like the Loons
Packin twos
So Pappi what you say?
Prince Poetry:
When I'm grown I don't hump, I bone
I ain't playin
I'm a man who likes a treat
Message feet of the independent Queen
To throw up some heat
Shit girl I can fix you something to eat
Prepare a five course meal while I'm makin the beat
Already got two things in this beautiful universal common
That's lovin a tight ass fuck, and some tight ass rymin
So what
We into somethin or your frontin, pilgrum
I ain't askin a protif be for make children
I'm skilled in body messages and sexual healin
