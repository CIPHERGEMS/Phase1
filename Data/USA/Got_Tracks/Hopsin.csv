Ill Mind of Hopsin 5,Ill Mind of Hopsin Saga,2012.0,"Man, I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
Who walk around bumpin' 
Raw
 with the shit blarin'
Saying ""Fuck school!"" and droppin' out like a miscarriage
I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed
I played a part in this devilish game
Makin' your common sense perish
But I ain't takin' the full blame
'Cause most of you chumps runnin' around here ain't never had strict parents
All of your brain cells rottin' from weed
You feelin' like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You havin' sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets, thinkin' you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead, so you just follow the sheep
Makin' sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like, ""Yeah, he got it from me""
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word ""fun,"" what do you envision?
Probably drinkin' and smokin' out with your crew and chillin'
With clueless women you tryin' to bang, bumpin' New Edition
Is that all you think life really is?
Well, if so, then you're a fuckin' idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain — give me it!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from baggin' these hoes and packin' a bowl?
Well, let me guess — no
You're only in school because your parents make you go
When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with the bros
Yo, society's got you livin' for a whack cause
You're a fuckin' adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw — you literally do nothing at all!
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have, 'cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is, ""I got money and it's stacked to the roof""
And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you?
How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor
You pick somethin' up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
Then you complain about your life 'cause it ain't gettin' catered
Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater?
You wanna succeed, you have to try; or one day you'll get older
And regret it all 'cause you can't provide
Your friends are lowlives, don't act surprised
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

Girls, stop actin' like you want a guy
With traits like Romeo — bitch, that's a fuckin' lie!
You always talk about how every man's fake and you can't take it
And you want somethin' real — shut up, tramp, save it!
Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
And head to the club half-naked with your ass shakin'
Pullin' a lowlife nigga who claim he cash-makin'
'Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
You want Romeo, then act patient
And stop frontin' like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
It's the club, where guys put on a new persona
After they get loaded with a few Corona's
They always shoutin' and wild out
With habits that very few condone of
Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry
Talkin' about, ""Oh my god, I can't find a guy!
I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried!
Why am I even on Earth? I should die!""
You want Romeo, you're not worthy
You're cock-thirsty, you're nasty and probably got herpes
Sometimes the secret to findin' is to stop searchin'
Try a new formula, 'cause your last one's not workin'

The term ""real nigga"" is publicly used
And I need to know what it means, 'cause I'm fuckin' confused
Are you one for always bustin' your tool
With nothin' to lose and somethin' to prove
To homies up in your crew?
Is it because you're sellin' drugs to get loot
And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
Like it's fun to be you?
But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustlin' through?
Nah, you hamster-ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve?
'Cause you in the streets actin' like a neanderthal
It's clear you can't stand the law
You're lost as an abandoned dog
And all you're interested in is fightin', rappin' and basketball
I can't even fuck with you
'Cause if we out in public, you gon' get caught stealin' some shit, and get my ass in trouble, too
You'll get old and be nothin'
Livin' life in these streets, thuggin'
And starting shit with anybody mean-muggin'
Look at you, a real nigga, thinkin' your life's cool
Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
Your ""real nigga"" talk seems bogus
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
And his future doesn't seem hopeless
A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit and he keeps focused

To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song
You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
See, this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
Hope the hour is long when I'm rollin' out with your tongue
The man above is my guide,
 you know the power is strong
All you menacin' freaks are only in it for cheese
And the mass-control limit was breached — fuck hip-hop!
They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
They purposely makin' the innocent weak
My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me
Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
It is hard, and sometimes I struggle tryin' to reveal mine
I can guide you if you feel blind
I just need you to be willin' to journey into my ill mind",https://genius.com/Hopsin-ill-mind-of-hopsin-5-lyrics
Ill Mind of Hopsin 7,Pound Syndrome,2014.0,"It's us, find power
Live life, mind power
It's us, find power
Live life, mind power

Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm
Life is a tour, I sit and ride along
Takin' some notes and then I write the songs
I’m starin' down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fuckin' me up, and I cried a pond
While asking you for some answers
But we don’t have that type of bond
That my desires gone with the way that I’ve been livin' lately
If I died right now, you’d turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sell-out
'Cause I hopped to Christianity so strongly, then I fell out
Now I’m avoidin' questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feelin' so damn humiliated
'Cause they lookin' at me like I’m hellbound
What story should I tell now? I’ll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fuckin' edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are you? You never showed the proof
And I’m only fuckin' human, yo, what am I supposed to do?!
There’s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Beggin' all fuckin' men and women to listen
I can’t even beat my dick without gettin' convicted
These ain’t wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itchin' to get it, I’ve been given assistance
But the whole fuckin' system is twisted
Now I’m dealin' with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I’ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can’t buy it, it’s just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer, and humans can’t provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It’s truly mind-blowin', I can’t deny it
Is Heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Where’s the Holy Ghost at? How long’s it take a man to find it?
My mind’s a nonstop tape playin' and I can’t rewind it
You gave me the Bible and expect me not to analyze it?!
I’m frustrated and you provoked it
I’m not readin' that motherfuckin' book, because a human wrote it
I have a fuckin' brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think, to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
'Cause humans be lyin', we're such an inaccurate source
It’s gon’ be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah’s Witness to come on my porch
I swear I’m slammin’ the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I’m not surprised
Humans are fuckin' dumb, still thinkin' that Pac’s alive
I ain’t tryin' to take your legacy and torch it down
I’m just sayin', I ain’t heard shit from the horse’s mouth
Just sheep always tellin' stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I’m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise?
Sounds like a fuckin' Poltergeist!
Show yourself, and then boom, it's done
Every rumor’s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you’re the One
I’ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop on top of a roof to plunge
I’ll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club; instead of bitches, I’d hang with a group of nuns
And everyone I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of you
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven’t been chattin' with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain’t seen no fuckin' talkin' snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don’t know if you do or don’t exist
It's drivin' me crazy, send your condolences
This is me reachin' to you, so don’t forget
If Hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I’ma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feelin' says it’s all fake
I hate to say it, but fuck it, shit, I done lost faith
This isn’t a small phase, my perspective’s all changed
My thoughts just keep pickin' shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you aren’t real, then all my prayers aren’t worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could sit in church and say “fuck” in the services
Man, what if Jesus was a facade?
Then that would mean the government’s God
I feel like they’ve been brainwashin' us with a lot
So much that we don’t even notice that we’re stuck in a box
Man, everything is “what if?” — why is it always “what if?”
Planet Earth “what if?”, the Universe “what if?”
My sacrifice “what if?!”, my afterlife “what if?!”
Every fuckin' thing that deals with you is fuckin' suspect
I’m fuckin' done! I’m fuckin' done!
This is my fuckin' life and I’m livin' it, I’m havin' fun
If you really care for me
Prove that I need to live carefully!
But I’ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside
For an afterlife that isn’t even guaranteed
We are you, and you’re us — stop playin' games!
My life’s all I got, and Heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I'm in Hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as you please, and I’ll just do me
I’m a human, I’ll stay in my lane;

Ill Mind of Hopsin 8,Ill Mind of Hopsin Saga,2016.0,"Nigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
Homie, I made you rich, paid your rent (Damn right!)
Bitin' the hand that was feedin' you
This shit don't make any sense
Nigga, what the fuck? (What the fuck?)
You know this is that real shit
How you gon' forget who built this? (Huh?)
I'm the one who made the company all the millions
Now you got problems to deal with
Man, this is tough luck, see a couple weeks ago we was buds
And the crew that was killin' shit was us
'Til you turned on me, homie, that's fucked up
I ain't keepin' this shit on the hush, hush
On my chest I just carry too much stuff
I done had it, enough is enough, bruh
Plus I needed somethin' to get my buzz up
You done fucked with the wrong dude
Ain't no tellin' what Hopsin is gon' do, creepin' up on you
Quit your sleepin', I told you
This a mothafuckin' journey we finna go through
If I ain't have so much to lose
I swear to God I'd probably beat up and choke you (Damn!)
Nigga, this is that raw shit (Right?)
That organic flow you probably see up in Whole Foods
Shiver me timbers, somethin's fishy 'bout you, Mr. D Ritter
When I told you that I wanted new management
Why the fuck you throw a fit and seem bitter?
Why you catch an attitude whenever I question you
About all my fuckin' percentages?
I know why (Why?), you've been bendin' it
In your benefit—your honor, I'm innocent!
This nigga crazy, I'm tellin' all of my people (You tell 'em!)
He takin' all of my C-Notes (It's true)
See, he has a gamblin' issue
He takes the cash and blows it all at casinos (Damn!)
Uh-oh, when I bring up my royalties
You start avoidin' me, that's some disloyalty
You woke up the evil boy in me, your ass is poisonin
Tell me why you would destroy FV?
This was a fuckin' vision that I had created with your brother
But you too infatuated with the money
You killed it and ran it straight into the gutter
Now I think, ""Why'd I make D—A—M—E the boss?""
You keep pissin' a whole lot of people off
Our whole label came out with a weak result
You on that same bullshit Tomica brought

Nigga, I don't know what you thought
You think I can't see the blood on the walls?
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
I don't know what you thought
I can clearly see the blood on the wall
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit

Hold up! Hold up!
I got some more shit to say, yo

It's supposed to be Funk Volume, isn't it?
Thought it was music above all the business
But you just said: ""Fuck all you niggas!""
You tarnished the brand
And you started a Funk Volume Fitness?
Come on now, really think
Got us portrayin' somethin' we really ain't
How we supposed to be ill
When you on our website with a Shake weight
Tryna be Billy Blanks—nigga, thanks!
Fool, ain't nobody tryna lift weights
We just wanna hit up the studio and just rap and do shows
But you don't understand the culture of hip-hop
You a lame-ass nigga, Dame, half the crew knows
New-Age Jerry Heller, a scary fella
I hate your fuckin' name, every letter
I'm very fed up, you actin' like an ordinary heffa
I'ma take you to the mortuary dress-up
We gave you our trust, then you had us cornered
You got us a shitty label deal with Warner
And if I confront you about it
You tell me I need counsellin' and I got a disorder
You sent me on tour and it's horror
Shitty hotels, no sleep, with no food to order
Meet and greets every single day, it's torture
How you expectin' an A1 performer?
Every time somethin's wrong it's the same thing (What?)
Blah-blah-blah-blah, you just blame me (Damn!)
Then you tell Brooklyn and Jammie (Damn!)
Now they both thinkin' I'm crazy (Damn!)
I deal with this on the daily (Damn!)
My career mentally rapes me (Damn!)
I won't let this nigga break me
He prayin' Dizzy Wright is gon' replace me, shady

What are your fuckin' motives, Dame? Let's talk about it!
Umm, you're our manager, our label-owner, our accountant
Hmm, that's kinda tricky
Somethin is fishy, that's risky
We just don't even know
We go with the flow while you rowin' the boat
You keepin' it simple-minded
'Cause you knowin' our only concern is just hopin' we blow
So, when all the money come in from our album and tours
You sit there and soak in the dough
When did we ever ask about the gross?
When did we ever ask about the net?
You would just hand us money from our shows
'Cause you knew we wasn't questionin' the checks
Nigga, I trusted you with my life
You upped your percentage so I'm makin' less?!
Fuck you, bitch, you get no respect!
This is why Hop is comin' for your neck (Bless!)
All you care about is makin' money
You don't care about a fuckin' soul though
You just fluctuate our dollars up and down
At your convenience like a fuckin' pogo
You been screwin' everybody on the label on the low
And they don't even know though
So, good luck, Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz, I'm goin' solo

Nigga, I don't know what you thought
You think I can't see the blood on the walls?
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
I don't know what you thought
I can clearly see the blood on the wall
Blood on the walls, that ain't goin' down, nigga
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit
Everybody knows you be on it
Ain't got time for your bullshit

Change is one of the most difficult things that we face. But change is inevitable
One reason we don't like change is we get comfortable where we are. We get used to our friends, our job, the place we live. And even if it's not perfect we accept it, because it's familiar. And what happens is, because we're not willing to change, we get stuck in what God used to do, instead of moving forward into what God is about to do
Just because God's blessed you where you are doesn't mean you can just sit back and settle there. You have to stay open to what God is doing now. What worked five years ago may not work today. If you're going to be successful, you have to be willing to change
Every blessing is not supposed to be permanent, every provision is not supposed to last forever. We should constantly evaluate our friendships. Who's speaking into your life? Who are you depending on? Make sure they're not dragging you down, limiting you from blossoming. Everybody is not supposed to be in our life forever
If you don't get rid of the wrong friends, you will never meet the right friends",https://genius.com/Hopsin-ill-mind-of-hopsin-8-lyrics
Ill Mind of Hopsin 4,Ill Mind of Hopsin Saga,2011.0,"Check it, I used to be the goofy man you hounded
The Special Ed kid at lunchtime
The bitches wouldn't stand around with
I would jack off so much back at my parents' house
And now my dick has a permanent imprint
Of my hand around it
Life was lame, I had to pay money to fuck a whore
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug o' war
But then I made enough money for me to fund a tour
Now the ladies show me the goodies under their wonderbra
I'm goin' door to door, with foreign swords
Causin' more than war
Slayin' rappers, commercial or horrorcore
So, hold your head, 'cause I'ma torture yours
Leavin' morbid sores
I promise you it will be hard to ignore the gore
Hip-hop's dead, and I'm the lucky savior
I'm kinda mad and I don't wanna pile up the anger
All these no-flow, gimmicky-ass, fired-up behaviors
With wack beats and gap teeth like Tyler, The Creator
Motherfucker, you not dope
So you tryna get some attention by cussin'
And eatin' a fuckin' cockroach?
In ""Goblin""? You get no props on it
It sucks so much I get blowjobs from it
I been told you niggas, ""I'm real!""
If you wack and no one's confronted you
On your bullshit, then I will
Hate on me, but you can't deny skill
I crush all the momentum that you guys build
With my eyes sealed
You faggots got me cussin'
And only reason you probably buzzin'
Is 'cause you slave as an Illuminati puppet
Y'all really on one, beat it, you're gone, done
You think real niggas feelin' your shit? C'mon, son!
I'm the illest and that's fo' shizzle
My flow sizzles, your boy Hop go hard like some cold nipples
You niggas are makin' it so simple
My swag makes the ladies wave
Like fat stomachs with bold ripples
I know you niggas wish you could prevent it, 'cause I get buck like my Kool Aid's got way too much sugar in it
You better run like I'm booger-flickin'
Homie, I've been good at rappin'
Now I'm tryin' to get gooder with it
So I'ma just go beast, and bring that West Coast heat
'Cause I'll be damned if you flex on me
The radio is filled with garbage over techno beats
And all these songs about cash are what we just don't need
Yo, nobody care about how much money you stack
I murder everything I touch, buddy, move back!
Got enough guts to sew trash and bust up your fluke act
And leave your fans sayin', ""How the fuck does he do that?""
My rankin' is vicious, you thinkin' it isn't?
Come pay me a visit if you feel that you may be offended
Baby, I'm wicked, crazy and sick
And with the face of a nimwit
I be callin' out names, but I ain't takin' attendance
Some bitch was like…

""Hop, you got me cryin'
'Cause you said I could call you
While you out on tour, shit, and I be tryin'
I even text you, but you not replyin'
So when your new shit finally drop
That's one album I will not be buyin'
What, you're too Hollywood?
And you don't even have two minutes?
Ever since you got your buzz
You don't know how bad you trippin'
You went to that ho's house last night
And you said that you didn't
I seen your pic on Facebook
The skank bitch done tagged you in it!""

I got put on with the beastie flow
Now the sluts, they wanna bone when they see me, whoa!
So I must, I take 'em home, let the wee wee grow
Then I bust from different strokes, like the TV show
See, when I be comin' through
Kickin' it raw, niggas like, ""Gee, he's dope!""
If there's anyone throwing dirt at my name
Then you know he be toast
For all of you rappers who bringin' me drama
Homie, please be ghost
The only reason I'm bein' aggressive is 'cause we need hope

""Hey yo, Hopsin, I fuckin' love you
'Cause you supply the best rhymes
Since your flow is kinda strange
You should sign with Tech N9ne
You design erect lines, who am I to just lie?
Every single night I play your music right at bedtime
And usually I'm not into dark dick
I wanna do somethin' freaky enough to win your heart with""
I say, ""What you wanna do?"", she say, ""It's simple, Marcus
I wanna blow it before you put it in like a Nintendo cartridge""

Bitch, I'm hotter than a UV ray
Hotter than the thought of Nicki Minaj naked
Makin' her booty shake
Hot enough to pull up to yo' show and steal yo' groupie date
Hot enough to melt the ice cream that's on Gucci's face
And now you havin' hot flashes
All the shit that you ever wanted in one MC, Hop has it
Don't rap if you do not practice
I cockblock wack shit, now get ready for Knock Madness!",https://genius.com/Hopsin-ill-mind-of-hopsin-4-lyrics

Hollywood-ass rappers, bitch-ass females!

I erupt like a bomb, 
so give up the baton
I'll slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
Why you muggin' me like somethin' was wrong?
Just take a puff of the bong
And let me leave your mind corrupt from the song
See, you can't stop me, 'cause I'ma brainwash teens
And create false dreams, 'cause it pays﻿ off clean
I'm just an idiotic, ironic, symbolic, Illuminatic product
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it (Shhh!)
This industry bidness is all screwed up
I have no favorite rappers, because all you suck
I sever the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
'Cause on a tombstone is as hard as their name will ever be
I'm judged by my wild image a lot
And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot
I do! Be offended by every sentence I jot
I got some militant thoughts
And you ain't killin' 'em off, so listen!

I sag my pants until my ass shows

Yeah I said ""Fuck you!"" — yeah, yeah

I snuck in Drake's house when he was alone inside
You can say I have a bogus mind
I dimmed the lights down and closed the blinds
Around his neck is where my rope was tied
I yanked on it 'til it broke his spine

Lately I been fuckin' pissed off (Why?)
'Cause everybody's sayin' Lil Wayne spits raw
I'll start a big brawl, and slam his ass into a brick wall
And have a fat nigga sit on him, Rick Ross (Boss!)
I don't play with this rap shit
I got no life, I stay in the attic
Fuck a rap career, I'm waitin' to smash it
Soulja Boy, you﻿ got a corny flow

That's wacker than the 
500 dollars
 you signed me for
Eazy's dead now, yeah the label's finally yours
Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore
You can't maintain what Eric built (Nah!)
I know he's in his grave, turnin' like a ferris wheel (Ha!)
Don't think you cool just 'cause you inherit mills (Shit)
Bitch, bare the skills! I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real
I got some deep, dark issues within
All because you lied and tried to pretend you a friend
Fuck Ruthless! Bitch, I'll never lend you a hand!

Nocturnal Rainbows,Raw,2010.0,"You think you're original? You ain't original
You were programmed to be you
You're a slave, and you don't even know it
The shit you think of, ain't even your thoughts
Let's step out the box for a minute!

How do we know if God exists? How do we know it's positive?
Are you the definition of an angel or the opposite?
If you lost your wallet and I found it, I would not commit to stealin' it
But if the tables turned, then you would pocket it
See, I been me for so long, but I still don't know who Hopsin is
How come I'm the one my teachers used to have a problem with?
I show my music to different labels, they ain't too fond of it
But in the underground I seem to get so many compliments
Say my name and it's like people get afraid and shook
But if you take a look, you'll see I'm nothin' like an angry crook
I'm learnin' hands-on, you busy with your face in books
I'm here to benefit the world, so Heaven's where we're safely put
I'm not a devil, not speakin' in tongues
I just wanna touch your heart, I try to reach it in songs
I'm from where a child's future's on the streets with the bums
Because it's hard to become somethin' so unique where I'm from

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power, then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Obama's president, so? What's he represent?
Just because the nigga's half black don't mean he's Heaven-sent
You're clueless to evidence and all the minds he's messin' with
His charmin' smile hasn't got my ass up out this debt for shit
Frontin' like he's truly Jesus,
 and all you fools believe it
The change he's makin' isn't good, that's just how you conceived it
It's like we're all broker than ever, it's due to reasons
Dealin' with self-beneficial plans and the movement he's with
Illuminati,
 
or whatever the fuck they go by
They're the reason weird shit happens and we don't know why
Why did Michael Jackson start his tour, then have to go die?
How did rap music go from really good to so dry?
Real artists get shelved and wack ones get famous
To leave masses brainless, a smart mind is dangerous
In their eyes;
 there probably ain't no real shit in your playlist
You're just a product of what the government has created

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

Yo, we're all smart, and we know what's bad and good for us
But yet, when you got offered some marijuana, you took a puff
Your brain's a fuckin' powerhouse, but what, that wasn't good enough?
It's people like you who talk that ""shoulda, coulda, woulda"" stuff
You probably threw your life away ‘cause you would rather get high
With no license or car, so you bum rides to get by
Sayin', ""I should've did this"" or ""I shouldn't have hung with this guy.""
""I'm broke as fuck, my rent's high. Ah, I should've realized.""
I ain't bein' cruel with these situations that I address
I more than likely could be someone you admire, yes
But it's because the blood, sweat and all the time that I invest
We play the same game, difference is you never try your best
You don't have a skill, you set yourself up for a higher mess
I work around the clock, you slack off for lots of time to rest
Keep bullshittin' till your life is gone
‘Cause livin's naturally hell, you have to work to put a smile on

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see
But the darkness provides the light for me
I don't wanna be lonely
And the moon is my only homie
If there's a higher power then show me
Instead of nocturnal rainbows

When the sun's down
Nocturnal rainbows soar in the air so high
It may seem so that I can't see

I don't wanna be lonely

Hop Is Back,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)

Yeah! The Dark Knight's in this bitch
Without the mask and cape, I'm actin' ape shit
Faggot, embrace it, I just got validation
On my ass-whoopin' ticket; I'm that amazin'
It's my mad invasion of smashin' brains in
My fuckin' pen and pad was anxious
All these haters who mad and be naggin' at me
I flip they ass off like an acrobat on a trapeze
And I'll be lashin' back like a Shaq attack on these rap beats
You thought that I was done
With completely bein' an ass? Please!
Don't think you raw just 'cause you got success
I'll uppercut your ass so many times
You look like you was noddin' yes
I'm the only child that my mom regrets
Probly best that you don't buy my album
Save your money, yo, do not invest

Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)

I consider my flow a malignant rifle
And strip survival, and have you screamin'
Like R&B singers who hittin' high notes
It’s sick and spiteful, 2Pac’s twisted grim disciple
I been this nice, yo, way before Michael had vitiligo
My ex girl's heart is so bruised and burned
Beggin' me to quit rap
But I'm just not ready to let it loose for her
Am I Hopsin or am I Lucifer?
I didn't blow 'til I started talkin' a gang of shit
Tell me who you prefer
Nigga, you ain't ill in the booth
I'd die and do my next show as a hologram
And still be realer than you
See, I'm the shit, like I slithered in poo
I'm sicker than stickin' my freakin' dick
Inside a bitch's syphilis cooch; it's Knock Madness

Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!

You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)

I got a problem, yo, I was ecstatic to buy Yeezus
But I burned it first, heard it, and snapped it in five pieces
Man, Kanye on that bullshit
That’s why the paparazzi made that nigga hit his fuckin' head, that’s what that fool get
You think you God now
You half-assin' rap little faggot bitch?
Perhaps you suffered brain damage
Back when you had that accident
But most importantly, hip-hop isn’t dead no more, you see
'Cause Kendrick took the bar
And then raised it up higher for MC's
Unfortunately the little nigga's like 4 feet 3
The guy's a fuckin' midget, his high is still really short to me
Fuck givin' my pencil breaks
My mental state tells me to renovate
If you hand me your shit, I'll toss your demo tape
“Hop, if you're not spreading love
Then why do you even write music?""
'Cause this is how I feel
When I ain’t rappin' on the mic, you bitch!
Am I supposed to coat it up? Am I not allowed to open up?
I spill the blood of rappers
And use Weezy dreads to soak it up
Bustin' like South Central driveby's
Support the guy with white eyes
But nigga, don’t ride my dick when I’m on that high rise

Your bullshit, come off of that
Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!
I got my du-rag on with my fitted sittin’ on it
Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga

Ill Mind 6: Old Friend,Knock Madness,2013.0,"I remember the first time you overdosed
A fuckin' overload on meth
Paramedics saved your ass, you was close to ghost
You never did know which road to go
It’s like you rode the boat
And sailed away and hoped to hit the golden coast
But you sank like the Titanic
The incident, it left your life damaged
And that’s when I panicked
You thought you had it locked
Well, you ain’t on the right planet
If you're tryin' to live your life right, plan it
It’s like your mind vanished, you don’t even know that
I wish that we could go back
'Cause it’s so sad when I tell jokes and you don’t laugh
Like you used to, I really hate to stress it
But you strange to mess with, so I keep my distance
'Cause you always got this blank expression
Like you’re confused and unaware of yo' surroundings
Emotions have gone and no one’s found it
It’s overwhelmin', your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong

I should've stopped you when I had the chance to do so
But back then I had felt like that was too bold
You started hangin' with new folks
And made the drug environment yo' new home
This world is too cold
Could I have prevented this? Who knows?
They convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do
Sayin' it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible
So you started skippin' school
Hangin' with these wicked dudes
Unaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool
And it’s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?
In they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house
Back when you met 'em I had doubts
They put you on the bad route, and when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out
They fuckin' got you, I can’t lie, but now your brain's fried
You don’t even act like you’re the same guy
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain’t listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong

I ain’t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore
I reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64
And that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards
And we was doin' ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor
Shit changed and it happened quick, but I can’t forget
That you was the first homie I started rappin' with
You could’ve had half of this back when I had established it
But now I have to sit and feel bad
Look at what your actions did!
Man, you were so outgoin' and so hysterical
Seein' you now is just unbearable, it’s terrible
You should've made your choices wisely
Fuckin' with poison ivy; without your brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?
It’s a struggle to get your ass to listen
Really hurt me and the rest of your family
With all your bad decisions
We always told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong

Excuse me, do you need a ride?
Looks like you’re goin' downtown
Yes, hop in my ride!
Well, hi, I’m Chris Dolmeth
I’m your best friend (Chris Dolmeth)
I’m all you need (Chris Dolmeth)
If you wanna succeed, hop in my ride

FLY,Pound Syndrome,2015.0,"I was taught that education is the only way to make it
Then how'd I get so much money inside my savings?
My teachers never saw the heights that I was fuckin' aimin'
Did the man who invented college go to college? Hm, okay then
Am I the only one that noticed humans on the same shit?
Y'all thoughts are sailin' on the same ship
And if that's the case, then that's the reason that you ain't shit
Let me enlighten you, my niggas, just let your brain drift

First of all, the best type of marketin'
Is marketin' that doesn't feel like marketin'
It makes the people feel like they a part of it
And when it's done right, corporations think it's marvelous
They feed us these ideas and then we place 'em in our hearts to sit
It's why players are good at gettin' chicks
It's why Nike is good at sellin' kicks
It's why Disney is loved by all the kids
Why McDonald's owners are super rich
We're too blinded to ever see 'em pitch
See, when this happens we take our health
Wealth, lives, and just hand them off
Thinkin' that we did this from organic thoughts
I know you seen parents trick kids
With candy, toys and Santa Claus
The same method is used to trap adults
But instead of candy it's with money, religion, drugs and alcohol
Mention that shit and it's gon' arouse us all
I done seen niggas get into fights
Over cigarettes like a pack of dogs
They get you hooked and then they laugh at y'all

I really hate to break it to you
But your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world
'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly!

Man, can't you see we're robots
Who know not what we do and we got no shot
In the real world until we climb out of this ice-cold box
Your whole life has been part of a whole plot
To keep you at the bottom while they on top
Stay quiet, then they won't stop
They always tryna show us what we don't got
They do it to all of us 'til we finally break and go cop a gold watch
Knowin' we need the cash for rent, my ass is sick
Just thinkin' about how rich and powerful all these bastards get
They package ideas like it's oxygen
They make us feel like if we ain't got it we're fucked and we cannot fit in
This fuckin' system is not your friend
And understand they controllin' your thoughts 'cause they got a lot to win
Niggas get turned away when I mention this
Ignorance is bliss, but I don't give a fuck,
 
I won't censor shit
The Matrix is real and you done entered it
It's way too intricate for you to ever realize it you fuckin' simpleton

I really hate to break it to you
But your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world
'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly!

Yo, fuck Hollywood! Fuck all these reality shows!
Makin' us feel lame unless we blowin' stacks on new clothes
Makin' us feel like we ain't cool unless we have a few hoes
Makin' us feel like we ugly unless we have a new nose
I see naturally beautiful women get Botox, fake tits
Fake lips, they so brainwashed and it doesn't make sense
Focus on your life and the path you're pursuin'
'Cause y'all too busy worried 'bout what Kim Kardashian's doin'
Check it, most of this shit that you sheep are watchin' on television
Is fake as fuck and is not real,
 
I rebel against it
It's the Devil's business,
 
they just reel y'all in
If they say it we do it, yo I'm tryna tell y'all, man
The system created the stereotype for the Black image
That's why my people are scared to be different
Why don't you get it?
 
I'm done practicin' these ridiculous rituals
It's time I become a real individual and just do me

I really hate to break it to you
But your life's being played with
You have not witnessed the world
'Cause you're stuck in the Matrix
Everything we have been taught was all a lie
Open your eyes, open your mind, and fly!

Use your mind, be yourself
Don't blame nobody else but you
You and the meaning of life
Has no rules, no rules, no rules
Fly away! Fly away! Away, away, away!
Life's too short not to live it
The world is all yours, come get it
Just go and get it, it's beautiful",https://genius.com/Hopsin-fly-lyrics
Ill Mind of Hopsin 9,No Shame,2017.0,"Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
All together, come on!

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma (hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

Oh, hello son, I really wish I knew you
I'm your father you'll probably never be introduced to
You'll only see me on TV or maybe YouTube
But now I know your momma is probably dating some new dude
So how you liking Earth? Are you loving your existence?
I wasn't at your birth, 'cause your mother made me miss it
I tried to get a visa, I applied and they denied it
'Cause your momma told the police that I beat her, she was lyin'
And now I'm banned for something bad that I ain't even do
There's a lot of land and water separating me and you
You're far away in Australia and I am in America
So I cannot be there to do all of the things a parent does
This is my attempt at me raisin' you from a distance
You have Hopson in your blood, you are special and you are gifted
The punishment your mother has given me doesn't seem fair
Just know I love you, son, and I'm wishin' that I could be there

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (it's sad)
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Now sing it with me, son!

But Momma had to fuck it all up (yeah, that's it)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(That's why what?) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

I know you and your momma stayin' with her parents Bill & Kirsten
You're partially black, I'm confident they're feelin' nervous
They don't like colored people, in their eyes you're still a burden
They assume you gonna grow up shootin' guns and stealin' purses
But that's not true, son, don't be sad
I know you're not like that, you know I got your back
Listen, here's a funny joke that you could tell your grandmother
She looks like the Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters
Oh, I forgot, you're too young to know what that is
But that's the kinda thing I like to say to plumpy fat chicks
The humps on Mom's chest, they're not real, they're elastic
And if you look closely, you can see she's made of plastic
Like a toy, you my boy, my son, my friend
I promise we gon' be together somehow in the end
I am very ashamed that you don't have my last name
Every night I go to bed and I'm feelin' this wicked pain, because—

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma

But Momma had to fuck it all up (that's right)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma
(Daddy doesn't fuck with who?) (Hell no)
No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

Currently my life has hit the floor
I can't lie to you, shit is hard
I should be buildin' with the Lord
It could be what I'm missin' or
Maybe I should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more
Just to relieve the tension that sits in my heart, 'cause it is sore
When I'm spittin' bars about all my cash and exquisite cars
This was on my vision and you were the one I did it for
My relationship with your momma is sittin' in the morgue
After all this hell, I can't lie, I do wish she did abort
Our lives are so unhappy
'Cause this world is cold and nasty
Just know your daddy don't condone havin' a broken family
I'm so sad we couldn't work out our issues 'fore you arrived
And now you have to suffer
'Cause Mom and Daddy have stupid lives
You're way too young to notice it
You don't deserve to go through this
If I do see your mom again, this time I will assault the bitch
At least then I'll feel like my banning was justified
Look at your momma, thank her for fuckin' up all our lives, and sing

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up
And now your daddy doesn't fuck with your momma (hell no)
Nope, Daddy doesn't fuck with your momma
Where's my choir at?

Our lives coulda been so good
But Momma had to fuck it all up (Momma had to fuck it all up)
And that's why Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

No, Daddy doesn't fuck with my momma

Oh, son
I'm sorry I can't be there with you
But I'll be there soon

I'm back, nigga, wassup? ""Hop, how'd you get your buzz up?
I heard you signed over your soul to the Devil, is it true?"" Nigga, shut the fuck up!
In my heart there ain't much love, so if you get bashed then that's tough luck

Yeah, I'm back up in this, I'm a real nice nigga, but I rap with vengeance
Only got bad intentions and I'm lookin' for a new mouth that my nutsack could fit in
I look like an idiot to grab attention, but my new fans tellin' me to trash my lenses
It's bad for business, I'm lackin' senses, feels like I'm trapped in a black dimension
Stepped in this bitch to wreck so don't disrespect, I promise that it'd be a big regret
I'll twist ya neck, I'm lookin' for a fish to catch, I chop niggas up, yeah, I learned it from Tech
I got hoes all over that wanna give me (Dome), they all yellin', ""Hopsin, you turn me (On)""

You feel what I'm sayin'? (Uh?) Shit, neither do I (Nah)
I'ma give you niggas one more album and after that it's peace out and I'm leavin' you guys, you know why?

Holler at cha' boy if you know somebody!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Hopson is doomed, locked in a room, spaced out like a little pop in the shrooms
God lit a fuse, now I gotta make a decision and I don't really know which Hopsin to choose
I'm a big wreck, did you not get the news? I made a million bucks but did not get amused
How did I manage to get robbed from the truth? Maybe I should'a never went and dropped outta school
""It's not that bad, you're okay, kid, cheer up!"" But I got a life that I ain't too sure of (Yup)
Swagger lookin' just like Ace Ventura, can't look at myself, I might break this mirror
(Shit! Fuck! Fuck!) I'm paranoid, I panic over every little scary noise
See, when I go pick up the phone and tell friends about it they won't answer, 'cause they're annoyed
I'm like ugh, I put a porno on, 'cause my life ain't awesome, man (Yeah, yeah)
Jack off, go to sleep, wake up, jack off again (Yeah, yeah)
Then repeat the cycle, can't go to sleep unless I leave the lights on
You don't know how many fuckin' demons I know, maybe I should go and tell 'em read the Bible (Fuck! Oh no!)
I don't even like rap, only thing I wanted was just to be cool (Be cool)
And hang out with a group of friends and solve mysteries like I'm Scooby Doo (-By Doo)
But I got way more than I bargained for, you can't kill when your heart is sore
I'm so mad I could start a war, so fuck Hopsin! Man, I don't even know who I are no more

That there changed my whole entire life, you make more tings like that? I'll buy!""
Well, I got news for you, my screws are loose (I'll tell ya)
This rap thing here's what I used to do, now I'm movin' to (Australia)
When I go ghost I'ma get a house on the Gold Coast, yellin' YOLO on a couch, feelin' so dope
Livin' low pro, so these foul niggas don't know, I'll be struttin' around like (Hell yeah)
Man, I'm losin' my mind, but y'all assume that I'm cool when I rhyme
See, I'm tryin' to be Marcus and Hopsin, but I get depressed when the two intertwine
Truthfully, I'm not the man that I used to be, nobody cared, so I used the beats
To talk to, so I lose the heat, I'm cut bad and the bruise is deep, is there anything you can do for me?

I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out

Never will the bomb ignite unless you step to me
Gonna be the one inside of my trajectory
Nigga better run and hide, I kill excessively
That’s my recipe, 'til the death of me
You don’t wanna be the reason I'ma lose it
Anybody wanna battle, better cool it
I'ma chop on top and I come cruisin', two-bit
Sloppy chopped and I can prove it, stupid!
I'ma buck ‘em all down
Tecca N9na sick, I’m such a raw clown
Eager to F it up, even if ever ya
Evil, I eat ‘em up, fuckin’ y'all sounds
Smother ya, when I pop at people they discover the
Killer stoppin’ evil, what the fuck is ya
Trippin off of? You can get lickin' my governor
Nigga, they callin' me Bane, like Saddam Hussein
Ain't that a bitch? 'Cause me and Hop only thing
Is takin' over like Pinky and the Brain
I'ma give you the gun and
You’re never livin' when the trigger is summoned
I see you sucka shakin', shiver, you runnin'
""The niggas are comin'! The niggas are comin'!""
Better tell them all that they don’t want the N9na hail to fall
Your lowlife, soon they’re gonna be no life, doomed
Gonna go night, dunes, gonna pick yo' right tomb
I know it’s irkin' you niggas
You watchin' me rip it then blow like boom!

We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it

Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
You damn right
Nigga, I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out
Day and night
I'll rip your mothafuckin' heart out

Let me get the baton back, I’ma bomb rap
Lookin' oh so malicious with contacts
Nigga starin', like, ""Damn, where yo' mind at?!""
This ain’t no pro level shit, it’s beyond that
Loaded up and I’m ready for combat
Standin' out like I’m Khalifa's blonde patch
When I come at you with vicious artillery
You wouldn’t want it, like Tomica’s contract
I K.O. niggas, I'm sorry
Then I throw 'em in a white trash RV
Then they wake up with a blade stuck in their rib
Yelling: ""Oh my goodness, yo, where are we?!
Hopsin, this shit is too gnarly!
Why would you wanna go harm me?
I thought we was homies
Now you wanna go and turn me into shrimp on the barbie!""
(Fatality)
 Bitches, I am rap, every verse is fire
I lay my shit down like fertilizer
A murderous words supplier, merkin' you is my first desire
If you got a problem with me
You can suck on my dick 'til it squirts saliva
The whole planet been waitin' to get a serial killer symphony
Comin' from the Volume and Strange
Get in the way of a killer, try to deliver
You gonna end up in a trap, and I’m sewin' your brains
MC's wanna take the bar down
I fucked the game and even picked your card out
Bitch, I'm far out
Hopsin and Tecca N9na takin' over,
 we gon' rip your heart out

We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it
We the coldest, flow hypnosis
So explosive, yo' bitch knows it

Ill Mind of Hopsin 3,Ill Mind of Hopsin Saga,2009,"They tell me that my vibe is too dark, my eyes are too harsh
That's all I ever hear when I rhyme a few bars
I kinda live a rapper's life, shit, minus two cars
And free girls to fuck
'Cause where I'm from the hynas do charge
My label hyped me up
And told me I had about twelve hits—they lied
'Cause when my fuckin' album dropped, I didn't sell shit
Well, bitch, you tried to fuck my life up? You nailed it!
'Cause you didn't promote my record
And I don't know who the hell did
You shoulda hired Tanner Guinn, yup, Hop is mad again
Just enough to leave your little skull frame hammered in
See, this is what happens when I take that little magic pen
And get to scribblin' psychotic lines worth some damagin'
I hate to tell you, but you are crazy
You were born as a retard baby
And when I come around, you start shaking
'Cause you're a bitch who dates hard ladies
With big beards who say, ""Arr, matey!""
Yo, Pillow Man the alias Hopsin has been the signature
I'm far from similar to you niggas whose flow is minature
You'll be diminished for crossin' limits on my perimeter
I'm not a gimmick, I'm a committed, demented, sinister
It's Funk Volume, now what?
If you thinkin' that rap's officially dead, you haven't found us
We built the movement from the ground up, your sound sucks
Until now we let you slide, but you're now fucked
It's just reality, you posers done been wack
I hold it down like my boner in gym class
And fuck Wayne! Man, I'm doper than his ass
Him, Nicki, and Drake can get thrown over a cliff fast
You got cash? Big whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo!
If I had a knife right now, it would be stuck in you
Yo, you ain't gonna like this corner that you pushed me up into
'Cause all you rap about's how you beat the pussy up and ooze
Fuck your fast car, your cheap singin'
You keep sayin' the same shit, while T-Painin'
And we bangin' simply because it's all we hear
Man, look at all these queers
The shit is so watered-down I developed soggy ears
Kill me! Shit, I'm waitin' to die, bitches
I hate on all you rappers who made it, 'cause I didn't
And I admit it, man, I ain't gon' bullshit y'all
As long as you walkin' away sayin' that fool spits raw
Yo, I'm from the West, I throw up the W and I stay hot
But still ain't mentioned
With Nipsey Hu$$le, Glasses, or Jay Rock
What I gotta do, dig 'Pac up out of his grave spot
And wear his face as a mask to my next show to create props?
People always ask why do I sound mad
'Cause I ain't got a girlfriend with a round ass
And all my fuckin' dinners come in a brown bag
How sad! I need a crossroad to get found at
Most rappers be in a six-four
I prefer a big horse, lit torch, and a pitchfork
While you out late workin' your shift when the kids snore
I'm fuckin' your wife while the bitch snorts
Wearin' swim shorts
I got a message on Facebook from some lame guy
And he was like, ""Hopsin, dude! I fucking HATE life!
I wanna rap, but I have stage fright, and I can barely write
And I never make music that the babes like!
And when I come home from school, I wait 'til late night
And bump your music really super-loud
And paint my face white
For real, bro, if you just help me, dude
I swear to God, I'll do anything you tell me to!""
Whoa, don't hit me up tryna suck my dick!
'Cause I'm a guy, and I would rather fuck five chicks
With some plump nice tits and the butt size thick
So I can hit the G-spot that only tough guys hit
So if you hear a rumor that I rape mics, it's true
When I drop 
RAW
,
 that will be the day I get sued
Damon Elliot, I might as well just say bye to you
Fuck the industry!

Haywire

Off the chain with a brand new delivery (yeah)
Try to get in my way, the feelin' of rage

Fuckin' maniac purgin', a rap server
The cat burglar who be committin' mass murder

I just don't have enough patience to take it out

All Your Fault,UnKnown,2017.0,"I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', it's all your fault

Mo' money, mo' problems it is
Now I'm back to writin' my lyrical novel again
I'm holdin' on grenades and I'm tryin' to not pull a pin
I done contemplated on downin' a bottle of gin
'Cause maybe that'll calm my nerves and get my ass on track
I'm on the fuckin' edge, I snapped and I just can't go back
I have no class, I'm cut from how my last ho act
She tried to ruin me, she damn near made my cash flow crash
I fuckin' hate this bitch, her name could sit on a grave
Only reason she ain't dead is 'cause my kid on the way
The bitch is pregnant and she strippin', dodgin' minimum wage
She done kicked me down, locked me up and spit on my face
I bought a ring for this bitch just to set it in stone
My headache has grown, damn I shoulda left it alone
Now heaven is gone, so is my love and it won't return
Welcome to hell, bitch, I hope you burn, because—

I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', 
it's all your fault

Listen, lil' nigga, we ain't in the same shoes
You ain't built a name or even paid dues
Damn it, I'm ashamed of what it came to
And if you had've ever reached my level of fame guaranteed Dame would have played you
He's in the wrong, don't give me hate for it
You know him better than me
Y'all always had a broken relationship
Now you lookin' at me like I'm Satan's spawn
But five years ago you had made the same diss song
Why don't you put it out?
Show the world you hate your brother too
Don't be afraid to show the truth
Shit, you ain't got much to lose
Anyone can hold a gun up, but who's brave enough to shoot?
You know damn well he's addicted to rakin' up the loot
If you seen the shit I seen, you woulda taken sides with me
But you fuckin' disappeared and you ain't even ride with me
And now you wanna return when the label hit the bottom
Nigga, fuck you and your phoney mental problems!

I'm so tired
Of all the problems you've been causin' me
We are not cool no mo' as far as I can see
You kicked me down, I've fallen
I'm crawlin', it's all your fault

Too many motherfuckers judge my life
And make me out to be a monster like I love my strife
Too many motherfuckers pick at what the fuck I write
They hate to see me shine, they wish they could cut my light
I use my music as my public diary, it's what inspires me
It's why your fuckin' son admires me, come and fire me
Settle with the hell that I was put in, nuh-uh
You motherfuckers keep forgettin' I'm too good at my job
Y'all shoulda knew this, some think I'm too retarded and stupid
Overnight I just went and started a movement
The power at my fingertips is greater than Funk Volume and Ruthless
Ha ha, you still losin', you niggas thought you could do it
Go crawl in some sewage, you niggas ain't no entrepreneurs
You fucked with Hopsin Da Ruler and now I'm hollerin' screw ya
Hallelujah, all the deadweight is finally cut off
Niggas, the throne is mine, so stay the fuck off!

Crown Me,Pound Syndrome,2015.0,"Yo, let me take you to the tribe real quick

I'm from that small city called Panorama
Where the vatos roam and they blast they hammers
Never had no sense, so I'm bad with manners
Who'd've thought I'd be livin' life in the flashin' cameras?
Got bitches on my nuts like pubics (Ooh!)
Niggas could never figure me out like Rubik's (Cubes)
I be bullyin' everybody like I'm Brutus! (Who?)
So don't underestimate me, I do this, truest
I'm calm and ill but still drop bombs, I kill
You know the deal, with my godly skills
You wanna jog the field in my shoes? There's a lot to fill
It won't happen, you cannot be real
Man, there's so many rappers that wanna catch my fade
So many bitches that wanna snatch my brain
I'll probably end up on the news, dead, bullet in the head
Mama in the street yellin': ""That's my baby!""
You want me to keep it to a minimal with the syllables?
I think you should get up off my genitals
Every nigga identical when they spit a flow, this shit is critical
I'ma have to get rough and get all my sentinels
Nigga, what you be sippin' on? I'm guessin' your pen is broke
Is it difficult for you to get better? You're so despicable
'Cause your shit is boo-boo, your bars are predictable
I do not bump it, it's hard to get into you
Please admit it, man, the voyage is radical
Mind is set to just destroy, I'm an animal
Killin' shit, man, I'm a poisonous antidote
I be on it, man, your boy's international
Yeah, I'm mad with rhymes
Been doin' this since '99, I'm a mastermind
Homie, it's 2015, and all my niggas gon' kill it
When they finish the job, the other half is mine

Fool, you ain't on that real shit
I live here, you on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick
It's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a little bit
I serve you, you get the bill quick
Crown me, I'm a real prince

Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (Give it!)
I said ""Give me that shit!""
Give me that crown boy! (C'mon!)
Give me that shit!

The rap game's mine, I revolve it 'round me
I think I have lost it, and my mind's exhausted
I'm nauseous from the process
Of hoppin' on stage and tryin' to dive in moshpits
Nigga, why you focused on diamonds?
These Cubic Zirconia's all up in my ear
Over jewelry, I don't get excited
My perception in life is ""Why the fuck am I here, nigga?""
I've been this way since your ass has been suckin' on titties
Since niggas cocked back and start bustin' on 50
Since J-Lo was mobbin' in public with Diddy
Since Biggie and Pac got shot up, it's a pity
That bullshit you're talkin', I'm not in the mood, bro
Continue yappin', you'll see Hopsin is brutal
Keep pushin' me, you gon' get dropped with some Judo
You fannin' out like you want cock in yo' culo
Niggas only in it for money and bitches
I don't even think they wanna rap no more
But they wanna be all over the television
Rockin' feminine shit, tryin' to act homo
Old bi-ass niggas can't bypass niggas
""I can't change even if I tried""-ass niggas
Tight jeans on so they show yo' ass-ass niggas
In the pool with the homie, tryin' to splash-ass niggas
Fruity as Mike and Ike, you'll get diced to rice
When I arrive I pull up like ""Hi! Surprise!""
It might be wise to hide when the nightly skies are high
Fuckin' with an ape; no Life of Pi
Tell me, what position would the game be in
Without me havin' the ability to rape the pen?
Pound Syndrome, this is it, I'm weighin' in
I still hate y'all niggas and I can't pretend

Fool, you ain't on that real shit
I live here, you on a field trip
I'm made of shit you ain't built with
You a bitch, yo' girl need a real dick
It's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
You don't scare niggas, not even a little bit

Ill Mind of Hopsin,Ill Mind of Hopsin Saga,2009.0,"Who am I? Why am I even here, man?
Okay, let's take a trip through my mind and see what we find. Yeah. Okay. Yo.

In high school, Marcus wasn't a helpful student
He dropped out 'cause teachers would never help him through it
And if I don't save this rap game who else would do it?
This is my motherfucking world, welcome to it
If you thinking that Hop's whack, then you is hating
And what the fuck do my contacts have to do with Satan?
I want a bitch with a bomb ass and some lubrication
A loverboy, you see I'm that but I'm rude and blatant
Now you listen here: I started a movement this year
I will fuck you up if you interfere
You been a queer your whole fucking life and I'll kick you into gear
You trying to prove you a lunatic? Ooh, I'm oozing in fear!
You on some sloppy-clown bitch shit: I'll rip your head off
Poke a stick through it, then beat the rest of your body down with it
I start violence, cops come with the loud sirens
Now I have to hop a barbed-wire fence
They find me in the broke down car I had been hiding in
Homicide is now the charge I'm against
Walk up to the jail cell with the guard I am with
He pushes me in and then the bar slides in
This new age of rappers, all they wanna do is floss, why?
Swearing they're the boss guy, thinking that they're all fly
You, Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy, this Asher Roth guy
Normally I would mind, but this time I've lost mine
Who the hell is he? The biggest hater that you'll ever meet
White contacts, so you motherfuckers remember me
Lyrics put together so cleverly, you will never be
On my level, I chop all of you rappers to celery
Fake thugs rap like: ""I'll let the Glock spit at you
Just got out the pen 'cause I move how real niggas move""
No, don't lie, 'cause it hurts when you hear the truth
You got out the pen and wrote a verse with it, didn't you?
Fuck life, you can't tell me nothing
I'll shove a knife in your back and leave it poking out through your belly-button
Sir, your daughter wasn't that reluctant
You see this 8-inch dick bulging out of my pants? Well, she sucked it
I went to Wal-Mart with a Visa card, bought your wife a leotard
And made her try it on to get my penis hard
I'm pissed enough, I can never find a bitch to fuck
I beat my dick a lot, that's why only my right wrist is buff
I go dumb off of two packs of Now and Laters
Then fight niggas like I was the black Power Ranger
Head to the lake then wrestle a couple alligators
Then run through the woods butt-naked; so what, pal? It's nature
Why the fuck would I collab witchu?
Yeah, you're good friends with Marcus but Hopsin don't wanna rap witchu!
You're full of shit like some ass-tissue
And you're a bitch when you go to studios you bring your dad with you
No! Unacceptable, now watch me wreck a flow
Niggas be hating 'cause I'm balling just like my testicles
Word is bond, the way I'm on this mic and serving bombs
I might as well have an Osama bin Laden turban on",https://genius.com/Hopsin-ill-mind-of-hopsin-lyrics
Dream Forever,Knock Madness,2013.0,"You're the only girl who never disrespected me
You always know how to bring out the best in me
Cupid shot us separately
Then we came together, it was destiny
I love you ‘till there ain’t no loving left in me, definitely
Our souls will ride together, even when the stars die
And when parted, my heart cries
It's angels like you, who make it hard why?
It's cause you beautiful, outgoing and smart
And shit you really set the bar high
All you bring to me is happy moments
You make me feel like I'm cute even though my face got all this acne on it
The way I feel for you, you can't revoke it
Cause it changed me, and my family knows it
Damn, we both just kind of fell into this
You gave me proof that heaven exist
But tell me, what is love without a headache or twist?
You come taunting, every night after twelve when I'm unconscious
You never come out when the sun's watching
Baby, I need you

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you

I wake up in the morning with this sensational pain
It goes straight to the brain then my day is invaded with rain
Engraved in my veins is your name, this ain't gonna change
It is staying remain unless my heart is deflated and drained
Your love is magic
Daydreaming about you is such a habit
Thought I saw you when I was driving
But I was stuck in traffic
If other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken
I tell em' scram
 
cause they need to know I'm happily taken
You see my love life, it wasn't going well till I found you
Fellas get jealous and doubtful when I tell em' about you
I know we had our fair share in the past, with selfish lust
But once we came together we sealed it and nailed it shut
Your touch is that of a goddess
When we kiss, I'm at a lack of words
Especially when we pull away
And then you smile afterwards
In our hearts, we're no different in color
We live for each other, I'm glad you're my significant other
I love you

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you

Baby it saddens me to know that you only exist in dreams
I sit and fiend for you when I'm awake
And it seems like I’ll never be happy unless I sleep
I failed to see the point in living without you
It got me thinking death is sweet
I’ll never know unless I leap, I guess I reach for the stars
Cause girl I'm in love with you oh so desperately
What I'm about to do I kept discrete
I rest the cheek on the pillow as I'm counting sheep
Take me to ecstasy
I tried to get you out my head, the pain's a lot worse
I love you more than anything, I won’t even put God first
You’re the only reason that I sleep so often
I'm hurting nights I don’t see you
I just keep on tossing and turning
I feel so lost and deserted, you made my life good
I told you if I had to take a bullet for you, I would
So baby here I go with the proof, this is it
The moment of truth, only for you *gunshot*

Where are you? Are you only in my dreams?
I don’t wanna wake up
I’ll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I’m really hoping to find you

I don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up I’ll stay asleep
I don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna, don’t wanna wake up

How you like me now?
Yeah, how you like now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
WOW!

Yo! So I'ma flop? Nah, that's where you guys are wrong
I shit on niggas, that's why I rap with a diaper on
Don't be approaching me with none of your mess
Talking 'bout where I belong
Just tell your friends all about me and sit
And watch as they minds get blown
Niggas on that basic shit, now I'ma go ape a bit
I know y'all prayed for this, so don't trip
Here's a handkerchief for your razored wrists
My flow got a few ways to switch
Niggas act hard, I'ma change the script
Everybody begging to be a buddy of mine
'Cause they know I got skills y'all can't prevent
When I lace a hit you impressive, none
You can take it as a lesson, son
If you was smart, you'd drop the mic and
Try to stick up a bank with a weapon drawn
Pillow Man was slept upon
That's the reason the West was gone
But I set the bomb, when it blows up
You niggas will know where the heck I'm from
I'm keeping it raw fo' sho', flow so diabolical
You all should know that it took like 10 whole years
Just for my balls to grow
No overnight success, I'm struggling just to write this mess
The road to righteousness was more than words and skill that I possess

I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like ""Wow!""
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
Ayo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Yo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ayo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
Yeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers (Guess who it is!)
How you like me...

Ayo! S-W-I-Z-Z and add another
My swagger makes your girl want to cut, like upper
I'm mad hot, dog, my 16s should come with mustard
If you think I have a big head, then you haven't see my brother!
Stacked bad niggas swore I wouldn't make it rappin'
Promised it couldn't happen and hated with a passion
A mixtape later I silenced their laughing
Now the same ones would probably suck my dick if I asked 'em
It's obvious I have it locked like CAPS
Rocking to a bitch fight beat that slaps
I do it major, Poly Sci & Bio
I don't have haters only fans in denial
Now gimme a minute to hop in my zone, I'm making 'em pop like Mary
I'm rocking the party to act all retarded, I'm making 'em pop like cherries
I know this nigga is wild, but I will knock him down
Just answer this question for me:
How you like me, how you like me now?

I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like ""Wow!""
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
Ayo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Yo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ayo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
Yeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers
How you like me...

Oh, so you wanna be cool? You wanna be pals?
You wanna be closest friends?
See a nigga so hot, that's why I'm popping up
Like I'm toaster bread
I say shit that don't get said
That's why I can't roll with feds
Illuminati got they eye on me
And they gon' see to it that a nigga don't get fed
My purpose ain't hard to see
I pull up on rappers like ""pardon me
Your bars are weak, you put too much time
Tryna get your sparkling charm to bling""
I be kickin' 'em multiple syllables
Ripping up shows and holding my genitals
Get a dose of the wicked flow before your niggas run up
Saying ""Homie, you should've known""
It's crazy how life can switch
I ain't gonna lie to you mine was shit
Not anymore, shit changed up
From woman selection to size of tits
I know bitches who can ride the dick
Niggas who think that my eyes are sick
Showing 'em many agents who be loving
The melodies that I supply them with
Yo! I gotta a note for all y'all
In the rap game who got an album stacking dough
Y'all got big, chains'll start falling off like Michael Jackson's nose
Who the illest? Y'all know
Hopsin, yeah, bravo
I'm 'bout to leave the building right now
AbadeAbade that's all folks

I was the nigga all you niggas used to clown
Now when I come around, I got you motherfuckers like ""Wow!""
Yeah, how you like me now?
I'm flossin' all you nigga's like BLAOW!
Ayo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Yo! How you like me now, motherfucker?
How you like me..
Ayo! Let me see you clown, motherfuckers
Let me see..
Yeah! How you like me now, motherfuckers
How you like me...

Let me ask you niggas something
How you like me ha?
All you motherfuckers used to hate talk that shit
How you like me?
I know I haven't made a check
But I get more than you bitch-ass
I talkin' on the song like it's my track and shit
Sorry Hop for takin' it over, but I had to
I mean I didn't have to but - holla at me
You know what it is?

Kill Her,Raw,2010.0,"Tell em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

First off I’m a little bit psycho, I know
Dumb like a mentally retarded kid
I ain't got no friends, no ends to my stress
So I chill in the dark and shit
With a rifle and bomb, knife in my palm
Thinking 'bout the motherfucking lives I'mma harm
Swing at me then I'm slicing your arm
Then make you videotape me piping your mom
Ruthless!
Deceitful lies, listen up, you don’t want beef to rise
I really wanna murder Tomica Wright
I’m thinking of taking her out for a pizza slice
Then tie her ass up and then beat the life
Out her god damn skull 'til she bleeds and cries
The whole fucking time she was screaming ""Why?""
Fuck you bitch, don’t be surprised!
Time after time you told me that my album would drop
It was all bullshit, then the day that it finally did
Bitch how come it flopped?
It’s Ruthless baby for sho'
 I’m tryna make me some dough
Get up off your ass to make a motherfucking marketing plan
And then maybe I'll blow
But no!
You wanna be a little bitch about it
Thought that I would never do shit about it
You made a contract with a twist around it
So I could never, ever, ever get up out it
No outlet so I'm pissed about it
I'd be really dumb if I just allowed it
Watch your back, you might get surrounded!
Bang, bang, bang you hit the ground!
Then

ILL!
Tell 'em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through

Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Yeah brother you got to feel it just like a killer, killer!
Kill her, kill her!
Kill her, kill her!

Listen up, don’t you ever hate me
'Cause I’ma blow up like a bomb when I’m detonated
See, you be tripping like a nigga
That's walking with his shoes untied
Best believe I’ma set it straight
Tie a rope around both of your legs, then hook 'em to 2 cars
And drive 'til they separate
Now your soul's in the sky, try to levitate
Bitch you gon' live life in a better place
You done fucked me once, you done fucked me twice!
Having me begging to drop must be nice!
Look at Eazy-E's lovely wife
Maybe the reason is my ugly eyes
I be the illest when I crush these mics
But it never occurred that I must be right
You’re the reason I say ""fuck my life""
I hate you bitch, it's a must we fight!
Everybody keep on running around and asking
What do Tomica be doing with her time
I don’t really know though
I just keep it low-pro, 'cause I'm mad with the contract I signed
I was so happy at first, then it turned to a curse
How'd it happen to me?
That’s the question
I could not get the answer
So now I’m building a casket for  to rest in
Bitch you ain't nothing but a big phony
Lying to niggas, saying you signed with Sony, bitch
None of the staff up there knows me
How come my rap career's moving so slowly, bitch?
Now I got big enough buzz to destroy you and Ruthless
You can’t hold me, bitch!
I’ma fuck around and put some steel toes on
Wanna kick your ass in the ovaries, bitch!

ILL!
Tell 'em all what I came to do
KILL!
One word that explains the truth
REAL!
Bang out 'til your brain is loose
All your little fun filled days are through
Remember that I’m like this thanks to you

And bitch, I made hits, day to day in the basement
Slavin' away, playin' the game, makin' my name fizz
And lowkey I been checkin' to see how Dame is

Just danglin' from a string, I was made to disrupt the peace

Buckle up, nigga! Have a blast, I'm an avalanche

Die This Way,UnKnown,2016.0,"Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised

Hmmm

My vision has always been golden
That's why I see the pearly gates starting to open
I ain't got no friends
Because I've been an omen, oh man
Hmmm, take a look at the enemies blood I am soaked in
Yeah, staring back at my reflection thinkin'
'Bout the hand of cards I've been holdin'
When I'm upset it's hard to control it
Soon as I'm fully charged, I unload it
This shit is keeping Marcus so devoted
To writing these crazy bars and you know it
I'm too steady with the juice
Get the booth ready, when I barge in I'm Hulk'n
I'm no longer with Avengers
Heart is frozen with some vengeance
8 years old, I was a menace
Can't get lost in all the critics
They judging when they ain't crawled up out the trenches
Look bitches, I'm making doe from all the bitchin'
You'd think I whip baking soda in the kitchen
Its U.P and taking over is the mission, the realest
And they should know the shit's encrypted, listen

I debate
Should I smile like everything's good and pretend that life is great
Or should I let the world see the real me and not hide this pain
I tried to be like the rest of y'all, sorry I just can't
I'ma probably die this way (I'ma die this way)

Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way

Where did my mind go?
Tell me why am I letting these bombs blow
I'm stubborn and even my mom knows that
Am I lonely? Yes
I'm on one, that's why my homies left
I live with no regrets, motherfuckers I won't repent
Man, the other day I cussed my girlfriend's parents out
It is apparent now
They tryna justify their daughters bullshit?
Whelp, I am raw enough to air it out
I'm intense at times, in my mind
There's a grinch inside that tells me to write offensive lines
If the shit I do doesn't make sense in your head
Nigga fuck you 'cause it makes sense in mine
Yeah, I think I got a little ego
If you cut me open, you would see I'm full of it
From the 818, a motherfuckin' Panorama City hooligan
I see the whole world and everybody looking like a duplicate (that's true)
Bitch I do me, and that's the only way you'll ever see me doin' it

I debate
Should I smile like everything's good and pretend that life is great
Or should I let the world see the real me and not hide this pain
I tried to be like the rest of y'all, sorry I just can't
I'ma probably die this way (I'ma die this way)

Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way

I don't feel no shame
Why should I hide this pain?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Sorry we're not the same

There isn't much that anybody else can tell me
I'm the only nigga living in my shoes and this shit is overwhelming
I travel earth like a lost soul
Fires burning as I rot slow
There ain't many I can vent to in this world
I got family but we're not close
So I tell my story through a hot song
You all know to get your popcorn
When I hit you with the Ill Mind
Neverland? That's a place you know we're not goin'
This is struggle and pain
About me always being stuck in the rain
To be honest, I don't want it to change
I'ma take it to my death bed up until nothing remains

Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ah yeah, you know I'ma die this way, I'ma die this way

Good Guys Left Behind,Knock Madness,2013.0,"I know I don't usually make love songs, but there's a few
Special girls who kind of changed my perspective on everything
And I feel like every guy comes to that point in his life
Where he changes from a boy into a man
So yo, this one is strictly for the ladies, only

See when I met your stupid ass up at the mall on accident
I thought you was the baddest chick I ever seen but that was so inaccurate
You stole my heart like you had done some magic trick
Your essence was so fabulous you also had a sexy look and rack of tits
I only had intentions to respect your ass and that was it
I took you for a walk under the moon, we joked and laughed a bit
The chemistry was there, right where we met I had to act on it
At that moment I knew you was the girlfriend that I had to get
What happened bitch? 
I swear you had me mad sprung
Our first time hanging I could've did more than I had done
But I didn't because I was nervous, in my heart, you had reserved a place
So sexing you just wasn't on my mind cause you were worth the wait
Shit got to a point where you started cancelling dates we made
Gave me crazy rage, you had me thinking you hate me, great
You vanished with no signs and I didn't even know why
'Til I found out you had a fucking boyfriend this whole time

Why couldn't you just tell me?
You had me buying plane tickets to go see your stupid ass
Then you cancelled on me at the last minute talking about you busy
Bitch, I'm busier than you and I still make time for your bitch ass
Fuck you!

I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now
Baby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you
Cause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys
And good guys get left behind

I swear I'm sick of this, bein' stuck in predicaments
Gettin' the shitty end of the stick and it's never different
Hours spent on the phone as I'm listenin' to your gibberish
Blah-blah-blah your mind was scrambled I tried to configure it
I'm not one you should move past, these player guys, you choose that
To me, you're worth a lot more than what they had valued you as
Only reason they hollered was because you got a cute ass
They just want you for sex and then they move on to a new task
Your actions show your true class, I think you're moving too fast
Datin' these strangers can be dangerous, they rarely do last
But you just too blinded to see, just like a disease
The guy that you been lookin' for is more than likely me
But now I'm on some ""fuck you"" type shit
Your mind is so indecisive, bitch, cry
I'll no longer be ya tissue you can wipe with
You just triflin', you get screwed so much
I'm thinkin' that you like it, 
my prediction on
Your future is always right, I must be psychic, damn

See, I ain't even tryna affiliate myself with stupid
People like you anymore, it's the same damn story with
You every single time, don't be callin' me talkin 'bout
You fucked up, bitch, fuck you!

I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now
Baby, perhaps I should have been less nicer than I was to you
Cause this seems like all the good girls go for bad guys
And good guys get left behind

That's just the way that the story goes
Deep down bitches ain't nothing but clueless, horny hoes
They'll fill ya life up with drama like it's the Maury show
She'll turn her back on you even though she had sworn she won't
I never felt this sore before, here's what you do to be fair
You get a girl, fuck her while the opportunity is there, cause if you don't
Some other nigga will, best believe this shit is real and
When you find out what she's been doin' you'll fall and get the chills
Love is just a battlefield, some bitches be gettin' killed
Niggas too, it's the truth, better run and get your shield
Hoes will make ya think they at home waitin' for ya, sittin' still
But really, she's out with that guy you don't like and she's gettin' drilled
My heart is forever swollen, why'd I let you ever hold it?
Girl, you was my Bella and I thought I was your Edward Cullen
There's no rules to hop onto your boat, you'll take whatever floats it
Bitch, you turned my heart into a cave no one should ever go in

I can't stand these stupid bitches
Man, I just wanna take my hand
And put it around their fucking neck
And choke the fuck outta them! Ooh!
Fuck 'em all!

I should've fucked you when I had the chance to (the chance to)
Now I'm sittin' alone in my house and I'm wishin' you'd call me right now

You Are My Enemy,Raw,2010.0,"Yo, I work hard and barely get paid
How did I get stuck on this page
I've been starving for like six days
I should go and get a switchblade
And try to find out where this bitch stays
I'm a lit flame, what's your future I predict pain
Slit veins, squished brains I'm just saying
Locked in the basement causes madness and errors
All I have to talk to is the fucking man in the mirror
But you never saw it from my perspective
The craft that I perfected got rejected
And thrown out the window with no proper exit
I was humble, now I'm not as pleasant
I'm dropping wreckage on your shady dynasty, bitch I'am not to mess with
You made me think it was impossible that I could blow and get a little money from selling records for copping clothes
Let's talk about the 42 records that Hopsin sold
You sleeping on a fucking pot of gold, so listen close

Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

Yo, hold on one second, I gotta see who's next on this real quick
Oh, this stupid-ass
Alright

Yo, since when are buddies supposed to be so mean
There must be hate in the air that we both breathe
Shit we used to be tighter than emo jeans
The day I boss, stand back and watched the c-notes gleam
I know you see me blowing up, growing up it disturbs you
When my words move fanatics, and in return you gotta post little blogs on the internet
Talking about I've been a wreck, my career is wack I'll never benefit
I hope you die a bitter death
Then lie in a graveyard in regret
Where all of the foul niggas rest
You hating 'cause you witnessing the best
So just confess
You shattered our friendship and you can't fix the mess
I'm not a bit impressed by nothing you've done
My name's stuck on your tongue
Motherfucker you sprung
Give it up, move on
You've taken this shit too far
You mad 'cause you unsatisfied with who you are, bitch

Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
You are my enemy

Alright, lets see who else we got on this shit
Morgan
Alright, yo

You were the love I used to see in my dreams
But when we met, how come shit can never be what it seem
I was pleased with the things we did together
It's like we was a team
But you would change when I flee from the scene
Around me you were pure hearted, loving and caring
And when we hung out you'd even brighten up your appearance
You fooled me like you were smart, cute and something to stare at
But you was fronting little bitch, now I'm struggling to bare it
Because you were the opposite of what you told me you don't do
Drugs, one night stands and you know that it's so true
You saw my heart exposed, grabbed a hold and then broke through
Hoes are just so rude, fucking bogus and cold too
Oh but there's no dude you would let interfere
With our love, that's the exact shit you said in my ear
When you arrived in my world, I thought Heaven was near
But time made it very clear that the devil was here
So fuck you

Don't you ever call me again
I'm not your buddy
I'm not your pal
Right here is where it ends, ends, ends, sorry for you

Nigga these hoes better quit
Damn hoe shut the fuck up

Girl why you lyin' to niggas?
Actin' as if your life isn't boring
Yes the pussy was good but that is the
Only highlight of your story
You got these celebrities in your DMs
And you get invited to parties (nice)
Better enjoy it you bitch 'cause all of your
Looks gonna die when you forty
Look at your shit all the guys are absorbing
Hoe I'm talkin' don't try and ignore me
Oh that's your new BMW, right?
I got a couple 'cause I can afford these
You made a hustle off of guys who are horny
Gucci purses, vacations in Fiji
Trynna date you is easy
They just slide you some cash you just lay on the weewee
What the fuck do you stand for?
Everyday you actin' like a damn whore
You be showin' your ass on the dance floor
Niggas throwin' money till their hands sore
Now you handed it all to your landlord
You just hopin' you don't get evicted
I coulda sworn you were livin' way better than this
You just got so many gimmicks (yikes)
I don't get how it don't bother you
Who is the father who fathered you?
Bitch need a belt to that ass
If I was yo daddy that's probably what I would do
This goes out to all these wanna be models
Who flashin' titties just to get a like
Just take this advice: you pathetic, go get a life
You want dough you ain't gettin' mine

Bitch I can see what you tryna do
You got niggas outside in a line for you
For that pussy they'll spend it all for you
They got so much they can offer you
And you lovin' it, you strategizing
False advertising, god damn you lovin' it
But I ain't cho mans
Hoe, shut the fuck up!

Nigga these hoes better quit it
Nigga these hoes better quit it (quit it, quit it)
Nigga these hoes better quit it
Damn hoe shut the fuck up
Nigga these hoes better quit it
Nigga these hoes better quit it (quit it, quit it)
Nigga these hoes better quit it
Damn hoe shut the fuck up

Nigga these hoes better quit
Nigga these hoes better quit (quit, quit)
Nigga these hoes better quit
Damn hoe shut the fuck up

Lunch Time Cypher,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Yo man
Let's take this shit back to fuckin' high school lunch time cyphers
When mother fuckers was beat boxin'
And kickin' ill ass flows in the fuckin' cafeteria
Fuck all that Hollywood shit!
Let's fucking rap, man

Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?

I spent a long time tryna build a buzz
Hop is in the building, cuz
Step to me up on this battlefield, you know I will erupt
Didn't change, I'm still a nut
The girlies see my skills are up
So I be gettin' head every single night like a pillow does
When a nigga be flow bashin'
You know I be keepin it old fashioned
My compassion is so tragic on instrumentals when I toe tag it
Throw dirt on me? Then guard your face and stomach
Cause I'm swinging on you like ya ass cheeks had a rope hangin' from it
I'm out my mind, I can't configure it
I'm way too niggerish
I tried to read the Bible but I'm straight illiterate
With anger temperaments
I put myself in strange predicaments
They labeled this as sick
The doctor says to take some Ritalin
Man, I'm a lunatic,rockin' a crucifix
I'll mack on any chick I feel who got the cutest tits
I'm wanted, fugitive,robbin' yo whip to cruise in it
See, I'm the only kid on Elm Street that Freddy Krueger skipped
Pants saggin' cause they too loose to fit,I'm torturous
Grab a hammer and nail for your front door and board it shut
I stare deep in ya eyes, rip out your soul and absorb it up
And have Biggie Smalls yellin' out ""call the coroner!""
My groupies stay horny
They always call to say ""Hopsin can you fly me out to Cali?
Please pay for me""
I make that pussy pop for you like you skateboarding
Then you can come inside like a hurricane warning
I got a lot of sluts, I like to call it Hopsin luck
But now I feel like having sex with these bitches is not enough
I needed something new for moments when I gotta bust
So lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves
I got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny
I'll stab you in the brain with a knife
You can keep that in mind
You talkin' shit inside yo house, cool, fine, fuck it
I'll break in and stomp you out inside of it
Ain't tryna be ya friend
I'll knock you out and when you wake up
I'll just be standing there with a mischievous grin
Like""Ha, we meet again""
I'll puncture yo skin with a crack fiend's syringe
And drill your nut sack to the seat you're in
You want props? You don't deserve it, you're not ill
I won't stop 'til every rapper lurkin' has got chills
Why these niggas actin' like they certainly pop steel
When only time they carry heat is serving a hot meal
Since I was young, been on a mission to make dough
And put all my niggas on like this shit was a slave boat
So tell me why your songs sound like skittles and rainbows?
That's a dead giveaway you love to listen to Wayne bro
I'm sick and deranged when I'm spitting this strange flow
Stuck my dick in the game, that's the business I came for
Witness my pain grow, I don't kick it with lame folks
Simple and plain though, you gon remember my name ho, ha!

Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?

I'll snatch it from anyone when I dance with Satan
And detach more wigs than every female cancer patient that ever cared for a transformation
With a (diss joint | disjoint) sweeter than a diabetic amputation
When I split niggas, clipped quicker than big pictures
Heads get bodied with a single line like a stick figure
Cause my words are wild, and when I write
They can't wait for the sentence like family victims of a murder trial
Openly flow potently
Tighter than the choke-hold needed to put the Incredible Hulk to sleep
Tighter than the boatload of soldiers that stormed Normandy
Tighter than the hairy twat with the Virgin Mary's ovaries
They choke up like their throats cut when I show up
To keep the competition (win-free | Winfrey) like Oprah
Cause when I work with Hopsin, everybody who's hip
Is getting (killed | kilt) like a skirt from Scotland
Then I'll cock-back quicker than mouse traps
And stare as they pull (outta here | out a hare) like magicians tricking with Top hats
I got foreign objects
That'll get you (capped in America | Captain America) like Marvel Comics
With a strap like star guitarists
When this lead of mine see ahead in time like Nostradamus
Or swift jabs that swing left like crip flags
Will be the reason you break (next | necks) like whiplash!
So who the fuck wants war with this?
Distorted thoughts morphed this author to Spartacus
When he balls his fists around the swords he lifts with the force of a horses kick
Multiplied by the reason why god exists, and makes Thor his bitch!
Horror flick like imagery, organs everywhere..
You would swear I was orchestrating a Symphony!
It's passion, the force within him will cause the critics to look-n' drop dead like gorgeous women, hah!

Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
Fuck the principal, he can give me a fuckin' write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?

Don't get this shit confused
You're not a person, you're delicious food
No matter your race, birthplace, or religious views
All you niggas getting chewed
I eat a rapper, fitted cap first and then I spit out his tennis shoes
Missing screws in my top, I don’t have the patience
I grab the chop and leave you niggas eradicated
I never let the doctor give me shots, I'm unvaccinated
And I got small pox, you can have a blanket
Get assassinated and left with broken bones
If you gotta travel through the woods don’t go alone
I'm fucking bitches in a mobile home
Like a mutated nigga from the hills have eyes with no Trojan on
This is paranormal activity with a dagger
I got paranormal tendencies y'all just a pair of normal rappers
So why you talking like you not defenseless?
I punch you ten times in the mouth
And have your pussy asses hoppin fences
I got suspended for a few weeks in the 8th grade
When the principal caught me on the street tryna spray paint
I bought a dozen eggs from Safeway
And threw them at the muthafuckas house on the same day
You can get it the same way
I'm making bitch niggas walk the plank
In crocodile infested water mixed with toxic waste
Bury you alive with a camera strapped across your face
Then come back 2 weeks later and watch the tape
You cried like a bitch trying to make the coffin break
You died like a bitch instead of trying to concentrate
I'm here to depopulate on the red carpet with a sniper rifle
Taking out any nigga you nominate
So if you see me as soon as you turn the news on
Chances are I laid a nigga down like a futon
While you at work dealing with groceries and coupons
I got your bitch tossing my salad pass the croutons

Yo, check it
This that high school lunch time cypher
I might just step in this bitch and fuck ya life up
I hope the principal doesn't come and give me a write up
Now who the fuck I gotta snatch the mic from?

Yeah hah! Took it back to fucking lunchtime on these muthafuckas son!

I’m Not Crazy,Raw,2010.0,"Hello Hopsin
Word on the streets is that you're crazy
And I honestly believe you are

Listen, if I was really crazy I'd run up inside an orphanage
And torment kids, and beat babies faces with bags of oranges
Fake my origin and tell people that I was born to sin
I'd go back to filming molested porn again (Yeahhh)
I would murder a nigga then steal his body from whatever morgue it's in
And take it back to an alley to torture it
Study all of the Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, and Chuckie horror flicks
(Baby is that a knife that you have in your hand?) Of course it is!
I'd run around crazy like the Afghans do in some black camp boots wearin' a fuckin' Batman suit
And scream at bitches like I'm Fatman Scoop (C'MERE!)
And tell them to take a deep breath cause this will be their last chance to
I'd hate on everyone who's sane and gifted (Yup)
Then claim that my brain is missing while sniffing cocaine
And then cut my dick for the Pain Olympics
If I was crazy I would go pick up the mic and use it
And tell Dwayne Carter that I really like his music (Shit)

But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy

If I was manic I probably woulda neglected my responsibilities and made society respect it
I'd walk around in a dress with a can of gas
And blow up a mothafucka for laughing with half a match
Dig up all the baby cadavers and grab a basket
And shoot them through every window of every crib that I'm passing
I'd probably be back a couple hours later to fuck 'em with every bottle
I cut up within my labor
Take a breather, make a haste of it and bounce
Toward the house it's adjacent of and chase everyone out
And take em down
Tell them I'm the devil and I'm claiming everybody for a battle that's crazier than my brain is
Grab a chainsaw, blow the fuckin' dust back
Leave it all and still ready me a new blood bath
Run back to the psyche ward
Check my perimeter and get in before they knew that I left

But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy

Yo, I won't lie, I'm not as crazy as glue
But if I was let me describe all the bullshit I would do
I'd jack off with sandpaper while I'm watching the View
Picturing Whoopi bald headed stroking cock with her boobs!
I'll throw babies in dryers
Strangle tweakers that fidgit
Contract HIV willfully, just to purposely give it
I'd mug mothers on wellfare
Swim in gallons of gas
Meander to the batting cage and use my dick for a bat! (SHIT!)
If I was derranged, I'd cop me a chain
Make it rain like Washington and throw a stripper some change
Make her work it on the floor, pussy pop on a handstand
Lick her dirty snatch and film it all on my webcam (Oh yeah!)
Honestly I'd be itching for gunplay
I'll cock the .45 and shoot up church on a Sunday
I'll hi-jack a plane while it's still on the runway
Grope the stewardess and take the passengers' chump change!

But I'm not crazy
I'm just a tad bit strange
I can't control the thoughts that always travel through my brain
Oh no, not my fault
So don't blame me
I swear to you that I'm not really crazy
(Ah!) Crazy (Ah!) Crazy",https://genius.com/Hopsin-im-not-crazy-lyrics
Picasso,UnKnown,2019.0,"Hollywood, Hollywood, oh how I fuckin' love you
I cannot seem to break through from this curse that I've been stuck to
I came in as a lil man but now my fuckin' nuts grew
Today's the day our ties are finally cut loose, fuck you
Uh-oh, it's my triflin' ass (Uh-oh)
Pullin' up like, ""Hi guys, I'm back!"" (Hi)
Goddamn, nigga, I'm so up that I can't get down
Gotta skydive from that (Yikes!)
Won't see the day I might relax
I ain't never been a nice guy, in fact
Y'all wishin' I would try nicer raps
Sorry, I ain't got the right mind for that (Uh-uh)
Look how cold he is, pimpin' just like H-O-V is
Y'all are beyond saving and my rhymes stay inappropriate
This is just how my show begins
If you hatin', come blow me then
Fuck you, here's some petroleum
Give me my clout, you owe me it (Yeah)
Whoa! Niggas better duck and run for cover like it's fuckin' Iraq
(Stand down, nigga!)
I'm pouring liquor for your ass, you ain't even die yet (Oh no!)
I've been headin' up the ladder long enough
It's time I hit the climax (Yikes!)
Your career's goin' bye-bye, it's ironic you don't got a bypass
Niggas know that I've been ill
Man, the whole time that I've been here
I done made a fortune like ten mil'
From the paper lines that my pen fills
And if I don't spend it, my kids will
I'm low-key but a big deal
Hoes see me and they freeze up, that's why they all on my dick still

They tell me I'm too hostile, I am Picasso
Bitches like, ""Remember me from high school?"" Nah, ho
Came up in this shit killin' niggas with the hot flow
Y'all ain't got a fuckin' thing on Hop, whoa

Boy, you better rock slow
Who am I? I'm Picasso
Take the high road
ASAP 'cause I ain't liable
For no nigga (Nope!)
My fuckin' head is in the cosmos
Got it locked though
Bitch, I'm Pablo Picasso (Mhm)

I've been told the new game plan's
To make bullshit for the new age fans
And you can't pop unless you take Xans
And flex on the 'Gram like you do make bands
What? Oh no, they like, ""Fuck boom bap rap, you can't win""
""Save that shit for the Wu-Tang Clan""
That's when I bust in like the Kool-Aid Man
 (Yeah!)
Look, I ain't the nigga who pullin' up
Tryna get shine by how much the Rollie glow (Nah)
I'm here to rain on parades
My sinister ways to fuck up the rodeo (Woo!)
I do my shows and hoes
Be losin' control like I was the Holy Ghost (Stop!)
When I deliver the penis it lies in the mouth, she call it Pinocchio
Mmm, man, who want war with me?
Bitch, I torture beats, I've been born to beast
Still I abort MC's, oh so horribly
Dog, your corpse'll be right on the floor with these
Feet that I'll stomp you out with
This my house, bitch, and you can't afford the lease (Watch out!)
(Whoa) Fuck all that Hollywood shit
Over half of you not even lit that be ridin' my dick
I got no problem with this
I come through and your body is zipped, I could hardly resist
Nigga, my hobby is pissin' on anyone I can offend
I got no friends
Whoever thinkin' they hot, go and tell 'em nobody's convinced, hmm

They tell me I'm too hostile, I am Picasso
Bitches like, ""Remember me from high school?"" Nah, ho
Came up in this shit killin' niggas with the hot flow

Heather Nicole,Raw,2010.0,"At night in my window I see your silhouette
Crying heavy tears, look how wet my pillow gets
Throughout my days I don't smile I just get upset
And since you left look at all the shit that it affects
I take a picture of your face and I just hold it up
Kiss it, then reminisce on when it was both of us
It's hard for me to open up, I'm always talking to myself
But to nobody else
Some say that church or maybe counseling could probably help
But they don't know about all of my idiotic lies
All the fucking times I left you traumatized
Swore up and down to you saying I'ma try
And never did, I try not to cry but I feel bad I didn't apologize
It's time I cough it up and tell more, my soul is taken, never sell yours
I did some shit I probably coulda been in jail for
Bury me deep inside Hell's core
And don't let me out until you hear bells roar

She said, ""You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police""
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you

It's hard to forget, my heart is a brick
I tell myself ""Marcus, I thought that you were smarter than this""
The mess I put you through was worse than Pearl Harbor and shit
I'd always harm you and flip, mentally scar you and trip
Sometimes I'd argue and get the nerve to call you a bitch
Then bruise your back against the dresser that I tossed you against
My Juliet? At the time I never thought you was it
I do now but shit you're gone, so I just offer you this
A song to you, through it I open the crack in my chest
And show the whole world I've always had a lack of respect
For women who enter my life, I look to vengeance as knife
Intentions to fight, if you thinking I was senseless you right
Now every sentence I write, I think twice on it so I don't regret
'Cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness
I'm an unholy mess, put me in a hole to rest
Welcome to my life this is how painful my stories get

She said, ""You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police""
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you

Now use this track as a lesson
All you guys out there who have some aggression
Towards your woman it don't have to get hectic
That crap is pathetic, now look at me I have to regret it
I can't go near her or nothing, she'll probably have me arrested
The only thing I could do is just make a track with a message
And hope she hears it so she could know I was badly affected
I never meant to be that type of guy
But I realized that I was, and because of it I'm throwing my sinister life aside
I can cry at any moment just thinking about it
Sometimes I hide it from the folks that I'm hanging around with
I should apply for a new soul 'cause I think it's invalid
Somebody told me when I die I'll be safe but I doubt it
The grudge she holds against me, it hurts me so severely
She won't come near me, I thought that time was supposed to cure me
I'm so alone and weary, writing songs to heal me
I swear that I'm sorry Heather, I mean it so sincerely

She said, ""You never loved me, you just controlled me
If you fuck around I'm calling the police""
But all I wanted to say was I'm sorry
Oh, how I wish that could tell you

You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you
You're gone, you're dead
You'll never know that I was sorry
Just leave me alone, stay out my head
I wish that I could tell you",https://genius.com/Hopsin-heather-nicole-lyrics
Hotel in Sydney,No Shame,2017.0,"— Are you guys letting me go now?
— Yeah yeah, I'm afraid not, ya fuckin' dog of a cunt! Let's go, dickhead!
— Officer, you said I was only gonna be here for 30 minutes. It's been five hours, man, what's goi—
— Yeaaah, shut your fuckin' mouth, ya fuckwit, before I fuckin' bash ya!
— Man, what the fuck are you talkin'—
— Go inside, ya fuckin' wombat!
— Man, this is stupid.
— Go on, sit down!
— *sighs* Oh, god.
— Now, your missus claims you assaulted her.
— Psssssst.
— Bloody oath, man, why'd ya fuckin' beat her?
— Man, I didn't fucking beat her! Listen, I'm telling you…
I got her the engagement ring that she liked, booked a new flight
To come to Sydney, just to see her, start a new life
Man, she's 20 weeks pregnant and I was tryin' do right
For us, the family, the kid, but maybe I was too nice
My homie text me a picture and I just burst into anger
It was my girl in a bed with her personal trainer
I text my homie like, ""Yo, where you find this?""
He says, ""Snapchat, bro, it's all on my timeline, shit.""
Swear it struck a fuckin' nerve in my chest
I looked at my girl and said, ""Get a paternity test!""
She said, ""NO! Don't you get all worked and upset
I only slept in his bed right after work just to rest.""
I said, ""What? You expect me to believe that?
Ha, alright, yeah I'll 'relax'
Guess it doesn't seem bad
My girlfriend's with a buff nigga gettin' t-bagged.""
Officer, correct me if I'm wrong but she needed her head detached
I said, ""Bitch, I can't believe this shit!
Does he know you're pregnant? Is that his kid?
Look how big my headache is!
This whole time y'all havin' sex and shit
What type of nigga would fuck a pregnant chick?!
I said, ""Let's get this paternity test, I'm not kiddin', bitch!""
She said, ""No, I'm not gettin' it!""
Officer, I ain't seen her in months, I couldn't trust the lyin' whore
Plus she told me she slept with this guy before
And then I said, you know what? Forget it, it's all good, nevermind
Shit was makin' my blood pressure high
I love her unconditionally, you know, I can't pretend I ain't never lie
For the moment, I guess I'll let her slide
She said, ""If you don't want to take care of this kid, Marcus, then say so.""
I said, ""Wait, no, it's mine too, I can't go
How you gonna support this kid without me? You don't make dough.""
She said, ""Hahaha. I make loads.""
She had six grand cash
I said, ""But you was broke two weeks ago!
How you makin' chips that fast?""
She said, ""I bartend, I made it all in tips, ha ha.""
I said, ""Girl, you must take me as a big jackass.""
I'm like, ""Please, we both know money is hard to come by.""
Her bullshit might fly over the heads of some guys
Officer, she's always tellin' dumb lies
I've known her for six years, and she hasn't lifted a finger one time!
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""I bartend, duhhh, from tips. I'm a waitress.""
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She started stutterin' like, ""Uhm-uhh-mmm, Marcus, wait just—""
I said, ""Where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""Ok, ok, I'll tell you, just promise me you won't get mad.""
I'm like, ""Baby, where'd you get the cash from?""
She said, ""I work at a strip club… it's how I made the six grand.""
I said, ""Woaah, no… NOOO!""
I fell down in tears, my heart broke, I turned cold
I don't want the girl that I'm in love with doin' ho shit
If she needed cash I woulda loaned it, and she knows it
They won't let me get a refund on this $20,000 ring
Fuck, my head, it hurts, I need some ibuprofen
— Yeah, Mr. Hopson, you need a minute?
— Um, may I have some water please?
— Ah, no worries at all.
— I don't mean to cry and get emotional, but all this just bothers me.
— Yeah, it's alright, you're good… yeah here ya go, mate!
— Thanks… *sips water*
I wasn't me no more
I looked her in the eyes and straight told her
(What'd you say to her?)
I need you to tell me where this strip club is at
Or this family we're about to have is over
I said, ""Tell me where it's at!"" — she said, ""No.""
I said, ""You about to make me mad!"" — she said, ""So?""
I said, ""Bitch, you better panic and run, the damage is done
You're doin' this four months away from havin' my son! UGHN!""
I told her I would always have her back
I forgave her after all the careless acts
I have one question, and she couldn't share the facts
The strip club — how come she couldn't tell me where it's at?
Who the fuck she fuckin' in there?
Whose dick she suckin' in there?
Shakin' her fuckin' butt in the air
It's like we've argued for a thousand fuckin' hours, I'm annoyed
And I was at the point where somethin' was 'bout to get destroyed
I grabbed her purse, threw that shit across the room
I fuckin' launched it too
It was filled with makeup kits and all of her jewels
I blacked out; she said, ""What the fuck is wrong with you?""
She got up out the bed to get it, I pushed her ass back in it
I said, ""We're still talkin', bitch, you and I ain't finished
Now, this strip club, where is it? BITCH, WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?!""
I said, ""You know what? Fuck it. Awesome. Fine.""
In the process of all this drama, I had lost my mind
I felt lost and blind: the gym trainer, the strip club
The ring, the baby, she really crossed the line
And then I finally came down and all the madness was finished
Then she invited me to dinner with her family in Penrith
I said, ""I ain't goin' with you, you can leave now
I need to stay in this hotel room and figure some things out.""
Officer, I know you ain't gonna sympathize
I don't approve of any man puttin' hands on his girlfriend or wife
Especially when she's pregnant with his kid inside
Honestly feel like I wasn't in the wrong, but still I wasn't in the right
Ask her, she ain't got no bruises on her
I'm human, there's only so much that a dude can conquer
She knew that her actions reflected true dishonor
And tried to cover it, sayin' I'm an abusive monster
That's bullshit, huh, and that fast, poof
All of her wrongs are in the past, cool
She's just the innocent white girl
And I'm the black guy who always gets mad, true!
I know y'all about to make it hard for me to get back into Australia

The Old Us,UnKnown,2019.0,"I know this is super random
We done had our ups and downs and I done threw some tantrums
I honestly care about you way more than you could fathom
And God knows I ain't lyin’, if only you could ask Him
I know you think our happiness just comes and goes in occasions
When I leave Earth, I wanna be frozen in place
With a rose in a case full of love notes I wrote for the days I got to be next to you
That's how I feel and no one can change it, but
I gotta get this tension off of my chest
'Cause every day I feel a constant regret
Now I can reflect to see the issues we never dissolved or suppressed
I guess it’s only right that karma was next
And I'ma be open and honest with you, your absence is causing the stress
I wish the pain I feel would lay inside a coffin and rest
And it's only you who can soften my flesh
But still you run me in circles and lately you ain't been responding to texts
And now my only option is to act like I don't fucking need you
I bottle up the pain although the bottle's fucking see-through
I pray to God and wish that we could wash it up and re-do
Guess every love story just ain't got a fucking sequel
I just need to know if you feel the same
Why can't we kill the games and reconcile?
I know you still afraid, we both stuck
There’s no trust
, we gave our souls up the moment love had approached us, but—

Can we go back to the old us?
’
Cause I just don't fuck with this new you
Lately you ain’t showin' no love
You act like I never knew you
We need to stop the games right now
Let's stop the games, baby
I need you to ease the pain right now
I need you to keep it real with me, my love
Can we go back to the old us?
'Cause I just don’t fuck with this new you
Lately you ain't showin' no love
You act like I never knew you
We need to stop the games right now
Let's stop the games, baby
I need you to ease the pain right now
I need you to keep it real with me, my love
Can we go back to the old us?

On my end there was mistakes made, I had too much pride to take blame
The moment my fame came, my ways changed
I couldn't stay sane and started making our sunny days rain
And even though my life has moved on, our history's too strong to forget
I won't pretend I ain't stained
And if you open up my fucking chest and take a look in my heart
I swear to God you gon' see yo' engraved name
How you gon' leave me hanging?
How you gon' leave me achin'?
I never did get my closure, so how you gon' mediate it?
How you gon' be when Zade is old enough to understand that his daddy isn't around?
How we gon' be related?
And I just want my family on track, that's the plan we both had
Shit is sad because I'm askin' for a chance we don't have
I fucking love you
And I just had to grab my notepad just to write a song for you saying—

Can we go back to the old us?
'Cause I just don't fuck with this new you
Lately you ain't showin' no love
You act like I never knew you
We need to stop the games right now
Let's stop the games, baby
I need you to ease the pain right now
I need you to keep it real with me, my love
Can we go back to the old us?
'Cause I just don't fuck with this new you
Lately you ain't showin' no love
You act like I never knew you
We need to stop the games right now
Let's stop the games, baby
I need you to ease the pain right now
I need you to keep it real with me, my love
Can we go back to the old us?

Tears to Snow,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Man, Fuck!
Me and my girl keep arguin'
Somehow my life just got hard again
She's scared of groupies that steady bargin' in
I can't explain the pain my heart is in
Yeah I got money, but reality isn't sunny, it's dark and grim
See when I'm tourin' I don't take her
So she get filled with anger, thinkin' another woman is gon' replace her
She standing in tears of emotion knee deep
I keep tryna tell her ""Why? I ain't fuckin' no groupie!""
She don't believe me
My career is so deceiving
She's dating a rapper, nobody said it was gon' be easy
She threatening to leave me cause of these text messages girls send
Now I'm just caught in this whirlwind
Tryna explain they just friends who can't control themselves
They see the fame, think I'm cute, and they get overwhelmed
She should fuckin' know the deal
I'm done dealing with this bullshit
Bitch, I'm outta here, you can go to Hell

There's no room to drive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow
Will they ever learn to love me? (ever learn to love me)
Don’t fucking call me
Stop trying to reach me
I ain’t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me

The underground ain’t been the same since I emerged from it
Niggas hear my name and they just hate, and throw some dirt on it
Talking 'bout I blew up and just left them in the dust
But we ain’t friends mothafucka we ain’t neva kicked it once
You better zip it shut, I’m respectful
But if I spot you that’s the only time that I won’t ever give a fuck
Your words can make a difference, do not forget
If you run your mouth and talk shit, you payin' for what comes out of it
Bitch niggas acting all macho, jealous 'cause they ain’t got dough
While they still 
won’t put enough
 for me at my show
Smiling coming over to me, like I’m the coldest MC
And then you bad mouth the moment I leave
Aight, I got it since I’m in the limelight
You niggas try to look cool by not being hyped about my hype
Simple and plain, better watch where your missiles are aimed
Insult my name you’ll rekindle a flame, nigga

There's no room to drive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow
Will they ever learn to love me? (ever learn to love me)
Don’t fucking call me
Stop trying to reach me
I ain’t tryna hear all of your bullshit, just leave me

I’m about to lock myself in my basement and dig my grave inside
All jokes aside, man I see no reason to stay alive
If I do it, I won’t even say “good-bye”
“Ya, ho, but you’re Hopsin, and you have so many fa-ans!“
Yeah, great advice
I’m not lucky
Outside of Hopsin, there's no one who loves me
I come home to absolutely nothing
Nobody pays any mind to Marcus
They treat me like I’m retarded
They just want me to slave away as an artist
It don’t make any sense to me
No one wants to get to know the real me
They just want some pictures for they friends to see
I deal with this kind of stress, endlessly
Fuck this damn industry
Look at all the shit that it just did to me
I don’t care about no big collab or tryna swim in cash
I just want a family I can watch the TV with and laugh
Until then, I’m on the dark side
I’m the fuckin’ Dark Knight, startin’ bar fights
Just a hard life

There's no room to drive at the end of the road
When you're living in the cold not wearing a coat
The breeze turns tears to snow
Will they ever learn to love me? (ever learn to love me)
Don’t fucking call me
Stop trying to reach me

My Love,Pound Syndrome,2015.0,"Baby, I know we goin' through shit and you feel like there ain't no solution
You say I'm a nuisance and think I be playin' these games with your heart and not purposely bruise it
That's when I lose it and flip, put the blame all on you like it's all your fault
Now I'm goin' through your phone, you goin' through mine, and we wrestlin', I'm hopin' you don't call no cops
Baby, I love you, don't be jealous of females I know that I've met down the way
You mention they name on a regular basis and you just be givin' the space in my brain
You'll look me straight in the face, swear that I'm stickin' my penis up in every girl that I'm friends with
And that's the moment I say, ""I don't even know why I'm in a relationship, I want to end it""
Let's just chill the fuck out, girl, we livin' in the same damn house
Everywhere I go, you go, and you go, I go, so what we naggin' about?
Shit, not a goddamn thing, maybe we just like to hear ourselves talkin'
We do it way too often, I think we both lost it
Our love just might be in the coffin, oh shit

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love

I feel like your parents don't like me, I hate that you tell 'em our problems
See, when I first met 'em I knew that they fell in love with me, but then I fell straight to the bottom
Now your daddy textin' me sayin' to fly you home and he bein' so passive aggressive
Then I'm like ""Sure you gon' pay for her ticket?"" That is the question, dammit I'm stressin'
I've been sufferin' from manic depression, baby it takes a real man to confess it
I don't care if you confront me with issues you got, just be careful with how you address it
'Cause sometimes you attackin' me the wrong way, and then my mind think the wrong way
Then all of a sudden I be actin' like I got no brain, and I'm doin' foul shit like it's okay
But don't say I ain't ever tryna make things better, you been the only focus since the day we met up
Every time we get into it, you got me wishin' that I never broke up with my girlfriend back in Maryada
You say I don't love you then I don't know what else to do
'Cause I don't want nobody else but you
I know that I've been hurtin' you and you've been hurtin' me
So baby let's get it right because fightin' doesn't help the bruise, we both lose

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love
I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love
Ain't nobody gon' die for you like I'll die for you, my love

Why do we fight so often?
These games are oh so ridiculous though we cannot let this shit get to us
We just need to focus on the brighter side so we can make it
And if you ain't doin' somethin' I like, then I promise you that I'ma be a little more patient

'Cause these bad vibes are contagious and our relationship is now breakin'
And I know, I know, I know your heart is constantly achin'
It's like I snatched it out of your chest and tore it up, just tore it up
And I, I played the bad guy towards you more than once, yes, more than once
Man, this shit be frustratin' me
If you ain't the one then who may it be?
We tried to make love, but we made a beast
Now we just stuck 'cause we can't agree
This is my heart, please take a piece
And put it in a safe place to remind you
There's a million other guys in the world to choose
But none of 'em will ever love you like I do, baby

I don't give a fuck what the people that surround you do believe
Ain't nobody else in the world that's out there for you but me
Ain't nobody gon' ride for you like I'll ride for you, my love

Fort Collins,Pound Syndrome,2015.0,"Yeah, early 2014 I was on the Knock Madness tour
I was mad about it, I half-assed my album 'cause I really didn't know what I was rapping for
I was going through a break up and that was hard
I wasn't in my right mind, nigga that's for sure
Every night I was praying and I would ask the Lord
To please give me strength, so I don't slam the door on my fans
But no luck I was stuck
Even though a nigga had a plus size buzz
I didn't even know who the fuck I was
I tried so hard to see a plus side, but
I couldn't find the spark inside the dark
Even with my crew saying nice remarks
It felt like some darts were stuck inside my heart
I was thinking that a brand new life's the start
But I couldn't leave, I made a commitment
On my off time the fans invaded my business
So I started feeling a gang of resentment
Flipping on everybody when they ain't even did shit
I needed to go home and gather my thoughts
I didn't wanna suicide as the result
So the night at my Fort Collins show before I hit the stage
I left through the back for a walk and no one saw
I thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or somethin'
And a voice had told me to keep walking
And do not step foot on that stage for nothing
So I kept on walking
Then I camped out up in an abandoned house
I hated this rap shit and I hated my life
The spotlight does that when you can't get out

'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

It just doesn't feel so right lately
(Money and the fame)
Don't know where I'm going tonight baby

It just doesn't feel so right
Don't know where I'm going tonight
Someone guide me to the light, please

I got a girl back home, yeah
God know she the sweetest thing on earth
I can't sleep on her
But there's too many women on tour and I try not to cheat on her
Man, my options for pussy are unrealistic
There's bitches who'd give up a lung for this dick
My music be leaving 'em sprung and twisted
The average nigga would have fun with this shit, that's real
Here is a secret, you don't have to keep it between you and I
Upcoming rappers who 'bout to be touring, I promise the road will eat you alive

But you know that shit when you rise
And by no surprise, I'm not gon' feed into the lies
No, I'm not gon' say that you wrong
But I'm not gon' say that you right, it's hard to keep quiet
When all I do is hold you down
If I ain't know you then, well I feel like I know you now
I know you had a little doubt, but to hop off stage and find out
You done walked out, and you not taking nobody calls
You don't wanna deal with it
But I'm looking at these fans like 'damn, there's a lot of y'all'
You got me tripping with the bodyguard
Like ""Nigga, how the fuck you lose the headliner?""
Now I don't care that you left the show
I just wish you woulda let me know
'Cause I don't know if you've been kidnapped
Or know somebody from the city where they live at
But, the way you went about it make it hard for me to feel bad
Honestly it made a nigga real mad
'Cause I'm texting you like, ""Hop the devil just testing you
And Fort Collins got respect for you""
And that's why the next day, you was like

'Cause I been on this road, tryna get high from my low
Won't somebody tell me where to go, please 'cause I don't know
I might be crazy, living life like a circus ape that's strapped into a car seat
And I'm hoping that y'all can forgive me, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry
Fort Collins, I'm sorry, Fort Collins, I'm sorry

It just doesn't feel so right lately

While yellin' goodbye to my family
I had to do a little soul search (Yeah)

They tell me I should go out and mingle, it don't work (What?)
I've contemplated on whether or not to smoke Purp (No)
Think you sick in the head? Come visit my shed
I live on the edge, let's jump, shit, I'll go first
Mmm, yikes, quite preposterous (Yeah)
White kids soaking up the hype up off it
Hi, I'm Hopsin, I'm obnoxious
I've been token like the guy from Boston
Watch me rise to top ten (Yeah)
You know what I mean? Ain't no one like me

Labeled a clown, labeled deranged
Labeled as someone you might put to shame
Labeled a freak, who's unable to change

Some of these niggas really 'bout it

Shit, it might be me next, I really mean it
The reject that you all love, I ain't He-Man

They hate the planet so they come at you lookin' for revenge
That's why I gotta go to sleep with the nine tucked
Niggas creepin' up, fuck it, I ain't leavin' survivors
One squeeze and your spine bust
Ugh, actually, I don't want yo' dirty corpse on my carpet
Get the fuck out of here
My attitude is that of a Hulk smash
Mixed with Tony Montana snortin' bags of his coke stash
If it's true that I'm a savage at cold rap
I might as well rock a white jacket and pope hat
Dissin' me is like having your throat gagged
And fucked 'til your insides saggin' and prolapse
Big and 'Pac was a tragedy, no cap
But hearin' me rap is like having 'em both back
Yeah, so how can you deny an alpha rude as I?
Livin' on cloud nine, better believe the altitude is high

'Bout to lace you motherfuckers with an album you can buy
Yes, I had to go retarded, I was dropped at birth (Yah)

Yup, just a normal day, on my favorite website, backpage.com
I was scrollin' through hoes, lookin' for a bitch to fuck
I'm like, ""That babe, uh huh.""
I was just about to call her
Then I saw an ad pop up, I'm like, ""Wait, oh my God!""
You see, I had a really long day
And I just could not turn down an Asian massage
So, I called 'em up and I said
""Hello, when is your next slot available?""
She said, ""You can come right now.""
Fuck yeah! ""Hurry up, because I'll wait for you!""
I pulled up and I sat in the waiting room
Is this shit all a setup, it's debatable
If I get confronted by the police
I just want a massage, I am not here to break the rules
Then an Asian lady had a pen and told me
""Come over here to the counter!""
Then she ask me if I wanted to get a session
For 30 minutes or an hour
I said, ""Hmm uh, I'll take 30
Nah, matter of fact I'll do an hour, fuck it.""
'Cause I know whatever's 'bout to go on
Behind those doors I'm 'bout to love it
She say, ""Usually 50 dollar but for you I do 45.""
I say thank you and gave her the money
Then she say, ""Okay, let's go inside!""
I'm like, ""Fuck yeah!"" – it's about to go down right now
So good what I found right now
I'm about to let it all out right now, yeah

Look, so I walked back to the massage room
She said, ""Take your clothes off, and then put this robe on!""
I'm like, ""Okay, no prob'.""
Oh God, this about to be so fun
And no one even knows; she left, I got undressed
And all the sudden a new Asian girl walked through the door
She said, ""Hello, how are you?
I am Muli, that's what you can call me
And I give you lovely Asian massage.""
I've been waitin' for this all day
I position myself on the table
And put my face down in the circular cushion
And she started massagin' my back
I knew somethin' was up with the way she was lookin'
Then she slid her tiny little finger tips
Down my spine right over my buttcrack
She was massagin' my booty
Then go to my thighs and start touchin' my nutsack
Fuck yeah!
Then I put a little bitty sway in my hips to let her know I like it
Somethin' was 'bout to go down
You can see it a mile away, you don't have to be psychic
She said, ""You want somet'ing?""
I said, ""Yes I do.""
She said, ""You big strong man, I really like you!""
I said, ""I like you too.""
Then she said, ""You want the hand, sucky, fucky?
Tell me right now 'cause I need to know!""
I said ""I'll have all three of those""
Then I thought ooh she a little freaky ho
She said, ""I give it to you for cheap, you give me 125 dollar""
I said, ""Okay, here you go!""
Lowkey I was feelin' kinda awkward
She jacked me off and gave me my top first
I stayed quiet as I watched her
My dick had a strong posture
She said, ""You very big like a monster!""
She got naked then I humped her
I'm lovin' this little tiny Asian booty, I swear that this girl is the best
I'm buildin' a sweat, I'm killin' it yes
I pulled out and spilled on her breast
Everything was just right
I hit the hour on the deadline
I guess I'm gonna leave now
She said, ""That's fine, thank you, come again next time!""

Because they shit don't sell, now that's a big old fail
But the punch is a lot harder when you clip your nails
Niggas, how you expect to drive when you ain't get your L's?
You was the next big thing while I was last
You was poppin' tags while I was mad chillin' in my pad with my rhyming pad
Tryna record with no door so I hear my mom and dad
Arguing upstairs so I gotta wait 'til the drama pass
'Cause my mic be picking that shit up
But I ain't wanna give up, I'd exhale fast even if I did suck
You want the madness? Then come and get some
I'm takin' the cake, and all that's left for y'all is the pieces I bit from
See I ain't buddy-buddy with rappers because that shit is fake
Most of y'all morals is fucked up, you on a different page
You get no props just 'cause you getting paid
If you garbage we ain't doing business, point blank, I discriminate
And I don't do no bullshit collabs to get my name poppin'
That ain't even considered a safe option
And that just ain't Hopsin, I paid homage, now I'm straight wilin'
Now turn this shit up while the bass knockin', now c'mon

The fiends are knocking at my door
Should I give them what they're asking for?
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness
So what the fuck y'all need from me?
I'm here to make these fiends believe
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), gotta have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness

And I be gettin' comments like
""Hop, what's the hold up with your new shit, man?, you be taking forever son
Yo I'ma stop waiting, I'm getting my hopes up
With your work ethic it ain't gon' ever come
You had the XXL cover in 2012
And I thought you would soon prevail, but homie, you ain't doing well
You hit us with that Ill Mind shit and that was cool as hell
But when it comes to your album, you never got no news to tell
Your whole career is just a train wreck
You toured around the world for 3 years, but you always performed the same set
I been asked you to come to my city, but you ain't came yet
I guess you ain't in it for love, you just want that pay check
If I was you, then I wouldn't be too proud
You signed Dizzy not too long ago and he's bigger than you now
You said you saving hip-hop, well, save this shit
And all I hear is wack niggas and I hate this shit
Homie I stopped being a scrub because of you
I stopped playin' these bitches in the club and fell in love because of you
My dad heard your song and he stopped doin' drugs because of you
I learned to rap and even built a little buzz because of you
But you take it for granted, thinking you have it made
Sittin' back in the shade, Hopsin, there's people that you have to save
This is beyond music
You speak life into these motherfuckers, Hop, you have a gift, so when you gon' use it?""
Damn, I have that much of an impact?
My rhymes did that?
 Sometimes, I really feel my shit's wack
That's why I kick back, 
but fuck this shit, yo, where my pen at?
I'm 'bout to kill this shit and make niggas just wanna quit rap
I'm causing havoc, layin' the rappers like a hammock
If I want the fucking planet, I can have it, now try to snatch it
Only God can stop my violent habits
You niggas average, I ain't even in my prime and still I'm twice the savage
C'mon

The fiends are knocking at my door
Should I give them what they're asking for?
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Knock Madness
So what the fuck y'all need from me?
I'm here to make these fiends believe
They want it (want it)
Need it (need it), gotta have it (have it)
Woah—oh (woah)

Twisted,No Shame,2017.0,"You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up
You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—

I see myself as Bruce Banner
Some people say I'm a loose cannon
I only came here to do damage
Not 21, I'm just too savage
Go ahead and get you some new glasses
But I am unseeable, dude can it
I will applaud you if you manage
I now reside on a new planet
Nigga my ego is on Eiffel
Piss a nigga off, I ain't really gonna see no high road
""Damn, Hop, why you seem so spiteful?""
Steppin' on niggas like fee-fo-fi-fum
Get used to my trifle ways
When enemies got a price to pay
I don't really fit in with none of you niggas
When I'm near you I feel like a metal in a microwave
I'd much rather be at home all alone by myself
Fuck your support, I can buy it myself
Foes be the real reason why I melt
Y'all get around me and eyein' my wealth
I don't need anyone sideline help
Pain in my eyes every time I yelp
If I don't relax then my mind might swell
But I guess that's life, oh well
So here's my hypothesis: the old me does not exist
Y'all like, ""What Hop is this?""
I'm not here for peace, I'm not here for love
Bitch, I want the opposite
So fuck all the compliments! Fuck being positive!
I'm in my prime, but I ain't no Optimus
Shit's about to go down, I can promise it, biatch!

How you tryna drive from the backseat?
I been runnin' things like an athlete
Pedal to the metal goin' max speed
Sippin' Red Bull 'cause I barely had sleep
Laboratory smellin' like a gas leak
Goin' up in flames when the track beat
I made a 100 motherfuckin' K last week
Niggas feelin' me like Mr. King's last speech
When you mix in a lot of hardcore revenge
A pitchfork and sins, then misfortune wins
You can cop you a house up in Porter Ranch
And pull up on these hoes in Porsche or Benz
So many fake friends, I'm bored of friends
Life feel just like I'm bordered in
Have I talked to the Lord? I sorta been
I been battlin' with life in a tournament
Let me spit the facts
Bitch, relax, I lift the match and build the shit from scratch
First empire I built, shit collapsed
Had bad splits 'til my lips were chapped
Back in high school where not many kids could rap
But I engineered they ass just for cash
Niggas couldn't see where my head was at
In my living room where I rest the plaques
So here's my conclusion
As I sit in this booth I condition to bruise
I'm vicious and gruesome, you're listenin' to
Some premeditated murder, yes, I meant to intrude
It's Panorama city, madness up against me
You see Prodigy the rapper TAC committee
I been rappin' 'fore the world tell me not to go sittin', like—

You better not get it twisted, nigga

You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Respect my name when it leave your mouth
You better not get it—

Welcome to my euphoria
This is a place where I'm too victorious
This ain't a place where the grass is greener
This is a place full of mad demeanor
Look sideways, catch a bag of fever
Niggas stay shooked like they havin' seizures
My life's a movie, this track’s a teaser
So recognize the real nigga

You better not get it twisted, nigga
For real, no doubt, no doubt (no doubt!)
Big shit sick, real thick bitch, when I roll up

Hip Hop Sinister,Knock Madness,2013.0,"I'm changing man
I thought I was supposed to be this hip hop savior
But I have turned into a sinister

Yeah, wack niggas prepare to die
You ain't got nowhere to hide
I'm knockin' at your fuckin' door
You scared 'cause you know Hell arrived
Niggas gon' get dealt with rhymes
It's just me, myself and I
I low-key run this rap shit
You don't know 'cause it ain't televised
This is war, gentleman (kill)
My flow is filled with more venom
Than George Zimmerman in his car chillin'
With a loaded .44 tucked into his drawers fidgetin'
And itchin' to find a brand new casket to store niggas in
Y'all just make me laugh and giggle
Call me out on tracks then bitch I'll pound on you
Like that vendin' machine that stole my pack of Skittles
Niggas thought the old me dissolved and I went soft
After my album Raw but nah bitch I evolved
I'm takin' over shit easily
I rarely do collaborations 'cause y'all ain't qualified to be in a league with me
Hop just let the beast unleashed
Someone get this freak a leash
I'm snapping on all you, leavin' every MC deceased

I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder

Motherfucker we makin' history
A million independently
So kiss my fucking ass
Left or right you get to pick the cheek
You don't ball you just pretend you do to make the chicks believe
But your label is fucking you like Ruthless Records did to me
Stop with the compliments, I've been locked in my momma's den
Plottin' when I will be droppin' this Hopsin apocalypse
Bombin' the competent
Rap goblins mobbin' the continent
Gotta be dominant
I'm surprised that God isn't vomiting
I'm wearin' a badge, tearin' your ass
Another vag, cuttin' through necks, 'til they barely attached
Me and this game are one of the same, like Jarren and crack
The darkness is arrived, so make a flare with a match
You got skill? Where is it at?
I haven't seen it, who dares to attack a genius?
You'll get managed I'll have you gag your penis
Until you throw up your own liver (nuts)
I don't give a (fuck), the flow ripper (what)

I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder

Now if I stop being who I am, that would upset me
I'll never change for none of your wack-ass deadbeats
I struggled to change for J. Christ to accept me
I don't even change clothes, shit not even my bed sheets
When I step inside the booth and rhyme
Rappers commit suicide
And jump in front of a moving semi-truck
Like it was cool to die
Niggas is watered down
Fuck it it's time to scuba dive
Better get on your knees and pray to God and hope that you survive
Killin' rappers like I condone violence
I murder you and when your soul is floatin' to hell I ghostride it
You won't last living in this cold climate, so don't try it
I know I'm ill, well I don't need no pussies to co-sign it
Commercial niggas thinking they carry the torch
It's going to be very hilarious when I bury your corpse
So next time you spit a fucking rhyme that's too simple
I'll jump kick your ass through the glass of the booth window

I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder
I'm the motherfucking hip hop sinister
Murder, nigga murder
'Cause niggas thought I was done, but I ain't finished up
Murder, nigga murder",https://genius.com/Hopsin-hip-hop-sinister-lyrics
Bout the Business,UnKnown,2016.0,"Seems like yesterday when a nigga had no luck
Seems like yesterday when a nigga had no bucks
Seems like yesterday when the world ain't give no fucks
And yesterday, after yesterday, and today I'm—

These bitches know I'm the man
After the break up I gotta be, started Undercover Prodigy
I've been in counseling, sermons in churches
But still they can't get these fucking demons outta me
What's my philosophy? How'd I get the world to rock with me?
How'd I get this killing following?
How'd I go from being no one in Panorama City to being famous from boggling everyone's mind?
I don't go to bed as early, I be up all night up until 7:30 in the morning
My legacy's legendary, you will never catch a nigga stepping dirty
I know God has got me, I don't ever worry
I get it by any means necessary
The haters want my career dead and buried, that's a long shot, fuckin' Stephen Curry
Bitch I know, I done revived my whole plan
Fuck the matrix, I had to break it and now I'm the program
You won't ever catch me bowin' down in the eyes of no man
Why should I be co-dependent? Mothafucka I'm the golden ticket
This is my show and you don't get no admission
You won't survive a head-on collision
Man, I'm so committed, I done broke a business
Froze a business, the new U-P coalition
Got you, eyein' all of this dough I'm gettin', pussy
Niggas do not get no percentage when it's time to rock
I'm the coldest with it
So don't ever question it, it is evident
Just when you thought a nigga fell off
I am back from the dead again, I am The Revenant

Man, life is a struggle, you know what it be like (For real)
So I gotta get it, I'm sure you can see why (I do)
If niggas ain't eating, we hitting the green light (Come on)
I'm bout to put on for 8-18 like

Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (Yeah, a nigga popping, ain't he?)

My life isn't the same, why would it be?
I got haters who thinkin' so crookedly (I do)
I'm fed up, I said fuck it and took a leap (I did)
Now I'm killing shit, my nigga, look at me (Damn)
A boss in the building got niggas cryin' steady, caught in they feelings
I'm like a deadly roman dog in the village
It's fuck 'em all if they involved with the villain
I shit on anything you thought was appealin'
I hope you eatin' with the pay decreased
I be feastin' just to say the least
I might flee away and take a freak
Out to Fiji, maybe stay a week (Woo)
Maybe three, shit I'm debatin' geez
All the problems when you makin' cheese, nigga
I'ma reinvent the 8-18, goddamn it
I'm sorry I had to stunt
Sometimes I'm a massive cunt
I clown niggas and I laugh a bunch
Talk shit when I grab my nuts
I'm DMing and all the ratchet sluts
My story doesn't happen much
I backed off, now I'm back for lunch
I pack a punch, get active chump
You probably had to hunch
I do best when I'm mad as fuck
I'm mad corrupt, this accurate
Man, I couldn't see myself stuck in the trench
I just had to give it one hundred percent
Man I couldn't live with myself knownin' all this time I been on this planet wasn't for shit
Shout out to all the fans who been holding me down ever since day one
Keepin' my name up, FV is bankrupt and the Prodigy came up

Man, life is a struggle, you know what it be like (For real)
So I gotta get it, I'm sure you can see why (I do)
If niggas ain't eating we hitting the green light (Come on)

Fuck any nigga who tryna kill what I'm doin' here
I've been up for nights just tryna keep this shit movin' (A nigga popping lately)
Nigga fuck the club, these hoes can wait, if you don't relate
Then you should probably keep an eye out on shit that you doin' (A nigga popping lately)
And who said it can't be me, I've been up grindin' for 80 weeks nigga

Chris Dolmeth,Gazing at the Moonlight,2009.0,"His name is Jesse, we kicked it since we was little kids
Throughout his life there's a bunch of stuff that he shouldn't have did
He was cool but there's a lot of stuff he could have fixed
But addicted to drugs is what I had thought he couldn't get
Until he had started hanging around them other kids
Who showed him how to drink a Corona and puff a cig
And introduced him to weed with added supplements
So whenever he was feeling down he'd take a couple hits
It ain't really bother me cause it was nothing big yo
It only bothered me when he started to fuck with crystal
I'm sure he knew that doing it wasn't a smart move
He'd walk around with humongous pupils like cartoons
I tried to tell him his life goals'll be ruined
But he just told me to ""chill out"", he knows what he's doing
And now I'm thinking hard if I should get hostile
And said fuck it
And watched him take it right up his nostril

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me

Eleventh grade where he's supposed to be
But he's in the ninth
He'd wake up for school feeling like it's the end of life
He'd hop off his bunk bed to go and sniff a line
A couple minutes later, now he's energized
He'd go to school and wide open's how he'd get his eyelids
Then he'd get excited
Cause he finished his assignments
Now it's big surprises from the teachers when they find it
Jessy's doing all his work
Well shit aight then
I guess it wasn't that bad after all that he did meth
It made him actually do his work, and not cheat on tests
It boosted up his confidence, he felt like he's the best
He'd stay up all fucking night like he don't need to rest
Until he had none left
Now he's acting strange
He couldn't buy anymore, cause he didn't have the change
So he sold his Xbox and his whole rack of games
I never thought that the crystal could make him act this way

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me

Jesse's sister walked inside of his room to get something out
Then she noticed Jessy on the bed foaming from his mouth
Now she's tearing up, scared as fuck
Oh he's done it now
So she picks up the phone gives 911 a dial
She tried to give him CPR, before the kid was lost
Then he had woke up and saw her on him and it pissed him off
All of sudden he went crazy just to fucking get her off
He threw her up against the wall so hard it made a picture fall
He can't really get a grip
She can't believe he did this shit
She kinda knew what made him flip
She yelled, it's drugs isn't it
And now the paramedics at the door
So she runs down to open it and they run up with all these antidotes
They tried to tackle him but he's too hard to handle though
They called for back-up
So the station sent another van to go
When they arrived he was spitting in their face and eyes
So they injected him until he had a stable mind
They told his sister that it's time for them to take a ride
You lucky that your brother made it
Cause he almost died
She went up to say bye but he must have dozed off
And I had barely pulled up when the truck drove off
From our apartment buildings, so I didn't see crap
And I ain't get to see him till he got out of rehab
Even when he got out he was still depressed
Until he heard a little tiny voice in his head that said

Excuse me do you need a ride
Looks like you're going downtown
Yes, hop in my ride
Well hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth
Hi I'm Chris Dolmeth
Chris Dolmeth, come ride with me",https://genius.com/Hopsin-chris-dolmeth-lyrics
I Don’t Want It,UnKnown,2019.0,"This'll probably be the last song that I come out with for a while
I'm sorry to all my fans

I always think of Robin Williams, someone we loved and who we saw appealing
He made us all laugh as adults and children
Shit, all the millions that he had, I wonder what were his thoughts and feelings five minutes before the belt that cut his breath off and killed him
Prolly something like my thoughts now
What goes up has gotta fall down
I guess I'll pour it all out 'cause right now, the reaper's in the room visiting
So if I do leave, at least you'll know why I did it then
It started way back then when I was a kid at first
Niggas bullied me when they saw that I was an introvert
I was never cool, had no friends, no chicks would flirt
Every school year it's like all my issues were getting worse
My whole life they was calling me corny; stupid
I never had a dad who was there to mentor me through it
Skateboarding was my escape, it wasn't just for amusement
My issues kept reoccurring so I would resort to music
I'd vent about the burdens that were sitting in my heart
I'd vent about the way I fell from swimming with the sharks
My mom was always working, so our bond was stripped and ripped apart
Ain't no fucking family memories, ain't no pictures at the park
Then I thought, ""The world is about to see Hell come
And I'ma live the good life everyone else wants""
And in that moment my tears dried and I felt numb
Then years later I blew up, the mission was well done

I don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more
(No more)
No more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more
(No more)
No more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)

Finally I was famous, people kissing my ass
I knew that I was only here 'cause it's revenge from my past (It's crazy)
Went from a loser in school who got the worst grades
To being praised for all my verses when I dispersed rage
I copped a whip, moved out the ghetto like, ""Bye, haters""
Bought a brand new house with a bunch of white neighbors
Everyone started calling wanting like five favors
And guess what? All of it dealt with spending my paper
And I was nice, I'd give 'em cash, I'd show sympathy
I gave him some, him, and her, I'm just lending cheese
Now I'm just looked at like an ATM machine
If I don't give my friends my money, shit, I'm the enemy
I had about a million new best friends that I just met
Some were plotting to build me a death bed
All because they kept on putting wack songs out that no one's impressed with
So out of jealousy they'd diss me, you fucking guessed it (Ha)
At least I had my squad; Jarren, Dizzy, Hoppa, SwizZz
I knew we'd stick together, stuck in this chaotic biz
We had it all figured out and had a lot to give
It was Funk Volume for life, who want a problem, bitch?
Then all the sudden, out of nowhere we parted ways
2016 – those were some of my darkest days
Ask us all, ""Whose fault was it?"" Ain't hard to say
But it was due to money and all of our bonds had started to fade
Months later, my girl told me she's pregnant
This was something I never expected
Her and I weren't on good terms at the time, man, it was hectic
And I was scared if she kept this baby I might regret it
Mainly because her and I had a fucking toxic relationship
Last thing we need is a fucking toddler to raise in it
Having a baby is great, but not as amazing when you got two parents who always fighting, hollering, breaking shit
Present day, all my people are gone
No real friends, just leeches around eating the crumbs
No family bonds, no FV, can't be with my son
No fucking girlfriend, I swear I thought that she was the one
I feel alone and I struggle to get my fans what they want from me
I'm struggling to build this UP company
I'm begging on my fucking knees like, ""God, please help me 'cause I can't fucking breathe
I'm tryna smile, but pain is cutting deep
Show me that I'm more than just a rapper
Show me that this life that I've been working on is meant to be more than just a disaster""
I hope this message I'm sending is floating up above
Instead of focusing on fame, I should've focused on the love

I don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't want it no more, I don't want it no more, no more
(No, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more
(No more)
No more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't want it no more (No more) I don't want it no more
(No more)
No more (No more) (No, no, no, no, no, no)

I gotta go find myself

Bad Manners Freestyle,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Uh, Hopsin, yo, check it

I've come to conclusion that life sucks
The only good that comes out of it is sticking my dick in nice butts
So if it's wetter than normal inside your wife's cunt
It’s my nut, I busted inside her that hasn’t dried up (Yuck!)
I'm such a contradiction, I hang with Dizzy Wright
And all he does is smoke so when I'm breathing all the ganja gets in
Not to mention I'm condescending, my mind is missing
Plus I'm kinda sending the wrong signal, oh god, I'm sickening
I'm not the one you wanna start shit with
I'm part animal, part dimwit with bad manners like Bart Simpson
You Hollywood niggas who write songs
I'll give you a black eye, that's a good reason to put some ice on
I'm like a Jedi with the Obi-Wan bars
Lyrics are shocking just like a phoney gun charge
My niggas we only fuck with the dopey blonde broads
We play 'em, and trade 'em like they were Pokemon cards
I excel in rap, it's 'cause I been through fucking hell and back
You ain't close to dope, it's just that everybody else is wack
Niggas getting jealous tryna diss me, scary!
I'm an animal, fuck a Mink coat, bitch wear me!
Yo, all you rappers quit your bitching and sit and listen
I'm the new sick edition of Pac, this is the demolition
I'm so tired of all the reminiscing
So I'ma leave these niggas shook like my dick when I finish pissing
(Yo, you fucking nasty dog) Get off me
I love Christ, but guarantee you wouldn't wanna cross me
I'm as frustrating as lost keys
My sick mind's a good example of what the crooked law breeds
I'm trying to die as the greatest rapper
Shit, I'm so hungry I could stick my fist in a blender and drink it after
You climbing up then I'ma break the ladder
And you'll fall off so damn hard that every bone in your face will shatter
Fuck these niggas, I'm a racist bastard
You hear the devil speaking in tongues on this song if you replay it backwards
Tell your sister I can't wait to smash her
But I heard that her pussy stinks so make sure that she fucking takes a bath first
I come second to none
My verbal weapon is perpetuous, and it's just as effective as guns
You destined to plunge, homie, I find it pleasant and fun
Like having sex with a nun (What the heck have ya done!?)
Whoa, I'm known to hate, I use foul language to motivate
I know I'm dope, okay, but Hop ain't real was just a role I play
Earth, I don't know this place, but I just wanna stroll away
Into my home in space wearing a pair of flying rollerblades

Pans in the Kitchen,Gazing at the Moonlight,2009.0,"Stop and listen
I'll rock it wicked, no competition on the shit
You gotta get it, there's nothing hotter than it
A whack rapper's what Hopsin isn't, I'll kick it
To ya if you got a minute you'll bob ya'head like a walking pigeon
Quit my position, I'm kinda different when rhymes is kickin'
I got lots of this, I vibe to it as I rock a fitted
The amount of people that's feeling me is a high percentage
They know I'm tight, but I'll be conceited if I admit it
I'ma con the game until I'm up at the top of it
And don't be chicken to call me out if you got a problem with it
Un-silenced shit is gon' get you stuck in some violent shit
And feelings will be hurt so you're better off if you mind your business
Don't get it started, with that nigga Marcus, that kid retarded
It's gon' evolve to some ruckus, he'll prove your shit is garbage
He'll be the illest artist, realist on this rap
All you niggas out there wanna get him on your tracks

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
I like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama
You gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama
Don't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama
I'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama!

I used to push weight on the block
A fat bitch, she was barely able to walk
She was good for one thing, that was taking a cock
Till she told me she was pregnant, shit I'm thankful to God
That she wasn't, 'cause all that shit was making me hot
I'm happy that she ain't the one to have a baby with Hop
She's so obese, I'd take her out and make her stay in the car
Her body odour always smelling like some bacon and farts
I'd tell her how I don't eat pork, she took it straight to the heart
Ready to make an assault, she need to make her fucking way to the barn
Cause that's where she belong, better leave me alone
Calling, asking where I'm at like she need to know
Oh what a surprise, she thinking I'm the love of her life?
Becoming my wife?
Bitch, take some fucking advice
You wanna look nice? Trust me I'm right
Go to the motherfucking gym and lose the gut and you're fine

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
I like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama
You gon' let me play with the pans in the kitchen mama
Don't care what you say about the pans in the kitchen mama
I'ma prove that I'm the man in the kitchen mama!

I'm Marcus and yes I am stupid
Thought I was a smart kid? Guess again, stupid
I'm a Special Ed student
Give me a couple of bars and let the man prove it
'Cause there's evidence to it
I never knew it, but the rest of my class knew it
They must've thought I'd never remember the past to it
Fuck school, man, I never could pass through it
I never be that student that headed to class who gets an A
Up on his report card, a nice kid who's so smart
Seem like when they threw me in Special Ed It got more hard
Every year the cycle repeats over again
My friends graduate and I'm way older then them
Then they come to me, nice mugging me, making fun of me
What do these ugly motherfuckers be thinking when they fuck with me?
They lucky I don't suddenly go and become something other than me
Like a fucking psycho, then what's it gonna be?

Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
Mama keep the pots and pans in the kitchen
I be banging on the pans in the kitchen
So mama don't be trying to hide the pans in the kitchen
I like playing with the pans in the kitchen mama

Here, let me read you her bio (go 'head)
She was raised in Cleveland, Ohio (Uh huh)
Got a tattoo of a cross on her left tit
Yo, but, she don't believe in no bible (what?)
She flashing niggas when I'm on stage
She let anyone see 'em at my show (you're kidding)
First time I met her was at a meet and greet
She ran up in a hurry and was like ""woah""
""Hi Hop, I'm Ramona (hi)
Please forgive me, I might go nuts
I don't know but I'm like so lucky
And I just wish I could just...oh fuck
I'm nervous and I feel worthless
Please don't think I'm doing this on purpose
I just cannot control all my urges
You're just...oh my God you're so perfect""
Man if you fuck with this bitch then you're doomed (yup)
She followed me and my tour crew
To my hotel, I'm like ""who you?
Where you going?"" she said ""your room"" (silly)
Like ""woah look, ho you gotta go, just because I ripped the mic
Don't mean you get the right to follow me back to my hotel room, you ain't 'bout to spent the night, aight?""
She said ""okay, Marcus, what if I give you my pussy (what?)
Oh my God, getting fucked by Hopsin, do you know how awesome that would be? Ah""

She became friends with my girlfriend but my girlfriend did not know (know what?)
That Ramona's obsessed with me, she been to at least ten of my shows, woah
Fucking all my niggas names up she like ""Gerald Benton, he wrecks it
Disney Wright, weed repping, I love SwisSs, three S's""
I'm like ""God damn bitch, You ain't even got no chance bitch
You ain't even my real fan bitch, you only know 'Sag my Pants' bitch""
All over my Instagram pics, tryna get my attention
Hoping I'mma get you a ticket and fly you to Cali and put you in a bed you can ride the dick in (hell no ho)
I can't lie though, her ass fat
She send me nudes up on Snapchat
I know every nigga done tapped that
She gets sad 'cause I do not snap back (hahaha)
That nasty girl, I ain't touching her (nope)
Fuck her, I don't fuck with her (nuh uh)
She a real rap chasing hustler
If you see her ass, hit the slut alert
This one time she tried to cut....
(Oh my God, Hopsin) what the fuck (hey)

(I love you so much) shut your ass up, get your ass out

Yo Hopsin (what up man?), you know that bitch named Ramona? (yeah)

I swear to God Hop, man, it's been sick
She be like ""Jarren, oh my God, you're the shit
I'll never, ever, ever, ever brush my teeth now that my breath smells just like your dick""
Yuck, she won't leave me alone
Every five seconds, bitch blowing up my phone
I'm paranoid hoping she don't show up at my home
What the fuck was I on? Pills or Patron
Then the bitch talking 'bout she's knocked up
How bitch, damn, I had my cock locked up
With a latex condom, and we just fucked two days ago
Now how the fuck a baby pop up?
Ah, she like ""Jarren you're right, must be SwizZz or maybe Dizzy Wright
Cause he went inside it raw like, just the other night""
Swear to God Hop, we gotta take this whores life
But damn, who gon' let Kato know?
That's the nigga's girlfriend, he don't know that she a hoe
Now she on DJ Hoppa's dick like ""go DJ, go DJ, go""
Go DJ, go DJ, go

I am not one of your fucking groupies Hopsin
And honestly, you just lost a fucking fan, okay?
I told all my friends about your music
And now I regret it, and Jarren, you're a fucking liar
I only know you because of fucking Hopsin, okay?
And I genuinely thought you were a nice fucking guy
So I sucked your dick, and you made fun of me
You made fun of me for sucking your fucking cock
I so can't live with myself right now

What’s My Purpose,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Planet Earth
The place that I live... we live
Who owns it?
You?
Nah, nobody owns this shit
Just a big ass piece of rock with humans on it
Do what the fuck I wanna do

A lost human born into a dark society
With one mind state, there's no variety
Movin' vibrantly, tryin' to be the best that I can be
I've tried to see the light in livin' life but it just blinded me... irony
Now I'm thinkin' violently, because I feel my country went and lied to me
It's bringin' out a whole new fuckin' side to me
Ride with me, if you feel my pain then you can cry with me
This fuckin' shady system is the rivalry
They the ones who raised us, turned us into cage nuts
They're what we're afraid of, they are why we ain't us
They the reason we constantly livin' for money and we just can't budge
It's takin' a toll on your dreams, so you gave up
And now the pain stuck, they ain't showin' nothin' but fake love
We just numbers put on a pay stub
Our purpose shouldn't be to make bucks
We all slaves and if we never make a change then we straight fucked

I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'

Who set the standard for everybody to live by?
How far along in life would you be if you did try?
Who tryna help these ghetto neighborhoods where kids die?
This world has turned into a mother fuckin' pigsty
I look outside and it disgusts me, it bugs me
It's ugly, I trust no other fuckin' human but me
So what needs, to be done? Every day is a rerun
Technology's advanced, as people how far have we come?
Yeah, I can see that time's grown, but still I'm mind blown
'Cause everybody's mind is stuck inside they iPhone
They always textin' and postin' statuses hourly
But in reality, there's no sign of a personality
It's cowardly, we shielded like we scared to get some allergies
The human being is what we don't know how to be
And honestly these issues really suck to know
But I refuse to sit and let the trouble grow, so God, show me where the fuck to go

I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'

How can a man with power feel there's no responsibility?
These rappers blowin' up, but through my eyes they not as real to me
They constantly conceal the beast, but never try to heal the streets
Teachin' girls to be a slut, but never make 'em feel unique
How can we feel fine this way? Open up your minds today
The matrix got you young, owin' a debt you'll spend your life to pay
Stressed out, assumin' that you'll be more happy inside your grave
Don't tell me about no fuckin' struggle then, nigga, 'cause I know pain
To the point where I felt like life was shit
Growin' up as a kid with both parents who got no funds to ever provide you with
Shit is just stuck repeatin', the world is tough to be in
Munchin' on fast food, don't even know what the fuck I'm eatin'
America, I gave it my all
Still you guys arrested me for bein' black and standin' on a sidewalk
It doesn't matter if I'm breakin' laws or bein' harmless
I'm automatically hated by cops 'cause my dark skin
God was my smartest option
My soul is mine, y'all ain't gonna bargain off it
'Cause if you do that means the darkness profits
The sky is where I got my heart adopted
Man, if we all just took the time to think I swear it won't be hard to stop this
But y'all assume that I'm just startin' nonsense
But I promise y'all the fuckin' world is gon' remember Marcus Hopson
There's consequences for enlightenment
But if I have to hide the truth to live then I'mma die just like my idols did

I can't stand humans, I hate humans, but I'm a human
(I'm only human)
One monkey eats shit, now all the other monkeys wanna do it, humans are so stupid
Don't bring your bull shit around me (Fuckin' human)
The problem is killin' my mind, God, give me a sign
Maybe I'm trippin', tell me this life is worth livin'",https://genius.com/Hopsin-whats-my-purpose-lyrics

Ankle wrapped up a while back, a nigga bruised it
Who's this? fresh ass nigga with the steelo
A vicious ego, he hardly ever land in primo
He always got a brand new deck wherever he go
Flexin' on niggas at the park like Debo
He keep the hot spots on the d-low
If he snap a board DGK'll hook him up with the reload
Never get it mixed up, I'm the one with big nuts
Hitting everything regular, because my switch sucks
Play SK8 you'll get fucked, see I likes to kick butt
Hole in my shoe cause that's the spot where all my grip rubs
I'm in the valley with a bunch of street vandals
We maneuver boards with a clean handle like Kareem Campbell
Soon I'll be rolling through your neighborhood probably

Saw a handrail and figured I could bust on it
Tried to boardslide and hit my fucking nuts on it

Bout to pass out, man I'm only skating flat ground
Some days I feel like I suck and never try stuff
Until I watch a skate video and get hyped up

If you witness one you'll probably throw your board away and just go home instead
Blazing up the hubba on this skating little suckers
They ain't brave enough so they say I'm a crazy motherfucker
Yes, best believe I'm that raw, you don't have to ask dog
I been doing this since you were semen in your dad's balls
So much pop you would think I'm bout to blast off
So fucking high when I land I crack the asphalt
G'd up shoes the color of cherry kool-aid
Hat back, with no belt in my pants, just a shoe lace
Skating legends mean mugging yo, when will these niggas learn?
It's been 10 minutes and I still can't seem to get a turn

The true satisfaction held within mankind lies in blood!

You don't wanna get ya head cracked?
When you see me coming through you, better step back
I be crumpling all you niggas leaving you stuck up in the gutter with ya neck and your body ready to shed that (blood)
I'm a beast in the night
Creepin' up on you to feast on your life
The demons inside
Are telling me to give you a reason to cry
And leave you to lie in (blood)

Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood

You don't really wanna roam in the darkness (no)
You ain't ready for the pain and the harshness (no)
I'm zoning up to hop outside of my ride, at full speed, then swerve till the car flips (blood)
You dealin' with a maniac
See I know a couple of ways to scrap
I'mma raise the axe
Throw it at you while you're running away and when it hits, your brains will splat
So just face the facts
I'm a result of all the gangsta rap
I say shit, never take it back
I don't hate to brag
A true menace with a love of blood
You'll never get rid of my ways
What you think of that, huh? (blood)

Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood

Give me your blood

Beat niggas till they have concussions (woah)
Rape wives and then laugh at husbands (woah)
And if you down with the mass destruction (what)
Toast to it with a glass of blood then (blood)
Pray to God for a night to start
I'm a psycho nigga finna top the charts
Being shot with darts till it stops your heart
And chopped apart and thrown up in a shopping cart
And pushed off a cliff, there's no alternate
Ending that involved with this, it's your fault I'm pissed
You're gonna suffer the consequences
You can not prevent this shit, I promise it, come on (blood)
Pretty clear that my brain's not there
I be looking for it when I shave my hair
Black is the color that I paint my lair
And the way I break niggas everyday is not fair
It's all because of the rage I bare
See I'm down for whatever, just say ""I dare""
My nut sack is the biggest so you niggas gonna have to murder me if you wanna take my pair (blood)

Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
I want your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Give me your blood

You don't like me? Tune it out
I'm livin' life on the foolish route
When I hit the kitchen, I butcher niggas until they drain slowly, but only when the moon is out
I get this way when my mood is down
Some even think that I'm rude and foul
Out of all the lovely children my mother gave birth to, I was the stupid child (blood)
Back in the day, when I was in elementary, I would chisel a pencil until it sharp as fuck
Leavin' the bullies laid out, on the playground
When they came round, yell ""fuck"" if you're raw as nuts, come on (fuck)
The sight of blood is so marvellous, stab a nigga in his stomach till you scar the gut
Hit 'em in the spine until you paralyze him and fill him with lighter fluid and go ahead and spark him up
And then abracadabra, am I missing brain cells? That doesn't matter
Makin' you scream makes me a happier rapper
You don't want trouble then your ass better back up
Fast little bastard (blood)
I was born as a natural hazard, I turn lives into massive disasters
Look over your shoulder when I'm in the area
You might get hit in the cranium with the back of a hammer (blood)

Now see, I got a strange urge
And I feel like creepin' up on a stranger
I want your blood

I'mma probably get popped by Biggie and Pac's killer
Look at my pock's fill up, now I'm a twat driller
I remember the days when bitches would not pick up
The phone when I would call them, now hoes is not a problem
I rose up from the bottom, ""Hey bro, you're fucking awesome!""
But I ain't here to brag about a new Porsche with two doors
You made a killing now I'm about to bring a few more
It's time you feel my true force, from Cali straight to New York
Y'all gon' kiss my ass like you tried to make me do yours, bitch
You want a active beef? Think before attacking me
I know I'm quick to get outta line like I have to pee
It's obvious that I got your heart thumping
I may look like a fucking idiot, but I promise I'm far from it

A year ago I wasn't all that

I talk shit and whip beats, I'm a true MC
Only one who tells me what to do is me

Hoppa, Dizzy, me and three Z has made the group complete
My shit is past basic, in my eyes I feel I have made it
Came a long way from my mom and dad's basement
When I do shows now the women strip me half naked
My motherfucking bad language got my ass famous
Now labels thinking about signing me (yes)
MTV has got they eye on me (yes)
Skubbedy dubbedy wow, this is irony
I still ain't giving a fuck
So if I hurt your feelings tell it to your diary
Nigga, I'm so beast, rhyming over cold beats
Finally shining without the diamonds and gold teeth
The higher empire tryna bring fire in on me

I ain't trippin', just listen, I'm on a discrete mission
Rappers speaking on drugs, money and deceive women for a check
While they boss grillin', sittin' in their seat spinnin'
That's like the foulest crime
Somewhere down the line I was bound to rise
To make a difference, and now it's time
I know you rappers is about a dime
But it’s hard for me to live when you corrupting minds I’m surrounded by
I ain't the nigga you go outshine
Truth is, you only go in when I'm coming outside
Fuck your road, turning down mine
When you greet me get on your knees and open your mouth wide
For the record I ain't the type to share
If you a rapper tainting my image, then war is what I might declare
Just cause I'm buzzing off the white contacts
Don't mean you should take your ass to Hot Topic to buy a pair

Now all off a sudden bitches all on my ballsack

You couldn't bust with a dick full of sperm cells

My hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh huh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time
RIGHT NOW!

You see I'm lyrically bashin' up on your feelings
I'm bad and I don't conceal it, this dragon is known for killin'
That's the reason I'm baggin' these hoes and grillin'
My madness is so appealin' and swagger is on a billion
Aside from all the provocative hellishness
I'm somewhat underground, but got the commercial elements
According to ruthless records it wasn't evident
So I'm a 9/11 the label bitches to hell with it
I'm that crazy nigga, you can't be iller
I'll pick ya fuckin' mom up in a 18-wheeler
Yeah I'll hit it, but if she don't wanna pay me scrilla
I'll let a rottweiler fuck her till the rabies kill her
My hobbies are rappin' vicious, slappin' bitches
Grabbin' digits, and I occasionally laugh at midgets
I'm hardly sane and half horrific with a dab of mischief
Never rap no shit if I haven't lived it, it's that specific

My hot 16's be on that ill shit! (uh huh)
Your hot 16's deal with the children (uh huh)
Baby, Hopsin is in the building! (you know) We gone have one hell of a time
RIGHT NOW!

I’m Not Introducing You,Raw,2010.0,"A lot of you females got me twisted
You assume just because I'm a rapper, you can approach me in a ho-ish way and get something out of it
Shit, you'd be lucky if you walk away with an autograph, bitch
You better come correct

I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one
And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land

I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama
I'm not introducing you to mama

Man it's so hard to find a girl who's close to having a mindstate like me
A lot of you drink and smoke, suck a lot of dick on the low and probably got HIV
Don't get mad when you get played by me I'ma keep it real til the day I D-I-E
And for you girls who be up in the club that's underage with a fake ID

So stupid now you're crying your eyes out he's long gone and you're trying to find out
But I'm telling you why so don't cry baby girl now it's time for you to be back on the right route
Back to me, actually, I got a lot of girls throwing they ass to me
I throw it right back at 'em so happily, can't believe that they have the audacity
To even do that shit, like I'm that guy
Bitch come down 'cause you're not that fly
Kiss the first night, it's not that time. No hoes hopping inside my ride

Every girl I meet, always talking bout ""I don't even wanna know Hopsin, ew
Yeah, he got some skills but every time he put them eyes in it look like he popped some pills
I just wanna know Marcus, he's a sweet little innocent boy
Oh god I'd date him with no prob
And if he wanted to I'll let him beat the pussy with no condom""
Bitch, what's your problem? You expect me to be optim -mistic, for the mischief you bring your senseless bitch you out of
Your mind I know you like the fact I'm so bad when I spit up on the track
Black and I rap with a little bit of swag and happen to have a little money in the back
What the fuck do you got that'll impress me so I can feel half of the magic?
A loose vaginal passage, uh uh bitch put that back in the package
I feel so sick and lonely, I want a real girl that will get to know me
No charcoal breath who be hitting a stogie and not one that'll say shit to blow me

I'm a beam just like the shining sun

And I'd be the water that's raining down on the land

I like nature, ah you too? Wow, we got so much in common boo
Don't be assuming that I'm going to love you because if you do I'll cut you out of my life I promise you
I'm down to earth and I'm an honest dude
You barely be giving me any homage dues
I would definitely regret it and probably get a big headache if I was stupid and got with you
How many guys have you let bone you? (Uhhh?) Let me guess, you don't have no clue huh?
Could've been 5, could have been 10, could have been a million nigga's that hopped on you huh?
I ain't trying to be another one on the list, that'll make me a true son of a bitch
Yup I know how you work, you ain't nothing but a flirt baby girl that's one of the risks
Best believe that I'ma pass on that, ain't got time for no asshole acts
You say you a good girl that's no fact, can't roll smooth 'cause your axles cracked
You can't find a good man that's so sad, I think it's because you act so wack
So don't be trying to blame the world for your nonsense bitch I'll fuck around a smack yo ass

I'm a beam just like the shining sun
But I'd be a fool if I say you're the one

Covid Mansion,UnKnown,2020.0,"Right now, I'm in Thailand
Quarantined, it's a foreign scene
Can't go to the airport and leave
And I thought my old life was boring, geez
'Scuse me, I'm 'bout to bang my forehead on the floor and scream
The dude I'm staying with's annoying
How much fucking torture can boredom be?
Take my ass to the morgue in peace! (Look bitch)

It's 2020, I was preparing some new bombs
And making sure that my competition gon' put a noose on (Woo)
My aggression ain't really a subtle nuance
I been in the game ten years, how can I do wrong? (Hey)
Who's on what I'm on? I'm savage as usual
I'm back in the booth, I have rappers to poop on (Yeah)
Now there just ain't many plans I can move on
All because someone ate bat soup in Wuhan (What?)
Well shit, that's what I heard
I don't know what it was mixed with (I don't know)
But for someone to jeopardize everyone's life
Man, it must have been fucking delicious (For real)
This shit is fucking ridiculous
Can't be with my son or my siblings, the government trippin'
My pussy appointments with dozens of bitches are cancelled
Now guess what I'm tuggin' my dick with? (What?)
""My right hand"", (Ooh)
When I get a tingle inside of my penis, I'm like, ""Hi, my friend"" (Hi)
And you know the lotion is sitting on, ""My nightstand"" (Hey)
And when I finish my business, I go to ""Ni-night land""
And now I gotta take a weapon gettin' groceries (Yeah)
Hopefully motherfuckers know to back away forty feet
Don't be jokingly mingling if you happen to notice me (No)
I ain't fuckin' with none of you niggas 'til the 'Rona leave (Ugh)

Get back (Hey)
Move back, step back
Y'all better not touch me, ayy
Get back (Come on)
Move back, step back
Y'all better not touch me (Ugh)
I done been told y'all niggas, back up (Move)
You don't wanna see me call backup (No)
So get back (Hey)
Move back, step back
Y'all better not touch me

We all at home, we campin' out (Fuck this)
I notice everybody made a TikTok, oh, we dancin' now (Yah)
And I see about four, five, six hundred new hoes made a OnlyFans account
Get your money girl, better get your dough (Yeah, flash them titties one time)
This ain't funny girl, you finna be broke (You don't wanna be a broke bitch)
Somebody told me it was the 5G towers
And everybody's immunity spiraling downward
And if it's true, fight the power, the time is now
I gotta divide the crowd from the mindless cowards
I know y'all love when I recite some foul words
Especially during the COVID-19 outburst
And I got nothing better to do
Evidence proves, I been spending hours live on IG, wowzers
Wait, hold up, wait, that's strange
I sent a text, why you ignoring me? (You ignoring me)
Hmm, I know you got time to reply
Bitch, don't even lie, 'cause you in the quarantine
Yeah, I know how you do (Yeah)
You with your boo (Yeah)
You treatin' my feelings so morbidly
After this song drop, bitch, I'm blocking you
Don't be surprised when you text and it's going green (Ha!)
How do we deal with a worldwide corruption?
I don't know if the media is hyping up shit
Look at the situation our life is stuck in
I got no toilet paper to wipe my butt with (Ugh)
Whoever did this is on Hopsin's shit list
God forbid, the world get's apocalyptic
Well it is soon, look at all the odds against it
So don't touch me without my permission (Ugh)

Get back (Hey)
Move back, step back
Y'all better not touch me, ayy
Get back (Come on)
Move back, step back
Y'all better not touch me (Ugh)
I done been told y'all niggas, back up (Move)

I Am Raw,Raw,2010.0,"You motherfuckers are quick to judge. It's all good though. You don't know shit about shit. If you only knew what I knew, if you only knew what I could do. If you could only see what I could see you would probably stop bothering me

Yeah
I independently started this shit, marketing hits
Starving for chips, no gasoline to start off the whip
Felt like the only nigga labels wasn't bargaining with
My heart has been ripped, I stuck with it as hard as it gets
These producers would always blow me off
Now that I'm blowing up, they don't recall
Talking about ""Yo, you my homie, dawg"" (My nigga)
Oh, now you wanna hop on the Hop train
Knowing damn well since '04 I had hot flames (The fuck outta here)
My real buddies was mainly the worst
Hating to shoot my videos without me paying them first
So I slide 'em 100 bucks to watch 'em bitch on how it ain't enough (Man)
That money got my cell, internet and cable cut!
A real homie would've gave a fuck and not expect to pay upfront
Then get the money later when I'm making some
Nobody saw the bigger picture except me
They neglect me, only thing that protects me is FV (Come on)

You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw

I was a high school grad preparing to go to college
An enthusiastic freshman, major in Economics
I didn't have a clue what to expect to be honest
Banging beats in my dorm, streaming Pornhub constant
I figured I could make it out in four years tops
Study religiously and graduate, apply for a job
The rap thing was secondary, I was putting it off
Calling it quits, assuming I had better chances playing ball (Yep)
My third year came and suddenly that changed
I couldn't bear watching my mom at home suffering pain
Tryna fight off the strain of only having half a stomach
Plus a handicap back from a surgery that helped nothing!
So I returned to the valley and called the homie
Hop was on Ruthless getting shelved like a trophy
I told him how I left my life in the OC
And we concluded that we could both use FV

You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone
Bitch I am raw

This was written for niggas who wouldn't give me dap
Niggas who told me that I had sissy rap
This was written for all the bitches I used to called who never hit me back
Until they heard the word I was buzzing, c'mon don't give me that (Shit)
You backed out, now you tryna roll with my clique?
Where the fuck were you when my signing bonus was spent?
Where the fuck were you when I got the notice for rent
Saying I was getting evicted and I was hopeless as shit?
See I keep some names handy and you got thrown on the list
That's how you know that I'm pissed, I got you, don't even trip
'Cause I'm rude over the nicest beats, you had to go ignite the heat
You might agree to beef, but yo I'm not the type you'd like to meet
Life's indeed a journey that I have yet to finish
Hopefully my career's something that will be epidemic
You'll always know that it's Hopsin the way I wreck a sentence
Realness, I represent it, raw, I'm the definition

You don't always have to stick by my side
Just make sure you remember me when I die
I am raw, I am raw
Just to let you niggas know
Bitch I am raw, I am raw
Don't forget me when I'm gone

A bunch of savages
, Hop'll slice the head off a faggot
I wake up in the morning and go raid the medicine cabinet
Every word I spit is murder on the page of this tablet
I spit out a fucking bullet from this gauge at your fabric
I'm not your average Joe, brain pattern is slow
A lot of pain, things changed, now I'm stacking this dope
Exclusive new shit, me and Hopsin we too sick
I crack a hater upside his fucking head with a pool stick
Murdering me is like Hop signing to Ruthless
For a second time and 
then pigs flying on broomsticks
Michael Jackson crawling out of his grave with two kids
Bitches squirting St. Ides liquor out of they two tits
Fuck a metaphor, basically nigga you ain't doing it
Hand you a mirror before I murk you, check out a view in it
I'm losing it, serial killer lurking the music biz
Without a mask, I want you bitches to know who the fuck it is
Suffering succotash, rims on a hovercraft
Romantic psychopath, I drown whores in a bubble bath
It's Mr. Benton nigga, y'all fall back

Nah, I'm in a rush to put the pressure on
Let it be known, ask yo girlfriend who she sextin' on
Better known, 
It's Mister Knock-Knock the panties down
You a hand-me down, Hammer down what they invested on
Shoulda' left it alone, Shouldn't have left her at home
It gets her off of you, I'm watchin' as she testin' it on
My marijuana scent all up in yo shit
You ain't shit, You as solid as my spit
I gotta couple rappers on my list
Better get established before I get to wrapping up careers
King Dizzy coming to give it to you straight

Just in a room of rotten rappers, gruesome bodies I’m killin' like I’m illuminati
I’m fuckin' out the blue tsunami, nothin' you can do to stop me
I don’t care if you knew karate or do pilates
You fools are probably scattered so gather you stupid posse
And get me before 
I move to Aussie and they crucify me
Fuck your new Versace, you can get a cutthroat and deep-throat a dick till it’s poking out through your butthole
Swallow the nut whole, this shit is X-rated
Y'all kept playin’ on devilish ground till you met Satan
I stomp on you till you chest cave in and neck breaking
You better be keepin’ you mouth shut like your breath stinkin'
There really isn't anyway I can be less blatant
So face it, you basically fucked, my brain is corrupt
This little bar — I’m raising it up
And you can watch me catapult after you finish licking Jarren’s anus and nuts

""Um, there's something I wanted to ask you""
""Uh, what is it?"" 
""Um, could you do me a favor?
Oh no, no, no!

Marcus?
 What? 
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
 Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty?
 Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty?
 Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please?
 No! 
Please?
 No!

Hold up, throw me the mic, I got a flow to recite
You got a baby by a nigga that you don't even like
A broke nigga who thuggish, always be talkin' rubbish
Steady be causing ruckus, all because you were sluttish
Jesus, I can't believe this, freak shit!
That's the same motherfucker that you had cheated on me with!
 (What?!)
I knew this would happen without a question
But you said, ""I never have sex without protection""
Bitch please, you left me flowing down shits creek
You sex driven like a big freak
Plus our relationship has been breached, you took a big leap
And rumor has it you sucked his dick then kissed me
And now I'm s'pose to be the father and the mental guide
Like, ""Sure, I'll take care of the little guy""
Shit, you ain't puttin' me through the stress
I put your baby in a pillow case and beat it to death, bitch

Marcus?
 What? 
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
 Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty?

Would you still be down to get nasty?
 Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please?
 No! 
Please?
 No!

I'm far from a fuckin' life saver
Not you're friendly neighbor, but yet you called me during your labor
It's not my issue, take me off the menu
I'm not the one who put the motherfucker in you
I'm not a mean guy, hate to sound that foul
But I don't give a fuck about that child (You damn right)
See you chose him, then he fucked you, tag, you’re it
Too bad his dick didn't have any insurance
You knew that he was just a lame nigga prior to it
Now your ass hittin' me up thinking I would do it
Hoping we gonna spark it off like some lighter fluid
That's kinda stupid, face the facts, bitch, your life is ruined
And don't be callin' me like, ""My life's a crazy blur
Rashad don't take care of the baby and makes me hurt
I wish that me and you could go back to the way we were""
Shit we can, just get rid of the baby first

Marcus?
 What? 
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
 Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty?
 Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty?
 Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows
Please?
 No! 
Please?
 No!

Now I won't be your baby's daddy, I'm not the one
But you can still give me some head and maybe swallow some cum
And if you want it, then I can deliver quite clean
But don't ever send the baby to find me

Yo
Do you remember when I told you I would love you forever
And broke up with my girlfriend Heather
Kicked her to the curb, and then I got with you thinkin' you were better
And found out you were a heart shredder
Yeah, I felt really stupid after that
Became the nigga that my crew was laughin' at, I was foolish, that's a fact
(Yup) So this is karma, you been on my shit list
So ha ha ha ha, that's what you get, bitch

Marcus?
 What? 
Will you be my baby daddy
And be the one to always make me happy?
 Ho, hell no!
Will you watch SpongeBob with him
And then teach him how to make a Krabby Patty?
 Ho, hell no!
Even though I got stretch marks
Would you still be down to get nasty?
 Ho, hell no!
Shit, I'm mad enough to throw elbows

I bite the barrel of a .38 til' I break teeth and sever the pistol
Crazy isn't the issue, I'm simply fucking deranged
Cut off half of your face and I let the rest of it hang
Niggas taking shots, you better adjust your aim
See I've been through some shit, I've just adjusted to pain
Maniac in a mink coat
I spit fire then I slam him off the rope like 
Ricky "" The Dragon "" Steamboat
I breathe life on this mic dude
I beat em' with the same cross the Jews nailed Christ to
It's obvious that I don't like you
I'll meet you after school at 2 o' clock to fight you
Cut my arm off and jerk off with my right foot
Smoke crack stay up all night and I write books
I'm tryna face fuck Ke$ha
You niggas got beef I'll bring the lettuce and ketchup
Alright Tim I fess up
I'm really not a human I'm eatin' you from the neck up
All that fuckin' hatin' you doing it don't affect us
You wake up with a grudge like MOM FUCK BREAKFAST!
Fuck you, her, him, and them
You feminine you gave a rimjob to Tim and Jim
You and the word fag is a synonym
Jarren signing out the nigga version of Eminem

It's pretty clear that I'm a bit different
I lost my mind in 09' and I still don't know what I did with it
Now I punch babies and kick midgets
I'll bust a glass bottle over your head after I piss in it
The game never showed no sympathy for Marcus
Fuck it I got a new remedy to start shit
Every wack rapper's now an enemy, a target
I'm gifted you flat out mentally retarded
Bitch I don't reason with fags, I'll uppercut you so hard the front row of all you teeth will collapse
Your jaw bone will get too weak and detach, I'll put you in a coma so long it'll take you 8 weeks to get back
I'm rockin' out on Tim West and I'm representing with my crew
I'm wack? Take a second listen to my tunes
You niggas better quit I advise you
You never go in like a non-erected dick in a dry cooch

Rappers get nervous when they see me in the picture
They know the consequences of me becoming that nigga
Funk Volume representa leaving niggas in a maze,
You can't get to Hop if I'm playing security at the gate
Uh, It's crazy cuz' I'm in and out The Veg
I see a lack of preparation, but I ain't giving out no breaks
I'm giving out these hands, so I'm letting you know in advance
If you try to step to the plate I'll let my lyrics break your face
I, went from Soul Searchin' to Smoke Out, now I'm overseas and these shows are still sold out
You should be ashamed if you thinkin' I'm bout' to hold out, I'm just coming from the city where I had to kick the do' down
Uh, a flat-top til' my hair is long, Try to clown and I'mma have to hang you with this herringbone
The south fuck with us cuz nigga we put Jarren on, Carry on, We just tryna get our money very long
Ya, and it's working quite nicely, get your wifey, too much time she might like me
The new version of DJ Quik in the 90's, my rhythmalism got these wack niggas tryna find me
It's crazy I went from nothing to something, said I was going global now I'm rapping out in London

Honestly I done got everything I ever wanted
But is it enough? (Is it enough?)
You're mad 'cause your fans ain't as loyal
Dropping classics again
Wrecking on you, damn it, man
Get the body bag there is too much madness at hand weightin' on you
K.O.-in' niggas with the blow
Suck my dick under the mistletoe
Don't forget the balls, lick 'em both
This is Sicko Mode level, Travis isn't getting on because

Bitch I am on ten, this ain't no
Game, I'm not your fan
You should know, Hop's back in here
Stay packin' heat, you runnin' shit, not actually
These niggas can't pull off
What I do up in this booth
I am too rude when I intrude on you, don't
Act like you never knew homie, I
Spent most of my life tryna get
Here, do not get near, you gon' feel
Fear in its worst form

Still Got Love for You,Knock Madness,2013.0,"You left me and you went home to Indianapolis
If I wanted, I'd be getting plenty of ass and tits
But I want you, can you send me an answer quick?
Lost in your love, baby, give me a map to this
Never knew what love felt like till I met you
My heart wasn't for any other woman except you
But you stabbed it till it bled through
And now my head screwed 'cause I shoulda been the one who had left you
Accepted our break up really wasn't that pleasant
But I learned to deal with it and didn't ask questions
No point in making the past present
But after a month and a half, you was a month and a half pregnant
Damn, my heart taken badly
Now I'm a situation dealing with another baby daddy
Sad part about it yo, it's not even my kid
Evidence proves you really out of your mind, bitch

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me

I'm in shock, life feeling like a crazy movie
I really don't appreciate the way you do me
Since I got your news I been dating groupies
But they never last, all they want is fame and jewelry
These gold-diggers can't recruit me
I keep running back to you as if the pain is soothing
'Cause the bond we had is something I got used to
My mind is telling me to say bye-bye, screw you
You ain't even in love with the guy you having a kid with
When I think about it I get sick, you did this
Clubbing with your friends and drinking till you get senseless
Shoulda thought about this shit before you sipped it
You put faith into his dick
And now you pregnant by a dipshit, life is all twisted
Our world could've been terrific
But the Hopsin bus passed baby, and you missed it

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me

Now ain't no reason to be smiling for
I'm always the type looking down on whores
And even though the goddamn child is yours
You know I still got your back on child support
'Cause we both know you don't make enough for day care
That shoulda been my baby, what the fuck, this ain't fair
Call if you need me that's fine by me
But the jealousy killing me 'cause that's not my seed
I don't know why I take this crap from you
Break my back for you, I can't adapt to you
We ain't compatible, face the facts, it's true
But when you lost why do I make a path for you?
I spent a long time working at making our love tighter
But you sipping Jägermeister, and having these one nighters
I'll never be able to trust you
My nigga Tecca Nina said it best, ""I love you, but fuck you""

Oh no no no, you played your games
And now we'll never be the same
See I love you, but I hate you
And I hate the fact I still love you
Yeah yeah, oh why, oh why

I swear I thought you was my lady (lady)
Now you having another niggas baby
It was supposed to be me and you
But after all that you put me through
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me
Baby, I still got love for you
You ain't no good, girl
You ain't no good for me",https://genius.com/Hopsin-still-got-love-for-you-lyrics
BUS that,UnKnown,2017.0,"I'm on the road right now
Back of the tour bus, chillin' (Kato on the track bih)
Just wanted to drop some shit
You know

Okay, a wise man told me
That niggas that you beef with will pro'ly be your best pals
(Is that right?) Got my ear to the streets
And I notice everybody dropping shit, I feel left out
(Is that right?) If you in it for the cheese
This is real trap music, yeah, you go be a dead mouse
(Is that right?) You on a oneway street
Either collide or turn it around, that'd be your best route
Listen, y'all need to stop with the dissing
No one pays attention, so quit with the chitchat
Listen, y'all niggas steadily fishing
You riding me hard and my girl want my dick back
Listen, these niggas play like it's cool
And then run their mouth soon as I'm leaving, why is that?
Listen, I've been touring off an album
I ain't even dropped, you pro'ly think I rigged that (Nice)
I'm the plate, nigga, you just the dish rack
The whole Ill Mind series, I done did that
Niggas double taking, getting whiplash
How you tryna school me when I skip class
Confrontation with you is just quick cash
What the fuck you gon' do when your ship crash?
I got the juice, don't get caught in the splish splash
We don't fit in together, we mitch match
I am the misfit that nobody likes
I am colder than ice, I will hold up your life
You bigging you up, you were so overhyped
You were no good with mics, you'll be gone overnight
I saw my window and I dove on it right
Plus the flow is precise, I'm just rolling the dice
You claim that you got the shit on lock
Thinking you safe, but homie, I done broken it twice
Alright

All around the fucking planet
Niggas on my shit, dog
West side, east side, north side, south side
Bitches on my dick, dog
Snatch yo' freak, I'm that nigga
Cash on fleek, I'm that nigga

As for me, I'm that nigga

Look, got a brand new chick
She a law student working real hard out in Cape Town
(Cape Town, Cape Town) I became ill
When I hit the beat raw, it was ass up, facedown
(Facedown, facedown) Homie, you ain't shit
You tryna shine, I'ma turn your sunlight into a gray cloud
(Rain, rain) Had to hit you with a new flow
Saying that I sound like Slim Shady during 8 Mile
You signed your life away to record labels
While I'm signing big ol' voluptuous titties
I run through the city, the ladies are comfortable with me
They're wet and I want to go swimming
A wonderful feeling (Woo)
I strike that pussy like a thunderbolt hitting (Woo, woo)
Ladies say ""Oh my God, papi
It's all in my hair now, your cum is so sticky"" (Yikes)
Am I a sellout or prodigy?
Word on the street is the question is suss
(Suss) Niggas threw dirt on my name
It's ironic that they just got left in the dust
(The dust) You got your head in the clouds?
I am convinced that your head is just stuck
Hmm, don't make me go through my files
And pull all of your dirty evidence up (Oh no)
Niggas it's been on, my pen strong
If one shot fires I'm Kim Jong, so bitch, run
I sent bombs like ISIS from Islam
You drenched on with a light mist of piss, son
Who you know could get it like this? There is none
Rip your limbs, gone from a sick collision
See my nuts hang low, you can't miss the big ones
I'm coming, nigga, here, tell your chick to sip some

All around the fucking planet

I Can’t Decide,Raw,2010.0,"In the land of the killerz
You better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide

Now see, Tyrone does whatever his homies do
Just a dopey dude
An' deep in his mind, he knows he's cool
He's ditchin' class 'cause he feels like he don't belong in school
Momma always yellin' out ""Damn Tyrone, what's wrong with you!?""
He wanna show the world he grew in some balls
Abusing the law, 8 weeks in juvenile hall
This dude is the cause of a lot of shit
Don't know where is father went
Never had no confidence, resortin' to poppin' clips
His homies thought that they were violent assassins
They said ""Come on, Tyrone it's time to get active
We gon' roll up on this nigga
Real silent and passive
Then you pull out the 9 and then blast him
We gon' roll to his crib
Be careful shootin' so you don't hit the kids
You down fo' it?""
Tyrone said ""You know what it is""
So they roll up, about to retaliate on this busta
""POP POP"" (Bitch ass muthafucka)

Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up

Tyrones big ballin’, gettin' the dough
Fuck bitches and hoes, still rippin' the 4’s
Walk with his fist clinched he was itching to blow
Shit, and all the local neighborhood niggas would know
It's like he was born to fit the streets
Never had no chicken feet
Walked up to the local liquor store to get a swisher sweet
Before he walked in some dudes was like
“Aye Nigga...POP POP POP, we don't play nigga”
They just shot him when his lives undone
The man inside the liquor store dialed 911
And at the same time he's strugglin' tryin' to find someone
Screamin' “HELP HELP, STAY ALIVE YOUNG SON!”
The boys gonna die and he knows that
A bullet went through his skull cap
He’s barely breathing
And both of his eyes balls have rolled back
Oh crap the people who witnessed it can't believe it yo
Maybe it’s linked to the drive by he did a week ago

In the land of the killerz
You better say your prayers tonight
Amen, it's hard enough trynna survive
And to top it off I gotta watch my back
'Cause these niggas wanna act up
Should I fight or should I run?
Should I hide or get my gun?
I can't decide

Tyrone’s dead, all over some dumb shit
His homies don't know who did it
They just got assumptions
Ready to wild out
With a sinister function
And drive by on some bitch niggas and dump clips
And OG was like “fuck it he’s dead now
So open up the 40 and take a sip and pour the rest out
Y'all got me stressed now
Shit y'all need to chill out
'Cause every time some shit be poppin' off y'all pull the steel out”
One of the younger homies was like
“Fuck that, we gon’ tug gats and bust back, trust that”
The OG was like
“Man Y'all don’t need to be out here bustin' slugs
Y'all don't even know who the fuck it was
Y'all fucking bugs
Y'all gonna be dead taking this violent route
You little niggas always wildin' out
You need to getcha shit straight and understand whatcha life about
'Cause if a bullet hit your ass believe your lights is out”
The younger homie like “Nigga, you don't run these streets
You ain't never been no fucking G
If I wanna bust my heat it’s up to me
And I know them niggas that killed T
Are the same niggas that we hit up the other week”
Another homie like “Naaah they ain't get back for that
'Cause that’s them niggas pulling up in the Cadilla-
POP POP POP POP....POP

Battlefield and we killers so don't run through
Man there isn't much hope ya can hold onto
I'm up in the mix like pulp orange juice
Nigga you cannot walk in my sewn-on shoes
You thought I was quittin', the joke's on you
(Nigga laugh out loud)
Got the crown, I can't pass mine down
Demons in me, can't cast mine out
Nope
You can't forget me with the slashed eyebrows
Please excuse me when I'm at my prows
You might get trampled
The day'll never come up when I get handled
When the fire's lit then don't bite the candle
Your future's dim, I've got psychic channeling
And you know this man

this territory is vulture land
Y'all say he ain't shit until he became rich and bitch niggas,

Sure that it's obvious now

As of lately, I've been itching to smash

Time to myself was the best suggestion
Sex before bed and sex for breakfast
The sound that you're hearin' is the stress digested
You ever tell me, a little less aggression
You'd better get ghost 'fore your head get pressed in (back up)
You rap niggas just a facade
You only do ten-percent of your job
Your producer is the only reason that they bumpin' your shit while they sit up and nod
Who the fuck you think you kiddin' bro?
You think you're fly because you gettin' dough?
If your label would stop paying radio stations to play you
You think we would feel it? No
That's just how it goes
Please do not get close, this is not a joke
Better be jottin' notes of my hottest quotes
Till your pockets swole, 
puto vámonos (ay wey!)
Shit I'm just talkin', don't mind me
I guess it's my comical mind state
The moment I came into the game
I've been gettin' fame

I ain't even gotta try to amaze ya
Mind been missing
 
like a flight from Malaysia
That I can do when it lies in my nature

I ride alone through the night as I flow my pain
Now the whole world know my name
A whole lot changed, I'm givin' everybody mo' octane
And you can see it from the dough I gain, so listen

If you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga
818 livin' right here, nigga
I'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga
Passin' down the pussy like, ""Here, nigga!""
Fuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it
I came up from the gutter like some magic
Aw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga

The game is a painful journey
Thank God I never came in early
Had I blown up in 19 or 20?
But damn Hollywood would've raped and jerked me
Fame woulda went to my brain and hurt me
I had no idea that it may submerge me
One minute you're on top, the next minute you might flop
Man, every single day I'm learning
I use my ill mind to boost me, still ridin' smoothly
Feels like a movie, real lies, I'm truly
Blessed the ways you ain't yesterday, it's too late yesterday
You straight kill time profusely
Go hard, there ain't no excuse
I get a shot then I won't get loose
But I won't let you
Tryin' to take advantage of my hard earned skills, nigga, no can do
Bitches, I am a boss now
The pushovers been tossed out
I deliver the Raw style
I moved outta my mom's house
Anybody who never believed has been crossed out
I got this shit on lock-down
You rappers been knowin' you never get Hop's crown
Even though I come off as a goofy nigga
I assure you I'm what you should not clown
I'm too hard to digest
You might get your eyes wet, 818's what I rep
'Til the day I die yes, H-O-P is timeless
Why the fuck should I stress?
I have accomplished the mission that most'd be proud of
I'm lookin' down on my doubters
I'm laughin' like, ""Hahaha! Nigga, now what?""

If you're lookin' for me I'll be right here, nigga
818 livin' right here, nigga
I'm the fuckin' man around here, nigga
Passin' down the pussy like, ""Here, nigga!""
Fuck the lavish shit, man, you can have it
I came up from the gutter like some magic
Aw yeah, niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga

Nigga, I'll be right here
Posted on the 818 corner right here
I'm the fuckin' man in this town right here
And I'ma probably die in this city right here
Y'all can find me right here
In Panorama city, aw yeah!
I hear niggas sayin' that they want some raw shit back
It's right here nigga, here nigga

Marcus’ Gospel,No Shame,2017.0,"I done lost myself again
I done lost myself in sin
I've been burned by selfish men
I've been died but held it in
I do not want Hell to win
Life's cold, I done felt the wind
Could it be any clearer?
When I look in the mirror
I just see a jackass with a tail to pin
Me and my family ain't close
So I got some fame and went ghost
I am not paintin' a hoax
You can hear the pain in my flows
They say that life has it's ups and downs
But why do I stay in the lows?
I don't like Marcus, I don't like Hopsin
I am ashamed of them both
You see, all that I have is my money
I had no idea that this was coming
I fell into the stereotype of a rapper
I'm how they package a dummy
This is my reality I embrace
I look back and I can see my mistakes
I just wish that I could rewind the days
I honestly don't want to be out of place
I guess we gotta face
All these issues like this as a human sometimes
Yes, I am losin' my mind
If you ever come to that conclusion, it's fine
Don't ignore all of the proof and the signs
I made my bed, I'ma lay in it
The thought is as soothin' as wine
Now all I need is a suit and a tie, I tried

In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)

Take it away, I want the peace, I want the happiness
I took a blindfolded shot, it was accurate
But in my heart I know I never asked for this
See, this life I'm in, it seem miraculous
Who knew I'd break a few bones when I tackled it?
It's been years and I still can't adapt to it
I cannot predict what my next chapter is
There's a hearse speedin' fast in the ashes and
I feel like I lay flat in the back of it
There's no love in my eyes, so look up in the sky
Bring me back like you did Lazarus
I can hear the Devil whispering, ""Come play!""
Injecting me softly with numb pain
My fingers are covered in blood stains
It's torturing not seeing my son Zade
But one day, that will all change
When the fog strays, it's a lost page
That had blown away into the hallways
In the land where the wild dogs play
When you're confined into a small space
You will know that that's enough to cause rage
I'ma kick until the fuckin' walls break
I don't know what made me walk straight
Into this fire, my soul is burnin' quick
I've been told this isn't permanent
Growin' up, my father made a lot of mistakes
I do not know why I didn't learn from his
Can you direct me to where the furnace is?
I need to do away with pain that's lurkin' and
Maybe figure out what my new purpose is
All these bad vibes are so discouragin'

In my lowest times
I have failed to see
Sunny days are waiting
I'm in need of some company
God, please help this pain
'Cause I don't wanna ever see
This lonely road again
(This lonely road again)
In my lowest times
I have failed to see

Trampoline,Raw,2010.0,"Get it, yeah
Where it's at, right here, yeah
Now

I'm the rap maniac with the hooligan eyes
Who's cooler than I? Wack niggas move it aside
When you heard I was a big deal you were surprised
West coast bitch, put ya W's in the sky
I spent my days as a refugee
'Til the rap game came to rescue me
And left my wrist paved in accessories
A dangerous necessity, I came here to wreck emcees
You're wrong if you thinking Wayne was the recipe
Nah, he ain't worthy of that, the controversy is back
Get out the Kool Aid, stir me a batch
See I prefer to relax but I can't and God knows it
Gotta stay raw with the flow that I'm diagnosed with
Oh shit, niggas keep fucking with my emotions
Maybe that's the reason that I suffer from psychosis
Shocking as high voltage, fuck it, my life's hopeless
So I had to make sure I killed it when I wrote this

Bounce like a trampoline, thousands that's amped as me
Kids run up on your school campus slap a dean
I grew up on baggy jeans, pornographic nasty dreams
Moral of my damn story life, isn't a happy scene
Wish I was stacking cream, wish I had a Lamborghini
Wish I had the cover on a Rolling Stones magazine
I'm sick of the radio playing all these faggot teens
Keep it real, show me something ill that I haven't seen
For ten years I've been working on ill flows
And finally got a fucking record deal and I'm still broke
Man that's not common, bombs that I'm dropping
Are dope, but all that I can afford is some Top Ramen
I notice that ya'll niggas like to dumb the stats
I should stomp your ass out until your lungs collapse
No more corny cowabunga rap, we done with that
It's a wrap, keep it up and get your tongue detached
Come on

I'm the last of a dying breed, Hip-Hop lacks a variety
That's the reason I thrash on society
I get laughed at when I clash with a robbery
Until they feel the wrath when I smash on their dynasty
But I ain't Hollywood, I'm still the same kid
Up on the same shit, rapping in the basement
Catch me at your local school, skating, busting tre flips
Left shoe lace ripped, you know how them days get
Listen while the bass hit, the only thing that changed is
The way that girls act, 'cause now they think I'm amazing
I used to be the nigga chicks didn't wanna hang with
Sitting alone with a Capri Sun and raisins
My senior year in highschool I was always truant
Had a lot of homework but I would never do it
Screw it, I'm the king now, homie take a bow
You need the crowd jumping? I could probably make 'em bounce

Pillow Man,Raw,2010.0,"I've spent about ten years tryna work on my craft
Tryna save this hip-hop shit and disperse of the trash
But all my nerves have just crashed, cuz all the verses I've thrashed
Were meant to benefit my future, I'm uncertain it has
I rarely ever put something out to insert in your dash
Cuz as soon as I became a brand, my own purpose was smashed
I'm feelin' nervous in fact, I got no urges to rap
Now I don't think my fucking life can get more worthless than that
I see these (niggas) blowing up, who never do got the proper game
(Niggas) who fucking suck, Gucci and Wacka Flocka Flame
(Niggas) who makin' bucks, someone tell me I'm not insane
Cuz I feel the urge to run up on a bitch ass nigga and rob his chain
Dang! I thought I had it figured out
See I panic and I pout
Yo I've had it man, I'm out
God damn it, this shit's a clout
I'm the baddest, ain't no doubt
But my madness is about to turn me manic 'til I shout

How come the world is always quick to turn they back on me
Won't somebody tell me, you can go ahead, and fall asleep
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream
Maybe I'm the Pillow Man, maybe I'm the Pillow Man
I'll be in your dream

You all assume I'm evil, but actually I'm so nice
I've always been the lover boy like practically my whole life
Unhappy here with no wife, don't ask me I don't know why
I'm livin' life without no type of strategy to go by
I knew a bitch who I would go pick up when the day starts
A bitch who'd even like to watch me skate at the skate park
A bitch who I was making out with up in the graveyard
The same bitch who went and left my ass with a slayed heart
She cut it like an avocado, secretly hittin' clubs and poppin' bottles
Hanging with thugs or sucking a lots of cock yo
The biggest slut from Loveland, Colorado
Fuck a hoe, that’s Hopsin’s motto, my heart is vacant, you knock it's hollow
She met another guy who left the baby stuck inside
Her vagina then he just split and messed up her fuckin' life
Now she hits me up and I
Say go suck a nut, goodbye
All you sluts can die for wasting all my sacred love supply


To live a decent life what all does it take
I tried and tried to be the best but nothing falls in the place
And I'm a man but my struggle is gonna cause me to break
And just evolve me to hate I'm in a nauseous state
And shit it probably is fake but who's in control of it me or god
Is he the cause of why am I here the reason's odd
I'm broke and need a job, for spending cheese on broads
But y'all don't see the flaws I coat it up to keep it raw
And mc's who's got the most talent in this whole planet
Don't never get recognized when they dope at it
So they go back to the block hustlin' and dope addicts
Some niggas got the 'it factor' some niggas don't have it
Yo I'm at my last tears cuz everytime I think I'm out the matrix
I get sucked right back in
But man I'm hopin' things are change and the soul in me remains
Cuz the talent that I've got is way too cold to be contained

No, no
What did I do to deserve this?

Nah, I wouldn't do that

Okay, alright
It's about to go down

It's about to go down

Yeah, okay (Prodigy)
Check me out, look!

Oh, shit who's that?
I'm the rapper lunatic who comin' at you like a locomotive
I been down, now I'm up
Hop solo, nigga damn, it's like my life is like a rollercoaster
Your flow the coldest? Well I flow below it
You know I'm bloated from eating so many niggas
Ah, hold on a moment!
Homie, I don't need a major label
I'm at home with twitter fingers whippin' up my own promotions
Rap monster, Black Mamba
You can't run from the wrath I've been asked to cast on ya
To all the haters who been keepin' up with my every move
Here's my penis to latch on ya (catch!)
I'm the only MC in this wack genre (bitch!)
Don't look at me, I'ma spaz on ya
Kids, go get the key to your dad's Honda and turn up
Roll up the street and you pass ganja (are you serious?)
I came up with a couple new answers (what's that?)
I'ma need a couple new dance singles (nigga what?)
'Cause I done made a whole lot of money
But I'm feelin' blue still, I ain't talkin' Zoolander
I was Hugh Heff'in on the low
When my girl found out, she was like, ""You bastard!
It's so obvious you never even loved me
You stupid ugly motherfucker, fuck you and her!""
Fame's a web and I'm caught between it
Walk and breathe it, cool thing and it's all convenient
Hoes beggin' me to sign all across the cleavage
Nigga, you should hear the tone that they talk to me with
I'd be stupid if I don't fill 'em all with semen (true)
I don't know where to go with these darker demons (true)

I been on one, charged up like protons
I'm so gone, it's goin' down like nose runs, nigga

It's so fun, look at the hoes come, nigga
Step aside, allow me to prepare for my finale
It's grind time around me (yup)
Damn, Hopsin, you tight, no doubt B
Back at it again with the white Janoski
Look, I ain't innocent, I stay killin' shit
Rape sentences and shake witnesses, I'm an insane menace
Vacate the day premises, my brain's missin'
I date women for eight minutes then play 'em like Seg' Genesis
Straight nigga, but shit, it's too late to take Ritalin
And doctors, they've been itchin' for days to make sense of it
If I'm around, no such thing as a safe citizen
When I'm on the mic I deliver like St. Nicholas
Niggas get in shivers the moment the base tricklin'
You can see I'm not in the mood to play, gentlemen
Forever ill is somethin' you can't fiddle with
You ain't got the balls to hang, okay little dick?

Cut all my fingers off except the middle ones (what?)
Now, bend your ass over and sit on one (what?)
A.K.A. I've lost it, nigga, run (woo)
Whole world gettin' so sick of em
My nuts swing like a pendulum
I'm on Instagram right now postin' pics of 'em
They are so cute together, aren't they? Look at them (aw)
One's bigger than the other though
Just thought I'd let you motherfuckers know
I'm posted in a bungalow, gettin' deepthroat from a juggalo
Please do not get your face paint on my stomach, ho
Where the real MCs? There are no more
Swag ship took sail and they all on board
Holla at me when you wanna learn the art of war
A carnivore, flexing hard like I'm Arnold Schwarz
I'm explicit business, witness sickness
Spit from the lips of mischief
Talk shit, get hit, I can split your wig
With a knife into your dome with my fist to clinch it (that's murder, homie)

And spend your life, so bitch, don't try
I throw you out a fuckin window, bye

I got psychosis
My brain's filled with deadly microchips
I'm plotting your death with crayons and hieroglyphs

Straight through the exit
Fuck a ho and use the same condom on the next bitch
Nasty-ass nigga having sex with a dead chick
Film it with the GoPro, slow-mo, and upload it to Netflix
Uh, excuse me, I hate to bother
Do you know where I can find a little Asian parlor?
Where they'll play with my balls like a game of soccer
And fuck me, too, for like eighty dollars?
I need my dick scrubbed and bathed in water
I hold the bitch down to play some doctor
If I ask her for it, it's gon' make it awkward
If I tip her well, she'll give brains and swallow (oh, yeah)
I'm a nutcase with ADD
Who rapes these beats, don't try cause you can't be me
Ya'll can't be pleased, stop hatin' on my angry steez
It makes me cheese, I barely know my ABC's
But still I'm on and I made like (two million bucks)

Dre heard my shit and said it was great
I'll probably get signed to Eminem any day
And next week, Snoop Dogg, he gon' get me blazed
One time, I opened up a concert for MGK
My big partner, lil cousin, man, he friends with Drake
And Big Boy up at Power said he'll get me play
I had a video on Worldstar, dawg, believe it
I don't know what happened but it got deleted""

Without me

I'm fucking tired of playing God when you in need
The choices you made are on you completely, what's it got to do with me?
You mobbing through the streets, clueless but it's not like you could see
You know I'm cool, so you take it like it's an opportunity
To get some free money, damn you ain't got no shame
You been living off of my dough, bitch I'm not your bank
You be asking to borrow knowing that you not gon' pay
Abusing the privilege my nigga, that is not okay
Why don't you get it? I shouldn't have to explain it
Our foundation should be on some real shit, not you asking for payments
So create a dream, then get off your ass and then chase it
I'm mad and frustrated dealing with this shit, I'm lacking the patience
You the homie, I don't mind you coming around dog
But I should not have to pay for your downfall
Choose your faith, but still even if your day seem great
Just know I got your fucking back either way, you already know

The money I'm making is yours right? It's a given
Let me tell y'all why I get a different feeling
Y'all was living good watching me and my momma struggle once we get the bills in
I don't recall any help or sympathies
Since 15 I been paying rent, you know what that did to me?
Could have been here, had this rap shit popping off, if y'all had lent the hand
But y'all wasn't worried 'bout helping us, you had a different plan
Focused on yourself, and now you holding on for help
You were self centered, and that was just an open door to hell
Oh, you need some money now, yeah of course I know the deal
You want the benefits without playing the courses on the field
You ain't even doing your best or trying
Don't ask me for shit unless you dying, this is me testifying
Just know that when your bright days going straight
I couldn't have your back without feeling strange but you already know

Money can leave you isolated 'cause people are shady
So why debate it? They love cash and fantasize to make it
To get it, we'll fight and break shit, develop unrighteous ways
Even taking the side with Satan, thankfully I've awaken
Foes who abused the privilege by having those who were gifted
Around them close and they vision, stop corroding your friendships
Don't be having your hands out, smiling, hoping to get shit
Mooching off of a man's treasure is bogus and it's just
Not the way you should function with brothers when you're amongst 'em
That is what we call punk shit and it can leave you stuck in
A boat that's already sunken, this can happen to anyone
Sisters, brothers and cousins, they disrespecting, then fuck 'em
That's the way that the fountain leaks, keep on pushing your boundaries
In due time I am bound to see all the snakes that surrounded me
I know that if my brightest days turn gray
You wouldn't have my back unless there was pay, it ain't no secret

I've been there when you needed me the most

And her situation just became a heavier burden

Man it's time for her to go, you done decided, no debating
Cause there ain't no light shining on the future
She wasted all my time and all my mula

You ain't nothing but good for nothing, that's what evidence proves
And now you're just another topic when I step in the booth, bitch

If you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you

See life's just a crazy cycle
What repeats itself, I know
As I grow, I learn from all the mistakes I made
Shit, I'm better on my own
You've got a lot of niggas around and they'll cut you
It's important that you learn to say fuck you
Yeah, they never gave a fuck about me, oh, na, na, na
This is the last laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Man I don't get involved with these phonies no more
I just open the door, and kick 'em all out, I don't keep 'em close
Been through this shit too much, you don't even know
Damn, you used to be the trophy of my life, but now that trophy is broke
And now you're wondering why I don't text back or call you
I deleted you out of my phone, bitch, who are you?
Pay attention close, I hope I come clear
Bitch, if you looking for a fuck, you won't find one here

Cause if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
Oooh, y'all never gave a fuck about me
Never gave a fuck about me, oh no
I said if you never gave a fuck about me
Then tell me why I should give a fuck about you
I'll never, ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever give a fuck about you

Where Will I Go,Raw,2010.0,"I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

The world I live in was never a pleasant paradise
Bullies used to hassle me, then laugh cause I was scared to fight
I let the sun beam in on my skin, but I can't bare the light
So I reside on the side of life with nocturnal parasites
Treated unfair as an infant, abnormal characteristics
Waiting for terror to visit, as I stand there in the distance
Fucking arrogant bitches, you were never there with assistance
Wish I could fly into the air with the pigeons
Let it begin, the story how I never fit in
While the popular kids would run around with seventy friends
I'm just a heavenly sent, waiting for the day that I rise
So I could take my aggression and maybe place it aside
I gaze at the sky with contacts placed in my eyes
Asking why do they only love me when my face is disguised
I'm still waiting for signs but I doubt I'm a ever get them
If I never see any proof, how can I represent them man

I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

I do this because I know it's what I'm destined to be
I do this for the kids who were always messed with and teased
I do this for the ones who were told they'll never succeed
I do this for those who grew up as young and restless as me
Ya'll would always drink and go party with your crew in the nighttime
Doing shit nobody would ever do in their right mind
Then when you got a little older you hit a fine line
With an accidental kid struggling with a nine to five
You always thought that I was so stupid to write rhymes
Thinking I would never make it and lose with the white eyes
But the formula I created proved I was Einstein
Now I've done more shit then you'd ever do in a lifetime
Since elementary, you'd belittle me, show no sympathy
Hurt me mentally, but you never had the sense to see
That your desire to be cruel, was fire to my fuel
Would inspire me to rule, the world until I was cool

I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

I ain't gonna take your shit, I've already lost my mind (lost my mind)
You driving me crazy, so that it makes me cry (makes me cry)
God if you exist then please send me a sign
Because all the rage that's stored in me is eating me alive
Help me out

I've been feeling down but nobody knows
Oh where will I go, lord where will I go
Hey ya, I just wanna kill, I just wanna kill
Nobody knows what I feel, nobody knows what I feel
I said I just wanna kill, I said I just wanna kill
You can all burn in hell, don't fuck with me

Sometimes I wonder what the hell your problem is
Why must you love to see me this low
Won't you just let me live
Sometimes I wonder what the hell your problem is
Why must you love to see me this low
Won't you just let me live",https://genius.com/Hopsin-where-will-i-go-lyrics
Caught in the Rain,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Soon after I dropped 
Raw
 the spotlight creeped up
I received love from fans throughout the world, yeah, seems nuts
Is it God, could it be luck?
I put my toes it the sand and ended up with my feet stuck
When the storm comes, then how should we address it?
My situation with Ruthless turned out to be a blessing
During the time it left every ounce of me affected
But when it was done I saw that I was bound to be a legend
But I'm lost
The fame drivin' me crazy, cry when I'm angry, the game's trying to change me
Sinister record labels got desires to paint me
As the world puts they fucking hands high to embrace me
How would you take it in?
I honestly can't pretend
The only reason I started rapping was to make a friend
And now I got fans who love me for creating sins
You think fame ain't got a dark side? Think again, yo

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am

Yeah, scared I might never get a wife
Closer I move into the limelight shit is like
Girls just want to be next to me cause I rip the mic
Sayin' they love me, but the vibe I get isn't right
What if I flop when my album dropped
And went broke? Baby, tell me, would your love just stop?
See I'm in love with you, but you in love with Hop
The struggle's real, but through your eyes it's fun to
 watch
I swear to god I used to fiend for it
I see the fire but I keep going
I smell the sins from the breeze blowin'
My crew is telling me to beast mode it
I feel like I'm going to hell, I keep it up even my priest knows it
So many women and the money is great
But this life just isn't me and I don't want to be fake
I didn't think that it would come to this day
It's time I put my alter ego to the side and leave him stuck in his grave

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am

Shit, not anymore, my soul's rotten and sore
I hear a knock at the door, for real
I got a lot to endure, there ain't no stopping the storm
Homie, the top isn't warm, so chill
I think I need my light bulb fixed
As of lately I ain't be getting hyped on shit
Life's a journey, you gotta find your niche
I'm leaving this tight space because I don't fit
Now I'm moving away, my whole life I'ma start from scratch
As an artist I'm trapped, fuck Hop, Marcus is back
For a while it's gon' be hard to adapt
But I'm willing to go through it, I ain't starving to rap
I'm soul searching, it's like I'm living with no purpose
I tried find a spark to spit but there's no urges
Inside of me for me to pursue it
, some people think that I'm stupid
But don't judge if you ain't went through it
I'm out

Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused
'Cause I don't know who the hell I am
Fame can make you insane (It's so strange)
Everyday I feel I'm caught in the rain
Only very few have walked in my shoes
I sit alone in my room feelin' so damn confused

Gimmie That Money,Knock Madness,2013.0,"Back when I was a young nigga playing in the sand
I had some big dreams so I made a little plan
You was out partying while I was thinking in advance
Tryna get right hoping that one day I'd be the man
The years went by, I was M.I.A
I got rid of all of the niggas that was in my way
I saved nickels and quarters till I could afford a studio
To record and then get money off the shit I say
Then my dream came true and the fraud niggas came out
See me ballin' out, they think we all gettin' paid now
Talking like ""Hopsin, oh you're a great pal""
Fuck you, stick my balls in your dang mouth
Now every other week you hit me up for money
Frontin' like you always been down (pal!)
But back then when a nigga was living bummy
Your ass was nowhere to be found (wow!)
Look my nigga (Marcus) I ain't tryin to be one of ya fake ass goldigger
Homies that's not it (that's not what I'm doin)
But can I borrow 500 dollers I'mma pay ya ass back next week I promise (please)

I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like, ""Let me have this, let me have that
Let me have this"" and they keep on coming, man
""Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money""

There was a chick I asked out back in ’06
Made her a love song, and she was like “No bitch”
Gave me the song back, and I was like “Oh shit
I’m so stupid, I should’ve never wrote this”
She was a dime piece, top of the list
A Latin girl, and her skin had a tropical twist
She never used to call me, I always had to call her
And deep down inside it was making my heart hurt
So her life went on, she didn’t even involve me
Then last year I ran into her in a Walgreens
She was like, “Marcus, how are you? (oh my God)
You finally made it, I’m so proud of you”
So the next day she called me and asked to kick it
For the sake of the old me that was sad, I did it
Come to find out she was never that terrific
Especially a week later when she asked me this shit
“Hey um, Marcus, I really really hate to be a bother
But my rent is due, and I’m like broke as fuck
So can you please lend me ten hundred dollars, please”

I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like, ""Let me have this, let me have that
Let me have this"" and they keep on coming, man
""Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money""

Mmm-hmm
See my ex girl think she slick
Man let me tell ya how she tried to do me
She said she didn’t have a vehicle to drive to work in
So she came and asked me for 2 Gs
And although I wasn’t that concerned
She said her mom would pay me back, soon as she got her tax return
So I committed and did it, thinkin’ she wouldn’t forget it
But she forgot it, 
now my stomach got a nasty burn
I called her! And said, “Bitch! Where my money?! You got that?!”
She said, “Not yet, see my mom’s mad
She said she isn’t gonna pay, you can drop dead
'Cause I got into a fight with her, she’s a hot head”
I’m like, “That’s between you two, not me!
What the hell does that have to do with my cheese!”
She said, “Ok, ok, stop please
I swear I’ll pay it all back Marcus, in five weeks”
Huh, five weeks huh?
It’s been three months and I ain’t even heard from her
Changed her damn number, shit
Bitch played me like a dumb motherfucker

I can't even make friends
'Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like, ""Let me have this, let me have that
Let me have this"" and they keep on coming, man
""Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money
Let me get a dollar, give me that money""

Give me that dough, Give me that money
Give me that cheese, Give me that money
Give me that yea yea yea, Give me that money
Yea yea, Give me that money
Say yea yea yea yea
Baby give me that yea yea yea yea
Give me that yea yea yea yea! Ha
This for the bitches that oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
(exhales) fuck
I don’t think I’m gonna be able to pay Marcus back

Black Sheep,No Shame,2017.0,"[Chorus: Hopsin & 
Eric Tucker
]
And I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck
And I'm trapped inside my mind, there ain't no loosenin' up
Maybe I'm thinkin' too much, am I caught in my feelings?
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
It's like the rain is fallin' on me, you don't know what I deal with
Oh, I'm the black sheep (the black sheep)
The black sheep (the black sheep)
Are the odds of me being accepted one-in-a-million?
Oh, I'm the black sheep

Fuck, a nigga just don't fit in
No one close to kin
I write about it so much I done broke my pen
And I'm so sick of pretendin' my life is so dandy and flawless
I'm stuck on a road to Hell
Fightin' demons but I let 'em drag me across it
While everybody happily applauds it
Tell me what caused it
Was it Monroe High? That's where I went to school at
All the black kids said I was white-washed
And the white kids said I was too black
When I skateboarded I got booed at
At lunchtime I was who they threw food at
I was tryin' so hard to cope with it
I really wanted to run up on campus with two gats
And just (ahh) let loose
Put some niggas in the E.R. for tryna treat me like a retard
Where the fuck does my future lie? I can't see far
Momma's little sweetheart, he developed an attitude
Picked up a mic, that's a Hell of an avenue
He gon' take yo' ass to Hell and then back with you
Life is a class you can tell I've been absent to
My massive doubt has got me wrapped around
And then it drags me down a bit
I don't know how to cast it out
I try to rap profound so you could laugh about the shit
Truth is, yo, I never laugh
I'm lookin' for wherever Heaven's at
The black sheep, they won't let him past
They would rather get together
Tie him up and then behead his ass, got me hella sad
Listen!

Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is déjà vu for me
[Chorus: Hopsin & 
Eric Tucker

And I act like I don't give a fuck, but I do give a fuck

Oh, I'm the black sheep

That nigga whose brain is off, I am that
My train of thought left on Amtrak
I take the loss and I stand back
I can't play the cards with no hand clap
I can't recall when this damn crap
Became so overwhelmin' I started rebellin'
""I hate"" is all as I stand as
Never got no love from my niggas
And no love from the hoes, pinned up in a hole
Tryna climb out the Devil's dark lab, but the oven is closed
I don't ever leave the house much
I never really thought this would be the outcome
Wish I had a window I was leapin' out from
My family is yellin', ""Please, Jesus, help him!""
When I'm out in the real world, I feel like nobody knows me
What if this whole time I've had an issue and nobody told me?
See, this cold heart isn't cozy
Am I below par and I don't see?
I'm so disconnected from Earth
My hands are out so far but they won't reach
Should I get in a coffin?
Not many niggas would wanna kick it with me
Unless they were gonna benefit of it
Motherfuckers never interested in knowin' me
They just be just itchin' for Hopsin
I'd be frontin' if I act like it isn't a problem
I done shed tears contemplatin' my suicide in my room
Isn't it awesome? (Fuck no!)

Do you ever feel like the world is never gon' want you?
Like the world is never gon' need you?
I always do, every day is déjà vu for me

Right now I hate every fucking body including you
I'm on the edge, you'll be lucky if you do get through
If I go crazy then this the song I'ma lose it to
Please tell my family and my friends this
I was never happy to begin with, I actually pretended
Too many hands I done lifted
All my life plans got evicted, I'm mad I existed
I'm finally dropping all the shit you motherfuckers hand me
The only girl I ever loved doesn't understand me
Since I was young I tried to be way more than what I can be
And people still never showed respect, but act demanding
Y'all mentality is, ""Fuck me""
But I don't need nobody but me, trust me
It don't seem like it but I been living out the matrix

Quit tellin' me shit that I shouldn't do, uhh!
I been blockin' my feelings but now I can't hide 'em
Been lookin' for God, how come I can't find him?
Nothin' in my fucking world seems to go right
Even though I hate suicide, I need to go try
I live my life the way I wanna, I ain't pleasing you
Got a problem I'll fuck you up, I got a reason to
Y'all tried to gain my trust saying, ""We believe in you""
Then you walking on me after all that we've been through
That ain't even cool
Now death is what I hope you get
And just remember that I told you this
We ain't cool, I don't owe you shit
Look what you made of me, now I'm pshh
Matter fact, just stay away from me

Would you be there at my funeral saying, ""Oh, I loved him""?
Or maybe, just maybe, you'd be that one nigga that never showed up
I'm about to lose my mind, why must I have it so rough?
Listen closely as I'm rapping this
I used to think money bought people happiness
It does, but we never think about what happens after it
Since I got it, I started to learn hate, everybody turns fake
Wanting shit like it's their fucking birthday
And that just adds on the stress I'm already dealin' with
What am I 'sposed to let it build and sit?
Hell no, since then my fucking balls grew
I said it once and I'll say it again, ""Fuck all you!""

It’s All Good Now,Haywire,2009.0,"Aye, hold on change that sound like a piano or something it sounds stupid I don't like that, okay yeah

Yo, you ever had a homie who was fake as fuck (yup)
Hate your guts, but the moment you came rolling through ballin'
They wanna say what's up (what's up)
Knowing that you finna' be hot (G)
But I don't owe you niggas diddly squat (nah)
So here help me out by kicking these rocks
Before I got my deal you use to back stab me (what?)
Laugh at me, tell these women I act nasty (ewww)
So what?
You hooked me up with the girl that yes, I'm datin' now
But I know if you had the chance to fuck her you would take her down
You slipped up like you done stepped into an oil leak
Now you got me heated up and boiling
You the definition of unloyalty
Probably plotting how to go destroy the scene
But you'll never destroy the royal king
I know you always reminiscing (uh-huh)
And mad 'cause I'm resisting and won't take the time to listen making us more distant
You on that cold hearted shit
Look how Hollywood Marcus is
You could have been a part of this, but shit you'll probably

Fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give 'em free downloads
But yo it's all good now though
Now if you thinkin' you my buddy
But always acting funny
Then you'll never be close to me (Fuck that!)
Said if you thinking you my buddy tryin' strip me for my money
Then you'll never be close to me (Fuck that!)
Nigga, friends, friends, how many of us have them, I don't really know anymore

I gotta about 3, 4, 5 of them left
And they like my brothers, yes
They all reside on the West
They're down to ride nothing less
That's what their supposed to do
No, but you, walking around like you don't even know the rules
Putting me in bogus moves
Got me stressed out doing yoga moves (Shit)
You ain't no homie, just a load of duke
You mad 'cause honeys never notice you (Well)
Do take it personal (Why)
You'll never look half as good as I do in person nope
I'll never hold you down
I'm flossing on you now
I'm causing problems my momma like Hopsin, awww you foul
I know it's you who's calling blocked ID
But you will not find me
I'm not lying, so stop trying
It's just a waste of time and you a waste of mine
Say goodbye this song is for you George, since you're a grateful guy

Fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give 'em free downloads
But yo it's all good now though

Friendship has been fucked
Quit hittin' SwizZz up
You calling him like you tryin' give him a free dick suck
You ain't a part of the movement, stupid you just blew it
And this shit right here proves it
And don't you email me talking about yo, what's up fool
Thank you for all that you done for me but fuck you
And if you wanna act like a rowdy ape and retaliate
Meet me in the alley late
I'll serve yo ass the Cali way
So don't you dare give my CD's a leak
I'll get your ass easily
Your girlfriend lives right up the street from me
I'll snatch her out from underneath the sheets and while she screams police
I'ma just talk to her grimy like I was Keak da Sneak
Well congratulations you've been dissed
Don't get mad at me, 'cause who did this?
You did this, so what did we learn today?
Never leak your friend's songs
'Cause if you think I'm gonna let it slide
Then you dead wrong

I trusted yo ass man
You had my whole fucking album sitting there on your damn laptop
Leaking my shit, you're a mothafuckin' leaker
I'll never trust yo ass, rawr!

Fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give 'em free downloads

Tim Westwood Crib Freestyle 2014,UnKnown,2014.0,"Ohhh right
Its been two years since I've been up in this bitch, son
Yo

What up niggas I'm back in London
Hungry as hell if your ass was wondering
I've been hibernated up inside a dragon's dungeon
Bitch I promise I'm the wrong jackass to fuck with
I'm mad destructive, past deductive
Master of this rap shit you been trying to perfect
Nigga I spazzed but I never had a sign of tourettes
When I finish bodying this yo who trying to get next?
No I ain't done, wait, the game done changed
You niggas 'bout to feel the wrath of Shang Tsung's rage
Imma bring some pain
Fuck your boo-hoos I'm coo-coo
I shoot through you bitch
I'm repping eight, one eight should've been new
Been packing venues, before Mickey D's put a fucking snack wrap on the menu
Before the swag shit where snapbacks were an issue
Before that nigga beat Christy Mack with jiujitsu
A menace, it's true, I'm killing you fools
Take a nap while your dead body is still in the room
Strictly independent with my millions of views
I be living it how you be pretending you do
Timothy, what these niggas be saying with my back turnt
I bet its a whole lot of bad words
But they smile when they see me
Avoiding a confrontation cause they know I'll be rolling out the black hearse
They don't want no problem with the grim reap
They been weeping, minced meet up against me
So bitch please, I dug a grave hole ten feet
I murder whoever achoos  like I just sneezed
Yo new shit, I wouldn't want to bang that
I'm a fraud, yo, you wouldn't want to say that
If you exclude me then who is gonna save rap
Niggas know I put the pussy on the chain wax
Bow down when you come around this
I'm the motherfucking king with the underground hits
I don't care what you other niggas coming out with
I'm worldwide now I don't give a fuck about shit
All bitch niggas do is talk these days
Blah blah blah blah, oh, he's fake
I'm doing the world tour when it's all prepaid
Living life, vacation out in Aussie, mate
And it all seems great, doesn't it
My life be bubbling I'm loving it
All you suckers mean mugging me, you can suck a dick
Now that I'm buzzing
These motherfucking, bloodsucking, hustling labels want to be down
Y'all should've discovered it
Fuck you, sip a cup of cum juice like its fun to
I'm not the one you should run to
Hit a nigga with the 1-2, there is no strings attached, they have all been cut loose
There's no undo, no Command-Z, life's dandy
Boy, put fear in you like Scoob and Shaggy, zoinks
Dissing me oh that's a nasty, choice
Y'all niggas gonna get my raspy, voice
I spazz like a crack fiend on caffeine trying to doze off waking up from a bad dream
If you attack me then its gonna be a sad scene
Its Funk Volume, nigga you know what that means
You in the backseat, filling you up with gasoline
Do you even have a fucking clue what the match brings?
Me and my niggas say we too stupid to have brains
We pull our pants down and take a poop on the rap game
We nasty, but we got a lot of, cake
Squad looking like we about to rob a bank
Dark ass nigga like Shabba, Ranks
Haters always making me hotter, thanks
It's two-thousand and fourteen, we stacking up more cream
Taking your face, wiping the floor clean
Nigga you gonna need a bigger dosage of morphine
You can't ignore me because I'm the demon in your dreams

Nigga
Nigga I'm the demon in your dreams

FV Till I Die,Pound Syndrome,2015.0,"Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg
I'm the realest, believe me
Niggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me
Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

Yeah, you behind if you don't know the power (nigga)
Product this shit the moment Ruthless started goin' sour (what?)
Niggas is sayin' fuck you to us, but we have spoke it louder
Now they come to us for advice in the game, they know it's ours (true)
Cause It's so hard just to survive in this era
We learn from trial and error, it's hard for cowards to bare us
They know the style is terror, nigga we everywhere
Yeezy and Hov ain't the only niggas that's wildin' in Paris
Back in the day, me and my nigga SwizZz was always in grind mode
Reppin' that 818 was just like walkin' that tightrope
We've seen rappers come and go and get lost in this cycle
So we had to fuckin' make sure we left all of your minds blown
SwizZz? He told me 'bout his brother Damien sayin' that he could create a structure for us
We're guaranteed to make a win
I said I'm in, let the games begin
So he introduced us, then after that
We plotted on some ways to make us trend, yeah

Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg
I'm the realest, believe me
Niggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me
Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

You see, I took a shot out of the glass of mischief
Made an album so raw the way you just had to get it, every track explicit
I figured those of you who was in love with rap would listen
And tell your parents that it's the one gift they should grab for Christmas
Then I blew up way faster than what I had predicted
It's like magic, isn't it, they love my language and graphic image
Some people thought Ruthless put me into a bad position
But I over came it and outshined 'em, I'm back up in it
2011, went on a nation wide tour
Came back and dropped that Ill Mind 4
That put me in a cool place, swiped up a million views in a few days
I celebrated inside of swimming pools sippin' Kool Aid
I shot a video with my nigga Tech and B.o.B
I went from feeling lonely to how does everyone know me?
2012, I made the XXL Freshman list
I knew that this fuckin' game was gon' be mine when I stepped in it
Come on, man

Ya'll ain't even seen the nigga Hop coming
That's how I roll, dawg
The second niggas take they eyes off me
I leave 'em on the side of the road, dawg
I'm the realest, believe me
Niggas can't see me, they'll take a life to be me
Ye-yeah, who the fuck I rep? Can you remind me
It's Funk Volume till I D-I-E, my nigga

I was online chillin', bloggin' and what not (okay)
I stumbled across this one nigga, reminded me of a young Pac (right)
I asked Dame if he heard of Dizzy he said, ""Come on Hop
I been bumpin' his shit before you, bruh, his songs hot.""
If he had that push, then so many doors'll become unlocked
He said we should sign him, I said that's a long shot
We flew him to Denver to see our show and said you fuck with this shit?
He said, ""Shit nigga, yiggity yamp, I'm up in this bitch.""
A few months later, one of the homies had stopped me
Asked if I had seen this raunchy, zombie filled, godly video, that's beyond beast
I said, ""probably, I don't know, who the fuck you speakin 'bout?""
He showed me Skitzo by Jarren Benton, I started freakin' out!
I'm like, oh shit! I had to show SwizZz
And Dame and they both flipped, it's a trip, this nigga's so sick!
We had to put him on quick and blow this nigga up
Now we got a serious squad, the truth, it is nuts

Yo, I took the college route to figure out my path in life
Romp the UCI and that lead me right back behind the mic
I tried to make my dad proud, brother got his MBA
While I was wildin', takin' random classes tryna find my way
Junior year, I had to bounce not to blindly chasin' dream
Calculated riffs, I knew that I devised a perfect scheme
Hop was gazin' at the moonlight,
 I just hit the valley scene
Dame got rocked by the recession, then we formed the fuckin' team
F-U-N-K-V-O-L-U-M-E, nigga
Seven years into this shit, somehow we're only gettin' bigger
And we're just now gonna start the shit, 
I've been up out the picture
Dizzy, Hop, Jarren, and Hoppa stay confident I deliver
So I'm grateful for the chance and the position that I'm placed
Meet the aftermath, the aftermath, the Funk is in your face
Independent livin', we control every decision made
What up Dame? Prepare the reign, we killin' this thing, it won't stop, bitch!

Haha, Zzzeed up
Don't act like you don't know what time it is fool

The temperatures heating up and I’m stripping down to my drawers
Exceeding my limits, forget it, we bouncin’ off the walls (watch out)

Gazing at the Moonlight,Gazing at the Moonlight,2009.0,"Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

It's really hard to focus living in this world of sin
All balled up in a corner is what I wanna curl up in
Some pearls an' Benz, money to spend, girls who's a ten
Fuck it baby, I promise I'll never hurt you again
People fiend to be the best, not the best they can be
I use to be the same way, I guess it's what Satan made of me
It's somethin' like slavery the way Lucifer has us
All this glamorous shit we like, he'll use it to trap us
Then he smiles as we run loose on his campus
And dances circles around us and you think it's fabulous
The glamorous, pay a price it's all hype, it's Satan
But in the mean time shit is all right
Most people think the message I send you is stupid
And y'all are gon' ignore it and just continue to do it
But as long as I made an attempt to convince you this shit's cool
The rest of your destiny is within you

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

I'd rather go broke than go and give my soul away
My coldest day couldn't add up to Satan's prodigy
He's tellin' me to jump, but I'm sayin' I don't obey
They say your soul is not owned until your blood's on the page
And he don't have to own your soul for you to do his dirt
He's the master of ceremonies and that's why music works
All it takes is one rapper to make it big then through him
Satan will have the nation creatin' sin and he wins
Then repeats the cycle over again
For many generations till time is close to the end
And all those times you were saying fuck it
You'll be hit with the day of judgement and burn as the Devil's naked puppet
Take it as odd flows or take it as gospel, shit
I'm just speakin' the truth whether I make it or not, yo
You don't have to love just don't ever hate
And just know with Satan here, this world it'll never be a better place

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah
Gazing at the moonlight, the Devil comes close to me
But mama told me never to talk to strangers

So many times I have fell in this trap
I'm tellin' the facts, he makes it seem like hell isn't bad
Till this day I still get influenced, and even though I know
It's sinnin' I'm willin' to do it, my ass ain't even improvin'
'Cause it's so hard to stop what's been taught for so many years
If I think about it too much I'll just be rollin' in tears
Sometimes I think ""Why am I here? Why do I feel
Like I'd be runnin' in fear if ever the end was near?""
It's like, sin is in so much of everyone's daily habits
That we don't even know we do it whenever it happens
Then it settles in like I should've never did that shit
I wanna enter the gate perfect rather than have this
If you had to turn your test in today
You think you would pass it or would you rest in the flame?
Who knows, there's only one way to find out
And if you die now, no turnin' back, it's your life pal

Gazing at the moonlight, Satan comes close to thee
He says you can have everything if you leave your soul with me
Oh na—na—naaah

Niggas seem to have a problem with what I be sellin'
All I got is dope and I just make the world inhale it
Bitch, I am the GOAT, you're blind as fuck if you can't tell it
I dropped out of school so I could focus on my mission
Principal is callin', Mama sayin' that I'm missin'
I check in to homeroom and then after that I'm ditchin'
Start off bumpin' Dirty Dozen in my fuckin' system
Mom and Dad would look at me and knew my mind was missin'
I look in the mirror, my reflection was my bestie
That's just how it was since crystal took my nigga Jesse
It's me against the planet, motherfuckers gon' respect me
Shit, but I ain't trippin', got a mighty reflex
Stronger like I'm a feisty T-Rex
Mobbin' the streets with a white T 3X
The mic is 'bout to be how I relieve stress
Niggas blowin' up left and right and it might be me next

Motherfucker, look me in the eyes
And you can see it's no surprise
That I've been livin' like there isn't a tomorrow
All I got is grindin' on my mind
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the planet or you'll end up with your heart broke

Doin' hoodlum shit they got me locked up in the county
Fights are poppin' left and right, these motherfuckers rowdy
They gon' whoop my ass if they find out I'm from the Valley
My whole crew is cocky, homie, nobody could stop us
Chillin' on Tobias Avenue sippin' horchata
Shootin' pellet guns at cars until we saw the coppers
Once we got confronted we would lie and say it's not us, gotcha
A decade later I only grew worse
Niggas say they hate me, that's cool, I hated you first
The truth hurts, I guess it's just a few perks
From all my crazy mood spurts
The power of my mind can fuckin' move earth

Motherfucker, look me in the eyes
And you can see it's no surprise
That I've been livin' like there isn't a tomorrow
All I got is grindin' on my mind
Middle finger to the sky
Fuck the planet or you'll end up with your heart broke

In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!
You know where to find me at
You know where to find me at
In Panorama City, nigga!

If you want me to get all mushy as a friend
Then you better give me motherfucking pussy at the end (What?)
You making me feel like a wussy little man
And it's worthless if I don't get the tushy in my hand (Man!)
I don't want to talk for some hours every night
About the man you like, and how he'd rather fight
Than build your relationship, just face it, bitch
I don't give a fuck, fuck him, take his dick
Only reason that I even listen

You think I'm really into that? Girl, put an end to that
I just want to get the snatch, Ching, Ching, hit the jackpot!
Bitch open up your legs like a laptop
Take a fat cock, yeah, then I'll let your ass talk
But otherwise, if you don't, we gon' slap box
Fuck around and ride up on yo block and get yo ass popped
Wasting my time, now I'm wasting my rhymes
Making this song? 'Cause you ain't got naked yet, ho?
You think I put that time in for nothing?
Fuck that girl, we either fighting, or fucking!
And I ain't playing wit' you girl, I'd hate to diss you
No wait, I like to diss you
Turn this shit to wilder issues

I couldn't kick it wit' yo ass a while ago
And now you want to hang 'cause he ain't around no mo'?
What the fuck I look like, after he fucked you?
And he dumped you? Now I'm the dude you run to?
When he wants you, I'ma be the one you flee from soon
Then I'll become the one you got your finger up to?

The Pound (Intro),Pound Syndrome,2015.0,"Rah! I'ma hit a mothafucka with the pound, pound, pound, pound
It's the Pound Syndrome
Good God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound
Un-unbelievable Pound Syndrome
Can you, can you, ca-can you believe it?
The Pound, the-the-the-the-the
The pound, the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound

If you're looking for trouble then you found it, the new album
Of two-thousand-and-fifteen, I'm too violent
This shit seems like I'm cooped out with lucid dreams
I'm a new route for these emcee's
This is a drought that's coming
I'm about to sprout to start a new style's full of envy
I need to cool down what is in me
Everything I had bottled up pukes out when the pen bleeds
You drown from a 16, who's doubtin' the sick steeze?
I could spit a wild verse without taking a breath
Then crowd surf, who's helping this kid breathe?
The worlds against me so I gotta come harder than the average
Think smarter than the masses
Everybody's on the move, ain't no time to get caught up in the traffic
When shit goes down I got the heart of an assassin
This here's harder than my last shit
Gotta do it now, no luck in tomorrow if it crashes
If I do die before I awake, I don't think too many will feel sorrow for my ashes
With this song I've frozen time, don't skip this, don't rewind
The throne is mine, close your eyes as I provoke the mind
This was bound to happen before I wrote the lines
And it's so divine the way my influence multiplied
It's like I created a cult inside this rap industry
Please don't look so surprised
I'm at the top, I ain't throwing down a rope to climb, come on

Pound, pound, pound, pound
It's the Pound Syndrome
Good God the pound, the pound, the pound, the pound
Un-unbelievable Pound Syndrome

I'm just assuming that, I'm a stupid ass who gets a boom from rap
Fuck getting a regular job (shit I'm too cool for that)
I hope I'm gambling right with all this rap shit
'Cause if I failed then I just wasted half of my life
And I'm a dropout, so that just means I'd have to shoot dice
Up on the corner with they line, or just stab you tonight
The type of guy who gives a fuck about my ass only
Get my shit straight and bypass homies
Always talking bout buy that for me
Nigga buy your own shit life is so sick why?

I dedicated my life to this shit, faithfully
I act the way I wanna rap and rap the way I wanna act
And most of you niggas just don't do none of that
I'm setting up a trap for these niggas to stumble over
Who thinkin' they up with Hova, these niggas ain't fucking sober
They not in they mind, and my style boggles the mind
The hottest with rhymes, you not 'cause you not in your prime
I hopped in the ride, and rapid took off into the night

Or no one we would know baby

Can't understand what this shit is about
I'm always the one who getting cut off when trying to speak
At any fucking day, or time of the week, so I decided to be
A fucking asshole, retarded bastard
Why become something that I hardly mastered, it's all a disaster
But I'm gonna make it all go right
And I'm finna become that one nigga that y'all don't like
'Cause all those times y'all dissed me, laughed at me just to make your ass happy

I Must Be on Somethin,No Shame,2017.0,"I must be on somethin'
Lately I been actin' kinda cuckoo
Momma said I got a screw or two loose
I must be on somethin'
The doctor couldn't snap me out of my new mood
I ain't just been feelin' like I used to
I must be on somethin'
I been lost and ain't nobody found me
To be honest it ain't safe to be around me
I must be on somethin'
This shit isn't normal, maybe it's my hormones
Fuck it, man, Lord knows
I must be on somethin'

Shit, lately my logic's been so irrational
Violence is laughable
What's the antidote? I don't have control
I need a chaperone when I'm back at home in a padded zone
'Cause I've been known to speak in a savage tone and slap a ho
Do I even have a soul?
My thoughts are so unimaginable
My brain just hasn't grown
Since I climbed through my momma's vaginal
And I been asked to go to a shrink, it ain't gon' happen, bro
Suck a dick and swallow a massive load!
Bitch, I can explode at any moment
Don't get me goin', 'cause a lot can happen
You talkin' crap and wake up in a fuckin' Saw contraption
A raw assassin, you see me you better be haulin' ass then
Your gashes cannot be treated with Tylenol or Aspirin
No cotton swab or napkin can clean the mess up
It's me and my alter ego against the world, it's just us
Ain't no one who textin' my cellular phone except sluts
It's clear there's a problem with me, so guess what?

Fuck it, man, Lord knows
I must be on somethin'

The world has fucked me, it's time to get even now
They say I'm the one no one wants to be around
Guess it's my deceivin' smile
Guess it's because I been treatin' people foul
Makin' songs about 'em, talkin' shit and then freakin' out
This is how I handle all solutions
There's no false illusion
Fuck an evil witch, bitch, I'm the demon that's off the broom stick
Where's the fire? I'm walkin' through it
Y'all ain't got the balls to do it
I'm talkin' stupid, it's all inclusive
With my psychotic state, filled with a lot of hate
I'ma operate on my enemies
Chop 'em up and then drop 'em on pots and plates
I'm not to fuck with, so stop it, let's not debate
Usually never talkin' much 'cause I'm stuck in a awkward state
The pain I have's everlastin'
Won't be surprised when I'm left in ashes from my hellish habits
The hell is happenin'?
The condition I'm in is probably worse than you can imagine

Fuck a shark, bitch, I'm a sea urchin

You gotta bite like a croc', I'm Steve Irwin
I had to fight for my spot, I deserve it
Look at me rise to the top, I'm emergin'
I ain't gotta tell you to make a CD purchase
It's obvious I body shit, like I got Rocky's fist

Yeah, the king of rap I rose to that
I'm coming at you with shoulder pads
So you don't end up with a broken back

We swimmin' in loads of cash

I'm moving in on luxury train and
I don't care about what the fuck you be saying

Don't assume I'm Mad and needy
When I cop a new house with a massive TV
Growing up never had it easy
I was sad and needy, can't wait for mom and dad to see me
Yeah, alright, you should be glad I'm eating
Life's hard and I pass the beating
You probably think I own the magic Genie
When I pull up on you niggas in the Lamborghini
Like boy, I been killin' it since high school
I slide through, leave the mic bruised
Back when I couldn't afford nice shoes
Now they all got they eyes glued
I'm quite smooth, you shoulda got a fuckin' collab' before the price do
You better get up your cash before you try to
You stupid niggas ain't mashing with the right crew
The following that you had is finna die soon
I'm 'bout to get me a mansion with a nice view
Watch out, bought a plane ticket to Thailand
For five grand, there's white sand when I land
They'll be looking at me like ""Hopsin, my friend! How you make a whole a lot of money like white man?""
Just know I does it, this shit, it's nothing
Ask 'round I buzz to smash down, the sluts and I am erupting
Far from a reluctant bringing the funds in
I love this, you dumb bitch
Who am I? Hope you guessed amazing
Just embrace it, been underestimated
Left for bait, and now I'm 'bout to head to greatness
I gets down like a nigga weapon raisin'
No hesitation with the bad upbringing
You can tell from hotels, I'm sexing babes
And I'm the man that's the best of statements
Now I rest my case, man

Sexy Cyber,Gazing at the Moonlight,2007.0,"Let's meet up tomorrow
How does twelve noon sound for you?

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

Can you believe it, she's finally 'bout to meet her soulmate
It's still trippin her out, she's like ""No way""
No more sad lonely nights of straight horror
Tomorrow she's meeting the lover God made for her
She's looking in the mirror, dancing around the house
With a mess of clothes on the bed trying on outfits
She's acting out how the day is probably gonna be
Like ""Hi Pete, I'm so glad we finally get to meet""
She thinks to herself, ""Hmm, I know what I should do
I'ma call Nicole up and tell her all the good news""
It went to voice mail 'cause Nicole was sleeping
So Lauren left a message, like ""Girl, I'm gonna see him""
She hangs up and falls back on the bed smiling
Looking at the ceiling, daydreaming in dead silence
Eventually her daydreaming turns into sleep
It's love that she's feeling and yes the feeling is sweet

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

It already hit morning, oh darn
But Lauren so excited she wakes up before the alarm
And calls Pete, to see exactly where they're gonna meet
Then Pete picks up and tries to act like he was asleep
Lauren's like ""So where we meeting at? We could try my place?""
Pete's like ""Nah, how 'bout TGI Fridays?
I really love you Lauren and I know you trust me
But it's our first time meeting, I don't wanna rush things""
She says ""That's fine, I'll see you at twelve
Until then I love you baby, hope you'll be doing well""
She takes a shower, does her hair and all that girl stuff
Make-up, lip stick, neck and wrist pearled up
Now it's about time she heads on out to Teej
She text messages Pete, ""Hey, I'm about to leave""
And she's so damn excited as her heart pounds and beats
That she almost left her house without her keys, geez

Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl
Cyber, sexy cyber
Sexy cyber, I love her
Sexy cyber, sexy cyber
She's my sexy cyber girl

She pulls up but Pete hasn't arrived yet
Should she go in without him, she hasn't decided
She doesn't really know how he would act if she tried it
So she just sits back and just relaxes her eyelids
It's twelve-twenty, Lauren picks up an appetite
She decides to go inside without him and have a bite
Then her phone rings, it's Pete so she answers it
Pete says ""Baby, I'm gonna have to cancel it""
Lauren says ""Why? What happened? What is it?""
Then Pete says ""I just heard my grandmother's real sick
And I have to go and give her a visit""
Then Lauren says ""It's okay baby, go handle your business""
She loves him too much so it didn't really bother her
She hops in the car, pulls off, somebody follows her
But she don't even notice 'cause her music's too loud
And she just caught up in the zone of a Ludacris album
Now she's home, she opens the door, moves to get out
Soon as the foot hits the ground, a man rushes up and pushes her down
She drops her keys, the man picks 'em up
Then drags her by her feet into her house like he don't give a fuck
He slapped her, then put tape on her mouth
To take from the sound of Lauren screaming rape really loud
He's going ballistic, her face is covered with lipstick
Then he yells out ""Bitch, Pete never existed!""
Her heads spinning, then she just faints
The man rips off her clothes and Lauren gets raped
From that day on nobody ever heard from her
'Cause that so called Pete guy went and murdered her
He tossed her body in a off-road ditch
He said to her ""see you at the crossroad, bitch""

I Make the World Spin,Haywire,2009.0,"Yo, white eyes, black tee
Ill rhymes, that’s me
Hollywood's now labeled as lame
But I’ve been on that raw shit since I came in the game
Fuck this! Rap niggas trying act like they punk rock
Tight jeans, Mohawks screaming “fuck cops”
Y’all should get your fucking nuts chopped
You all look like you suck cock
Bust shots if you hate me
Yup that’ll fix the problem
Put me out there, leave it up to Mr. Goblin
To contribute to all the bullshit that’s dropping
So he can take his kids out Christmas shopping
Look at the niggas I'm spinning circles around
My verbal profound lyrics make them hurdle the town
They washed up 'til they gurgle and drown
Their whole dynasty I’m burning it down
Funk Volume, you’ve heard of it now

I kick the bitches out
And let the girls in
Your baby daddy shouts
You stole my girlfriend
You see I’m on the prowl
I make the world spin, round
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah baby

Suicide, (huh?) trust I might
Tell 'em what my motto is fuck my life
Don’t need alcohol to upper-cut my wife
So much rage I could crush my mic
See I woke up on the wrong side of the bed
My brain works but the whole left side of it is dead
There’s a little small gremlin inside of my head
And lately I’ve been feeling like I'm living life on the edge
But wait a minute, this ain’t a gimmick, I can’t pretend it
I’ma scream it loud to the world just in case they forget it
Be careful of some of the knowledge that you take from critics
They tryin' to execute a nigga but I stay committed
New topic, mind over matter
Never needed my arms to climb up a ladder
You wack niggas don’t ever show signs of a rapper
It's getting too serious for you? Why, what’s the matter yo?

I kick the bitches out
And let the girls in
Your baby daddy shouts
You stole my girlfriend
You see I’m on the prowl
I make the world spin, round
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah baby

Yeah, the black man’s back
There is no topic my raps can’t smash
The state of hip hop that can’t pass
It’s all full of shit like a fat man’s ass (eww)
May I please have just enough trust
In you motherfuckers to leave the rust of us stuck
I turn my head and now you're messing stuff up
All that ""You! Turn it up!"" Just shut the fuck up
(Damn) I’m rude and I'm so wicked
I’ll make sure you never blow up
Like a balloon with a hole in it
I knock hustlers for a living, got muscles for the women
Got puzzles for the children, blaow
Plus I got a sick delivery, that’ll have you niggas shivering
And stunned from bombs I drop lyrically
You can’t touch my shit
So I’ma end it just like this
Suck my dick!

I kick the bitches out
And let the girls in
Your baby daddy shouts
You stole my girlfriend
You see I’m on the prowl
I make the world spin, round
Welcome to the pain in my life
Yeah baby",https://genius.com/Hopsin-i-make-the-world-spin-lyrics
Cover Up,Haywire,2009.0,"I can tell you’re a real cool girl
I mean it doesn’t take much to see it
And I know we’ve been talking for a while now
And I can kinda see that you’re starting to catch feelings
But I just wanna let you know
That I have very, very high expectations

I’m like Romeo, I’m looking for my Juliet
I’m known for trashing bitches I catch you slippin’ then you’ll be next
Let me find out you’ fascinated by y’all to jewelry sets
Cars and all that fancy type of shit you’ll be surely wrecked
I’ll never trust you, don’t run up asking why not
‘Cause look bitch you got more fucking guy friends than I’ve got
Ya it's true, we share a bond, you’re pretty and the hair is long
But I can get over you very quickly when your hair is gone
If I fall in love and find some dirt, I conceal it well
Then pop out the blue to make your life a living hell
Leaving my heart bruised really isn’t a smart move
‘Cause that’s how you get your ass pushed out a moving car pool
I roll a half a mile when agony till your ribs sore
I won’t give a fuck ‘cause you’re all that I had to live for
Don’t try to date me if you plannin’ on creeping
I have a habit of cheatin’ getting some vaginal beatings, shit

And there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)
If I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon’ be murdered (murdered)
Do you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don’t really know what’s up with you
But you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you

See I respect you, I expect respect likewise
I played the dumb guy once, I played the dumb guy twice
Nobody knows my strife, I never chose my life
There’s never no highlights in this twisted cold twilight
Ill be damned if you contribute stress to my worries
My hearts on its last limb, so it’s destined to hurt me
My last girlfriend screwed me and left in a hurry
And ignores all my phone calls just to disturb me
So be completely honest, is love what your focus is
Or should I pull my dick out right now and get it over with?
Is that what you want? Is that what you need?
Want me to pound your fucking ass till you bleed
The blast a few seeds, up in your coochie
Come on, you can’t bullshit a bullshitter
And bitches wonder why I rap like a cruel nigga
I need a woman who’s amazing that can do right
Until then I guess that ill be gazing at the moonlight

And there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)
If I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon’ be murdered (murdered)
Do you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don’t really know what’s up with you
But you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you

You probably think I’m buzzing, raw, angry and rugged
Aww maybe he’s thuggin’ but that’s how crazy my love is
I’m a dedicated romance brother whose been played
Way to many times now I’m resorting to switch blades
So if I say I love you, more than likely I mean it
Next time I write an agreement for stupid trifling reasons
To dare to fight and the screaming a better life's what I’m seeking
How come bitches now-a-days never try to be decent?
I never even used to use the word bitch
And every chick I ever called it fucking deserved it, they earned it
I’m the type of guy your parents want you to marry
I ain’t no mother fucking mind freak that haunts you who’s scary
But when I’m getting fucked over, that all changes
I get dangerous, my mind turns oh so shameless
And my veins just, pop out my head I’m real anxious
To show you the true definition of what pain is, bitch

And there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)
If I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon’ be murdered (murdered)
Do you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don’t really know what’s up with you
But you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you
And there are souls who cover up and choose to move further (further)
If I find that you fucking around I swear to God bitch you gon’ be murdered (murdered)
Do you wanna die tonight? Sometimes I don’t really know what’s up with you
But you already knowing that my love is true, been saving it up just for you",https://genius.com/Hopsin-cover-up-lyrics
Don’t Believe You Love Me,Emurge,2003,"I can sense that fake in you
Every time I look in your eyes
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me
I can sense that fake in you
And deep down baby I know why
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me

I remember when we first met, you was really cool
Now yo ass is just a nerve wreck, things you made me do
Was outrageous, I even think that I'm going crazy
Never would've thought a ho could make me
Take the fucking route that you been making me go
I'm serious, you think this a joke? (shit bitch), what you taking me for
I guess a joke is what it must be
I call you bitch then I call you ugly
Because you don't fucking love me
The things I do for you, you don't appreciate it
Every night I'm up I keep debatin'
Whether or not I should call up your phone or leave you alone
This type of shit'll stay alive buried deep in my bones
But you don't even notice that
Assuming you don't even know the facts
Fuck you I'm tired of holdin' back
My whole life I've been so nice and that's no lie
Girl yo ass is faking with me and I know why
Cause you don't love me

I can sense that fake in you
Every time I look in your eyes (it's cause you)
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me
I can sense that fake in you
And deep down baby I know why (it's cause you)
I don't believe that you love me
I don't believe that you love me

Love, love, love, love, love
Oh why ain't you real with me, yea, yea

I really wanna solve this but not with violence
It's like if we wanna fix things I gotta be the one who apologizes
And that's not the way it should be, I ain't a rookie
You got the game twisted up, take a look and see
I even made you a song on various albums
Now I'm like ""Fuck a bitch, I'll do better without one""
You ain't gotta be with Hopsin (why)
I know I made a hell of a impact upon your life, I'll never be forgotten
But you will soon as I finish this song 
cause you've getting upper hands and that shit is just wrong
My feelings were strong, it's time for me to really move on
The feelings is gone cause you don't really feel me no mo' (fuck it)
It's yo loss so bitch so long
You ain't gonna stress my ass oh no
Be straight with me I'll be straight witchu
But since you fake with me I got hate for you


I'm tired of saying fuck a ho then always being gullible
It done happened so much I'm thinking it's uncontrollable
I'm screaming ""I don't give a fuck"" all the sudden
I'm driving to pick her up even though this bitch is nuts
I don't even get a trust ring I just keep gettin' stuck
But shit I done seen enough, man fuck I should beat her up
Nah, cause if I did that then I'mma get mad
And wish that I hadn't a did that so I just deal with this crap
But I ain't dealing with it ever again
Your problems only turn me into the cleverest man
No settlin' in witchu, rather settle with sins
For the rest of my life they go to the devil instead
These levels have spread way further than I had imagined it
I should've blew you off when I had a chance at it
But no, I was dumb I had to grab the shit
Tried to show you love and now disaster hit",https://genius.com/Hopsin-dont-believe-you-love-me-lyrics
Don’t Tell Smokey Doe (Novi Novak Diss),UnKnown,2011.0,"Yo, I'll do me and you do you
Tell the world how you fake all your Youtube views
Using Wiz Khalifa's name just to boost you through
Not only hoes trip, but apparently you do too
You kinda sick, but homie I'm like the swine flu times two
You wanna take it off tracks? Fuck it. I'll fight you
You stupid as your dumb fan puppets you lie to
Telling them all that Lil wayne wanted to sign you
Bullshit thats a bunch of crap
Theres no proof Wayne gave you a contract
Whats up with that?
And if he did put one up for grabs
You turned it down cause he wouldn't kiss you like he does his dad
Fuckin' fag back down or get burnt quick
You like the confidence I gave you on first diss?
It was on purpose, I knew if I threw the first hit you'd respond
Now I'll prove that you ain't worth shit
Am I a beast? Of course it is true
I strangle Novi in his booth
Using his mic cord as a noose
Board up your room, you're doomed
By my whole rep of tunes
And soon
Your fans gonn' turn on you
Like some wicked goons
I don't care to pull your card, you deserve it
You're the reason white rappers have it so hard
You actin' tougher than a
Nappy afro that won't part, but you're like a mannequin, all body with no heart
Your whole game is whack, Novi Novak?
C'mon, be real.. what kinda name is that?
You a shameless act, who's lame, infact
You try to gain fame
Pretend like you were raised with blacks
Black psychos? You're glad I can't be called that
I'm only crazy over Raw tracks
But you ain't nuts either nigga, so fall back
Closest thing you ever been to nuts is lickin' your daddy's ballsack
You bullshittin' sayin' Hop sucks
You smoke a lot, but I'm one hit of dope you should not puff
Ya I heard your diss, it was hot stuff
I see you Googled my name
I tried yours, nothing popped up
You act like you the hugest star
You strung out like a used guitar
You couldn't get a hit standing in front of a moving car
The only time you tour is at an amusement park
Stop denying it you can't hold me
The flow is nastier than anchovies
Don't be up at my show in Chicago tryna act like you my damn homie
Fuck Swag City followers, and Novi",https://genius.com/Hopsin-dont-tell-smokey-doe-novi-novak-diss-lyrics

Hopsin is sicker than a nigga
Who sobbing from hiccups and vomit his liver (What?)
You wanna blow up? Stop gobbling liquor and probably consider
Plottin' some shit up to get popular quicker
Phonies get too many plays on the station
And leave me assed out of a deal while they on vacation
Shit I'll leave these rappers face on the pavement!
This game's filled with more whack niggas then a slave owner's basement
But I'm a freth of bresh air
I mean a breath of fresh air
MCs are next to catch hell
I leave 'em wrecked and then scared

Just because Oprah don't want me saying bitch no more
I'm like ""Oprah, why you doing this?
Come on, this is ludacris
That just hypes my ass up even more to call YOU a bitch!""
This is my life, and this is my urge
This is my mic, and these are my words
You can't stop Hopsin
Forget it, its not poppin
I kick the shit that niggas love when they hot boxin
Right when you was bout to retire from listenin rap music
I reversed and turned you back to it
It was a close call

Be happy

You ain't fucking with what I brought to the table
You just a tax write-off for your label
You outside flossing you Range Rove
Hoes eyeballing your bankroll
'Till you flopping all the money back

Be My Friend/High School Dropout,UnKnown,2012.0,"I never had a lot of hope
I looked above and God had spoke
And said I'm only here because my daddy's fuckin' condom broke
Did I ever go to college? (Nope)
And even got no job for dough
I'm looked upon like I'm a joke
'Cause this the shit that I promote
The Ill Mind Of Hopsin!
Where real life's an option!
The ill lines that I spit make you realize you're not sick!
Science at its finest tell Bill Nye to watch it
Now turn this shit the fuck up 'til you feel high and nauseous
You fake thug rappers be frontin' like you was born with Glocks
But only time you ever bang is when the door is locked
Nigga with attitude just without the S curl
I break rappers like promises with my ex girl
I'm kinda strange
And I been this way since a young age
The biggest book I've read was less than one page
I've always had slump grades
Never use a condom like I want AIDS
A nutcase, I'll smash your fuckin' dreams like a pugs face

I'm a high school drop out
Still living at my moms house (My moms house) (Oh yeah!)
I talk shit and get knocked out
My life sucks and I'm not proud
Ohhh do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on then
Do you wanna be my friend
I would love to be your friend
Come on then

My life's lame, I gotta pay money to fuck a whore
I couldn't pull a damn anorexic bitch in a tug of war
I'm sick of big headed niggas feeling above the lord
Somebody please give Soulja Boy the ""You Suck"" award!
Out of all the styles you just had to pick the wack shit
Hopsin won't attack you if you practice
You faggot little bastard
I never would have imagined this would happen
I should fuckin' power drive your ass into a cactus
Yo, the game's mine, go rule you own
I got a foolish zone
I'm a schitzo who carpools alone
Relax this is the music that I make for maniacs
Who can't adapt with the rest, now watch the chain react
The world's cold, open your mouth and let me come inside
I diss the fuck outta rappers its 'cause I wanna die
I never face my problems
Shit I always run from mine
I fucked my life up, now I'm tryin' to give your son a try


Yo, I come from a land where the kids fail to sick hell
So if you're frightened by my lyrics and looks bitch, yell
Brainwashed, by Slim Shady and D12
Crooked, Ludacris, Missy Elliot, Big L
Well, y'all know Hopsin, but let me explain who Marcus is
I make inspiration on music for the retarded kids
Who suffer from Parkinson's
Whose bodies have parts missin'
'Cause it's Special Ed, man you really don't know how hard it is
You know I've always been a know-it-all
I thought that when I'd grow up tall
I'd get pussy and not be using blow up dolls
I want more hoes
I can't control my hormones
I'm always watchin' pornos in my bedroom with the door closed
Whoa! Hey Hopsin!
Stop with the mental hacker games
You've already brainwashed our son, Alexander James
He's only half your age, and now he masturbates
His whole perspective on the things that really matter changed",https://genius.com/Hopsin-be-my-friend-high-school-dropout-lyrics
Super Duper Fly,Gazing at the Moonlight,2009.0,"Uh, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, turn me up
Yo, just leave this shit up to me, pal

They call me Hop, the king of this hip-hop
The moment that I hopped in the game it got hot (Okay)
Rappers thought that they would be ruinin' my plots
In this industry but homie I'm doing it voila
Soon as I step up the flow, niggas know I'm untouchable
With the mic I'ma cut ya throat, guess it's 'cause I'm so rugged, yo
I'm keepin' it real, fuck the dough
I'm lying, homie, I love it, yo
I'm a beast at this, I ain't really unleashed it yet
Obviously I have, I'm just bad at keepin' it secretive
If you do wanna piece of this, buddy you can receive it quick
Yeah, I know that you sayin' fuck Hopsin, he's a dick
I give the sheets a clip of how I metamorphed the game
I'ma wreck it off the chain, 'til my records often played
Spread a web across ya name, make sure you stuck in it
Grab ya belt and buckle it, time to end all this fuckin' shit

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly
Hey, I'm so fly (Fly)
Look at me flyin' away (Ooh)
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh

Now the bomb is lit, flow is one word: astonishing
Becoming different, changin' it up is what I’m promising
Yeah you got potential and all a that but you not as sick
Someone tell these low, down, and dirty fuckers who Hopsin is
It's been awhile, feels like five hundred years
But the apocalypse is finally here, a lot of these queers
Just run around thinking that they hot but they cold as fuck
When I drop that shit gon' be over and y'all gon' know wassup
Niggas acting like that they hate to show love
'Til they find out what I'm capable of
I'm finna fizz up like baking soda, put so much pressure on you niggas you'll be forced to exit the game, 'cause my games is so tough
But you muthafuckas is probably gon' keep on coming back like roaches
But I have the potion, I'll eat you just like a pack of vultures
'Cause I rap ferocious, y'all lack emotion that's needed in this
I bees the business so what can I say, I just need to win it

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly
Hey, I'm so fly (Fly)
Look at me flyin' away (Ooh)
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey
(I can fly, I can fly) Hey (I can fly) Uh-huh

My image doesn’t appear to be vicious
But just by hearin' me rip this
I'm sure that you could tell I'm lyrically gifted
It's a conspiracy, is it?
Definitely, if you step to diss me
I'll make sure you restin’ in peace, switch a mic, I wreck an emcee
Evidently I'm known to killers, the devil in me
You can tell it's in me, my flow has been mastered elegantly
If you fellas tip me it's 'cause you feelin' the jealous envy
Next I put more thought in it before you sell ya cd
I wouldn't say that I'm the father of rap, but raps father died so I just adopted his ass
Since none a y'all will take him in, watch what I'ma make of him
The nigga finna be the muthafuckin' hottest thing again
Y'all been treatin' the game wrong, man Hopsin ain't ya friend
I ain't taking back none of my words, fuck who they offend
Y'all claimin' that y'all niggas from the hood and the streets
Then why's the motherfuckin' game Hollywood as can be?

I got some flows and they super duper nice
Just gimme a dope beat and I'll be super duper tight
Lace it up, sell it for a super duper price
Why? Why? 'Cause I'm super duper fly

Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what

Now may I kick a lil flow for y’all
That’s slow and raw
For niggas who thinking the west coast fell off
But first, I’d like to give a little toast to all
Who’s souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be getting with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the imposters
Y’all destroyed hip hop - Good! (Mission accomplished)
Now I’ma make them regret this shit
Bringing back all the elements
Making these fellas swell up
And tell them that fucking hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I’m prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it’s over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be up out this bitch like hocus pocus
I’m so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I’m about to blow up even bigger than my nose is

Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what

I’d like to bust another verse if I may
The mess I made, make rappers want to catch my fade
I’m just not sane, all y’all affect my brain
So don’t be running up trying to put me in headlocks mayne
It’s like I pin 'em like a poster, get 'em and then roast 'em
When it comes to this verbal abuses, do not approach him
I toast 'em, bury them in an oasis
Then write a book on how I did it like OJ did (stupid stupid)
I’m that new nigga all the kids gonna look up to
With a middle finger in the sky screaming “Fuck school”
You don’t want your child bumping Hop? Nigga fuck you
Who’s a better dad? You or me? Let your son choose
Girl, why you acting so passionate?
You smiling at me like I was attracted to fat women
Shit, go dance your ass up in the cut with your big butt
Come to think about it, never mind I could use a nut

Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what

Still the same nigga, still using Fruity Loops
Play this shit up in the club, watch what her booty do
I ain’t got to fuck with all the high tech shit
I keep the kitchen grimy cooking up my next hit
I guess it’s how I was raised, and now I get paid
To go and write some bullshit a couple hours a day
I just pop a tune on and the music will move me
My message is deeper than this shit if you listen closely
Yo, I got a habit for smashing faggots
In fact I’ma dashing rapping savage
Assassin who has a passion
To just see 'em, read 'em, eat 'em
Beat 'em, flee 'em then feed 'em to muselina
I seem to be the most heated speaker
I’ll defeat your leader
Freak your diva then freaking leave her
Hopsin, he a demon
Y’all knowing he a beast (what!)
How the fuck am I supposed to act?
The west coast is back! (Westside!)

Break it down (down down down down…)
Gotta get up (get up), say what
Get up (get up), say what
Break it down (down down down down…)

Don’t Trust ’Em,Gazing at the Moonlight,2009.0,"Hey yo, pass me a Kleenex before I lay this shit down
I can’t believe this shit man
I tried to be a lover boy, little bitch broke my heart
Words of wisdom

Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

What happened to “be honest with me and I’ll be honest with you”
Your whole past Mrs. Innocent I thought was the truth
Bitch had me felling ill on my knees barfing my food
I’m no longer the same nigga now; I’m heartless and rude
My homies said never trust a ho, but I casually ignored it
Till I got caught up in it, now I see the reason for it
But I had to be retarded, go and release my heart
I always thought that I’d bring the drama, never knew she would spark it
That’s just the way to learn, I go the tables turned
To get to my cold state of mind I had to make it burn
For pussy, one night stands is my only source
Fuck that love shit little bitch, I’m feelin’ no remorse
Why should I? You had me acting like a fool
Trapped inside your loop because you’re afraid to sacrifice the truth?
Come on, how many niggas you really fuck with?
How many time you really suck dick?
Quit lyin’ to me you dumb prick

Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

I’ll never find love, screw it, fuck it
Been through enough shit
There’s nothin’ you bitches can do to go renew your justice
I’m too disgusted and I’m tired of being played with
You should have thought about all this prior to the occasion
You fucked around, thought for a while you was amazing
Till I got the pieces and piled up the equation
Had a nigga goin’ in and out your crotch
Not knowin’ this little skank done been around the block
A year later out the blue we having trust issues
After I already fell in love with you
Come to think of it the image does fit you
You fucked every nigga on the thug menu
And I’m the dumb kid who
Thinks he found his soul mate, he’s blinded by the light
Till it goes dim, now his hand is right beside a knife
A violent type of life is what society offers
Man, why even bother?
Just remember

Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
What have I done to deserve this?

They’ll hide their colors from ones they wanna love
Even if you ask her, more than likely she ain’t gonna tell
Been through this too many times, so take it from me, ooh take it from me!

Yo if you about to fall in love you need to think twice on it
‘Cause girls are trifflin’, they’ll start lyin’ when they invite you in
Have you feeling like the man; you think you found a keeper
Girls have said they love you; but when she say it, the sound is sweeter
Your love drowning deeper, now she’s acting like she smoking pounds of reefer
Confessing that whole fuckin’ town done beefed her
Then you like “I left this bitch with my heart, she ripped it apart
I should have seen this from the start”
The shit you and her go and do it sounds nice
But the fact remains, 
you don’t turn a ho into a housewife
That’s what the fuck I did, and I regretted it, that’s why I’m negative
No medicine could get rid of this
The next bitch who lies to me, watch me damage her
I’m pickin’ her up and body slamin’ her
And that’s real, so if you think your girls a ho but you didn’t witness it
Assume she’s a ho, till proven innocent
And just remember

Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever trust a ho
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t trust ‘em
Don’t you ever, ever, ever, ever, trust a ho
‘Cause ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’
They’ll slip right under your surface
Ooh ooh ooh they be lyin’

Please simmer down go and take your seat
'Cause there ain't no peace

A small percentage of niggas started off soundin' okay but they didn't ever remain on beat

If you already went and submitted in it then you ain't gonna make no cheese
Sorry Bro, hate to bust your bubble
Put the mic on down go the fuck home, cuddle

And then they yell ""uh oh, I don't want no trouble""
Come journey into my cut throat jungle
Where I leave rappers and sluts so puzzled
If you didn't notice I'm loaded with heavy artillery
Nigga I can fuck around and crush your hustle

Yeah, oh right, I bump it all night, I got bitches on my dick
They say the love me all the time and I still sound very fly
Even when I don't even try
This here is my new jump off I call it Suicide

None of you niggas is about the prosper
You on more bullshit than Waka Flocka
Don't cry to me 'cause I'm not your papa
I'm as hot as lava
2012 I'ma stop the drama (OH YEAH)
I know I be yapping a lot
Maybe 'cause I have the fattest of cocks
I'm me, you should be mad that your not
Now sit and wait for Knock Madness to drop

WOAHH woah
Boi got flames and he ain't playing around no more
I say
WOAHH woah
Boi got flames and he ain't playing around no more

Darkside,UnKnown,2013.0,"You don't really know what I can do to niggas if they penetrate the home of mine
Load it up and hit the motherfuckers with the Smith and Wesson 729
Dirty Harry on them real quick
Make a nigga feel real sick
Funny how they wanna get me now that everybody swingin' on my dillznick
What you wanna do?
Nigga what?
Trippin' with the crew give it up
I'ma live it up
6 6 triple 8 46 99 3
Find these niggas overseas makin' hella cheese
Fuckin bitches lookin' Chinese
If you gettin' down with the sickness
If you clowns you can get this
I know it sounds hella wicked
If you frown you a dipshit
We can do it nigga if you wanna but you never will prosper
Never fuck with the darkness
 I'ma hit the playa haters
Get a little cocky nigga I'ma live it up!
I'ma get what money can't get us, never with the funny brand niggas
Stick 'em with the sickening shit and really wicked like a nicotine (BITCH)
Gimme the big (car)
Gimme the big (house)
Gimme the big booty bitches
Me and Ockwizzle livin' in Cockdizzle
On the mission for them riches

Now I'm on the darkside representin'
'Cause I lived a hard life and heaven didn't
Arrive in time enough to save me
So I'm givin' you back what you gave me (Don't blame me!)
Don't bother me while I'm trying to pack
'Cause I'm goin' away and I ain't comin' back
Doctors say my brain's a little off track
Allow me to tell you a few small facts

Yo, do you know what the fuck it's like stuck inside this hell hole tryna crush a mic?
There ain't a buck in sight
I'm sleepin' with the dust and mites
I scream because I ain't got the guts to cry
What the fuck did I, ever do to be put here?
Is it because I'm a black nigga who looks weird?
I try making 2010 a good year
But I don't even see an outlet I could gear
Every single morning when I be waking up I'll be tryna develop a dope new age rap
But before doing it I going to the kitchen
And get me a couple noodles and a Kool-Aid pack
Motherfuckers wanna slow the momentum
'Cause when I kick a syllable I never caught up the venom
I done battled a lot of niggas but they don't get to win 'em
The minute I pin 'em up, hell's where I'm hoping to send 'em, come on
My careers got no solution
Can't wear my contacts I got no solution
Everybody keep on tellin' me I'm s'posed to do shit
If you was on the edge how close would you get
To cutting a neck for some fuckin' respect?
'Cause you stuck in a debt and they ain't cutting a check
The pain up in your chest
All the sudden ejects
'Cause you turned a record in but they wasn't impressed
(Fuck that!)

Now I'm on the darkside representin'
'Cause I lived a hard life and heaven didn't
Arrive in time enough to save me

Yeah, why? Who wants to know?
My mommy doesn't like me listening to you, but could you
Like sing me one of those songs? Like, like one of the cool ones?
Man I got to go man I'm not tryin to sing...
Please?
Alright, alright alright...

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!

Ayo it's time to bring the West back, 
pass me the exlax
So I can shit on all these niggas when I wreck tracks
Your flow ain't that ill, I think you should adjust that
Homie I don't mean to be rude to you, it's just that
You ain't the first nigga I seen with an attitude
Up on the mic tryin' to explain what the gat'll do
Your skills won't get you that place up in Malibu
You better off tryin' to go slang with a bag of fruit
And leave it up to me, I got the bubblies
I'll do in an hour what would take your ass a couple days
My contacts make the ladies fall in love with me
He's the joker of rap is what these motherfuckers say
I'm slightly psychotic and idiotic but modest whenever spotted
So logically I'm a prophet, face it niggas you just suck
And as far as your game, it ain't never had legs to step up

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!

Man I'm tired of the ghetto, hope I make it out this place
Ill niggas running around like an ape up out the cage
And it ain't about the change, man these things are not the same
All these killers wanna leave my brain laying on the pave
And I ain't did nothing, all these little kids cussing
Learning from their big cousins how to go and get stuck in
A correctional facility, messing up their liberty
Acting a fool making unnecessary enemies
Yes it's very weird to me, I did not get caught in it
I was into rap, for some reason I love the art of it
I ain't never drank or smoked because I'm smarter than
That and I didn't want to grow up to be what my father is
Gotta make a living, got plans of moving out the hood, not stayin in it
I hate these cheap apartments, and these vague complaining attendants
Roaches in the kitchen but I ain't really trippin, I'll be rolling in a minute, singin

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!
Shobedibeebop, shobedibeebop, bidung, oh baby!

On the mic I burn niggas and turn rappers to singers
I learn that on the day I confirmed I was the slayer
I serve packs of these haters my words actually rape 'em
And where's daddy to save him? My urge has to be fatal
Up in this music shit the sky's the limit for rising in it
Long as I'm consistent and keep on using my eyes as gimmicks
I'mma be the talk of the town, walking around
Like ""Yes this rap game, I'm the boss of it now""

It's the B Bop, my B Bop song
Do the B Bop, ain't nothing wrong
Come on!

Have You Seen Me?,UnKnown,2013.0,"Today's Thursday November 7th, 2013
And I'm fed up with doin' all of this business Hopsin Knock Madness shit, man
Fuck this rap game

I swear to God I'm feelin' so sick (so sick)
It's like I don't know where my home is
 (home is)
A nigga gone, you can see it in my eyes
I ain't even got the strength to fucking cry
So tell me if you can find me
Where'd I go? Have you seen me?
I don't know
You see I used to think that my money would bring me happiness and
Now I can't believe this is happening, where did I go?

A nigga feel gone, lost, ain't got no purpose
Spent a year locked in churches
Trying to jot the verses
But I'm stuck with these rotten curses
Every time I rap you can hear the pain burn through
'Cause I never had a real family to turn to
I got shit on my nerves
To give me the urge
To yell curse words but I'm really tryin' to learn to keep it all under control
But I can't 'cause I'm stuck in a hole
The devil tryna puppet my soul
Making me a slave to the game, taking away my joys and then handing me a bucket of gold
No! I don't want it no more
Take these groupies, I ain't fucking your whores
Imagine being fed when your stomache don't roar
I wake up every morning and in a rugged cold war
Fuck my life
, 
the fuck am I doin', man?
Hopsin, you're the man, I love all your songs I'm like a really big fan
Issues occured and started back in high school when I used to get beat on
Now I hide myself with contacts and the fame's a drug I O-D'd on

I swear to God I'm feelin' so sick (so sick)
It's like I don't know where my home is

A nigga gone, you can see it in my eyes
I ain't even got the strength to fucking cry

Where'd I go? Have you seen me?
I don't know
You see I used to think that my money would bring me happiness and
Now I can't believe this is happening, where did I go?

This is not on my album

I just made it today 'cause I just needed to vent...and talk
Sittin' in this fucking basement, it driving me crazy

Story of Mine,Gazing at the Moonlight,2009.0,"Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

Mommy never had shit, neither did pop
And that's exactly the reason that he beat her a lot
So shit, as a kid I had to be a cheater and rob
Dealing with all of the consequences of me getting caught
Life appeared to be cool when I was young 'cause I ain't notice things
Rent was paid every month with no problems so it seems
And as I got older I would catch on to things
Then I start to notice that shit ain't the way it's 'posed to be
Come to find out we’ve been up in a rut
My mom feeling like she got a knife stuck in the gut
And dad tripping out for no reason, cussin' and stuff
I'm trying hard, sucking it up like fuck it, it sucks
And Christmas in our household was not that popular
'Cause all I ever received was socks and boxers
My friend got a Power Rangers toy and a Mega-Zoid
It was official, mark it on our fucking family record: poor

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

When I was 17 my dad moved out
He refused to try and help us get a brand new house
So that just left me, my mom and my sister
And it was up to me to be the man to polish our future
We was slowly falling apart
I felt the pain all in my heart
When my mom would go and crawl in the dark
And cry her lungs out 'cause she knew that our good times is up now
I ain't know how to deal with none of it, I was strung out
Finally my 18th birthday hit
I would had left, but I had to help her pay rent
My homies got their own place, they living very nice
Sipping on some Bacardi and throwing parties every night
They mom buying cars, new 3-50 Z's
Well my momma are in debt, at least 50 G's
That means I got to work harder just to get by
'Cause if I don't we'll be struggling for the rest of our life, fuck

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
Pay attention closely to my story (alright)

God I hate to cuss to you, but I hate my fucking life
Nothing's right it's cold in my world, it's never summer time
It is a test? Giving me this mediocre lifestyle
If I'ma get it then it needs to happen right now
I'm one week away from jumping off a cliff
Or putting heat up to my head, and then dumping off a clip
I know you think I'm just lying, 'cause last time
I stood next to a cliff side, I bitched out but I'ma do it this time
Man forget it, we both know I'm not
I just say that stupid shit because I'm so low on guap
But for real though, god man you've got to help me out
'Cause I know the road I'm rolling on is not a healthy route
From now back to the day I was a little kid
Shit ain't even brighten up a little bit
Now wouldn't you be just a little pissed if this was you
Yeah I'm cursed and it's the truth
Looks like I'ma have to resort to violence to get the loot

Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P
I'ma tell y'all a story of mine about how the lord put the weight on me (that's right)
Y'all now in the place to be yeah you rocking with the H-O-P

BET Backroom Freestyle,BET BackRoom Freestyles Collection,UnKnown,"Yo, I stepped in the backroom so I can wile out some
You know that I'm ill, I ain't just thinking out loud bruh
Call me King Hop, the one you need to bow down to
I keep em' popping up just like the hair on Alfalfa
Yeah this nigga is raw, you ain't seen nobody spitting this hard from the West Coast since Kendrick Lamar
You MCs with predictable bars who thinking you invincible just might get kicked in your jaw
Somebody hit the alarm
The world is 'bout to hear my flow roar
Got these other rappers sweating bricks and feeling so sore
Niggas like ""Oh Lord, this guy Hopsin goes hard
Fuck Obama and Romney, he's the one we should vote for""
So trash anything that ain't me cuz this is music
So cold you need a sweater when you listen to it
I'll be getting stupid and spitting fluent moving the gripping units while whipping through this industry cuz my shit is ruthless
Yeah this kid is foolish, ghetto with his pants saggin
Stopping me there ain't no chance at it, it just can't happen
I got fans stacking all across the globe all because the flow homie, even your mama hopped on the bandwagon
Cuz last year I had a great summer
You're mother made supper, and afterwords I got some brains from her
But she was clingy so I changed numbers
I left a sorry note under your bunk bed that she was banged under
Man it's a cold ass world but the core's hot
I don't follow rules at home, my ways are so unorthodox
One time I was in my room bored and found some porn to watch and dad caught me jacking off because I left the door unlocked
Fuck, my mind is all twisted
I spread peanut butter all across my balls and let my dog lick it
Remain calm snitches
I'm not supposed to be cussing this song, so promise me you won't let my mom listen
Yo, all you rappers seem a bit fake
Man, I should ""Human Centipede"" both of your lips around my dick base
Snap your mixtape
, 
stab your rib cage, and take my skateboard and rub your face across the grip tape
I've been this sick for years and you're alive to witness it
Uh, I puts it down like somebody caught me stealing it
I'm looking for a mil to get, crazy but I'm still legit
You can't avoid me now, I'm everywhere, you gotta deal with it

Work it when you slurp it, make sure that you jerk it
And swallow it and then burp it, once it has been inserted
Maybe I will give you a pat on the back if it is worth it (thanks)
Stick this sword inside your mouth like it was a circus
I wanna Slurpee and sticky when you get jiggy with licking me physically it will be like a paradise (dise)
While you doing that you can put my scrotum inside of your palm and maybe play with them like their a pair of dice (dice)
That'll be nice to have every night I'm sure that I'd be walking around with a happier life
Girl come over here snack on my pipe (But I want chicken)
Bitch beef stick is what you're having aight now shut up
So don't be trying to fight it, open your mouth and let me slide it inside it, but don't be trying to bite it
Or we'll be fighting tonight and then you'll be crying and trying to call the ambulance sirens and I'll just say that you lying (Ha!)

Oh yes it is, a matter of fact, you can have the rest of it
Let your lips just caress it, and rest against it it's heaven biotch
And you can keep your mouth open 24 hours seven days out the week like your ass was 7-Eleven biotch
My shit is alright, full of caffeine keep you up all night
Make your life all bright
Don't know what you heard, shit
You feeling thirsty, you can get first dibs 'cause baby girl you deserve this
More than anyone slurp it soon as your Henny's done

Just sip it up like he don't give a fuck don't be giving up
Then I will zip it up, when you want more you can hit me up

Just like Clinton does, sure that every nigga does
She don't want to do it then give her something to get her buzzed

And don't be stepping to be, or you will definitely be resting in peace if your swinging that way, I ain't your boyfriend

So they sendin' these threat messages to me just to scare me
They see I'm very capable of being legendary

Then lie to the cops wit a straight face
Then right when you thinkin' that shit is just perfect
Hop would take it outta some rappers who didn't deserve it Just to make me feel better, send threatens and kill letters
To every rapper who I think is droppin' a ill record (Pow!)

OH! Whats up wit my stomach?


Excuse me sir wheres the restroom?
Excuse Me sir wheres the restroom?
I have to use the restroom (Find the way, nigga!)

Ehh, MCs tryna roll on opponents
Just to boost up they career when they old and Corroded
I got plans don't be thinkin' that your flow will decode it
It's my spotlight and I ain't lettin' go of the moment
And if you really feel you've had it, You want the mic so bad Well motha fucka I suggest you come and snatch it! (Aaah)
Even if you did it wouldn't make a difference
'Cause the people you tryna attract ain't listenin'
These bubbly wubblys suddenly buggin' me
Stomach be rumblin' mumblin' when I have to confront MCs
It troubles me but the honeys be lovin' me
Some will be fiesty, but in the end I'ma feel on her double Ds
I'ma have to end this dang song pretty soon
And I ain't sayin' it just to be cool I really do
For real man, all my dang time is runnin' out

Your the girl I be dreaming of
Alright that's cool

It's like you turn me to a better man
The times that we spend together sometimes I just wish they'd never end
You make me want to settle in
Shit, I be thankful keeping our relationship with each other as just a friend
I'm complete now that you came along
You made me whole
Your spectacular beauty is 'bout as great as gold

You'll never know what you do to me
And I'ma always be happy just as long as you cool with me
Forget those women that I used to like
I'm wanting you up in my life so baby let's make it you and I
We could find a place to chill
And I'd be lying to you if I said that I couldn't explain the way I feel

I'm just being real
You get me hyper, I think I need my pills
I wanna be the man that's taking you out

So shorty dig it, you come one of a kind
And when I'm chilling up at my crib you just run through my mind
You the only girl that's up in my rhymes that's not being dissed
What could be better than receiving this?
A track made for you specifically
Not just so you could get with me
So you could understand how my feelings be
I act like nothings going on when you ride with me
But deep down inside it be eating the fuck outta me
And honestly, I just gotta be honest with you
I ain't been the same ever since I was caught up with you
Just let me know if I be bothering you
I leave from outta your life
Hop in my ride
Push, and be outta your sight
But my heart would probably blow up
Shit, but so what
I can't hide the fact that your the girl I like so much

Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl

I'm finna explain the reason I'm liking you, so listen
Most women choose not to kick it with me but you was different
Now understand what I'm saying now
You even hang around me when your girlfriends ain't around
That's the type of stuff I think about
But I keep it inside
You ain't the kinda girl that'd just go use me for a ride
You do it 'cause I'm the person you feel like being with at that time
And I ain't even got a problem wit' it, that's fine
But I just want you to know
That I don't want you to go
And if you leave, I want you even more
But I'll probably be hurt worse
I feel like my life has hit the dirt
But that's just the way that the earth works
I wish I hadn't of wrote the first, second or third verses
To this song
And wish I was the first who was gone
I been trying this hard to keep it a secret
But you the only girl up in this world I wanna be with

Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl
Girl I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, I just need your love (Oh girl)
I just wanna be wit' you I hope you never leave
Please don't go and pick another man instead of me
'Cause you're the woman I be thinking of
I be dreaming of, so be my girl

Simon Says (Freestyle),UnKnown,2017.0,"Yeah, niggas better lay low, I swear this ain't no game bro
Asking for blessings won't prevent you from being preyed on
See I ain't underground or commercial, I'm in the grey zone
I had bars back when Verizon was making payphones
Niggas say that Hop fell off, I'm yelling ""How, stupid?""
Y'all ain't never eating but verbally making bowel movements
Better bow, you in the presence of wild 'coon shit
Fuck y'all, you gave me the mic knowing I'll lose it
My style's too sick, boy I've been programmed with pro raps
All these niggas' tinder as fuck but still no match
I'm a nice guy but when I'm in front of the notepad
Let's fuck it, dawg, off with his head, shit it'll grow back
How you claim to be ill when your career ain't never seen a sequel
Niggas ain't playing you in they Beats Pill
I could touch lives through the speaker, 3D skills
Stop it boy, I'm on a roll like TV film
I remember niggas didn't fuck with me, dawg
The tables turned, now we're even, damn, what are the odds?
There must be a God, you fuck with the ugliest broads
Your hands out, it better be for a lovely applause
Otherwise do not bother
Undercover Prodigy, how could I not prosper?
I am the godfather, style's beyond proper
Fuck you little lame ass wannabe Hop bloggers mooching off Hop's dollars
You niggas ain't shit, you wish you were shot callers
So y'all can get fucked like I do at massage parlors
I'm in and out the Matrix, shit I utilize both
The Grim reaper, you and I know
Will you survive? No
Once these whack MCs find out I crucify souls
They'll be calling the number on Logic's suicide song",https://genius.com/Hopsin-simon-says-freestyle-lyrics

Lil B's level is one, but your level it goes below that
Dont be so mad, Cause this is your fate

You think you cute cause you shit talkin and look tall
Nigga your neck looks like you swallowed a football
Fuck yo dick my cock is a foot long

And I'll be up at your funeral widda suit on
Next to ya momma who suckin' my dick behind yo tomb stone
You got no time for diss tracks or broke computers

Hopsin Freestyle - Sway In The Morning,UnKnown,2013.0,"Man, im so unprepared, and the shit is not fair
I hate rap, I hate my life and I do not care
I got a lot of fucking money, I do not share
I like to eat apples and I like to eat pears
I'm rare, I wear white contacts you see this
You see this fucking dick inside my jeans girl you need this
Oh, who's this? He's Hopsin with the cold flow
I get a lot of videos done by George Orozco
I'm on Instragram talking to the bitches
You diss me and then im coming with the quickness
To rip your ass to pieces, just like some fucking paper
Im spittin' on this microphone, and yeah you feel vapor
Uh, some niggas say I'm Darth Vader
Fuck it, yo I'll see you later
I'm out this bitch, and then I'm back in, I'm rapping
Yo dawg, what happend?
My brain is about to lose this shit, see im a lunatic
I don't even know who you are, yo who is this?

West Coast Eclipse,2012's XXL Freshman Mixtape ,2012.0,"When I rap, I like to seem wack at first
And rhyme cheap words, like curse and verse
And once it passes like one or two bars
I turn the switch on and start crushing fools hard
Who said the west isn't consistent, I'm fixing to fix it
For all these niggas who listening and living imprisoned
I'm thinkin' it isn't missing it's villain, killing them image
Now I'mma rip this, now witness it as I finish the sentence
Losing hip-hop was a tragic loss but I found it and glued it right
To my dick so if you want it you'll have to jack it off
Rappers acting soft as a fabric cloth, I'mma smash 'em all
Their nuts are like berries, mines are the size of basketballs
I choke MCs out with a strong vice grip
Then beat them with the sticks from the cross that they hung Christ with
Head to the club then pull me a sprung white chick
You all know how Hop gets down, he one nights it
I sleep walk at night with a bunch of madness
Mob through the halls and talk with a Russian accent
Ready to kill like I'm a real thug assassin
Who beat my dad's ass and wake up like nothing happened
I'm ruthless, and I do drop bombs
I got fools in the valley like, ""Dude, nuh-uh!""
When my album drops make sure that you cop one
We need a raw fool like me since 2Pac's gone
Wack rappers like, ""Hop, I'll disable you in the booth!""
I'm like, ""For real? That's a fatal attempt to do!""
You thinking you spit the truth, I shake you and strip your jewels
Then hang you up from a roof, and strangle you with a noose
Cremate you with four torches, flame of the torch scorching
Leaving your corpse tortured of course it's hardcore shit
And if there's ever a day that my pockets hurting
I'm robbing you, with a Osama Bin Laden turban
Hip-Hop is urging for a new flock of verses to rock the circuit
All you flops emerging are pitiful, we did not deserve it
Your style ain't even worth the fame
It's watered down more than New Orleans during a hurricane
Your whole album was a verbal shame

Westwood Crib Session - Freestyle (2017),UnKnown,2017.0,"When I got the call to come up to Tim's, I couldn't wait to
Damn it, who let the ape loose? Fuck a cage, I'ma break through
Ghetto, still sipping grape juice, who should I put the flame to?
If you hand me the throne just make sure it comes with a cape too
The only nigga with shit on lock is Hopsin, it ain't you
When I'm up to bat man, my only option is Babe Ruth
I never give into you incompetent lame dudes
I buss you in your fucking head with a bottle of Grey Goose
And I done lost myself, be happy? I don't know how to
The sunny days that I forgot to cherish are now blue
Nigga if you were me for while you would understand
If money doesn't change you, it'll change the ones around you
So I been ducking low, tryna hibernate and just find my way
I've been gassing, I gotta find the breaks 'til my mind is straight
I'm showing signs of hate 'cause I'm trapped in a darkness I embraced
Look me in my eyes, you could tell I'm ready to die today
If you see me then don't come over
I can't control my actions or emotions, the Devil's got the remote control an'
Style is cold and vulgar, got no composure
Defeating me is like tackling a juggernaut with some broken shoulders
So don't provoke, this is deadly and isn't user friendly
'Cause I own up to any truth you try to use against me
Since high school I've been known to be an abusive MC
I never stop the madness until I see you surrender
Welcome to Savageville, where shit ain't average
It's madness, imagine a pack a stragglers swinging from chandeliers
I'm in a Cavalier with a thot who drank a six-pack of beers
Getting road head and she's driving, the fuck is happening here?
I ain't calm and peaceful, nah, my small cerebral
Is often evil, better hide like Doctor Jekyll's alter ego
Call your people, I'm mad as addicts who lost the needle
Don't buy my album because it's all illegal, too off to be on
I'm talking Sméagol, I launch torpedoes, bitch, I'm the dirtbag
That ran up on wearing a Purge mask when you got your purse snatched
Here's your one way ticket to Hell in first class
Y'all all be making my nerves spaz, my word craft will make you disperse cash
I'm the special ed nigga you ignored, y'all the motherfuckers that I do it for
When I step inside the booth I'm lighting everything on fire like I was the Human Torch
Whooping ass, kicking through the door, spewing gore, breaking windows of your new Accord
Anyone who ever left better not be coming back to try to build a new rapport
I'm wild rude, a foul dude, I prowl through
I step on the mic and all the sudden my bowels move
Catching bodies? I'm 'bout to
I'm the one you should bow to, you niggas is ass, trash, cow poo
Style's based off pure vengeance, I'm a fierce engine
You'll get rear-ended, there's weird tension, my peers sense it
I'm a feared misfit, a geared henchman, you scared senseless
It's tear-drenching, but you'll be hooked after a mere sentence

The only one who tells me what to do is me
I'm past basic, in my eyes I have made it
Came along way from mom and dad's basement
When I do shows now the women strip me half naked
My bad language got me buzzing like I'm mad famous
Now labels think about signing me, damn
MTV has got their eye on me, damn
Shoebbdy dobbey wow, I still ain't giving fucks
So if I hurt your feelings tell it to your diary
Nigga I'm so beast rhyming on cold beats
Finally shining without the diamonds and gold teeth
The high empire trying to bring firin on me
So I keep my guards up, when I'm tired I don't sleep

Fuck man that was all I had, that was all I wrote
But yo now I'm 'bout to choke
Choke like I got a fucking rock up in my throat
Nah not a cock up in my throat not a fucking homo

Happy Valentine’s Day Alyce,UnKnown,2014.0,"Yo
There's something that everyone needs to know about
There's a special girl her name is Alyce and yes we go out
I can't be with her at the moment cuz I'm doing shows now
So I had to do this shit the only way I know how
You set my heart right again I swear I'm always smilin'
If you ever down I'll hold you up like you were violin
Groupies reaching for my love but no I don't invite em' in
My heart is in your hands and that's the only place I like it in
I do believe you're meant for me
I swear to God this shit's a dream
The saying goes when you find the one you'll know it instantly
Way back in 2010 I've been known
But I was having trouble tryna get up out that friend zone
But it's O-kay cuz every treasure's worth waiting for
I thank the lord that I have you cuz I was filled with so much hate before
Shit I've been cheesing hard every single day on tour
I gotta stop that shit though, for real my face is sore
For real Alyce, it's like you changed me to a new guy
I never felt the urge by a woman so much to do right
We gonna travel the planet through the Bahamas to Dubai
Any preference you like, we're gonna be in the moonlight
Living like death is foreign
Haters we'll just ignore em'
They get salty because we found happiness way before 'em
Baby we hotter than a whistling tea pot
And we don't need no outsiders telling us what we got, peace out
Girl you're so beautiful you're looking like a goddess
But still you always humble and stay modest
You ain't digging in my pockets
You got your own money up inside your wallet
Girl you so fucking bad you need stop it, I just
Feel like I need to fly away with you baby
No other girl can ever take what you gave me
Will you be my Valentine? Baby let me know
We go together perfectly, the Cancer and the Leo, yeah!
I ride for you like a soldier
Baby all you gotta do is give me your love, yeah
The world can get to know us, show love
If you'll be my valentine

Happy Valentine's day Alyce. I hope you like this. Sorry I can't be there, I'm on my tour but, just letting you know that I'm thinking about you, and I want the world to know as well. Peace",https://genius.com/Hopsin-happy-valentines-day-alyce-lyrics
The Hop Train,Haywire,2009.0,"Mama, can you buy me some white eyes?
Hop on the hop train, hop on the hop train

Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

Knock, knock, open the door
I came to sabotage all of your brains
I don't necessarily have a cause
Straight out of the fucking studio next to my dad's garage
Up on the Macintosh
Whippin' up my rap collage
I got some motherfuckers hassling me
Because I made it off of rap and not a bachelor degree
I plotted my plots accurately
During that time I was gone for a minute
Now I'm back in the streets
Fuck you haters I've been like this since before you was out
And I'm that psycho rapper that your label warned you about
Should I wait for you to blow up
Or should I torture you know
And do I have a heart for sympathy?
Of course I do, pal
You got a deal?
That's kinda strange to me
'Cause see you ain't really a thing to me
But see me, most niggas can't compete
Now bang the beat
And lets give them what they came to see

Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

I got all of you under my mind control
With nobody leaving until I say it's time to go
I'm single so I'm trying to find a hoe
A raw bitch, with a mean overbite like a dinosaur
You can gurgle on a nut or two
I'll never fall in love with you
See I got love for you
But I know you'll blow it on other dudes
And if I brought you home to my parents
What would my mother do?
Probably tell me to take your nasty ass to another room
That's why I'm taking you to motel 6
If you don’t like the way I’m stylin' on you, oh well, bitch
Oh, you're mad because every nigga treat you just like that
Well, you were the one at the fucking club dressed like that
Now, hmm
I think you might have lost it
You look nothing like a boss chick
Me, I'm trying to get my fucking balls licked
Let's flip a coin, head or tails, you call it

Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

I failed to listen
Corrupted from watching television
Go buy my album, fuck the clean, get the hell edition
Rapping like a maniac has put me in a swell position
If you met me in person you could tell I'm tripping
I never had a lot to lose, just a lot to gain
Always brought the pain
'Cause my mind is in the proper frame
While lazy niggas try to kick it like a soccer game
Talkin' like they gonna cop a range
But ain't got the change
I'm having a fucking ego trip
Because hip hop needs to reload quick
So look me up in the lab tight with some Doritos chips
And some emo chick
I'mma show you niggas how to be more sick
Check it
Yes, I'm from the west
If that's what your guessing
Let me teach you a lesson and show you the proper essence of wrecking
Dissecting the track is the only thing on my mind when I step in
When I follow those procedures I can label you as pathetic

Oooh, Hop on my train
I can take you anywhere you wanna go
And if you don't wanna leave we're goin' round and round
Baby all you gotta do let me know
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?
I'm a little bit torn up, can you hear me?

You wanna record deal
Wanna blow the fuck up?
Well good luck

Yo, this rap game is shady
It's trifling what they did to me
Took away my whole fucking life
And then showed no sympathy
They'll trash you in a blink of an eye for another entity
And I always thought that me and this music shit were meant to be
Everyday I sit alone in a dark room mad at my fucking career
Just hoping it starts soon
So I put these white contacts in that I go berzerk wit'
Then wild out on rappers who made it that don't deserve it
I needed cash so I signed over my soul to earn it
I'm writing flows dead as I lay in a hole of curses
They promised fame, I ain't spend five minutes on the surface
My life is supposed to circuit
I'm trying to hold my purpose
I'm writing the dopest verses inspired and so assertive
But I'm broke as fuck
Washing my laundry with no detergent
They said Hopsin your the best MC
The next big thing to blow up from the west indeed
Bullshit!

Tracey’s Stalker,Emurge,2003,"We all got that special someone in our life, ha I know I do
Shoot, but sometimes things don’t always go the way you plan
And that’s when I get mad, and I don’t like when I get mad
You won’t like when I get mad, we won’t like I get mad
Here’s a song I wrote, and it goes like this:

Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

You make my life so whack
One day my mind go’s snap
Blew up like nitro gas, call me a psychopath
Yup just like your dad
Accept I don’t need the alcohol to make me put a scream mask on and give your house a call
And I don’t give a fuck about the law
Cause you won’t have fingers to dial up the cops I just found my saw
I had enough of you and that’s about it
You make me so mad, I don’t get angry I cry and laugh about it
I’m not the one that’s up at your house every other day
That’s knockin at your front door hard and then runs away
I’m the one with the fucking blade
The one that’s at your front door making your ass scream “put the gun away”
And I’m the one up on your roof that’s right
With a new flashlight
Watchin the shit that you do at night
And I don’t care if you ain’t coo with it
I’ll cut your face off stitch it to mine then murder bitches so they think that you did it

Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

Oh you think that I be creepy?
Look out your window bitch, you’ll probably see me
Then get your fucking face shot with BB’s
I’m from the ghetto I know how to mug you
Show up on the spot and cut you
And if I beat your ass its cause I love you
You fail to see that
Whore I’m clingy? Don’t be telling me that
You kissing him? Damn right this is a jealous-y act
I’d rather fuck with you instead of relax
But when I’m done you can bet I’ll be back
Bitch defending my pack is way crazy
You make me stay angry
You gonna be in love with me?  Okay maybe
I don’t wanna turn this into the worst disaster
I wanna live happily after, chilling with hella laughter
But you like the man on some crack
This shit led to the macs
You lucky that you ain’t got hit in the head with a bat
I’m already knowing I’m sorta psycho (Haha)
But you won’t ever find another dude who loves you more than I do

Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

I used to make you nice old songs
Now it’s the psycho songs
Cause I’m the dude you don’t like no more
I was a nice a guy years a go
Now you make me miserable
I had to put this shit up on a track to let these niggas know

Why do I feel like, the police are watching me
There’s nothing you can do to me
Why do I feel like, the police are watching me
You don’t have to look past it’s me

We have subject Marcus Jamal Hopson in custody now

Man!

Bring him to the station, Doyle! Now!

Aw, man
You watch Tracey, you won’t get rid of me
I don’t care how hard they try
How far you hide
I know where you live, what car you drive (Hahaha)
This ain’t the start of the end
You gonna see Marcus again, there's no arguing friend
I’m gonna be given you prank calls from the pen

Yeah, right!

Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
You ain’t got no privacy
Girl you should feel like, somebody’s watching you
Don’t be tryin to hide from me

But I love you",https://genius.com/Hopsin-traceys-stalker-lyrics

Press Charges,Emurge,2003,"In the night, Inside your home
There lies a boy who's oh so cold
Traveled far along this road
To take the soul
Of a bitch so heartless
I'mma make you pay for the heart that you stole from me
I think she might press charges
I don't think that the cops can take full control of me
Shoulda never fucked with Marcus

Wow, You really are a ho, You finally got the kid convinced
Listen, Bitch. I don't have to make no freakin' sense
And only think I'm gettin over is your picket fence
Last time we saw her was Saturday, She's been missing since!
Hmm, Maybe 'coz I stole her
That ho was bipolar
I'm sick of skank ass bitches fuckin' my life over
But I dont hit girls, I sexually knock 'em up
She cheats on me, I chop her up
FedEx come and box her up
Me sayin ""Screw you, Don't call me again"" is not enough
I'mma make you and your family suffer from alot of stuff
Don't tell me to tone it down, motherfuckers, I gotta cuss
We'll never reunite, there's nothin' left I got for us
What hurts the most is your family knew you were playin' me
Everything we had was make believe
I can't believe
I fuckin' trusted you
I shoulda never fucked with you
Now you're gonna suffer the consequences, sucks for you",https://genius.com/Hopsin-press-charges-lyrics
Doo Doo Pants,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now I was in the club with a fine ass chick
 (Fo' Sho')
A bad bitch that was making that ass dip
Then I accidentally let some
 gas slip
I realized I had to take a real bad shit
So I said shorty, I won't be able to sext you
I really gotta to make my way to the restroom
I found a spot I could pop a squat
But I was blocked by some niggas tryna' pop n' lock
I was pooin' everywhere tryna' stow through the club
I just kept cool acting like I didn't know what it was
When I got to the bathroom, I twisted on the door knob (fuck)
The doors locked (shit) oh god
, 
I started banging till' someone yelled yo' stop
I shouldve never ate my moms fuckin' porkchops
Then I shitted in my pants (say what?)
And some niggas thought I was doin' a dance that I made
[Hook:}
Now do this dance called doo doo pants
And drop that shit to the flo'
Now drop that shit to the flo'
Now drop that shit to the flo'
Drop that shit to the flo'
Drop that shit to the flo'
Drop that shit to the flo'
Drop that shit to the flo'

Its about 10:45 and im ready to ride
But first I got somethin' to do
(and whats that?) I just gobbled a big mac
A bag of sour patch and now its time to take a dook
Aye yo Hop (whats up?) wheres the bathroom man? (why?)
My nigga, you should already know (know what?)
Ive got a monster in my tummy, its about to get ugly
Motherfucker (what?) im about to blow
I can feel it pokein' out like a nipple
Its drippin' down my leg (eh) now its official
I'mma need a double XL, some sprain a fanta, open the window
Lots of tissue, and a very large can
For a very large dump, its turning in my gut

"Pillowman, Pt. 2",UnKnown,2020.0,"Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem

Once upon a time there was a boy named Mr. Pillowman
He had enough rage bottled inside to even kill a man
And always went out of his way just so that he could get a friend
He'd ask for opportunities but nobody would give a damn
And he would always hope he made it, cause he was so creative
But he was slowly hated going through these dopey mazes
He'd never hesitate whenever a test was given
He'd pass it with an A+ but get no recognition
At 19 years old he thought he caught his break
And understood that patience and motivation is all it takes
His mother was so happy for him that she bought a cake
I wish you could have seen the smile on his father's face
Two days after that, he was feeling lost and dazed
The man who was suppose to be his hookup was talking fake
Now this is oftly strange, his world is cloudy as it softly rains
As he's crying out loud, his heart would sing...

Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem

Mr Pillowman. Nothing but a civil man
Always felt that his success was just around the riverbend
He'd smile in your face but down in his heart he'd be sad
The world would never acknowledge half of the talents he had
22 years old he thought he caught his break again
Because his buddy hooked him up, and it's for surely thanks to him
That Mr. Pilloman, is happy and so proud of his life
Wow this is nice, it's like he felt the power of Christ
He knew that God is good and God is bold, It's time to Rock and Roll
Somebody finally understood he was a pot of gold
His lack of success was to the point where it's gotten old
But patience was the key, so the stories often told
...Then his buddy called, and said ""I hate to tell you
But that connection that I hooked you up with never fell through""
Then Pillowman's like ""What the hell dude? You said this was a swell move
I'm probably better off trying to sell shoes""

Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem

Here's a secret. I am Mr. Pillowman
Going on 25 and I'm wishing I could live again
I've reached out to people but yet nobody would lend a hand
I feel like i'll never be able to pay my rent again
I'm getting old and time is crucial, feels like I'm not as useful
My only meals consist of Kool-aid, and Ramen noodles
...I wish I had more, but my mom and dad's poor
So when you see me don't bother to ask me what I'm mad for
..Yeah you can laugh about it. But I'm just sad and pouting
Seeing motherfuckers make it who don't have no talent
That's 10 years of my life that's down the drain
I feel like a true failure living life without a brain
But yo, I'm still trying to get a name
Rapping on the mic and spitting flames maybe i could get some change
But I'm at the point I'm about to say ""fuck it""
Cause I released a nationwide album and I never made a buck from it

Mr Pillowman, you can sleep on me. And i'll fulfill your dreams
I'm the
Pillowman, you probably heard about me. I'm more than what I seem",https://genius.com/Hopsin-pillowman-pt-2-lyrics

Don’t Act Like You Know Me,L.A.U.S.D. Result,2013,"Yo, I got something to say
To all my homies out there
Every single last one of 'em

Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me

I been through a lot of shit (yup), nah I ain't proud of it (uh-uh)
Most of the time you won't even hear a word out my mouth of it (nah)
Jail time, fat pregnant bitch, getting outta shit
Conning nigga, special ed school kicked out of it
Suicide'll moves plus I was diagnosed with
Something called ADHD and psychosis
I prayed to God, Jesus Christ even tried Moses
I'm a grown man and don't know what my goals is
 in front of the crowds then start smiling
Then go home turn out the light to start crying
Acting like I'm cool but really my heart's frying
Getting to the point I want niggas to start dying (FUCK!)
Thinking I'm the illest MC and I'm hot
Pretending that I'm feeling your style, but I'm not
Talking about my own best homies non-stop
Rapping is it for the fine girls love Hop, man

Don't be acting like you know me

Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half
And not the whole me

I haven't been through a lot of shit, relationships, colleges
Have a happy home 'cause my parents steady hollering
Raised with no money had to struggle for a dollar rent
Eating foods like Vienna sausage's by the can
Women not dating me 'cause I ain't acting like a man
Then the next day I walk around acting like I am (How you doin'?)
I be faking like I got feelings for none of 'em
When really every time I meet one I fall in love with 'em
Beatboxing, being robots to get attention
Everything is been true of all the shit I mention
End of every high school year I get extensions
Just so kids can clown me and I could be in detention
Homies getting on my nerves who act like they're the bestest
But if I get a record deal, their asses getting left quick (Peace!)
Now most of y'all niggas probably hate me
Shit I'm showing you the real me
It's time to stop the fake me

Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half

I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half

Gone been through a lot of shit, yeah I am proud of it
Ill flow, sick ass beats nobody stopping me
Niggas always told me I was wack and never got to me
They never in they life gonna be as real as Hopsin be
I put my heart, sweat, blood and tears into this rap
Stay in my life throughout the years until these cracks
Just a week ago until you ease and call me wack
I don't give a a fuck I know the kinda shit that I pack
I'm skipping over my tracks 'cause I don't rap batter
But how the 12 gauge I'll make a nigga back shatter
Even his ass packed up but could see me crack splattin'
You thinking I'ma switch my style, nigga won't happen
In this rap game I don't play kid
I fuck around and get my ass wasted
Tryna spit some fake shit
So let me ask you something ""What y'all know about Hopsin?""
Nothing, you just know I always drop hot shit

Don't be acting like you know me
There's a lot of shit I hear up
Even though you've been my homie
I ain't saying I'm an OG
I'm just saying that you've only seen half

When I whip your asses for failing me in all my classes

You never answer my questions you pantomime
As a matter of fact bitches, fuck a Stanford-9
Why should I take it man, it's worthless
That's why every time I take it I always fail it on purpose
Like I'ma waste my energy, tryna pass it

I'm telling you man, one day I'ma just 
And shoot it towards the teacher and crack his dome open
Break the locks in the door just so it won't open
Stomp his fuckin' face in until his nose broken
I'm one hundred percent serious, no joking
Fuckin' teachers try to act like they reaching out
Then they gon' talk about my ass in the teachers lounge
I went up in there, went blasting every teacher found
They'll get they head bashed in 'til blood is leaking out

God nappy headed afro
No one can hang with me

I feel like every move I make is gon' be wrong
It’s like I don’t belong
I’ve never been in prison
But you’re thinkin’ that it won’t be long
Supersquar wrote this song
Sometimes I fell that when you stare me
You wish that it’s a noose I was chokin’ on
You treat me like a reckless dummy
Show no respect of me
I can't even take a breath
Without it changing your perspective of me
You always think that you're a step above me
My gear is fresh;
You think I'm dressing ugly
Guess it's just the essence of me
And I don’t know if I can take it
I can be on the block
Without being under surveillance
I hate it
And everywhere I go
I’m like a motherfuckin’ problem
'Cause everywhere I go
These niggas think I’m gonna rob them
Damn!

Hey Mr. Blackman
God, nappy headed afro
No one can hang with me

Cops always see me think my 
Cavity searches whenever they see my crew comin’
Now I’m locked up
And I ain’t even do nothing
Can’t even get a decent meal
I got to chew rubbish
My girlfriend's white, her parents
Think I might hurt her
See I’m a nice guy
They treat me like I’m Ike Turner
They think I like murder
Like I'm a night lurker
Sayin' I don’t think this fucking guy is right for her
Can just live without getting judged
So I can live happily?
So what do I got to give
So I can get love
Im trying to be family
See I'm running like an athelete
Calling me to have fashy feet
This shit is bogus
I’m hopeless
When you grew up in a nice house
I was living with the roaches
I just need to focus
I know this
But how do I approach this?
Women lust for the roaches

Thank the god of brothers for giving life to obnoxious suckers
My thoughts are fucked up, corrupted from never being signed
Seven years of spittin' and somehow I never seemed to shine
But now I got my deal, plus I got my pockets filled
I bought a box of skills and beyond me that usually I conceal
But now it's mandatory, pop some white eyes in
So niggas can’t ignore me even though they think this man is corny
Think what you wanna, I'm thankful that I'ma great performer

Man whose dog is that?
Somebody better put a chain on his ass, man

I'm a genius up on the mic when I spit flows
I may be a retarded nigga but I'm sick though
Still the same small lid nigga with the big nose
Think you can hang with the pros
Man get yo
You want to go running mouth because the kid's hot
You should just go out and find something other than hip-hop
I'm just trying to do what I do I'm not trying to get shot
Niggas always hating and making me fucking flip, ahh
I told you over and over that I don't like you
Then niggas want to wonder why I turned into a psycho
All this shit has got me feeling like I'm suicidal
You think I'm stupid you'll be surprised at the shit that I know
And I'm so wicked when I'm kickin' and spittin' shit that I'll be off of the motherfucking hizook
Hopsin is rockin' and droppin' shit all the time and if you don't believe him, go take a lizook


Nigga get the dog
Niggas have to go and make me angry
I'm pretty sane but I may seem crazy
Ain't no way in hell I'll let these fake g's bait me
I'm a straight monster, somebody please save me
A lot of you rappers coming up with that fake shit
I'm here to put an end to it nigga so face it
I haul my black ass up cause I'm ain't going to take this
I'm on some other type shit while y'all still on the basics
Hop's got it locked and ain't nobody stoppin' him
All these sick kicks that I'm bluffin' I got a lot of 'em
Feel free to call my name if you got a problem
Or put your fucking hands up if you wanna rock with 'em
Somebody better take control of this dog
Before I cock something back and put a hole in this dog
A hole in the stone
Leave his ass cold on the floor
Man this dog don't know who he fucking with yo",https://genius.com/Hopsin-dogs-lyrics
AOL Shut Down,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Man, I don't know what the fuck these dudes are tryna diss me and shit, man
They ain't even on my level and they ain't never going to be on my level
I ain't even gotta try that hard, ya know what I'm saying
They put their fullest into their disses and shit, and I just fucking go shit some now real quick, you know, it's that easy
They will never be on my level, and I'm speaking the truth
They know it, they might deny it, but they fucking know it deep down inside
Their mom and dad know it, their homies know it, my homies know it, we all fucking know it. They ain't got one hit song, they mixtape all their shit, my shit is all original, my beats
Just keep it real with this shit, I ain't try to be like nobody else
Yeah they say I try to be like Eminem, I'm just my doing what the fuck I'm doing
They never see nobody do that shit before
They're fuckin' getting jealous, 'cause their shit is just bullshit, know what I'm saying?
But for all you motherfuckers out there who thought Hopsin wasn't gon' make his comeback, man, what comeback, I ain't never left!
Fuck you language arts, Wicky Rosco, whatever the fuck your name is, fuck you Chops, and fuck you Perez!
LET'S GO!

So I sound like Eminem, okay now
Go ahead and lie say you didn't jock Soslay style
Talkin' all that shit, sayin' I'm on the shelf
Listen to your ass bitch, you describing yourself
Man you wish you was me, but y'all ain't like me
You out your mind, thinkin' I'ma finna get ate by teens
I'ma put you in your place too, dissin' me just ain't cool
Rosco and Chops friends for life y'all some gay dudes
Y'all ain't no real recording artist with that wack rap
I'm better then y'all and I'ma DIE! over that fact
And I don't even know what hype these fools to push me
The day they eat me it'll be the day I grew a pussy
This shit is mine and I'll never give the game up
Especially to a studio gangster from Pennsylvania
Last time that I dissed lang he was filled with aches of pain
Now he coming back a year later then just change his name what? to Rosco what? Is he fakin'?
I could've sworn that motherfucking rap name was taken
Now what you doing man?
It's s'pposed to be a secret, plus nobody else take, noticed this so I'ma keep it
Plus nobody noticed that your sister is a freak bitch
'Cause I been talkin' to her myspaceing her every weekend
She wanna fly down and deep throat me up to I be skeetin'
That's all the bitch is good for so after that she'll be leaving
The bitch is just a motherfuckin' prostitute
Run up in your crib, and have me telling my ass not to shoot
And I'm a nice guy man, I ain't gonna rape your mama dude
I'ma put a gun to you and make you beat your momma's coot
You done fuck with the wrong fucking guy
This ain't just rapping, this is real fucking life, bitch
And Chop you think you're stopping me cuz
Listen to your shit man fix your quality up
Your mother fucking vocals are just super loud
I popped your diss in, and it blew my subwoofer out
Y'all think you slick with your hard on rap
Dissin' AOL rappers, when you are those cats
Man! All your music's just a big old lie
You based your rap career off what's happening online
How many damn songs you hear me share about these motherfuckers (NONE!)
'Cause I don't really care 'bout these motherfuckers
I don't collaborate with none of y'all 'cause actually
You ain't worthy enough to hop up on a track with me
Y'all trying your hardest while I'm having fun with this shit
Fuck the chatrooms, the battles man, I'm done with this shit
So, fuck all y'all, fuck all y'all
Fuck all y'all, fuck all y'all
Fuck all y'all, fuck all y'all
Fuck all y'all, fuck all y'all
Fuck all y'all, fuck all y'all
(stop, stop, stop it!)

Stop, cut it off, cut it off
I forgot somebody
Perez, you thought I was going to let you slide my friend?
Oh no!
Hit it! 
This is for México motherfucker!
You talk with me too much 'migo
I tried to told you 'migo once, but you don't listen to me!

Buenos dias, Perez, adios
Buenos dias, Perez, adios
Buenos dias, Perez, adios my friend
Buenos dias, Perez, adios my friend

Fuck me little, vato, I put you in the pothole
Don't you know fuckers take me, I'm coming from the barrio (dale oh!)
I'm crazy like the crazy guys
I'll just punch you in the face and give us just a lazy eye
I don't really know why you think you can beat me

Trust Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
Homie I ain't never had a hand out
Had to spaz out, till I passed out
In order to see the cash route
I'm killing shit just like the mad cow, disease
You wanna hustle, I'll show yo' ass how, believe
To the world my whole vision was a blur
Coming up never got the recognition I deserved
A diamond that was living in the dirt
The feeling really hurt
That's why a nigga had to go berserk
If you don't believe in yourself, no-one else will
Wasn't literally living in hell but it felt real
Had to chase the dream, to make the cream
And show the world that my momma raised a king, nigga
It's hard tryna find the right exposure
And times only running out as I get older
But everyday I get closer, and closer
The moment I blow up, I'm yelling I told ya
Prove the haters wrong, really motivates me
Got em all looking like ""No it can't be
He stunting on niggas, I hope it ain't me
Swagger looking cool, bout as cool as they see""
You're damn right it is, so mind your biz
Its time that you all know what grinding is
Looking like I lost my damn mind again
Its your boy Hopsin, and I'm signing in
Come on

Life at the moment ain't luxury
Niggas ain't never had love for me
Staring at me like ""Who the fuck is he?""
Trust me dawg, put your trust in me, come on
Ain't got time to be playing with y'all
When the competition, yo, I'm slaying em all
To come up as real, when you making it hard
But Imma keep rising till the haters disolve, you know

Yup
I finna advance
Its only right that I get my chance
You trying to take my spot, better sit back man
I'm bout to murder everything, that's a sick ass plan
You know
Nah, y'all ain't never paid no mind to me
You were way too busy denying it
Y'all know what time it is
Bout to feel my wrath
I dare y'all to question the skill I have
Its pretty obvious now
Gotta sick style
Pockets on wow
I know how to get down
Spotlights on, you know Imma show out
I'm already knowing that my momma so proud
The throne that I'm on, so great to be on
Glad that I got a fucking plate to eat on
I ain't a great yet, but I aim to be one
And when I am one, I ain't taking refunds, yup
You better write it down on a sticky note
That other nigga killing shit, is he really though?
Give it to me and Imma show you how to get it yo
You can't even see me up on vimeo
I know the struggle and how tough it get
When you not getting enough respect
Niggas thinking that I'm bluffing, shit
This is blood and sweat
And I'm going hard like I'm straight busting checks
You better recognise
When I rest in peace, my legacy won't be forgotten
My nigga you gon' remember mine
Haters thought they'd never see the day I ever shine
I'm the one my ex girl should have kept in mind
Nah, those days are gone but not forgotten
You should see the whip that I be hopping out in
I just started a new trend, you can watch it rocket
Now go and, ask about me boy, I'm bout it, bout it

Spillin the blood (only his verse),UnKnown,2010.0,"I'ma keep it really simple
Niggas already know when the flow is so sinful
Filled full of insults, I don't even need a pencil
Just give me a beat that's sick and a dope tempo
'Til you hate your life, but yet afraid to die
'Cause you don't know whats gonna happen when the lights out
I really recommend you niggas get it all together
So you don't need to worry 'cause it can happen right now
I can see why you're afraid of it
It's so spontaneous, living life is a crazy risk
Especially if you don't ever find god and you turn into an atheist
So many times I look up in the sky then I ask god why is it raining clouds on me
But I got a feeling that I’m talking to myself and there’s nobody lookin' down on me
Enough with the conscious rap, I'ma drop and bomb shit
You can all get racked, for talking crap
I soften cats on this mic, advice 'cause I'm a boss in fact
I'ma cause this track, to break down 'cause I got a flawless act
I killed this shit where's the coffin at?
Hoes get up off his back, around me balls get slapped
Man my CD has got to be the reason that I wanna go and squash MCs
I'm in the game but it's not for peeps, you watch and see
It's my turn, 2Pac's deceased, I gots to feast
On all these imposter G's, who run around thinkin' they can possibly

Get This Low,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm tired of feeling lost
Staring up at the ceiling wall
Hating the world, wanting to kill 'em all
The government is still the cause
And they conceal it all
From UFOs to planes making buildings fall
Stuck in a life that I ain't ask for
You're blowing up off of wackness when my level of skill is past yours
Crunch time has got my abs sore
And when I'm ready I'm hopping out of the matrix through the back door
I need some new shoes and a new shirt
My girl's mad 'cause I care more about music than I do her
No medic insurance and my tooth hurts
If you down then I'm down to just jump off a cliff and end it, but you first
My label got me feeling like I'm just a flop profit
Giving me limits, telling me my only market is Hot Topic
And they will not stop it, it's like they cock blockin'
And only meals I ever fucking eat is Hot Pockets

See when I get this low (low)
I wonder why my parents even bothered to have me (who knows)
I'm unhappy, never laughing, feeling crappy
I wish someone would run up and just stab me
But then again I don't want to die (no)
I don't want to lose my life
But at the same time
I won't pretend that everything's fine
You love your life but I hate mine

I hate my life
There ain't nothing I'm doing that's right
I really wish that I was dead and seeing the light
And all these things that always happen to me
They got me wanting to hang myself from my family tree
I've had it with me
I feel this way passionately
But I won't do it 'cause someday I'll blow up nationally
I've got these crazy fucking thoughts coming right out of my mouth
You say I'm never gonna blow up so I'll blow up your house
I'm gonna get ya
I'm gonna leave you still like a picture
It's Mr. Meanie Man and yeah I'm fucking coming to get you
I really hate myself but I just hate you some more
Your neck is like a stolen Honda 'cause I'm chopping a cord
And do you get it?
You know that Kombizzle is with it
I never come short, you know that I will never go midget
But if my life don't change quick then I will probably be dead
Oh fuck it, I just want to live and make this music instead

I don't want to lose my life
But at the same time
I won't pretend that everything's fine
You love your life but I hate mine

Life is shitty when you ain't got no label to fund
Any of the albums you release so you stay on the run
Looking for markets to promote you, there's basically none
And making one all by myself I'm not capable of
But still I try and we made a little something from nothing
But no money is coming in and I'm struggling, wondering
When the fuck will it change
Feeling stuck in the game
With no bucks and no change
Nothing but fucking complaints
And suicide ain't an option because I have a kid
And I want him to be proud of some shit that daddy did
So I just have to rip beats apart for cash to spend
Charging less than half of what I'm worth just to traffic them
There ain't no laughing, friend
This ain't a laughing matter
When you rapping, mastering mix, and do graphics after
And then press and promote
It's been stressful, I know
What's impressive is hope is the thing that gets you to cope

See when I get this low (low)
I wonder why my parents even bothered to have me (who knows)
I'm unhappy, never laughing, feeling crappy
I wish someone would run up and just stab me

Hopsin - Ill Mind Of Hopsin 5 - (Em Português),UnKnown,2012.0,"Man I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
Who walk around bumping RAW with the shit blaring
Saying ""fuck school"" and dropping out like a miscarriage
I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed I played a part in this devilish game
Making your common sense perish, but I ain't taking the full blame
Cause most of you chumps running around here ain't never had strict parents
All of your brain cells rotting from weed
You feeling like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You having sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets thinking you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead so you just follow the sheep
Making sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like ""Yeah, he got it from me""
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word ""fun"", what do you envision?
Probably drinking and smoking out with your crew
And chilling with clueless women you trying to bang, bumping New Edition
Is that all you think life really is
Well if so, then you're a fucking idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain; GIMME IT!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from bagging these hoes and packing a bowl
Well let me guess- No
You're only in school because your parents make you go
When all you do is play beer pong and hang out with your bros
Yo, society's got you living for a whack cause
You're a fucking adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw, you literally do nothing at all
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is ""I got money and it's stacked to the roof""
And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you
How? Your lazy ass don't commit to labor
You pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
Then you complain about your life cause it ain't getting catered
Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater
You wanna succeed, you have to try
Or one day you'll get older and regret it all cause you can't provide
Your friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice

Girls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo
Bitch that's a fucking lie
You always talk about how every man's fake
And you can't take it and you want something real
Shut up tramp, save it
Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
And head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking
Pulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making
Till you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
You want Romeo, then act patient
And stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
It's the club, where guys put on a new persona
After they get loaded with a few coronas
They always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of
Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry
Talking 'bout, ""Oh my god I can't find a guy
I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried
Why am I even on Earth? I should die""
You want Romeo, you're not worthy
You're cock-thirsty
You're nasty and probably got herpes
Sometimes the secret to finding is to stop searching
Try a new formula, cause your last one's not working

The term ""real nigga""'s publicly used
And I need to know what it means, cause I'm fucking confused
Are you one for always busting your tool
With nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew
Is it because you're selling drugs to get loot
And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
Like it's fun to be you
But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through
Nah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve
Cause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal
It's clear you can't stand the law, you're lost as an abandoned dog
And all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball
I can't even fuck with you, cause if we out in public
You gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too
You'll get old and be nothing
Living life in these streets, thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging
Look at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool
Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
Till you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
Your real nigga talk seems bogus
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
And his future doesn't seem hopeless
A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused

To all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
You inspired the issue I wrote about in this song
You go to prowl on the young who roam around in the slums
See this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
Hope the hour's long when I'm rolling out with your tongue
The man above is my guide, you know the power is strong
All you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese
And the mass control limit was breached - fuck hip-hop
They only in it for cheese, and any eyewitness can see
They purposely making the innocent weak
My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me
Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
It is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine
I can guide you if you feel blind
I just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mind",https://genius.com/Hopsin-hopsin-ill-mind-of-hopsin-5-em-portugues-lyrics

Sure enough to get to beat the woman I'm depending on
And I don't care if the girl sweet, like some cinnamon
I just wanna merk you one night, then I'm gone
Now, here we go, turn that shit up in the stereo
Loud now, wild out, let me know, you feel me, yo

That's why she gone now
She ain't coming home now
She up in my crib jumping on the bone now
Come here, girl, I wanna see you get
And I ain't talking about later, right

I wanna see you take it low to the flow, bro

Step over when you fuckin' around for me, girl

Break it down for me, girl, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
Break it down for me, take it down low for me
I said break it, break it, break it down-down

I got that dope shit, dope enough to smoke this
Roll up in the dope with homies got the toasters
The only thing you're close to, my ass, nigga
Better stay in your place whenever I pass, nigga
Like I'm high class nigga
Even though I'm not though
I'm still in the hood at the same spot, yo
Same spot with the niggas that make things pop, yo
I live a thug life but I ain't Pac, yo (Nah!)
I'm Hopsinister and I be as real as the
Nigga with the studio, knowin' when the trick is pushed
Better believe my verses, man
I spit fire like I was one of them circus men
G, you roll over Hopsin, of course, rocky you know what's poppin'

It Is What It Is,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Hopsin)

I'm a radical nuisance, and I'm back on my bullshit
Went from lashing on ruthless to hanging rappers from nooses
You ain't gotta like me, but like a magnet and you stick
Breaking these niggas was easy like snapping a toothpick
Your whole gimmick's a fraud, you just casting illusions
That's how niggas get ran up on and cracked with a broomstick
Watch what my promo does to your whole buzz, you're dead
I don't show no love to homo thugs
My haters never show they face, they usually try to hide, but when they see me at my shows, I'm who they truly idolize. (I LOVE YOU!) I keep a handful of ugly groupies I deny, knowing if they ever showed up at my crib by surprise. (What the fuck?)

Niggas gonna recognize, we the coldest niggas  shit
(Huh?)
I been off for a minute, now I'm back in this bitch. I'm going off , bitch I been ripping this
(What?)
Any minute and I'm with it, come and get it cause I been killing it
(Uh-huh)
(Get it)
(Oh)
(It is what it is)
(I been up on this, I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)
(It is what it is)
(So bitch suck a dick, the kids busting sick. I'm a motherfucking selfish cat, quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)

Yo, it is what it is,  for the kids
Break into your crib and stick a fucking pen through your rib
I'll get you pinned to the fridge as I empty this clip into the cat and dog, and get to fucking busting like I'm jacking off
I laugh it off when it comes to the thought of death and shit
Got the angel and devil on my shoulder steady wrestlin'
Check inside your mom, you'll most likely find my specimen
My jizz will paint her face whiter than the forty second president
Quietly evident, popping medicine just to get me off
 and bungee jump with some dental floss
Hit from the back so hard, you see my penis is her jaws
Go deeper and give birth to myself while she in menopause
It's probably my potty mouth that got you mad, cause I'm a motherfucking grouch hopping in trash, and smoke 's ass
My dick's harder than jerking off with a doctor's cost, shot his ass, then hide in the same spot that 2Pac is at
(It is what it is)
(I been up on this, I'm a motherfucking selfish cat. Quick to walk on niggas like a welcome mat. Wassup?)

I'll mack on any chick I feel who got the cutest tits

Pants sagging cause they too loose to fit
I'm torcherous
Grab a hammer and nail for your front door and board it shut
I stare deep in your eyes, rip out your soul and absorb it up
And have Biggie Smalls yelling out ""call the coroner""
My groupies stay horny
They always call to say ""Hopsin can you fly me out to Cali? Please pay for me""

So lately I've been beating my dick with a pair of boxing gloves
I got the maddest rhymes, how dare yo ass deny?
I'll stab you in the brain with a knife, you can keep that in mind

Thats why I always make your chick holla
She called me big papa and she let everybody hit it like a pinata
And when I'm done I give her ten dollars

My haters ending up right position the fight intention that seems to make life a mission to get through
My story might seem a little crazy but it's true
I front on the public like shits cool
As if I had a meal to eat, I'm approached by a million freaks
Assuming fame is pleasure but that ain't quite how it feels to me
I changed a lot from the times I used to grab a pen and average in 4 or 5 verses a day
Damn it's been a while since I've been that hungry
How did I let the industry strip that from me
Things don't get that sunny
I put a lot of work in but I don't get back money
I had a decent label who would never risk crap from me
I feel trap mentally, shit the game has not got the best of me

I know you got a problem nigga, you don't wanna say shit
Cause you're a goblin and what's a goblin to Satan?

Decapitate your head and now you'll  dead

And walking it out, this is me chalkin' em' out
Witness provocative sounds, disses I'm tossin' around
Mission is knocking em' down, this shit is causing the drought
Isn't it boggling how, one nigga can be so dope?
But never get promoted, answer that, cause he don't know
And he's so broke, that he can't even eat no mo'
Behind on all of his bills, because his cheese don't grow
My life is usually harsh, I got a bruise on my heart
That's why my music is dark, I gotta do it its part
Of this reason that I was put on this planet we call earth

Yo, my name's Hop, it's not a secret I hide
See, I love rap music, I try to keep it alive
Same time I'm the nigga that all the people despise
'Cause I have to go commercial, their policy is to lie
Follow me, you'll inspire, we'll damage shit on the way
Slamming the older strings 'til I panic, hit on the brakes
Then crash in the open waist, smashing the shoulder blades
And gassing the motor sprays, 'til their asses explode in flames
Not a celebrity, never kick it on Beverly
Heavily dropping bombs, I'm breakin' it with no set of keys
I sever weak rappers who not on my pedigree
'Cause on a tombstone is as hard as your name will ever be
I hope you lockin' the doors, I'm an unstoppable force
I'm on fire, you cannot get the torch
I got a spot in the source, no I did not get endorsed
See I'm just doin' what I do and gettin' props in the course, you know?

I beat the fuck out of you, then beat it back in you
In a packed venue, stab your ass with a snapped pencil
Then stomp on your fuckin' spinal cords 'til your back's crippled
I'm iller than a flat chest bitch with fat nipples
And ash ripples who talks with a snag whistle
And claims that her crabs tickle, homie, it's that simple
I dedicate my life to come up with these bad insults
Drove to Young Money in a broke old whip
And jumped at Lil Wayne with a pogo stick 'til I broke both hips
Hop ain't takin' no more shit
I put you rappers in the chokehold quick
So you can go blow dick, bitch
Hop's a demon, my wild image is not deceiving
I spit like a slutty bitch who doesn't swallow semen
I like beefing 'cause I'm not a vegan

In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper

Nah, I'm not a rapist, some prefer the word sadist
I'm not a satanist, more like a psycho with problems is blatant shit
You're the reason I'm dangerous, tight jeans & stockings, inside I scream
Wet dreams, more like a tease, from this teen, knife to the spleen
You won't give it up to me, girl you actin Teila tequila
I think your ass been sippin' too many margaritas
Well it was nice to meet ya, and since I'm the undertaker
Its tombstone time, you stop breathin'
Hands to the throat, chokin', neck starts bleeding
The weapons done, and nah I don't own guns
But I've seen enough horror flicks to get you done, hun, sprung

So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding
In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper

See I was at home when I thought of a master invention
Change my image up for a girl to grab her attention
Hell I thought she would be bagged in an instant
But it didn't work out so I resorted to disaster intentions
It was like somebody handed me a bag of resentment
I ran up on her, pushed her on the ground and dragged her against it
I said ""Look bitch I'm not gonna hurt you or try to cut you
I just wanna love you"" and all she had to say was ""FUCK YOU""
I said ""No no, please don't make me angry, I'm gonna stab you
And make your veins bleed, you can ask my mother I'm a strange breed
Prematurely born, 8 weeks, I'm a nice guy you should date me
If I had you inside my life I would be so complete""
But she don't agree, she just said no and screamed
Woe is me, after what I did I have a right to be sore
All I can say is that she's not alive anymore!

So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding
In my mind still unwinding
I had to rip her, rip her, sick like the ripper, the ripper
In my mind we grinding, grinding
Still unwinding, I had to rip her, rip her
Sick like the ripper, the ripper

I came here to address these points, fools getting caught
Snobby bitches getting annoyed, so do you get the point?
Or are you too high off the joint? Girl
These stab wounds multiply in your world
Yeah, they all plural
I don't kill for the thrill, its for the nerds with the mills
Still but no ladies to chill, its ill
I don't find enjoyment, I find employment
Slice a prostitute in the loins quick
Moist grips, firmness, drooling from my lips
See the ripper can't be ripped, on his own shit
Self  yeah i ride my own dick

So in my mind we're fucking
In my mind we grinding

All Your Fault (Türkçe çeviri),UnKnown,2017.0,"Çok yoruldum
Bana açtığın problemlerden dolayı
İyi değiliz artık değiliz görebildiğim kadar
Beni aşağı tekmeledin, düştüm
Sürünüyorum, hepsi senin suçun

Fazla para, fazla problem
Şimdi lirik romanımı yazmaya yeniden geri döndüm
Bir bombanın üstünde duruyorum ve pini çekmemeye çalışıyorum
Cinleri içmekle ilgili düşünmeyi bitirdim
Çünkü belki bu sinirlerimi yatıştırır ve bu şarkıya odaklanmamı sağlar
Ben siktiğimin sınırındayım, kendimi kaybettim ve geri dönemem
Benim hiç sınıfım yok, son orospumun hareketinden sonra devam etmedim
O beni yıkmaya çalıştı, para akışımı iflas ettirmenin eşiğindeydi
Ondan çok nefret ediyorum, ismi mezarın üzerinde olabilirdi
Ölmemesinin tek nedeni çocuğumun yolda olması
Orospu hamile ve striptiz yapıyor, minimum Maaşlardan kaçınıyor
Beni yere tekmeledi, beni kilitledi ve Yüzüme tükürdü
Sırf biryerde tutmak için ona yüzük aldım
Baş ağrım büyüdü, Lanet olsun onu bırakmalıydım
Şimdi cennet gitti, ve de benim aşkımda ve asla geri dönmeyecek
Cehenneme hoşgeldin, sürtük, umarım yanarsın

Dinle lil zenci, aynı ayakkabının içinde değiliz
İsim kurmadın veya vergini bile ödemedin
Lanet olsun, bunun neye gittiğinden utandım
Ve eğer benim popülerlik seviyeme ulaştıysan
Garanti veriyorum kardeşin dame de yapmış olurdu
O yanlış tarafta, bunun için bana kızmayın
Siz onu benden daha iyi biliyorsunuz
Hepinizin ilişkilerinde hep kötü zamanlar oldu
Şimdi hepiniz bana şeytanın dölüymüşüm gibi bakıyorsunuz
Ama 5 yıl önce aynı diss şarkısını yazdın
Neden ağzından çıkarmıyorsun ?
Dünyaya kardeşinden de nefret ettiğini göster
Gerçeği göstermekten korkma
Puşt, kaybedecek çok bir şeyin yok
Herkes silah tutabilir, ama kim sıkacak kadar cesaretli?
Çok iyi biliyorsun ki o yağma toplama bağımlısıydı
Eğer benim gördüğüm boku görüyorsan, benim tarafımda saf tutardın
Ama sen ortadan kayboldun ve benimle yürümedin bile
Ve markan yere gömüldüğü zaman geri dönmek istiyorsun
Zenci, seni de dandik akli problemlerini de sikeyim

Çok yoruldum
Bana açtığın problemlerden dolayı
İyi değiliz artık değiliz görebildiğim kadar
Beni aşağı tekmeledin, düştüm
Sürünüyorum, hepsi senin suçun

Çok fazla orospu çocuğu hayatımı yargılıyor
Ve arbedelerimi seviyormuş gibi beni canavar çıkarıyor
Çok fazla orospu çocuğu yazdıklarıma burnunu sokuyor
Parlamamı görmekten nefret ediyorlar, ışığımı kesebilmeyi diliyorlar
Müziğimi halka açık bir günlük olarak kullanıyorum, bana ilham verende bu
Işte bu siktiğimin oğlunun bana neden hayranlık duyduğu, gel ve beni vur
Girdiğim cehennemle uzlaş
Sizi orospu çocukları işimde çok iyi olduğumu unutuyorsunuz
Şunu bilmeliydiniz, Bazıları çok geri zekalı ve aptal olduğumu düşünüyor
Bir gecelik gittim ve bir faaliyet başlattım
Parmak ucumdaki güç Ruthless ve Funk volume'den daha iyi
Ha ha, hala yeniliyorsun, siz zenciler bunu yapabileceğinizi sandınız
Git lağımda sürün, siz zenciler hiç girişimci değilsiniz
Hopsin nam-ı diğer hükümdara bulaştınız
Ve şimdi size siktirin gidin diye bağırıyorum
Şükürler olsun, bütün ayak bağları sonunda kesildi
Zenciler, taht benim, yani siktiğimin uzağında durun!

Phsycosis,Emurge,2003,"I'm sufferin' from psychosis
I can see that you see, but you won't leave me alone
Psychosis
Voices in my head, I'd rather be dead
It's psychosis

The child with many disorders in his head
Unlike everybody else
That's why nobody helps him, at all
He just did it by hisself

Nobody ever understands me
Psychosis runnin' through my head
Ah, psychosis
Oh, oh, psychosis

I'm sufferin' from psychosis
I can see that you see, but you won't leave me alone
Psychosis
Voices in my head, I'd rather be dead
I'm sufferin' from psychosis
I can see that you see, but you won't leave me alone
Psychosis
Voices in my head, I'd rather be dead
It's psychosis

Said it once I'll say it again
My life is coming to the end
Those people left that were my friends
Who thought I cared, but I pretend
This is now and that was then
I never  it can't happen
 I'm left in
What the hell is going on?
 where I went wrong
Well, well I'll be strong
Woah, 
Woah, woah, 

I'm sufferin' from psychosis
I can see that you see, but you won't leave me alone
Psychosis
Voices in my head, I'd rather be dead
I'm sufferin' from psychosis
I can see that you see, but you won't leave me alone
Psychosis
Voices in my head, I'd rather be dead
It's psychosis

I see you
You don't see me comin' from behind to kill you
I see you
You better run cause I'm comin' from behind to slit your throat
I'm coming for you!

I'm sufferin' from psychosis
I can see that you see, but you won't leave me alone
Psychosis
Voices in my head, I'd rather be dead
It's psychosis

All of us, all of us, all of us, all of us
All of us, all of us, all of us, all of us
All of us have it in us

Outta Ya Mind,L.A.U.S.D. Result,2013,"What the fuck is this... Marcus?
Your friends are calling me and saying that I gave you shit
What the fuck is that all about?
Alright, whatever, um  Well fuck that Marcus
Whatever, if you wanna call me back then call me back
But I'm pissed because I'm... 
About how you told them about me and how I'm a dirty fucking slut
And I'm a hoe and I fuck around with everybody
And you know that I fuck around with everybody
So whatever
Uh, guess I'll talk to you later or whatever the fuck you wanna do
 So bye
Ha, ha, yeah! Oh! Girl you must be outta your mind

Yo, yo, I would just love you,  you; have a lot of sex, bitch fuck you

That don't mean that a nigga gon' want you, want you
Get up out my face 'cause hoe you, getting on my nerves that's why I never chose you
Remember that I can find better snatch than yours, than yours

Had his dick chopped off  drop off

I know I'm everything you could want, you could want, oh!
But you ain't got what I'm looking for, looking for, oh!
So go and find another nigga and stop wasting my time
You must be outta your mind, girl

You the reason I get so violent; can't fix this with a kiss, don't try it
I don't even want your lips on my lips, all of your bullshit I just don't buy it
Girl, I don't wanna hear your whining, try not to commend your 
 But find another nigga to fill your body
Don't be tryna' act all stuck up, toughed up, what slut? You'll get fucked up
Run up on  but fuck you
Disgust you 
 (Shit)
Go and get another dick, here's a riddle for you bitch
 That you can't have at all (It's me)

I know I'm everything you could want, you could want, oh!
But you ain't got what I'm looking for, looking for, oh!
So go and find another nigga and stop wasting my time
You must be outta your mind, girl
(I know I'm everything you could want, you could want, oh!
But you ain't got what I'm looking for, looking for, oh!
So go and find another nigga and stop wasting my time
You must be outta your mind, girl)
Baby, I know I've been  in the past
But that's just who I am, and I ain't never gon' change
I'm sorry baby

Couldn't wait to play your ass like Halo 2
Thought I'd buy you things, I won't get a thang for you
Breath always kicking like you just ate tofu
Go get your little friends, what they gon' do?
Shame on you, you ain't able to
Turn the fellas on, that's why they ain't on you
So before you try to land by my way, listen to workout plan by Kanye
If you do or don't, I don't really fucking care
Can't explain how I feel 'cause there's nothing there
Listen girl, there's something I wanna share
I never took you out 'cause people were gonna stare
And I ain't tryna' ruin my reputation
I don't even want to be in that situation
And it ain't nothing that I'm special education
We never spent time, so there was no time wasted

I know I'm everything you could want, you could want, oh!
But you ain't got what I'm looking for, looking for, oh!
So go and find another nigga and stop wasting my time
You must be outta your mind, girl",https://genius.com/Hopsin-outta-ya-mind-lyrics
He Made Me Do It,Emurge,2003,"That's enough, had enough, sick of this drama
Temperature is high and it's finna get hotter
That's enough, had enough, sick of this drama
Temperature is high and it's finna get hotter
That's enough, had enough, sick of this drama
Temperature is high and it's finna get hotter

My mind is going to explode
If I don't get some self control
Not my fault, the Devil made me do it
Yo, you know the Devil? Yeah, he made me do it
I feel him deep within my soul
It makes me lose my self control
Not my fault, the Devil made me do it
Yo, you know the Devil? Yeah, he made me do it",https://genius.com/Hopsin-he-made-me-do-it-lyrics
