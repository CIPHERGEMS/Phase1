[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri &

]
Open up, open up
And let the funk flow in
From this nigga name J and his new found friend
I'm hitting switches like Eric
 on the solo creep
For yo jeep it's the B.R.A.T
Putting the dip in your hip from right to left
It's the ghetto ass bitch and I'm So So Def
Nigga that's my click, nigga that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fat shit
Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
With the real shit, we got the shit you can't funk with
(Why?)
Because we so funkdafied
(Why?)
We make you move from side to side
Well, it's da G H da E T T O, nigga
Brat and J.D. coming like that big baby
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimping
And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson

Puttin' it down, puttin' it down ain't no thang to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes the Brat tat-tat-tat
I got the shit to make your neck snap back
Meaning I got the shit that a get'cha bent
Tear the roof off this mutha like Parliament
I'm on a roll In Control like Janet, dammit
Brat, you're the funk bandit and they can't handle it
I know, that's why I keep hitting em with this grammar
Letting niggas know that I'm the real mama jama
Straight to the head like a chronic sack
[Verse 4: Jermaine Dupri & 
Da Brat

I pass the mic to the Brat
And yo I passed it back
Well, a sistas and fellas
It's time to get your groove on
I provide the funkdafied sounds that make yo move, homes
Breaking these fools off proper like
It's S.O. S.O. D.E.F. dynamite
Humunah, humunah, comin' up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we coming at cha

I got that shit all you niggas just love to ride to
Funk for your trunk is what I provide you
So slide through your hood with me in your deck
Cause your correct way to get your groove on, Flossin'
And I paid the costs to be the boss as a kid
Fucked around and made some shit you can't fuck with
They thought luck did it, but it didn't cause I'm back again
Back with the Big and my new-found friend

Sliding in from the front, never way behind
Niggas wonder how I came with this style of mine
Remain in your seats as I release the clip into yo' hip
Brat and Biggie Smalls...

Aw, shit!
On top of all that, 
I'm so, so
 remarkable
Flow to make you motherfuckers know
Ain't an MC coming close to touch
Bitches I like to fuck, guns I like to bust, so...

Lay on back (listen to the B side), light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want
Lay on back (listen to the B side), light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want

I never knew, niggas never had a clue
On who was the king of the street
Four deep in the Range Rover jeep, guns under the seat
And my nigga just came home from work release
Cristal in my lap, chronic in the air

Nigga, pass that shit like you just don't care)

Yeah, you on my shit list, Biggie burns spliffs

Didn't find nuthin but truth, in the hook
Be a pleasure to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die
I jumped in the Benz, took me a little ride
Round the mountain, broke a left, hit SoSoDef
And told that nigga JD I was the one, fuck the rest
We Funkdafied, kicking it live
Robin Leach teach a nigga how to really survive
Whether it be track or blunt, ain't no need to front

Love to watch the dough stack

'Till it get tight and fine

If he act right he could hit it from behind
We can bump and grind all night 'till we reach a climax
Make sure you leave a phat sack for Brat
Till you come back for more
Six pack surrounding my belly hole, it's tight
You ain't gotta tell me So
So Def is the way that I flow
Made to blow, pave the road
Unfadable, capable to save your hoe
Wherever I go, stack dough

Even know how to flip cocaine and when the funds is low
For the show stopper, this for the know nadas
Shit get mo' hotter, nigga holla my name
They follow me when I drivin' the Range
And wait for me to finish performing backstage
Never have a nigga yawning
When they keep up with the shorty
Weed pumping as strong as me

And make million dollar deals for Brat
And pay some of the bills for Brat
And just chill for Brat

Need to know how to surround a bitch with stability
Get down, bitches, if he feel me, rich now
I can't afford to sit down, get bored if
We got hits out nigga need big clout
Don't crowd my space if we dip out
Running with some other nigga face he don't trip out

Even got keys to the spot to drop the PO Box
And in the drawer when he find his underwear
I keep a fresh do rag in his hair

In the west-side district
Get it twisted
If you wanna choose your destiny
Leave all that simple shit at home
And bring your fuckin' best to me
Cause right here playtime stops
Okay, rhymes flop and all that real-deal shit hits tops
See I'm the cream of the crop, head bitch in charge
And there ain't nothin' or nobody that I've barred thus far
Repitoire full of wicked shit
Lay back kick a shit
All the right shit to give a nigga a hit

If you let's nuthing hold you back
And your limit is the sky
Throw your hands in the air and let's all get high
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lay back hypnotized to the funky sound
If you let's nuthing hold you back

Cause if we go broke you won't feel bad

Yeah. But there's enough hundreds for that to never happen in action

These synthetic niggas usually smoke refos with my peeps
Get deeper than any bitch
Watch me and yo' nigga creep
Sky's the limits, Damn them lights cause Krayzie got the Hydro
Inject a deadly venom grinnin' and watch them all die slow
We non-fictional characters carry grudges till it's dealt with
Underestimate the wrong bitch and get yo' shit spend
You better light a splife and mind yo' motherfuckin' business
Or get that ass put in the witness protection program
Till I'm finished, diminished
Your entourage is my level

Pushin' custom drop-tops
Keep Segante' in the glove box

As I commence to take flight its gotta be first class cuz this ass
Could give a fuck about coach....bitch
(How high do you fly when you fly Brat?)
From the bottom to top- top to bottom and back
Now as I lay me in the cut gettin' fucked up
Puffin on blunts and comin' up with some mo of dat funky stuff
Rough and tough is not enough to keep my focus
No its that hocus pocus abracadabra smoke just
Fills up the room as I breathe again
Once more from the ghetto its them braids and
When flossing in my Benz with my friends it begins
Smell the aroma puttin' you in a coma
Its dat super stinky dank that'll make ya faint go blank
Hey when I its the door all my niggas say

Oh How we love it when ya fire it up

Your averaged, everyday black surrounded, bar-b-que, a little weed
Its some niggas with some bass pounding
One o'clock is the time to raise
Take a shower brush my teeth and correct my braids
Now listen up to what I say because this type of shit, it happens everyday and
(I gotta place where I soak some so) In the summer its a pool
In the winter its a smoke hole
20 feet away from the house in the back
Surrounded by a gate draped in all black
(Its where me and my homies go smokin' on that dank 'till it ain't no mo)
How we smoke? (we smoke to the maximum)
Doin our thing kickin' back relax and um

Adi adi adi adi ah... (its probably all that chronic that I smoke)
Oh How we love it when ya fire it up
Adi adi adi adi ah...layin in da cut gettin real fucked up
Adi adi adi adi ah... (its probably all that chronic that I smoke)
Oh How we love it when ya fire it up
Adi adi adi adi ah...layin in da cut gettin real fucked up

We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby
(I pledge allegiance to the bags of marijuana)
We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby
We like to smoke, we like to smoke, we like to smoke baaaby

My self esteem is even higher when I'm walkin wit chu
You give me fire and desire like Tina Marie and Rick James do
I dont care burn up the minutes on the cell
Just turn up the music and feel it as hard as hell
I get abusive with the flow zone deep
When I seduce em they just wanna hold me

Yo presence makes everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the 2-way you lay your head on my pillow and do me baby!
The rhythm on ya get yo groovin baby!
And we can rock it till the broad daylight
Bodies knockin the boots destroyin property
Proppin me up to get through it ain't right
How ya feelin on my boooty It's just yooouu and me
Unexplanatory the way that you adore me
Lord have mercy somebody gon have to pray for me
I'm worthy my service superb
And on purpose im swervin all the way to your heart

Ghetto Love,Anuthatantrum,1996.0,"I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you had the answer
You told me to take a chance
And learn the ways of love, my baby
And all that it has to offer..
You told me your secret love won't let you down
Ohh allll my love baby...

Hey nigga ain't shit gonna ever change
Between you and your boo
Put a hold on me ever since I held you
What compelled you to be my nigga
Besides passion and love
You ran up on a real bitch with understanding and trust
Fuck the others, none of them compare to us
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga
When you stickin my stuff
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber
Took me shoppin all day and at night, you kept me cummin
Made dinner, collard greens, candied yams and steak
Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters
Hit you so you don't forget us
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby...
[Chorus: T-Boz & 
Da Brat
]
And all this love, is waiting for you
My baby... Sweet Darling...
And all this love is waiting for you
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around

Ran into your boy, had heard he'd spread the word
That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese
And pissing me the fuck off
The first thought of committing a felony never left
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation
If I'm incarcerated
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous
Who tell us the opposite of that
Forever you and Brat
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame...
[Chorus: T-Boz & 
Da Brat

And all this love, is waiting for you
My baby... Sweet Darling...
And all this love is waiting for you

And all this love is waiting for you
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around

Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Fuck me, Fuck me, Fuck me, Fuck me

Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your man
Bitch! I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
And I'd do it again

When I first saw your man we was really fine
And you was getting a little irritated that I was looking
Like you knew what was on my mind (fuck you)
You're not secure
It's written all over your face
You thought it wouldn't last (not tomorrow)
Top kitty in place
You see me as an obstacle
Staying away much as possible
It's mandatory that I command the attention of your man eye
Not to mention he can't help it because I'm fly
The plan is
I stroll by
Big bubble Chanel shades with diamond tips
Get up close and personal
Seduce with my lips
I ain't gotta say shit
He felling me and you all bent outta shape
Cuz I'm about to take who you with
Keep crunk
The run in my blood make a nigga jump jump
His body was banging
His teeth was pearly white
He had those strong keen features like Mario Van Peebles
His check bones was chiseled
His smile made me sizzle
His cologne had me sniffen' him from all the way home
I wanna smell this nigga and I this nigga to smell me


So the night went on
We keep it in each other sides
He kept coming around me just to see my behind
I was being so flirtatious with the body language
I was so anxious to make those arrangements
Tangle him up in the sheets
Transaction about to happen anytime that we meet
I put one foot in front of the other
Stopped to look in back of my nameplate in the mirror
Gotta make sure my lipstick is straight and not smeared
Its clear he wants me severely
So I slide over up to his ear and whispered it gently
Fuck Me! Fuck Me! Fuck Me!
You on the other hand nowhere to be found
Told you he was going to pee
But he came to find me
He felt you standing around
I'm a fuck him


You came to the bathroom
And guess what you saw
You saw my big brown titties popping outta my bra
With his mouth on my nipple like a suction cup
I was wrapped around him like an octopus
He was rubbing me down so I couldn't get up
I know you hate me now but I don't give a fuck
If he was yours like you said he was
His dick wouldn't have got so hard when I gave him is first hook
Ever since then he be loving on me diligently
Being all I need a nigga to be
He got me crawling the walls
I never been so quick to come up outta my drawers


You damn motherfucking right
I fucked that nigga
And I'm a fuck him again
Over and over again
Diligently bitch!
You know why I fucks with him and he fucks with me
Cuz I'm fly
Don't me mad that I caught you man's eye
It's the B to R-A-T once again from Chi
And it ain't no lie cuz I fucked him
I fucked your man

That's tight as a hot curl
Known to rock worlds
Once I'm spotted, you will probably drop your girl
My intimidation to niggas is challenging to 'em
He fiending to get in my Vicky's Secrets
And underneath my Girbauds and the boxer shorts
I rock Iceberg sports and Brat prints of all sorts
Interesting to you cause I got some dough

You'll never go broke

All my bitches
That live the hood life
Good life
My bitches
That don't need
A nigga for shit
Bitches
Niggas gotta holla at
Screamin
""where them dollars at""
I dedicates this one to you...

From the start I was in a hurry to crawl
And walk slap niggas before I could hardly talk
Now I got em on they knees screamin'
That's what the fuck I thought
No matter how I part the braids
Hear ya'll chatter when I rock it straight
I'mma bad bitch even when the style flipped
I get paid cause dough come fast in large amounts
Too much for one nigga to count
You must not know how a so so def ho bounce
To bust open another niggas accounts and be out
To the tellee or the atm in a 750 gray bm
Made a motherfucker pay for the rims
I fucked his friend but it's all good
He understood the way I live my life, my life
That I can't depend on nobody
For me to survive and stay high
Where all my bitches at? Girls
Make 'em love to hate us
And whether you classy to dick suckin'
Or a trashy bitch get your papers
I gotta eat throw these bows
Silently creep on these hoes
That's robbin' my flows you impostors to me
Prophets is all I see I ain't got time for beef
So I rhyme for cheese financially stable
Tryin' to make g's and I'm talkin' to

All my bitches
That live the hood life
Good life
My bitches
That don't need
A nigga for shit
Bitches wit a
Game plan
Rockin'
Name brand
I dedicates this one to you
I'm talkin' too...

That live the hood life
Good life
My bitches
That don't need
A nigga for shit
Bitches
Niggas gotta holla at
Screamin
""where them dollars at""
I dedicates this one to you...

And since I cover the mortgage
The car note, the porsche, and the condo
We still smokin'
Dollar signs are all I see excuse me
I got to cut the line leave you niggas behind
For the third time and shine on purpose
Blind'em every time I surface
If an aries hurt you you must deserve it
Every bit of a dime is worth it
Keep on swerving not perfect
But striving for that working with diamonds
And flirting with the finest cats
Desert the broke niggas that still live
With their momma's at
Provoke most to wanna wine a dine brat
Cause I'm dope from coast to coast
Guarantee to fall in love with me
After just one toast
Smoke weed that'll make you say
I ain't never getting' high again
Niggas always wanna see what I'm riding in
So I slide in the benz outfit match
From head to tims
Rims you ain't seen before fein for doe
Screamin' cream for mo and mo
Reap the benefits if it's free shit
I take gifts in all shapes and sizes
And diamonds is my favorite wish
Picture me rich a genius
When it comes to me collecting these chips
And this to...

All my bitches
That live the hood life
Good life
My bitches
That don't need
A nigga for shit
Bitches wit a
Game plan
Rockin'
Name brand
I dedicates this one to you
I'm talkin' too...

Runnin’ Outta Time,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Hmm, wonderin' where you been, baby, baby

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(I wanna know, I wanna know)
We've been runnin' out of time
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
(You've been runnin' around creepin' and pimpin' baby)
I've been sittin' home alone at night
I've been cryin' (oh)
We've been runnin' out of time
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey)
Tired of your lying

Uh, uh
Really though how much time you think I got?
The clock is ticking, it's ticking away
You're slippin' away fucking the honeys on the block stop
Cause if I gotta drop kick a ho, I'll kill her fa'sure
Let's stick around till the murderer curse
How you gonna creep with me and sleep with her?
At the moment of time
When I heard the news, my vision must have been blurred
Cause I ain't think you deserve to lose the nerve for fools
Shit people were saying was absurd to me
But I certainly never thought you would take it to the degree
Of hurtin' me, purposely
We were supposed to be husband and wife
So I dedicated myself to you
Why? So you could keep a chick on the side
Cause if I sneak a dick on the side you lookin' to die
And booking me a ticket to Chi cause you choose to lie
I need a nigga with an attitude, maturative mind
Give me gratitude when I'm giving him shine
No matter who the bastard was I was passed his love
But he never ran fast enough
I'm a master at the craft cause I roll with some master thugs
Laughin' as I pass you up
Should've told me that you wanted to get ass and fuck
I would've set it up so we all had some fun
You assist to get around
I'll be the aid and assist you to get out
Thank them hoes cause you're shit out of luck
And I don't regret what I spit out and bust
I'm sick and tired of you, us
I'm tired of sittin', cryin' and being alone
Nigga if you want to roam the streets then just let me be
There's a whole gang of niggas that wanna hit my sheets

I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(Come on baby yeah)
We've been runnin' out of time
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
(I've been yeah)
I've been sittin' home alone at night
I've been cryin'
(Not gonna cry no more, baby no)
We've been runnin' out of time
Tired of your lying
(Yeah you've been lying, lying baby)

Shit all I ever did was wait and look out the window
And smoke me some endo
It drove me to drinkin' and getting bent mo'
Gave myself 100% more time to think
Was love designed to stink?
Repeatedly you lied to me
Told you to confide in me
Ain't nothin' them other hoes could do
Cause I molded you
To fit properly was inside of me
When you're strokin' them
You're thinkin' of riding me
And most of them hopin' to slide with me
Cause I'm a ferocious hoe
When it comes to freaky shit the dopest
You had to blow this
It's all out of proportion and lost your focus
Wasting my time cause I'm just getting older
You're the reason I keep a chip on my shoulder
44 in the holster bulletproof vest under my clothes
I'm supposed to trust you
Every time I leave town I bust you, fuck you
The moaning and groaning
Led me to the pillow where you laid you head
Felt like I'd rather be dead instead
Went ahead followed the sound through the hallway
You said you'd always be true
But the neighbors say the bitch was there all day with you
That's why you ain't answered when I was paging you
I hit the door, you duck and dove
She tried to find her clothes
Y'all was dodging bullets holes together
You gonna stay with that broke hefer
You know who the So So Defest is
I ain't gotta show a motherfucker breastesses
To keep 'em interested in
You better recognize the good investment
From the West Side of Chi nigga

(I've been)
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(Said I've been wonderin' where you've been)
(Wonderin' where you've been)
We've been runnin' out of time
(We've been runnin', runnin' out of time)
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
(Cause I'm tired of lies baby)
I've been sittin' home alone at night
(Don't wanna be alone)
I've been cryin'
(Don't wanna be alone, no, no)
We've been runnin' out of time
Tired of your lying (yeah)

(2000)
I've been wonderin' where you've been sleepin'
(AP hit me on the trizzack, deuce, deuce ya know?)
We've been runnin' out of time
Cause you wanna be creepin', pimpin'
I've been sittin' home alone at night
I've been cryin'
We've been runnin' out of time
Tired of your lying

Chi Town,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Uh, any chance I get I'm on a plane
I book advance tickets and pay the fees with no complaints
In the summer its off the hook no time to waste
Just lie at the lake and I'm shoulder dry to the taste
Even though some niggas I grew up with hate
I keep a few good homies that try to stay outta jail
Tonio tell me what the bail is it'll be there
And when you get out my coke tail here
The crack head deals in my daddy
And all he seem to dream about is bad ass habits
The gun shots scream loud
So I soak the radio from upstairs to outside the house
With the extended cord no night is boring
On the front porch even if its pouring
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

The liquor store on every corner packed
The bus run twenty-fo and my stop Jackson
Fire hydrant busted time for action
Niggas come out like its the beach in Miami
The cops chase thiefs all through the alley and don't stop
These niggas kill for rocks
If you can't stand up for your spot don't squat
Shop for a vacant lot or get shot
Cuz Chicago niggas don't play them games
When it comes to slanging them thangs for the money mane
Fuck around and get short for the playas ball
And call don Juan to flash green on yall
The pimps got the hoes pinned up on the wall
Just pass me the blunt and I puff it all
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through
Chi town the city with the best skyline
Born there that's home there in my lifetime

Don't worry about what I do for my city
Some of yall run your mouth too much and what a pity
If you outside looking in, shit seem pretty
But its a lot of shit to do with bitch...I did it
I'm cold in the winter my mink track the flow
With the hat to match cadillacs in the snow
If its a block party the whole hood know
Niggas from 3 and 1st streets overcome the smoke
Its K Town times 22 next shine
Who label he on mine Westside nigga right
To my Southside niggas and my Eastside niggas
And my Northside niggas get high
We really don't give a fuck what side you from
Just keep on hollering out Chi!!!
In the summer, winter, fall, or spring
I love it when my bitches and my ballers sing

Chi town, Chi town, the city where I'm from
As a kid to who I become live to get what I want
Chi town the city with the best skylines
Born there that's home there in my lifetime
Chicago show'em how we do
The best place some hate but they still come through

Hands in the Air,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Niggas always watchin me (funky!)
But I want em to keep on watchin me
I'ma keep give em sumthin to see (smokin!)

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin me, watchin me
Could it be the way I'm still tight?
Niggas that didn't use to feel me jockin me, jockin me
The, whole world got too much money for me
To not get no dough, dough, can't no hoe
Rock harder than the one from So-So
I never go broke broke
I keep comin with the vocals that make most know
Why the fuck I boast, boast and brag
Why should I look sad that I got some loot now?
In fact, I knew how
Watch when I back the Coupe out
Can niggas just troop out
The same way they do when I show you Brat
With a little bit of boobs out
And her big ass protrude out
Get the news out
Some of you bitches lose out
When the sexiness ooze out
Like orgasms, I'm the best at this
Throwin tantrums when I move into makin shit
If you thinkin of becomin one of my favorites
You gotta pay a bitch
Cause I be stayin rich
I ain't quittin, quittin
Way before ""Funkdafied"" I was spittin, spittin

Throw yo hands in the air like you dont care
This fo niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on em, get cash on em
And make em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever im high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired
To get that paper, baby

If y'all wanna see me, see me
Im give y'all somethin to look look at
Make a nigga neck turn turn for Brat
Burn burn these hoes cuz I'm back and my pants still sag
It's automatic, they wanna jump on my wagon, wagon
I ain't lackin lackin on shit
Open ya eyes when my body when I try on clothes that fit fit
I'm articulate and particulate on who I let hit hit
And get up in the middle of the center of my tootsie roll
Roll me something to smoke smoke and burn slow slow
Don't keep it a secret, tell all ya folks
See you when I shine, I glow, glow
From the C-H-I-C-A-GO, 6-0-6-4-4
And I trust no, nigga that make a mistake for me
Guns ready to blaze and to leave with you
Some of the ones run
I can't control my trigger finger when it pump pump
Stay out the way when I come come
It's guaranteed to bump bump the trunk, uh
And put a hump in ya back
If niggas is askin who's thumpin, it's Brat Brat

Throw yo hands in the air like you dont care
This fo niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on em, get cash on em
And make em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever im high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired
To get that paper, baby

I keep my bad braids back when puttin the dick on the track
You can turn it down playa, we don't listen to that
The bass dont thump, we spit on crap
That beat ain't tight nigga, that shit ain't fat
Everytime that shit come out, I toss it back and I slap
I be breakin ya back to the rhythm of rap
(?)Test it loud for the low frequency, where it's at?(?)
Niggas say, ""I love that fuckin shit ya did wit Da Brat!""
Actin bad with the pad, with the pen, with the paper
Still smoke a nigga under the table
Put the lines in the words and the hooks and the phrases
Instead of puttin out sumthin thats blazin
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya foot out ya mouth
And ya head out ya ass
And keep ya nose out my buisness
And I mean it, goddammit, cuz I'm fiddinta get MAD!
I put em in the trash bag
Twist tie, put em out Monday and Wednesday
I kick em in they raggely ass
Take money from em and you know I better get some
I know it ain't fair
But I smoke with alligators and I wrestle with bears
Throw ya hands in the air
As high as you can, and leave them bitches there!

Throw yo hands in the air like you dont care
This fo niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on em, get cash on em
And make em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side

Come and Get Some,Funkdafied,1994.0,"Get down... ain't no room to mess around
When Da Brat-tat-tat-tat's all up in your town
I'm in the front with a blunt never playing the back
It's that new nigga on the block and I don't slack
Ta- dow now (I know you love how I put it down)
Now (I know you love how my shit sounds)
So close your eyes as I mesmerize your mind
1 time 2 times 3 times I'm
Not that bitch to be fucked with or seen
Cause puttin it down ain't no thing bitch you know the routine
Either recite what I write or hold that ass
Cause ain't no seeing this G be hitting your ass with a blast
Now (There I go there I go there I go)
(With my funkdafied funkdafied westside flow)
If you ain't down you best to get down quick
Cause ain't another bitch (like) this bitch (right) shit

When your in the mood to flow let me know
Cause to me it ain't no thing I'm always ready to go
Now I know that you know that I know you gets none
But if you want some come and get some

To be or not to be fucked with is Da Brat with some gangsta shit
I'm cappin any nigga that step or disrespecting my click
It be the crooked letta O double that once more
Def and I have yet to speak on this bad ass ho
How many bitches do you that kick shit like this bitch
No nothers so others witness the rack-ed wicked
As I bust shit niggas can't fuck with
This bad mamma jamma lick shots like twin Glocks and plus it's
On, till I let them fools disperse
Ghetto bust proper first verse after verse
It gets worse as I puff on the chronic smoke
Me and my pad locc up I smoke up and niggas get broke
Off, tossed like a cloth
I gives a fuck about what niggas say how they walk how they talk
Cause to meet 'em y'all needs to quit
Cause in '94  I be the wrong bitch to fuck with

When your in the mood to flow let me know
Cause to me it ain't no thing I'm always ready to go
Now I know that you know that I know you gets none
But if you want some come and get some

Now as the sound breaks down let me slide up in
The M-A-C's who I be Kris Kross is who I represent
For so very long
But this time I'm with Da Brat and once again it's on
With the K to the K (by the way) dum di di dum
Mr. Mac pack now can I drop the bomb
Saggin all dressed in black
I'm the nigga with them braids shades khakis and pimp packs
Leanin to the side peepin out the scene
Niggas on my dick cause I got green and I'm a fiend
To the microphone which I'm known to rock
Bangin till the boogie end boogie time I'm hip hop
I know you still feel
The devastation of my lyrics so please kneel
To the king that I may very be
The macadocious A-town player the M-A-C

When your in the mood to flow let me know
Cause to me it ain't no thing I'm always ready to go
Now I know that you know that I know you gets none
But if you want some come and get some",https://genius.com/Da-brat-come-and-get-some-lyrics

I'm in love like Maxwell
You see me cryin' but I just can't help it
My self esteem is even higher when I'm walking with you
You give me fire and desire like Tina Marie and Rick James do

When I seduce em' they just wanna hold me

Fine as Roy Jones makin' a move in my bones
You presents makes everything else irrelevant when we close
Turn off the 2 way, you lay your head on my pillow
And do me baby, the rhythm gonna get chu groovin' baby
And we can rock until broad day light
Body's knockin' the boots, destroying property, poppin' me up
To get through, it ain't right, how you feeling on my booty
It's just you and me unexplanatory
The way you adore me
Lord have mercy somebody gonna have to pray for me
Your worthy, my service is superb

Gotta Thing for You,"Limelite, Luv, & Niteclubs",UnKnown,"My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
So let me tell about Da Brat-ta-ta-ta-ta
I'm light skin, redbone, peanut butter complxion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5"", my astrology sign is Aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with these lucious suckable lips
Making you wanna reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin' out of my jeans?
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin, blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming
All the people, they fallin' like Alicia
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This you ain't used to seeing
So please, believe it, you needin the B to the R muthafucking AT

I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go

I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh
I'd be sitting in my car waiting on you to drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like Roger and Jessica Rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten, I'm rocking pink silk panties at the moment
But I'm sport cotton but jeanie's dreamin' of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these days niggas is crazy
You can't pay me to roll without my AK

I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
(Check it out)

I can't let go of this game
I can't let go of this fame
But for sure, before I go
You niggas gonna know my name
'Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie that rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly scheduled program
I throw down and bust it
There ain't no hoe around touching me
I'm sharper than cutlerly
I slice niggas to itty bitty pieces
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh

I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
And I can't let go, I smoke
So, so def

High Come Down,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Yeah, yeah come on
(Baby, you make my)
Yeah, yeah come on
Yeah, yeah come on
(Baby, you make my)
Yeah, yeah come on

Each day I come in it's always somethin'
Don't stress me I'm paid like Phil Drummin
I pop like ten Cristies a day
In the spot like I'm way past risque
B R A T hard and sexy
And you can't get next to me, baby
With a blunt in my hand shit is obsolete
I don't wanna be fucked with when I cheat
It's my smoking lye, how it's supposed to be
You bitches could never get close to me
Hopefully you know not to blow my high
Impose in my zone extinguish my fire
It's my desire to blaze it up
Mad 'cause I puff I don't give a fuck
Don't come around me with no negative shit
Step up, step up and I'ma bust your lip

'Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high
(To the sky)
First thing you can do is make my high come down
(Down, down)
Ooh, when you make my high come down
I don't wanna be around you no more

Let's space it out, my faith is out
When I get frustrated I take it out
On the optimo so break it out
Gun me vicariously till I choke me
Make no mistake about Miss Harris stakin' out
Good cabbage lay it out
Gray for glycoma, rotten to Daytona
How to survive?
Get high all by your lonesome unless you want some company
I might pass the blunt but this bud's for me
My concentration and know nothing else
I take my problems lay 'em on the shelf
Block all the calls then shut off the cell
It's not absurd niggas get on my nerves with
Bullshit too much for this bitch
Me and my spliff don't wanna be fucked with

'Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high
(To the sky)
First thing you can do is make my high come down
(Down, down)
Ooh, when you make my high come down
I don't wanna be around you no more

Usually, when I split my gun down the middle
Got good weed, so strong it takes just a minute
For me to get to that place we love to go
I made this shit so you would know
When the ashes burn off
I get flashes on how you were turned off
And a big distraction, don't nobody wanna be agitated
Upset or annoyed and aggravated
Masturbation ain't stimulating as this
When it's twist, put it up to my lips and hit
Don't forget to puff, puff and pass
My blunt is stuffed up with chunks of hash

'Cause I don't like to be fucked with when I'm high
(To the sky)
First thing you can do is make my high come down
(Down, down)
Ooh, when you make my high come down
I don't wanna be around you no more, no more",https://genius.com/Da-brat-high-come-down-lyrics
Breeve on Em,Unrestricted,2000.0,"I Don't stop, I stay hot, y'all stay shocked, we keep it locked
Just throw yo hands in the air motherfuckas
I came to make y'all freak one another
I, I keep bangin', I keep slangin'
We keep watching niggas die for simple things
So I keep swingin', fuckin' a nigga head up
Dead up, I'm fed up feel my lead bust

Now I don't stop, but I smoke weed
I ain't gotta pop rocks no more I got G's
Just wave you hands from side to side
Cause we gone show keep it live
We got greed in our eyes, I keep spittin', I keep rippin'
I keep women, I creep and keep hittin'
They impressed with my shoe size, deuce I'm with you tonight
Girl if you do it right, me and you can do it twice
When I'm called on to bust, wanna get yo brawl on with us
Can't ball with us, too hard to touch
22 fuckin' up they callin' us
Im the first one off the bus, got nuts to lust
They keep rushin' for status, some more than you got it
All for cabbage as far as we got it
So don't push me, I'm too close to the edge
Bout to go loco on these niggas, leave'em for dead, and
When it's time for us, bitch we diamond cut
I'm 22, We West-Chi
And I'm da motherfuckin' Brat right

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours
If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

When I hit the door, nigga best move, guess who
We ain't got no dress shoes, just a couple scarves and a vest too
Test who why you trippin' we came to party
Run game and probably leave the party with somebody
Gotta be hard, women they love to touch it
And when I fuck 'em they hypnotized
Sprung cause I hit it right, tongue tied sometimes
Like Zinfandel wine, got they mind blown
In my zone, I'm a grown man, gone I ain't tryin' to keep her
She got nice features, but so do Mesha, Imma keep creepin'
Keep getting deeper they playa hate me all of a sudden
A new kid bussin', you hear it hush and she
Scared to cut___fuckin' too many hoes, me I got
Twenty hoes, I'ma hoe, be a hoe, spend the dough, see a show
Let it be known playa west to east
Cause I'm the dog that fell in love with the Georgia Peach

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours
If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

I heard you wanna hit this twat, nigga I thought not
Fell up in the party with a phat knot, Glock cocked
Got too much of my own shit to stop
And look for niggas, when I make any dick rock
Shook them niggas, took all they cheese, still they say
They body's callin' for me, wanna go half on a seed and shit
Fuck that, I got half on the weed and shit and I'm Brat
One of a kind of my breed and shit and you can find me
On the West Side of Chi with my thieving click, believe a bitch
Cause ain't no nigga hated on the pussy yet
Squeeze the dick, got grip, they can't forget
Ain't a hoe tight like me, flow tight like me
Quote, write and recite, fuck all night like me
They say is she is or is she ain't a dyke
You curious cause you wanna fuck me tonight

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough

In the corner passing blunts, sippin' Yack (Baby)
And if you must play the game
Then gamble the stake's raised
Take baby to Vegas I need the paper
My flesh burnin'
Niggas got me under surveillance their necks turnin'
I'm an international playa, close observation
The best policy is to stay in y'all faces
The bad seed, I get niggas like I breath it's easy
Been through niggas lyin' and cheatin' with bitches that's sleazy
None of it's worth repeatin'
If you flash money, spend that money or you can beat it
I'mma star now, so it wasn't really shit for me to get shot down
Spit illicit, unrestricted game, I'm independent
Open the door to the bank but g's spent this

If you out here doing things
You're a honey getting money
Playin' all of these fellas like dummies
Make all the right moves when it comes to the game

For the first time I can see my lifeline
And you're ahead of me
Thank God hard to imagine me
But Lord why me?
I'm the bad spirit that tortures the souls of the nearest
Untouched pussy, what'chu want with me?
Been through lesbianage, menage et tois
Been even synonymous to hoes that floss and trick their dough
If you livin' it, my life
You live it as limited
Cause too many worlds collide the killer degenerate
I'll die in it
As long as I keep my guns burn
And Brat pushin' the Verge
And the crack isn't German
Listen Ja bring the heat catching niggas on their third wind
We supply the pressure (Baby!)
Shit it'll never end try to get out
But baby you're locked in
My world sip Hen and suffer from sin
I'm sickening like Heroin
Ja Rule the veteran, true with you
But baby girl if you

And continue to add pieces to the rock collection that I got
Shine on y'all light up the whole block

Shit on a nigga like me you need a lot
Coming with game, what'chu got
It's murda, if you don't get shot
I clicky-clack on those pot post up on niggas
Fuck y'all bitches
Shit fuck y'all niggas, you can't live without pussy
Be disrespectful and get no more nookie
Most of these hoes check y'all cause niggas ain't shit
Y'all dismissed and y'all know
Bitches ain't shit
But live with it if the dick don't fit
Get it or quit it
And acquaint Shaunte with your money

Pop a nigga like a pimple keep it simple enough

Ignite it up try to bite my style too tought
Its too much , too lil, too late for you to come up
Be decieved of ya wanna be foolish this bad mannered bitch is
True to the shit, envoke the spirits like the craft's
Serve the niggas half the stash in case the cash get low
The bastard know
Fuck over the dough and die
Pick yo casket if you feel that you gone try some shit
No nigga ever lasted past the first attempt
I leave em baffled and gaffle em for all of they keys
Then dispence to my niggas like Sony distributing LP'S

As the clock keep ticking tick, tick gotta keep my vision bleary
I'm in a hurry to get this paper don't worry I'm a dough chaser I'm
Still living my dreams wheather its hustling, shaking
And shuffling niggas around I'm getting more greater
And its the gang shit that I ain't seen yet
And its the gang niggas I ain't meet yet
Even though I been to Paris and London and rome
Japan, Africa, Baghdad Amsterdam brought back a phat sack
And I'm rolling dem joints chrome flashing sparkling like gucci colins
When I throw on that boostey
You niggas can't stop slobbing
I'm a pretty young thug and its hotter than ever
Fucking it up so I get paid to do stuff never
When this cheddar at stake
I'm a chain billionaire blow a couple of millon
Some cars so my family and homies can ride like stars

I'm all about the money I don't know about you
I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do
Gotta whole lotta living to do be4 I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Honey yeah yeah
Now understand me cause its not complex
I'm young and restless with one life to
Live so I cash checks
I'm individually wrapped liked a fresh twinkie
So if I cream in the middle
Nigga licky, licky, licky, licky
Become sponge bob absorb me up
Can't just polish this I demolish the flow
Niggas astonished when I spit
When I'm pissed I let it flow
I can afford me a Bentley
Without having to forge a signature
Or getting a nigga to co sign with me
I get bored quickly so I
Sour on the g4 to Cali for more sticky gravy life
Come hop on this tour with me lets get faded for life
I used to save up cookies they are brown even
But I got rid of the whole box
And I didn't even turn the loot in'
I'm shootin' its all cause of you lame ass butlers
When I smirk if devils could talk mine would say fuck ya!

Its so so def
How could the cans get dropped
From the mansion to the high rise to the block we hot
I rock the white people the Latinos and foreigners
Niggas can't see me when they cry I scratch out there corniers
I'm warning ya I was born a winner
I scare crowed off like that Anna Lotono
Did right after she sang 'home in the weares
After the blizzard that's
When I came through with them frosted pieces was dripping like icicles
Keep a few of dem precious V-V-S's next to my skin
So with the best investment jems ain't no second guessing its here
Ain't not question who the best is
Take a lesson from a bitch who is the goodie in years
Never skooted in here got dem all in here
Cause dirty money spin like clean money from da A-T-M dummy
So when you done bumping your gums there's a lot of dough to be made
You should get you sum before its too late
And you left wiv none
Now its all bout the cash where ever it come from

A classic story be told
Carmen a hip hopera watch the drama unfold
The tragic tale of a girl
Tryin' to capture the gold
With a free spirit, brothers strady tryin' to hold
What would you do for love? (uh huh)
Is the cost too much?

My Beliefs,Anuthatantrum,1996.0,"That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

I gets embedded in your cerebellum, deeper than the ocean
Focusin' on fuckin' a nigga up, who got jokes?
Provoke me, my vision of lust is money, trust is funny
Too many sheisty motherfuckers comin' for me
One in the chamber, ready for repetition if possible
Hate to mention this, poppin' that nigga, bitch
It be the intellectual, get sexual in a second heffer
You could never be no competition to me
You bit the poison apple, tryin' adapt to this shit
Show you how it happened
While we laughin', diggin' your ditch
And you can get your boys
I got Disciples and ViceLords
Planted through every city ready, declare war
If you feel I stepped on your toes
It was intentionally
Cause it was meant to be the shit since I found JD
My lyrical thesis broke in pieces
For you pussies who can't feed off it
Everything'll be fine, just hit the weed often

That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

I believe good things come to those that grind
Never take a step back, leave the past behind
Keep your mind on some money and don't ever stop tryin'
And everything'll be fine, everything'll be fine
It's time to let your lighter spark
Crank up the weed session
With one of the best in the Midwestern section
Flexin' with no shame
Cause a mi solo female MC's be back in the game
Sun up to sun down I puff leaves
Filled with imported trees from the West Indies
Chi-town's finest in more ways than one
Me follow in the path of another, days is done
See I got mic checkin' down to a science
Meanin' I perfected the ways
To shit on you and your alliance
I write the type of shit that'll hypnotize ya
Fuck around and kill your whole click like Kaiser
In the streets of Prazza, the Westside of niggas
Ain't expects, smellin' like cannibus
Can't nothin' handle this
They wanna dismantle this but it will never go down
Shit, cause my beliefs is I'm the baddest around, bitch

That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't give a fuck about what these niggas think
That's they beliefs, here go mine

Now it's the shit, you wanna contest me
Never will you be the opponent left
Leave'em swept off they feet
So So Def got that chief shit, keep it brief
Under the covers ain't another bitch bad as me
So I must keep comin'
Keep on runnin' but you can't escape me
I'm in your brain
Remember the bitch you love to hate
She on the paper chase
In any case, but not any rate
Keep the currency's increase, shit ain't cheap
And my belief is to get the money, nigga
So what's the beef to this?
Enough cheese for Brat, never endin' G's
Hundred thousand dollar bills by the stack
The weak supportin' my habits
Enough karats for the whole salad
Smokin' cabbage every five minutes
Beginnin' my days rollin' swishes
I never listen to penny pinchin'
Pussy eatin' punks advice
To catch'em slippin' is my theory
Be weary what I bust, make niggas weak
And pack a bleeder, top notch in my speeches

That I shouldn't smoke weed and shit, huh
That I should cuss and shit, huh
That I shouldn't do the shit I wanna do
You know what I'm sayin'?

I got hairs on my funk and I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm hooked on phonics packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious with malice and mayhem straight out of a p-funk dictionary
Give me the mic and watch me slay them
Those lame illiterate poetic systems
Pisses me off
Should be missing me with that shit
Putting that petty poetry package pathetically in front of me
I suppress; I arrest the best of MCs regularly

In the beginning I was doubted
Slid in and rerouted
This shit to places y'all bitches weren't even thinking bout hittin'
Heads splittin', shittin' hard on niggas
With a name like Brat exotic cars and large bank figures
A high rank nigga
Top spot taker
Maker of some hot shit loose
Makin' it hard for all yall bitches to move around like moose
Bruise whateva touch come through in a clutch
Bitch beat me never heard of such
Niggas say I'm just too much
Consistent dollar clocker
Sipping lemonade and vodka
Private shopper live and die hip hopper
With the platinum touch
That's what the fuck up
And I ain't tryna lack and slack shit
I'm tryna pack and stack shit
To continue to make phat shit

And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust
And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust

I'm livin' in high times with a lifeline when the sun don't shine often
Taught that the bare necessity was to never let no nigga see me soften
Coughin' up phlegm in the morning from choking on dank daily
Beware my attitude shady pay me and serenade this lady
Reached impossible limits no gimmick lyrics
Livin' trife and lavish Ms. Harris with 25 karats
To cherish the iced out ouster perpetual roll
The swish and burn it slow cats me know
Never fishin' for roaches or smokin' the hocus pocus
Once I was the brokest bitch now afford the dopest shit
The poker Chips get placed on the misses with twisted
Shoe here
Chi town's windy city creeper weed keeper
Redrumming niggas like the shining when the molestation begins

And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust
And niggas know..
The lyrical molestin is takin place
And when Da Brat is in your area your shit ain't safe
To live my whole life lavish I lust plus crushin'
Competitions a must everytime I bust

If you consider yourself to be a competitor
The object of the game is to bury ya
Get the cheddar the mo' the merrier 3-1-2 the area
Prepare for my brigade to stay paid and obligated
To knock off niggas in ways you only saw take place in animation
Your expiration date is past due
We conjured up this shit to last you till infinity
Finna be multimillion in a minute
Only solo ho to do more than your average bitch
Making niggas sick and having fits watchin me push the Benz six
Admit it I'm da type to get addicted to like China
Watch you fucking wit pure dough
Tonight's da night we all get high
Niggas know Brat take without askin
Leaving everlasting gashes on you bastards
Lyrical assassin and niggas know

Therefore this rap rendition introdition of competition
Made some motherfucker before the first admission
Gets to a center mountain I sip the spout
Rhyming ad infinitum
I pee in the fountain then I claw
Clutching the cliff cuz I've got to get higher
Into the mantic with the mad messiah
GC's going crazy hacking the channel through all the slack rappers
I pack I pack a bag I travel
To the peninsula with the posse I peep over the edge
Drop a rock over your head as you leaving up the ledge to lead on
Leaving you mangled, tangled in your mic chord
Your momma would've been better in battle
Your boasting is bogus; silly posing
Putting your petty poetry package pathetically in front of me
I suppress; I arrest the best of MCs regularly",https://genius.com/Da-brat-lyrical-molestation-lyrics
Intro,Unrestricted,2000.0,"BuckWIIIILD outrageous do what you feel like doin'
Tell a motherfucker no when you don't feel like screwin
I did it, you do it, break the ties that bound
Keep a motherfucker off you, keep your feet on the ground
HEYYY! FUCK YOU if you can't go for that
And a double fuck you from Da Brat-a-tat-tat
Let it all hang loose, never feelin' afflicted!
Go for what you want and it's called ""Unrestricted""

May the Lord be my witness
From the ""Funk"" to the ""Tantrum"" now ""Unrestricted""
The 
K-Town
 bitch too wicked
Chi-villain, they be killin' every mark in the district
Can y'all skill match it?
Right off Kilpatrick from the six-oh-six-fo'-fo'
Got hit 'cause ya clip so slow
Motherfuckers can't do shit with ""So So""
Shine like a twenty inch Mo-Mo
For the Navi' on top of them dubs
Hit me in the mug, and deliver the bud
Now you talkin' 'bout my gul
Terror for the millenium, straight fuckin' up anyone (anyone, shit)
Steady bust like a semi gun
Murderin' over any drum, comin' out from the dark
Here to let you know here she come

Can't nobody do what I done
Niggas and bitches think they run
Finna throw another one of my ""Tantrums"" redrum
And the six-oh-six-fo'-fo' is where I'm from
Callin' on my nigga Twista to set this shit off
Two of the best motherfuckers on the Westside
If I need to relieve stress I get high
This the introduction, unrestricted is how I bust in
Like a blow to the dome and a severe concussion, shock a ho
And niggas that talk about me, all they want
'Cause I'm a bad bitch
And I'mma continue to be that 'til I'm gone

Shit, babygirl you ain't even gotta hurt 'em like that
Commit a murder like that
Let off like an asskick and serve a hype track
Hit the world like volcanos
Earthquakes, bombs, thunder and lightnin'
No wonder it's frightening
Hoes might as well not come out of hiding
'Cause you really be about to crush 'em
Dustin' em off like Hoffman and hush 'em
Feel the repercussions of a girl
From a place where they're gangsterin' and hustlin'
Ballin' and bustin' is all I know
Dodge low from my Chi flow
We smokin' on fye bo
And work thirty calibers off like Tae-Bo
In the middle of the function flossin'
With a grip no script but ""Legit Ballin'""
Better go on with the shit talkin'
I create corpses for caskets and coffins
Niggas don't want Twista to spit, I kick that Mobtastic shit
Introduction for a raw and sometimes psychotic bitch

Oh I'm the befo', but Da Brat is the after
We pimpslap lame bitches just for the laughter
All or nothin, never a fraction
Yeah, you got it.. motherfuckin Millie Jackson
You BITCHES!

What’s on Ya Mind?,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Ay homie

I make ya horny huh (giggle) shit
You act like you want some nigga.....do you?

Di di di da di di di da di day
I'm on the dance floor and you up on it in every way
Day to day you think of me
Can't wait to get to the club to see my face just to smoke and drink with me
The DJ keep spinnin' the hot records
Make the whole table go crazy the first second
Third I'm ready and able to hit the middle
Under that disco ball so I could shake a little
This shit for yall who dance with me
Touchin' my ass and titties so frantically
Don't get carried away with it
I'll let you have a little fun if you play with it
Insatiably, when I cum I do it patiently
Cuz if it ain't all night its a waste to me
You been chasing me for the longest time
Like Billy Joel so please tell me what's on ya mind..nigga

Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind

I put my hands on the back of your fade
And we danced till the crack of dawn came
To the sun raise up its on
Still got stamina to take you home
Brat the damager managed to handle any position handed to her
You wanna fuck with the funk bandit
Leave it alone when the sweat trinkle down my cleavage you can't stand it
And you ain't even believing you dancing with Brat
And making eye contact
Homie put your hands on my waist and occassionally
Run your fingers through my fresh ass braids and say to me
That you feel horny cuz I wanna know
If you want some of this I wish you tell me so
Cuz if I let you touch me I must want you to go
Home with me be alond with me to get some mo'
Cuz we smoke we drink we bump and grind
And even though I'm tipsy I wanna know what's on ya mind

Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind
Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just wanna know what's going through ya mind mind mind

Brat now let me rock it from a niggas perspective
No chick can neglect this
Just listen when I stress this
The bitch was breathless
Big lips so thick make me wanna drop draws
Star had me rock hard shaking like a pornstar
Uh huh wassup shorty
Won't you be my sweet lover friend what homie
Thug love homie Brat put you up on pink lemonade
That's why I don't attract rats with my serinades
Stack off plubicades
Lack when it comes to brains
More than 2 women I'mma stack'em then play the game
Rack'em they love my name 22
Cuz they figure amongst themselves can I really enject 2
With my nine inch source see me climb in the nookie screaming
Everything is mine while I'm grinding the pussy
Can you picture that what's on ya mind baby push me
I don't mind raiding the jar just to get a cookie, uh

Homie, you act like you want some
Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh

We Ready,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Come on then, shit
(So give it to 'em, whoa!)
Lay your head back (Whoa!)
Lay it on me (Whoa! Whoa!)
And for the money (Yeah whoa!)
You can lay that shit on me too (Whoa!)
But for now let's talk about riding
Yeah I'm saying it's like this
(Brat where are you at?)

You know its So So Def
Cause I'm the B to the R-A
T the most eligible bitch today
And these niggas wanna ride with a dime like me
They say they like the way the system pound in my jeep
I got two twelve's that bump from wall to wall
So loud that he headlights blink on and off
I laugh when people watch I don't stop I shine
It's attractive to motherfuckers that love to grind
I sparkle from the rims to the chain to the watch
To the rings to the ears to the wrists to the Glocks
To the parts in the braids
Shorties that stop to watch throw on the shades
Cause Da Brat got gleam for days
Sunroof open let the sun shine in
Baking the fuck out of me and all my friends
In the backseat, stay in the front
Ain't no room in the trunk
Just a devastating woofer that bump
You know!

So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves
And anybody that wants some
Nigga we ready for you (We ready!)

Uh I keep the windows down
So when I hit the stoplight
All the niggas standing around spot what they like
They shoot me the 'Come Here' finger
But the music's so loud I just smile
And act like I don't see 'em
I've done had one or too many shots of Tequila
But when it's set to crunk I need my liquor
Loud and rowdy naturally
Pull up to my truck and smile
But you ain't proud of me
I left you in the rearview with a look of disgust
And a mad mug cause your windows almost bust
I can't fathom the thought of my seats not rumbling
And people catching whiplash when I past in front of 'em
I'm flashy and I don't care if you know
From the C to the H-I-C-A-G-O
I'm fresh to death no matter how I'm dressed
It's even hard for the cops to put me under arrest
Irresistibly huggable and lovable when
I gotta wiggle myself out of the trouble I get in
I'm Da Brat officer he turned and laughed
And said stop disturbing and got an autograph

So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves
And anybody that wants some
Nigga we ready for you (We ready!)

Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Lots of niggas hear the sound now they flagging me down
Get attention when I drive by cause I'm so fly
Shorty the pimp represent the West Side of Chi
Know the haters watching
I love making 'em sick
I tear the roof off this mother like Parliament
People ride with me just to feel the bass in their chest
And be reminded of how it sounds So So Def

See what we do other niggas can't
That's why for ten long years
I've been making 'em dance
You know?
Me and Da Brat it's family boy
Ya know?
We ain't never gon' break down
For y'all hatin' ass niggas
We gon keep on and keep on
Ya heard? (We ready!)

So So Def is the place and we
Ain't never gon stop
With Da B-R-A-T
We gon keep this bitch on lock
We the best at what we do
Getting paper making all the moves

Pink Lemonade,Unrestricted,2000.0,"Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade

If ya thirstay I could possibly slide down your throat
If you work may let's say we skip the foreplay
Picture me kicking in the doorway to set off the storay
NegligГ©e hot tip of the knockers stay brick like rocks
Figure if you drop ice here I don't stop
Cuz its twice as nice when its frosted up
Sweetness like this could never cost enough
With a so so twist try this stuff
Mouth watering love succulent to all taste buds
Must of been us you was dreaming of the crush
I breeve on 'em and make 'em feel the lust
Then jiggle the lemons a little so they feen to touch
Cream to us say nuh thing to us scared
Premium pink stuff and swing with us sweetened it up
To it make you wanna say ooh its cool

Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade

I'm weighed in at one tree five a big gulp size
Seven eleven can't satisfy your appetite all night
JD and I planned it to be dickable so its alright
You can come and escapade in my escalade
Lay me flat on my back and slurp away
I get action in a Bentley with no brains
Just pure satisfaction cracking with no cain
I came for the thrill of it I ain't looking for real love
Just the feel of it
After just one taste you still bugging
Da black cat make you wanna handle business
Until the pleasure principle kick it it
If you hit this I'll make you tell your wife and your mistress
To leave town cuz they been evicted
Hit up a record store pick up Brat and get addicted

Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade
Cool, refreshing cool, (ooh ooh)
It taste best with you
Add that sugar baby in my pink lemonade

A thirst quenching mouth watering concoction
Your only option drink to ya pink why stop it
One think its refreshing isn't it the best when you sipping it
Heaven sake honey buns built for dipping in
Money come quicker than a two minute brother
That concentrate on stiffin' when he love it
Stick when too dry so keep sturring
It still be the sweet even if it turn syrup
Hurry up and get a cup full cop fills and get' cha cap peeled back
Rash a little rat first smash went classic
Even with my homies hlep on the west you wack
Sincerely Brat where my girls at
We stick together in the rain
Batches of pink lemonade bringing da pain
Any day and every minute make you wanna get up in it
Cuz its just that cool

Ball Game,Hardball (Music From The Motion Picture),UnKnown,"Shut cho' ass up girl, ha ha
Ya know, I bought me some diamonds
Show em' what cha' bought me
Ya know, I'll show myself off, ya dig ha ha ha
They hate me, ya know they gon' hate me, ha ha oh Lord

Take me out to the ballgame
Spend no small change
Now show me off to the people in the crowd man
I like big thangs

This chick here gets thicker each year
And I have no fear, what I spit in yo ear
Mommie dearest keepin' it clean and clear
My home base, stick it to ya face and to ya rear
We veer to the left, why
Cause that's how So So Def ride
We run the streets from A-T-L to Chi
We leaves no traces, we just glide
Lay back and switch side to side
We choke on hay all day in the middle of the barn
It seems you want me to be the lady under ya arm
Well I'll consider it, maybe
Show me ya tongue baby
And i'm sure that I could make it all gravy
All bases gotta be loaded
So I can slide on in, in a Bentley, Benz, or my Rover
Take me out and be my Casanova
Like Levert, and I might convert just to hold ya


Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks
I don't care if I never get back
I'ma root, root, root for my home team
Cause we always win and it's a shame
That it's one, two, three strikes for you
At the old ballgame
Come on, bet against So So Def, forget it
Your chances of winning
Is lookin' itty bitty so stop grinnin'
You just diggin' a deeper ditch
You hidin' in the dugout from the feature chick
I'll put cha' lights out, pitch fast or slow
Collabo, So So, whatever I spit on
Is goin' goin gone
I'm Sammy Sosa on the vocals
And white socks and afros are my accessories, worth a fortune
Please believe if ya checkin' for me
I got wants and needs that consist of big thangs baby


Let me tell ya bout So So
You should thank me, I'm no joke
Like the Yankees
I'm so funky, that it's stankie
My wrist so chunky
That people stare at it and be like naw, it can't be
But it is and it shall be forever more
J.D. made me wealthy, now I chase the dough
You can't help me if ya paper low
If you broke it's unhealthy, we can't grow
I'ma be on my own these days
If you don't like it you can go away
Relocate, it's OK, hit the pavement
I'm Chicago Cub'n it and Atlanta Brave'n it
This is my covenant, you can not invade it
And I cannot be faded
So try to just eradicate it from ya brain
Go get a job at the hot dog stand
I need big thangs boo, you don't like that
I don't give a fuck, fuck you


Game right, hit cha' a home run
Strike out a few times, it's all good
You gon' learn something like that
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Hit all three of them bases
And swing it on home baby
So So Def styel, Brat-tat-tat

Ya dig",https://genius.com/Da-brat-ball-game-lyrics

One to the Two, it ain't a thing for da brat to give it to you
Three to the Four in ninety-six Brat hit your ass with a whole lot more

Ay, when I step inside your party yo I turn dat bitch out
Let em know what i'm about this is my fuckin' house
The uncompatible, capital B eyes stay chinky
From da green inhaled into my body
All spot lookers kill ya search cuz this block on lock
And plus dem little bitches you got don't want no work
Not even to come in contact with
Its ritual to da death that we don't tolerate no wack shit and thats it
All da way crunk half drunk off da remi
Makin' niggas jump speakers pump is all dats in me
Spittin' shit like a semi-auto don't never stop getting cheese
Is da motto you's follow drinking straight from da bottle
Attitude is shitty very inqwery kitty holdin' down the windy city
West side thats right I ain't got no time for joy jappin'
Test me and watch me make something happen

Das right....umhmm, Brat make it happen....
Well....umhmm, I like that, well make it happen...hey

Uh, she was the one to make it happen when dat bitch went platinum
Ain't nothing average about the magic between me and da mike and da actin'
When asking a question who put it to the test check the record
Hit top hottest rap and r&b single July second
In ninety-four you flew the funk in, ninety-six back again
Committed some moe sinnin' fuckin' up most men and women
The bad seed with mad weed follow no fuckin' leader
True believer in da factor can't no motherfucka beat her
Keep ya feet up Brat bout to sweep up, niggas can leap up
And creep up still stay beneath her
Cuz she bust and what to death discuss they between us
Take precaution prepare to bite da dust and just take dat shit as a lost
Collect billboard and soul train awards from my trouble
Crappin' you motherfuckas out and coming back for double
Nice on da dice sippin on Hen and ice da time is right

Yo, (ok) kids I was sittin on the block the other day man
Some fine ass girl walked by
And she was lookin, I'm lookin back
She said uh ""JD I love those 20's on your car""
I said I beg your motherfuckin pardon
Them is Michael Jordan's baby
She gotta understand the type of nigga you dealin with
A young, fly, flashy So So Def representer
The biggest thing in the city since Martin Luther the King
Uh, holla at 'em

Brooklyn is what I'm reppin
Disrespect and bullets fly in your direction
Ridin shotgun with JD I got so so connections
Locos and the chrome blows, homie not to mention
I got four homes that I own, I'm certified pimpin
Cross my path, shots blast instant
Extort your ass the kid got henchmens
The whole Brooklyn for instance
Red dot, ruthless, head shots stop you from thinkin
A best seller's what I'm inkin
Another Brooklyn classic, straight acid, keep listenin
Twin Desert Eagles, duck when I'm twistin 'em
Rims spin on sick vehicles, look we killin 'em
Manson and gas my adrenaline, racin fast
Switchin four lanes with weight up in the stash
I'm livin so so better now, the so so dash
Is what I'm sittin on, blowin up so so fast

Yeah, uh huh
Yo, You really don't wanna get hit
Hot lid when I empty the clip
Drop kid if you droppin your lip
Never know enough about but I talk shit
You must wanna eat up my clit
Everything we ever did on is sick
We don't have a party, we rich
We cut it up with anybody we with
And I'm the main one, havin to fit
Can't nobody do it like this
I got a gat by the side like my man Big
Stand out on that song he did with me
You feelin the presence of So So Def
Rest assure we gettin the money, crush your label there's no more left
Just fables fictional characters I
Stay away from those who embellish the truth and LIE
I'm kickin the same shit you been used to since ""Funkdafied""
Let your mind escape, you layed away back and enjoy the RIDE
Yeah, I'm rollin on deuce trays
Shoot all my Tequila straight
Catch me at the bar of the bay
I might even buy you a little drank
We been choppin paper for years
Ain't scared of you niggas out here
Some of ya'll might think we disappear
But everytime the resurgence is clear

Yo, yo
Brooklyn has to be two of the illest
Felons to be diluted I do whatever, to foot it
Like I wanna do it, like I do it
When I done it

My fundamentals of a street life nigga
Cuffin her hair, have it over left, nothin to fear, BIATCH!

Warriorz! (WARRIORZ), Come out and play! (COME OUT AND PLAY)
From the dark side, where we reside, we die for (BK)
We a whole different breed of men, you need to squeeze us in
We'll get in where we fit in like BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK-BUK
Still rockin what's poppin, you still lookin shooken
We a long way from the day when you overlook Brooklyn
It's like lotto Duke the way we represent it
You really gotta be in it to present it, you get it?

Ain't nobody stuck up cuz we all wanna holla
We all wanna party till tomorrow
Lets follow the yellow red road to mah humble abode
Trip over the ninety way take off all of our clothes
Kiss most of me right away because I'm about to explode
And if you don't know, know you know
Nigga I'm sickning and I never get with
When I retire I'll be crushed up like a old battle ship
I'ma put the dip in your hip from right to left
It's that ghetto ass bitch and I'm so so def
It could get drastic don't fuck around and get ur ass kicked
Cuz I have never been faithfully uplasted

Don't touch me cuz you get fucked up (just a lil)

Sippin on bub? lighten up a tree
Its tight enough the place for me so I tight on doves?
Security still had to squeeze niggeaz like chokin on doves wit me
Smokein on mah chronic cuz it's straight from cali
If I'm provoking you, do you, cuz I gotta do me
Stay focused on the doe wit mah family
I need to live all good, I need to sleep all good
I need to know who the niggas in mah neighborhood, in mah neighborhood
So shit if anything happens if sumthin goes down

Whatever the fuck I wanna bring up and string up
My a f one laces would you niggeaz stay out of our faces

That's fucked up
I let yo' ass in when I shoulda kept you locked out
But it's all gravy
It happen to all of us, you know?
You get hurt, you hurt back
You reap what you sow

In the beginning when I met you
I didn't mean to be rude, but I had to sweat you
Cuz you had me wet ooh
I couldn't let you get away
When will I see you again? Another day
Your face was all I needed to see on a daily basis
And my heart in your hands would make it all gravy
But I was mistaken highly
You slid shit right by me
Bein' deceitful and hiding keepin' secrets but still keepin' me smilin'
Inviting hoes to your party
Lord knows I don't wanna get started I'ma hurt somebody
Regardless I'ma love you for what we been through
But keepin' you is somethin' I can't do

If you get somebody
Not just anybody
Get somebody, who gonna be like nobody
Get somebody
Don't tell everybody
Cuz somebody
Gon' try to crash yo' party

As much as I miss ya
I can't get wit' cha
We painted a perfect picture
But I can see clearer now that the rain is gone
But the pains still come on strong
Every so often I get discombabulated
Call in Miss Cleo to see what the tarot cards are sayin'
Hopin' that she know how to help a bitch out or suttin'
Hopin' that she know a lucky number to come up on motherfuckers that keep frontin'
I'm no fool, you only get one strike here
You blew it so I won't be right here
The best friend you claimed you ever had is gone
And it happened because you left me alone


And now that it's over that predicament
Taught me to be a soldier and stay at attention
Fo' my ?
And keep hollerin' at the rich niggas that keep me shoppin'
I'm better now than ever now
You never found somebody quite like me to stay down
Whatever its meant to be, it be that
And whether it's sent to be, it be that

HOW MUCH TIME YOU THINK I'VE GOT
THE CLOCK IS TICKIN' AND TICKIN'

AND THE WAY YOU FUCKING THE HONEYS ON THE BLOCK, STOP
CAUSE IF I GOTTA DROP KICK A HOE, I'LL KILL HER FOR SURE
THEY STICK AROUND UNTIL THE MURDER OCCURS
HOW YOU GONNA CREEP WITH ME AND SLEEP WITH HER
AT THE MOMENT OF TIME WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS
MY VISION MUST HAVE BEEN BLURRED
CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU DESERVED TO LOSE
THE NERVE OF FOOLS, SHIT
PEOPLE WERE SAYING WITH A CERTAINTY
BUT I CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D TAKE IT
TO THE DEGREE OF HURTIN' ME, PURPOSELY
WE REHEARSED TO BE HUSBAND AND WIFE
SO I DEDICATED MY LIFE TO YOU
WHY
SO YOU COULD KEEP A CHICK ON THE SIDE
AND FLIP THE 5-SPEED, THE DICK ON THE SIDE

Immortal Beloved (Outro),MTV’s Hip Hopera Soundtrack: Carmen,UnKnown,"Uh
And that's the story, no life no more, just the loss
Caught up in between the negative and positive force
Carmen Brown, sad tale of a life cut short
Who will take the responsibility when the guns go off?
On one side you have Hill, he got to live with the guilt
Is he the one that she needed or the one that got a kill?
Or is it Carmen to blame for her own downfall?
Did she play with his heart and never loved him at all?
It doesn't matter now because she is resting in peace
And all the playas in the game have to live with the grief
It's only now that she's gone, you will truly discover

Cos I'm the coldest human being that you've heard thus far
My rhymes is more hotter, I still pack a whole lotta
Nobody can't touch Shawntae the showstopper
I do my thang with a ? swang
The lyrics I bring keeps the niggas hating
And to the tick-tock ya don't stop
Would ya believe I ain't never left the scene
I coulda stayed in your face but I waited in the wings
Patiently til the coast was clear, some hoes ain't gon' have no hope this year
When I kill it I murder it dead, sippin' on some remi uh!
As for my competition find them in the hospital bed nigga
Wishin' they ain't had no confrontation with Brat
Trippin' they whole body, mummy wrapped, up in the cask
Gotta sip through a straw now and piss in they pants

Ain't nothin' basic about me I'm the livest one
I'm on fire, now I see why ya, bitches wanna bite me like a vampire
It's just the way that I am, really don't give a damn
From the fat on your back it's a fact that you wack
And you wanna be Da Brat
That'll never happen come on! That's suicide
You might as well put your neck in a noose
Take ten vicaden and chase it wit grey goose

And they can watch me drive up
And it's written all over they face
They know the place about to get liver
'Cause when I enter the building I give these niggas a feeling
Like ""Oh my God, is it really who I think it is?""
They 'bout to get fired up
And start sendin' me bottles before I make it to my table
Like I ain't already made reservations in V.I.P
With a couple of cases there waiting on me
I'm fly as fuck
So they start comin' at me trying to spit that game
If it's lame I'ma they Daytona Tired off
Then I gotta walk away
Cause I'm headed to the DJ booth, he drink Grey Goose
Gotta make sho' he's straight, cause he cool

Out of another dimension when I perform
Killin off your family if they don't finish me
Full of energy, make 'em a memory soon as I get warm
Show 'em all I'm the truth
Put me in a straitjacket, because I throw up in the booth
Eyes roll up back in my head
'Finna be vivid and when I'm mental
I'm makin' a nigga not know what to do and I think
Everybody hate me! Now I'm finna murder 'em all
But what I spit so cold, it's the crazies
Watch as I get dumb, bust a verbal dum dum
Make a motherfucker run like a dog with rabies

Leavin' heads that be talkin' shit spattered on porches

Hands in Da Air,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Niggas always watchin' me
(Funky)
But I want 'em to keep on watchin' me
I'ma keep give 'em sumthin' to see
(Smokin')
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me, watchin' me
Could it be the way I'm still tight?
Niggas that didn't use to feel me jockin' me, jockin' me
The, whole world got too much money for me
To not get no dough, dough, can't no hoe
Rock harder than the one from so-so
I never go broke, broke
I keep comin with the vocals that make most know
Why the fuck I boast, boast and brag
Why should I look sad that I got some loot now?
In fact, I knew how
Watch when I back the Coupe out
Can niggas just troop out?
The same way they do when I show you Brat
With a little bit of boobs out
And her big ass protrude out
Get the news out
Some of you bitches lose out
When the sexiness ooze out
Like orgasms, I'm the best at this
Throwin' tantrums when I move into makin' shit
If you thinkin' of becomin' one of my favorites
You gotta pay a bitch 'cause I be stayin' rich
I ain't quittin', quittin'
Way before, ""Funkdafied"" I was spittin', spittin'
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
If y'all wanna see me, see me
I'm give y'all somethin' to look look at
Make a nigga neck turn turn for Brat
Burn burn these hoes 'cause I'm back and my pants still sag
It's automatic, they wanna jump on my wagon, wagon
I ain't lackin', lackin' on shit
Open ya eyes when my body when I try on clothes that fit fit
I'm articulate and particulate on who I let hit hit
And get up in the middle of the center of my tootsie roll
Roll me something to smoke smoke and burn slow slow
Don't keep it a secret, tell all ya folks
See you when I shine, I glow, glow
From the C H I C A G O, 60644
And I trust no, nigga that make a mistake for me
Guns ready to blaze and to leave with you
Some of the ones run
I can't control my trigger finger when it pump, pump
Stay out the way when I come come
It's guaranteed to bump, bump the trunk, uh
And put a hump in ya back
If niggas is askin' who's thumpin', it's Brat Brat
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
I keep my bad braids back when puttin' the dick on the track
You can turn it down playa, we don't listen to that
The bass don't thump, we spit on crap
That beat ain't tight nigga, that shit ain't fat
Every time that shit come out, I toss it back and I slap
I be breakin' ya back to the rhythm of rap
 test it loud for the low frequency, where it's at?
Niggas say, ""I love that fuckin' shit ya did wit Da Brat!""
Actin' bad with the pad, with the pen, with the paper
Still smoke a nigga under the table
Put the lines in the words and the hooks and the phrases
Instead of puttin' out sumthin' that's blazin'
Get ya hand out my pocket, get ya foot out ya mouth
And ya head out ya ass
And keep ya nose out my business
And I mean it, goddammit, 'cause I'm fiddinta get mad
I put 'em in the trash bag
Twist tie, put 'em out Monday and Wednesday
I kick 'em in they raggely ass
Take money from 'em and you know I better get some
I know it ain't fair
But I smoke with alligators and I wrestle with bears
Throw ya hands in the air
As high as you can and leave them bitches there
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere
Forever you playas playas flash on 'em
Get cash on 'em
And make 'em say, say
Hands in the air, from side to side
Forever I'm high, high
Together we ride, ride
I'm never too tired to get that paper, baby
Throw yo' hands in the air like you don't care
This fo' niggas and bitches everywhere

Ain't no stoppin me, naw, 'cause I'm on fire like a cigarette
Get higher when the beat quick nigga we hit
Shittin on niggas to heeze on em just to eat quick

Cooked and cleaned like a hebrew slave, till i got blisters, a modern day miss ceelie, and he was my mister
But i woke up one day, started to get real slick called a couple of my friends with a few scenarios, felt like a dance with the devil, didn't like being happily married no more, had to go real quick, cause its my time, and i done made up my mind shawntae gotta leave you behind, and get my dough cause half of that??s mine, and my drow to help me the daughter sunshine, you thought i wouldn't make it but i'm livin proof, do on to others as you'd have mothafuckas do on to you

I was sitting at the table, V.I.P., inebriated
Got so many bottles round me' Got me six thousands in the '80s
So I keep myself surrounded by some moguls making paper
If you're lame, I can't fuck with you
Cause you are no motivator!
Ladies love me, boys adore me
I mean even the ones that never saw me like
You're so cool, you're so cute
You're so uh, I wanna roll with you!
Gimmie the digits and I'll sing you a text
I'll let you know what's next, what's next, what's next?
Follow the leader who for years been giving you heaters
You'll be a masochist in the'

Somebody about to go home

So I'm casing my surroundings and my goal with great time force
I'm the incredible, edible, aries spiece
The beauty ain't my flaw, nigga beast
The beauty of that, was it increased?
So I keep a hundred grands in my seat
Rubber bands in the backpack, yeah, we are asleep
Head to the back, in the bach
In the Caddy with a drop or the jeep

Tryin to do the Dougie

Look at all that ASS! Anyway
I don't smoke, but if I did
I guess it's time to puff, puff pass

But I'm back in the back and the fact is I'm GREAT!

To go on give me a release date, February 28th
Now I'm home on the phone, twenty-fo'

And do more damage than I have ever done
I'm capable of lyrically assassinatin a hater
I fascinate 'em for the hell of it I make it fun

With a hundred muh'fuckers, all Louisville sluggers
Ain't na'ar a one of us no suckers
Ain't na'ar a one of us no busters, or, hustlers
Yeah how I gotta get cause I gotta get it
While the gettin gettin good, lil' engine that could
Came from the bottom with nuttin up out the hood
I ain't fin' ta let nuttin stop it, I wish I would
Even though I'm labelled a crimi-nal, I'm a better individu-al
Look at me now, feet on the ground
People around, supporters
Surround myself with the most important, I'm fortunate
I'm scorchin it; and for the record ain't nobody better
I'm hotter than ever and I'm torchin this
Aesthetic to be recordin this, hypothetically and phonetic
When I'm at it, me at the mic married
Like me and Mariah Carey, steadily stay ready
Heavily goin steady, happily ever after
Begin a new chapter, back at'cha
It's the B to the R-A-T, nuff camera

I got a lot of thug in me - huh, it's cockiness
Now I got a lot of thug in me, with his cock in this
Huggin me, tellin me he feelin like
He fin' to fall in love with me
Tellin me that I'm the one
And everything so right he wants to be stuck with me
My occupation is to motivate him
And cultivate his mind frame to my type frame
All through the night to the early
I'm a rider like I'ma nigga talkin dirty
But be ready to put work in

But you can't stop there
Music still playin, in the background
No, and you're almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here
Baby I'ma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go! Motivation
Go, go, go, go!

Yeahhhh! Y'all know what this is, yo
I know I got your curiosity wonderin
Cause my swag so turned up
Am I gon' take control or be a little bit passive
I'm very passionate 'bout when I fuck
Face down, ass up, satisfactory no matter what
Main attraction when I'm makin love
All action, don't yell and cuss
Nobody with me never get bored
Nominate me for a V award
Best actress in the outdoors
On the matress or on the floors
In the ocean or on the shore
My emotions make you want more
Ye ain't never had it like this befo'
So you can't compare me to no previous hoe
I'm mo' thirst quenchin than a jug of water
Motivate ya wind ya 'til it's out of order
You'll want more than a friendship when it's over
Cause I don't just ride or die, I'm a soldier
""Stand By Me,"" Sam Cooke
My whole army leave a man shook
But I ain't really lookin for no kind of relations
If you need me doe, I can be your motivation

But you can't stop there
Music still playin, in the background
No, and you're almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here
Baby I'ma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go! Motivation
Go, go, go, go!

Whoa lover, When you call my name
No other! Can do that the same, no
I won't let ya, get up out that game no
So go on lover, go on and make me rain
And when we're done, I don't wanna feel my... legs
And when we're done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby

But you can't stop there
Music still playin, in the background
No, and you're almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here
Baby I'ma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go! Motivation
Go, go, go, go!",https://genius.com/Da-brat-motivation-lyrics
