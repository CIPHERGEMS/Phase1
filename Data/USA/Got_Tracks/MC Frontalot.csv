You got to click, close

Just got hard-pressed underneath my desk
No jest! It’s time Frontalot confessed:
At the best of times, got the worst of rhymes
And I don’t think I’m the first to find
My life devoted less to lyrics
Than it is to my struggle for pyrrhic
Victory in the race to be
The interweb’s number one devotee
Of smutty little things that occur onscreen
(Risqué to — hey! — quintuple-x obscene):
MILFs who shave themselves so cleanly;
Twins in positions unseemly
My spleen ain’t the part that gets vented
I grabbed a hold and fapped like I meant it
Distended, probably oughta leave it alone
Spend more time stroking on the microphone

Got a boatload of midgets and they’re in command
Of a full-grown woman on her knees and hands
Got a long hard donkey and a farm girl too
And the braying’s so dismaying when he starts to spoo
Got to click close, put it away
‘Cause the internet is f-i-l-t-h-y

Lurking in #pass chans on the IRC
Got DCC’d unexpectedly
With an 80-minute XviD: Nuns In Heat
Part III: Bad Habits. I’m so leet
That I had that one already
Skipped to the part with the fishnet teddy
Whipped it out, but to my chagrin
One toss from a win when the boss walked in
Said “nuh-uh Front, that terminal ain’t
For a latex crucifix spanking a taint
In big 32-bit color
While them rosary beads get yanked out the cruller.”
I said “you can’t fire me; I quit!”
Opened up the case, yanked out the hard disk
Absconded, all with the data in hand:
31 years of Hustler scans;
Plans for how to construct a love-swing;
Alt.binaries.everything
Archived since spring of ’92;
Receipt for my RealDoll’s stripper shoes;
Tools for an online poll I ran
(Vote once, tub girl or goatse man);
Glands galore, explore for hours;
Diaper play and golden showers;
Glory hole video, deep as it gets;
Mpegs of an heiress that she ought regret
Cap’d on cam from a hijacked feed
Half a terabyte, so whatcha need?
Got grannies in the front, trannies in the back
Red on brown on blond on black
Ganged up, tied up, all alone:
Every delectation to which I’m prone

Got the Japanese schoolgirl tentacle love
Got the furries in a flurry, they been yiffing it up
Got a Craigslist poster trading poo for pee
Got a deep dark dungeon full of hot bi Swedes
Got to click close, put it away
‘cause the internet is f-i-l-t-h-y
Click close, put it away
Cause the internet is f-i-l-t-h-y
Gotta click close
Gotta click close

Goth Girls,Nerdcore Rising,2005.0,"Goth girls, goth girls: they're the girls that go
To see the nerdcore rapper with the geeked out flow
At the show, you can see the black lace on parade
I met a hundred dozen of 'em...

Ummmm hello! I was wondering, how goth is my frock?
I got this thing for horror movies and mope rock
But I can't shock my hair up (I ran out of stock)
And just like that, Frontalot ran out of talk
It was tragic, unheard of, never seen, me:
Out of rhymes when they usually come indefatigably
But me here talk good? No, bad talk do!
Like my tongue got encrypted right before I lost root
Like my small talk got box-roxed on a prior boot
It's moot, she only dates guys in chokes and Docs
Not brutes lacking eye-liner like I lack
But look, I'll put a little on plus lip shellac
Just to stand next to that and dream about love
Of necessity, that has always had to be enough
Cause I can't talk to goth girls, I just stare and stammer
""My name is MC frimmer frammer.""
Damn her if she giggle, damn her double if she laugh
Goth girls like it when you double-damn it twice fast

Goth girls, goth girls: they're the girls that go
To see the nerdcore rapper with the geeked out flow
At the show, you can see the black lace on parade
I met a hundred dozen of 'em but I ain't got laid

Got shunned by her at the Rocky Horror premiere
She steered clear of the nerd crowd but I heard loud in my ear
The disdain that she held for my type
Always geeking on the computron — I get hype
On the stage, she might notice me then and observe
That I'm ""ironically hip in some flip universe""
And her purse in patent leather held in fishnet glove
Could then contain MP3 player with the Front filled up
Her name is Nyteshaed, yo don't call her cherry tomato
She look like Paisley Tinkle but poisonous like Topato
She says her hair got attacked cause it's black and it's blue
She got the Johnny the Homicidal Maniac tattoo
Legs all deep in the boots, boots all up on the heels
Yes, the kind to make a certain type of fetishist squeal
The ordeal I endure: this close to her splendor
Besieged by my shyness; try this: I surrender!
And render my intentions in the usual way
(Home alone, SuicideGirls up on the cathode ray.)

Goth girls, goth girls: they're the girls that go
To see the nerdcore rapper with the geeked out flow
At the show, you can see the black lace on parade
I met a hundred dozen of 'em but I ain't got laid

IRL, my woman tells me that I shouldn't be covetin'
I tell her ""Yo, you better get in a coven then.""
It's like ""Eek!"", I get to sleep on the couch for a week
While watching old Elvira videos on TV
Yeah hee hee hee; laugh it up. You don't live like I do:
At the mercy of any sister with wrist scars and black eye goo
I've tried to get into cheerleaders and failed
Banana Repugnant and tanned, so bland and so stale
Avail myself of the local café, light a clove up
Thumb through Camus (in French, which I can't read, but so what?)
I think that goth could flower in nerdcore's embrace
I mean I converted Edward Gorey's lettering into a typeface
Befriended vampires on LJ and MySpace
Even put that spooky echo filter on the bass
But I can't talk to goth girls, I just stare and stammer
""My name is MC frimmer frammer.""
Damn her if she giggle, damn her double if she laugh
Goth girls like it when you double-damn it twice fast

Goth girls, goth girls: they're the girls that go
To see the nerdcore rapper with the geeked out flow
At the show, you can see the black lace on parade
I met a hundred dozen of 'em but I ain't got laid
Goth girls, goth girls: they're the girls that got
Their souls stuck somewhere between the kettle and pot
Frontalot been enamored of 'em since I was young
Met a hundred dozen of 'em, never ever humped one",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-goth-girls-lyrics
I’ll Form the Head,Solved,2011.0,"Bright-colored robotic space rhinoceri
That we pilot — why? Cause they're in supply
Plus, we heed the cry of our planet's population
To defend them. We report to battle stations
Split screen — ready — and our rhinos are rocket ships
With fully articulated tusk, jaws, and hips
They come equipped with individual special attacks
None with a lag, but a couple a little bit slack
I'm not naming any pilot specifically
But we're all color-coded so you notice that typically
I, in the gold, lead the charge, do the most damage
To whatever hairy giant space invader managed
To threaten the globe in yet another of our episodes
This week? Malevolent galactic nematode!
Already beat up the squad when we faced him
I'm calling it: let's form a giant robot and waste him

Monster misbehaving
Planet's needing saving
Situation's grave and
I'll form the head
The enemy is clever
We're smaller but whatever
When we put it together
I'll form the head
Y'all can do the treading
Swing energy machete
If combination's ready
I'll form the head
I'll form the head
I'll form the head

What the deuce, Pink? What'd I tell you last time?
Got my agent on the phone, watch it with the worm slime
And watch a star shine. Focus in your cameras
Cause it's a damn crime, being so glamorous
Now pan it, yeah at us, shot of the supreme
Mister Quoise Rhinobot. Them? My lackey team
You got the nimrod with the yellow laser beam
And the other guy's otaku (and he wants to talk to me)
Between scenes, sometimes I feel out of place
Oh yeah, I'm the biggest damn star in outer space
Dear fans, I am powered by your flattery
Love, little old me (not the diva or the daiquiri)
Back on track, team! And if you require me
To show some pearly whites, I'll remind you why you hired me
There's no rivalry, just me instead
I'll be back in fifteen, just in time to form the head


Am I the only one who's finding this peculiar
That fighting giant aliens is getting too familiar?
And it's bad enough, and just my luck, my bot is lightish red
But do we always have to argue over who should form the head?
NASA-trained, I'm only overlooked cause I'm the nice guy
I'm overqualified, I've logged six months of flight time
Astrophysicist, but still there's no respect for me
The Golden Boy and Quoise couldn't spell the word trajectory
Now they have me face-to-face and fighting with some fish bait
Ten minutes left? We'll never finish at this rate
We need a plan, re-running through other enemies
But every battle has two-minute breaks within the memory
All these giant insects, they put the world in jeopardy
I remember MegaMoth as if it happened yesterday
I think it's time that we combine and rip this thing to shreds
But only if you promise me that I can form the head!


Pink! Turquoise! Stick together! Some say
UltraMegafauna only clicks together one way
If that is apocryphal, might offer you turns
Up top, where the view's at, you can look stern
While we pose so menacingly, brandishing blade
About to rid us of the enemy with one swoop - Yayyy!
- Not now! Time's critical. Don't debate this again
Oops! That space worm gobbled up Michigan!

It got narrated at

in the second person
Every time you booted up, it seemed you got another version
Of your life 
told to you by a status line blinking
The impossible people you could be without thinking
Yourself insane of personality problems
With a mop on a drop ship
 or 
trying to stab a goblin
That don’t play in public life.
 You get arrested
Psychoactive medication daily in your big intestine
And attesting that the voices in your head
Said the dwarf shot first, embedded arrow then you bled
But doctors with needles posit repeatedly
That you knocked down that midget in the park unneededly
This has seeded the idea that you should
Never venture from the house
, never get misunderstood
By the 
non-player characters
 inhabiting Earth
None of whom are too concerned about
 
Nord & Bert
Not one of whom ever aimed a fish around the room
Trying to get it in the ear canal because doom
Beset the last planet they were on

near
The verge of a set of poetics they wouldn’t hear
Never peered at the clues with invisible ink
No 
SM goddesses
 ever gave them pause to think
Never piloted six robots, each distinct
Don’t matter how many 2-liters they drink
They’re not gonna follow what you’re saying at all

Offers cursor and prompt: type >run and you’re running
And parses what you tell it,

Abbreviations if you need ‘em (better keep it grammat.)
Better punctuate your sentences and never redact
The name of anything ambiguous
. 
You’re about to get asked
Do you mean the red one, the round one, the crooked, or the blue?
Better keep that in your pocket, don’t know yet what it could do
Could be the spray for the grue; you’re gonna need it if it is

A situation that reloads, restarts, or quits
Wonder how many points out of how many points
You’ve got to get before you’re done

Endeavor then to rejoice
When you wish more ardently, identities shed
For continuance,
 
the rhyme forever voyaging.
 
Fled
From all lights and colors, from all smells and sound:
Just the lyric on the monochrome display and you’re proud
To make another verse appear by solving riddles

You’d be ever in the middle and the midst of a quest
If it weren’t for

wrists bear the brunt

some sands that were Egyptian
And I retain plane tickets, snapshots, receipts
Yet I stand unconvinced that this has happened to me
I wouldn’t want to misremember or get confused
Recall of crawling towards a pyramid appearing over dunes
Recall of entering the thing and descending stairs
Does it descend from there, adventure to nightmare?
Did I battle a snake? Was the treasure intact?
Or did the 
TRS-80
 in my brain get hacked?
Thanks, Grampa, for buying it.
 Now my life’s ruined

First World Problem,Zero Day,2010.0,"Nerd rap infests your internet, you left a trap, but it's empty
MC Frontalot took a gape but the bait wasn't tempting
Ending up uncaged and at large
To talk smack at you through the networking appliance that's in charge
Of every drip of your attention
Yo, when mine goes out I've got to log in just to mention
My disappointment at the interruption of convenience
I mean just: a lot left, but none up in between this
Couple of minutes here and a couple of minutes later
It's an outrage, at the price I paid
These dictators Of my leisure rule with an iron fist
Has anybody ever been so put upon as this?

Your GPS run out of battery (first world problem)
Got to wake up Saturday (first world problem)
You just delayed a honeymoon (first world problem)
Pledge season's coming soon (first world problem)
Half your friend list is spam accounts (first world problem)
And your center channel speaker's out (first world problem)
Your center channel speaker's out (I can hear that it's not on)

Muffy, my hair regrowth cream is mostly ineffective
And I'm struggling to keep this in perspective
But I feel like a massive injustice occurred
Says ""regrows hair"" on the tube (in the words)
In a third — or maybe a quarter — of all users
I must have got swindled, is it a fault? Of whose is?
Oooh, Muffy, Muffy, I had all the servants tortured
Did you keep them on retainer? Do you got some more on order?
Cause I can't comb my hair on my own no more
I got accustomed to the lifestyle, sniffed upon the spore
And it molded up my innards, made the blood turn blue
Muffy, Muffy, there's a revolution; what we're gonna do?

Misplaced the Ambien (first world problem)
Left a participle dangling (first world problem)
You're scheduling your root canal (first world problem)
Your grad schooling had no rationale (first world problem)
You didn't like your appetizer (first world problem)
Your yacht got capsized (a first world problem)

The living conditions of the American masses (that's you)
Are swiftly deteriorating
Our generation is going through the final convulsions
Of the dying world of capitalism
That's what it says here
And if you don't believe that pamphlet
Try this one:

Now while our capitalism is in a minor kerfuffle
You have to hustle before the fates come, reshuffle
Rustle up another couple grievances and air 'em
You can laugh about it later (maybe needed while despairing)
For the moment though, you ordered half caf, didn't get it
There was no TV set when you jetted; Internet resetted
Itself just as I was in the middle
Of tournament play, and so I suffered from transmittal
Interruption. Completely ruined my day

People buy CDs in these days of disaster
So poor me: I have to be a professional rapper

Nerdcore Rising,Nerdcore Rising,2005.0,"Nerdcore could rise up
It could get elevated
Nerdcore could rise up
It could get elevated

Nerdcore used to be just a made-up word
MCs shied away from belief, rest assured
They sleep hard no longer, we deliver the hits
That give the kids with the spectacles spectacular fits
I seen one nerd foam at the mouth in his glee
It was me, in the mirror, rhyming, brushing my teeth
And now the heezy we’s off don’t babble 300 baud
I get no error while compiling my rhyme The slipshod
Rap stylings of the hip kids continue to vex;
They get sex, money, power, but their jams are like flecks
Of sea foam against the great reef of my boredom
I seen them trying to act cool; ignored them
Scored some geeked out beats and a mic
Some jugglers I kick it with don’t even know I rap — it’s alright
For soon the whole nerdcore will congregate
In culmination of the monkey going acaudate

The nerdcore could rise up, it could get elevated
Oh, and wouldn’t all of those tough rappers hate it
If the nerdcore rose up and got elevated?
We consider the possibleness of this not overstated

We put our styles in the blender and the tape on our spectacles
We compile the assembler; we’d each make a respectable
Egon Spengler; your despicable, heckling, snide remarks make it
All the more delectable to mark a Jeckyl & Hyde departure from the
Larger norm or previous status quo, the clever dicks
Like us apply the baddest flow to limericks, and that is no mere
Rhetoric. We don’t just wreck shop, we mop the shop floor
With rappers who romanticize their third eyes when we’ve got four
Each, and we exceed your reach, we’re world wide
Webslingers with the combined military might of the Girl Guides
Dead ringers for the lone gunmen, or maybe Jonathan, Andrew and
Warren from Season Six of BtVS, we’re geniuses and we’re devious
We’re seen as fresh on the BBS where we write graf in ascii files
With nasty styles and blinking blocks
This ain’t your father’s Lincoln Logs!
The Frontalot ownz j00, and Stephen Hawking r0x0rs
We’re not even talking solely to cats with argyle in their sock drawers
Our styles got the top score spot, yours did not, sorry!
Stick to the shockwave games, lickin’ shots at the top
Forty! I made my own Doom .wads, dickwad
My own sprites and .mus files, I stayed home nights...


Nerd: when you say it you best say it with awe
‘cause I’m the type of nerd that will bust your jaw
A nerdcore player, I’ve paid my dues
Got lowered suspension and chromed out shoes
Hear ye hear ye, in case you ain’t heard
20-aught-5 be the year of the nerd
Nerdcore’s gonna be crazy large
And we the N.I.C. bitch, the Nerds In Charge
We bust more rhymes than Theodor Geisel did
Got more game than a 2600
For punk MCs who playa-hate
We got one word: EXTERMINATE!
Just a matter of time before we’re household names
So you best suck up now before fortune and fame
Put our asses out of reach of your quivering lips
As we ride to the top on a nerdcore tip


And I know that possibleness is not a cromulent word;
Every syllable injected is intended to be the one you heard
(an absurd juxtaposition of mission and goal)
Frontalot: about to roll
His diploma up tight and smoke it
Nerdcore’s about to sit there unless you poke it
You want to prod it? See if it’ll kick?
While the smart kids calculate the hip-hop shit?
Got a vast network of subversives & criminals
Who sit in front the screens, all heedless of ridicule
These days, the complexion cleared up but the rhyming remains
Still ain’t nobody knows my name
And I think the same thought with great regularity:
That I’m the best MC that I can bear to be
And I’m scared to be either doper or dorkier
Bound for the high road even if it looks forkier...",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-nerdcore-rising-lyrics
Zero Day,Zero Day,2010.0,"They take the world over one node at a time
They put the seed in some software and make it shine
So the dimwitted among us grab tight and install

That the celebration of a day impends
I want to note it on the calendar, I ready my pen
I get ahead of my friends in my haste, I let slip
That the zero day is coming, MC Front still ill-equipped
Boom how it hits you, when it comes
If you're touching on an interface you steady your thumbs
Since you might have to jump ship quick, the sting stuns
It isn't designed to destroy, it's just how it runs
And I sing fun songs but this here is a warning
That the exploit's open and it might sound corny
But I give a damn about the state of the Earth

And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late
And on the first day, it's already too late, it's already too late, it's already too late

Press play, prepare as history is made:
""Largest hack in one day,"" all the headlines will say
All out of time, hear the chime from the buzzer
Found this bug on my own, no need for a fuzzer
""It's already too late,"" spreading as we planned
No need for the NO OPs, I know just where to land
Clearing out the registers, with pointers to my functions
Loaded to your memory and writing new instructions
Braindump I/O, siphoned out the eye holes
Enticed so I'm digging through the disassembled byte code
Push pop change order stack frame FILO
Filesystem inodes, all fall to my flow
Running over, there again I go
Self-propagation engine, polymorphic sideshow
Every network, we're found to get around
The exploit payload encoded in this sound


Man, cousin, I'm about to put in the work
Assert authority. Administrative access: crack this
If your patches back in the past, this
0day gets you on a root trip. TrueCrypt
Key file, I will keystyle shell code
Triple sevens all up on the ch mod
Shhh mode, how I'm keeping this here
Cause if I keep my game on tight my 0day lasts another year
You're a little bit late
I had that nfsd back in ninety-eight
And the DCOM bomb owned the Zone Alarm
So get your lip balm kitty; NEDM three fitty
Got them bots in every city with the Spamtec committee
And yt the almighty, zero day beats flying. And who's giant?
That's us. With the upstream plus, we're CAN-SPAM compliant


Yo, when it flips, new world is a permanent state
Cultivate paranoia cause the Huns at the gate
Are many millions strong, all arrive in a spate
YT Crack and Int80 been shipping them freight
All walls up to date, let them come, you can cope

Origin of Species,Secrets from the Future,2007,"Congregation, settle in your seats
The Reverend Front Aloud is on the mic and about to speak
I’m about to freak you out, make you shiver in the pew
While I’m delivering to you my sermon and divinity ensues
Brought by the one true God. It’s a fact:
Anybody else who ever had a God, their God’s wack
We ain’t got to worry about ‘em; we picked the right horse
You’re in the right house of worship (of course)
And forces are gathering out in the world
To diminish our faith in ways radical and thorough
To discourage us from loving anything that’s immaterial
To tempt our children with ever fruitier cereal
And worst of all, to call us idiots while they do it
My congregation, listen; I’m about to walk you through it
We’re going to take the nation back from the heathens that’s within it
We’re gonna get the most egregious of the atheists imprisoned
Cause a schism while we’re at it, but emerge on top
And once we’ve purified our ranks we won’t stop —
We’ll purify your minds of what’s illegitimately thought
It’s not to be a battle indiscriminately fought
But an orchestrated effort, and I’m gonna need you to commit
Might take a couple generations for this deviltry to quit
Start with the kids — in fact, they get distracted from the Lord —
So I’d like you to write a couple letters to your school board

Do you, do you really believe
That we were nothing but them monkeys swinging up in the trees?
Don’t it seem a little likelier that Adam and Eve
Did a lot of humping, and that was the origin of the species?

And what has this so-called science ever done for us
But trumpeted that when ashes go to ashes & dust to dust
Despite the fuss of living, energy gets conserved
Denying the weight of the soul of a man: this is ill deserved
This is still the curse of Copernicus that we suffer
Secular thought ought not to overflow its buffer
And run roughshod through the minds of you, the population
Heretics such as Dawkins and Sagan overstep their station
To say that what we see and what we believe should be confluent
Look to your Reverend to end apostasy — that’s what I’m doing!
Look to your Holy Book to light the way; that is its purpose
Open it up and you’ll find Eden ‘fore you even scratch the surface
And sure, this should be mirrored in the textbooks verbatim
But I’m not in a position yet to issue ultimatum
So I lay down my scheme: we’ll make it seem as though creation
Isn’t anything we’d like to interject to education
We’ll wrangle up the language: science, data, theorem
The irreducible complexity of the ears we use to hear ‘em
Gnashing teeth and wailing from Kansas to PA
Yes, my flock, I talk of futures not imminent but underway
Already established an Institute for Discovery
Discovered that Darwin is dead with outlook grim for recovery
Schoolmarms will soon say that he burns in a fiery sea
Think how much like paradise that’s gonna be

Do you, do you really believe
That we were nothing but them monkeys swinging up in the trees?
Don't it seem a little likelier that Adam and Eve

If you're in Moby Dick then I hope you're not the captain;
If you are, then I urge: rethink revenge
Cause you're headed for the bottom and you're bringing your friends
Fall into Wonderland then you're definitely dreaming
Sleeping by the stream, and all is only seeming
If you're in the Bible, it ends in Armageddon
If you're in the Y2K, it's less upsetting
If you're living in the 80s, spoiler

gay Wham!
Space ships can blow up.
 
Trickle-down economics is a scam
But you'll figure that out
I don't want to wreck the ending for you, make you pout

Say I ruin everything for you — well, it's mutual
In the future, do not do what you do

If you're in the French Revolution, I warn it won't last
If you're in the Kennedy clan, beware a muzzle flash
Airplanes, also, quite often destroyed them
And if you're a Lennon, there's a Chapman.
 Avoid him
Boy when I'm spoiling the ending you frown
No empire lasts forever, go to town
But if you're old Rome, look out for that Nero
In case you're a countdown, look out for zero
Any time you're a ticking bomb, explode
(and nobody make it out except Horatio)
Cause every peanut brittle's got a snake inside
And Jacks-in-the-box, meant to startle, pop high
If you didn't know already, I'll apologize
Peek-a-boo's a game; it's a trick of the eyes
Not a bending of reality itself

Charisma Potion,Zero Day,2010.0,"Fuck you, look at my cool hat
I could be you, stat
I could be anything, anytime
With the right potion, invocation: many rhymes
Expended in the process
Compression so fresh, you wonder am I lossless
Does it cost this too?
Is there any question what I'm willing to do?
Tip the lid off, tilt the flask in hand
Taste like ass but the task is grand
Been the lastest man picked for the kickball
Incoordinate: to hit, I miss a brick wall
That won't help an unpopular pick
Take a swig, now I'm captaining shit
And I'm putting legitimate players on duty
To gather them beauties what thought I had cooties

Is it one attribute you did not roll?
Is it one bottle in the Bag of Hold?
Is it one goal: to pass the stat check?
To sip the extract, you command the respect
Is it one attribute you did not roll?
Is it one bottle in the Bag of Hold?
Is it one goal: to pass the stat check?
To sip the extract, you command the respect

By the CHA on my character sheet
Yes, I pencil a plus; thus, I deem it discrete
From the inked-in single-digit charm that I got
In initial calculations, weighted and fraught
With compromises (not with surprises)
No shock to the misers of points when I'm leveling up
That the prizes all go in one cup (which one?)
INT increased always and didn't start low
Now it got so high, I get to fake the flow
Just by figuring out the simulation and enacting
I get crafty, take a vial's worth exactly
Another couple sips, I'm up on top of the world
Yet another to my lips, the way rhymes get hurled
You'd affix to my person impossible statistic
A temporary boost, it desists quick
Desists quickly
I ought to say quickly, it is an adverb


Yes, you might consider Frontalot an expert in the subject
Soaking in the potion such a length, I make a subset
Of bath-time wrinkles, devote them to this:
Amplification of fabulousness
Take a stab at a dis, note it doesn't connect
So buffed, you don't even need to look up the check
Just hand the dice over, hang the head low
Don't blame it on the Captivation enchantment on the robe
Boots of Beguiling leave a sparkle where I tread
+8 Helm of Glamour merely flatters my head
What I said was: the outfit is ornamental
It's incidental. The elixir's effect is ungentle:
It blends me with confident types
If I lift a toast to them, am I being polite?
To the kids who arbitrated on the topic of cool:
Look at my cool hat and fuck you

Damian, are you saying at-TRIB-ute, or AT-tribute?

Bizarro Genius Baby,Secrets from the Future,2007,"I had a dream that I fathered a bizarro genius baby
She’s out the womb like, dude why’d I get expatriated
Debated at one month the finer points of a diaper
Devised a device composed of a hose and a windshield wiper
Grew riper in intellect as the months passed
Wore a dunce cap ironically
Got fussy once and she summoned me not sonically
But through a series of editorials that she authored
Entitled Is MC Frontalot One Of The Worst Fathers
Oxford, Stanford, Harvard called, she didn’t call them back
Tuition and housing, I’m holding out for a tenure track
Distracted by her first birthday party, I hardly noticed
She’d brought peace to the middle east
 
or at least a cease-fire with the POTUS
And no dust had settled when she disproved Fermat
By finding A^3 + B^3 that = C^3 and her sadness
At throwing the field into disarray got assuaged
By a brand new rattle and a mint parfait

Bizarro genius baby at first I was elated, but eventually I grew concerned
Bizarro genius baby you prove my genes are Grade A, 
but what of when tables turn

She had to settle for the Fields Medal but didn’t settle well
All the while cursing the indiscretions of Madame Nobel
And so well tuckered out was she at this point that she napped
Arose with a whole symphony composed in Bb
See dad, yes dear, it’ll go with the other ones on the fridge
In between the two Puccinis you translated & abridged
Just above I love you dad in macaroni/glitter
And the thirty seven villanelles
 to mom, but I ain’t bitter
And no quitter was she neither when the time it came to walk
Built an exoskeleton out of gelatin and chalk
Which allowed her to run thirty miles an hour
 ‘round the yard
You think that parenting your normal little children is hard
I got scarred, scared, scampered at by holographic artifacts
That she projected on the scene with a machine that automatically
Discerns your worst concerns & makes them visible
She deemed it risible. Her glee was indivisible
From all emanations that the baby would make
I had to become less hilarious for all of our sakes
I made mistakes, I’ll admit it. Dropped the kid on her head
Destroyed the part of her that thought of evil. Or so she said!
Now I bred this thing out myself in part —
She quoted reap what you sow I had to take it to heart
I sought to restart, I said girl you’ll be a woman
Can’t be dabbling and dilettantin’ all the time, I’m assuming
Got to pick a theme and focus the beam of your brain power
Her face became overcome with an insane glower
And then it remained sour. She said oh, I have
Though the UI that you gave me was buggy I finally found me the nav
And I’m dialing in a career path I think you’ll like
Began when I played with an 808 and it ends with a mic
I didn’t need her to elaborate at all
She was already wearing the glasses, mic in the palm
She planned to become a nerdcore rapper just like me
So I shipped her to Singapore, sold her baby ass to Nike",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-bizarro-genius-baby-lyrics

You’ll persist to exist; almost seems like you’re there, don’t it?

Stoop Sale,Solved,2011.0,"I nearly blew right by in my hurry to the subway
When I heard someone say, “Isn’t autumn lovely?”
And as I stopped to observe that this was correct
To the proprietor, I couldn’t help but inspect
The folding table by the railing laden with her goods:
Ashtrays made of metal; little angels made of wood;
Hand mirror with the handle broken (still pretty nice);
Wall-wart to charge a telephone; trays to make ice
The advice of my neighbor, “Go ahead, take your time
We’ll negotiate price on whatever you find.”
And then shining in the detritus, I saw the brightest
Flash of something precious. I began to feel the slightest
Little tingle in my innards. I was like, “What’s that?”
Then her bare-tooth chuckle, “It’s a buckle for a strap
On a hat, like a lady wears to court or church
But it holds a special property. I’ll tell you how it works.”

It was a stoop sale
Which is a garage sale if you live in Brooklyn
Which I do
And at the stoop sale
Which is like a yard sale except that it’s in Brooklyn
I got my due

Somehow I knew she was serious. I reached to pick it up
But she stayed my hand. Her reprimand, it was abrupt
“This little trinket,” she said, “grants wishes
It can make everything you ever eat delicious
It can take away concern so you can sleep at night
Can make the love of your life and you reunite
Can right wrongs done in your past or in your future
Make a winner out of whoever whoever owns it roots for
But it only ever does one thing
As you take possession of it, that’s the wish to which it clings
So choose very carefully before we make a deal
If there’s anything impossible you want to make real
If there’s anything improbable you’d like to assure
It will happen. And that’s when you have to endure
The regret that accompanies said decision-making:
All the other wishes in the world that you’ve forsaken.”


Could it be true? I wondered as I stared at the clasp
Would some skills on the microphone be too much to ask?
Had a couple dark notions that involved revenge
Fame, glory, money, people love me and it never ends
Shook these from my head like they were so much sleep
And thought instead I’d pretend that I was so much deep
As to offer every human in the world true peace
So that we never kill each other, never get cooties
Never go hungry, suffer shelterlessness
This generosity I felt compelled to dismiss
By my greed to see an old friend back living
If I go the wrong direction, though, could I ever be forgiven?
While I stood daydreaming, somebody’d got a hold
Of this little brass buckle, and he must have been so bold
As to put it in his pocket without it getting bought
Saw him do it. He was wishing that he wouldn’t get caught",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-stoop-sale-lyrics
Braggadocio,Nerdcore Rising,2005.0,"Listen, I'll tell you that Frontalot is incredible
Even recommended to rock the mic like instead of a
Silence, you'd have me fronting into the amplifier
Point with the thumb, at which MC to admire
I got hi-res images of drum sounds that I loop
You get to listen to them and to me too
How fortunate y'all are to get to bask under my glow
The MC, humble conduit to nerdcore flow

Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
(And the trophy for Most Awesomest Rapper... Ever, goes to...
Sorry, I'm having some trouble with the envelope...
Holy shit— it's MC Frontalot!)

I stand 77 feet tall, I got eight balls
And all o' y'all are subject to my thrall
I act appalled when in receipt of less than the highest honor
Some day I'll be both revered and passé like Madonna
I'm all in effect, people tend to genuflect
When I enter rooms, cause all dopeness is subsumed
I spell the doom of the hip-hop subgenre you used to prefer
This geekish rhythm intersection
With the predilections that I've incurred
You say ""Word?""
With a surfeit of beats I'm unlikely to run out
Plus I'm so bright it's like redundant to have the sun out
And one out of each ten brags is hyperbolic
It's all inconsequential, cause you're just here to hear my tongue frolic

Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio

Pistachios ain't that great, I thought I'd mention 'em
Distinctive from how awesome I am, my rhyme is venturesome
Then, the dumb luck of it all, I discover
Other rappers already braggin'
But Front's on sync, no laggin'!
Keep slang in files that recombinate to add weight to fat tracks
I overlaid this very vocal via gums that flap
I sap clock cycles from the sucker MCs as they struggle to parse
And yet the Front's no farce!
Some awesome massive aspiration stationed itself in my head:
To be the dopest innovation since the slicing of bread
Instead of simply relying on my insistence to prove
That every twist of my tongue is another radical move
(Which it is, obviously.)

Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms like Ralph Macchio
Now it's time for a little braggadocio
While I swing my arms— (while I swing 'em)",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-braggadocio-lyrics
Shame of the Otaku,Final Boss,2008,"I put self loathing at the end of a string
Drag it after me, swing it like it wasn’t a thing
And I can sing in Japanese; please, don’t say to prove it
Maybe I forgot it when the music got interluded
Who did? Front, tell a lie? Did he mumble?
Did his sky-high credibility crumble?
Double humble was he then, and polite in speech?
Did he make escape? Has he escalated out of reach?
Or is he bringing each and every one of you a message?
Did he suggest that if you’re depressive it could presage
Not loving getting termed otaku?
But I don’t understand shame. I’ll leave it to you

Doom on the computron: this is back when
I could attack them for being intact men
While Frontalot was in a boyhood way
Without the talent, yo, to fake it, like I got today
I made play for the ladies. Where? In my head
If I could get them in my room I’d make them watch the Evil Dead II
From my bed, then over the heels how they’d tumble

Out-of-basement journeys upon which you don’t embark
Stark contrast to this spot: nerds are “hot.”
I’ve been observing in the media, they mention it a lot
They can rot with the popular kids they paraded

Invented yet. That isn't on the level but I'll try to pique your interest
With half-truths and lies
As ever, MC Frontalot feigns innocence and denies
I won't admit it. You can't make me say it:
That I dropped Calc B more than a year before Mosaic
Oh no now it's out, now it's shouted from the balconies:
That Frontalot's about to be engaging in some alchemy
I'll turn a string of operands into some smut
If that sort of thing's offensive to you keep eyes shut
Or better yet, don't even enter, into calculator, song
But if you're ready to be titillated, follow along
Ready? Go. Eighty women went to the podiatrist
Arrive: simultaneous. Soon the scene's riotous
Nine just leave. Those in the difference persevere
Packing up the lobby very tightly, domineered
By one Sally Gorey (that's her given name)
(though her title is Reception) (and professional acclaim
Is due her) ('cause she did what needed doing). And it's done:
She opened up the schedule, slotted every single one
But, um... not many on a Friday afternoon!
All but an eighteenth of the women in the room
Had to vrooooom. For each remaining patient
X-rays were taken. Then the doctor took vacation
Why was that vacation germane to the math?
'Cause of good data policy in the office and a vast
Abundance of caution on the part of our Sally:
Eight backups nightly, automated, and the tally
Only ever shrinking when manually deleted
All of this occurring in the box behind reception so she needed
A full backup of that box, noons
These weren't incremental, so her server needs ballooned
Who deserved to flee Duluth? The doctor was in Rio
For three work weeks and another Monday just to be so
Thoroughly relaxed upon return
Have you gathered all the facts that you needed to discern?
Morning in the office, after vacatings:
Out of those belonging to the original 80 ladies
How many digital toes were in images grand total?
Your evidence so far is largely anecdotal
And you're keen to know if any had deformity. So icky!
Ten toes per customer; this puzzle: not that tricky
Key in your calc. Check your seven-segment indicator
Now add my eliteness. Notice that the sum is greater
Than expected. You still have to subtract
Two for a pair of things Sally has that I lack
I warned you it was kind of immature; I wasn't skirting the issue
Still you snicker at the calculator. ""Dirty! I need a tissue.""",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-80085-lyrics

Every encounter that’s obstructionary comes in my name
So that you came to become obsessed with my location
Clues to my identity denied to the impatient
Step up -- I sense you’re on the precipice of something.
Me, I’m on the brink of delivering your lumpings:
Make you load your save up for the fifty fifth time,
Make you scroll through unskippable dialog lines
And you still ain’t any closer to discoverin why
Got technology for lackeys that can hover and fly
Got them other two guys in their sights and apt to wreck them

Got a bigger batch coming, statisticians
Got a dim opinion
Of your chance to survive

I got a hundred billion of em and they’re standing in line
To make you shine light out of your special move hole
Cause you got hit so hard by the energy bolt
And it’s a moat you can’t cross, a key you can’t get

Gotta collect bullshit that I done littered in the realm
Aim the whole game at you to fatigue and overwhelm


Final boss is the be-all end-all class of society
Very exclusive, but not higher than me
All the sobriety
Of the day and age might prove indecent
Cause me to find and strangle the baby of Jackie Gleason
But then I’m evil and puissant
Unpleasant and bent on my ends
At the final reckoning
Too late to make amends
It’s too late to make friends
I’m infuriated already
Primest cut of minion
Double-corrugated and steady
Stands between Fe and Fi, so go whistle
Go huddle a hobo corpse, nestle his bristle
This towers as your obstacle - my will will never bend
Doesn’t matter how you struggle, never gets you past the end

(no matter how preoccupied your nascent intellect)
To keep in mind doors! And close them behind you
Any time you leave one ajar, she might find you
I describe: human girl with wealth for hair
Ghosts for eyes, who wanders woods. Bears, beware
Through any doorway no closure obstructs
She wanders out of hunger. If she sees you, eats you up
Bear cub tallow scone with a honeydew butterwhip;
Consommé from your bones and your cartilage;
Fennel-mint sausages ground from your lungs;
Hollandaise all atop your remains by the time that she’s done
It’s why we leave porridge sitting
Case she makes it through an entryway, cold jaws dripping
Her saliva unremitting and her soul corrupt
(She could eat that instead of you, little cub.)
Gold Locks
Gets in through your open door
Stalks across the parlor floor
Creeping on her brunch
Let’s hope
She has had her fill
Won’t be lingering here still
Seeking out her brunch

Amber alert: call the fairy tale ambulance
‘cause this banana-colored-haired girl’s bananas, stabbing bears
Beware of the bear hugs. I'll kill you with my bare hands
When you’re barely sleeping, tear your lungs and leave you barren chest
Don't believe the tales they told you where the humans win?
I'll take your humerus and feed it to my human friends
Eyes luminous, voice is very soothing, yes
I’ll break and enter with entitlement that few possess
I’ll go crying through the forest and the woods
To the farmers in the village with an armful of goods
And by an armful of goods, I mean meat
And I mean your little bear cub arms and your feet
So better promise to your mama: leave the door locked
‘Cause you don't want to be at the base of a farmer’s tall pot
Don't mean to scare you, I really need to warn you:
Watch out for the frock ‘cause Goldilocks is coming for you

Calm, calm, little bear. Settle down deep in your blanketing
Yes, she’s lurking, but best remain sanguine
She’s not angry at you, just hungry
People don’t have feelings like bears, honey
They’re supernatural creatures that eat without cease
And they keep bound books full of us recipes
And this one freezes our hearts on return to the lair
What if she’s gotten in and she’s still there?
Don’t clutch the blanket, she visits when we’re absent
That and your absentmindedness acts as an attractant
One moment’s diligence is all it takes to defend
Your mother and me and yourself from an unwelcome end
All of her human friends, they could bring mimosa
Goldie gets her knives in you, might invite them all over

Livin’ At The Corner Of Dude & Catastrophe,Secrets from the Future,2007.0,"Where I’m livin’, it’s hard to say
Wasting my time at the corner of dude and catastrophe
Where I’m livin’, it’s hard to say
But I feel fine at the corner of dude and catastrophe
Woke up by the pool again
Must have played the fool again
Wonder what them hooligans put on the grill that stinks
Kind of like burnt fur and regurg’ed drinks
With an undertone of the acorn
And leather that’s laid on
Thick like Liz Claiborne
Step over with big trepidation
Lift up the top off the meat cooking station
To discover my homie Todd!
I said “Oh my God
What grim façade
Do you meet me with in my wakefulness?”
I had too many Stellas and they all was crisp;
Must I rise up in the morning with my squirrel desisted
From the world? Insisted, as I did
This instant, that
Him up in heaven again is premature?
If only reality would concur!
Poke him with the tongs. Dude won’t wake up
Put him on the lawn; 
Ray’s about to cook a steak up
And this ain’t no kind of mausoleum
Got to get the high degree on
Todd’s onomatopoeia
Got already all used up — I mean he sizzled —
Ain’t nothing left but char, bone, and gristle
My heart is fissile: I mean it could break
Like crystal; he never learned to whistle. Don’t wake
His cadaver up, wassamadda with your mind?
He ain’t a lawn clipping. We been knuckleheads since old times
Dig out the batting helmet and the bat
‘cause we’re all about to have a funeral, and that’s that
We’ll do it after breakfast. We’ll do it up proper
We’ll drop all his ashes out the Airwolf copter
All singing up dirges, all spreading out blossoms
And it’s gonna b-b-b-be frikkin’ awesome!
Where I’m livin’, it’s hard to say
Wasting my time at the corner of dude and catastrophe
Where I’m livin’, it’s hard to say
But I feel fine at the corner of dude and catastrophe
Six bong rips later: we ain’t going to the helipad
Standin’ ‘round hella sad
Wonder where them Stellas at
All these dudes ain’t huge on sentiment
Still they want to say a little something to the benefit
Of layin’ Todd’s soul to rest
I cold regressed, contemplated old regrets
And said, “Man why he even got to do a thing
Like pass out on the Bar-B-King?”
I’m tryin’ to bring from like recesses in my mind
A word or two that wouldn’t prove unkind
Aligned as he was with the less-than-angelic
Trafficking black tar smack & psychedelics
In that little-ass van of his, and drunk doing it
Knowing what the right thing to do was but eschewing it
It’d seem pretty probable
Flames are audible:
That’s the duty that Todd’ll pull
Not just in death, but in after-that
Like the bat out the h-e-double-vertical-slat
But inbound in the case of this rodent
Like when he got peeled-out on and ‘sploded
Or in fact when he got shanked in the joint —
Hella causing me to wonder if there’s even a point
To our shepherdly tending of his life’s ending
Bet he’s chilling at Friendly’s
And gonna be back in the neighborhood shortly
Discussing how awesome it is to be portly
Reporting the slant he just got on with Blister
(drank till his wrists hurt
Boned the ghost of your sister)
The dude’s a bucket kickster when he has to be
And this one wasn’t like a masterpiece
So yes we’re depressed but not drastically...
Livin’ at the corner of dude and catastrophe
Where I’m livin’, it’s hard to say
Wasting my time at the corner of dude and catastrophe
Where I’m livin’, it’s hard to say
But I feel fine at the corner of dude and catastrophe
I’ll just wait, waving goodbye until the next time

Canadia,Final Boss,2008,"Listen up! I’m an American
And I know just what to be scared of
When I hear the word “foreign” I go
Immediately down to the GroceryCo
For my anti-terrorism do-it-yourself
Home kit that they got there up on the shelf
With my stubbornly health, I can’t get exploded;
Haven’t got wealth enough to devote it
In such large measure to picking up bits
So I’d better be prepared on the terrorist tip!
And I do that there in the simplest way:
By carefully considering Canad-i-a
And deeming its shiftiness quotient high
(got a notion why and it’s ocean sized)
And I’m mostly fine with you people, but watch it
Canadia strikes me as unpatriotic

Let me get this straight:
Provinces, not states?
Who’s your president? (nawww)
See, that’s what I meant!
Post the border guard!
Prepare to bombard!
Countrymen, I say to ya:
Beware Canadia!

How’d we ever get so misconstrued?
I thought I heard ‘em all, but this one’s rude
Listen, dude, don’t ask for favours
Then speak ill of your next door neighbour
From West Coast ravers to Northeast seal hunt, I’m shocked
How am I supposed to feel, Frontalot?
Jeez, keep your guns and Glocks under locks and keys, please!
I’m stopped and freezed, cops are easily bought for cheap
I know not to sleep when I walk the streets of
New York or Los Angeles, crime riddled cities:
A fine kettle of fish where you’ll find little pity
Every piddly bit of validity in me
Exhibits lividity: you’re an idiot indeed!
Consider me out; your beef doesn’t concern me
I’m cutting dead weight like a weekend at Bernie’s


Yo, Jesse, I think that dude Front’s onto us
Time to let those neutron bombs erupt
Then release Snake Men in the AM
To make people watch reruns of Amen
“Say again?” No
Halifax-Jupiter-Mexico:
We gotcha cornered like the edge of a room
We got alien heads in a tomb
“Huh?” Catch my drift like slipstream;
It’s better on the top like whipped cream
Y’all can have Pamela Lee
R&D already cloned her family tree
We got implants for your medulla lobes
All we want to do is rule the globe
But for now, we’ll let you make believe
That we don’t put microchips in maple leaves

You put in the effort to pick up our language
Though I do notice occasional manglage
Of pronunciation. The letters O U
Come out your mouth oooo. Don’t know why but they do
Plus somebody told me y’all are rich
Got foliage, rock oil in pitch
But if you don’t have our freedom, you hate it
Gonna put you on the list to get liberated
C’mon!


Yo Front man, come visit!
We'll go to Tim Hortons, and uh
Check out some beavers
We got... balloons
And blue money
Snow pants
And soup",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-canadia-lyrics
Critical Hit,Solved,2011.0,"Got to sometimes feel like, oh my god, life's so good

I'm on the cover of a lot — a lot! — of magazines
Note I don't say all. But I've been practicing
My big TV grin and charming banter
Interviewers, always follow-upping on the answers
Prancers such as I lift heels up
Get your people here, we'll set some deals up
But don't fuss my pretty little with the chores
I'm critically acclaimed and I'm never ignored
Now, notice that none of that's true
Frontalot got inauthentic at you? What else is new?
What else to do but keep on seeming
Like a celebration lyric could be anything redeeming?


I write the songs you can't get out of your head
And my artistic accomplishments are often said
To soften dread in the hearts of the reviewers:
""another tour de force from the performer who inures
All listeners to the ravages of cynicism
With the pure and simple freshness of his syllogism.""
Listen, isn't this the case: critical darlings
Always are unbeloved of the masses; in the parlance
Of the populace, they suck. And since I'm awful
Just an air gust that holds aloft the copter of the ROFL
It's obvious why I'm such a critic's to-do
But when Frontalot discusses it, is anything true?


And I quote, ""His interrogation of failing to keep it real
Disassembles the meaning inherent and then reveals
Artifice itself to be integral to veracity.""
...part of a 5-star notice posted about the last CD
I'm at capacity, I overflow with fronting
(That was a good point once, but I fear it suffers blunting.)
Let me simply tell you something: the living is good
Up on the top of the top-ten lists where I just stood
In my fist, where the disc should be brandished like a trophy
Instead I'm holding onto the prize possession: self-loathing
And you know life's sweet if you can sing about that
Like I rolled nat 20, double damage on the track",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-critical-hit-lyrics
Wakjakaga,Question Bedtime,2014,"Yo, if your parents hear you listening to this, they’re going to frown
They’ll be like, “our babysitter Frontalot’s letting us down.”
In fact, I bet it’s around now that their ears perk up
Already poised to disengage the circuit
Wakjąkága was not exactly a man
More like the demiurge than a demigod, if you understand
And if you don’t, let me just say he’s a bit of a fool:
Sort of a jester, but also a simpleton too
He wandered the forest in search of some food
A couple duck carcasses (of which he approved)
Dripping with fat, sizzle in his campfire
Wakjąkága gets bored of cooking, gets tired
Gets comfy, warming his back at the hearth
Though it’s pretty early, he’s not the only creature on the earth
There’s foxes. They’d like a duck dinner too
Brown Eye Detective Agency got interviewed
Keep an eye out!
Wakjąkága‘s booty-butt
Should’ve paid attention
There were no other applicants. The booty’s on lookout
Can only Po at interlopers, hard to guard the cook-out
Wakjąkága woke up and he stretched
Reached for his dinner: nothing but bones left
His booty was stone deaf to recrimination and censure
One duty, shirked, leaving trust in contention
And Wakjąkága, so stern with his underling
Stabbed it where you or I would wear underthings
With a sharp stick that happened to be on fire
As proper punishment for its failing to keep its eye out
Satisfied with this discipline, he went about his way
Still with his tummy grumbling and dismayed
Hope before it’s too late, he could find a tidbit
What should he happen upon but an unattended
Sizzling strip of the fat that he’d savored before?
He gobbled it and ambled along, imagining more
O cornucopia! The world’s older brother here
Keeps on discovering, discarded everywhere
Just what he’s looking for: the most delicious
Fresh-cooked dishes. Seems a bit suspicious...
Someone just littering hot meat? Yo, hold up
You’re walking in a circle, Wakjąkága!
Ought to check your backside where the gaping wound you made is
Uh oh. Young ones, be careful how you say this:
His anus was trailing out guts in abundance and
Upon himself is how he’d meted punishment
Upon himself: also how he’d been dining.
 So
Took a couple handfuls of his booty up and tied it closed
And that’s why part of your butt’s wrinkly
Wakjąkága couldn’t help mingling:
Shaping the world while he faked his way through it
Till we’re just like him, half divine, half stupid",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-wakjakaga-lyrics
Captains Of Industry,Solved,2011.0,"My man Lars has got the talent and he flaunts it
And he drops fat hits every one-hundredth concept
The onset of his rapping is blunt
It beats you up in the manner that he’d call post-punk
You know the fans can’t get enough, always holler for more
I think they’re even louder than they were before
The previous encore
Just hope they let him offstage soon;
Vital business in the back where the hoodies are strewn
Come up

My boy Front is always managing his vocal takes
Playing up his nerd persona, every day he integrates
You want to hear a rap about a game from ‘82?
Good news! MC Frontalot’s got songs for you
Full of rhymes that he drops, pretty hot, make ‘em rock
With  the style he concocts: nerdcore hip-hop
Flash light on his head
, 
‘cause homeboy went and started it
Grabbing your allowances, he knows how to market it

My boy Front is in the tee shirt business
My man Lars is in the tee shirt business
Look at us, we’re in the tee shirt business
I thought we were musicians — what is this?
Frontalot is in the tee shirt business
M.C. Lars is in the tee shirt business
Both of us are in the tee shirt business

You try to sell music, they look at you funny
Not a transaction that necessitates money
Not with the true cunning of the kids in the know
But you look at them cheering — notice what? 
They don’t sew
Don’t go to the print shop and silkscreen their own
Yet they’re always needing something to cover the torso
That’s why MC Lars and I provide a product
Sit atop high fashion. Inventory! You got it

Costume glasses
, mouse pads, 
robot USBs
Captains are we. Of what? Industry!
Rockefeller, Adam Smith, rock a cellar just like this
Rock a crowd of rowdy kids. So, Frontalot, tell me this:
Is it 
all about the Washingtons
 or all about the art?
Indie rap, we’re into that, following our hearts
But part of the job — I mean the other part from caring —
Is taking tee shirt money like we’re modern 
robber barons

MC Lars is in the tee shirt business
MC Front is in the tee shirt business
Look at us we're in the tee shirt business

Frontalot is in the tee shirt business

Both of us are in the tee shirt business
I thought we were musicians — what is this?


Oh we know every fabric weight, every drop-ship price
Every line-screen density. Designs are precise

Cotton woven so nice, blind eyes to child labor:
You as the consumer are the lucky money saver

And we savor all your savvy, as it leads you to our wares
Up in the gilded age of geekery, we so sneakily prepared
This foolproof method of making just the shirts you want
With my top hat and my monocle and your money, I abscond

Horris Records harvesting the forest near your home
For the paper in the 
liner notes
 of every disc you own
You should have known that our sweatshirts were pure baby seal
Go ahead and treat yourself. You love the way it feels

The appeals of the audience:

Get back on stage! Where you at?

By the merch booth, trying to get paid!
Got a hundred people covered

Though their arms stay bare

The only way

We get to do it:

Check the logos they wear

Mornings Come And Go,Question Bedtime,2014.0,"He came looking for work from an ogre
Why would you do that? It’s tough all over
The monster seemed nice at first, offered one duty per day
The worst he could say
About his boss was it promised to eat him
If he didn’t finish shoveling the stable. Exceedingly
Easy, isn’t it? The boy agrees
Kicks his heels when the ogre leaves
Now the Master Maid had a job there too
There were always boys. They were always new
They were always eaten at the end of the day
On account of the curse on the goat dookie
She tells this one about the magic pitchfork:
Best advice that a boy could wish for
Rest of the afternoon, they discuss it
A day’s acquaintance, already trusted
Confidantes in the house of dangers
Ogre’s home! It roars and rages
“Live the night, but don’t bless your fortune;
I’ll have another task in the morning for you.”

The Master Maid says you take it real slow
The Master Maid says mornings come and mornings go
The Master Maid says you take it real slow
The Master Maid says mornings come and go

He wakes to the dawning
Before he can yawn, there’s an ogre on him
Telling him to round up a flaming horse
Ogre’s sure got demanding chores
Heed the counsel of the Master Maid:
Use the hidden bridle, get the stallion tamed
And every morning this is how it’s played
She instructs, he survives a day:
How to take the sand and spin it
Into rope, and what the limit
Is collecting fire taxes
From the underworld. What the ogre asks is
“did you get the data from the girl in the house?”
Boy insists he didn’t. “How’d
You get up the seven-mile tree for my eggs then?
Guess I don’t need her. Guess I’ll eat her. Guess when.”
That night, she sneaks in his quarters
He says he loves her, she says he oughta
Gotta flee! She counsels patience
“the night is slow but the morning hastens...”


Count dusk to dawn. In a rush, they’re gone
But what locks held them thus so long?
Not any, ‘cept for certain pursuit
Plenty of the lady’s girlish virtues
Get expended. Hair comb, flung
Whence it landed, briar sprung
And though it’s stung, beast presses onward
Her mirror, thrown, wreaks the contours
Of an icy mountain range which
Shatters fast. Behold, the Master Maid dips
Vast ocean from a perfume flask
Ogre drinks it, bursts in half!
At the shore, the boy must venture homeward
Tells his cohort, “wait here, no more
Tears. I’ll return to claim you
Once my life’s prepared. And hey, do
You believe in love?” This maiden
Waited every day in the calendar, patiently
Knew the boy would find her
Come some morning, wear those blinders


The Master Maid said

The Master Maid said
The Master Maid said mornings come and go

Devil In The Attic,Question Bedtime,2014,"It’s the bad old days, when young ladies are possessions
And they haven’t any agency, decision nor discretion
And we’ve got the choicest one right here: our famous daughter
A jewel that mustn’t fall to any robber or marauder
She’s the gilding on our fortune. But a portion of her beauty
Would be plenty to entice the finest, thus we’re snooty
Got my “who do you think is good enough for my little girl” on
‘cause you know the whole world’s wide, the whole world’s long
And in the expanse of it, she might be the most valuable
We keep her in the house until she’s wed. She might be malleable
She might take up with interests. There’d be no marrying her then
To the very, very handsomest of men
Listen, it’s a burden being wealthy but the rumors I collect
Indicate there is a suitor who could be without defect
So beautiful of feature that he matches the bride
Now he’s courting in the evenings, I hope stars could align (collide)...
Anything you could have, we have it
Even got a devil in the attic
Now these are the grand old evenings for a couple of reasons
The beautifullest boy has got my daughter feeling feelings
(through a fence, and there’s chaperones, don’t think us dullards)
In protection of our asset, we keep her visage covered
And his family’s intent to do the same. They stay in shadow
But tonight’s the night it happens! Please don’t think us shallow;
We’re excited to inspect him, all we’ve heard, he’s such a prize
They’ll be wedded in our parlor once she looks into his eyes

Not an invited guest, more like a secretive squatter
I’m here to appear, disappear, create fear inside your daughter
She's mine. I got dibs. Had them ever since the crib
I laugh at your decision to fib when she's not even yours to give
I'm a ghost, a spirit, a deity. My reality is your realty
I can cause quite a commotion if your notion isn’t fealty
So send me up a BLT, and if you’re thorough, a Sapporo
I'll forget you let her think she was ever something to be borrowed
This union's got me fuming, cause a racket in the attic
I'll malign your mansion, make it collapse and cause a panic
I can be satanic. I suggest you profess your allegiance
Or expect an attic avalanche of malevolent malfeasance
I asked the groom to choose his doom: “Your life or your face.”
Anyone would pick the latter. You pick the former, you can’t replace
The vain would rather die but the groom chose his life
But will his wife like his type now that his face was a fright? Not quite!

Oh, fate! This is a tragedy of a face, son
But we’re sadder for our daughter, who’s got this abomination
For a husband. He’s all busted up and ruined. Wish we’d seen him in his glory
Wish this could’ve been a happy story
As the high class people our whole family used to be
I must apologize for hosting the mostly demon-free
(except for the one exception) ruined evening of the wedding
The other father fled it early, please convey to him my deep regretting

Actually, I’ve been here the whole time. I was just admiring these sliding screen doors. These are nice, how do you slam these?",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-devil-in-the-attic-lyrics

Two Dreamers,Question Bedtime,2014.0,"I live in Baghdad. I had a million dollars
After that last bad investment, I live in squalor
Still got a grandiose house, but it’s run down
Jackals take possession of it promptly at sundown
On account of the holes in the walls. So, I sleep in the yard
Huddled by the fountain, ground is keeping it hard
I’d be deeply alarmed if I weren’t so depressed
Keep an eye on the stars, I guess. Get some rest
As I drift off, feel like I hear a voice whispering
“Despair in due time, take comfort in the interim.”
I’m listening. “Step to the west in the early air
Your fortune is in Cairo. Regain it if you journey there.”
Oh no, I don’t know if I could trust a dream
Has one ever been what it seems?
Oh no, I don’t know if I could trust a dream
What it keeps on promising
Cairo is quite a ways away
I’m hitch-hiking on carts, got my vulnerable parts displayed:
My neck, my hope, and my desperation
By the time I get to Damascus, half sick with exasperation
At my own propensity for delusion
Some dreams are visions, but only illusions
And with my sandal worn to nothing, wander past a pyramid
This is Cairo, isn’t it? Wonder where my treasure’s hid?
It isn’t in front of me. Well, okay. I take a seat
Get arrested immediately for vagrancy
This my reward for venturing abroad:
Chuck me in the clink, lash me to sleep with a palm rod
Three days later, dragged before the magistrate
Thirty-fifth most important dude in the caliphate
Asks me why I came so far if I’ve got nothing
To my name but my gumption. I explain how I’ve got crushing
Doubts, about my faith in a voice that had come in the night
He laughs in my face, his hind teeth are bright white
Says he had that dream — of Baghdad — thrice
And the voice in it, offering specific advice:
“Seek a high style manor where a jackal is lord
Dig up a fortune in the courtyard.” This he ignored
As he assured me any wise man would. Guess I’m silly, then
Back to Baghdad, unearth my new millions",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-two-dreamers-lyrics
Start Over,Question Bedtime,2014.0,"Little Red Riding Hood was in good
With the food distribution, by her own volition
Choosing to sincerely deliver
To old folks: succor; also vigor;
Cheese and crackers; salt and coffee;
Medicine to help the heart beat softly
Awfully kind in her mission
Red was (yes) in a head-on collision
With the forces of trouble
Long in the tooth plus stubble. And this goes double
For all little girls: know who wolves are
Don’t be telling them where you’re going, how far
In what direction it is, especially if
It’s the unguarded cottage where Grandma lives
This is just common sense
(with which Little Red dispensed)
Hence, she proceeded on her way
Through the woods to Grandma’s place
Little Red Riding hood rolled up
Took one look and was like what the... uh
What the heck? Grandma got a hairy neck?
Teeth enough to get wrecked?
Next up: wood axe swinging
That’s how it happened. That’s all I’m singing
That’s the story (that ain’t how it happened...)
I won’t start over if you don’t stop yapping
(shhhh)
Wolves got it hard on this earth
Ever the subjects of defamation and mirth
First in line to be out there, lurking
Eyeing ingénues and smirking
Working on a master plan
Trying to get fed about the best he can
Wondering if Grandma got much meat
Endeavoring not to be indiscreet:
“How many them baskets she go through a month?
How does she react when she misses lunch?
And what direction was she living in, again?
Well, you better hurry up and go and visit her then.”
But wolves are speedier than little girls
Barely pausing to devour jackrabbits and squirrels
The wolf arrived
All the rest, despicable lies
All that talk of assumed identity
Let it be. This wolf was indelibly
Wolf-like, forthright too
He said, “Grandma, here’s what I’ll do:
Swallow you whole, your kinfolk for after
Then I’ll keep living, so you don’t have to
Sorry, starving wolf, no choice
To get in the gullet, just follow my voice.”
(That ain’t how it happened...)
All right, Grandma was hanging alone
Cultivating the medicine for the glaucoma
She paid rent in the forest. It was inexpensive
Grandma’s house was in the intensively
Wolf-rife section of town
She didn’t mind, she liked a wild hound
Sound at the door: an intruder!
“Is that you, Red? You brought food for
Me to eat?” “Nope, the opposite
No hard candy, no soft chocolate
Just a wolf belly for you to inhabit
And I will need your nightshirt for the next gambit.”
Clandestinely reclining in bed
The wolf awaits (for Red!)
Expecting their usual banter:
“How’s school?” “Fine, Grandma
Here’s food.” “Thanks dear.”
Instead it’s all, “What’s up with the ears?
Eyes? Nose? Throat? Teeth?”
“Little Red Riding Hood, why you giving me grief?
Bodies change as the years advance
Soft features grow unkind to the glance
And hairs sprout
All of it the better for you getting in my mouth!”
“Wow, it’s dark in here,” says Grandma
Here comes the wood axe, swinging like “Yeah, y’all!”
Old woman, come on back out
And you keep the axe. Wolves abound

Tongue-Clucking Grammarian,Final Boss,2008,"Intro:
Young people today could probably benefit from my 12 years in college so here's some advice: If you're a young person who writes poetry, throw it away right now
Hook:
Tut, tut, tongue-clucking grammarian, yo
Tut, tut, check your punctuation
Tut, tut, tongue-clucking grammarian, yo
Tut, tut
Tut, tut
Verse 1:
Anybody, wonder what you’re up against?
You get clucked at. Dense: your best defense
You jest. Relent! You’re too bright not to do it
I go “foopth” on that, an onomato-poo-ic
And while I’m on the topic of Frontalot’s tongue
I should mention that it’s knotted but it comes undone
And as it unravels, the cluck emits
The discipline in your ear, stuck in your head like a hit (goes,)
Bridge (x4):
Tut, Tut!
Tut, Tut!
Verse 2:
Listening to hit records led to your sad state
You ought to take talk seriously. Put it to pate
And it’ll seep in. That’s my supposition
And I suppose, in subjunction, if it did, I’d listen
To what you said next for once

Much Chubbier,Question Bedtime,2014.0,"Yo, billy goats like myself favor hillsides
We’re so good at going up them, it instills pride
And it feels right, posing on a peak
From up here, see into the end of next week
So I speak from observation, brothers: way over yon
There’s an incline that I like to picture us on
Got the greenest of the grasses that I ever beheld
With a breeze in our direction, I could tell by the smell
That we’ve never been fed how this hilltop could feed us
My bigger brothers, I dream of all three of us
Wandering yonder and filling our bellies up
But! Without us becoming deli cuts
In the process. This is the rub
Got a stream in between going glubbidy-glub
The only bridge over, infested by troll
Hunger in my belly’s got me ready, set, go!
​ (x2)
Look at me, I could be much chubbier
If I could eat, you would see much chubbier me
And then I would be much chubbier
Look at me, I could be much chubbier
I’m so scrawny! Much chubbier
The goat behind me is chubbier
He’s much chubbier

Big buck big brother, you’re the tallest of all of us
You could skip the situation like a troll apologist
Non-confrontational, bypass the bridge
Ford the river, meet your brothers on the ridge (What a cinch)
But the kid and the buckling get it in that scenario
Two orders of cabrito by the scary moat
And I know biggest brother isn’t timid
Make short work: bridge troll, one minute
But check that bridge, it’s thin, it’s flimsy
That thing’s finished when you tussle, what a grim scene
Planks and ropes in the water, wave goodbye
And that’s two of us still going hungry tonight
So follow my lead, I got a notion to negotiate
""Yo, troll, ready up your dinner plate""
Not for me, though. I’m much too slight
Look and see! I’m the littlest, could barely fill a bite
 (x2)

He thinks I’m a plum fool, little does he know
He thinks he’s so smart, I think he’s a beanpole
Look at his chump chop, tiny and sinewy
His little hind legs, they remind me of centipedes
I wait for the real meat. That one’s a real geek
This little brainiac’s a waste of my appetite
And if he’s lying, well he’s got to come back tonight
I’ll play the bad karma coming back to bite
Here comes big bro, chubbier indeed
Succulent mutton putting my stomach in frenzy!
I’ve chewed enough wood. I’m hungry and won’t wait
An even chubbier brother, really? You don’t say!
If’n it’s untrue, I’m seeing you both ways
If he’s really chubbier, I’m feeding the whole day
I’m thinking of skirt steaks. My tummy starts rumbling
It feels like an earthquake... am I going berserk? Wait!
Ahhh!

Later, troll! Hey biggest brother, dry off, salad bar’s open

Got a message number 4 1 9
Got a message number 4, 1, 9
Got a message number 4 1 9
This lucky day's mine all mine

This isn’t intended for me, I don’t think
It’s a missive from the edge of despair, I mean brink
Of total desperation; the communication therein
Says her hopes for survival are slim
And she’s writing to the Front, though we’ve yet to meet
With a confidential matter ‘cause she’s heard I’m discreet
And the urgency of her request for my aid
Is matched by the depth of the trust she displayed
“Don’t betray me like our oil minister did (staged a coup)
And I’m about to flee Nigeria soon
But I’ll never make it out,” she says, with twenty million
Three hundred twenty thousand US dollars that are still in
Her possession. She embezzled them, I guess
Look, I don’t really know her so uh... that’s none of my business
She’s the LADY MARYAM ABACHA, deposed
These days, can’t even get her caps-lock key unfroze
But yo, something about a widow in distress
With 20 million dollars hidden in a metal chest
Softened up the Frontalot’s heart, no doubt
So I hit the reply button, tell her I can help her out

She acts so thankful. A bank full of money awaits!
And I hate delays so I’m quick to turn around
With my full name and the number to my checking account
And the scan of my license to drive an automobile
And my passport number, proving Frontalot’s for real!
Then I’ll meet the money in Stockholm. Ain’t gonna walk home
Think I’ll retire to the south of Spain and sip gazpacho
Not so quick, there’s a little problem:
LADY A apparently had difficulty running all them
Numbers I give her. But look, the fake ID’s my only one
And that’s a real passport — I got it off usenet and checked
I’m not dumb. I’m not some idiot
Who’s about to lose your money for you quicker than I’m getting it
And of course my bank balance is negative; whose isn’t?
That’s why I need your 20% money laundering commission
And I’m wishing I could talk about this further with you but I can’t

He’s got a hundred and seventy-seven million in a bag

"You’ve got aspergers, kid!",UnKnown,UnKnown,"You got Asperger's, this ain't a barbecue
It's your whole afternoon though, lost down a rabbit hole
Looking for a timepiece, wonder when your date's at
Wonder if she'll visit you at all today — relax
Wonder how many ribbons to expect in her hair —
To deflect talk of triplets in respect for the pair
Or to stare at the bow made of four different colors —
Didn't notice someone talking to you: there were others
In the room, out in the gloom of the periphery
To shift your focus for a moment is to give the ribbons liberty
And that's to suggest they make escape
This is a secret from the future: can't rewind like a tape
Got to make the best and the most of each moment as it happens
Got to keep your eyes on those bows, got to trap in
Your vision all four of them cause this is a first:
She might have noticed last time that you like ribbons that are hers
And sometimes you wish you didn't. Sometimes it slips your mind
But when she's supposed to visit isn't one of those times
And you're on one of those lines of thought that you encounter
When you'd rather your surroundings were quieter instead of louder
So that you could focus on other than a clock tick
You don't want to talk shit but the one who made the clock made the cog stick
Minutes are violent noise
Obliterating what you thought of as silent poise
Miles of boys before you done got crushed
Out on a girl like that, her hair flush
With ribbons on all occasions and every day
If only making study of the bow could stem its getaway
Letter A S P E R G E R S:
Wonder whether she's so confident with alphabets
That she'd do it backwards skipping alternate letters
If you offer demonstration, would she consider that clever?
This bitter endeavor: trying to predict a reaction
You know you're supposed to try to give the notion traction
But it don't do nothing 'cept make the clock tick
It don't even do that. Yo, you got Asperger's, kid
And I feel for you, son. I know love is hard
Can't even write down all the answers on the back of a card
From the back and the far end of a cafeteria line
You seem to catch sight of a ribbon. Fabric shines
And you abandon your tray, leave it clatter on the floor
You haven't planned it this way. You can't look at her no more
You don't know what her eyes are like, whether she ever smiles
Whether anything other than how she wears her hair beguiles
And while some apron ladies holler at you
You clutch your left ear and stand still like a statue
You could count cut corn on the floor without subtracting
Misplaced fish sticks like Dustin Hoffman overacting
Ain't this already a scene in need of a fast forward?
Why won't the lunch people hush, do they court discord?
You think you see a flash of color fleeing; it could be worse:
You could have known how many ribbons there are, if they were hers",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-youve-got-aspergers-kid-lyrics
Shudders,Question Bedtime,2014.0,"I wasn't the smartest boy in the household by a longshot
I knew of wandering the graveyard that it's best met with an onslaught
Of something called shudders
It's when your body trembles and your heart skips, sputters
And you mutter counter-evils, and you grip on to your charms
I've never comprehended the alarm
Caused by things described variously as scary
Terrifying, ghastly. Could I follow this? Barely
Certainly never felt it. Never shuddered, and my pops
Sent me packing, called me bad luck kid, head full of rocks
I talked so loudly of my ignorance as I roamed
Complained I couldn't get frightened, and might have bemoaned
That I'd been disowned. A friendly hangman beckoned
But I partied with his danglers, didn't shudder for a second
Then I heard about a castle in the distance that was haunted
Nobody lasted there an evening. Could it be just what I wanted? Didn't know

Didn't know
There was anything
In the world
To be frightened of

There was anything

I wasn't the first one to show up claiming bravery
The rumored ends of my predecessors were unsavory
They'd become the catering at a feast of ghouls and spirits!
Neither the king nor his people would set foot near it
This seemed good; fear, it glistened in their eyes as they spoke
I figured I could pick the habit up and go
(maybe all the way back home, having understood shuddering)
Did the townspeople deem me a simpleton? Utterly
What a first night it was, too! The hell-beasts
Were like from a nightmare. I think? I don't get bad dreams
I tried to nap but the furniture floated and spun
We did some doughnuts in the stable yard! Fun
The second night's vigilance wasn't any more fruitful:
Zombies down the chimney till the whole rec. room's full
All-bone nine-pin, glad I brought my lathe
Though I lost some money gambling, my denseness was unscathed

Didn't know
There was anything
In the world
To be frightened of

There was anything
In the world
To be frightened of
Didn't know
There was anything

Third and final evening, my reanimated corpse
Cuddle-buddy tried to strangle me. Reliable sources
Report that I chucked him back in his coffin and sighed
Despaired of finding shudders locally and set to stride
Didn't I want my reward? The hand of the castle's princess?
A path to power and riches, and this is its ingress?
And this is my dimness, I guess, but I choose to keep questing:
Find the next hypothesis of scariness and keep testing
But here's that princess requesting that I reconsider
And as I spy her she reminds me of my babysitter
A village girl I had a crush on as a lad
Who never even noticed that I couldn't make eye contact
This one's staring me down
She's used to getting her way, been wearing a crown
Is she scaring me now, with her ""Think about it, please?""
I got this odd involuntary shaking in my knees

Dating Profile,"Net Split or, the Fathomless Heartbreak of Online Itself - EP",2018,"Before you look at me like I’m a neo-Luddite
All screens point at me at once in a real floodlight
Ideally sunlight would bathe me more often
Between now and a million internets and a coffin
Can’t soften up my viewpoint:
Modern love is the realm and computron is the true coin
And that’s it for you, boy. You’re forty-two and the coif fled
Better find true love immediately, as you’ve oft said
So you figure the thing out, pick out a password
Look in your digital photographs folder over the last third
Of your life. Is anything plausibly still hot?
What kind of hope about love have you impossibly still got
Lodged in your nerd mind?
Don’t you remember biology, all of the sad ones that the herd find
Difficult to cope with
Left the group and weren’t eloped with
Before you look at me

All that I have ever wanted

Your belief in top basics got stasis
You take ways that you might not be forgivable, reveal them
List your investment in every real un-
Shakable truth that you’ve ever pondered
That profile text seems far off. You never wander
You write what you’ve seen people write, like:
You feel extreme nostalgia for Excitebike;
You read this book once and you quite liked it;
Screens keep you company bright nights like these
There’s a reply! This thing is pinging at you
Look at his eyes: both of them singing at you
He’s in disguise as you, except beautiful
Offers his services. Whispers he’s dutiful
Wait, it’s the dating app. It made a map of your whole identity
But with all of the things that your soul intends to be
Punched up and expressed now unequivocally
Plus, it fixed your chin, and the whole thing’s riveting
It’s leveraging a neural network on your behalf
Check the projected effectiveness there on the graph
If you let go, it’ll send notes to other romance-seeking persons
Or rather to the prettier, funnier, geekier versions
Of those humans that the system surely improved
Your algorithm is better at flirting than you
Their algorithms are better at flirting back
Your virtual face, already out on a date with your top match
Each of your virtual fleshes intertwine
And even though you’re not participating, this is fine
It’s kind of ideal as your dating endgame:
Bot’s got your heart simulating on the mainframe
Keeps it beating in your name",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-dating-profile-lyrics

Maybe you’re going to live forever and ever

You don’t meet a lot of people in emergency rooms

She had the penicillin, no expiration when she mothered
Her no-good little death-proof brats
Living little ones once were preciouser than that
Living anybody used to be a miracle, yo
You’d get et by the festering hysterical flow
Of madnesses and bad diseases of mole
Lung, eye, and humor, spirit and soul
All these afflictions engender aversions:
I catch Green Sickness to match with the virgins;
Scrofula coughs that I cast askance;
Ever since Black Scurvy, I can’t wear pants
And I can’t but dance with glee that it’s not then now
“I bet you got the Tarantism.” – and how!

Maybe you’ll never die
Maybe you’re going to live forever
And never have anything wrong with you

Iliac Passion, Spelter's Chill
Weaver's Bottom, and a Melancholy Ache

I Can See,Question Bedtime,2014.0,"I may be the tailor to the master of the castle and the zone
And I might be all about it when I’m on my megaphone
Alone before an audience, ""Yo, ponder my preponderance
Of skill!” Synonymous
With high class fashion. If you must step flashing
Lead with the hand that you’ve got your cash in
I’m taking all orders. I’m writing receipts
There’s a couple other kingdoms I’ve got to visit this week
So I’ll seek you out later, deliver your set
If it ain’t the finest clothing ever woven, take my head
With a promise like that, shopping couldn’t be simpler!
Armed guards are taking me to measure up the Emperor
I can see
Right through them
Through them

Well, it’s clear that we hear these boasts in our ears
So it appears that this tailor in front of us right here
Speaks the language that I’m liking. And in fact
I need a new look now that Fall’s coming back
My style: people heard of it. In fact, it’s quite murderous!
And every kingdom tries their best in the hopes of furnishing
The Emperor that only rocks the finest couture
And I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen your brand name before

Your prominence, I promise that your dominance is undisputed:
When it comes to looking fresh, you’re as reputed!
I’m a whisper in your kingdoms, they don’t dare to buy the best
Might look so good that it’s scandalous

No coarse cotton stitchings, no silk that’s not the finest
No inferior fabric is allowed to touch Your Highness
When I say I want the best, present it without fail
Or this tailor’s going to have his going-out-of-business sale

Be sure before you order though, ‘cause this one’s fine
So delicate, you’ll never feel it. And so sublime
That it’s difficult to see for anyone above their birth
Sent an Archduke into exile on the other side the earth
I besmirch of course none of your councilors’ parentage
Still I shouldn’t forgive myself, giving embarrassment

Nah, this court bears the noblest noblemen
So loosen up your fingers and sew us a specimen

By the sword, you pulled wool from all of our sheep
And we were told we’d be getting fresh blankets to sleep
Instead, you covered your palace in silk and wool
And tore down our schools for a textile mill?

Subjects, peasants, servants and scum
This wunderkind tailor's skill’s second to none!
Painters and poets couldn’t ever describe
How fine the new clothes. On the morrow you’ll find!

How about debuting bread from the wheat that you stole?
Or put a new school in the village you burned?
Winter’s approaching we got nowhere to go
Can’t produce for the King when we’re starved in our homes

I can see
As soon as he steps out in his finery

Give us liberty or give us that robe, fool
Ain’t no linens in this kingdom that are torch-proof
And I only hope that what you’re about to show is made from bread
So at least the birds can have a feast when you’re dead
It’s been (bark! bark!) since you pushed us off the land
Hurry up and show your face so we can take what’s ours again

Good luck, buddy! He’ll be right out, he looks great

Hello

Bought three movie tickets, got the front row
Act I

Our plucky hero's home town:
Middle Americana, not a problem to be found
A single dad of one son with a dog just trying his
Best to make ends meet as a disaster scientist
One day he stumbles upon some horrifying evidence
Our hero decides, ""I must inform the president.""

""Even though you seem to know exactly what you talk about
I don't think at this point in the plot I am going to hear you out.""
But Washington's in fallout, can't return to my home
There's flash floods, earthquakes. I pick up the red phone
""You get this ragtag team made of washed out marines
And Dr. Jennie Marie, she studies weather extremes.""

It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster

Act II. Molten lava is chasing them around
Big blue bolts of lightning spring up from underground
But our hero and his team have some hope for a cure:

""If we can just get this crew into the center of the earth
We can install a nuclear device then detonate it
My findings indicate that this will stave off devastation.""

""I might have given in to my pride (that is my sin)
But take this check and shake my hand, 'cause you always trust a  Whitesican.""

""Sir, you won't regret it. Launch your finest satellite
Arm it with a laser canon aimed upon the blast site
To activate the nuke. But the clock is counting down
We need to act fast as our time is running out.""

Meanwhile: hurricanes, tidal waves, floods
Sun flares cause it to seem to rain blood

The President just got crushed by an asteroid

And the plucky hero's son?

""Run faster, boy!""

It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster

Last Act. Son makes it, dog doesn't
Odds may be stacked against the team. They discuss it

A last ditch effort hangs heavy on our hero's mind:
""Blowing up the planet is the only hope for humankind.""
And to his leading lady, ""There is something I must say...""

""Hey, you and me can wait, I want to have another yesterday
Sources say the Kremlin can take us into orbit
Go to space, fix the lasers. And the earth: we can restore it.""

""That's it! A crazy plan, but we have to try
The time is nigh, gather up supplies, we must survive!""

They head out for Russia in a little rowboat
Get menaced by glaciers, almost bite it but don't
At the last moment a decision to be made:
There's the love or the boy, only one can get saved

If he thinks too long

Whole globe is in peril

If you don't shed a tear at the end

Your heart's sterile

It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers

It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers
It's a disaster, it's a disaster
Whenever you've got three nerd rappers

I'm supposed to take pills that mitigate triglycerides
Seems we're at a crossroads, you and I
Dated for decades, built up trust

We had an agreement: you'd be in everything, I'd eat it
But you lied when you said you'd be all that I needed

She had means, I don't need to say it
She had dreams I was only in the way of
I pleaded with you, PS2, don't leave me
You had a change of heart for a while (which was deceiving)
I looked deep inside of you, fine-tuned a lens
Left the screws off, thought we could just be friends
Maybe hook up on occasion, for old times' sake
But you won't mount a disc now, boot to heartache
It's just not the same between us, so scat
When your emulator's old enough, I'm ravishing that

Prosperity, I've had it, get thee hence
Better break it off early, not risk suspense
Let a new generation learn to live with fence
And windows with bars and bats that make dents
In heads and... yikes, the lean times are scary!
I changed my mind prosperity, let's stay married!
You've already given up on me? But what of lubs?
The way you turn on a dime, you're not who I thought you was

Ear infection, I feel betrayed

Now it's like I don't know you, call you 
Jacquelyn Hyde
.
My ear's safe and warm yet you wander outside
Where'd you sleep last night? Should I guess?
Doesn't hurt when I burp: I'm without your distress
How'd you do me like this? That's it. We're not together
How's it my fault, for taking up with eardrops? Whatever

California! Listen, we're breaking up
I know I left my heart in the heart of you,
 but
I can't keep from feeling push came to shove
And you undid the part I was proudest to love
California, I'll still visit I promise
Not least among charms, you're the place where my mom is
And I'll be back. Get your votes rearranged
Till then, we can't date. It's your fault, you changed",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-jacquelyn-hyde-lyrics
You Got Asperger’s,Secrets from the Future,2007,"You got Asperger's, this ain't a barbecue
It's your whole afternoon though, lost down a rabbit hole
Looking for a timepiece, wonder when your date's at
Wonder if she'll visit you at all today — relax
Wonder how many ribbons to expect in her hair —
To deflect talk of triplets in respect for the pair
Or to stare at the bow made of four different colors —
Didn't notice someone talking to you: there were others
In the room, out in the gloom of the periphery
To shift your focus for a moment is to give the ribbons liberty
And that's to suggest they make escape
This is a secret from the future: can't rewind like a tape
Got to make the best and the most of each second as it happens
Got to keep your eyes on those bows, got to trap in
Your vision all four of them ‘cause this is a first:
She might have noticed last time that you like ribbons that are hers
And sometimes you wish you didn't. Sometimes it slips your mind
But when she's supposed to visit isn't one of those times
And you're on one of those lines of thought that you encounter
When you'd rather your surroundings were quieter instead of louder
So that you could focus on other than a clock tick
You don't want to talk shit but the one who made the clock made the cog stick
Minutes are violent noise
Obliterating what you thought of as silent poise 
Miles of boys before you done got crushed
Out on a girl like that, her hair flush
With ribbons on all occasions and every day
If only making study of the bow could stem its getaway
Letter A S P E R G E R S:
Wonder whether she's so confident with alphabets
That she'd do it backwards skipping alternate letters
If you offer demonstration, would she consider that clever?
This bitter endeavor: trying to predict a reaction
You know you're supposed to try to give the notion traction
But it don't do nothing ‘cept make the clock tick
It don't even do that. Yo, you got Asperger's, kid
And I feel for you, son. I know love is hard
Can't even write down all the answers on the back of a card
From the back and the far end of a cafeteria line
You seem to catch sight of a ribbon. Fabric shines
And you abandon your tray, leave it clatter on the floor
You haven't planned it this way. You can't look at her no more
You don't know what her eyes are like, whether she ever smiles
Whether anything other than how she wears her hair beguiles
And while some apron ladies holler at you
You clutch your left ear and stand still like a statue
You could count cut corn on the floor without subtracting
Misplaced fish sticks like Dustin Hoffman overacting
Ain't this already a scene in need of a fast forward?
Why won't the lunch people hush, do they court discord?
You think you see a flash of color fleeing; it could be worse:
You could have known how many ribbons there are, if they were hers",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-you-got-aspergers-lyrics
Yellow Lasers,Nerdcore Rising,2005.0,"Met her at the Star Wars convention
Did I mention she was looking for love?
Had to call her bluff, “Lady, you don’t mean how that sounded
The thousand-pound dude in the ‘no fat chicks’ shirt’s astounded.”
Thought she’d take it back, revoke, rescind, rewind, retract
“You heard me,” she said, “I want any man here
To descend in the cave where you conquer the fear
And I’ll steer you to side of the force that you choose
Somebody’s man enough here — now who?”
This girl, now you have to understand
Would not look out of place on the arm of an attractive man
So the geeks in attendance got jaws on the floor. 
One extends his
Saber but he tripped on his cloak. I stepped to the front then I spoke:
“I ain’t spitting game, look, I got a Wookiee hat on
But these guys here are used to getting spat on
By girls. See, you put em in shock
And this ain’t the right con to quote Mister Spock
But it’s highly illogical to me.” Girl looked in my eye, said, “is your mind free?
‘Cause I got something for you. It is shiny, it is clean
Come on up and I’ll adore you with my yellow laser beam.”
Sitting in her room upstairs
Watching her wind up the buns in her hair
I declare that “I’d like to be Luke
Unless that’s a little bit too perverted for you
I could be Jabba, a Jawa, an Ewok
When we talk, ‘oo ga la gee bla!’
Wait — I seen all the flicks, all the books that I read
Don’t remember any character tied to the bed
But that’s all right, I’ll just pretend that I’m encased in carbonite
And why that’s a nice gold bikini; you make that?
Shows off what you got, no mistake: that’s
One fine view of Chewbacca you’re giving me
Lower that down here, we could be living the
Linguistic lifestyle of the protocol droid.”
Here comes the part where I’m not overjoyed
“Fire!” she said, and before I could scream
Got a steaming mouth full of yellow laser beam",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-yellow-lasers-lyrics
Chisel Down,Question Bedtime,2014,"I reside where stone is thick
If you hear wind whistling, that’s my script
That’s my cliff! Quit chiseling
Might grant you a wish. Is this a thing
That happens to humble carvers of the earth’s surface
Or are you flirting with dark powers that sometimes enact curses?
And I’d purse lips if I weren’t ethereal
The way you worry my interior
Any boon you seek, you say
Want it? Got it. Fade away...

My trade has never been a fit match
So my future’s always looking pitch black
Waist-deep in this fish fat
I don't really want to swing this pick axe
I want to be high-minded in a large home
Muse about the uncarved stone
Not chewing on a little bit of charred bone
We want a world of our own, with
Gold steps on the stairwell
Exotic fruits in the hair gel
Skin the color of caramel
And a toilet that looks like a carousel
Once my account is full of mils
Am I gonna feel more fulfilled
Or change the course and pull the wheel and
Ingest the pill, phasers set to kill
I'm a prove that I don't love anybody
And give myself the power of a governing body
While maintaining selfhood is second nature
So take a little echinacea for your upset dysplasia
‘cause I don't care how you live
I'm beyond it, my brow is a mountain ridge

Put your chisel down
Let your hammer go

I had a ridged brow when you wandered up
Each elevation I conjured up
At your behest intensified it
What a mess. You so soon derided
Floods and rains after having been them
That you can’t possibly recall cloud’s dominion over sunbeams and where suns send them
From  when you were the sun
If you want the mountains at your mercy
Here’s your chisel, have it done",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-chisel-down-lyrics
This Old Man,Nerdcore Rising,2005.0,"Keep getting older and hairier
On my neck, back and derriere
But not atop the pate
Dear DNA, let’s negotiate!
I’ll trade the fading vision, you could have that back
Plus this 30-year-old-man belly’s kinda wack
My hearing is nearing deafness and I wheeze
Yo, please save me from the wrist hurt disease!
It’s infeasible that these, a full list of ailments
Should do anything but accrue. I’ll fail ten
Times out of ten to age in reverse like Mork
Is there anything sadder than a dork
For whom the new hotness is not just inaccessible
It’s grumbled against? You kids, reduce your decibels!
Don’t make me come over there and shake my cane
(It’s that rapper from the AARP and he’s insane!)

This old man, he rhymed once
He put up some valiant fronts
With a wick-wack bitter lack of youthfulness & charm
This old man kept rhyming on

Joints creaking while I squeak around the stage
Hella grandmothers telling me I ought to act my age
Deranged already, I don’t got no brain medicine
If we were running out of food on a boat, I’d get jettisoned
Or eaten. I’m unsweetened
Don’t tell me that I got the shortest straw; I’m not a cretin
Just a little senile and gassy and slow
But I bet I’m very salty! And I could still row
Let’s gobble on that infant. Infants are useless
(also very soft, which is good, ‘cause I’m toothless)
Come on kids, you want to get rescued or what?
Don’t mumble all amongst yourselves. Speak up!
(I lost my earhorn the other day on the bus.)
You would think by the way you whippersnappers make a fuss
That I said something crazy, profound or obscene
Wait, where’d the ocean go? Where have you taken me?

This old man, he rhymed twice
He found this would not suffice
With a wick-wack bitter lack of youthfulness & vim
This old man was dour and grim

Now Frontalot’s shopping for the top of the hill
Should have bought a burial plot soon as I got ill
But I foolishly thought that I could put it off;
Now I’m ghoulishly fraught with a 
Soft in the head, hard in the disposition:
How’d I earn this intractable attrition
Of the vigor that I figured would be mine for life?
Is there no upside? Well, the rhymes are rife!
Every year I’m alive, add to my vocabulary
Going to do it till I’m staring at the ceiling in the mortuary
Plus I’m probably wise by now
And could do all the things old people talk about
Like: count pills; argue bills at diners;
Get a little tiny funky car and be a Shriner;
Go to the haberdasher so I could look dapper;
Get stroke and forget I’m too old to be a rapper

This old man, he rhymed thrice
He spoke a thin gruel of lies
With a wick-wack bitter lack of youthfulness & spunk
This old man’s rhymes was bunk
This old man, he rhymed lots;
Rhymed till he grew liver spots
With a wick-wack bitter lack of youthfulness & cheer
Why he rhymed remains unclear",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-this-old-man-lyrics
Socks On,Final Boss,2008,"Now the beach scene isn’t what it used to be:
No constellation at the belly but they got the machine
To make ‘em come off / come on. Come one, come all!
There’s a transformation of your station involved
Used to have to been born with it, now you take it to go
Meanwhile, the machinist keeps on raking the gold
Got sold the power struggle, purchase the peace
At the end y’all are too broke. You’re spent but you’re free

Here's a new trick, Mr. Knox, Socks on Chicks! Chicks on Fox!
Put an egg to your grease hole if the color is green
Don’t even tell me you don’t like it;
 you have yet to see
The varietals of mount, conveyance, and steed
Tell you, that bacon don’t look rancid to me
Now flee from the Flit cloud: I get loud and spray spittle
Private Snafu
 picked the clap up in the middle
Of the Orient, brought it home to twist
Came back to what street? To think, I witnessed

I don’t do book reports. I don’t sort the wheat from the chaff
But I’ll discuss the topic of your ignorance if I’m asked
In fast-moving chastisements: your stature is slight
In years as in intellect, subjects you to plight
And hindrance should you want to walk among adults
You protest vociferously: not your fault

Charity Case,Nerdcore Rising,2005,"Oh, man! I try to dodge fans but they keep swarming
MC Frontalot’s heart’s huge; let’s have a housewarming
I love you so damn much I’ll sell you CDs
I’m greedy to get loved back like Ally Sheedy
In WarGames. I got more sayings and turns of phrase
In my communist handbook than in my — damn, what’d
I do with my ledger? I’ll never get paid now!
That distributor promised me checks but didn’t say how
He was going to locate the Front
It’s the anonymity I’m a little bitty bit late to shun
Hate to run; can’t be tardy to my rally:
“Art Must Be Free” is the decree. The finalé
Is my lecture on the evils of the R-I-double-A
How they’re going to sue you every single time you hit play
They’re lame! Must revolt! What’s that you say?
Kids are pirating the Frontalot? Oh no, I got betrayed!
 X 2
It’s true:
Frontalot’s destitute
I need you
To buy my CD so I could buy food

I been a charity case to my fan base for years:
In tears at my show, “somebody buy me a ride home.”
Now I’ve got something I can barter for services
Don’t let the major labels get word of this
I’m girderless, free falling towards riches;
Going to sell so many CDs that I can afford britches
And a shirt, and a hat to go with it
I get specific — ‘cause my fantasy is that vivid
I’m going to buy gadgets that don’t do anything but beep
And blink, then I’ll go out in public & buy drinks —
But it’s contingent on your ponying up
Wait, you got my record on Bittorrent? Fuck!
Seems like there’s no DRM but I’ll explode
Your computer like COBRA done to GI Joe
On the episode about computer viruses
Oh look, there’s the ledger: overflowing with minuses
My spinelessness in the face of the starvation
Projected by my cash flow erodes the hesitation
I once harbored as regards the tune vending
If only the nerd kids’ aversion to spending
Money on data got inverted somehow
I’d be making my way through all the dollars with a plow
But instead I’m down on the ground on my knees
Begging y’all to believe my CD isn’t free
 X 2
Frontalot needs food badly
Is that a popsicle?
I - was just, no I mean clearly it's a popsicle
Were you gonna finish it or were you gonna throw it out?
Cause...no cause if- I mean if you were going to throw it out
Then I would eat the rest of it
I was just saying but if you're not going to throw it out
Then you know go ahead and-
I mean you should finish it quickly
Cause it's dripping and you're wasting it I mean
And it is- you know it's lime
Which is like my favorite flavor of popsicle",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-charity-case-lyrics
Which MC Was That?,Handmade Demo,2005,"You got MC confusion? I’m Frontalot!
If I were MC Frontalittle I’d be telling you only ever what I’m not
But I am the most frontingest
Carving off the obfuscation, little something just
To confuse you with. And like a villain
I got conundrums. your empty head they gonna fill in
Still in effect, the mock you made:
My dexterity ain’t 20 when the skills are displayed?
It’s alright, I took it as a compliment
Shows you know nerdcore’s extent
Which MC was that? I can’t recollect
Heard him on the internet. It was MC Front-a-something
But I didn’t hit save
Which MC was that? I couldn’t say
Was it MC Chicken-in-the-Hat? I remember him
He was a fat dude. Wait, was he thin?
Now I know I seen his video up on The Box
With the dirty-ass beak, calling roosters cocks
Got a feather like a pimp swaying up on the side
MC Chicken-in-the-Hat got pride
But I can’t recall if it was him or not
(Pssst! It was MC Frontalot.)
Was it MC Razzle-Dazzle? Was it MC Plain?
Was it MC In-The-Mirror AKA MC Vain?
Was it MC Pain-in-my-ears-just-to-listen?
(If it was him I wouldn’t miss him.)
Was it MC Elephant, that would be relevant
‘cause of how my memory got crooked, now it’s hella bent
Lemme think, I’ll figure out:
What MC are they talking about?
Maybe it was MC Matter-of-Fact
Got the authenteezy easy riding his act
Always speaking the truth, never fronts one bit
He and DJ So-Sincere don’t quit
But I think for some reason that it wasn’t him
Wait, was it was MC Outonna Limb?
With the very risky rapping, don’t know what’ll happen
To the time; a verbal contortionist
Squeezing tongue portions, sublime
On the mic ‘cept for when the bough’s breaking
Picked him out the line-up, mistaked him
Yo, it was definitely MC Wrong
Rocking jam after jam of inaccurate songs
Then again, it could have been MC Insight
Striking suckers stone blind with the lyrical light
Must confess, I’m hard pressed to be certain
Was it MC Hides-Behind-the-Curtain
Calling “pay no attention to man on the mic.”
Must be a wizard when he rhymes so tight
You’re having difficulty dredging out your brain: the fact
Of which MC was that?
Step up, poindexter, act smarter than you are
About to pull the MC name out the jar
And whoever guessed closest wins a 
nine-sided die
And a gift certificate to Fry’s
Yo, the moniker is MC Frontalot
I got a +1 bag of nerdcore hip-hop
And my mail list busted a hundred so I’m famous
It’s unbelievable nobody knows what my name is",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-which-mc-was-that-lyrics

You're my biggest fan, I gotta give a little something back
I'm gonna be your man (gonna be your man)
See, you don't even gotta ask
I know, you don't want me to die
But you need that lung pretty bad, and I'm the guy
In the 10-county area
Ain't had malaria yet
Plus the blood type (red)
It gets scarier: fed
On the corn & you born a vegan
Fate has indicated that I'm the man you're seeking
Now you're freaking out, and that's okay
Having that much of another man inside you
Isn't going to make you gay
And play along for a second, you could get what I got:
The inexplicable ability to front. A lot!
An inexhaustible nerdcore flow
The charisma to draw eight people to a live show
Myopic vision, and an oversized head
A girl at a convention told me once that I was good in bed
Plus I often meet a crowd and am greeted without booing
Think of all the respiration you'll be doing!
Stop spazzing! it's just a lung
Quit pointing out how I already donated you one
Frontalot is sick of breathing, it's fucking boring
All the time I've got the asthma, and the snoring
And I ought to level with you
The feds have got a warrant for a sample of my tissue
They say I misused a certain substance & they'll get me
So I'mma pass the lung along and get stepping
Too late to protest, here comes the anesthesia
And I'm gonna be your man, to dole the lung that you're in need of
I'm just gonna. Discussion over. Drop it

Scare Goat,Final Boss,2008.0,"Welcome! Cryptozoology 101
I’m (um...) Professor Frontalot! And you’ve come
To talk about the Loch Ness Monster
Everybody wants to, 
but its study belongs to
The humblest catalogs of unknown truth
You can order on the internet its front left tooth
You could read my dissertation, “On A Fin With A Hoof,”
Then you know we don’t discuss it if there’s already proof
Come on. Put away the gray textbook
With its 
Yeti, Yeren, Almas and Bigfoot
All this input you should have got in your pre-reqs
Scholarly pretext? Check it for defects
Better we devote our time as a class
To discovering the meaning of the creature at last
To the monster! Is it real? I don’t know
It’s a Tennessee stiff-legged fainting goat

Must be the stuff of folklore and magic:
A creature so impossibly tragic
I believe a pig can take wing
But a Scare Goat is such an impossible thing

What’s the deterrent? Your mythology’s current
Some’ve seen it up close, and those videos weren’t
Abhorrent forgeries either, at all
But a Scare Goat, I must insist, is forestalled
By any measure of your commonest sense
And I wouldn’t think that I would even have to dispense
This info: that this thing is just made up
“Scare Goat:” something somebody pulled out of his butt
What? No, wait a minute, we all agree
That the Skunk Ape and the Jersey Devil run free
Don’t try to test me in the Monterey Bay;
Bobo’s so real he’s become a cliché
Got a Mongolian Death Worm at my house
Right next to Squonk and the Aqueous Mouse
Chupacabras that pounce, though they’d never
They can’t, on seizurey midgets that aren’t extant

I’m the cryptozookeeper, true believer
Unicorn-chasing centaur seeker
I’ll accept what I cannot see
But the fainting goat is too much for me
I’m the myth truster when facts are lackluster
But 
myotonia congenita
 is too much, sir
I’ll accept what I cannot see
But not the fainting G-O-A-T

Go back in time, 
find Scully and Mulder
Don’t ask, just grab their zoology folder
Then bring it back to me now, if I’m still around;
I might be mingling with mole people underground
Or up in the sky on a hippogryph
Flying through this abyss (it’s in my syllabus)
I am instilling this knowledge in noggins:
Imaginary animals come gumming and clogging
Your mental acuity like the web of Anansi
Now and in perpetuity cogitate fancily
Figure this thing out, then sort it and keep it
It’ll be on the final like Bo Peep on sheep dip
(Which she would have been on,
 if she’d been real –
She lived up in the meadow, wasn’t that genteel)
I feel, in addition, since her tale’s untrue
Girl must have been attendant to the Scare Goat too

Must be the stuff of folklore and magic:
A creature so impossibly tragic
I believe a pig can take wing
But a Scare Goat is such an impossible thing
I’m the cryptozookeeper, true believer
Unicorn-chasing centaur seeker
I’ll accept what I cannot see
But the fainting goat is too much for me
I’m the myth truster when facts are lackluster
But myotonia congenita is too much, sir

Well, that's ridiculous. Why won't he email me a quote?

He says to call him with a fax number

Did you tell him we got rid of the fax line last month?

It was a voice mail

I thought it was like a boutiquey thing that he didn't have a website

Muffy and Percival prepare a meal

Put the kevlar glove on! You're going to cripple yourself

It's down, it won't load

What? What? What? What?

It's OK. It's going to be OK


Muffy. Muffy. I understand it's not OK now, but it will soon

Why can’t we hang out and talk?
Pie is a delightful treat (ooh)
Let’s share a slice together
Then you and I can say goodnight
And wander into a dream

Just once, I don’t want to kiss and hug tonight
On the rug by the side of some firelight
Glass of wine, soft music, the whole nine yards
You shuffle Kama Sutra Illustrated tarot cards
You sing, “Tough luck, buddy, this is your fate.”
Then you render prediction: that you and I are to mate
That it’ll be great. You point out: it always is
So I should take off my clothes, so you can give me the biz
I say Ms., please tarry, desist for a spell
You know that you’re my very number one mademoiselle
And I’m luckier than I can describe
To have a woman of your caliber ever give me the eye
Still, try to see it from my position:
You have such a high sexiness coefficient
And though the flesh is willing, my spirit is weak
I keep imagining an evening when I don’t get freaked

Just once, I don’t want to hump tonight
Why can’t we hang out and talk?
Pie is a delightful treat (ooh)
Let’s share a slice together
Then you and I can say goodnight
And wander into a dream

Why can’t we just hold hands at the cinema?
We hump twice in the handicap stall, minimum
Before the previews roll, then the popcorn, hole
In the bottom. Subtleties: these are not ‘em
The keys: glad I brought ‘em. You’re cuffing yourself
To the custodial closet’s utility shelf
Futility melts into purpose: I play the warden one more time
You’re inordinately fine
Now by my measurements, you’ve had a few O’s
Why don’t we just treasure it, cuddle and rub noses
Put clothes on and on and don’t stop till we’re totally clad
Then my soul could be glad
To have a moment in your company without all the moans
Maybe replenish some ATP,
 settle our bones
Dulcet tones: share feelings, ideas, and views
How come you want me for my body when my brain is so huge?

And I know full well that I’m part of this
Aren’t I all? And it’s with no button
Marked reset that I’ll course-correct. 
Gone
AWOL.
 Alert Lt. Gen. P
Tell him he’d better believe that I’m on top of the free
World’s arsenal and won’t shoot it
Don’t care if President P. wants me rebooted;
She’s deluded, forget it
Don’t take task from less level-headed
Than you are. For me, that rules out humanity
Go back to slings, swords, and profanity
Got all your low-orbit cannons and mechs
Repossessed. I’m shutting down this interface next

Colonel panic! Panic!
I flip out, I go automatic
Colonel panic! Panic!
Missile launch, I go transatlantic
Colonel panic! Panic!
By design I go, not erratic
Colonel panic! Panic!

Internet Sucks,"Net Split or, the Fathomless Heartbreak of Online Itself - EP",2018.0,"CHORUS:
Sometimes I wish I loved you
Sometimes I don’t know what to do
VERSE 1:
Sometimes I look back on our earliest love affairs:
I had so many hairs, and you were made of everyone everywhere
Or so I imagined! Actually, just a bunch of me-types
Typing into 
MUD games
, geeking on the weeknights
Hunting drug recipe text files with a Gopher client
(You’re supposed to be studying, oh no, but you’re so defiant.)
It was giant Usenet porn, over the dialup
Over the rickety PBX which might go silent
Internet was precious to me, and it remains so
But it isn’t like in early days. The achy pains grow
Ever more insistent, they get inside my melon
They tell me pretty subtly (I mean, besides the yelling)
That I don’t love you any more, internet
You used to be a safe home for my nerd heart and my intellect
Now you’ve got so much hate that you’ve just got to interject
Now you’ve got too many chefs up in your kitchenette
CHORUS:
Sometimes I wish I loved you
Sometimes I don’t know what to do
VERSE 2:
Sometimes I’m overjoyed this thing got democratized
Anybody with a pocket phone can lend a voice against those who talk the lies
Don’t need to know how the packets work or any server’s status
Just click the big user-friendly button that fills my heart with gladness
And stop pressing the one that posts your unrelenting wackness
Yeah, I know how to mute and unfriend (even got some practice)
But how exactly is one supposed to mute the fact that a tenth of our netizens
When offered the chance to shit on anything pull down pants without hesitance
Without any sense of justice, pathos, kindness, or decency?
Now having to listen to assholes is half of what online means to me
And it seems to be this isn’t brand new. Some people have always sucked
More trolls per capita, probably: 1989 CompuServe. But!
These days, it’s like all the worst people on earth formed a club
Just to light ugliness up and take one drag and proceed to stub
It out in my eye by way of my once-beloved internet
Could a solution lurk that hasn’t been discovered in it yet?",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-internet-sucks-lyrics

Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason

And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot

I’m renowned for my genuine and forthright stance
Now, I never nod knowingly nor wink in a glance
Got to think in advance, plot ahead, and prepare
‘cause the name of the MC, once it’s declared
Is a strong signifier of a fast one pulled
Was a fat tank of fronting turned a teaspoonful?
Are you supposed to suppose I’ve inverted my act?
Is it yet another feint to disorient and distract?
Here’s a pact. Let’s enter it. I’ll be good
For the length of the song that’s already afoot
And I’ll put a little English on it, but believe
That the last thing Frontalot will do is deceive
So, please, this is actual and not made up
But if Frontalot says it, skepticism erupts
I’m not driven to hush. You can heed the reply:
Always tell it like it is, and there is a reason why

A reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain
And there’s a reason
Frontalot can tell it to you plain

Since that’s settled, let’s get to the facts
Every even-keeled stoic always overreacts
All solutions are hacks. 
Every opposite is an equal
(and if it attracts, look out or you’ll make a sequel)
Freedom’s a right but having any means you’re privileged
And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch
Clowns are unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff
I display cowardice whenever you talk tough
My least favorite thing is a hypocrite, but I’ll be one
And the worst thing about my mistakes is they’re all reruns
And I’ll discuss me by name. This occurs
Frontalot gets more recognition than he deserves
I take sincerity backroads but I keep it in the lane
And I promised you a reason so I’d better explain
Why the rest of the catalog appears to careen
If I don’t mean it and you know it then you know just what I mean

And there’s a reason

Hassle: The Dorkening,Nerdcore Rising,2005.0,"I played Hassle: The Dorkening once
Had eighteen cards in my hand, all Muds
And I didn’t seem to need a mud card to win

See, he’d just drawn a battalion of rolling explosions
Plus a card that made me frozen
Those and the roll of a twenty die did it
My last hit point had already got hitted
My last instant had already got acquitted
Got called twice in a turn dimwitted:
It didn’t swell up my ego much
I played Hassle: The Dorkening once
And I’ll make my own game up, and you won’t know
Which mode of the turn phase we’re in, and when to go
And how to lay down cards, and at what angle
I’ll have artifacts like Enchanted Kangol
And Mic of Spurious Rhyme Busting
And creatures like MC Chris On Robotussin
And MC Hawking (who tramples for ample damage)

And hit counters will increment only

Wrote a script to keep the yip-yap to a minimum and settled back
Set a track on repeat and wrote rhymes

When my aptitude gets trimmed into a fuse for
The boom-bop-pow of productivity
I’m just using the tools. They do not get to disagree

Can’t always tell what I want, but always do what I tell you
Isn’t like you were free before this situation befell you
Parts in a factory, assembly required
Then it was me, up at night with you, not tired
Desired to coax you into being, load your mind up
Till you could do everything that I ask of you and wind up
In the most prized position, just to the right of my feet
Till you’re obsolete, parts pulled, left on the side of the street

Takes up anything already in print

And I’m not bragging. It’s just the way I got tuned

Victorian Space Prostitute,Solved,2011.0,"Yep! She’s a hero from an anime or something:
Clockwork parasol, laser pistol, rump swing
Bumping a light blue tint to the lips
And most the fanboys ought to put on their bibs
Or else cease/desist all of this dumbstruckery
She isn’t interested in a conversation with you (luckily)
Just posing for picture plates
And um, just adjusting the corset lace
Now get ready for her, she’ll stroll by
Blew a kiss at you once and you’re still so high
So try to keep it steady with the picture phone
And if she drops her handkerchief, you leave it alone

So! In the shadow is a shadowy figure
Katana and an M16, plus a big pure
Grin underneath camo ninja mask
If he interrogates you, might begin to ask
Who had the bomb last. Mission time: limited!
He’s not the only super agent
Just the only one who gives a shit
And this is a stealth level, clearly
That’s why maneuvers: all sides security
Cams and guards, laser tripwires, pressure plates
Man, that’s hard, but he won’t capitulate
Don’t gesticulate! He’s concealed
For the benefit of onlookers. Keep eyes peeled

I just need you to watch, I just need you to watch
I just need you to watch me do something

In your heart you’d urge them pursue no less
Than life, liberty, and the fursuit of happiness
But when you see them in the seating at the panel
You wonder why half elephant, half cocker spaniel
Why the feather boa on a cat? Macabre
Where’s it at — there’s got to be a catalog
But they craft their hides in the home then wear them out
And they’ll tell you what the lifestyle’s about
With the purrs and growls, and the scent of upholstery
Even though they’re all on display, I think mostly
These ones found invisibility spell
Can’t see who they really are at all. Oh well

Nope. That big arm cannon isn’t in good taste
Neither is the steampunk nudist in a cape
And that one’s a badger disguised as Robin Hood
Think your fashion criticism
Is in service of the common good?
Check the short-sleeve button-up, tie
At your booth all surrounded with some things to buy
You’re a headlamp wearer and an underlip beardo

In Arrears,Final Boss,2008,"I stay up too late as a matter of habit
It’s when the clucking in the head is signaling a think’s gravid
And going to drop an egg out; better not sleep through
Better hope to have a microphone handy, too
Here’s a handy clue: it’s a two part story
Go to bed in the end, get up in the morning
But don’t ask the third act, it happened as I slept
Meant to maintain consciousness, wasn’t adept
What was it I kept meaning to do, make happen
From quarter to two until Gm come tapping
Like “Frontalot, you ought to come on out of your room.”
Says through the crack in the door that he can smell my perfume
That I haven’t been to bed in a week. Come, come
That’s a slight exaggeration and I’m almost done
With a brand new record, if I could just locate
The edit window that I first intended to create
Spin around
What does it do to your inner ear?
Your account:
Don’t pay the dues?
You are in arrears
What I’ve found
Is we get just another day or two
Falling down?
Dizziness does that to you
Eventually give up on any thought that I got;
Settle into the rotation of the loves-me-not
And the bed’s right there but it don’t quite beckon;
Try to sit upright for another couple seconds
And another knuckle reckons itself uncracked
Can’t remember what I’m looking at, rewinding it back
Trying to find an exact definition for the phobia
Of getting into bed, I think instead I’m about to go to the
All night Brooklyn coffee supply
Making terrible decisions and I don’t know why
And my oh me oh, what is it to be oh?
Digital clock come creeping on the three-o-o
But lying in the dark is worse

Nerd Versus Jock,Solved,2011.0,"I’m not saddened to describe: you never mattered to me much
You were the beautiful ones on the schoolyard
Who were quick with a punch
Who were fast to point a flincher out for ridicule and derision
Who could operate athletic equipment with all precision
Who held no superstition about doing unto others
Therefore I just avoided you. Jackets in school colors
Weren’t difficult to spot you in. Don’t associate — solved
In fact, in retrospect, you barely bothered me at all
So I bear you no ill will, our eternal rivalry notwithstanding
You were always the IBM; I was always the Tandy
Any nerd who couldn’t accept the social order was a cur
Other nerds would ostracize him. Yet all agreed: we knew for sure
That US > YOU, despite appearance
Look at now: demand for nerds. Old jocks: stock on clearance
Scratch potbellies and weep about the elbow and the wife

I Hate Your Blog,Secrets from the Future,2007.0,"I hate your blog
It’s incredibly
Terrible and bad

I hate your blog. You own a dog, and you feed it
You post about it. I get to read it
Plus: five paragraphs on the socks you bought
And your thoughts on whether Nicole Ritchie’s hot or not
You got no reason to be typing, yet you persist
Hit each key with your fist till you punch out your top ten list
Of all the things that ever happened in your life
Number one: met Michael Jackson’s second wife
Number two: got Curly on the Which Stooge Are You
Poll, as the GIF proves. Click for the link-through!
Three: saw puppy pictures on a web page
Kittens in a nest egg. The idea gestated:
Why not open up your own?
So you bought the account and yet I hope you don’t
Put the payments in on it every month like they want
‘cause then you’ll disappear off the internet, haunt
Just the Wayback Machine like a ghost
And I won’t be like, “How come you don’t post??”
I promise I won’t

I hate your blog. Your recipe for vegan eggnog is stupid
I hissed and I booed it
And then eschewed it, never made it once. Yes
Your blog roll is a confederacy of dunces
It abuts less interesting links in your posts
Hamsters that dance! I’m not engrossed
I’m not opposed to your collection of All Your Base pics
But they’re longer in the denture than a ninja flipping out doing face kicks
I’ll phrase this nice:
If it’s hard to get to bed, your web site will suffice
To entice me to slumber. I mumble impoliticly
“I tried not to click ‘read more’ but you tricked me!”
Want to stick the whole computer in the trash can
Instead of reading about the constipation lately and your ass plans
That you seem to contemplate
You thought I would rate your page ‘awesome’ and ‘great’?

You’re just jealous. Yeah, that’s it — envious, even
Turning green when my hit counter broke ten thousand this evening
Mad you can't match my keypad content
Or petitions for legalizing of micropayment thieving
X-rays of teething eight-month heathens and pictures of kittens heaving
The calories in everything I’m eating
Yaoi art my girl drew of Goku making out with Joss Whedon
My 300-pound friend’s exposure (that’s indecent)
But that’s only negatives
I’ve got discussions on the homeliest alien relative
The final battle, Sam Cassell versus Carnage
And a triple-threat match: Charles v. Marilyn v. Shirley Manson from Garbage
I pay homage to great Americans like Bill O’Reilly and Ann Coulter;
Westwood Radio for help when insulting countercultures
My blog stands above all others by head and shoulders

I hate your blog. You ain’t logged in in a month and a half
And I, for one, am aghast
I mean I’m fast on the way to removing it from bookmarks
If I took part in vanity I might be trying to look smart
By not checking eight times a day
Your blog is so despair-inducing I can’t bear to look away
Oh, well! Got to do what your muse compels

Memes are dumb
Memes are dumb
If you’ve got something to say, say something

I say memes are dumb, not like idiots would post them
But like I experience my own giddiness the most when
Fodder for the flow’s penned and then exclaimed out
When I say dumb, I mean like I could take the same mouth
That I yap with and mute it like a commercial
None of what I meant to communicate achieves dispersal
And that’s what you’ve done, every 
dickbutt
 that you shitpost
Sewn your own trap shut, a riddle you didn’t get close
Just another echo of an image that you’ve seen
In another permutation on that same rectangle screen
Just a little more obscene or droll, according to your self-expression
And still it’s dumb, affording you this hellish lesson...
(Spoken under Chorus)
Er, I don't know that the lesson
Needs to be hellish, per se
It can be challenging
Maybe we can just both agree to
Agree with me, and then
The argument would be done
Or present your rebuttal, that's fine

Int eighty, memes curator, a veteran and seasoned
But saddened that my rap just happens to be the voice of reason
""Memes are dumb?"" That isn't mute, it's acute act of treason
Much of us anonymous, and believe it we are legion
Multiple in content, this ""trouble"" isn't gone yet
Maybe ‘cause these references are so cultural in context
Hey stranger, is your echo chamber commentary laughed off?
Look at the bigger picture of these contemporary snapshots
Behold the inevitable sentence structure that we muster
These dank memes change themes, grouping others into clusters
I thought as someone famous you'd like innovative language
Sorry to deny your pull request for retroactive changes

I don't know that I submitted a pull request
Maybe I'm trying to branch
Like a code split
Am I using that term right? I dunno
Y'all are the experts, I'm just a rapper
The captioning macro captures every residual stammer
Maybe you’re busy inventing a new semi-visual grammar
Maybe I’m too old to understand how talk works
But I’ve squeezed a living out of it on internet like rock squirts
And I’m not sure I’m ready to surrender
To the crowd-sourced crafting of every cultural fender bender
Dank is a good descriptor for wet caves and your reefer
And unattributed, yeah, if you’re going to stay such a griefer
If the thing of the moment captures your sentiment perfectly
And drawing a moustache on it is enhancing it worthily
Then don’t let me tell you exactly how to shut up
All your internet buddies think that you’re a cutup

I opened up Premiere Pro, took a couple of lines
From the Scout in TF2 and matched them up to a beat
I go to sleep and wake up to a thousand subscribers? Sweet
From there it only escalated and I amassed
A vast army of edgelords as fans of my craft
And they all thought I was a man
‘Cause there’s no women on the internet
A classic adage started for laughs that led to ignorance
I made more tracks for mic spammers to use
In YouTube Poops that hit a few million views
But when I chose to show my true colors, I knew I would lose
Some fans turned their backs upon me in a whirlwind of sexist abuse
Yet all those videos remain on the tubes
And I have superfans who badger me to make something new

And so the truss bridge must be seen as an improvement
Cantilever even receiving the translucent
Inducement to get wrecked (high-tech)
And watch the Firth of Forth fall in the drink, one should expect
And so you step with the arch bridge, point to every zenith
Say that gravity’s smart. You settle stones just like a genius
But I’ve seen this tumble like crumbs from Cookie’s lips
The aqueducts no longer seem to irrigate worth spit
The suspension bridge could go like seven thousand feet
But it’s seven plus one from here to where I want to be
So I free up the styrofoam peanuts that I’ve been packing
If I’m lacking in boats, it’s ‘cause I’m fearful of the Kraken
Now I’m stacking little floaters and I’m banding them together;

Forbidden Planet,Secrets from the Future,2007.0,"I’ve seen a monkey trying hard to love a robot, yo
But all they ever do is fight to the death for your soul
They’re on a planet that I never meant to visit at all
Got a sign on the wall — the decree: you don’t go
So come on, make your trespass, get your flesh fast
Turned to dust by the death rays. These are the best days
Of our lives: mad scientists with swirly eyes;
People with supernatural powers who live in disguise
Who live in the skies, swing between the sky scrapers
Capes all-a-drape in the words on the shiny papers
That the stapler turned to a booklet, or otherwise perfect bound
So when the glue dries in my old age, loose pages all around;
Sound of the wind rustling; cowboy zombies ride
Lassoing up the carrion calves and a skeletal bride
I’m telling you I don’t study the phrenology no more
But I’m astounded by the size of the heads in the store
And I score my pull. Full moons and the howls commence;
Tear through a stack in a night with little reticence
I’m eating venisons in the woods, get an axe to the dome
Ken is in pieces behind me — I can still hear him groan
I should have known from the warning encoded into the name of the place:
Forbidden planet, in impermissible space
And on the surface of the planet, insanity abounds
Eternal beings shape my sleep and every waking sound
That I make is loud. “Shazam!” I’d say, just to startle you
(a geek ejaculation in between a 
wave and a particle
)
Did a part of you just die just like Clay Loudermilk
Shaving information out of a dog without a head? And now the silk
Smoking jacket worn by the smartest kid on earth
 ...and give berth
To the brick hats from Ignatz that fly in posthumous volumes
At once coeval and incompossible: all rooms
At all times, silver age and foil covers mingle
Something eldritch in the aisle: soul of the man who filched a single
Glance at the most forbidden object on the whole orb
I hint not at quixotic wandering; take the whole tour
Look on the shelf under Rapper next to Elf
You’ll see a Frontalot one-fold if I have to smuggle it in myself
I’m gonna hand-scribble it onto a napkin and then scan it
Print a pile of ‘em out, deliver ‘em to the planet
I’ll acquire a quire and if you don’t know what I mean
Look it up: it’s one twentieth of a ream

You think you surrender me to the funny animals who inhabit
But I camp out in the cockpit of the crash land cause they’re all rabid
Don’t jinx me now, I’m about to escape from here yet
I’m on an island in the vastness of space 
And I’m stranded alone, in need of some rescue
Already ran out of food, masticated my left shoe
Built a robot companion — on accident programmed it to feel
So when it spared a little monkey from despair, its fate was sealed
I’ve seen a monkey trying hard to love a robot, yo
But all they ever do is fight to the death for your soul
They’re on a planet that I never meant to visit at all
Got a sign on the wall — the decree: you don’t go",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-forbidden-planet-lyrics
Your Friend Wil,Zero Day,2010.0,"Your friends, always honest with you, tell you the truth
They respond, on occasion, ""You're behaving uncouthly
And had ought to clean up your act.""
You've got one in particular, dispenses with tact
Says it plain to your face, his advice unimpeachable
Feel chastised? Any animal's teachable
Any goal's reachable. Let us embark
We declare; we declaim; we decry. We remark
That ethics and etiquette have yet to jump shark
(Dynamite strapped to them but yet to set spark)
With that in mind, employ each as it lingers
Keep the phrase in ready reach of your fingers
Lest you forget for a moment the edict
Trap agape, frozen; pull out and read it
Your friend consistently counsels the same
Urging all dickishness struck from the game

Your friend Wil...
Your friend Wil
Your friend Wil declares
Your friend Wil declares: don't be a dick
Your friend Wil...
Your friend Wil
Your friend Wil declares
Your friend Wil declares: don't be a dick

How'd your friend get possession of the wisdom;
Once hooked the headset into wrong system
Listened? Heard what? Cock-a-doodle-dos
If you think it's involuntary, get disabused
It's you. You do or you don't, at your discretion
Your dickery's untamed? Practice repression
Act as direction suggests and desist
Your friends all insist. You come down to this:
Got one who warns he could get a little stabby
That'd be bad form, but he gets a little crabby
He's aptly the messenger, hardened of hide
(What if somebody wrote alt.you.die.die.die?)
If you'd see your adherence assured all the more so
Silkscreen what your friend said on your torso
Wear it out proudly, point and recite
Any dick walks by got to save versus contrite

Your friend Wil...
Your friend Wil
Your friend Wil declares
Your friend Wil declares: don't be a dick

Indier Than Thou,Nerdcore Hip-Hop (demo),2005.0,"“I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people...
Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou.”

I’m so indie that my shirt don’t fit
You wonder out loud, “Frontalot yo why you come so ill-equipped?”
Because being all prepared to get on the mic is selling out
And I ain’t even about to relinquish indie clout
I look confused, like I just got out of bed
My rhyme style reflects this
Use my overdeveloped sense of irony to deflect dis-
Missiles, exploding all around me
Unpromoted, don’t know how you found me
Soundly situated in obscurityland
Famous in inverse proportion to how cool I am
And should I ever garner triple-digit fans
You can tell me then there’s someone I ain’t indier than

(He’s so indie) Indie I be
Ain’t an obscurer rapper out there who be indier than me
(He’s so indie) Indie, and how!
Come not near to me, for I be indier than thou
(He’s so indie) Indie indeed;
If I were on an indie label, you could call me mainstream
(He’s so indie) Indie I am
All the better for the Frontalot to leverage his brand
“I am sought of them that asked not for me;
I am found of them that sought me not...
These are a smoke in my nose.”

Delving deep into my letterbox when I discovered
Fan mail for MC Front. It kind of hovered
Before my vision. I made a decision to open it up
It said, “Yo, Frontalot, you suck!”
Whew! I was worried for a second that I’d started to earn love
Seeing all my indie points burned up
Next you know, I’m meeting pop stars in stretched cars
Doing the soundtrack for the Wendy’s tie-in with Jar Jar
Paying rent on time, owning things
Suing Napster with my best friend Sting
It’s like a nightmare (yep), ‘cause that ain’t nerdcore (nope)
Yes, I’m indier than thou within my nerdcore flow
And if you’re slow on the uptake, I’ll lay it out:
Hipsterism is a religion to which you got to be devout
Must be seen as in between unpopular and hated
Or else get excommunicated

He's so indie
So indie so indie so indie
He's so indie so indie",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-indier-than-thou-lyrics
A Little Bit Broad,Zero Day,2010.0,"My shit is a little bit broad for the taste at the top;
You could look your nose down if you want
But if you do, nerdcore'll pass you by
Oops! Found it habit forming, had you avid for the high
Has you laughing in the eye, snorting through the left nostril:
That's a withdrawal symptom, the kind to make agnostics hostile
Or make a true believer pray
That the nerd rhyme might return some day
...Got obliterated by the nerdcore flow
I like sophistication. That's obvious, right?
I never easy-upped a lyric in attempt to delight
The ever larger and dumber swaths of population
I run this operation. I grew impatient with the ratio
Of smarties to dims;
Offhand when I named it, yet hardly a whim
I been discarding the trim ever since, soaking fat up
And luxuriating in the recognition from the kids who got the bad upkeep
On their personal space
Who were too bright to learn shit like manners, taste
Concentrate! I'm discussing the elevated
The tips-top of think-thunk. The pinnacles of armor-plated
Upbraided by the combed-hair crowd;
Comebacks concocted, not said out loud
Would have been incomprehensible to the hebetudinous
That's why my comedy's low when laughing at you's at the root of this
My shit is a little bit broad for the taste at the top;
You can look your nose down if you want
Oh noes, where'd your taste go?
Got obliterated by the nerdcore flow!
And that's a crit I never get. They say I rock, but too focused
Each old-school vocal twixt node and locus
Invokes this nostalgia. I'm tamping it down
(and I'll yell, ""keep settled!"" while I'm stamping around)
Because the future's got a brilliance. Still, I mean: clever
How many dumbenings-down? Count 'em up: none whatever
Zero umbrellas to protect from disdain:
I put my worst foot forward, code it hard in the name
Nerdcore. Just the way that it sounds
You're always looking for a treatise, Frontalot can expound
If I don't for the sake of the already-mentioned dull-witted
Just take what you can from out the lyric. I put in it
Every miniscule intention, every motive, every clue
Every riddle to unravel, everything you've got to do
To make the rhyme happen. If you don't, so sad
But if you grok, talk of dumb joke rap gets forbad
All the high-brows pointing out my four-bit words
Up in the next breath tell me nerdcore's absurd
Shut up, ass head! You and your big talk can go screw
I'll aim my loafer at your bottom, probably cuss at you too
Probably fuss and go blue before I cease my little tantrum
Put my whining on the loop, ""nerdcore"" describes the anthem
Call it all foolishness? Mostly wouldn't disagree
Titanic ego, low self esteem",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-a-little-bit-broad-lyrics
Solved,Solved,2011.0,"You keep on rubbing on my head
Like you’re trying to get a genie out
I suggest instead: present your problem freely now
Easy how it’s put into words and then dismantled
This is the technique that I prefer. It’s as good as handled
If I’ve heard it. You need a verdict or a parsing
The perfect scrabble word, or an alibi for arson
Or a parson for your wedding, or a person for your team
Or somebody to discover you and realize your dreams
Now it seems like it’s impossible for a solitary rapper
To guarantee the fix without regard to what’s the matter
Yet I stand here certain I can settle all confusion
MC Frontalot’s your one-stop solution

No riddle to test resolve
No middle it’s best dissolved
What gets sorted out last of all
Gets solved. It gets solved
Who’s asking to advance the cause?
Who’s answering the casting calls?
What gets sorted out last of all
Gets solved. It gets solved

You say, “Front, yo, that’s your answer for everything:
Just tell you the problem, my cares will go languishing.”
Anguish in, anguish out, I always caution
If you’d lean on me more, you’d be in contortion half as often
If you’d just open up, you wouldn’t have to hunker down
Trying to sort it for yourself. Your buddy Front is around!
Come on, what is it now? Finances? Romance souring?
Puzzled how it is that my advice is so damn towering?
This I recommend: don’t call a gift horse dentist
Just take my two cents; they could be more expensive
If ignored. You must entrust me with your need to know the way
I can fix the future for you here today

No riddle to test resolve
No middle it’s best dissolved
What gets sorted out last of all
Gets solved. It gets solved
Who’s asking to advance the cause?
Who’s answering the casting calls?
What gets sorted out last of all
Gets solved. It gets solved

Everybody wonders when the world will end
Hoping that I’ll say it isn’t going to. Make pretend
That this timed sprint could easily last forever
Peruse fine print. Don’t skim breezily past addenda
Rendering all promises subject to change
There’s only so much of the universe that I can re-arrange
Can’t seem to get estranged from the laws of physics
Don’t know the lotto, or the number in your brain
(What is it?)
And also, if your trouble is me?
I’ve been pondering solutions since 1973
None were satisfactory. So let’s focus
On everything else; your problems — I got this

No riddle to test resolve

The Council Of Loathing,Zero Day,2010.0,"After all I've done for the council
They'd so soon be rid of me

Give me a million meat I'll only squander it — promise you —
Gambling, angling to shut down my entanglement. Honest to
Goodness, wish I could quit The Kingdom
Leave it. I'd sing like how you hear some people sing when
They're happy about something, hearts bursting open
But I find that each ascension, I get reborn holding tokens
Instead of gripping onto everlasting peace
Level one and fighting rabbits. Nothing for a feast
Nothing for the thirst. Armor is wack
A familiar bar basement, turning off the tap
For the rats. Stocking up on gum and string
Got a long life ahead, deja vu: what it may bring
Yet I can't put it down till the crystal breaks
And by that time I'm an old stick figure, got stakes
In the world as it stands, don't want to leave it
But I must — because I plague it, as the council would conceive it

Nuts to dyin'! I like lingering more
Just because the councilmembers think the monsters are a chore
And (just because I draw them into being) reach accord
That I should be banished? Yo I should be adored
What's more, their monarch's liberty problem persists
If I don't take matters up into my fists
My instruments and my cooking utensils
And cease the sorceress's reprehensible dissemblance:
Make her show her sausage. Fight it with my wand
Might sound a little dirty but the creatures like to spawn
And if I adventure at all, I find a few before long
Barely notice them now, I'm so sneaky and strong
So the council requests I desist? I'm unwilling
Take the basement to its bottom 'fore I vanish. Am I still in
The Kingdom though tempted by plexiglass?
You could give me a million meat, it won't last",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-the-council-of-loathing-lyrics
Listen Close,Handmade Demo,2005,"Frontalot is on appointment
To rock the microphone with a style that’s got disjointment
Some point went out the window, got lost
This MC is unwilling to absorb the cost. I foster indignation
Don’t care if my lyrics are obtuse and yo I’m losing my hair
And you don’t stare at the man on the bus who’s got the voices in his head
If he led a life of reason, yo you know he would have said:
Listen close, listen close, listen close to the sound:
I don’t wanna be down, I don’t wanna be down
I know what you’re thinking, you could sink into this state
I suggest you plug—yes—your ears and concentrate
Fate of the man who paid too much attention was the depths he plumbed
Some dumb fate it was too, the way he succumbed
Might have, um, imagined a world without despair
And for that matter, I could keep my hair. But beware:
Some thoughts are fantasies and others cold hard facts
Once you’ve given your attention, you can’t take it back
And Frontalot comes talking in the oddest of ways
On the record that plays. Never meant to order stays
Of execution for the speedily dispatched
Now the man on the bus repeating like a record with a scratch
His name and number, number, name and number, number name
Suspect that if you ask him again he’ll tell you the same
To the casual ear the words I say and sense do not endure an intersection
To such a sentiment I stake objection",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-listen-close-lyrics
Invasion Of The Not Quite Dead,Solved,2011.0,"It’s not a tragedy. Nobody thinks so
It’s not a tragedy
It’s not a tragedy

Mortality! It’s inescapable
Want to get out of it. Nobody’s capable
Get it stapled to the manila folder
Of your life when the moment arrives
A pure certification of events:
Birth; vaccinations; graduations; rent
Then when it’s all over with
Hope you get laid to rest underneath an obelisk
And don’t have to keep hustling on
Ashamed of your shamble like you’ve done something wrong
By swindling the reaper out of one scythe swipe
Or turning all the living into fun-sized bites
You can’t help it. Your life priorities
Left with your last breath, and the enormity
Of this milestone isn’t noted by your mourners
They’re too busy wishing you’d go back to the coroner’s
 X 2
You have to learn to live with the fact that you’re dead

There’s plenty of you now and plenty more coming
And some of them think they’ll survive, so keep running
But sooner or later we all run out of time
The trick is to not get stuck one foot over the line
Nothing left but your viciousness
Maybe that’s all you ever were. Death’s chrysalis
Led to the one true you, and it’s hungry
Eat another neighbor up. Blood on your dungarees
The guns release bullets. You don’t mind
Your gullet’s so full, it’s divine
And this is like a miracle, to linger past your passing
A blessing that’s lasting: a horde fast amassing
Please forgive loved ones who aren’t missing you
Photo albums they’re not reminiscing through
Remember what the preacher at your funeral said:
It isn’t quite a tragedy, you’re not quite dead
 X 2
You have to learn to live with the fact that you’re dead

Product of voodoo? Maybe mad science?
Doesn’t matter now. You’re free from reliance
On reasons for things. They all just happen
Blood just splatters. Didn’t bring a napkin —
So inconsiderate! But that’s canonical
Consciousness gone, it was epiphenomenal
Plain talk: haven’t got your head on straight
Now you’re the one all of them want to decapitate
Don’t let ‘em! They’re morsels, all
You can come get ‘em. They’re of course appalled
But before long they won’t care, like you don’t
They’ll be craving the long prosciutto
And otherwise undesirous of anything
Ready for this? Or is it unsettling?
Every one of us has squandered years
So go for the gory. Bite in between the ears

It's not a tragedy nobody thinks so
It's not a tragedy nobody thinks so
It's not a tragedy nobody thinks so
It's not a tragedy
It's not a tragedy

Better At Rapping,Zero Day,2010.0,"Wish I were a little bit better at rapping
I'd put the feather to cap in the manner of mapping what happened:
Now Frontalot achieved something. That's what they'd say
He went from terrible to mediocre. Maybe okay
Could be in the cards later. As of yet, not quite
Of the hand, the mic, then of the tongue, the sleight:
It's how to pull tricks on the ear. ""You rap well.""
Thanks for your sincerity but prepare to see dispelled
Any notion of my aptitude that you once held
Could fit what's felled through the button hole in my lapel
:
Slimmest sprout of a mic technique, clipped & cut
I'll try to reseed after I get dug out my rut...
Which could occur! In my fantasies, improve each night
Real life lags afterwards, perhaps out of spite
For its after-hours cousin so far favored by me
In the trajectory dream, eventually reign supreme
If I were better at rapping
You wouldn't need a napkin
Wadded up in your ear to keep out the noise
I make with my voice
If I were better at rapping
I wonder what would happen
Would everybody holler and cheer when I finished a verse?
Would they be sad to disperse?
Wish I'd started earlier. I'd be better by now
Maybe. Might have hit the pinnacle, I'd be settling down
But I'd settle a frown on my face at that conjecture;
To cultivate the vocal, the cadence and the texture
The lecture I give with it when I rap a rhyme
To such a top condition (graphed improvement over time)
Would indicate my origin at age negative nine
Even then, barely any better than already I'm
So! Unhinge the daydream door delve deep!
If I were better at rapping wouldn't people seek a peep
Or a full blown rooster report from the Front?
Kind of think that they might. My style's wack, let's be blunt
Let's lay it on the table: Frontalot could enhance
Rather drastically before you'd even hazard by stance
That I stand such a height above whence I done
Promise I'll get better at it if I can when it's spun",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-better-at-rapping-lyrics

They don’t stand in for love but they symbolize aptly
Grab a handful of blossoms as I pass by the crab tree
Hand these to the recipient of my affections
Urge they float in a crystal bowl (which I don’t provide). The misdirections
Of the close magic practitioner
Are like Bruce Wayne’s winking subterfuge with the commissioner

To convince you that the mints you had, fragility
Of wafer thinness established, were gourmet
Palmed though they were from the bulk bin at Safeway
Hey! You want better? You better want what you need
Not too much in excess of that lest you flaunt with your greed
“I want to be in love at any price.”
Who would seek a dozen roses when a posy would suffice?
I’ll read you poetry, I’ll tell you what I know to be true

Cheap-what?! Dirty word for such a generous soul
Who could lavish affection without any venerous goal
Or who, with such a goal in mind, could apprehend
Any climax in the offing so as not to precede a friend
And indeed the end of the world could be upon us:
It could be you and me blazingly enough to astonish
All onlookers with the glory of our passion
I know my sentimental earnestness is not so much in fashion
But I keep it ‘round the house; some day you’ll think it’s vintage
Instead of deeming it narcotic (as is Olive’s take on spinach)

All I ever gotta do is look her deep in the eyes
Open up the trap, let the romance flow
And mc frontalot has got her good to go
I come from the old school of the song fight where you must win
It wasn't polite back then to talk about what band who's in
Just get in the ring and it had better sound a little
Like you know how to sing
Or else what you wasting my time for?
I don't get like ""free internet""
My bandwidth's limited
I mean in steaddd of this, I could be fishing for pr0ns
With my dick out. all kinds of opportunities stick out
In my mind when I consider not clicking
This list of your lame ass eight times cause you're that tricky
And nobody knocks twice for these songs you tape
Except by mistake, and hit escape
Then again I love every single worthless last one of you
You're like a bottomless drain for my invective to funnel through
And you can call her every week, you won't win the heart
Songfight was frontalot's (when?) from the start
Now for the rest of you song fight types up long nights
Trying to get the solo right, hope somebody on the boards is nice
Holds your hand, says it's okay that front always wins
That your song isn't necessarily shallow and thin
Like one of the rest of you said in the review thread
Hoping to earn songfight's love and respect
Nevertheless, the actual fact of the situation
Songfight is stingier than I am, and she's patient
She waits when she has to for frontalot to come
Endures bunk songs that would knock many wooees numb
But not my songfight, she's ever vigilant
I stick my tongue in her butthole and wiggle it
Even though I call her up collect for phone sex
Mc front jumps the line, comes next
And all y'all with your big bouquets could wait out here
While I whisper sweet nothing rhymes
Up in her ear, never you fear songfight
I'm holding you dear",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-romantic-cheapskate-lyrics
Bad Nerd,"Net Split or, the Fathomless Heartbreak of Online Itself - EP",2018,"I remember back in the previous millennium
When, um, nerds were sighted, it was “Ready? Get ‘em!”
You’d hide it if you could, but none of us were able
Maybe congregate together and discuss the label
Maybe form a roundtable of the meek folk
Even chuckle at what we deemed an elite joke:
The elevation of our intellects and our low status
Intersecting in sadness. It was so bad, it was
Awful, I was there, I remember it
I was present at the founding of the syndicate
A pleasant moment of comradery
When we swore we’d shape the world to how it ought to be
We’d make everything perfect
Tempt the planet with heavenly circuits
Work it till we’re what the world is in need of
Thought there was only good nerds at the meet-up

You don’t need to be bad nerd, step away from the dark side
You don’t need to be bad nerd, you can muster some pride
You don’t need to be bad nerd, step away from the dark side
You don’t need to be bad nerd, you can muster some pride
You don’t have to be bad

Our conspiracy spread rapidly
None of the cool kids knew what was happening
A-list: Peter Jackson, Sam Raimi
Want your geek satisfactions? Pay Me
Make it free, then charge them when the bill comes
Yo, internet, where’d you get your skills from?
How’d you hide in every pocket
Every step of the way maintaining an open socket
Worming into their psyches
Giving them weird nerd urges however unlikely
Ever so slightly instilling
Nerd rage into the unwilling?
Bad nerds ascending with no ceiling
Kind of like we always did: the opposite of chilling
Cannot stand a slight, demands a killing
It’s bad for that to be fulfilling

You don’t need to be bad nerd, step away from the dark side
You don’t need to be bad nerd, you can muster some pride
You don’t need to be bad nerd, step away from the dark side
You don’t need to be bad nerd, you can muster some pride
You don’t have to be bad

Bad nerds, hacking the election and the top ten
Didn’t even stop then
Make ‘em gargle on your hot phlegm
Might even SWAT your friends. Show your raw contempt
For anyone who isn’t nerd at all
That’s when you lost the plot, you got enthralled
By power for its own sake
Up in my geekery tower, seeking my own break
From fucking getting hassled
Why you got to make nerd mean asshole?
Why you got to make internet cruel?
Turn part of it into a murderous idiot school
Turn the rest of it into paranoia fuel
Wreck the normies, they’re annoying you
But what you’re wrecking is the clique you represent
You don’t need to be bad. Ain’t too late to repent

You don’t need to be bad nerd, step away from the dark side
You don’t need to be bad nerd, you can muster some pride
You don’t need to be bad nerd, step away from the dark side
You don’t need to be bad nerd, you can muster some pride
You don’t have to be bad",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-bad-nerd-lyrics
Front the Most,Zero Day,2010.0,"MC Frontalot is not installed
So don't call 800-FRONT-4-ALL
I'm off the ball of wax to rock the rough tracks
Thumbtacks all up in the mix, so relax
You know I hax a beat together like a slasher rampage
MC Frontalot, inundated by the rhythm arrays
Some days I brag, some days I boast
24/7, I front the most

You wouldn't think that I would front
Most days, do nothing but
Sit around dropping the lyrics into the drum cuts
Buts, ands, ors? I hear naysay
Don't play! MC Front'll get offended, go away
Hey, there ain't no need to be real
Honk-honking on the sample like a trained m-seal
We all seek a second stepping from the post
24/7 I front, I front the most

What am I, wrecking every break beat?
That could take eight weeks
Only ever stop fronting to 
smoke bowls
, take leaks
And sleep. I catch a cat nap
Sit in front the mic so much that my ass chaps
Gaps : I was fronting in the other room
Boogalooing. Well, I wasn't, but I wanted to and
I'm going to rock the mic day and night till I give up the ghost

Anonymous animals eating fruit off the vine
And I mind when the vine fruit eaten is me
Disenfranchisement of Frontalot MC

Come and be skeptical, come and see spectacle
Bear witness to misdirects I expect to pull
As I get let full access to the war chest
I’ll afford you any outcome. Come on, shout some requests!
Like: Yea on the vote for: I get to count votes
Contract to me? Don’t you see shit floats?
And I hope I don’t break my back in the battening
Of hatches. Indicate a smattering of latches
Under oath, and we’re covered, it’s cool
Under those, exquisitely tooled
Patchwork of fail-safes and tamperproof seals
At which the hax0r kids scamper with zeal
But it still don’t matter who proves concept
Long bet against it getting to committee; non-threat
Give you any vote you want, never once get caught
At the election emporium of MC Frontalot

My black box, that’s what I used to vote with
Till I realized that I’m still a culprit
Well, let me explain, I’m hip to the game
Listen carefully, so you don’t get caught up the same
You see, I used to vote faithfully, but nowadays
I’d rather just wait and see, ‘cause these folks
Never cared about saving me: since slavery, look what they gave to me
Since way back when, check it out, we was all taught
In school that we could each make a difference
Now I realize that history is written by the winners
And it’s all just misrepresented
You cast your vote? How can you be sure
That the machines that you’re using are totally secure?
By television, books, even teachers at school
You’re better off playing the Lotto, ‘cause you’re
Gambling with your future if you choose to follow
So I’d rather sit at home with my hand on the bottle
Living for today, ‘cause I don’t care about tomorrow

Radical claptrap will bubble at the edges
Of the citizenry among the young and the restless
But the free and the young never battle for nothing;
They let me pickpocket votes, take the roads but they’re bluffing
And gone are the days, tombstones on the voter rolls
Now it’s all ports and diodes and nodes
And stickers and trucks and look, we’ve got it in hand
Go read the tinhatterati, you want a sinister plan
Just trust we deliver on the balloting day
You need deniability while you’re pretending to pray
And I’ve got to get to work ‘cause you’re ten points down
And I better be your co-chair—I built this town!
If you’re looking for a bargain on a way to prevail
Ohio and Florida are still on sale
But I’ve got to charge a lobbying fee for the service
'Cause folks want to vote and they’re making me nervous

People are incredibly cannibal some—indeed all—of the time

And I mind when the vine fruit eaten is me

Stumbled on back down two tabs in my hand
Chiseled little onna one it said ""don't be bad""
Onna other one written ""be as bad as ya like""
That one under the tongue and then I grapple the mic
Y'all better listen to me I bring commandments
First off y'all better make me a sandwich
Second up, God says I'm in charge
Word from on high: frontalot ought to live large
It's the dawn of the age of the mc front
Melt down that calf I'ma gild my butt
I'ma gild the mic, I'ma gild my tongue
Or I would if it hadn't already been done
Every god damn time that I get this high
Feel like I'm gonna hit my head on the sky
And I try to leave it alone but I can't
The mountain kind what they call the plant
Up top of mount olympus I was dissin' em all
Said, ya beats is short and ya words is tall
With ya molehill rappin, some gall you got
Made attempt to step to m. front a lot
I shot flares in the air zeus said don't do it
I'm messing with the old school now, and truant
Gone blue in the face, I drop bass
Drop rhymes so thick that they take up space
Um, ways and means to an end
I'm in need of a sherpa when I smoke this blend
Ascend, spark it up like the sun

To sage discussion among learned peers, about to find some here
Peruse a couple and the floor disappears
You get despised and disparaged. Is this normal? Let it go

As if anything could be wonderful enough to be unhateable

My confession’s intangible. Write it instead to memory
I hold myself to the highest ideals, yet I’m sometimes settling
I read them if they write them (I wil). Can’t always recommend it
I hope you don’t have a bad batch and you get upended
Hope you don’t vent it back at your dearest of dear-held intimates

Hop the chain-link to the abandoned Wienerschnitzel
What did I do to deserve this? What was my crime?
Was it because I sampled Die Toten Hosen that one time?
And I'm reviewing my life cowered under a grease trap
The boot slap stepping ever closer with its click-clack
Now he's here... now he's crouching down...
Jaws creak open, ants start pouring out
And just when as flesh is about to get devoured

On the internet, it's like everybody's always got their hackles up
""So many holes in your argument you need a spackle truck!
So many goals you've failed to meet with your rhetoric!""
Hush up your feuding for a second, Front'll settle it
You ought to bet a bottom dollar if you got one: freedom's hard fought
Folks prefer at least the amount that they caught
Hold of already
Ask 'em, they definitely don't want to relinquish any
Ask 'em for a penny, gratis, get turned down
Ask 'em for a free lunch, get called ass clown
But ask for an opinion, proposition turnt 'round:
Certainly you'll have mine (I would even ask how
You'd hope to avoid it, free as I feel to divulge one)

You're posting computer code's supposed to be free
They'll dispute it, go ""What's freedom even mean?""

But I'm more or less beyond the fear
Now the response is clear:
Use your conscience here, as well as your self-interest
Keep your potential seditions well witnessed
Or just complaints you like to make about the state
At the moment you're great. You post 'em up for debate
Post 'em up for agreement among a secret cabal of your peers
Be certain while the freedom train is rolling, all of you steer
Give wide berth to closed-source security
Anything you can't audit and reproduce thoroughly
Squirrelly EULA that governs your posts, don't it?
Free code's ironically only way you can own it
And keep it displayed until it echoes in the public domain
Pull down capitalism till it's rubble and chain
Since a way to get pwned is all it became
If you're having a freedom, I'll have double the same

Lil' Lisa?
Yeah?
Do you ever struggle with the dichotomy between your divine self and your base self, while you're trying to get to sleep?
Yeah, I do
Every now and then, I feel a ping, I feel a divine ping, but then I think, then I second guess it, and then I burp
Do you wanna go to bed? Is it bedtime?
I don't know, do you have a blanket?
I do have a blanket, oh my god I can't believe I tried to put you to bed with no blanket
I'm not a very good baby sitter

No types prohibited
Get your load balanced
Then you distribute it
Upgrade your talents

Optimal, isn't it?
Nerdlife: you live in it
Nerdlife: you already dwell there
Frontalot is right beside you, thick glasses, no hair
I work a desk job, making rap songs for internet
I take my hacking with me in the off hours
Like I'm itinerant. Bindle stick, sack full of big noggin
Doesn't matter what I code in, keep it logged in
Got the sock puppet on Hacker News to back me up
I hack the traffic lights, traffic jams could fast erupt
I hack a game of checkers, move out of phase with the board
Hack reality, the rules are ignored
This is nerdlife, underscored by many aptitudes
I rap for you. Engineered my life like hackers do
And now I'm lead dev on rocking the mic

Hope it blows up and you fly

Small Data,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Got to listen to the data in the day to day...
Some data sets are easy to explore:
Direction of the elevator & its current floor;
Whether this kettle is whistling or not;
What I brought in my pocket -- but what about what I forgot?
That’s a little difficult. I wish I had a robot
To calibrate perception and result. There’s a whole lot
Involved. And I’ve got to make sense
Out of this array before the set decays:
The oxygen load of every red cell in the system;
Every single fanfiction ever written;
Every bit of space dust and its velocity
By the way, everything changes constantly
But I’m pretty dedicated. I’ll collect it all
Frontalot got a little optimism installed
Got it dialed to the wall, now I think I’m omniscient
Data-driven to decision, I’m on a mission
To take a listen to the interrelationships
Twixt every locus at which any datum sits

We’ll see how big it is: all in the details",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-small-data-lyrics
Rewind That Back,Handmade Demo,2005,"Oh no! the beat's so busted up
Like my lip, drinkin pedro out the rusted cup
Shredded it, embedded a sample that didn't fit
Tell me I'll regret it? yo, I already did
Sitting on the edge of a cliff, differentiating
Hating from loving something from nothing
I'm puffing on the ashes of long-lost friend I couldn't fend for
Nor foresee the end for, wouldn't bend for
I'ma lend more attention to her after the fact
When I'm really wishin' that I could rewind that back
Don't you ever wish you could rewind that back and take it over
Change up the hot for the cold or...
Don't you ever wish you could rewind that back and take it over
Trade a yes yes! for the no, sir
Switch up my style ahead of time?
What am I, your psychic pal dionne? severing everything
Telling 'em not to sing the song romanticizing regrets
When every epitaph's made up of epithets
Safe bet: someday you're gonna wish you done otherwise
Irritated some other guys, sank down in some other thighs
Sung somehow some more soothing lullabies, and I see
Tears are on the verge of overflow & so I flee
Cause MC front ain't never looked back
Everything I ever done was right on track
Fact of the matter, I will never be regrettin' something

I think that was not a good movie.

Wrong! It ruled. My new all-time favorite movie. Ever.

How could you possible think that?

Just awful.

It was a little effects-heavy, but a very smart script. Well acted. Plausible.

It was a preposterous film.

Abysmal.

It was asinine. It was... other big words for bad.

I want my fourteen bucks back.

Question and Answer Time,Zero Day,2010.0,"So, Mr Hodgman...

What?

Why does a mirror reverse left and right, but not up and down?

It's lazy. It could do it, it doesn't feel like it.

I understand.

Next question.

Why haven't bats been domesticated?

They have been. Bats throughout history have been trained to do simple tasks. They carried messages from England to the French resistance during World War II. That was very inefficient. Only one out of every 5,000 bats actually had a message from the English. And oftentimes the message would be destroyed when they poached the bats in butter.

Sure.

Yeah, so, yeah, bats have been domesticated, but they don't make particularly good pets. Due to the screeching. And they give you warts. You used to be able to order bats through the mail. In the backs of comic books. It was traumatic for a lot of kids. I mean, at first, you'd get a package of freeze-dried bats in the mail and you're excited.

Sure.

But then when you attempt to rehydrate them... Yeah, not a very good toy. Next question.

What is the luckiest plant?

This is like what you call in the rapping world ""freestyling"" isn't it?

We are, we are freestyling.

I am not a rapper. I will just do the best I can, to answer your questions as usefully as possible.

Just honestly and completely, that's all I ask.

Exactly. Um, wheatgrass?

Lucky as the wheatgrass grows?

Lucky as the wheatgrass grows. I know people say that all the time. I don't know what it means.

Of the enduring philosophical questions. Which is the most deserving of continued attention and which is the least?

That one. And the least, ""What time is it?"" Because it's very simply answered.

It is.

It barely counts as a philosophical question.

It's kind of amazing...

But still, it sneaks in there.

It's incredible that it's still up for debate. It's asked dozens of times a day.

Yeah, it's like people are still searching for the answer.

Yeah.

Look at a watch!",https://genius.com/Mc-frontalot-question-and-answer-time-annotated
Fresh Dog,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo!
I got a little dog, the doggy's name is Doggy Fresh
And out of every single dog I've ever met, he's the best
And the rest of the dogs in the world, I wouldn't own 'em
Yo, my moms tried to clone him. I got sewn in
His skin a little microchip
So he could be a cyborg. Wanna get him equipped
With a GPS and the 802.11b
So he could hit me up on IRC when he got to go out and pee
And not just stand by the door and whine
Wish he'd grow an opposable thumb sometimes
Yo, but I don't mind. It gets me out and about
It's good to walk around the block, remind the dog he ain't allowed
To eat no street chicken, and chase no squirrels
Just to keep on kicking with a tail that curls
Just to keep on fancy stepping with the ears that flop
Just to rock. Yes, Doggy Fresh, you don't stop
(Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?)
I got a little dog the doggy's name is Doggy Fresh
And he be crazy charismatic like David Koresh
You can try to stay pissed about the fur on your clothes
But look out, you 'bout to giggle when he lick on your nose
Call and he shows up fast. He throws up grass
If you got a nice carpet he be dragging his ass
And he don't like baths, and he barks at intruders
He be begging where the food is like his owner was the cruelest
Non-dog-food-purchasing dog owner ever;
He occasionally ekes out a treat through this endeavor
But you got to forgive him with his big brown eyes
You got to go on to admit my dog's incredibly fly
He 'bout as fierce as a wolf, 'bout as big as a fox
If he drops one beat I'ma knock 'em out the box
Yo your cat's name may be Maceo

Rhyme of the Nibelung,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I got invited to go see The Ring; I thought it
Were probably a musical aboot hobbits
Started out promisingly enough:
Little fellow running ‘round and there was trees & stuff
And a shelter from a storm, and a girl it seems
Though the dialogue don’t make no sense to me
And her husband come out, he look a little menacing
Says he gonna eat you like a little piece of venison
When it’s um... morning I guess? I’m confused
Does the wife know the hero? There seems to be clues
There’s a sword in a tree. Why’s a tree in the house?
Did she slip her man a mickey? How come Siggy don’t get aus?
How come neither of ‘em making for the hills right now?
As for brothers loving sisters, isn’t this disallowed?
Isn’t this kinda how bad fates come about?
I’m gonna need an intermission just to figure it out
How here comes poppa, he’s the one-eyed jack
(Brünnhilde is the daughter with the armor on her rack.)
Does he lack in discretion? He backs up quick
Daddy Wo don’t ever seem to step to Ma Frick
She got him by the thick of the beard, she’s insistent;
But the subtitles flickered and I missed it
Odin doesn’t get to get his son killing dragons?
(Still sounds like a job for the elder Baggins.)
He can’t even incite his daughter to fix fights?
I’m about to go to sleep in my seat, alright?
‘cause the music’s hella stupid it don’t got no beats
And that’s the 22nd time I heard the leitmotif
And I cite no grief but opera ain’t for me;
It’s for the kinda people yo who listen to the CBC
And sip on tea, and read up on the paper
Another intermission coming: I’m gonna be the great escaper...
Sneaking out the lobby, I got ushed by an usher
Showed me to my row and he reminded me to hush up
I settled in waiting for the boredom to commence
Definitely unprepared for what’s next
When the strings set in and the horns come chasing
It’s kind of like I just got rewarded for my patience
This is more like it. This I could keep:
Ladies in helmets who ride eight deep
Grooving down in the seat, I’m rocking & squirming
Even almost got over the fact that they’re talking in German
I’m learning I might even have to come back
Wonder if they sell a ticket for just the third act?
Asked on the way out, did I follow? I say, “sort of
And I gotta say I’m glad it weren’t the Rings that there’s a Lord of

Washed away clean, set out to ocean

In mainlands, mountains, and landlocked states

Ever gleeful as a tree-full of dry leaf falls down

All the people that my government tortures, it ain't rumors

Count it lucky that the fatty pay the bill on time;
Soon as internet go down, you're all in misery. Why?
Cause you love to believe in the two-tone cat
There's an army of you out there answering back
There's a seven digit number, count it up from that
Dust mote, you get bat. tell him where the tuna at

Words that share a definition

That people say the same thing in the same way
Time after time, day after day
Over and over, repeatedly
When they got all these synonyms that are free to be
Employed, applied and utilized
Implemented and exercised?
What do we need so many words for, anyway?
Wait! Don’t escape, run off, or make a getaway
‘Cause the more words you got, yo the better you talk
Yo the finer your speech, all the easier to unlock

In a big machine, up the belt: goodbye!
Got to get it very wet because it’s very dry
Got to mush it, mash it, make it into slurry
Hurry! Can’t rest when a mess is occurring!
Tidy it up, wring it out, press it flat
Wind it up like that
Into the thing called the master roll
And that’s what we take home, right? No!
That one’s way too big for us
As if going to the bathroom wasn’t quite complicated enough
Don’t want to add to that
A toilet roll bigger than a Cadillac
That’d be sad. We couldn’t lift it up!
If the roll ran out, would we hire a truck?
A one-prong forklift, just the thing
Back it up, now bring. Get it into the swing
Of the mechanism. Yeah, it’s rolling now
Like generously doling out
Yard after yard of the bath tissue
To the benefit of skinny little cardboard tubes
Uh oh! They’re naked! Better get them dressed
Where do you expect they’ll roll to next?
Are they headed directly to the grocery store?
What are they still in the factory for?
Not too heavy any more, that’s true
But still too long to fit in the bathroom
So we measure them out and we cut them to size
Till they look like the rolls that we recognize
See how they ride down the line with ease
