Tek: Yo!  Check this out.  Smif-N-Wessun in the joint one time.  Putting you punks to this newness.  In ’94, you know what I’m saying?  Lock your doors.  Nobody’s safe, you know what I’m saying?  Check it out.  Haha
Steele: Ha.  Once again.  Yeah, yeah.  Recognize.  Real heads on the rise.  Haha.  Yeah

I walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side
No fronting, just in case I gotta smoke something
‘Round here, heads don’t act their age
You might be another dead bwoy upon page
Enter the cipher with your lighter
L’s are ready, prepare for another all-nighter
But keep a watch for the cops ‘cause they rock Glocks
Coming on the block, trying to rock knots
Pigs be acting like they’re bigger than us niggas from the streets
‘Cause we stalk mad deep and them walk beats
I guess them hold a grudge ‘cause I won’t budge
Playing tough, staring down the judge with my hands cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear
Au revoir, yeah, now I’m up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it because I’m brown or is it because I’m from Bucktown?

Kill you, batty boy, and hold your lover for hostage

On a violator that was sent out to get me
I’m tore up from the floor up, and everything’s Black, but, Steele/still
I’m on-point, ready to Buck, ain’t nothing sweet, Jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love, love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to my dick above
Don’t sweat the bulge coming from my hip
Grip once you get hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark

“We are the winning champion sound.  You cannot cross the border ‘cause we alkaline body.  You will come, we’ll kill you already and you and your fronting ass.  There is no form of threat to we come.  When it come to lyrics, we have it, so come!”

Boom bye bye in a batty bwoy head
The shottie fly, now the batty guy lie dead
Two shots dead to him chin.  Enemy or friend
Fake the funk, I put the junk to an end
Now who the rude bwoy wan’ come test Dog?
I find his family to I.D. him in the morgue
I bet you never thought I bust lead—surprise!
I’m a fortified blunt head just like me dread

You try test
The champion sound, you getting bucked down
Recognize the Boot Camp Clik out of Bucktown
Gun-thirsty little bastard, always blasted
From the sacks of chocolate off Mother Gaston
You say you number one wicked selector
I say you punnany and I’ll wet ya
Keep the bull ‘fore I pull this here trigger
‘Cause you don’t wanna test me when I’m tipsy off the liquor like the punk
They called McGirt.  Got his feelings hurt
Showed his true colors, had to yank up his skirt.  Now he’s
In misery, trying to cop a plea
Lead to him head from Gunn Clappa Numba Three, see
Lick off a shot, you no dick-rider
Lick a shot, punnany, not gunfire

Now
Everybody wanna be Don Gorgon.  All around
New York, niggas be talking, but we be stalking
In the dark’s when the gun starts barking
But in the day, be wary of where you be walking

“Don’t!  Don’t!  Don’t you ever mention ‘bout you wan’ test the champion sound!  Leave it to the people rough kind!  You know that we’re kind to people.  Them come-a, we never fall far.  Leave!”

Me nah
Sex, me rough like the wicked youth in me
That motherfucker that be bugging off of truth he see
Original criminal running town
Crime pays—that’s what I practice, so act if
You wan’ get blasted by my nine shot
Come around my block, find a nice spot in a pine box
Murderer, batty bwoy killer
Colin Powell feeler, we ‘bout to get iller

Sound bwoy, you got ‘nough reason to worry
Coming with my troops, we about to bury
Better pack your dubs and move in a hurry
Ease off, seen?
Looking at my pager, it’s about that time
To load up the nine and do my daily crime
Warriors, conquerors, the man before ya
Mr. Rippa AKA the enemy killer
My man with the weed is my man indeed, and all you
Sucky-ducky niggas catch knots with speed

“Talking ‘bout you have sound?!?  And my sound you wan’ test?!?  You’ll never know that, when it come to championship, it’s we that of the management that current spasmic on you, the fake-funking crew!  Leave!”

Lord, some bwoy gwan get dead tonight, duke
As I retrieve the two-five from my Timb boots
Target ‘pon sight, trigger ‘pon cock
Adjust your pupils to see a dead bwoy walk
‘Nough pussyhole gwan die this year
Here comes the Boot Camp sliding to the rear

Starang coming like a hurricane licking shots
More untouchable than niggas with the chickenpox
So emcees get lifted when I’m spliffted
Nigga, guard your grill ‘cause Louieville packs the biscuit
In the session, Smif-N-Wessun, O.G.C
Gunn Clappa Numba One with my nigga D-O-G

We bring
The realness.  Feel this boom as Black Moon
Reveal this.  We come to let you know what the deal is
Straight up, we serve justice, so if
You can’t be trusted, may you return where the dust is

“There is many sound that’s going around and going around, going like a clown, but I’m telling you.  Clean up your walk and come to the lights.  Sucker, you are dead, stuck from morning and always evening ‘til everything’s dead”",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-sound-bwoy-bureill-lyrics
Stand Strong,Dah Shinin’,1995.0,"Smif-N-Wessun - “Stand Strong”



I walk around town with the pound strapped down
That’s only because it’s mad real in Bucktown
It gets mad deep in the streets when you gotta
Watch your back for beasts, enemies, even your peeps
I step to my business, stand strong on my own two
Do what I have to do to get through
If you’re for real, then you know the deal.  I do or die
And I never ran, never will

Daybreak sneaks upon my camp once more
Niggas drowning in blackness, stretched on the floor
Breakfast is served, the killer dealer from the Stuy
All bwoy go heaven, but no bwoy wan’ die
Watch the thin line of rap and reality
Get yourself hurt, even cause fatal casualties
See, let me explain: this ain’t no game
The words you talk’ll have you coming right up out your frame
You understand where I’m coming from, slim
Bucktown’s the state of mind that I’m trapped in. If you
Wanna see me, have some sensi
Keep your actions real, everything’ll be irie
Wicked-minded youth, dem’ll lick off a shot
‘Cause the roots spilling ‘round my way to get hot.  Had to
Relocate, update with my inner
Build and destroy when I step in the center of
The cipher in the night, wool rolled tight
Boot Camp Click—no doubt, that’s right.  Now you’re
Singing a sad hymn, asking me to stop them
From throwing away your sloppy, double-chinneded husband
Mr. Rippa, I got lyrics out the Timbs
Hurt their pride so bad, make you never talk again.  And you
Called yourself a man.  I cram to understand
Never step into your business ‘less you got a clan

I walk around town with the pound strapped down
That’s only because it’s mad real in Bucktown
It gets mad deep in the streets when you gotta
Watch your back for beasts, enemies, even your peeps
I step to my business, stand strong on my own two
Do what I have to do to get through
If you’re for real, then you know the deal.  I do or die
And I never ran, never will

When I come around
The block, I give mad love to the heads that I know
While the heads that I don’t know watch.  As I
Step to my business, they witness me
Constantly building with my family
Jealousy makes them enemies, so when them
Not step correct, me and my Tek’ll put an end to the
Individuals who choose to use life for granted
What you gwan do when it’s demanded?
Will your boys leave you stranded in the midst of a battle?
Will you get that ass shattered at your own risk?
I hope y’all niggas get it right this time ‘cause in this
Life of mine, I’m going out for crime, and I believe
You got to take what you want to achieve
Some do have tricks up them sleeves
But we crack down on the wack found back ‘round
Bucktown, get down if you’re with the now
‘Cause what’s happening?  There’s a whole lot of flapping
But watch what’ll happen when we bring Gunn Clappaz in
Boot Camp organize in the streets
In the industry, on the rise with my peeps, but don’t
Sleep ‘cause you’ll only manage to gain a mental block
On your brain or a Glock to your frame
Basic training, Boot Camp don’t let shit slide
So we be ready for what be on the brick side

I walk around town with my pound strapped down
That’s only because it’s mad real in Bucktown
It gets mad deep in the streets when you gotta watch
Your back for the beasts, enemies, even your peeps
I step to my business, stand strong on my own two
Do what I have to do to get through
If you’re for real, then you know the deal.  I do or die
And I never ran, never will

You’re too light to fight, plus you’re too thin to win
And who you gonna call when I break your glass chin?
Mista Rippa slicker than your sister
Turn down the lights, she got hit by the Vicksta
Keep a lid on your lip so your wig won’t get split
Better have your joint cocked, my hand’s coming off my hip
This little nigga pumped the lead, that ass fled
Three of your boys wounded, three of your men dead
Time to hop the iron 
hilly
, get back to my
Spilly
, flatfoot coming deep like 
hillbillies
Can’t hear the sirens, gotta block ‘em out my mind
I gotta get away so I can do more crime
See my brethren down the block, rising up out their spot
Puffing meth in the hood where the spot is hot
My Timbs ease tension by stomping necks when I’m vexed
Throw up your dick-beaters, kid, it’s time to flex

Hit the Benz, then hit the spliff with my friends and
Catch mad wreck with my man Tek.  
I am what

I don’t front for you, your crew, even a stunt
Roll up the blunts ‘cause real niggas do what they want
Big up to all original criminals

I be getting charged with my squad on the
Project step, and you’ll regret when my mob flex
Glam to the man that sham when

Collect your trap, then add it to my fat stack
Chill, I’ll be back.  Right now, I’m out to smoke the next sack

Trespassed in Bucktown, and now you’re all mine

Sitting on the toilet, shitting, puffing the dough
Strobe light effect, everything’s moving slow
Slip into a deep zone, the sound of the phone bring me home
Stagger to my feet and motion toward the phone
Ayyo, Rippa, what up, nigga?  Check out this proposition
There’s money to bait, and I’m in the mood to go fishing
Whatever, nigga.  Give me time to wash my ass
My hand been itching all day, fiending for the cash.  
Do what you
Gotta do ‘cause I’m on my way in the car
‘Cause when I get there, yo, we audi like tomorrow
.  Right
Right, easy.  
Now I’m off to the south
To get more info on this dough I heard about
Gotta make sure everything’s secure, can’t
Let me and my man let these Grants slip past our hands
The man’s out heavy today
I hope they don’t try to get in the way of our pay
Damn.  Already high noon, the man’s out
Gotta take a quick shower, get dressed, and bounce
Grabbed the fatigues, strapped on the generals
Proper attire for all criminals
Blazed up the clip, loads up the four-fifth
If a bwoy riff, leave a body, dem stiff
Who the man there gwan rap ‘pon my door?
Disturb me at work.  Only loaded up four.  
Ayyo
It’s me
.  Who that?  
S-T.  What up, G?
Aight, hold up, son.  Let me put it back on safety
Ayyo, kid, it smells like fresh grown cess
Let’s twist up some trees ‘fore we jet
True.  You know we keep a fat sack of sensi
Even though you know it make our pockets go empty
Well, all that’s about to be solved in a few minutes
So whenever we finish, we gon’ bag up this spinach
Easier said than done.  Peep the 4-1-1
The dread around the corner just tried to blast Ruck and dun
I knew it.  Bad vibes flowing like fluid
Forget about the dough.  Let’s do this
I see you already strapped, pa
So I’ll meet you outside ‘cause my gat’s back in the car
How far must one go before I throw
His whole entire life right out the window

What you say, fly?  
Thinking out loud just caught me in the zone

Whatever.  I’ma send this nigga to his essence

Even though some I used to run with and smoke blunts with
Fuck the foreplay.  Let’s do shit the raw way
Kill the “he say, she say.”  Check what we say

You let info slip out, so it’s dead you get
There’s the Black Moon, we creeping up in your room
Death fills the air along with the scent of boom
Open your eyes, motherfuckers, and greet your fear
Off with the head of a snitch, and he’s outta here

Can’t wait to get that bus heading upstate
New place, same faces from the last joint
Got my banger, so when danger come, I’ll be on point
In the parallel cell, mad niggas flip
‘Cause some big bear doing dip just got his ass ripped
Juveniles buck wild in this vicinity
Keep an open eye ‘cause now I sleep with the enemy
Ready to thump with any chump with ideas
Nobody move, nobody gets blown from ears to rear

Thinking of a way to get even with my P.O
‘Cause I know the bitch dicked a nigga on the D-Low
Now behind bars where scars come in pairs
Trooping with my blowers ‘case them niggas try to bring it here
Flipping on the bitch ass who got cash
And commissary ‘cause I ain’t going home ‘til Nevuary
Another straight-out “no” coming from the board
Keep my anger hidden ‘til I’m back up in the ward
Niggas know what’s the word ‘cause the grill is blank
Once again, it’s on.  Sucker-type, grab your shanks

I got one in store for hardcore fanatics
Banging from basement to attic for static if you got dramatics
Who’s the next up for heads up?  When my lead’s
Used up, I’ll get my baseball bat, and you’ll get bruised up

Word
Life, my semi-automatic end statics.  Smoking lye’s
More than a habit, and our victims die tragic
We stalk around like the beast out for prey
Packing the ammo, pulling more juks by the day, taking
Loot with my crimeys, on the run from the coppers
Boot Camp’s on the map, and ain’t no way that you can stop us

Get out
My way, nigga.  I’m coming through deep, and my fleet
Packs heat.  Ain’t nothing sweet, we play for keeps.  I got
Money on my mind and my hand on my nine
Gots to get mine ‘cause my life’s on the line.  I
Roll with the Rippa, and the Rippa rolls with me
And my bred-dread D-to-the-O-G

See?
We be hitting up boom spots a lot
In the cypher, getting high with the hoods on the block
If you don’t know we, don’t even come in our circle
Fuck around and get me vexed and I’ma hurt you
Bumba clot rudeboy, lick off your nine
As we hit you one time for you fucking mind

A Dog like Tim—that’s why you’re scared to “Step to Me.”  Do we
Have to result in fisticuffs?  See, I get
Swift with my stuff—that’s when the Ruck erupts

Run with Heltah Skeltah through the realms of the dark
If a nigga rift, then I’ma let the four-four bark
Everybody knows, when my knotty head grows, I turn
Into a lethal weapon and start stepping on toes
I waste no time when I move mine
Grab my Glock and then I clear the block like I was PO-9

Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp surviving to freak you, and
Fuck with my Bucktown group
And in the night, night, who rolls tight?
Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp surviving to freak you, and
Coming through, representing Boot Camp Clik
In the night, who roll tight?

I fears no fears, and that’s word to my dry tear

Feel the wrath as the Gunn Clappaz clap that ass.  One
Time for your mind, hit that ass colorblind
Signed on the dotted line is how I live my lifetime
Reality hit me at some degrees, now my
Eyes bleed (Why?) because I just smoked a bag of weed

Bringing forth
Heltah Skeltah be the big Rock, God help ya
I beats more ass than mom dukes’ leather belt, I gets
Open like doors when I be trooping, trademark
Be booting, baggy pants drooping, hooping and
Hollering.  Nigga, shut your mug ‘cause I might have you
Swallowing a whole bunch of slugs ‘cause I’m bugged in my
Dome piece, roam in the streets with my chrome, I’ma
Blast it, my Camp’s magic, I get that ass quick

‘Nough men a die, ‘nough men a come try
To test the warrior I, me no know why
A new breed of conquerors is on the rise
Step to my Boot Camp and catch black eyes from the
Heltah Skeltah, the Gunn, the Clappaz, Smif-N-Wessun
Coming through, stomping out all you wack rappers with
The crazy dread.  The mad boy head’s fed of corny
Shit that’s said, so now you bleed like your man bled
We’re getting twisted as our Timbs cover pavement
Flowing state-to-state, picking up the next payment
Your thoughts smell.  Violators to the left, four
Slugs hit ‘em chest, no more, no less
So think about it, abort your mission—it’s impossible
Or be a vegetable, laying bent up in the hospital
You silly wabbit, tricks are for kids—don’t you know that?
Fuck with my Boot Camp and get your wig pushed back

Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp surviving to freak you, and
Coming through, representing Boot Camp
Industry we break down

I be that
Rude boy, bad boy, coming from the ‘Ville
Step to the Boot Camp, somebody get killed by me
The T-O-P D-O-G
Or my nigga Mr. S-T-R-A-N-G
Some of y’all niggas be trying to pull the trigger
But I figure I could bust that ass just a little quicker
Time to catch wreck, get back to the set
Where all generals, them call “Timb Chek”

All up in your motherfucking grill, I be Steele, coming
Through with my wrecking crew, so I reckon you keep it real
If not, I’m blowing spots on whoever be showing Glocks
And whatnots, walking around, faking mad rocks
The only Rock I know is B.I.G. breaking up
N-I-double G-As with that nigga R-U-C-K
Better be ready to be jetty if you’re petty ‘cause if
It wasn’t already said, we’re dangerous and deadly
You better recognize or recollect.  I wreck a set
With a Tek, and we ain’t asking, we blasting
Now, from this, you may think that Steele is trife
I earn my stripes ‘cause I deal with the real in life
And I reveal my knife to cut you loose.  I’m not
Ruthless, but you’ll get the boots if you useless
‘Cause, time upon time, I find
If you remain blind, you get left behind
But we see very clearly
So step up to the front ‘cause this is where we
Represent on the lovely for you
And give praise due to the Father above me
‘Cause we ain’t here to attack all, but we’ll
Take the backs off the wack rappers that jack off
That’s all, that’s it, strictly the
Bumping shit.  Niggas don’t even know what they fucking with

Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp surviving to freak you
Fuck with my Bucktown group
And in the night, night, who rolls tight?
Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp surviving to freak you
Fuck with my Bucktown group
And in the night, night, who rolls tight?
Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?
Boot Camp surviving to freak you
Fuck with my Bucktown group
And in the night, night, who rolls tight?
Why you wanna fuck with my Boot Camp?

Tek: So let me hear this first
Steele: Aight
Tek: Kick that shit
Steele: Yo

Before I go to bed, I take an L to the head
Reminisce over words that was once said by my man
God rest his soul, I was told, “Stand bold
When under pressure, don’t fold”
To my brother, my nigga Rambo, you know we love ya
I wish you was around to see us rip through the underground
Smif-N-Wessun dedicates this to my man
Sean Grady, the R.  One love, baby pa

Yeah, yeah, haha, for real

Grab a hold of your heart and visualize as I kick it
A hollow-point slug coming out a black biscuit
You inches from death, we ‘round the corner, coming quick
We meth’d out our minds and just don’t give a shit
Goddamn it, gun shots we bust from the clip
Wicked bad boy, stash the burner on my hip, so
Fill your oaths and get dead, Mr. Buster
‘Cause we ain’t got love for none of y’all motherfuckers
Chief the black bar, hard to do a ride-by
You’re too leery to live, but you nah wan’ die
All these emcees with your fancy names and gangs

Big up to all the real heads with the knuckle game.  Rest in peace

Realize what’s before your eyes, then
See if you see the same real as we.  When

Nothing alive or in dreams could ever come between

From the heart of where it all started: Bucktown.  Boot Camp
Representing for all the dearly departed
Next, we coming to speak to the real emcees
‘Cause the weak emcees blow in the breeze

Running with the Boot Camp on the search for the enemy
And if he happens to be amongst we
Fuck this.  We bring him to court and serve justice

See, me and my Clik got a thing going on
True to the game, and the love makes us strong
For everyday trials and tribulations
You try to stop us, get rocked by a nation
See my forefront of soldiers ready to blow ya
Leave your back broke and your body slumped over
The war is on, and the stakes is getting high
You kill a man dead if him shit where him lie
It’s the code of the streets when you’re out with your peeps
Bumping on the beat, be on-point for the sweeps
Pigs harass that ass for the drug cash
Armageddon soon come—keep the gun stashed
But in the meanwhile, sess ease the stress
Taking gunshots through the nose to the chest
Bless the sensi that get me irie
And all praises due to the Almighty

What up?  I heard that you got a little prob’ with
The way that we roll and the heads we done robbed
Sticking and flicking the bangers, throwing them out to your neck
Another beat-down inflicted by that nigga Tek
And for you backstabbers, yeah, I got a sharp dagger
And a left hook that’ll cause your jaw bone to shatter
Who’s skilled enough to come test the weeded two
Titans from Bucktown that’ll burn through your crew?
I got a vibe from the session in the back.  When niggas
Is strapped underground, puffing meth and kicking raps
Smif-N-Wessun coming with ‘nough buds and skunk
Fake the funk and get found dead in a trunk

All heads realize, wrekonize

Back again, make room for the boom
Puffing the lye, getting high to a Beatminerz tune
Stroke my gat ‘cause where I lives at’s a lot of rats
Cool champagne is my brain, so I don’t sweat that
Instead, I mack with a Tek and a Dog, my man
Ruckus and Rock.  Ayyo, Rippa, what up, ock?

The deal’s going down like this: run off at
The mouth, watch your lips and my boots do a French kiss
Putting an end to those who tend to get me aggravated
I’m tired of counting dues and adding up the years we waited
Be on the lookout for these mad blunts smoking
Keep your girl away from me ‘cause I won’t hesitate to stroke it

Plant, but I can’t lamp ‘cause niggas get me amped
Talking this and that, but my rap format’s fat
And I slap cats that commence to stab backs
Never could I ever agree on cutting loose
A lot of my troops that I rolled with for eons
Be on your tippy-top or you’ll quickly drop by them
Crooked cops or the local cock-blockers on your block
I watch my back when for delf
Some say the buzz, but I say the fuzz bad for my health
Huh!  Critics could get banged like Riddick Bowe
First, I get lifted with my Clik before ripping a show
So I say what I mean
Mean what I say, do what I do, and me not play
Say, “En garde,” for punks who play hard.  Don’t be
Surprised I’m pulling your card.  You better wrekonize

It's Tony Toca, the one that's got you screamin ""En esa loca""
Dale huevo Is my mic Leggo my Eggo
Spanish Harlem all the way to San Diego
Make it happen
You know, like movin yayo
I set my product, that shit's far from the palace
Mantequilla not manteca o sin semilla
Cocoa brovaz, hurricane, mira mira
Ton touch sound doofy eatin fajitas
Chillin in the b-boy stance
In my Adidas
While señoritas be screaming Buenos Días
Rock steady by now you know the steelo
Mi corrillo still gets down on the leelo
Soy taino indians welcome to my tipi
Pop in the CD and let's get freaky
Melaza, Guatauba en la casa
Boricua, about to pass it off to the rasta

It's the el generalno
Tell your baqua where's the hydro
If the chocolito make my eyes low
BC a tomb bab with me and my man
Trying to double our ends with the el capitan
(speaking Spanish)
(speaking Spanish)
Undressin me, thinking about sexin me
Wanna matarme a mí?

Blazing, kicking lingo with this bingo
Who got hot making the pesos out in Santo Domingo
El socio, used to go to the Acapulco
Every weekend tricking on chulas, he was beatin
But on the streets of harlem around the grand concourse
He had to force a loco, with amigos he used to boss
Ay Dios mio, just like el niños
El corazón de el está frío
Y puro como perico

Harlem got the pace in it (boogie, boogie got the cake in it)
Crooklyn keeps on takin it (queens cats been making it)

I do this for my soldiers in the streets
Who stand toast to toast with the cousin asleep
Making illegal transactions
World-wide connections
Forced up a change like the name smif-n-wessun
See me coming through and my nigga clef too
Or the 650 blowing up the Grant's Tomb
Mobb beats to protect slaying your street bite
Like a killing, over-dealing for the pearly white

Blowin' down your mother fucking roof
It be hurricane g, subwoofin out ya ass
From first staff, up through parks from the heart
Representando! and my niggas up in spanish harlem
Who don't give a fuck and my box stuck cutting up tribal
So get the hydro, cause we gonna keep it live all night yo
Yeah one love to my fam in boricua land
My hermanitos sparking up trees
112 buddah keys barking up puerto rican crib
Smacking all rice and beans
And you know my hermanitas keep it real
In timboso high hills
All my pitycitas who ain't fucking around
Santeras holdin shit down for the crown
Tony touch, cocoa brovaz and I
Keep the barrio high
No doubt
If he CPR in the mother fucking house
I'm talking about crazy puerto ricans
Who beefing
A few heads is busted because I see them leaking
Freaking, because I be frying bitches up like hoochie fritos
For my ""papi chulitos""

Yo, yeah word up and if you can't get wit it then kiss my culito
But you, on thea real I wanna say one love and rest in peace
To my nigga Bridge from 112
Big up Johnson Projects
Jefferson in the house
An the whole spanish harlem
Word up one love to the barrio, cocoa brovaz, tony touch and hurricane g
Peace de corazón papi

Make this money, niggas hold up guns
Armed full of licks, plus your dick, drop your ones
Baby need new shoes and a outfit
I see you stick-up kids, you came wit the dick lick
You see my set of twin-hitmen from Bushwick?
Two chicks wit the twenty-two tecs, bitch

Now open up the circle so the dice can breathe
Pay you double, if you triple, if you push you pay me

Gotta poly wit ya crew to stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up

If the tension's on your mind then raise the roof up
You gotta keep it in the fam, stack ya loot up

“Smif-N-Wessun, and we’re representing lovely”

Smif-N-Wessun out of Bucktown, starting mad trouble
Play the hardrock, we break your block down to rubble
Perform a construction, like a storm when we’re rushing
Raising Cain, hip shots graze your brain
It’s ripping down like thunder, pound, make a brother
Wonder, “Now, what other ill shit lies underground?”
We got more if you want more—dig it
But you got to be hardcore to get with it.  
As a youth
Some called me Tone, some called me Darrell
Now they call me Steele ‘cause I’m rough to the bone marrow
You don’t believe me, G?  Check my apparel
Dress code is bold, so feel the cold barrel
What up to all my cock strong troops in their boots
True to the game, staying true to their root
That’s how we choose to remain, plus we just can’t change
And we won’t change, still stay the same

“Representing Smif-N-Wessun”

Timbs and hood check, my crew’s out to catch wreck
Run in your crib, and bolt your doors’ll be your best bet
You hear footsteps approach as I drop the roach
Of the smoke, you can’t react because your throat is being choked
Pull your biscuit—that’s your ticket to escape
I got the trey-deuce, my crime partner got the trey-eight
I kick it hardcore, so these critics try to ban me
But I’m getting busy like the Black Guerilla Family
Gotta meet my man at a quarter to nine
So we could blow this town and leave the corpse behind.  We ain’t
Many, but we crazy, shady, broke into a crib
What we did.  Yes, we smoked the fat lady

“Blaka!”  That’s my alarm clock a-shot
Emptied out the clip of a hooded kid’s Glock
Out on a mission for the green with his team
Twisting up buds, puffing on blunts I need
Always redeye with an evil, scheming mind
Pulling off things with his 
partners in crime,
 not
A care in the world, he’s seen plenty stiff bodies
Running up in spots with the calico and shotties
Lounging on his strip with his Timbs and his meth
His right-hands span on his side to the left
Never leave the joint without packing the burner
Got the street smarts, either kill or be murdered.  
It’s
No relaxing, just taxing
Stoned is the way of the walk when you’re black, and
Supporting habits is getting too hectic
Gotta kick it with my son about some old next shit

[Verse 2: Steele and

Pressures be building in my mind sometimes in ways
That have me counting the many reasons why crime pays
I think about the hustling games.  Should I maintain
Or flip and just shift to the fast lane?
We got a mob
, but it takes dough to make bread
(
Shit!
) We’re working with cement, trying to make bricks
Time to make a call and get on the ball
Can’t front, G, ‘cause we won’t be ones to take a fall
Heads recognize me, so they might supply me
But if they try me, that wouldn’t surprise me
But I and I keep eyes open for those who
Lie scoping me, hoping we won’t survive
Whatever
.  We can do this for worse or for better
Me and my 
Partner N Crime
 is going through this together
So, knowing we can’t avoid all snakes, we gon’ do
Whatever we gotta do to set this shit straight

And that’s
Word to my brethren madman.  Give the left hand
In response, say hello to my Timberland
Rack emcees up, and I’ll crack emcees up
Pass the owl so I can twist these trees up
Boot Camp Clik sick, so tie your loose lips
Snooze while me and my crew do some next shit


Big up original crooks from the side of the earth
Where you take all your stakes for what it’s worth
We represent the hearts of the criminalistic
Flip, bitch, prepare to draw your biscuit
Fucked up before?  Shit, let’s get with the now.  Is you
Down or is you just gon’ lamp in the background?
If so, let me know ‘cause I gotta keep
A steady flow, step to my biz like so when
I show individuals skills on the battlefield
Any man fi test, see, we out to kill
‘Cause each and every soldier holds the name
Of the Camp.  Duke, trip on this trail, get trampled
Another villain this clan just banned, dead
We take the band and wrap around the head of
An original dead boy down with the Devil

No more calmness.  From chest to chest, see who’s the strongest

The underground flavor is major.  I’ll check you
Later.  Gotta get with my peeps and get paper
No time for sleep, gotta hit the streets with my peeps
Get with Mr. Walt, tell him, “Hit us off with this phat beat”
Hit the sack, then rip a track back-to-back

We bringing drama to y’all wannabes.  Do me

Beef knocking
At my front door, time to face drama once more
Once and for all, settle the score.  I could feel
The heat from the hot concrete.  Cops walk the beats
But the crooks rule the streets.  Huh!  Come and mingle
In the cipher of a no-good hood, try to survive
Bucktown!  Boot Camp if you could!  The struggle’s no
Different and the pain’s all the same, all the same game
Just labeled with a different name.  When beef
Gets thick, I stick with my Boot Camp Clik, Mr. Rippa

Keep the vehicle, the God, and the physical
Move accordingly

I take a slug before they take my brother out
Bless and a curse, watch your mouth in my mother house

It’s a friend of me ‘cause we at war with the enemy (Let ‘em know)
We keep eyes out for spies out in our cipher
All men trife.  If I take a life, then I might die a lifer
Unless I control the stress
Ease off, roll off the set, get with Tek
Walk around again with Mr. Brown and his Jamaican friend
Never to sleep again unless I want my life to end

Go ‘head and
Rest, blood.  Let me take watch of the battlefield (Aight)

Drama that trace from me back to my momma, so to
Be a man, the plan is never to sit where I
Lay my head to rest at night unless my gun’s right
Under my pillow or right near me.  Nightmares
Don’t scare me, but what happens at night got me leery
So fear me ‘cause I’m like the ones that troops
With something in their midsection for protection
I reckon you take a second or two to recollect
For a few while I connect with my crew
And keep it moving and give rocks to bill, blocks
To seal dome, then big-up, corrupt cops to kill

Coward-ass niggas want beef with the ruckus in us
Pine box that ass and ship you back to your sender
It’s all about reality.  Now follow me
Into the thoughts of a high madman
Knuckles all swollen, blood dripping from my hands, kind of
Lost it for a sec ‘cause I snap now and then
Ever since the beast threw his Glock to my chin.  Now I’m
Living with the grudge for the fuzz, pulling off

Yo, it’s straight up for all the cannabis, sativa smokers out there in Bucktown, we’re doing like this.  Check it out

This is the story of a place that we call home
Where the kids pack heat when it’s time to roam
Everybody’s on a scramble, life’s a gamble
Hopping on the white horse, trying to get a handle
On the fast pace that we call the last race
Step with precaution when you enter this place
We got a spot on every block to make your dreams come true
Just come correct with the snaps is all you do
Don’t come crying broke, still trying to cop the dope
What parts of no do not you understand bro?
We can’t afford to take shorts or be playing sports
Empires need to be built, MAC-10s bought
Or even caught from them deceased-ass hustlers, and we
Still got the pound for y’all living motherfuckers
What goes around comes back to the roots
See you at the revolution in Crooklyn, troop

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We trying to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby

Another day, another dollar dead
Pigs rushing the crib to catch a collar, now I’m fed what I
Face now, me and my peoples taste ground, staying
Face-down while K-9 sniffs around.  
What they
Found was irrelevant to we ‘cause
They was sent to represent and cause a ruckus amongst us
Now I got more pigs rushing we, hand-
-cuffing me, taking hold of we into custody
For questioning ‘bout some boy resting in peace
After going through the bullshit, we get released
And hit the streets, where the war still on for all of y’all
‘Cause they kept Rule locked behind the wall
No time at all to fake no jax (No jax).  Perhaps when
The gat spin, niggas won’t even know what happened
I’ll be glad when my man come home, getting his own
Motherfuckers, grab your chron’

We live in Brooklyn, baby
We trying to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby
Our time is now

The eyes read time as lead treads spine
Currency change hands from yours to mine
Greenbacks talk, bullshit floats on water
Pager going off, call coming from headquarters
I was told if the secret code appears
It means some bwoy wan’ dead, prepare for warfare

Fuck the truce
We bringing the noose for your loose talk
So think smart or rest in parts if you do start
I fucks with the poor, so fuck being rich.  Word is bond
There’s a motherfucking war going on
Stand strong on your own two, mister
Or come confront the Grim Ripper
Black hoodie on, black dusty fatigues
Bloody red eyes from puffing on the black weeds (On creep)
He lurks in the shadow, so when you sleep in the battle
That’ll be a tale you won’t live to tattle

Salute to each and every hood, label, troop
Doing what you gotta do to bring in the loot
Huh, the time has come for Armageddion
Give nurture to your seeds and load up your guns, dun
I’m catching vibes that something ain’t right
Getting little hints, stomach’s feeling uptight
Damn, these little nappy-head, G-Train bastards
Running ‘round town with the chrons, tryna blast shit
Ain’t nothing sweet like the dark streets of Bed-Stuy
Creep through population, ending up in C.I

Take a ride through the Flatbush side, see the dread in
The court for support, hit we off with the lye.  Now
Slide through the ‘Ville, Seth Low
Say hello to the fam, then stick to K.I.M. as planned
Toward the east, something’s going on, 
so burn
The buds, and all my people in Medina stay strong

We trying to make it, baby
We gonna make it, baby
We live in Brooklyn, baby

And any one of these niggas could blow your grill
Show your skill - you want war? Hold your steel
You want more? Unload techs, you all could feel
Raw deal, you all peel, run for the hills
Run for your shields, the battlefield's blastin at will

Smoke Dawg you know my name I'll
Be the same til the day that I'm laid down
Niggas push me to the point's gotta spray rounds
Takin shit like for a game, actin like clowns - always playin
You ain't bustin off, just shootin the breeze
Cause you scared of the repercussion after we squeeze
You ain't been through what I did just to get where I'm at
Streets where I rep and B-K where I be at

Cause Brook-lyn where we live-at

I'mma Brooklyn survivor, these streets is hotter than lava
Top of saliva, burn you like fire
I'm a B.K.D.C.S.T. smokin Nestle with a chick in a G.S. Tree
Why Missy so sexy but she's a bitch
Chill shorty, who can't play me
I'm a general baby, what you crazy
Bucktown where niggas be actin so shady

Welcome to Crooklyn, where we send shots to ya fitted
Rock two tone doo rags and whips and kid it
I love to shit it, fuck you if you ain't wit it
Out here I know the D.A. get cases aquited
So why would I up and leave, behind all my team
All that cream, go to where new and start out clean
My sixteen, these niggas cramp with hoes
Been all around the word, still Brooklyn's own


What we live is what you read about
And any time of the day we bring the heaters out
My nigga stacked his dough, then he bought the Beemer out
Now you wonderin what Cocoa B's about?

Tired of coppin weed bags, had enough of those
Invest in a few pounds or a couple O's

On point for the B's and whenever beef approach
If you want me you can find me in the reefer smoke
Chrome close, anyone compete - meet your ghost

All my heights and capers, Smoky Lah be one of the greatest
Can't tell you all the things my niggas do for the papers
Why our Roc's look like Raiders and got models for ladies
Come through in fresh wears, always drivin Mercedes
Summer days and mountain bikes, wet Timbs on my feet
Move with the heat, Cocoa B's influence your speech
Four in a week, catch me in the park gettin scent
Federales stay all over the bar, behind the neck, out in

Jazz niggas, stop stressing Smif-N-Wessun
From the corners of my red eyes, I peeped you
But you don’t know ‘cause I rock my rag real low, move
Slow ‘cause you might get moved on, can’t even
Get my crews on without niggas putting their screws on
Shit ain’t cool son ‘cause soon, one day
I feel I’m gonna have to lay somebody for real
A deal is, but Steele is strictly business
So when dick-riders slide around, I dismiss shit

Don’t laugh though.  Stress’ll make a nigga hurt something
Precede to get some yard weed ‘cause the dread is pumping
And as I approach, I’m greeted by my cous’ Roach
“What up, ya high-ass nigga?  Yo, your shit’s the dope!”
And then he just K.I.M., Keep It Moving, damn
And now here comes the dick-riders screaming, “You the man”
Until I turn my back, bet they’re quick to grab the gat
The head dick-rider said, “I know where he live at”
See that’s what I’m talking.  Sucking dick while you’re walking
Now you’s the target of the Boot Camp stalk kids

Lick off a shot, you no cock-blocker
Lick off a shot, you no dick-rider

Pound for pound, lines of nines, round for round
Style profound, spark the loud, sound surround, (Wooooo)
How can I move the crowd?
First of all, no rats or snakes allowed!
The Larkin blaow, nobody body parts are found
Not near, not near nada talking foul, when gods around

That did me or Southstar you know tell y'all a little story

Love hate
Mistakes
Tell me what you think is going on
We date all day
All day
Tell me what you think is going on
Two late
Heart break
Tell me what you think is going on
Whats going on
Whats going on
And yo me and ms. thang
We were the perfect team
We had all the things all them other couples dreamed
Love, trust, good sex, and security
If you ever felt weak, smilez was your energy
Trips across seas
Showed you the finer things
No more burger king, it was fine dine cuisine
And if we never had it
I don't think it mattered
We were a class A like Nas and Illmatic
I was so deceived, I thought we had a thing
You used to blow my two way up with 1-4-3s
The l-o-v had me blind I wouldn't have seen
I trusted my friends, all they were yelling at me
How could you do me so wrong
I don't want get gone
I invested three years ma plus this song
I'm so confused
Where to go how do I choose
I guess to find real love
I got to pay my dues

It seemed so good
Yo we used to chill in the hood
You made me feel that tingle in
My heart like nobody could
And all along we stood
When times is hard
Even before all this rap shit made me a star
When I was working two jobs just to survive
When I felt like killing my self
You kept me alive
What a pair
Me and you we was a match
Different tastes but you know opposites attract
By my side, held my head and kept me strong
Still trying to figure out where the hell we went wrong
I did what I can young cat being a man
Stayed when ever the storm when most would have ran
Too much pride, and you know men don't cry
Had to let you go even though it hurt inside
All by myself, now I had to turn to these rhymes
It's the only way I know to release my mind

Its been a while
Yea you know time goes fast
Let me tell you though, some things still don't pass
Sit back in the pad think, about the times we had
Try not to let it make me sad or make me mad
I'm trying to move on with my life
The wound is healed
Yea I'm just speaking it real, I'm ready to feel
Ready to provide for my seed
A man now, bet you can't believe its me
You ruined a good thing
And all of our dreams
Trying to lock me down a life time in the bing
Monitoring my calls
Piping at mah dogs
Shit, I never really understood the cause
My friends were your friends
Your friends were my friends
Your dough is my dough
My dough is my dough
Mono e mono
We'll foot this weather
And everybody that been through it, then sing it together

Y-Yeah
Once again

Bucktown USA is the place where I rest
Should I say chill cause there ain't no rest for me yet
Shit, I can't say chill, cause the property's hot
Got to get it while the gettin' could be got or get not
Cause of those who cock block, or those who get not
Spillin' beans like a cook to them crooked ass cops
To all my G's don't snooze
Cause they crews in blues and whites
Comin' to the PJ's lookin' for fights
Mr. Officer cool down your temper
Me just cool you n'alf to come like no murderer
I try to do my thing, and you try to take me in
Have me stressed with a bunch of dope fiends in the pen
Then again
That's the place where you see the same face in thew street
Everybody got to charge the beat
Once again
Facin' the magistrate with the screwface
Bounce on the D.A. TS done beat a new case

Bucktown
Home where the grass is greener
And all the gods and earths choose a court in Medina
Bucktown
The place where I received my roots
Got put on to this loot
And got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the G-S-3-0-0
On the side of the road
Gettin' harrassed by po-po's
Bucktown
Home of my B-C-C
And everybody that I roll with, the family

Boot Camp's the way of life for a loner like me
Constantly holdin' courts in the street with police
Like the sergeant 81st, pretty boy is what they call 'em
Said he was a gun man, duke is kinda brawlic
Speaks with an accent, Guyanese I would imagine
A hot-headed dred known for jumping into action
We danced a few times
He got his, I got mine
Called the whole force up to pat us down for the crime
Said it's all about a quarter and his veins bleed blue
Your man Rudy, Giuliani fucked it up for you
Ain't gonna be no dice throwin'
Dead that weed blowin'
Domestic violence, automatic five, he ain't jokin'
Now you first offenders are gettin' hit like predicates
Goin' through the system just for standin' on the strip
Gotta keep an open eye when it's time to cop la
From dirty ass deeds and unmarks ridin' by

Bucktown
Home where the grass is greener
And all the gods and earths choose a court in Medina
Bucktown
The place where I received my roots
Got put on to this loot
And got my first Tim boots
Bucktown
See me in the G-S-3-0-0
On the side of the road
Gettin' harrassed by po-po's
Bucktown
Home of my B-C-C
And everybody that I roll with, the family

Home of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
And bank safe crackers
Pot-pushin hustlers and everyday jackers
When flauntin' get cautioned if you don't ride with the right crew
 and bust off when they can front on you
I still do
Smoke buds with the thugs
About to face the judge
Show all my niggas love
I can't knock the hustle, get your cream by all means
Do what you gotta do to live, to feed you and your seeds

Bucktown's everywhere I see
Representatives livin' nocturnally
Break a day on the regular
All night is all right with us
As long as we can get rid of the red we get the better
But never lose your head, just maintain
Only use the cushion pain to ease your brain
No strain
When Tek and Steele bang
Ain't shit changed from birth
B-C-C degrees, on to them other planes

Bucktown
Home where the grass is greener
And all the gods and earths choose a court in Medina
Bucktown
The place where I received my roots
Got put on to this loot
And got my first Tim boots

Jyeah
This beat the first time I ever testify
The homie looked me in my eye, told me he heard Smif-N-Wessun died
That statement takes us to a new zone
Fool what'chu on? Thinkin' what would the write up on our tombstone?
Would they protect God's legacy or reject it?
End of the day respect just a matter of perspective
We break bread with the apes
Sat with the best of them and repped for the clique like Sean Price resurrected

I'm back up in ya (In ya)
Playtime's over, nigga (It's over, nigga)
Vacation had to end now it's back to business (Let's get back to it)

Toolz of the Trade,Tek N Steele: Reloaded,2005.0,"Tek: Take it back ta like motherfucking eighties and shit (we loooooooove, youuuuuu.....)

My first love was a deuce-deuce, nice and slim
Tucked in my Chucker boots, what a priceless gem
When I took her out to the clubs, we got right in
She kept me safe, even held me down in fights with men

I like my murder mommies loud and thick
Handle tight on grip, not shy to spit
Make daddy proud of shit
Four foot' five hooker, move the whole crowd looker
Short stack black, well-done beef cooker

My tre-eighty kept me crazy dunn, she had me whipped
In the whip high, riding by, ready to spit
She like to talk shit, she's a cocky bitch
Firm grip, all black, like liquorice

I sleep with hoes and, creep with hoes
Eat off hoes, I love these four-fours
Or the 9 double, in the L Bubble
Smash security with sumthin, we all in the scunnel

These are the tools of the trade
(That we use to get paid)
When we cruise in Escalades on escapades
(With guns ablaze)
Been amazed since the younger age
(Saved from the hunger pain)
Bang when the trouble came
(Pioneers of gun slang)
How you with them things?

Fire to the game (My system be thumping)
(Pa-POY-POY) Pa-POY-POY....(The sounds of guns bussin')
Pa-POY-POY......(Your heart just stopped pumping)]

It was love at first sight when I burst the pipe
Off the project roof in the middle of night
On the block, Independence day, pistols ignite
Ghetto tunes we vibe to, write rhymes and recite
Nigga, my forty-four was raw, she had me wired
Had my dick rock-solid, first time I fired
Had a sis that was silent, Smif-N-Wessun medallion
Only fuck with professionals, and kids with thousands

One bitch her ass was plump
Nickname China shotgun, nigga used to love how she pumped
She kept the money looking double barrel
Shoe string around my neck, the whole party peril(?)
You run your whole apparel
Boots, coats, chains, rings and wallets
Break your pockets. Love when niggas think they brolic
Jump up and wanna wrestle, dog we don't tussle
Squeeze off, let a gang of little pellets touch you

These are the tools of the trade

When we cruise in Escalades on escapades

Fire to the game (My system be thumping)
Pa-POY-POY....(Sounds with guns bussin')
Pa-POY-POY......(Your heart just stopped pumping)

Get 'em at six, when they brains open a range
Show 'em the reins, and how to squeeze eight of them things
Let them grow for a spell, then I catch 'em at twelve
With the one in their head, that's how I'm taking the L
When they graduate to sixteen, it's all bets off
Shells casings no relations, when the semi's lettin off

My nine milli had me silly, smoking 'dro in phillies
Feeling like a big Willy, takin' cabs to the city
Seven-forty illy, twisting the sticky hash from Ricky
Trigger itchy, nice and slippy, fuck wit me
Have you ever seen a forty five before?
Big Mac-11 nozzle right 'pon your jaw

These are the tools of the trade

Dry Snitch,The Rude Awakening,1998,"Here's the science, it seem like yesterday to me
H.N.B. robbery, in Manhattan for currency
Sittin up in the crib, drawin out a map
On where security was gon leave the door open at
Park the van around back, the M.P. jet black
We should be in and out 60 seconds flat
So son what's the deal? He ain't takin his route
He rather stay home like a bitch, and have a allaby
What his cut look like, he think he takin half
While we do all the dirt, he sit home on his ass
I got a funny feeling son, somethin just ain't right
Kinda glad I didn't go wit Rum and them that night
And sure enough nigga, you best to believe
Duke snitched under the hot light, like steady people
Wit a vote than a Clinton, Rum and me
Him in cell 2, and me in cell 3

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Me off the job would of been easy, if son wouldn't have been greedy
I told him to parle, cuz he one high jet speedin
Laughin, countin, tryin to play with money he ain't got
No knowledge of himself, and the trigger gave him heart
He just finish biddin, some remote federal prison
D said he was quotin niggas, word to word shittin
To get a light of sense, evedent as I remember
When Dunn Dunn got knocked, I just seen him last summer
At Soul In The Hole, it was a King E. King game
First time out his crib, the kid got body, he got blamed
For being the last one seen, fleein from the scene
Walk was with him up there, he said Duke was held obscene
On some in and out a cell, C.O. slayed him on his mail
His family got banked, he out on 200 foul bail
Myself I don't trust, and that's ya man, so you bust him
Cuz every man, know a dead man don't answer questions

It was all love, when push came to shove
I had back, till one kid got clapped
They lock g, for conspiracy, he turn around tryin rattle me, Arabic
I know about this type of shit, snitches do exist
To all my dunns, holdin guns, gettin funds, watch ya self
Thru most of ya crimes by delf

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

She said she love me, but she took me for granted, when she panic
Flip the whole street, to some shit I couldn't handle it
From my man from up the hill, what the deal?
The block is heatin up, and I need to cop steel
Come and see me, come bring dough cuz, I can't afford a freebie
And come alone son, cuz cats know to be snitchin on TV
Be easy, I'm out but my love wanna tease me
Shorty want some attention, not to mention wanna please me
Hold tight, I'll be back in a flash, don't worry
You got money honey, stop actin funny
Out the door, to care of my B.I.Z
And I know this muthafuckas thats eyein me
Is it a set-up, I peel but I make a detour
And come back, and see my shorty talkin wit the law
I witnessed her trappin bout my business
Where I be goin, who I know in the indus-try
She sex me good, but I should of known
Come into this world alone, leave this world alone, word is bond

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit
Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you

Blown Away,The Rude Awakening,1998,"I got so much trouble on my mind, refuse to lose
But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose
But I'm not trying to sing the blues
Cause life goes on, remembering the verse
Nitty showed me a song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellow when Juda blaze the Cocoa
But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick em off, soon be back to build yo
On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows
My peeps keep me grounded, so my head don't blow
It's a struggle but the more I smoke the more my mind flow

Losing my mind, tryin' to stay high
Everybody fuckin wit me, cuz they know I keep a pound of trees
Cuz I gotta maintain in me
But I'm losing my mind, tryin to stay high
Gotta link with my P.N.C

It's the life of my man who lived for the root of all evil
I can't knock him though, cause we was once consider peoples
We broke bread at the same chicks crib
Two ribs we just roughed up
Gums we just brushed up
I burglarized my first joint playin with stack money
Who motto was ""I die for it"" quote from Stack Money
Head Capo, cause shots round the Big Apple
Ain't never been no punk, my guns bust directly at you
Would of sworn he was the thoroughest, came through in the prettiest
Big boy Benz, 500-S series
Bumpin' ""For the Love of Money"" by the group the O'Jays
Spotted the half smoked Philly comin' out the ashtray
I didn't even know, just knew my man Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which spot he cocked
He returned the death stare, eyes full of blood shot
Try to block it wit a chuckle, hit that shit nigga fuck you
Buck him, pull my coat, just huff on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin' on the oolahs
Won't hit the spliff less I see you twist up the buddhas

I'm losing my mind, rollin' my dime
Friend of mine, tryin' to lace my weed
That's a muthafuckin' friend I don't need

It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game
I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst
Shit that's what happen when you thrust
You think you comin home, but you meetin chrome
You really thought you had the throne, cuz you was the bone
On the block, as the bomb rock, now you
Under a rock, so the money stop
Didn't know the rules of the game so you plan flop
Niggas seein' a vision, tryin' to make it to the top

Now I'm losin my mind, gotta take time
If I wanna roll that weed, cuz you know I gotta roll it in the leaf
Can't fuck with no phillies
I'm losin my mind, smokin my dime
On the lo lo from these
Cuz you know them niggas lookin for me
From some shit back from the 80's
I'm losin my mind, fuckin wit ya niggas one time...

I just want all yall to keep the faith, and never lose it
Coming straight from the heart
Cause in this game, it's a struggle
But I just want you to keep strong, and move along",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-blown-away-lyrics

Wanna flip like kick shit like us
Wanna bust like you ain't rough like us

Ding! That's the sound of the bell
""Oh shit!"" is all you heard before you fell
To the canvas, all washed up like my dirty drawers
And pants get, try to challenge get damaged
Plain and simple, with bandages around your temple
Easily erased out the picture like pencil
Peeped me once, saw me again got your pistol
I put permanent fear in your heart like a dimple

Son hold my A.V. let me rock this no-body
Comin out the closet tryin to stop my money?
Actin' like it's sweet 'cause he ain't see me in the streets
Spit that blood out and get back up on your feet
You called me I was there on some Candyman shit
Wear that ass out in front your kids and your bitch
Hurt you to the boards, put the ten to your jaw
Walk away, parley in front of Achmed's store

We don't give a WHAT about you, tell them niggas who sent you
Let 'em come, have 'em all open wide like dentals
Heard they work for cheap, think I might rent you
If you feel I disrespected you, good, I meant to
Nigga I'd wish you'd, talk about runnin' for guns
Get your Bankhead Bounce like insufficient funds
Left ass-out a home beggin' like bums
Cut off, swept off the floor like crumbs

I'm from N.Y.C.I.T.Y. stay high
Lazy eye, ghetto celeb, rap guy from Bed-Stuy
Splash in two lines, me no long rhymes
Losin' your attention takin' up your time
I gets mine and breathe, 'bout it 'bout it like P
Too many wannabe me, wanna flow blow hold dough
Like Smoky (Smoky Lah), fly across seas
Blow shows for B.C.C. (knock you out), but you can't be
You heard me, you soft like porridge
You ain't gettin' money and you have no courage
(Aiyyo son, let me at they ass son)

Introducing, the one who gets you bugged like a lucie
Same height, same weight, same fight skills like Bruce Lee
Try me, ready for those who wanna harm me
Don't toy with me, you wanna be all you can be, join the Army
I swarm like bees, plus sting too, bring grooves
I blow 'em out like hankies (hachoo!) nab you like cops do

For the longest I've been waitin', to take it to these Jafaicans
Corner eyeballin' on the moves that we was makin'
Thinkin' that we lost it 'cause our line was closed
Can't stop a hungry nigga with nuttin' to live foe
I'mma see that dough, many hustlers I know
Three car longshark white chalk and celo

Yo, I think I'll take this time to remind you
Not to step out of line, test mine, CrimeStoppers won't find you
Before we come kickin' your door to the floor
Throw you to the wall, makin' you our prisoner of war
Cut you too short to take walks with Tattoo
Attack you from your front open yo back with my scalpel
Snatch two, niggas from the crew if they got
Anything to do with motherfuckers coming back to avenge you
I intend to, get down for my temple
Keep a strong mental when dealin' with evils that men do
Them who, fail to comprehend I
Recommend you remember you're dealin' with men who'll
Send you - - off in a coffin
'Cause far too often niggas are gettin' lost and it's costin'
Body parts, from anybody that starts
We play the hackers, takin' rappers apart
Dissect 'em, from they rectum, to they necks
Double check them make sure shit's correct then direct them
To the section, where the session's, in progression
Where you come to get blessed by Smif-N-Wessun",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-won-on-won-lyrics

But you're best to have them ones out when the boys come in to rush ya
Thinking cuz you know some thugs them slugs can't touch ya]
Don't be thinkin' cuz they give you pounds and hugs them boys won't fuck ya
[Well let me tell you home boy you got another thing coming
If you think me and my son's gonna spend our whole lives' strugglin'
My dues been paid] And my blocks been bubbling
You listening to the flow killer  niggas know I'm no quitter
 and getting sick of 
 How I miss ya, see how my swagger swigger
You a five thrower, let me show you I throw one bigger
 You don't want us to come get'cha
[Fuck the ones you brung with ya, hope you brung your ones wit'cha
Ass bent, bet the gun get ya, my life is uncensored
It won't be a pretty picture when them slugs kiss ya]
My dude don't tell 'em nothing, I want them to start fronting
And let them feel the pressure of the cranium crushing
See the fluid gushing out 
From the body to the sewer, bin needing flushing out
Hook:
 and done that
 till our ones stack
 Got some back

 We give back
Nigga this ain't no come back

That's the reason I rock fellow, I ain't sign to the Roc-a-fella
I'm just trying to stock up cheddar]
When it's popping on the block only options to pop Beretta's
Wear a mask oh, hell no, we blow at the (Po-Po)
Forty caliber, chose for weapons, 
That I'm shell-shocked  family in the Boondocks
 get your bank stocking, head cocking
Courtesy of me, that you stretch like a T
 we call it the white meat
See how mafias will move, we cement your shows
You riding the current, with the fishes you'll snooze
 For muscle we got two-shotters
[And the block stand beside us, they know that we true riders
Show love to the hood, and the hood do the same

Not Daryl Simmons but D Ace I runs house
Smack earth, wind and fire out niggas who run mouth
Streets cold like the winter, birds gone fly south
Put your kids in a corner like time out
Look nigga, I don't give two fucks what you rhyme 'bout
All your boring war stories, your shorty's, your lyin' 'bout
Get you all up in the hallway your body is lying now

Nigga, we dough getters
Ho' hitters, you got to feel us
Cocksuckers
You know why? We gorillas
Spot rushers, head busters
The flow so vicious, you motherfuckers made you can't touch us
Gun holster on my shoulder
Money folder, bank stopper
Brand dropper, six thrower
Louie rocker, bottle of clicq' popper
And for the green card I get your ass laced proper

See me, I ain't got ta'
Introduce myself I'm the bank stopper
Win the dice game proper
7-1-8 Partna'
The zip code, where the fifth flows, a clip load
At your kinfolk, get dough, no info
For the price though, we gutter we don't talk
Leave it on the streets like skellyboards and old chalk
These things on our waist somehow give us a cold heart
The closest thing to a Benz in my hood was a go-kart

We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?
We from the swamps
Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?
We from the swamps
Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
Nope

The hammer come with a coola'
That might slam into your medulla
It's bug what I do for the love of Karim the ruler
Showed me maneuvers I use the Ruger to shoot ya
For snoozing I leave you losers behind a pool of manure
Do ya just like Medusa, body stiff not moving ya
Your mommy sitting boo hooin'
Your boo is screwin' a new friend
You and your crew gonna need more than a deuce deuce to move in
Got guns like Bruce Bruce on heavy metal music

You're kinda young so just let me learn you
That I keep a 40. underneath the thermal
And a leather pair of stowaway gloves
So it's, no prints, no bodies, no judge
And that means no case no charges
You an atheist if you don't fuck with the god
And I turn stacks, thousands from pennies
Coppin' PRP jeans right from 

And I cop bottles of E&J from right from Richie
Liquor store, get a whore then go pipe her silly
In a room for like 50 dollars
No we not doing dinner at no Benihana's
I just ordered chicken, holla
Ma I'm so gutter, no sister, no brother
One mother, no father, no problem, oh brother
Y'all gonna jump me again? Let's do it bitch
Cuz like the only thing running is my nose when I'm sick

We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?

Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
We're gonna stomp through

I was born and raised to know, recognize, slow all di hate

Rudebwoy grown upon his own damn two
Runnin' 'round doin' what the rudebwoy do
Wanna be a bad man
He was born up in the badland
Never knew his father
No one there to give him guidance
Started smokin' marijuana
Hanging out, having all nighters
His mommy never liked it
She told him I won't come visit you in Rikers
She said: you never wan' go Rikers Island
He caught a charge for carrying a gun
For some it's rites of passage
(To the streets we make a marriage)
Concrete jungle with the savages
(We facin’ different challenges)
Only the strong will survive
(Living in the belly) ‘cause the beast swallow you alive
Preaches couldn’t save him (but a gangster still prays)
Keep the humble when you hustle
Live to see another day

I was born and raised
In a place everyday where bullets nuh stop reign
I was born and raised
Wit' a spliff inna mi mout' and a gun 'pon me waist
I was born and raised
By di pimps an' di hustlers, the homeless, the strays
I was born and raised to know, recognize, slow all di hate

What type of nigga, slang and bang in the streets?
(A bad man)
That's the type of company you keep
They say the energy gets circulated
(Vibes get communicated)
The actions and the mannerisms imitated
Sharp dressed (Jah Bless)
When you see 'em salute your highness (Salute!)
He's one of fifteen out his daddy's sack
Him was a true gun man so him come from that
Raised in the ghetto singin' songs of survival
Where we learn to conquer fears and our friends become our rivals
It's a concrete jungle where the savage rules
And violence begets violence, wah yuh do?
Live fast, die young
You never know when the death angel come
Life is shorter than a midget on the curbside
So, lift up your life and enjoy the ride

I was born and raised
In a place everyday where bullets nuh stop reign
I was born and raised

Top of the world (Great place to be)
Yeah, yeah

People be asking' what's happenin' with these rappin' dudes
Just enjoyin' the view from this altitude
They can't help but show hatred when you be makin' moves
We out for that callaloo like Jamaican food
We set a place for two, break bread where bosses dine
Courside 'til Dru-Ha said it's your time
The discography read like an anthology
The education of Smif N Wessun is not a comedy (No)
Ain't no apologies, fabrications or fallacies (Nope)
Follow the protocol, dedication is the policy (Yep)
Now slumlord's owning properties
Even a homeless man knows it's currency over policy (That's right)
But they jealous of the comradery
We had to downsize, quality over quantity
Enter the stage, billboard pages acknowledge we
Look up, see us in the stars like astrology
Raise the voices up a couple decibels (Raise 'em up)
They can sing let it ring through the vestibule
Don't they sound so heavenly?
I say it like a G, I miss my brother P
Influential, tempermental
I'm settin' the tempo straight from the intro
Now everybody jewlry is authentic
And don't nobody care about the music business (No)
Except the culture vultures and the soul snatchers
Hard doin' business with you cracker ass crackers
Stop geekin' (Stop geekin')
Y'all niggas dope fiends (Word)
Fuckin' with that Molly and promethazine
That will will end ya life quicker (Quicker)
Than any type of liquor takin' out ya liver
The God swifter than a scammer with a scanner (Scanner)
Blam ya with the hammer (Hammer)
Ladies, pardon my manners
But when it's all types of bitches sayin' you the man (Uh)
It get hard to keep ya dick in ya pants
I ain't hateful, I'm faithful (No)
Yeah, I fucked up, I made mistakes too (Word, uh)
That's why when you find a true one, it's only right
That you make her an honest woman and make her your wife
And by no means I ain't better than anybody (Naw)
I just know how shit go down in clubs and after parties (I just know how shit go down, na'mean?)
When the loud is lit and the bottle poppin'
And it be mostly niggas doin' the dick ridin' (Uh)
It's time we call a spade a spade (Word)
Real recognise real, y'all lookin' hella lame (Word)
Hard hittin', don livin', God given
No harm or infliction upon women and children (Naw)
It was written what I'm spittin' only kings be sittin'
Play ya position, hired help, stay in the kitchen
A crown on the wrist, a pound or a fifth
I'm just shootin' you a jewel, consider it a gift

So everything that comes to birth owes something to the give up
You owe to your father, honour
You owe to your mother, honour
But to God, you owe your all
Not to a government
Not to a flag
Not to a king
Not to a ruler
You owe it all",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-intro-the-education-of-smif-n-wessun-lyrics

I hope you read it, love is the message
It hurts to see you working so hard, wish I could do more
Me and Tek back in the yard working on new songs
Stayed in my corner making sure they did no harm when
I was out on the corners, couldn't do no wrong
You smiled when your first born had his first born
I made the beat cry when I put the verse on

There's no easy way for me to start
So I'ma say what's on my mind and what's in my heart
I know you watching over, I could feel ya presence
I hope the angels read this letter to you up in Heaven
I miss coming home off the road then coming to your house, telling you 'bout the shows
Some are better than others
We all have our days, I'll always love my mother

Forever, you'll have a place in my heart

Wish I was more involved, I know you probably feel neglected
You on my mental hour, minute, second
That song and father bond, go to arms to protect it
And while I'm out on tour, we still connected
Love you with all my heart, shining star my reflection

Everybody say you look just like me, you got my features
As a black man, I have so much to teach ya
I'ma give ya this one jewel
We're descendants of kings and you'll be one soon
You ain't gotta rush, set your own pace
Life is a journey, it is not a race
So rumble, young man, rumble

Yeah, I penned you a letter, did you get it?
The family members dead and gone or in prison
No, we don't always get along but I listen
My bros and cons, the friendship authentic
And to my wisdom, you my best gem
Stress you to death, never the less my best friend
All I put through, you still put trust in me
This ring explain why I'm thankful you fuck with me

To my brother, cold cheeks
I believe in ya, keep bangin' out them beats
To my cousins, nieces, nephews, shine
I fuck with all y'all, y'all my life line
To my bestie, you know I keep you in my prayers
Fuck a sickle cell, we warriors over here
And last but not least, to my PNC
I love you, my nigga, peace

Let’s get it on
Stick ‘em up

Smif-N-Wessun is sworn to take what we’ve earned
From day one, me and my son, 
my son and me
, we stick
Together like family, so don’t challenge we
Right now, it’s all about the currency, and I’m
Representing the 211 with my new gun
So who’s funny with money that’s mine or yours
Or have a lot on his mind
 and even more in his drawers?  
No losses
Get took by these two crooks from Crooklyn
—that’s
My word—
so if you’re looking for a herb, keep looking
.  Yeah
‘Cause we be looking too.  Mr. Rippa, what you wanna do?
On the creep, catch a crew that’s sleep
, get ‘em
For the cash—
don’t forget the stash that’s hidden
No time to waste, slip up, soft forbidden
‘Cause this here is where we remain as pioneers
Nothing to fear 
while we smell dough in the air

But everything’s real in the core of the streets, 
where you do
Go to war
 but you don’t go to sleep.  
Don’t peep
‘Cause I got you covered, and I’ll advise you
Don’t try to run ‘cause I might surprise you
The eyes do see a lot
, we be on-point
To the point ‘cause some gods try to blow spots
, but
My joint keeps me easy, 
gentle
Squeezes
 to release is what please me
Kush and pain to maintain a solid frame
, gotta
Stay a step ahead of any changes in the game
Criminal-minded
, search and you’ll find it
We do our own thing
 ‘cause society’s blinded
But I’m reminded
 that it’s time to get paid
‘Cause move-fakers fall in the grave that they made
Who’s safe from the neighborhood troublemakers?

Kept me strong ever since she let the seed out

Wanna take it from em, or take it to em

Whats the reason of life, stack doe or live trife
Become a family man supportin kids and a wife
Like your pops who break his back to bring home likkle scratch
Or black who pushed the Ac' OT with G-packs
Makin a killin by fulfillin dreams so by his man borne

Or do I greez my steez, purchase a 2-piece
Walk in some company, talkin bout hire me
Watch your heart catch money bags

Like it's planned to be, flow gradually
Had to take everything, nothing hand to me
For the money, I respect have me kickin your door
You're in trouble when you can't see the angel no more

This little nigga seen a lotta ill shit in my life

Loves to fuck, and live life allustrious

I ain't tryin to get my family involved in gun blaze

If I didn't I'd be in the I.C. unit losin fluid)
But I know this ain't the end lord
We got used to it
(And I know this gun is not my friend lord
It's like we like to use it)
It's like we like the music
It's like we like the bullshit
I get frustrated by the bullshit and easy to pull shit
(Give me somethin you can feel this)
Stainless Steel shit

And if I ain't your killa, I still cry for you
Lord knows I'm not a murderer, I'm just good at what I do
(So If my lifes on the line, and my backs on the wall
May the lord be with you when I back up the four)
And may the lord be with you when your backs on the floor
Chokin on your own blood, cuz you relaxed during war

Motherfuckers want us outta the picture (is that so?)
In the streets you can die to that (gotta go)
Stop your blood flow, you cowards can't eat no more
Money gotta a nigga dress to woe

Head shots turn a coward into vegetable)
Hot ones to your vest and clothes
By professional, once it blow, god best it goes
(Take yo tokes, lookin to pretty to throw
Anyway we're you goin ain't gonna need it no more
Kickin grown rap, but a cocaine rap
Disrespect that, get your old man slapped
Strong arm tact's have your whole fam whacked
P.N.C. the best hit you back to back
Chest to chest, strip your ears, wrist and neck
Stop talkin like a killer if you scared to death)

Off the Wall,The Rude Awakening,1998,"Let me ask this question real quick, umm, as far as the Smif-N-Wessun and the name change and everything like that; now how did that come about? How did that evolve into the Cocoa Brovaz and everything like that?
That was jealousy, man, that's all that is, man (Jealousy, man)
Jealousy and ignorance, man
Yeah
Niggas got me stressed, man
Oh, just burn a spliff don't worry about that

In my pink Cadi, I have a 
Uncle Sam arms men to kill in the 'hood
I make 'em snap it, test it
My choice of weapon
That Smif-N-Wessun, mmmmm
Try
Sue me for the namesake
Yo, who's pimpin'
Yo, who's pimpin' who?

I woke up in the morning, what did I see
Unknown faces starin' down at me
First thought was to flee
As fear overpowered me
Chlorophyll got me ready to black, I can't breathe
Niggas askin' me who's Smif and who's Wessun
We got you now we're lookin' for your partner cause you're messin'
With the incomin' currency
And frankly we don't give a fuck about your privacy
We been watchin' you for a while now
We know about the calls made back and forth down south
Word of mouth
You had your peoples workin' out
But I doubt you had 'em lookin' out
Cause we can pick 'em out
Now we got 'em listed on our internet systems
Know about the crimes and the names of all their victims
Even got the pinpoint spot of where you hang
You got big dreams comin' 'round tryin' to change things

Let me sing
While they try to suffocate and stifle all of our intentions
The amount of suffarations, trial and tribulations, too much to
Mention
Well, tell them that we no 'fraid
We done have we brigade
From every corner, angle, and section
When I say Babylon going fall
I see dat inna me crystal ball
Them say they oughtta that's off the wall!

I got subpoenaed by the government the other day
I opened it and read it
It said they was suin'
Said I couldn't move the way that I was movin'
And I couldn't do the things that I was doin'
Causin' mass confusion with the name that we was usin'
Said they gun sales was conflictin' with our music
Sent me multi-paid contracts just to prove it
The trademarks on belt-buckles, shirts, and knives
Ain't that the most off the wall shit you heard in your life
Probably heard his junior singin' Mr. Ripper's in your area
Feel your heart skip a beat as I'm nearin ya
I'm hearin' ya
Askin' your seed, who is me
At the same time you break my classic CD
Runnin' to the phone callin' up Liebertz & Libertz
I had it up to here with these damn rap neegers
They even got my local boys sayin' that stuff
I want a draft complaint made up for a million bucks

I gotta letter from the corporate the other day
I open and read it
They said they was suin'
Somethin' about we was causin' confusion
Wanted me and my son to change the name we was usin'
Had our associates nervous
Suits tryin; to serve us
Got our investors actin' real shady tryin' to jerk us
Got Tek ready to break somethin'
Adrenaline stayed pumpin'
Say somethin'
I tell you why the frame won't even think nothin'

Bad boy, we fed up of the bullshit
The stress? it make me have to roll a next spliff
Me see the whole of them come
They want them share but I know them soul deceive
The more you succeed that's when you see them greed
That's how me know the whole of Babylon fi fall down
 and if it be hail
We must prevail
 go send them letter well that is just junk mail
Tear that up and fling that 'pon the garbage pail
Me sing
Hell fell
Oh, well
I yell
Swell
We gonna send dem down a hell
Hell fell
Oh, well
I yell
Swell
We gonna send dem down a hell
With their rhetoric
We gonna send dem down a hell
And their politricks
We gonna send dem down a hell
And their statistics
We gonna send dem down a hell

So you're hesitant
Where a brother quest to represent
I sense no hinder, gender, two-faced intent
In fact, cops signed the last government
Contract
Yeah, umm
So where's your first world war
Now presently on tour
Hardcore
Come on knockin' at your door
Your revolver took down many of '90's lords
Cut to that ad campaign, your gun stores
So they welcome your floor of a tribe called Cocoa",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-off-the-wall-lyrics

I learned death young, believe me it hurts
My sister came in a cradle went away in a hearse
I put family first, you could get enemies with these
Who's your man at first
Take this more serious than just a verse
Some nigga's want to life their life, scared to get in the dirt
Can't afford to pay the price when you're doing that work
But look holmes, change work before you're laying in church
Face toward the lord ass to the earth
Because you played tough on the wrong turf
Let's pray if anything you learnt
When the cards get dealt fake niggas will melt
Stop following fools and believing in jerks

Ears clipped as pups
That attack at the nuts when I yell click up
I got gunners and runners in the hood I stay
'Til this day, never saw you where I lay
Fuck the smoke, must want yo life to close
Get found buckwheated on a darkened road

I know you've been waitin'
Whisperin' and talkin'

Aproach this, you can hold this

Still Fighting,The Album,2007.0,"Anybody know what this place is?
50 thousand men died right here
Fighting, the same fight, that we still fighting among ourselves

Shiiiit
You know we like, we like crabs in a bucket
How to get what we need, we
Hate to see the next succed (don't say that man)
Cause we too been done greed
That's why we stare at each other's pockets
Always trying to see what's in next one's wallets
Trap ourselves in a mental containment
Greed, ignorance, selfishness you name it
Chris rocks said a joke, I think we all overlooked
You wanna hide your money, just put it in the book, cause
We know we the shit consistently
How we gonna be equal in a economy?
I was taught that the five percent nation
Was to teach the other 85 wasted
Energy in a wrong direction, so
Tek and Steel possesed Smiff n Wessun and
Together each achieves more
Thats what the letters and word team stand for
We can but we can't keep blaming the Man
He do it cause we let him keep the power in hand
And us on the streets hadn't graduated in classes
Looking for a sisters with a ghetto asses
But some do grind like they get they mind right
Cleaning money up and get out of the hood life
We give big awards to speakers, not doers
That's how the hood wink bam ??? to fooled us

Killed my brother, now it's in my heart
Hatred, destroyed my family

Imagine being arrested or shackled against your will
Imagine the transatlantic of slavery was really real
Only you ain't got to imagine cause slavery was really real
For real where plenty died and many others were killed
I read about it in a history books when ??? lived
But it never said nothing about Huttin or Emmett Till
Until me and Allah began to build
Then started doing the knowledge they had on back of the bill
'99 Illuminati revealed, as soon as the ball dropped
We'll be up they spell
Theory or not, conspiracy? I can't tell
Biggie and Pac who got them shot? I can't tell
That's the type of information have you ass in cell
Too many messages in rap, records probly won't sell
It's like writing rhymes like writing my will
Got my freedom on one them line and i fight for it still
I don't want to be a lifer in jail, read revolution poems about mustafa kallil
Telling my lawyer that we got to appeal
Because living behind bars is like living inside hell
My man Rell came home from doing twelve
We touched down I struck down shotgun shell *pop*
Oh well, same story will tell
Man I'm going back to africa to fuck with Chappelle
Listen, take a lesson from the dead, if we don't come together, right now in this hour, we too shall",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-still-fighting-lyrics

Smif-n-Wessun is the band that I'm reppin'
The brand of the weapon
The reason why you have to respect 'em
And it's official just to answer your questions
So tell the press that Mr. Smif and Mr. Wessun just stepped in
We locked and reloaded, got lots of ammunition
The titles back, the semi-auto rifles in position (buck em!)
Pop in the clip we're facing obstacles and opposition
Talk limited 'cos snitchin' not in my religion
We gain riches, rappers spilling they business
While the rap task force putting niggas in prisons
And I'm still dippin', hittin' the bar hard and benchin'
In the trenches, try and avoid a long sentence
Pot pinchin', pockets itchin' the clock is tickin'
Get busy the plot thickens so stop your bitchin'
Stop griffin' unless you ready to stary lickin'

Back for the youth, words coming out my mouth is the truth
And it's as pure as a brick you don't stretch
So sit you don't touch, don't wanna step on it too much
But this is how we ran it down the lines
Steele with rhymes, I'll fuck you up at any given time
 shorty get naughty
He tried to beat me so  true story
My stripes is what make me connected

Now look at this kid, man, look at him, man
Look at this guy

How you out here moving dumb acting like life is sweet?
You a grown man, take a stand or be a casualty
Some beef is never ending, war is unpredictable
Can't trust everybody, that includes ya people too
Quick to judge and hate on you, saying how you did them wrong
How the hell is he my man? He ain't even put me on
It get even realer when a brother in his feelings
Depressed and ambitionless, I pray for the children
Some say my suit will make me unrecognizable
Everybody ain't a devil, I can see the god in you
Success come with failure, I been up and I been down too
How you act when you have everything is what defines you
Pray five times a day, tryna find my way
Talk about a weapon, yeah, so now what critics gon' say? Nothing
Gotta dress the part, keep a loyal heart

What you believing in, follow your goals and dreams

Some say when you believe in the unbelievable
That's when you achieve the unachievable
And by applying that work ethic that leaders do
Each effort effective with life aggressor, some methods seem unreasonable
By all means necessary, my worst enemy is me, my own adversary
Know it's hard playing the games God hand ya
You lose when you dealing with delusions of grandeur
Yeah, it's great to have an imagination
Imagine greatness not having to sell your soul to Satan
I walk a crossroads exploring my limitations
All that glitters ain't gold, exposing imitations
Scary what some'll do in moments of desperation
Steps we making and cherishing every breath we take in
But please, don't be mistaken
We enjoin' this race until our final destination

Day breaks sneeks upon my camp once more
Get up get dressed and prepare for war
Yo the wars wit everything outside your door
It's a rude awakening but it's more in store

When I walk through Brooklyn people show me love
Went over to GA people showed me love
Went to North Carolina they showed us love
Even went to California and got love from thugz
And it's all good big up to all the neighborhood
That came to see Tek and Steele when ever they could
But remember the struggle continues after the (?)
Watch who ya fuck wit, watch what you get into
Theres a war goin' on outside and in my mental
Gettin' drunk and I wonderin' what does gettin' bent do
Last week my man put a pistol to his temple
I said nah son not that, thats to simple
One little niggie on the block sellin' crystal
Next little niggie got shot up on Bristol
'nother little niggie locked, cause they blew the whistle
Last little niggie did the same bitch shit his little sister
This little niggie be hard to find
Mind don't makin' it in this day and time
Do what we have to criminal or legal
Stayin' alive strivin' wit my people

In days of our lives they try to make us hate
To search for tommorrow got us walkin' the streets
Yo I'm not sweatin' sleet, not really stressin' beef
I'm just tryin' to live, tryin' to eat
Tryin' to stay strong, tryin' not to fall
Tryin' to live to see my unborn get tall
Cause the streets of New York ain't just a walk in the park
You can get your life got in day the or the dark

I give thanks when I rise up, open my eyes up
Calastetic get me right so I'll be nicer
Cause when you feel fit ya feel nice
Beware of the tricks and the full paradise
Like the wicked mind in york with them gun pound caught
Who wish to ambush me when I leave the weed spot
When I get, what I got, roll the lah that I caught
Rock the shines that I rock, make my life clock stop
Wit def me fear not, cause them mores high guys I
Bless me wit protection as the years pass by
Conquerer, mighty rasta
Let no man steel from the pocket peel for ya
It's a meditate and demonstrate, verbal earthquakes
Breakin' down like a junky with a case of shakes
To my dogs flippin' weight and behind gates
Livin' street life, put the stash on Jakes
For ya need, do whateva the deed
Watch shiesty ass bitches and the next man grieves
Mr. Ripper from the star to the hills its all real
Gotta maintain cause the sun don't chill

In days of our lives we strive to make ends meat
To search for tommorrow got us walkin' the streets

Back 2 Life,The Rude Awakening,1998.0,"To all my peeps locked down, comin back 2 life
I know it's been a mega zone, since I sen't you this kite
But I had to K.I.M., you know the city don't sleep
Put 50 cents in your commisary, reach you next week
The streets still in a shamble, since we last broke bread
And Baby Ra got left, O.T. two in the head
Seen Black cop the ack, you know his numbers ain't match
He still runnin tack jobs from the days of way back
And look at Jose, is wild now, gave birth to my first child
And they move John back to the Isle
Still tryin to hold my dough to see mom straight
Gotta scribe from Jahard said he maxed a rapper's weight
For a rep to 5-10, before we lock in
Askin how's my rappin, wanna know if I'm still boxin
In the center that's the sum, now he been gone for 12 summers
Round the same time a vapor leather b bombers


For the love of money, Red is facin a 8-20
Could of had a 1-3 but the streets were hot and days were sunny
Some niggas stayin runnin for the love of money
Went up to Antarc, slick mix sergeant country

A god a scribe from the god foundation
Same thing nuthin changed, he's maintainin
Just takin every day, he stay inside in stride
Build a whip, a tard, a nepher, trying to stay alive
Tell the god Ja Rule, I'm comin to see him in the fu'
Next V.I., soon as I finish takin care of B.I
I see why that nigga Kay be ready to flip
But let him know Rhino's home, fuckin wit the clique, shit
Imagine if Blueman was there, oh my god
I know that's somethin for the ward and the fair
Oh yeah, if you bump into my nigga Rubble
Tell him me and his brother Sigh got the bundle when he come thru


Told ya moms, tell me stop shittin on me, take the block with my phone
Don't forget about a dog when he away from home
You know I'm trying to blow, but I can still spread love
Cuz he been down for too long, and I ain't seen him in the hood
Plus I always say I'll visit, switch at the last minute
He respect and overstand that I'm takin care of business
But still ain't all, he needs to accept these calls
The one you pass on your way, be the same one you fall
And that's a fact that's been proven till this day it don't pay
To go against the grain and betray family
Plus I just seen Shack he said you change, actin funny
But he don't even wet it, cuz he still gettin money
Son, I be straight, fuckin wit the day from when ya bitch show
Niggas be frontin, but I be reppin bad bro
You know the inside coincide with the out
When I come out, that's half the things we talk about

To all my people lock down, comin back 2 life
We workin hard to bring you home, so we can do this right
I know it's rough in the day, even rougher at night
Hold ya crown, cuz we ready, and we down to fight",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-back-2-life-lyrics

Outside 
postered up, a Mr. Pool in my thugs
It's bug the ones who hold heat is the way they show love
While the drug kingpin, showed his way to baguettes
And pressin looker birds, with his blue face Lex
Throw on his wrist like he's flamin, peer door he be slayin
Broad like iced out, Cardiar chain danglin
I seen him minglin with the high rollers
Rollin high dollars, ballin wit more tricks than Harlem Globetrotters
Got a whole lotta soldiers to his dirty deeds for him
Shorty's the G form
 Little niggas movin keys for him
The d's on
 But couldn't touch him when they caught him
Cuz he support them
 wit the same money that bought him

Aiyo sun, got a minute let me tell you about this one
This young sexy bunny, checkin money to hit somethin
I don't mean fuckin, the only cream she be likin
Is that green stuff that come and make her whole world function
Rebon Capatone, love guns and roses, expesive clothes
With diamonds and niggas that holdin, then she foldin
Rockin Panamanian gold, and ear ring
Bracelet link change with 550 clothin

Young bird, an iceberg, slams ago E.S
Here's press, a platinum rolly, 5 karat necklace
Gotta pay to sex it, she catch ya wallet when you sleepin naked
Throughbread for the dough, cuz she gotta make it
I help to take it, seven digit figure caper
So much paper, cop the Lex, already laced her
From exquisite, faithful to a thug on jail visits
Have fun on the weekend, then it's back to business

Refuse and choose to brave men

Concrete burial, war for you, for all of you
Win or lose, you still lose and that's the rules
The respect I get is just a reflection of my status
Top ranking never catch a smokin in a bandage

Game of Life,The Rude Awakening,1998,"Yeah, after Dah Shinin, it all became clear to me
I knew things would be different son
I knew it'd come time for a change
Seems like the time is now
Jah! Rastafarai
Greetings to my soldiers and soldierettes

Jewel on the world, make the earth sink
On the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reachin' for infinity
Can he be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck, they can't function
Caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it to the finish

As the sun heats, I put my feet to the concrete
Hard to sleep so I take it to the streets
Hold my head up, try to keep it movin'
Fed up with losin'
I need some air
I think I take a cruise with you
I'm using, what little know how I posess
To keep our familia down to rest
Now I stress defensive tactics
Cause police seem active
Got me in the crib sleepin' with heat under the mattress

In case of home intrusion:
First the dogs go ""bark""
Then about five sparks bringin' light to the dark
Like ? does his movement when he's dealin' with math
Or the boss tell his workers where he's keepin' the stash
When that gun blast, better have Jah on your side
Or an act of devine intervention from the most high
I know guys that get a thrill from the kill
And other niggas, who hold the greed to sling ?frills?

Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay

Damn I haven't worked since I was 'bout 17
They had time busy hangin' out being a drama fiend
I had to run the streets, see what the night brought out
Sneak in the crib
Hear my moms prayin' to God that I sprout
Take all responsibilities like a man would do
Cause she know that the streets can bring the worst out of you
She told me concentrate on school but what I do about loot?
I wanna push the fat ride, have bitches sweatin' me too
But you know you need dough so you can do the do
And going to class everyday don't bring in no loot
Plus I just been told that I was cold by club bouncers
Standing there hot headed 'bout to set it while they denounce us
Crab niggas still beggin' for CD's
While brothaz' careers is stuck on halt and freeze
About to face extinction? pockets dead is thinkin'?
Something ain't peace and suicide's part of my thinkin'
Even God don't hear my prayer or him just not care
Got a son in this world, stressed out losin' my hair

Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay

It's time to take the struggle to the pavement
Let the people know the mayor sent the OK for enslavement
Orders from the government
Official stubborn men with egos runnin' shit
They put the hit out on whoever try to get out
And they are the directors who are dead and?
Even down south in Atlanta
Police play the pawn for their master
It's a disaster, practicing who can kill us faster
For less than nothin' like they did Bobby Huton
Corruption got me clutchin' my rifle for gun bustin'
Somethin's cookin'
Look at the way some 
faces be lookin'
Cross the bank rock 
on to Brooklyn
, Texas
Even in Houston P's be shootin' us like sitting ducks in groups
And I can't trust who or what
That will explain the way I watch you, plus
I know the chosen are few
Many come around to proclaim things they know not
Let alone maintain
Shame, some of my worst enemies
Live right around me and look just like me
I see that its time to intensify the movements in front of my eyes
Can't rely on a seeing dog they got me
Or lay and wait for the devil to surprise me, nah G

Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay

It only takes a line to make the mind think
Drop a jewel on the world make the earth sink
I'm on the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reaching for infinity
Plenty be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck they can't function caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it 'till the finish

Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay

It only takes a line to make the mind think
Drop a jewel on the world make the earth sink

Ah where's everybody up
(Speaking Spanish)
(Tony Touch)
It's Tony Toca, the one that's got you screamin ""Esta loca""
Dalle juevo Is my mic Leggo my Eggo
Spanish Harlem all the way to san diego
Make it happen
You know, like movin yayo
I set my product, that shit's far from the palace
Mantequilla not manteco oh senso mia
Cocoa brovaz, hurricane, mida mida
Ton touch sound doofy eatin fajitas
Chillin in the b-boy stance
In my Adidas
While senoritas be screaming Buenos Dias
Rock steady by now you know the steelo
Mi correo still gets down on the leelo
Tahino indians welcome to my teepi
Pop in the CD and let's get freaky
(Speaking spanish)
Boriquia, about to pass it off to the rasta
(Tek)
It's the el generalno
Tell your baqua where's the hydro
If the chocolito make my eyes low
BC a tomb bab with me and my man
Trying to double our ends with the el capitain
(speaking Spanish)
(speaking Spanish)
Undressin me, thinking about sexin me
While I (?)
(Steele)
Blazing, kicking lingo with this bingo
Who got hot making the peicos out in santo domingo
El socio, used to go to the acopulco
Every weekend tricking on chulas, he was beatin
But on the streets of harlem around the grand concourse
He had to force a loco, with amigos he used to boss
A dios mios, just like el ninos (?)
Chorus: (Tek, (Steele))
Harlem got the pace in it (boogie, boogie got the cake in it)
Crooklyn keeps on takin it (queens cats been making it)
(Tek)
I do this for my soldiers in the streets
Who stand toast to toast with the cousin asleep
Making illegal transactions
World-wide connections
Forced up a change like the name smif-n-wessun
See me coming through and my nigga clef too
Or the 650 blowing up the Grant's Tomb
Mobb beats to protect slaying your street bite
Like a killing, over-dealing for the pearly white
(Hurricane G)
Blows down your mother f**king roof
It be hurricane g, subwoofin out ya asshole
From first staff, up through parks from the heart
They better stand though and my niggas up in spanish harlem
Who don't give a f**k and my box stuck cutting up tribal
Forget the hydro, cause we gonna keep it live all night yo
Yeah one love to my fam in boriquia land
My emanitos sparking up trees
112 buddah keys barking up puerto rican queens
Smacking all rice and beans
And you know my emanitas keep it real
In timboso high hills
All my pitycitas who ain't f**king around
Sontaras holdin shit down for the crown
Tony touch, cocoa brovaz and i
Keep the body all high
No doubt
If he CPR in the mother f**king house
I'm talking about crazy puerto ricans
Who beefing
A few heads is busted because I see them leaking
Freaking, because I be frying bitches up like hoochie fritos
For my 5 bitchulitos
Yo, yeah word up and if you can't get wit it then kiss my a*s
But your, on thea real I wanna say one love and rest in peace
To my nigga Bridge from 112
Big up Johnson Projects
Jefferson in the house

Word up one love to the barrio, cocoa brovaz, tony touch and hurricane g

Hold it Down,The Rude Awakening,1998,"Hold me down, I'm movin on the enemy now
For a cause, and he cause ya exort at war
I swore to be dedicated, always elevatin, meditatin
Bout the soldiers who couldn't make it
Take shit forever, that's my position, part of my condition
Is to long live the tradition of the stick n move
Get ya tools ready for construction
We prepare to build or destroy somethin
Brooklyn born, I be Steele on the real
And I feel like gettin it on, yo son what's the deal?
For some reason, niggas be fiendin
And when niggas be fiendin, they be quick to commit treason
But I keep breathin through, though the season do
Be seemin to get alot more hot than usual
So, who can I confide in, who can I trust to bust when I'm ridin
I don't need no last minute surprises
From those who pose as friends but they be lyin
I keep my eye on the snitch that's spyin
Plottin to brake down my whole enterprises
Some niggas soft but some niggas define shit
True soldier ready for war, so don't try shit
Why you get critical, cuz the spots held down by the general

There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
Cuz I know you do the same for me, so hold me down
There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
Cuz I know you do the same for me, so hold me down

Every clique got a soft nigga in it, believe me
That potray a kid he saw on the streets or in the movies
Tryin to do the same he seen on the screen
Got his big guns, Timbs, hoody and his jeans
Talk the fast talk but there's a pause in this walk
Rock his jewels, truck and he still eat pork
He get his little hustle on, he run with his major team
Crazy ass dread from Jamaica, Queens
Ain't never seen war up in his face before
Get his news from the barber shop/beeper store
But if you let him tell it, he's the last man standing
Talkin bout son, I held it down wit the cannon
Should of seen the way that I was blazin at the cats
Twist of the wrist, while I was pattin one back
Like that kid did to Menace, when he had the four pound
You know it's only right, I had to hold the fort down

Blazin wit ya friends, when we ridin
There's no suprisin, it's all good
Takin chances, in the cut every day
Tryin to big up, tryin to big up wit my master plan

There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
Cuz I know you do the same for me, so hold me down
There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
Cuz I know you do the same for me, so hold me down

As a youth I would sit up in my room and dream
One day I became wit a ruthless teen
Little did I know that every step I took
Had already been signed and sealed in some books
So I took a look at what I got to work wit of course
And if granted by the source move on wit full force
What choice to choose, if I sin will I use
Sittin wit the reverend in my county blues

To which ever form you base your religion on
Live by the scriptures of the Bible or Karan
Don't burn bridges if you plan to make riches
The ones that you least expect to be the worst snitches
For a dollar, a nigga screamin holla out
Ya secret whereabouts, so they can come and air ya out
And took the throne, down the shoot dead and gone
The struggle goes on, so hold down ya dome

There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
Cuz I know you do the same for me, so hold me down
There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
Cuz I know you do the same for me, so hold me down",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-hold-it-down-lyrics

I just want to talk to ya
Or should i say rap to ya...
As i sit here holding my pen, ink on my ped
Reminded of the things i did, all that I have
I know where I´ve been, so I know where I´m going
To hell if i don´t pray, that´s what grandma told me, we used to laugh and joke
Now i´m sipping from my glass, saying pass the smoke
Taking trips round the world just to rap at shows
Kids say Smif N Wessun got classic flows
We scribe timeless diamonds, more than just rhymes
Each line could be used as tools for surviving, I ain´t lying, it raised me right
Keep my goals and my aims in sight, this shit crazy right
´cuz even if my rhymes crazy tight, Dj´s won´t play me right
But hey! that´s alright, I know every song i right
Is how i turn all my wrongs to rights
So when i´m wrong i´m right
So when i´m gone you might play the song and remember why you born in life
Everybody has a purpose believe me it´s true
People come into your lives just to leave you with jewels
So if i could do the same, then my job is done
Then the rest is up to you, only god can judge
One
Onlye god can judge
I do the best with the worst i got
Some just want to see you fail
So i´m keeping it moving
I´m keeping it moving
I hear the gossip and the same old rumors
Everybody got a story to tell
So i´m keeping it moving
I´m keeping it moving",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-kim-2000-lyrics

I wake up in the morning, give thanks for light
Chant a song, meditate on life
Each day, different challenge we endure these fights
Elevate to different levels, we enjoy these heights
Since a young teen learned to use the flow
Some stay stagnant, refuse to grow
The god Rakim told us to know the ledge
Mine change when I decided to grow my dreads
Lock, swing low, show my length
Lot of blood, sweat and pain so you know my strength
Growth and development, my niggas secure
We don't play that dumb shit no more, nigga mature
Still kick it with the core, smoke and drink
Some of y'all I don't involve 'cause you harbor hate
Had to learn to let go, that's serenity's prayer
Still keep my friends close and my enemies near

Made a bad decision, lost my best friend
Took for granted what I had back then
Showed you a part of me you never saw
A person can be rich and be still poor
Damn, can't believe that I did this
In front of the whole world ask for forgiveness
Fail to recognize all the pain I cause
My heart was and always will be all yours
I wish I could make it stop at 1 o'clock
To where you and I was in a better spot
Home boo my demeanor, the grass won't never be greener
And I might not be perfect
But if we work with it, baby, it'll be worth it

Baby, we good, we straight
Ain't much you can do that we can't

Memorial,The Rude Awakening,1998,"Lookin out my window hypnotized by the rain
In a trance reminicing bout the soldiers slain
Fighting wars in the brain trying to maintain
Hoping mama won't have to feel the pain
Looking at a closed casket or a picture frame
Even shorties that you banged won't forget your name
Still feel strange how times do change
We doing our thing and in our minds you remain

As I uncap a 5th of Henny for my soldiers that's a memory
Thinking 'bout the fun times we had together
Blazin' 'till the sunshine
Drinkin' the cheap wine
I know I never find a brethren of the same kind
But at the same time, I'm constantly writin' eulogies
For my big homey locs and my loco g's
Since '73 it seems death followed me to my man ?Tyshan Wells?
Rest in Peace

Oh why oh why oh why
It's always the good ones that have to die
Oh why oh why oh why
Bob Marley die, Jacob Miller die
Oh why oh why oh why
It's always the good ones that have to die
Oh why oh why oh why
Bob Marley die, Jacob Miller die

Another day another burial
Got you wondering 'bout the day when he bury you
Tear drops stain the wally's that you rockin'
On the block candles burn guns popin'

I just came from the cemetery where my dog was buried
Drop some buds in the earth to grow in they memory
Thinkin' 'bout the fun times we had as fam
Remembering the beef we got into but never ran

I seen a kid get ate up by his own man one time
Hid behind a car now look and duck and bust a ?
On some Harlem Nights script
But this some real life shit
Heard his scull split when you seen the slug hit
I watched the vultures swarmin'
Prayin' on his garments
They stay robbin' dead men cuz they don't give 'em problems
Heard the good die young be it by God or gun
Paint my mural on the wall sayin' my job was done

I shed tears when I hear news from my peers
That my nigga Shawn Crady was no longer here
Had me mad at my girl ready to take it to the world
Drinkin' liquor 'till I'm damn near 'bout to 'url
Got a jewel from my dog locked up in jail
Told me son is in the essence resting
All is well
While you still here: accomplish your deads
Cuz you never know when it's your time to leave

Oh why oh why oh why
It's always the good ones that have to die
Oh why oh why oh why
Bob Marley die, Jacob Miller die
Oh why oh why oh why
It's always the good ones that have to die
Oh why oh why oh why
Bob Marley die, Jacob Miller die",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-memorial-lyrics

Many Morroco suffer, many Morroco die
Semi-autos to stutter bucka, bucka, bbucka
Calling popo for cover, rhyming with Cocoa Brovaz
Pure murder since the day of discover
One-of-a-kind never find another

Slide in clubs scutting, whore hunting, start buzzing

You ain't gangster I live by the street code
Been told never let beef grow old, get rid of that
Like prince crime pistols muzzle' em up
Half of a man on the dash, trucks guzzle it up

Got a fiend for the right guard with hands like apes
For the strips from the plate gorilla smack ya face
Rhyme a day no rhyme but it's nine to spray
Keep a safe full of bail money just in case

The routs we take have us on the run from Jake
The rules we break keep us on the move for cake
Niggas can't wait to hate, DJ's dub my plate

The day she pushed me out her womb
And told me Nigga get paid
Stay focused when them obstacles get in your way
Can't let these opportunities keep gettin' away
It gets hard tryn to juggle these responsibilities
But it's a beautiful struggle you can ask Kweli
After the rain falls
See the rainbow in the sky
Auntie passed
See the pain go away when she died
Youngin' looked me in the eyes
Said he can't even cry
Asked him why?
'She in a better place now' he replied
Can't be walking with my face down
Face frown fed up
Bob Marley told me get up
Pac said keep ya head up
Try or fail or fail or try
This ain't about never falling
It's about how ya rise
Can't judge by the surface
It's about what's inside
You only reach a destination if you willing to ride

This ain't no sad song rap
Or a track you relax on
This to help you stand strong
While you getting your cash on
Ain't no looking back now son
Word, we came mad far
Whoever said it's easy living life as a rap star

Twistin up buds, puffin on, bloods, I mean
Always red eye wit an evil schemin mind
Pullin off things wit his partners in crime
Not a care in the world, he's seen plenty sniff riders
Runnin up in spots wit the calico and shotties
Loungin on his strip wit his Timbs and his meth
His right hands man, on his side, to the left
Never leave the drink without packin the burner
Got the streets smart, seen for killin be murdered
It's, no relaxin, just taxin
Stoned Is The Way Of The Walk, when you black and
Supportin habits is gettin too hectic
Gotta kick it wit my son about some ol' Next Shit

Pressures be buildin in my mind sometimes and ways
That have me countin the many reasons why crime pays
I think about the hustlin games, should I maintain
Or flip and di-shift to the fast lane?
We got a mind, but it takes dough to make bread
We workin wit cement try to make bricks
Time to make a call and get on the ball
(Can't front G 'cause we won't be ones to take a fall)
Heads recognize me, so they might supply me
But if they try me, that wouldn't surprise me
But I & I keep eyes open, for those who lie scopin

We can do this for worse or for better
Me and my Partner N Crime, is going thru this together
So, knowin we can't avoid all snakes, we gon' do whatever we gon do
To set this shit straight

Give the left hand, and in response, say hello to my Timberland
Rack emcees up, and I crack emcees up
Pass the owl, so I can twist these trees up

Where you take all your stakes for what it's worth

Step to my biz like so
When I show individuals skills on the battle field
Any muffie test, see we out for call
'cause each and every soldier holds the name of the Camp

I wanted the car, so I got me the car
Don't start, cause no heart is what got me this far
I the type of nigga that don't give a fuck
Just walked up and laughed at the cop
Type of nigga to go up in traffic
And start blastin' the Glock
Rap's still down, see huh, pass me the rocks
I don't be playing it serious
I'm actually looked after he shot
It's no love, for y'all 16 bullets
Four slugs peace, ain't no bigger thugs than me and see

Breeze off it blow, but the enemies are scattered
Hope the end justify the means, it don’t really matter
The people don’t progress, that’s what makes me madder
It’s sadder to see the things I see
Make me be the way I be
Crying for the cheese, crime life and prime time
Supply them with dreams, that’s why we buy the things
But we ain’t feeling the same pains revive in the skin
I’m from the best side, best stuff fly in my’
You know we’re often’ though it’s been a look around
Throw back bones and some cold denims
You see my footsteps, yeah, you wanna walk in ‘em

Seek another round, switch lanes, detour

Face mask, bring truck
Gun it for the payroll

Bucks up, after lock up, buckle up and move!

“One”

There will always be non-believers, I’m sure
For some, it’ll only take one time
For others, it’ll take much more
Who knows what’s in store?

Before I lay my head down to rest, I hit the floor
And do fifty reps for the heads that left
See, equality does me justice
Calisthenics keep me fit to deal with tricks who can’t be trusted
I can never put up with them who front
And even though some I used to run with, they get done with
Don’t come with foreplay ‘cause we deal the raw way
Kill the “he say, she say.”  Check what we say

I’m dwelling in the cellar with my niggas Heltah Skeltah
Loading up the clips with lyrics, punks run for shelter
Smif-N-Wessun’s on the loose with a noose for your neck
You let info slip out, so it’s dead you get
There’s the Black Moon, we creeping up in your room
Death fills the air along with the scent of (*Cough*)
Open your eyes, violators, and greet your fear
Off with the head of a snitch, and he’s outta here
 (x2)
One rhyme for the snitch dropping dime (One time!)
One rhyme for the heads doing time (One time!)
One rhyme for the crooks committing crime (One time!)
One rhyme, one time for your mind

“One”

Sitting in
The pen with my back against the gate, watching these snakes
As I await this next bus heading upstate
New place, same faces from the last joint
Got my banger, so when danger come, I’ll be on-point
In the parallel cell, who mad?  Duke just
Been had by two little shorties who do dirt fast
Juvies do be running wild in this vicinity
Keep an open eye ‘cause now I sleep with the enemy
Ready to thump with any chump with ideas
Nobody move, nobody gets blown from ears to rear

Loosies for sale, two dollars, nothing below
I’m back up in the joint, I’ve been remanded by my P.O
Now behind bars where scars come in pairs
Trooping with my blowers for the unknown that I face in here
Flipping on the rich-ass who got cash
And commissary ‘cause I ain’t going home ‘til Nevuary
Another rejection letter from the head of chief
Now that’s more beef, more weeks I won’t see the streets
Heads know what’s the word ‘cause the grill is blank
Once again, it’s on.  Sucker-type, grab your shanks

One rhyme for the snitch dropping dime (One time!)
One rhyme for the heads doing time (One time!)
One rhyme for the crooks committing crime (One time!)
One rhyme, one time for your mind

Well, I was taught two wrongs don’t make a right, but me and
Rippa been real tight for a while, and everything’s aight
I got one in store for hardcore fanatics
Banging from basement to attic for static if you got dramatics
Who’s the next up for heads up? When my lead’s
Used up, I’ll get my baseball bat, and you’ll get bruised up

Word life, we build on universal mathematics
Don’t deal with the Babbage that tightens up the cabbage
We stalk around like the beast out for prey
Packing the ammo, pulling more juks by the day, taking
Loot with my crimeys, on the run from the coppers
Boot Camp’s on the map, and ain’t no way that you can stop us

Get out
My way!  What?!?  We coming through deep, and my fleet
Packs heat.  Ain’t nothing sweet, we play for keeps.  I got
Money on my mind and my hand on my nine
Gots to get mine ‘cause my life’s on the line.  I
Roll with the Rippa, and the Rippa rolls with me
And my bred-dread D-to-the-O-G

See?
We be hitting up roots spots a lot
In the cypher, getting right with the hoods on the blocks
If you don’t know we, don’t even come in our circle
Mess around and get me vexed, and I’ma hurt you
Soldier boy, front line, one time
As we hit you with a rhyme to elevate your mind

One rhyme for the snitch dropping dime (One time!)
One rhyme for the heads doing time (One time!)
One rhyme for the crooks committing crime (One time!)

Burns they gun, done cheffed up they block
Smokey Lah get what's in the dead rock
We like what fire, when shots fire
You say your eye bust buyin then we aim higher
Never retire, I'mma street cyer
When your ten boys are dead, even more fire

Nigga we all timers, all you niggas are small timers
With alziners, Tek n Steele the lost rhymers
Chart climbers, start drama, spark ganja
Affiliated with deep scholars and street mobsters
New York's an author, Notorious like Big Poppa
Cuz I know killas that'll leave you missing like Hoffa
You cat's are imposters, we show rockers
Cloak poppers, show Glocks off and turn to show stoppers
Chorus: Steele
You rappers can't even hang with me
Can't handle the game like me
Get on the blaze, cuz on the shame and sweat
Do it for days, it ain't no thing for me, nigga
You rappers can't even match with us
Can't handle the track like us
Don't know a man that can stand with us
And no game, you rappers can't handle us

Ain't no motherfuckin thing changed, it's Xun Tsu
The same cat that loved to lick shots at your crew, I'm back
New tactics, new plans, Xun Tsu dented shit like the Son of Sam
It's mask murder, this industry ain't seen nothin yet
We blood thirsty, niggas best protect they neck
Xun Tsu, and my military you get wicked like voodoo
Hittin em up, take two
Never assimilated, I'm not a Blood but affiliated
Weed smoke keeps me stimulated
Who you been with, see my niggas I sent with
It's scared in the same room, next bed shit
Is you bout it, words quotable so don't doubt it
Got soldiers that'll have you moved out and re-routed
My infantry got you runnin like El Nino
For cats that bust nine-millies and quattro cinquos
Chorus 1/2

From New York city, New York
Wearing the red trunks with yellow trim
And weighing in at 120 pounds

Ya try to pull a roll on my eyes, imagine that
I pity the itty and livin the lie
The all I seein, Most gon peep it all in the game
And show mistake made dog, cuz you and two are the same
Never that, now who be the one that spray for the fool
You know the name punk, body up in I.C.U
It's how y'all do, to be hold to feel the wrath of the lord
And little fame god, your soul trapped off in the morgue
Mess around, you thought you was smart but I can forsee
Anythin an imbecile try to hide it to sleep
Believe me, I know the rules and I'm on to you
You smile at me, but I'm hip to the things you do
You feel the flame, and leave a mark symbolizin my name
The Most Talented but known to leave a rapper in pain
You the amateur, try to score a point on the champ
The lone soldier be the Most, run a muck in ya camp

How thug beat can make a nigga muck in his brain

Heard you were fat and light skinned
Tatted wit spins, hands got no wins, but he kept plenty in
Drivin many Benz, his friends is my men's
Tell me what Dirty kick, and how to stick Kim
Make Kim a victim, they know his every slide

I heard he stay up in the wine store, shootin the job
Don't even shoot him to five, just evict all his shines
And lay our version of extortion to him, line by line

But yo, we clearly understand that this ain't no game
No matter how bad you want it, things are never the same
Eater, better or worse from the six to the hearse
Can't forget the Rocky bezel, ante up on the purse
And this verse right here, to whom it concern
Where there's smoke there's fire, if you play you get burned


This is only significant to those militant
If you send against Smif N Wessun, time to repent
We was sent by the streets, wit G.O.D.'s consent
To penetrate the info, shut your regulate and represent
When I enter the game, I had a Nervous squad
Coach put me on the bench, said I didn't play hard
Now it's back to lab, just to get more practice
But door and I relax, a lotta actors turn rappers
Shift the game into fifth gear

Sometimes I sit and think of how it used to be
Reminiscing 'bout when you was introduced to me
We was acting ?? when you and cap came through
It was him you me and ?? and blazin' with cue
When we performed at the intrepid yo that shit was fly
Camouflage suits backstage blowin' a lot
""pass me the liquor""
I never got to tell you my nigga
I was proud when you blew up and made your figures
Who ever said that thugs don't cry?
I never knew my nigga big, or never been out on the block
I know you're hearin' me tell it's like a slug through your bones
That's how I felt on the morning I heared Frank was gone
You know how me and 'sun clicked up that's why our shit was fucked up
When that shit jumped off, but we ain't loose no love
I paid my respects like I should and it hurts

Got deep show decided a nigga never forgot
I love you 'Pac thug blood pumpin our heart
As soon as you touched down, at clinton I got the kite it was official
Niggas screamin' thug life throwin' up their pistols
Ready to start a riot just off G.P
Had to pack you up and put you in I.C.P
Just last week i'd seen juiced it teared my cheek
And Death shit its funny how fast time creeps
You touched the streets, niggas see the points you proved
Dedication, with an outlaw tattoo

You changed the game
Latin, black, white people screamin' your name
Peepin' the slang
Showed love to my peeps when you came
To the video for spanish harlem
You came with no problem
And you made it to stardom
Real soldiers never forgot 'em
I remember that when big twang came through in a white benz
Sittin on some tight rims when you'se gettin right then
We went to his vid' and showed love in return
We threw his burn big pun another friendship was earned
Kicked it at the club poured each other drinks spendin' dough
I was with my soldiers you was deep with your thugs
It was bugged when I heared they murdered Big-L in cold blood
Right before his shit was about to blow up
Still got rambo, troubled world, mikey and field
Indian boy, freky tide you and Big-L
My nigga from uptown where I first met Ken
Take a moment of silence for all of our fans

I was born son of Barbara, sibling of james
Had a twin but he lived for eighteen days
Left his grade of his it's wavy here
One died in ways I ?? fairly here
They said my first word was mother
I'm the eigth of nine brothers
Five sisters, three years behind each other
I'm already thuggin', cursin' squeezin' titties
And I ain't even five yet I'm still a pygmy
Verse 2
I was brought up in the county of kings, first of four
One went to heaven early, natural cause
Only sister that I had passed when I was small
Still hurts, It's kinda hard to discuss with y'all
PS-150 where we used to ball, stick ball, soop hall, we played it all
Brownsville wrecksing where the game be rough
Vandycke, in the hall where my mother gassed him with stalls
Hook
It's like days is shorter nights is gettin' longer
I know whatever don't kill me only makes me stronger
I'm from the ghetto so I know about pain and hunger
Got niggas in the system doing foot for numbers
Just for livin' life they had to sacrifice
So who am I to try to judge n' say it's wrong or right
All that I can do is ball and pray this song is tight
Live the day for those who never made it through the night
Verse 3
St Marks Ave, between vanderbilt and clawson
Ps-9 me and my ree slap boxin'
School yard bully used to rock with little noonies
Big boss killed himself death was introduced to me
Then my brother junior drowns in the pool

Now let's talk about me and my knock out punch
I'm servin' as a teen i'll be back in 18 months
Verse 4
When I was young D sect put me on to the game
It's only one megatron and we reppin' his name
Seth low houses was the place I was raised
From the fourteenth foor the hood looked like a maze
From my room window, I can see the empire state
When My moms cooked fish, I cleaned the entire plate
Seemed like everyday, my pops got on my case
A niggas life wasn't rosy when my mind got strained

Verse 5
High school GQ, not me
It's champ??, black boots, fatigues

What about luck I'm boxing top of my weight
I'm rhymin, doin' college one gotta wait
All of the weight I carry for my nephews and fam'
But the roads that I take make me the man that I am
Verse 6
I heared love lasts forever that's what grandma said

Tryin to get mine, how to commit crime
Only way ma dukes find out is if I get time

Even though I hurt her ma dukes still looked out
Kept me strong ever since she let the seed out

Here's the science, it seem like yesterday to me
H.N.B. robbery, in Manhattan for currency
Sittin up in the crib, drawin out a map
On where security was gon leave the door open at
Park the van around back, the M.P. jet black
We should be in and out 60 seconds flat
So son what's the deal? He ain't takin his route
He rather stay home like a bitch, and have a allaby
What his cut look like, he think he takin half
While we do all the dirt, he sit home on his ass
I got a funny feeling son, somethin just ain't right
Kinda glad I didn't go wit Rum and them that night
And sure enough nigga, you best to believe
Duke snitched under the hot light, like steady people
Wit a vote than a Clinton, Rum and me
Him in cell 2, and me in cell 3
(Chorus: Steele)
Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit
(Tek)
Me off the job would of been easy, if son wouldn't have been greedy
I told him to parle, 'cause he one high jet speedin
Laughin, countin, tryin to play with money he ain't got
No knowledge of himself, and the trigger gave him heart
He just finish biddin, some remote federal prison
D said he was quotin niggas, word to word shittin
To get a light of sense, evedent as I remember
When Dunn Dunn got knocked, I just seen him last summer
At Soul In The Hole, it was a King E. King game
First time out his crib, the kid got body, he got blamed
For being the last one seen, fleein from the scene
Walk was with him up there, he said Duke was held obscene
On some in and out a cell, C.O. slayed him on his mail
His family got banked, he out on 200 foul bail
Myself I don't trust, and that's ya man, so you bust him
'cause every man, know a dead man don't answer questions
(Head Arabic)
It was all love, when push came to shove
I had back, till one kid got clapped
They lock g, for conspiracy, he turn around tryin rattle me, Arabic
I know about this type of shit, snitches do exist
To all my dunns, holdin guns, gettin funds, watch ya self
Thru most of ya crimes by delf

She said she love me, but she took me for granted, when she panic
Flip the whole street, to some shit I couldn't handle it
From my man from up the hill, what the deal?
The block is heatin up, and I need to cop steel
Come and see me, come bring dough 'cause, I can't afford a freebie
And come alone son, 'cause cats know to be snitchin on TV
Be easy, I'm out but my love wanna tease me
Shorty want some attention, not to mention wanna please me
Hold tight, I'll be back in a flash, don't worry
You got money honey, stop actin funny
Out the door, to care of my B.I.Z
And I know this muthaf**kas thats eyein me
Is it a set-up, I peel but I make a detour
And come back, and see my shorty talkin wit the law
I witnessed her trappin bout my business
Where I be goin, who I know in the indus-try
She sex me good, but I should of known

But sometimes the flesh get's weak
And I regret the decision I choose
But I'm not trying to sing the blues
'cause life goes on, remembering the verse
Nitty showed me the song
Kept me calm for a minute though
Got me mellowin Juda blaze the Cocoa
But in the back of my mind I still know
I still got a job to do, for real yo
Give thanks for the meal, it's time to peel though
Lick em off, soon be back to bill yo
On the bricks side where it's real for sho
But what's really buried deep in the mind, no one knows
My peeps keep me grounded, so my head don't blow
It's a struggle but the mo, I smoke the mo, my mind flow
Losin my mind, tryin to stay high
Everybody f**kin wit me, 'cause they know I keep a pound of trees
'cause I gotta maintain in me
But I'm losin my mind, tryin to stay high
Gotta link with my B.N.C

I can't knock him though, 'cause we was once consider peoples

Who motto was ""I die for it"" quote from Stack Money
Head cappo, 'cause shots round the big apple
Ain't never been no punk, my guns bust directly at you
Would of sworn he was the throughest, came threw like the prettiest
Big boy Benz, 500-S series
Dump him for the love of money, by the root of O.J.'s
Bout it to half smoke philly comin out the ash tray
I didn't even know, just knew my man Mr. Brown
And I've been linkin up with dunn for 3 months now
Looked at my kiko asked him, which body cocked thee
Returned to death stair, eye full of blood shot
Try to block it wit a chuckel, hit that shit nigga f**k you
F**k him, pull my coat, just hop up on the dust too
Like it's cool to be smokin on the rulers
Don't hit the spliff, less until you twist the buddhas

It's a shame, it's a shame, how you blamed your man
For some shit that you been through, but you don't understand
It's a price to pay, the price when you play the game
If you get up in the game, get hit up in the game
I seen niggas snitch just to come home quick
Money came home, but he got hit
In the bubble whip, with the system in it
One shot, fire two, then burst
Shit that's what happen when you thrust
You think you comin home, but you meetin chrome
You really thought you had the throne, 'cause you was the bone
On the block, as the bomb rock, now you
Under a rock, so the money stop, gettin
All the rules of the game, so you plan flop

I tell you why the frame won't even think nothin'
Hell fell
Oh, well
I yell
Swear
We gonna send 'em all to hell (X2)
(Professor X)
So you're hesitant
Where a brother quest to represent
I sense no hinder, gender, two-faced intent
In fact, cops signed the last government
Contract
Yeah, umm
So where's your first world war
Now presently on tour
Hardcore
Come on knockin' at your door
Your revolver took down many of '90's lords
Cut to that ad campaign, your gun stores
So they welcome your floor of a tribe called Cocoa",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-off-the-wall-feat-professor-x-of-the-x-clan-and-jan-dan-of-black-hearted-skavengerz-lyrics
Game of Life (feat. F.L.O.W.),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, after Dah Shinin, it all became clear to me
I knew things would be different son
I knew it'd come time for a change
Seems like the time is now
Jah! Rastafarai
Greetings to my soldiers and soldierettes
Jewel on the world, make the earth sink
On the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reachin' for infinity
Can he be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck, they can't function
Caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it to the finish
As the sun heats, I put my feet to the concrete
Hard to sleep so I take it to the streets
Hold my head up, try to keep it movin'
Fed up with losin'
I need some air
I think I take a cruise with you
I'm using, what little know how I posess
To keep our familia down to rest
Now I stress defensive tactics
'Cause police seem active
Got me in the crib sleepin' with heat under the mattress
In case of home intrusion:
First the dogs go ""bark""
Then about five sparks bringin' light to the dark
Like ? does his movement when he's dealin' with math
Or the boss tell his workers where he's keepin' the stash
When that gun blast, better have Jah on your side
Or an act of devine intervention from the most high
I know guys that get a thrill from the kill
And other niggas, who hold the greed to sling ?frills?
Chorus
Demon's tryin' to take my soul away
But they won't get my soul today
Will I get locked up or blown away?
Just stayin' strong is a price to pay
(Repeat)
Damn I haven't worked since I was 'bout 17
They had time busy hangin' out being a drama fiend
I had to run the streets, see what the night brought out
Sneak in the crib
Hear my moms prayin' to God that I sprout
Take all responsibilities like a man would do
'Cause she know that the streets can bring the worst out of you
She told me concentrate on school but what I do about loot?
I wanna push the fat ride, have bitches sweatin' me too
But you know you need dough so you can do the do
And going to class everyday don't bring in no loot
Plus I just been told that I was cold by club bouncers
Standing there hot headed 'bout to set it while they denounce us
Crab niggas still beggin' for CD's
While brothaz' careers is stuck on halt and freeze
About to face extinction ?pockets dead is thinkin'?
Something ain't peace and suicide's part of my thinkin'
Even God don't hear my prayer or him just not care
Got a son in this world, stressed out losin' my hair
Chorus
It's time to take the struggle to the pavement
Let the people know the mayor sent the OK for enslavement
Orders from the government
Official stubborn men with egos runnin' shit
They put the hit out on whoever try to get out
And they are the directors who are dead and ?
Even down south in Atlanta
Police play the pawn for their master
It's a disaster, practicing who can kill us faster
For less than nothin' like they did Bobby Huton
Corruption got me clutchin' my rifle for gun bustin'
Somethin's cookin'
Look at the way some faces be lookin'
Cross the bank rock on to Brooklyn, Texas
Even in Houston P's be shootin' us like sitting ducks in groups
And I can't trust who or what
That will explain the way I watch you, plus
I know the chosen are few
Many come around to proclaim things they know not
Let alone maintain
Shame, some of my worst enemies
Live right around me and look just like me
I see that its time to intensify the movements in front of my eyes
Can't rely on a seeing dog they got me
Or lay and wait for the devil to surprise me, nah G
Chorus (twice)
It only takes a line to make the mind think
Drop a jewel on the world make the earth sink
I'm on the brink of divinity, defying gravity
Reaching for infinity
Plenty be incarcerated by the limits
Stuck they can't function caught up in the scrimage
This game called life only lasts minutes
Once you in it, be in it to win it 'till the finish

Hold It Down (feat. Storm),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Steele)
Hold me down, I'm movin on the enemy now
For a cause, and he cause ya exort at war
I swore to be dedicated, always elevatin, meditatin
Bout the soldiers who couldn't make it
Take shit forever, that's my position, part of my condition
Is to long live the tradition of the stick n move
Get ya tools ready for construction
We prepare to build or destroy somethin
Brooklyn born, I be Steele on the real
And I feel like gettin it on, yo son what's the deal?
For some reason, niggas be fiendin
And when niggas be fiendin, they be quick to commit treason
But I keep breathin through, though the season do
Be seemin to get alot more hot than usual
So, who can I confide in, who can I trust to bust when I'm ridin
I don't need no last minute surprises
From those who pose as friends but they be lyin
I keep my eye on the snitch that's spyin
Plottin to brake down my whole enterprises
Some niggas soft but some niggas define shit
True soldier ready for war, so don't try shit
Why you get critical, 'cause the spots held down by the general
(Chorus 2X)
There's only a few that could ride wit me
There's only a few that could ride for free
I hold my weight plus yours, when you can't hold ya own
'cause I know you do the same for me, so hold me down
(Tek)
Every clique got a soft nigga in it, believe me
That potray a kid he saw on the streets or in the movies
Tryin to do the same he seen on the screen
Got his big guns, Timbs, hoody and his jeans
Talk the fast talk but there's a pause in this walk
Rock his jewels, truck and he still eat pork
He get his little hustle on, he run with his major team
Crazy ass dread from Jamaica, Queens
Ain't never seen war up in his face before
Get his news from the barber shop/beeper store
But if you let him tell it, he's the last man standing
Talkin bout son, I held it down wit the cannon
Should of seen the way that I was blazin at the cats
Twist of the wrist, while I was pattin one back
Like that kid did to Menace, when he had the four pound
You know it's only right, I had to hold the fort down
(Storm)
Blazin wit ya friends, when we ridin
There's no suprisin, it's all good
Takin chances, in the cut every day
Tryin to big up, tryin to big up wit my master plan
(Chorus 2X)
(Steele)
As a youth I would sit up in my room and dream
One day I became wit a ruthless teen
Little did I know that every step I took
Had already been signed and sealed in some books
So I took a look at what I got to work wit of course
And if granted by the source move on wit full force
What choice to choose, if I sin will I use
Sittin wit the reverend in my county blues
(Tek)
To which ever form you base your religion on
Live by the scriptures of the Bible or Karan
Don't burn bridges if you plan to make riches
The ones that you least expect to be the worst snitches
For a dollar, a nigga screamin holla out
Ya secret whereabouts, so they can come and air ya out
And took the throne, down the shoot dead and gone
The struggle goes on, so hold down ya dome
(Chorus 2X)",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-hold-it-down-feat-storm-lyrics
Hellucination (Dub),Hellucination / Home Sweet Home,UnKnown,"Smif-N-Wessun - “Hellucination (Dub)”



Sitting on the toilet, shitting, puffing the dough
Strobe light effect, everything’s moving slow
Slip into a deep zone, the sound of the phone bring me home
Stagger to my feet and motion toward the phone
Ayyo, Rippa, what up, nigga?  Check out this proposition
There’s money to bait, and I’m in the mood to go fishing
Whatever, nigga.  Give me time to wash my ass
My hand been itching all day, fiending for the cash.  Do what you
Gotta do ‘cause I’m on my way in the car
‘Cause when I get there, yo, we audi like tomorrow.  Right
Right, easy.  Now I’m off to the south
To get more info on this dough I heard about
Gotta make sure everything’s secure, can’t
Let me and my man let these Grants slip past our hands
The man’s out heavy today
I hope they don’t try to get in the way of our pay
Damn.  Already high noon, the man’s out
Gotta take a quick shower, get dressed, and bounce
Grabbed the fatigues, strapped on the generals
Proper attire for all criminals
Blazed up the clip, loads up the four-fifth
If a bwoy riff, leave a body, dem stiff
Who the man there gwan rap ‘pon my door?
Disturb me at work.  Only loaded up four.  Ayyo
It’s me.  Who that?  ST.  What up, G?
Aight, hold up, son.  Let me put it back on safety
Ayyo, kid, it smells like fresh grown cess
Let’s twist up some trees ‘fore we jet
True.  You know we keep a fat sack of sensi
Even though you know it make our pockets go empty
Well, all that’s about to be solved in a few minutes
So whenever we finish, we gon’ bag up this spinach
Easier said than done.  Peep the 4-1-1
The dread around the corner just tried to blast Ruck and dun
I knew it.  Bad vibes flowing like fluid
Forget about the dough.  Let’s do this
I see you already strapped, pa
So I’ll meet you outside ‘cause my gat’s back in the car
How far must one go before I throw
His whole entire life right out the window

Tek: Yeah, yo, whatever
Steele: Yo, kid
Tek: We gotta step all up in this.  Now or never, dun
Steele: Niggas don’t recognize, son.  We gotta bring it to ‘em, kid
Tek: No doubt we gotta bring it to ‘em
Steele: Whatever, man.  Bad vibes is definitely in the air, kid
Tek: Yeah
Steele: We gotta let ‘em, nigga, know what time it is
Tek: Let ‘em know?
Steele: It can’t happen like that.  We’re strong
Tek: Let ‘em know, aight
Steele: For real, son
Tek: I’ma let ‘em know

Him a dead bwoy and him don’t even know
Yo, he looks like the dread that hooked us up on the low
What you say, fly?  Thinking out loud just caught me in the zone
I’ll tell you all about it on the way home
Whatever.  I’ma send this nigga to his essence
He’s fucking with the family, know he gotta learn a lesson
And you know he ain’t even yardie, right?
Some bwoy gwan get dead tonight
As we strap on the gloves, feel the buzz from
The cannabis.  Niggas ‘bout to get scandalous

Steele: Ayyo!
Tek: Sup?
Steele: Ayyo, ayyo, that’s that nigga right there, right?!?
Tek: Where, where?!?
Steele: Right up there, right by the store!
Tek: Yeah, that’s his bitch-ass!
Steele: Let that nigga have it, kid!  Hahaha, get him!  Ah yeah, son.  Ah, that’s what I’m talking ‘bout, boy.  Ayyo, what the fuck, what the fuck?!?

Gotta be gone on the double.  I think I seen ‘em
All tumble, but, on the left, there’s trouble (What?!?)
Undercover had this build staked out (Oh shiat!), watching
The whole thing go down.  Yo, it’s time to break out (Come on, son!)
The four-fifth as I shift and drive
‘Cause every man here might not leave alive
Son, why you stalling?  Hop on the ball and
Get us outta here before we be the next fallen
Right now, this whole shit is bugged.  We the thugs
Yet the beast coming up, showing niggas love
Took our burners, gave a dap, let us bounce, now it’s
Back to the Dog House to smoke the next ounce

Tek: Yeah!  Haha!  Yo, yo, chill over there.  These killers are on the set, man!  Why you wilding, son?  Murdered and shot.  Yo, son, that shit is bugged on the real, son
Steele: Yo, where the Owls?  Let me twist something up real quick.  Haha

Who could believe the beast left us alone
And took the chrome that sent one of our own back home?
And not only that kid.  Check how
Money that we just did was that connect for the cash
Them pigs must have had dibs for
The stash.  Now ain’t that some shit for your ass?
Truth say, I never liked his pretty ass anyway
But that shit with the pigs cold made my day
Gave me a whole new outlook on the beast
Even watch for them ones so-called the beast
But, anyway, you know we high right now
Doing it like this, the original crook style

Steele: Original crooks.  Recognize.  Word up.  Anything goes.  Anything goes.  Yo!
Tek: Two times!  Two times for that ass.  Like this and like that.  Smif-N-Wessun, Duck Down, Heltah Skeltah, Originoo Gunn Clappaz in the house",https://genius.com/Smif-n-wessun-hellucination-dub-lyrics
