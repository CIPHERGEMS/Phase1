Hey Ya!,Speakerboxxx / The Love Below,2003.0,"1, 2, 3, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)

Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

Ms. Jackson,Stankonia,2000.0,"Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree,
 
I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

""Look at the way he treats me""
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song;
 
let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you

Aquemini,Aquemini,1998.0,"Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes 'y'
, 
nothin' is for sure
Nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain (y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

Now is the time to get on, like Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirpin', it's a must
Is you on that dust or cornstarch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack man
Pacman,
 
how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Ridin' round Old National on 18's without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga, don't get no wood grain steering wheel
For real, you can go on chill out and still build, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes 'y'
, 
nothin' is for sure
Nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain (y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors and baby ballers
And bowling ball Impalas
 
and street scholars
Majoring in culinary arts, you know, how to work bread
Cheese, and dough from scratch, but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya selling, what you bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge, meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad, need some hope like the words 'maybe'
'if', or 'probably', more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all, I often drift,
 
I'm talking gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed, so what have you?
Now question: is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, Aquemini, another black experience
Okay

Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes 'y'
, 
nothin' is for sure
Nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain (y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know dat, some say we pro-black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust rhyme, we bust back
Get-get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear dat? You can't come near dat, maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and the Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea, yea

My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin—André Ben,
 
welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend my-self so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believin' in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends

Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes 'y'
, 
nothin' is for sure
Nothin' is for certain, nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain (y'all know)

ATLiens,ATLiens,1996.0,"Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
""Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit""
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol, so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""",https://genius.com/Outkast-atliens-lyrics
B.O.B,Stankonia,2000.0,"One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (woo)
Like a million elephants and silverback orangutans
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9, Anno Domini anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—HOT!
Get a life now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ah!

Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout 5 niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but cha copped a dub
Should've held back, but cha threw the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but cha packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl four year, Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, there for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag top
Before you RE-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coals
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""
Like Janet, Planet Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pity pat rappers trying to get to 5
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, high!

Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

Bombs over Baghdad!

You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out here come the folk, ""Damn""
Oh, Lord

As the plot thickens
It gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Olde E, I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set it Off,"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
""Hey hey look baby they playin' our song""
And the crowd goes wild as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality it's only about 3 A.M
And three niggas just don' got hauled
Off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas don' start bustin', ""wham! wham!""
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talkin' 'bout
""Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""
It's just my interpretation of the situation

Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James

Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes (ya dig)
One moment you frequent the booty clubs and
The next four years you & somebody's daughter
Raisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game
And man enough to handle real life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient but the
United Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office
Didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now you back in the trap just that, trapped
Go on and marinate on that for a minute

Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja

Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day,
 
me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'""
That's one to live or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
André, got to her station, here's my destination she got off the bus The conversation lingered in my head for hours
 
took a shower Kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt, went on out and bought it
Cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky
Awfully sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote
 
and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done
 
and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned that crown"", but until then

Ah ha, hush that fuss

Do you wanna bump and slump with us?

Da Art of Storytellin’ (Pt. 1),Aquemini,1999.0,"Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, 'cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player
I'm dickin' the ho down, never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though, maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck; I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too""
She said she understood and everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD, and a fuckin' poster
It's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on
And get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)
It's like that now, it's like that now

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning, yawning, dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain, and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit
We on our back staring at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, ""What you wanna be?"" She said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong (Man)
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

It's like that now, you better go on
And get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now, you better go on
And get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

Elevators (Me & You),ATLiens,1996.0,"One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago, on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

Check it, a-one-two, a-one
""Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,"" they call us
Went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say ""motherfuck that playin'"", they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick, and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone!
Like this, East Point and we gone

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey, man, you remember me from school?""
""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind
Niggas try to get a piece of mine
So I gotta grab my piece

It's the return of the gangster, thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow that run up in your crib
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit

get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that think you soft and say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed
Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin', get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
Seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass
Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?
When y'all gon' break up? When y'all gon' wake up?
Nigga I'm feelin' better than ever what's wrong with you
You get down!

Man, a nigga don't want no trouble
A playa just want to kick back with my gators off
And watch my lil' girl blow bubbles
But still ready to rhyme, standing my ground never back down
Willin' to rob steal and kill any thang that threatens mine
But good luck couldn't be bought, see
Many a fights had to be fought, G
For a nigga to ride these Vogues
Oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
Watch your side my nigga cause we got gats
The first nigga to buck is gon' be the first nigga we attack
Don't want that, but it comes though, most of the time when you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that slow dough
We worked for everything we have and gon' stick up for
Each other, like we brothers from another mother
Kind of like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
Strictly for the Caddy lovers
And never the nut huggin' punk motherfuckers
So quit spreading them rumors
We ain't Club Nouveau

Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, 
so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides

When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and
 
high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

 on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, 
I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham
, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then,
 now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy,
 
chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems
, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
, 
even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank 
thee
, for running that 
Southerplayalistic
 game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name
It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying

See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking

Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine,
 
they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

Picture the scene, these fiends with fire
Ten dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that
I'm wit' whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw
Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back
Twenty over, now that's mo' money to get
Slick, we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught
But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin' (fuck him)
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin'
But I make moves, shake them tricks up out they shoestrings
Be more precise when we do things

Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out

Now you ridin' 'bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale
, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah

I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' ""Hootie Hoo!"" when we see cops
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' ""Hootie Hoo!"" when we see cops

Ay, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs
We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back
'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave

I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' ""Hootie Hoo!"" when we see cops
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty
Gon' represent it to the T-top
Born and bred up on the street top
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollerin' ""Hootie Hoo!"" when we see cops

This is uh… a lil'… tune that we composed back on the first album

"Git Up, Git Out",Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,1994.0,"Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking ""Gimme some,"" living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yo ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool, yeah it's real cool getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha!

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead, cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo!
My White Owls are burning kind of slow

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black running but crac-kers, so, why
I got to register? I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

You need to...
You need to...
You need to...

The Whole World,Big Boi and Dre Present... OutKast,2001.0,"""Okay, here we go...""
Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone, yeah!

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back, y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world...

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah, then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, 'cause

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues

Da Art of Storytellin’ (Pt. 2),Aquemini,1998.0,"""Baby, did you hear that?"" ""Yeah, baby, I heard it too""
Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals
, 
all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, 
guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done
""Who said good folks is not supposed to die?""

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at The Dungeon shortly,
 
ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion
, 
I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

""Who said good folks is not supposed to die?""
All's well, nothing's well
All's well, nothing's well
All's well, nothing's well
All's well, nothing's well
All's well, nothing's well
All's well, nothing's well

Liberation,Aquemini,1998.0,"There's a— there's a— there's a— there's a fine line
It's too late to pray that I'm on it, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yo, yo, uh-huh)
There's a fine line between love and hate, you see
Came way too late but, baby, I'm on it
There's a fine line between love and hate, you see
Came way too late but, baby, I'm on it
Can't worry 'bout what a nigga think, now see
That's liberation and, baby, I want it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation and, baby, I want it

Lemme hear it, lemme hear it, lemme though, lemme hear it
How many times I sit back and contemplate?
I'm fresh off the dank but I'm tellin' my story
My relationship with my folks is give-and-take
And I done took so much, now give me my glory
To have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left up-a to me and my momma n'em told me (Yes, she did)
I say, to have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left up-a to me and my momma n'em told me

No, no, no (Ah)
I'm so tired, it's been so long struggling hopelessly
Seven and forty days (Hey)
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe
To make you believe I'd give my life away
Oh, Lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired (Tired)
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own (Own)
All on my own (Yeah)
We alive but we ain't livin', that's why I'm givin' until it's gone
'Cause I don't wanna be alone (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be alone (Yeah) (No, no, no)
If there's anything I can say to help you find your way
Touch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe we could fly
But I can feel it in the wind, beginning or the end
But people, keep your head to the sky

Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Shake that load off, shake that load off
Folk in your face, you're a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot, now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars, make a million mo'
First class broad treat you like a nigga po'
You wanna say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask
As your world starts spinning and it's moving fast
Tryin' to stay sane is the price of fame
Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds, then you go on home

I must admit, they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine
From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without infanticide
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't think we in Kansas no mo' though
Midwest or Dirty South
Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening
Just by rappin'

13th Floor / Growing Old,ATLiens,1996.0,"Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level—what are we doing?
Fooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand upon this section of time marked Revelations
And recognize this mind-numbing reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of 
Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon

Like memories of yesterday
""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...
""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...
""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...
""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...

I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata
, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts

Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat,
 
but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'

Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

Our dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

Like some eagles,
 
people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches
'Cause you flauging; falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old

Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turn my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday

See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old
See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow-brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old
See all them leaves must fall down, growing old

Babylon,ATLiens,1996.0,"I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocaine powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard
While we ranting and raving 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you, in you

I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused
'Scuse me, Lord lustful thinking
But that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods
And laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be
Exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on
Until we felt excited then, aaaah
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere
If you know what I'm talking about
Now if too harsh then walk on out
And I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny
Because it's devilish
Now see, we dead wrong

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you, in you

People don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay
Saw her last that she lay
Give it another day, I say
But the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, lawd
'Cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth
Before a nigga like daddy was born
But they be making it seem
That my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean
My lyrics ain't clean

Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, my faith in you, my faith in you
My faith in you, my faith in you, my faith in you, my faith in you

One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other, and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party, women jump for joy

Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow

Two Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac),ATLiens,1996.0,"Greetings, earthlings

From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Post slums
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac

This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged André to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding
I say, ""Look, boy, I ain't for that fuck shit—so fuck this""
""Let me explain 'only child' style so you don't dis'""
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments

Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Post slums
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac

It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to the Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here
We cutting the fool now
I'm doing ya at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop

Yeah, tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing wit Queens in my castle—ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying ""We'll rap for food""
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out cause this be a freestyle

Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop–

Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,1994.0,"Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothing to see

My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise yo' block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–ten
Stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ""ho,"" and knock 'em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house like... a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Well, Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all day and day, be rolling like that today, hoe
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seeming
That I'm glistening, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side, full of pride
Now ain't that something?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches, Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, OutKast, Southernplayalistic

It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now, players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it

You want me to lolligag and talk that bullshit?
I refuse to play so I'm gon' speak that Southern good shit
That harder than yo' hood shit, lil' shit
That make y'all niggas think about the trigger
Before you pull it, on liquor stores and banks
Them folks got more than enough bullets to put that ass
Off in the slang, don't claim no gang, we the niggas

Pump my breasts up, can you suck the fat up

Tell his mamma not to cry

Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac
Ah suki, suki, all day, e'rr day, any day, every damn day
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a crumb of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki, Magic City and them Southern playas
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make

But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light? (Hootie Hoo)
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, we macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did

No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you

Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua, how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you, she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do -- you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, ""Bitch don't ever disrespect me, never not at all""

Maybe make sho' that's my seed
Quiet nights like this, bachelor like me is single
Talkin to you Miss Bilingual
Let's mingle in the crowd, watch them show, pop some Moet
Tryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain
Never been a lame, horny, ever since I been a tiny
Fuckin with niggas with ageless bodies
Talkin to me, while I squeeze it bare
Let me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair

Better get in where you fit in cause it's crucial
I'm tryin to cut bout two of them girls
Cause that just what I'm used to

The first that look my way just gon' get splack packed
From the front to the back

Everybody cheesin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
Like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies
So I checked her, like the king I am, no disrespect intended
Told her, and her silly friends
""Get out"" before they got offended
To the La Quinta we went, layin them hoes down
On the freestyle tip, geyeah!

Niggas in the point ain't changed
Yeah...


A nigga ready from the get-go (Blaow, blaow, blaow)
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo' punk ass come out to play?
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with, you's better off
Dead is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets fly, niggas die
By getting blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw, I take that back, that's my problem
Turning and walking away
This ain't gon' work when they be robbing
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Step up, nigga, if you want some

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

Well, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead 'cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
My nine be doing fine until these niggas wants to clear me
Off my street, but in my hood-hood, they hollering ghetto
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew
On the concrete, remember when we ran deep?
Remember at the party when we served them niggas dandy?
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is in the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
Quick to dodge danger, I'm taking it one day
At a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just to let you know, yeah

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane

It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this, a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See, I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?
You 'posed to be the quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets, letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah, that's how I do
You know that's how I do, you know that's how I do

Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We's having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
It's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo' chest (It's the joint)

Yeah, and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas

[Verse 1: Big Boi + 
André 3000

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
'Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute
We don't contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
[Verse 2: Big Boi + 
André 3000

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies
Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

Okay, like this, yes, yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times, too legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop

West Savannah,Aquemini,1998.0,"Yeah, I’m back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme, about where my roots at
Yeah, Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it…

February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects
Changin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm moving in slow motion, boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string
'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, man
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)
Now, now, now, nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(and it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?

The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga 'round me playing married, or paying child support
I can't cope, never made no sense to me one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids
Woe woe, the world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance
Now time to dig, low low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up
You with me say shit, sho sho

On a first offense drug bust, fuck the Holice
That's if ya racist or ya crooked
Arrest me for this dope I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm outta your jurisdiction now ya lookin' stupid
Officer, get off us, sir
Don't make me call L.A. he'll have ya walking sir
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage we scream
Don't everybody, everybody

The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

Officer of the most high
You touch me you touch the apple of his eye
If they kick us out, where will we go?
Not to Africa cause not one of them acknowledge us as their kin folk
Still eatin' pork
Abomination desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker
 
on Judgement Day
Hip Hip Hooray!

The mother of harlots is falling

Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this
Planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame

By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear,

Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy

Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like hammers home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
Oh, but you right if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda, you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term,
 I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
Make a movie of our lifestyle, but they earn
Like a dead body burned on the mantle piece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane -

But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne

But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

Yeah, Yeah
A is for Adamsville
B is boing home
See if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention, I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourth of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird

(Starts off)
Tenth grade, the way was paved for me and Dre to create
Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make ah a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two the sequel all new 'Kast
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name behind that screen name
They're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen
(Nigga please)
But even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting

Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce

I do, love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, it's game time
Do you take this here as your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her for all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share and take you there
And me and you together baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me like a game of football
Used to feed me, need me, dress me
Now it's so messy straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang",https://genius.com/Outkast-hollywood-divorce-lyrics

I met a critic, I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said ""Oh hell naw!"", but yet it's that too
You can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it, whoo
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision, the decision
Is do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes every day, so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

I'm wild, just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day, it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays, until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life (Ahhhh)
And that's life and that's life

Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams
Y'all can't harm me, it's over

Mainstream,ATLiens,1996.0,"(Water splash)
Uh, y'all know what it is
Uh, y'all know what it is
Uh, y'all know what it is

Revolutionary, scary
Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a change I don't feel but I see
Visions from me at 23
Making it free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it 'til I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade
I know it's through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing
Fatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes it's just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming ""catch of the day"" when the recipe calls for ""blackened""
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

I let you stay in my crib
Now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal
Look at the hand you deal
Me crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process sm-m-moking like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to attain another level of conscience
Only to test, the potency
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
Deceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say
""I wish I never did what I did,"" now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10
They got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream
Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream

Millennium,ATLiens,1996.0,"Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse, but now I'm pacin'
 back and forth
Inside, I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on

my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say ""amen""
I hope He understands I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say ""forget it""

Wiping away your germs and filling your craniums with juices
See, Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong, 'cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, 
""I'm proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white, not black""
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we fallin' apart
You lookin' me in my eye, but you ain't feelin' me in your heart
Yes, yes, Lord, give me the power, we live in the final hour

Don't lie you love them
If you don't you like them hoes a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin', turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes, be dumpin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'

Look here say, I'm Mr. Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
Call me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it
I'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan
I slow it down, she like it - speed it up
She poked it out, I beat it up like that
Hit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary

Yeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty cause I was ready to dip
Sweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
Left her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye
Her face wrinkle up and froze
Why you leavin' so soon, supposed to
And ain't no question about that
They call me Big Gipp on the southside
Mr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word
Don't fall in love with good pussy off the top
Better leave for two months come back and pop, ""study the shit""

Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show soldier ass niggas
I'm murder city's Sargeant Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
The pussy wrecker and White Water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to never swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
And creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Niggas know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggas need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta clique
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke, cook it crack, saran wrap it
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
Killer Mike, nigga!

Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to

I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin' speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, cause you hate
Punk pussy ass bitch, game over, who want some?!

Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus
Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talkin' about
Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches
Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening

Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to

Ample time to do this, have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood,
 
the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less, bet' be ready
When they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest and
You's gone, up outta here for good

So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them thangs, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to dat
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em

 diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page
Ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets
Like them freaks be spreading cooties

Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping
It's simply marvelous, time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit, so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa weed reefer, yeah, smoke shit
It's all day e'ery day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world, peace

We is gonna smoke out until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be buryin'
Coming around my shop with that, see, nigga, you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting, I be having your posse ducking
Nothing but King Shit, I am asking, sucka, can you hang?
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle, motherfucker, don't be crying on me
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chillin' in peace, yeah

Slum Beautiful,Stankonia,2000.0,"Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darling you make me lose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where I had to give your mama a call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

Luscious Left Foot
What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe Lady Luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging
And I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you
Cause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues
Slum beautiful you's the world to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm loving the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the God above
Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that God made you for
Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion
Forever's gonna be so fun

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of Now & Laters cause you're the sweetest thing on my head
And I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you
And if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison",https://genius.com/Outkast-slum-beautiful-lyrics
Y’All Scared,Aquemini,1998.0,"Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a ho, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my Southwest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared
If you scared, say you scared

Who's scared?
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been lookin for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
If you scared, say you scared

Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope—hint, hint
At age fifteen they start smokin' Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey, hey, hey, what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
'Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it
Rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it
If you scared, say you scared

February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all thought, bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie—we kinfolk
Nigga, it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
'Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared, say you scared, 'cause everybody can die tonight
'Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone, like Marilyn Manson
You can't hush me, yeah

Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine
I go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fuckin' men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin' up shop, we already established
You lap doggin', we boss hoggin
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin', high heels clickin'
Paper champions, leavin' with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckas, think I got they package
But they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl.. *repeats*
The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo-B
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
Stop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper
We get this shit together our power's in numbers

I say ""What?"" ""Big Time got popped in his Benzo!""
I said ""Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm 'bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell 'em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talkin' 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry 'bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in...naaah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
'Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the 'great ho 'round up yo' money' time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry 'bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over til' that big girl from Decatur sang""
(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Point police don't know a damn thang...)

Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways
, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'
Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping
It ain't over (why that? why that?) 'til the bitch open her mouth up
And sang

Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

Ball if you want to, but do it with some class G
Ask me, do OutKast got some flows so you can blast me
Nasty, niggas on the point they see you shining
Engineers in the studio see me rhyming
Don't get me wrong, got four albums; stay consisent
You got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit
Twist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat
Cap, cap, ya link snapped, you slumped off in ya Cadillac
For what though, some diamonds and a Bentley
What you dying for?
Alright hoe, I'mma bank my cheese and let my mic glow
Prioritize to live to tell these other niggas how you
Bought yo' kid some tennis shoes
Let these brothers know that your mama she got her house too
Let these niggas know that your sister wouldn't have finished
College.. without you,
 
I doubt you do that though
So do this here and keep that bullshit out of our ear
You too near me to not hear me,
 
to open to conceal me
The love for the music keeping Big Boi spittin' real G

Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they gonna put one in your helmet
Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got (Good God!)
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet (Good God!)

We got this nigga now
Yo T, I got a nigga right for us
I'ma take him to the hotel
You know how it's gon go...

Yeah, we got him now...""

How can you measure a nigga by multiple figures
He may got, got, got
Had he not purchased the newest Mercedes
That lose it's value soon as you drive that bitch off the lot, lot, lot
Would he still be the ladies, most wanted, doggonit you want it
He got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town
Had he not played it so flashy, ashy when half of these niggas
Hurtin' and workin' would be he be found, found, found
In a ho (ho) tel (tel) room (room) shot up (shot up)
With his dick shoved in something he got a lot of
Bill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face
Of peasants when he Microsoftening the place
You gettin on my nerves, well I'm gettin on your case
Consider your surroundings or you leave without a trace

Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they gonna put one in your helmet
Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet

Little did he know that, waitin in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done
Done was the one who came in contact
With those with slow goals who prone to sell crack
On his megaphone, ""hey look world I'm on"" you off
He floss hard cause he celebrate the fact

Little did he know that, waitin in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done

Too much for her little mind to bear
And that type of news to her Mama she cannot spare

Damn we miss you, Toilet Tisha

Don't you dare go away from me, girl—I can help you
Don't go away dont you dare leave
Don't go away, it ain't a thang
Don't go away

Five thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose

When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre

Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?

But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cute short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it was something I couldn't explain

It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit, we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V
Extraterrestrial - straight from ATL

Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring
Extraterrestrial, out of this world

Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?

Wailin’,ATLiens,1996.0,"In the zone like Keyser Söze, always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride, I'd be, checking my fucking head
Scared, looking up in your face, boy, I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies
 in the P's, freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo
, 
flows on like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never baking, rebuking Satan
, 
we had you waiting
For the Second Coming, funny how time flies when you're rhyming
LaFace Records,
 I think they got that perfect timing
To be doper than Saddam, believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
Huh, OJ, not guilty, that's how they found he

Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah, mmm, mmm

I felt the pressure like sun shining, while raining
At the same time, I kept on rhyming, not complaining
Storm braining cats and dogs,
 
my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people,
 
who caboose my locomotive
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift, suppose if
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose, won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy, then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fucking guts, go 'head and dap me
'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway
And then go home and pray for your ass later
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailing on you traitors

Myintrotoletuknow,Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,1994.0,"Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the days when we was slaves I bet we was some cool ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out, or even pull your fucking heater
To make his whole crew believers, you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like King Shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I be saying Lakewood
You better be strapped cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's aight though, cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that dime

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime
If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

Time is slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickel sacks crawl
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A., nigga, ain't no changing us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fire shit, yo niggas gonna always toke
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm slanging it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fucking mouth

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime",https://genius.com/Outkast-myintrotoletuknow-lyrics

I just wanna make love to the whole globe
And all her girlfriends
Now don't that make ya mind move
Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit' a bomb
Nam-viet, Viet or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win
Now won't that make us all fools, like class clowns
Praying Private Ryan comes 'round
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it, hurry
When niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?)
Apparently not, that's why you get what you got
Now answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think I'm finna vom'?
You move it like you mean it, she'll come
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day, play is no longer
The feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

Look at the way you look at me, I see it on your face
All your hate emanates, but you still hesitate
'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that, I see the way you were
See the way you smirk
I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXL—you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dré, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car—why you frozen?
Pop the tape in ignite the explosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

With a one-two punch, B-Real and André drop they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear
Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace, but then explode like booty traps

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade

Deeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues
Deeper than sea fish in the O(cean)
I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guards
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching plagues
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your muthafucking spine
No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Me be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end
Andre Ben' slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts

Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way
So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it
Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody
I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, so I'mma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple how we get so D.E.E.P

No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be trying to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having funds
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I gets a little backup
Please don't let them Dixie muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we equal
Whenever the fuck our record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that

I'm getting deeper than that prostitutes vagina
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggas try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, like that, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L

Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question ""Should we take that bullshit from them people?""
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Don't flex, I'm next, I break necks too
Rolling with OutKast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kicking it
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's simply how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me

Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throw in a few more logs, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot is something wicked
But you can't feel it, stick it up your monkey ass
I could let shit ride in the past, now it's time to blast that ass
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go no holds barred
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Uncaged, Parkay
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...

In Chappell Forest, it's gettin horrid

Sayin' 'Hey, baby'

Baby, you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
We bringin' the church back to their feet
So wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby
Say wait, baby
Don't leave me, baby

We make a musical masterpiece

Stankonia (Stanklove),Stankonia,2000.0,"What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity
With its own lusts, its own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nerves
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of the persona, making love after making love
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia

Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void

Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow

The damsels in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right

Thinkin' the police gon' pull me over with this herb off in my ride
So I hide the brick of weed, under the arm rest, under the leather
And thinkin' of startin' ways to make my life a little bit better
Than the dope peddler
Never to pay no fucking taxes
Takin' a chunk up out of my checks and makin' my rhymes just look like practice
Buying clothing, Range Roving with my folks
Don't speak about the Dirty South, my crew ain't bout no jokes
I know some people don't like the way we flow because they envy
They talkin' about they fucked my hoes and that they could have been me
You lookin' to be the butterfly, without the caterpillar
Take your time and do it right cause you gon' make it, I swear my nigga
Or collapse one, fallin' a victim to your greed, boi
You're lookin' to be Big Willie, but you're still a seed, boi
The information in my skull be pokin' some of y'all on the shoulder
But on the other side of the fence, they got y'all niggas breakin' boulders
For quick money

Strugglin's just a part of my day
Many obstacles have been placed in my way
I know the only reason that I make it through
Is because I never stop believing in you
Some people wonder why we here in the first place
They can't believe 'cause they ain't never seen your face
But even when you pray, the next day you gotta try
Can't wait for nobody to come down out the sky
You've got to realize that the world's a test
You can only do your best and let Him do the rest
You've got your life, and got your health
So quit procrastinating and push it yourself

To make a difference 'fore this motherfucker up and blow
In pieces

Only when shit is going bad, you want to holla Jesus
Fuck a pledge allegiance, they got my knuckles bleedin'
From crawling
Got these niggas thinkin' they really ballin'

Don't take my word, there's niggas off in prison
That will tell you
That's locked up for long time and won't sell you no flex

Claimin’ True,Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,1994.0,"Well it is I, the pimp player nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit
I studied 
The Mack
 and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

OutKast, pronounced outcast
Adjective meaning homeless, or unaccepted in society

Are you an OutKast?
If you understand and feel the basic principles and
Fundamental truths contained within this music, you probably are
If you think it's all about pimpin' hoes and slamming Cadillac do's
You probably a cracker, or a nigga that think he a cracker
Or maybe just don't understand
An OutKast is someone who is not considered to be part of the normal world
He is looked at differently
He is not accepted because of his clothes, his hair
His occupation, his beliefs or his skin color
Now look at yourself, are you an OutKast?  I know I am
As a matter of fact, fuck being anything else
It's only so much time left in this crazy world
Wake up niggas and realize what's going on around you

Tampering of cigarettes

I'm pissin' up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave, that cracker was foul

Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?
As long, as I got this legally
People see that we can be on top of things without causin' another nigga sorrow
I know it seems it ain't enough to go around
But keep on holdin' on like Goodie Mob 'cause it's a better day tomorrow
That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you
For your ride, fuck your pride, hide better be out your seat
Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed

Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts

Gettin deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on the session 'cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that getting a Benz is out of the question
The world is yelling Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
Gum and lint, to sum the shit, up, I'm broke
Nothin' but hope, so Big Boi, tell 'em what you toke

And thinkin' of startin' the ways to get that motherfucker crunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin' and chokin' them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggas survive and the weak niggas they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stopped eatin' at pig stys
Be activatin that Lo-Jack 'cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
'Cause it's like this

Either want a Benz or a Beamer

I got these thoughts, similar to the ones in Call of the Wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin' about a hundred miles
The world is FUCKED UP how these niggas be driving drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the car does not belong, I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin' spree, look at me, W-M-B backwards
Takin' you to the chop shop with these verses
Comin' around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must resist
You'll be needin' a physical therapist, 'cause you can't fuck with this

While you sat down by the seashore thinkin' about some seashells
I was around the corner from Pleasant Hill thinkin' about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packing my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem, I'm just breaking the steering column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parking lot
I'm hearin' a voice in the back of my head yellin ""Andre stop!""
But do I stop, naw, I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin' down 'cause the folks wanna run up

Now, everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
Or fall victim, I will overcome
Any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort, so make it last
For the risk you took, trick, you shook your ass
For some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void

Wanda went and bought a Honda, now she's out of a job

She got the trick's watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the nightstand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget, you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion

Funkin’ Around,Big Boi and Dre Present... OutKast,2001.0,"Hello, well good evening, ladies and gentlemen
What we like to do right here—well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of André 3000, right?
And we come from a little place called like Stankonia, Georgia, right?
You know, right now everybody wants to be from space
And like want to be from the country and everything like that
You know, like, really, like, the South
It's like cool to be from the South right about now
Girls, listen up

Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
I'm out here knowin' hip-hop is dead
The average nigga on my corner yellin'
""What the fuck you mean-mean?""
See, we ain't even seen the mountaintop
Counterclockwise goes the neighborhood
Hand-me-downs and canned goods
Won't cut the Grey Poupon
We got to make you run, back to the drawing board
Can't afford to lose, y'all make me yawn
1/1/91... my teacher sees potential in me, said, ""Sit down, son""
And let me tell you like I heard it when I felt deserted
It wasn't no other way to word it, got my feelings murdered
By the bullet of bad, the singer of sad
Songs to make you long for your mom and your dad
Plaid clash with polka dots, I hope you ain't mad
Back up, little mama, I'm about to react

Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah

People have ya party, but please don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Hey sexy mama, there's no time to waste
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate
Grab your partner, roll around, and feel the sound, ah baby
People have ya party, and don't be late
It's time to bounce, rock, roller-skate
Bounce, rock, roller-skate

While Scotty is beamin', lil' Pookie 'nem schemin'
What's the use of living, my nigga?
While you snoozing, I'm dreamin', I'm Tylenol PM
You amount to the same thing every day like per diem
Never tryin' to be nothing but a damn ""What you're being""
One nation under the cool should be the rule
Whether young man or young lady begins or starts grade school
Silence before violence
Nine times out of ten times, the quietest is the livest
Fumblin' through your privates
Daddy Fat Sax, can they have your back? Naw!
Ooh! You're such a playa
Ooh! Your Southern drawl got me sprawled out
In your black book, my name was crossed out
Went from starting to second-string, now in the doghouse (Woof!)
Reminiscing, the party you was missing
Instead of arguments, you think about the hugs and kisses
If this is something hard for you to take
You better bounce, rock, roller-skate

Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah
No, you don't want to see me clown, ah-ah
No, tomorrow sounds like right now, ah-ah
Yup, we ain't just funkin' around, ah-ah",https://genius.com/Outkast-funkin-around-lyrics

La, la-la, la-la, whoo, whoo

You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else

Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party

I am all that you'll ever need
I trip on how everybody see's what I am but you
I thought you'd be brave enough to taste my bitch's brew
Well I thought I was dealing with a man, but you're a boy
You're a boy, you're a boy
I can give you everything you want, but I can't be your toy
Oh no, oh no!

Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America...
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Got nerves like kryptonite
Superman couldn't bend those
Kindness kills callous

From A-Town to Dallas movin' cool

Of cherries, but it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975, never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Tryna find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go, I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books; let's stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good; you enter my hood, you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone, y'all remember this
What we stood for: ""Fuck that fame and that glitz""
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
And got to be more careful, know what corners you be bending
Revelations, getting impatient, and now, I'm dead
Remember what I said; I'm gone, bow your heads",https://genius.com/Outkast-chronomentrophobia-lyrics

Which, by the way, is the home of the Atlanta Hawks, the Braves, and the Falcons

Which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag

And is the home of LaFace Records

Player’s Ball (Original) “Christmas Day”,Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,1993.0,"Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

""It's beginnin' to look a lot like"" what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, 
so shut up that, nonsense about some ""Silent Night""
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all Deck the Halls?
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, on Christmas Day

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides

Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger couple of kids in minivans
Standin in the stands like a fan watch her little man
Run ball... And everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had her cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the (hide) the spouse in the house
Boy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker shit gotdamn asshole)
Took my shit (Too Short sample: Beeitch!) FUCK!

Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids

Just stay strong and be a friend

It was the night that they done dipped and all throughout the palace
That didn't do his part heartbroke or no more marriage
When it happens you'll be slappin yourself rememberin
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid see she was grinnin' and spendin'
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate
Friction wishin I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn... fuckin around

Stages in life no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around cause you know
That I'm tryna change but its hard cause I've been this way

It's good to have y'all back now

Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Welcome to my life, I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with
Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton
 
if you know 'bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite, that means I can't be hurt
(Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I got to go...)

It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
So high up in the sky
I can fly, I fly, I fly, so high

Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(Know we been through a lot, and I ain't perfect
But I swear to you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Surely as truth remains
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)

And now it's time to say goodbye, they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga Big still hit the stage by hisself and still rock
Cus when your faith is in the right place, see, he ain't gon' let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy, stop!!

Before you say you can't hit goal
Please, no excuse this time, don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go
(I can take it from here, ladies; y'all done a good deed tonight)

Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see my nigga went to do a little acting
Now that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip drip drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks - thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in a bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine
You driving me out my mind (out of my mind)
Out my mind, ooooh baby
If I could I would just be with you baby
Oooh cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, whoo!

I like the way you move
I like the way you move wooo

I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move wooo

I love the way, I love the way

But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling

Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?

Land of a Million Drums,Scooby Doo Soundtrack,2002.0,"In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

In the land of a million drums
I catch a pattern that spit rings around you like Saturn
Intergalatic tracks I make 'em like magstrulium
This one for scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
Only you clean over
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm tryin to told ya
We fathers with seeds of our own
We're talkin about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones
Now that the theory gone wrong
An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold
Shaggy pass the boombastic
Daphne said don't do that
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic
Now Scrappy wanna box and throw them bows
So I had to sic the pitbull on him before he could pass one blow
Scooby-doo, scooby-doo, scooby damn doo, scooby doo (Scooby doobie doo)

In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

Woke up from a long night of hanging out with Shaggy
Oh no, lost my last baggy of scoobie snackies
Shaggy, wake up, we've been had
Our Scooby snacks, they got the whole stash
He said, ""Who, who?""
I don't have a clue
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scoobie Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail
In the meantime, I'ma call Velma to tell her
To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash trying to get our stash back
Rounding up suspects, collection' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby Doo when you need him?
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

Break it down, break it down baby 'til the flow jumps off the ground
Ooo break it down lookin' over yonder til the walls come tumblin down
Ooo, yes lord y'ain't gotta tell me two times but you know I know
Ooo, break it down, break it down baby 'cuz I want y'all all to know
We rock the world

In the land of a million drums
There is always something going on, on, on, on
If you can't locate your thought off
Might as well go on take your dead home, home, home, home

I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddlin kids

They K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow, first came he love
Now, then comes the marriage
1, 1, 1, baby, 2, baby, 3, baby carriage, baby

Welcome to my world oceans vs. mountains
(Welcome to her world oceans versus mountains)
Call me the poor girl cause I love to fight them
(Call her the poor girl cause she loves to fight them)
But I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
Deep down my heart riles around
Like a bone lost deep inside
See I'd like to fall in love but
Not that type of guy
Ooh-wee, you got my clouds on fire
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
Remember kissin' on Broadway, you and I
I was bein' your baby and tickin' your tock and yo' clock
See we done jumped the broom and now you know I'm good
And I was dreamin' bout children Emily and
Oh darling baby with the daddy's eyes
And it meant so much to me (it meant so much to me)
And I needed your good love
Baby how could you just go and
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
I needed you, you know
But when the love is gone it's time to go

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up til 3 o'clock in the morning
While you party up til the dawning
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
Darlin', ain't no feelin' left it's just the killin'
Oh... just grab my gun and let's go out
Just grab my gun and let's go out
It ain't no room for love it's just this burnin'
Got me reelin'
Call the law and hold the applause
Call the law and hold the applause

Oh, baby, it's mo', baby, it's workin' on the 6
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like ""boohoo"" then ""boo"" ""fuck you"" and ""fuck you too""
(Fuckin' bitch)
Kids cover them ears
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take
Actually I want the cake and eat it too and plus yo plate
But wait now.. Don't you get the house kids cars
Everything we built together was ours now it's all yours
Thats hard... It's all yours... Good God!

If you don't think I mean it
Then you'll feel it when I'm gone
I said I'm done enough of your love
I said I'm done enough of your love
I'm up til 3 o'clock in the morning

But the birds are gone
Zora, is that a pistol?
With they sad songs
What you fin' to do wit' that?

C'mon, baby—put the gun down
But they might be wrong
Shittin' me!
I really wish you could change, baby
Well if my best ain't good enough, I don't know what to tell ya
Reclaim your throne
I'm the king of this castle
Down here in the darkness
C'mon, baby—hold up!

They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane

Soul is 'Delfonic' then they'll blow your mind
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war
No idea what we in for
Powerful magnificent and so divine
Soul is 'Delfonic' it'll blow your mind

Hear a thunderous voice
Shouting there will be no peace
Until our people rejoice
When every boy and girl is freed
You see it's going down
The wars and the mysteries
But my friends there'll be better days
And a better way

It would be so nice
To hook up in paradise
By all means we must go

I know you've got pizzazz
Every man wanna kiss yo'...

Sometimes I'm just a clown
And everybody puts me down
I guess I'll come around

Tell me what's a man to do
To get close to you
I'm just a lonely fool
When I look in your eyes

Don't tell me no this time
If you do, it'll blow my mind
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
It's an awful thing

I guess it's time to say goodbye
But I gotta give it one more try
I'm only satisfied

Ooh, please come home with me
Ooh, don't you wanna marry me?

All cats pursuing, kinda wild, it's Idlewild

And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection

Phobia,Higher Learning (Music From the Motion Picture) ,1995.0,"The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle
Of the night and somebody in yo room
Your heart starts beating so fast, you can hear it pumping
The veins in your temples pulsate as you stare at the intruder
Then after a few minutes, you realize he ain't moving
So finally you let 'em hang and turn on the light
And the killer turns into your coat throwed over the chair
The feeling of sitting at the red light early in the morning
And two or three motherfuckers cross the street
Your senses heighten, reflexes sharpen, vision's enhanced Adrenaline flows
As they rush across the street, you leave the print from the heater grip in your palm
Then your heart rate and breathing drag back to normal as you realize these niggas just going to the store
Many of us mistake phobia for true fear
Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation
Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence
Through stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification, they'll turn your fear switch to a permanent on We can change this by changing the small truth within the lie
Death is a small price to pay for respect
Death is a small price to pay for respect
You know who it is; you know what it is
Peace out

In these troubling times, a nigga like me be thinking of rhymes
That makes my quarters, nickels, plus my pennies and my dimes stack
Don't be looking for trouble, it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes sir, guess the light is getting dim
At the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
I never thought thirty spokes could attract so much attention
I gotta protect my own therefore I'm heated just like a kitchen
Full of pots and pan, Glock's in hand
Shots, rung out like ringin' the bells
And then that sucker nigga ran
Damn, I never thought that it would come to this conclusion
The folks that throwed us on them boats should be the one's I'm bruisin'
But naw, we don't see it that way
In '94 this is the real, it ain't no time for play play
Better believe the playas on the loose
Need to get they head screwed on tight
When it really get down to the nitty grit, who gon' fight?
Pipe, down
'Cause ain't no better time to crank it up than right now
We gots the Seagram crunk down here
And I don't hear nobody disagreeing
Orga-no-i-z-e, Mr. D.J. and me and Big Boi

So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob

See why in the muthafuck, do niggas be acting up
Do they want me to grab my shit and be lettin' that pistol go buck?
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff
Havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout
That's not what it's about
See yes indeed I got that weed like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces
That nigga the B-I-G be chokin' 'em out  and then I bounces
I got that lyrical flow to make a ho pull up her skirt
I drunk that Erk & Jerk, boi, thinkin' of future things to work on
I got my fuck on and then I took my clothes off
Washed my nuts up in the sink and then I got more nuts off
Cough, it's time to be out, sees bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp
I'm dirtier than the shit on the back of a shrimp
Now ain't that foul the way a nigga can spit that style
My nigga, I spit it, I did it, y'all suckas need to quit it
'Cause it's real

So don't spend your whole life

See, living up in the Dungeon where we stayed in '93
See, that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, yee
And when we rock it, niggas be jocking just like jock itch
You snitch, I fucked your bitch

On the Southside of Campbellton Road
No slippin' in this pimpin', she was just a horny toad
See, I'm a mystery like the killing of Michael Jordan's father
Was steadily clockin' the hoes when I worked at Foot Locker
I'm gettin' higher than learning
Smokin' 'em up and then burning
East Point is on the map and now I close the curtains

Now shit done got boring ass
Molin' when XS closed down
But niggas kept soarin', steerin'
Stirrin', being the pharm assistant that missed
Other folks but some people tend to joke about this
But it's really dead serious
You can bet my lyrics
Now ya wonder why that we done stopped and got curious
Wanting to know where I'm from and where I need to be
Now that I know comfortable living give me meat
Can I get that; ya wonder why we split back
Lure us into pitch black dark
But I sit back and spark another one
To leave ya discombobulated in that dust
Living in a world where in nobody do you trust
Then hustlin' became a major trade, but...
Us in major trouble 'cause we made, uh...
Too many mistakes off in the past
Thinkin' you could make it this world and now we laugh
'Cause it's all false
Either way ya go, ya gotta pay the cost...

So don't spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, I will resort to rob
Spend your whole life
Living it for the white
You got a 9-to-5 and now you choose to live it right](2506084)
You taking your ass to the Army 'cause you scared of revolution
I'm writing every day to stop that brain pollution
I got a baby on the way, the cess is in my chest
I'm 18 years of age and black so I can picture less
I'm smokin' and drinkin' e'ryday, so playa, fuck a job
Educated and black, hangin' with the G-O-O-D-I-E Mob, nigga Yeah
Take you a li'l higher, knowwhatI'msayin'?
When you learnin', when you burnin' up that smoke
So you can choke on my quote
And get my ... down yo' throat
You just don't understand, youknowwhatI'msayin'?

Since it's on, type of nigga for the home invasion, surprise-prise
Motherfucka, pow-pow, lay the fuck down now
Naw naw, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you
(Why?) I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really 'posed to handle it

Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes

At a player's place, nigga takin my time

How you gon' feel when I skeet the 9?

Tough Guy,Music From and Inspired By Shaft ,2000.0,"Everbody on the streets
This a little thesis coming from me
When I throw up baguettes, sitting at the bar
Or smoking a little red life in my car
I don't know what you came to see
Nigga just out here feeding my kids
Throw up the duece and let me slide on by
Cause everybody wants to be a tough guy

Cruising down the street, minding my business cause I'm trill
Stopped at the ATM, grabbed a thousand dollar bill
Now I peel like apples and peaches because I'm chill
And niggas around my city respect me because I'm real
But still the things I see from day to day it irks me
When I'm off in the '79 Seville or the Bonneville
Niggas wanna hurt me, absurd G
I know it, betta believe I tote something for it
And I got a slogan like Nike but it goes like this, just know it
And I'm not the type of person be riding around your block just flashy
Just came to the store to get some black and milds and a lil bit of 93 gas,G
Wanna blast me, get sassy, say negative things about OutKast G
Riding all on a nigga dick, all you had to do was just dap me, come slap me
You the bad man, so go ahead and touch my cheek then
But we'll be burying you and your whole motherfucking family by the weekend
I'm calling your bluff, go on and buck, I got my squad we trapping
Aye C-bone gone slap this nigga, he ain't bucking, he just yapping, yea


Say, we took it from packing the pistols
To jacking this missiles, to stacking my crystals
Now my torpedo's even cracking your missile
When we start, ain't no stopping us
We too smart and too popular
Take your toys and we topple em
Resort to the dopplar
To the agent underground well known as Stankonia
Where trill as niggas go one and bad ass bitches be boning ya
I'm warning you, niggas i'll fill the middle of your moany
And make yo broad lick her pony up, its that platinum shit
Called zonia, tell Tommy blow me up
I ain't Mariah, bitch I'm the messiah can't no motherfucker show me up
UGK a set nigga, throw me up
Fuck catching a case bitch, i'll lace you and your homey up
Cause we the cream coming out of the crop
The steam coming out of the pot and the team coming out at the top
Your baddest or not, these niggas getting shattered or shot
Splattered for props, man you should'nt've left your gat at your spot


Pimp C bitch I'm a country star
I got a country mansion and a country car
I got a country bitch, I made a country son
I got some country nuts, I keep a country gun
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
So if you pay me a mil, you gotta give that nigga one
Fuck boys talk shit, but them bitch niggas know
And UGK run the streets and we put dick in your ho
Whether weed or blow, I keep an open store
I keep my hair cut low, .44 on the floor
You can test me Snow, we got the glass for sho
Get your mind on your money, cause you playing with your dough
Bitches who ready to go, say you moving to slow
If you wasn't bout sucking it, what you fucking with me for
The quarters in the side in case you didn't know
I'm Sweet Jones Bitch and I'm an old school pro, pro, pro


Since the beginning of time, up to the present of now
There are beauty shop playas also intelligent clowns
Got they blue cuts with brown, booty grinding the ground
It's the sound that's created when we get up to get down
Stimulate my imag-ination with exag-geration of stanking light
That can't be right but we laughed
To keep from crying, sighing, hugged by cutie-pie and
Death defying acts of a Blacks not scared of dying
Y'all act like you never take no bubble bath
Gone to Blockbuster and act like you ain't never cuddled after
You poked her, stroked, soaked her, provoked her
To reach for the sky when she's high on your holster
I'm posed to, roast you, toast you, close you
Motherfucking mouth for I'm almost closed to the end
So when they ask you what school do you attend
Say Stankonia High, then throw two in the wind",https://genius.com/Outkast-tough-guy-lyrics

What if everything you ever knew or known was lost?
The knees'll tend to freeze you when you gatherin yo' thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause ya mind ain't free
Constricted by the muthafuckin boundaries, an ounce of weed
Or a pound of 'dro couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting
Life from 
Bro, Bra, bruh, Brother, Bro-ham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
Wham nigga, wham! Don't they say that in their show, dad?
Fo' sho' man, you acting like a tadpole out of gonads
You know OutKast the truth, hit the booth, be makin' more jams
Spreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program
(Fuck the learning curve) We took our ramp to No Man's Land
Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?
Serve me up, I want some

Buggface, toe jam
(Frown ya face up, cause we don't give a jam)
Jam to the jam, go jelly to the jam
(Imagine me not jamming, shove it up ya monkey jam)

When I'm left alone, I get to thinkin to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like everything is alright, clearly tight to def
I can see clearly now, analyzing every step (step)
Clearly you can feel me cause it's beating through yo' chest (chest)
And you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip but wet
With no tint, not deject.. clearly I'm a vet
And not no veterinarian but clearly pit bulls are the best (are the best, are the best)
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you actin like ya don't, then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
Cause the ticket is a one-way, (clearly) back we won't be coming

We dungeon rats Outkast and Goodie Mobbin
Enough of the petite talk, I'd rather have a nigga with a perm
Ain't got to have punk, on my side than a nigga who frontin
To another nigga's interpretation of god-stuntin
My growth, why vote for president if he a spot guy
That's like choosing which bullet you gon' get shot by
A drank and some hot fries
Slowly eating me up from inside to outside
Well you gon' die anyway, right? Wrong
I plan to live forever, I know it seems mighty long
If you think about it in Earth terms
Thank god we on the TV what we let like earthworms
Stay underground like Cheers or Dig Dug
Only come above to shake hands and give hugs
Lay your beautiful body down on this fur rug
You got to give a damn if you do not give a fuck, ha!
Rack 'em up 'cuz we bustin'

Throwin' snake eyes thinkin' a nigga gon' fold
Stand down like four black vogues on golds
Snatchin' all the dough and leavin' y'all broke
Going all out for an A plus in class
I bust ass walkin' barefoot over broken glass
Now who gon' pass player? You won't last
See we all in the race just taking up space
If we's on the other side of the track grab the straps
Thought y'all knew wild dogs run in packs

On some old school shit, like we high schoolin'

There he is!

Go masturbate you jack-off, nigga take the hat off

But now them niggas done passed me, I'm just a baby daddy

And smoke the soft softball saw through the way-hall

But that's because my face is in like eight different yearbooks
Could've been took the S.A.T. but the streets got the best of me
Thinkin' and drinkin' and bankin' open while like sesame
All tellin' me to chill out (chill out!)
Before you be a drop out (chill out!)
Or cop out, is when you're thirty-something at your mom's house, yeah
Don't stop and uh don't quit cuz uh
We own that high school shit and uh
You know that uh we spit it
Jitterbug jam now can you dig it?

Clue (Clue)
Clue (Clue)...

New Outkast
For my dirty South Niggas

Out of the basement
Out of the dungeon
Look at Georgia boys
What have you done to them?
Rippin and sippin
Pimpin' and clippin'
And trimmin' up all the women
I'm swimming
But it's odd to me your words are kind of drippin'
I'm trippin'
Your flow's non-existant bitches missin'
Like Eric Robert Rudolf
Or Puss in boots with his boots off
Howdy doo boss
Check the southern slang boy I got a true drawl
From East Pointe to New York
It's OutKast and clue y'all
Howdy doo, y'all (Howdy doo, y'all)
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the doo-wops and the fellas
Fuck the Haters and the Heathers
Like my flows and ho's alike
Cuz everything is 9 or better
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the doo-wops and the fellas
Fuck the Haters and the Heathers
Like my flows and ho's alike
Cuz everything is 9 or better
Pissin' in the wind
Or shootin in the dark
Out on a blind date
Maybe fucking in the park
Without a rubber on
We are not alone
When I was younger songs
Had more fucking meaning (Meaning)
Now we are fiendin' for the new-new doo-doo
Stankonians activate that part of you that don't mo-ove
You think you're gettin' closer but you don't have a clue
Who only plays nines's and tens on the 1 and 2's
Hook (x4)
We can do it too
Funkanella, funkanella

Allow me to remove your crew of those Iceburg sweaters
Boy I've never seen soft punch a fella
I remain in, the company of insane men
I be the reason niggas in the jeep's will tuck they chains in
Keep it swingin'
Why you trippin'
Hey we brothers
I'm like why you sniffin'
I got a snort habit motherfuckers!!
Niggas up the ante
But all your high yella heffa, got you up her panties
Leave bitch niggas naked like D'angelo
Crying and close to dying on they grandma's flo'
If you tell us where the dope at then I promise we go
Stop crying, stop praying where the yeh at ho'
Don't you dare scream Jesus I can snuff your mouth
Money, dope, you let these D boys move out your house
From Red Oak to Red Hook, I'm theme music for crooks
Michael from Adamsville with a murderous look
Leave you shook and nigga Punchenella, punchenella
I urge to Rob, rob-a-Fella, rob-a-fella
*Break {Speaking}*
Ayo rob that fellow man
And give me his god damn jewelry nigga
Hell yeah nigga
Strip down, strip buck naked for a nigga
Get that for it nigga
Strip nigga

Who can rip like this

Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquamini and Roc-A-fella
I got the doo-wops and the fellas
Fuck the Haters and the Heathers
Like my flows and ho's alike
Cuz everything is 9 or better

Now Slimm ain't havin' it
A DF advocate
Bustin' with Kast and Clue
Now Calhoun with a 'matic means
Shit can get tragic, mu'fucka
So what you gon' do
It's the deal pushing flash pan
The big deal change
I'm working up
Two in the back
Tocked out in the main
Keep this thing blowin' for the heathers and the hatas
Just got off the caper for the case in Decatur
Now I stacked up and sacked up in the back to the block
With eight bars to the heart
To asert it I chop
Keep working with 24 in the Glock
Major deep game, aquamini and Roc
Who can rip like this
Punchaneller, Punchaneller
Oh Outkast and DJ Clue
Aquemini and Roc-A-fella
