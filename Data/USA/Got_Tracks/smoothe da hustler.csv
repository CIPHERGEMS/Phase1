Broken Language,Once Upon a Time in America,1996,"Uh, base your eyes on the guy
That has no kind of worries if I die, so, pussyclot, try
Dangerfield stepping my way
Bodies get cremated on a Friday the do-or-die way
Your death threater sender, head spinner
Rap beginner, light dimmer, three-knockout-count winner
The gun reacher, busting-shot teacher
Your funeral-serving church preacher
Your black hearse coffin seeker
The body polluter, the gat shooter
The Brownsville, wild Brooklyn trooper
The cock-D mountain mover
The face basher, the Mr. Brain Smasher
The ass waxer, the drug money stasher

The money stasher, gun-blasting razor slasher
The human asthma breathtaker, body-dump waster
The Glock cocker, the block locker, the rock chopper
The shot popper, the jock cockblocker
The face splitter, human-disgrace getter
The lady shitter, phone joneser
Sneak over fuck your babysitter
The chronic-smoking, gun-toting hearse initiator
Crack supplier, the human drug generator
The honey gamer, the chicken tricker
The slicker, long-dick pussy-sticker
The ready-to-bust-that-ass kicker
The track maneauverer, the box burrier
The off-the-dome rapper, the C-74 ox carrier

The gun seller, the chest sweller
The stick-up, smack-bank-teller
The money bag dweller
The stitch provider, the Guess rider
The clip inserter, the bullet shooter experter
The man next to murder

The ho-bitch disser, the cunt man, the “I-don’t-want-clan”
The stunt-hitter-in-34-days-in-a-month man
The front man, the Brooklyn representer
The beat-down sinner
The two brothers, the hottest niggas out this fucking winter

The girl cheaters, the beef ass-beaters
The street-sweep keeper, the body-to-concrete meeter
The blood skeeter
The weed smoker, the liver choker
The spot stockbroker, the rugged-picture poser
The card scrambler
Royal flush, same suit, poker gambler
Nasty amateur damage ya
Snap master without the camera

Camera, the beer guzzler
The slug to your mug tussler
The drug juggler, the crazy thug hustler
The Lexus wanter
The chain, ring, and bracelet flaunterer
The chamber smoker
The mansion-having sauna soaker
The corner stander, the style crammer
The takeover-spot, block commander
The Glock-on cock-handler
The razor-spitter, human disgrace getter, the fast-dough cashflow getter
The transmitter, North Carolina vagina hitter

The ass kicker, the internal-heart dart sticker
The red scope body hitter
Hang with Digga and The Booty Lickers
The trigger happy, father gun call it “Papi”
My gun blow out crazed wig patterns to keep your hair nappy
To-the-death thinker, M.O.P. bell ringer
How about some hardcore fan singer?
The jam swinger

The Nautica wearer, the Karl Kani man
The Mr. Get Jig, the fly man
Notorious Ready-to-Die man
The Noah killer, the expert slayer
The white girl gangbanger
The Virgin Mary fucker, the Jesus hanger
The vital kicker, the drug dealer and title stripper
The idol flipper
The cross breaker and Bible ripper

The Black History thriver
The racial thinker
Denying-a-9-to-5-hour, the jaw sinker
The hell fighter, the revelation writer
The Egyptian spirit inviter
The black-body-bag tier
The money stasher, the nigga trapper
The AKA club basher
""My brother got a record"" bragger

The barrel spinner, the grand prize winner
The life-and-death beginner
The 95-Interstate-highway-to-heaven sinner
The cocaine cooker, the hookup-on-your-hooker hooker
The 35-cents-short-on-my-two-for-fives overlooker
The rap burner, the Ike to Tina Turner
Ass-whipping learner, the hitman, the money earner
The -tologists without the derma, me and my little brother
The cock-me-back, bust-me-off nigga undercover
The Glock-to-your-head pursuer
The Big Daddy Kane, Little Daddy Shane overdoers",https://genius.com/Smoothe-da-hustler-broken-language-lyrics

Fuck whatcha heard,

I'm stoppin rent, ya title don't concern me
Ya learn in order to burn me
Ya gotta get open cause I close deals like A&R's and attorneys
Without the delay, no replay
In rap divisions I hold more records than my DJ
No relays, I'm runnin marathons for bein sick
Projectin noise through the clique
Now he sell tapes at a sell-a-thon
Bring me the illest nigga, the realest nigga, to feel this nigga
I'll send him home to his Bruce Willis
Niggas sayin, ""We got to kill this nigga.""
Chorus: Trigger
Fuck whatcha heard, here's a Brownsville wild killer
Projects strangler, blood spiller
(Repeat 4X)

I always knew I had Big Willie potential
Drop the raps on tracks, drop the tracks on wax, an dat's official
I crashed you, who gassed you
Niggas talkin outta turn and out they ass too
Nigga, who asked you, I blast you
High screams'll turn to yodels
Can't You See my Notorious Big gun I pack'll leave ya Total-ed
The mass destructa, cash conducta, class constructa
You crossed the hustla's path at last muthafucka

The ransom note taped, with CB4 explosives

Smoothe Da Hustla reppin strictly keep my weapon wit me
Niggas steppin quickly die quicka when I'm high nigga
Hold up, whoever wanna rumble
Fuck da rumors and all that bullshit, when you

Caught the pot o' gold, and his four leaf clover, fucked his luck up
My Hill niggas from da avenue ain't havin you
Slip up, I'm quick to throw the clip up and start crabbin you
Chorus

I bring the drama straight from Saratoga Ave
Get more letters than dat Abby bitch
Straight outta Brooklyn like Matty Rich
 (Brownsville!)
It's suicidal, takin my title
Cuz my freestyle recital is vital
Silly and more slicka den Billy Idol
I'm breakin herbs down better than stick shifts wit clutches
Stiff dick touches clits like Brownsville lips to dutches
I'm nuttin ta fuck wit, ya couldn't oppose this
Hill niggas be takin ab's while I be splittin seas like I'm Moses
I lyrically kill shit so grab the red tape
I turn live niggas to dead weight so get dat head straight
Gangsta niggas talk the wrong shit
Fuck rappin and livin, fuck who you down wit
Who you know, or did a song wit
I'm out for self, the streets got me hip
So I pack steel, my rap open ears to keep me GQ to the tip
I flip and break fool, that's word to mutha
Playin niggas soft, they break North
Cause I come off like a used rubber
Chorus:

One mo' time for your mind; Trigga nigga;

Only Human,Once Upon a Time in America,1996.0,"Nobody understand

I'm only human
I'm only human (My everyday lifestyle)
I'm only human (As a struggle)
I'm only human
I'm only human (As a life thing)
I'm only human
I'm only human (See, everything is misunderstood)
I'm only human.(less ?)


Peep the steelo if you don't know me
Slowly, you'll begin a holy accountable for criminal acts when i hustle
Brothers be on a cops snitching stuff get the tussle
I'm strictly on a Glock spittin' stuff
And for new jacks
Talkin' about bustin' cats in their new raps
What's perhaps convinced by smooth?
True that, true that
I dismiss fools like Mr. Menace
I make the Illmatic with baking soda
Been ringin' bell never seen with ?
The struggle
The keep the family from warning
The fast money
The keep man, my people's floatin'
Sign the deal, get it to jail clothes
Me no selling none of ya ? hotel melt rows
The rap is my place, i sell o's
My everyday routine counting green
Rock will be the sin, ruckus be the team
From public school got the feedback
I stay cool like G Rap
?scorning? fools, no tunes snatch ya b-pack



My little hustle turned into big ones
Little money turned into big funs
Boxcutters turned into big guns
My avenue stay clouded with playas and hustlas from '82
To 88 plus my lady crew
Drop me kid
Used to dress sloppy kid
Car from poppy in east new york now they clock me kid
Versace kid
Copy the gear when they watch me kid
Hook with the yard now i'm ? the winner like Rocky kid
Push stressed side cause money may be violent
Mom sayin' i'm blessed with a talent
And i should thank God but i don't want my mother thinkin' i'm a punk
So when she go to sleep i get up my bed and pray silent
My mother way is good so i copy her
Me and my clique is so tight we kiss chicks just like the Mafia
I'm over top of ya
And in the industry
When they mention me
I mention ruckus cause i'm real



Once in a while i do the Mac-up
For those to act up
I back-up
Cause '96 i'm running rap maps
And for jealous fellas there's no help form
The only reason i made medicicine square
For steppin' trough my garden cause i felt form
The reason how i give it
Even if my everyday lifestyle ain't nothing but a hustle why i'mma live it?
I drop jewels and stop crews from steppin' up
You got beef, then throw your weapon up
I ease and squeeze at ya mellin
No time for yellin' for sellin'
I became a second time fellin'
The street like ? and custom to make me see my mistakes
No more bells, no more jails
And takes a lot to admit your wrong doing
Representin' thus what i'm on doing
Speaking the truth's what my song's doing
The ill reason, the real reason
The ready aim cocked is still reason",https://genius.com/Smoothe-da-hustler-only-human-lyrics
Food For Thoughts,Once Upon a Time in America,1996,"The question is why the answer what makes
If u wants my opinion I tell you don't take x 2
Why...
(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Why is it hard for my words to get heard
The uncut give it to niggas raw gets absorb
Why is it that every black brother talks the slang
Why is it that slang determines if a brother hangs
Why is it that people judge niggas by how they look
Why is it that hoodies on my head makes me a crook
Why is it that people got to struggle to survive
Why is it that nine to five is harder to get in ninety-five
I wonder why that those that heard of me started making records all of a
Sudden want to murder me
Why is it that niggas talk the talk but never walk the walk so I talk the
Talk if niggas scared to walk New York
Why is it that those who chose to live the street life greet life with a
Slug to his mug and scared to greet life
I wonder why it is harder for my family why it is the man in me that keeps
Me thinking that no bodys understanding me
Chorus x 4
(Smoothe Da Hustler)
What makes a man a strong man
What makes a woman a strong woman
Don't confuse wrongg one
Cause intellectual keeps it exceptional for both
It is just my professional side that keeps me wondering without a loaf
What makes it possible for me to kick to you
Predict to you for future reference
For you to take heed but that's your preference
What makes two hundred and fifty seven degrees from one hundred eighty seven
Five o's tapes Lp's and Cd's
What makes one hundred percent one hundred and ten percent to be quit foul
I am built like five percent is on my lifestlye
What makes my click my click
What makes my chick my chick
What makes my vic my vic
What makes my dick taste an slick
I wonder..
What makes a hustler crew is it what I slang to u
Or what I bring to you
Behind closed doors
Or what I bring to you from of the mind record
What makes me slow is this
What makes me grow is this
What makes me know and blow is this
Chorus x 4
(Smoothe Da Hustler)
Now that everything is of the chest
There is a couple of matters I must attend to before I rest
Don't take my family
Don't take my people
Don't take next level cause to me there's no equal
Don't take my click
Don't take the hoodies or the hats
Don't take the burners and th gats
Don't take the BMW's and the MPV's
Don't take the keys
Don't take the g's
Don't take the gooses
Don't take the grim's
Don't take the kaki jeans or the tims
Don't take the studio
Don't take the tracks
Don't take the spots
Don't take the cracks
Don't take the weed that I smoke
Don't take the name smoothe wrong or this jam for a joke
Don't take the players and the hustlers getting cash
Don't take the projects
Don't take the ave
Don't take the females that I talk to
Don't take the Glock that I cock on the blocks that I walk through
Don't take my daughter
Don't take my son
Don't take my pride
Ever died by the gun hold this
