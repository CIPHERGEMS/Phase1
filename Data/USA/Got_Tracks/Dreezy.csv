Up & Down,Schizo ,2014.0,"Why you givin' up on us, like you don't know all the shit we been through?
Everything use to be right, now you be actin brand new
Thought I was your friend too
If we in it, it's gonna' take two
I be yellin' until I go blue, but I never would give up on you
And fuck everybody that's hatin', degrading they always got something to say
The wanna' see us apart, that's why they smile in your face
Tatted your name on my heart, that way it never would fade
Even when loving get hard, you somebody I never would trade
You're somebody I'll never forget, cause' with you all my feelings legit
These oth-er couples ain't on shit, No one else in my heart is gon' fit
I want you to be there when I'm rich
And I know that I act like a Bitch
But, you should just make me yo' miss
If we fall, we just taking a risk

Don't tell me that you love me if you don't (you don't)
I just wanna' be by your side
So, maybe we should drop our pride
Let's keep it one hunnid'
We breakin' up and keep makin' up, it won't stop (Won't stop)
But, I'll never leave, cause' I know that you are my rock
I ain't giving up, cause that ain't how I rock (how I rock)
We go up and down, we go up and down (up And down)

Why you be getting mad at me, like being committed is easy to do?
Niggas be all on my heels, but they ain't got nothing on you
These bitches be lovin' the crew, but I never be frontin' on you
Kept it real, and the feelings is true
Im attached like im laying in glue
You say that you love me, so if that is true, we gon' have to make it official
You be blowin' me like I'm a whistle
But, I better come first like initials
Cause' I been your girl from the start
Even would bitches would tear us apart
Took me a chance and I put down my guards, now you the only nigga' with my heart
And I could put that on my soul
I can see me with you, when I'm old
If I wanna escape, would you roll?
If I was falling apart, would you hold?
I'm done overthinking, will it really last I a never know
But, he see through me like a microscope, and  here for em
Just to let him know, that I feel em'

Don't tell me that you love me if you don't (you don't)
I just wanna' be by your side
So, maybe we should drop our pride
Let's keep it one hunnid'
We breakin' up and keep makin' up, it won't stop (Won't stop)
But, I'll never leave, cause' I know that you are my rock
I ain't giving up, cause that ain't how I rock (how I rock)

Spar,Hip Hop Hit List (Vol. 3),2017.0,"Aye mayne, I like the depth of this song, ya know what I'm sayin'
Not the death of the song but the D-E-P-T-H of the song
Ya feel me, the complexity and shit
I like the topic
Kodak Black man

Look my word is bond as fuck
My life is hard enough
They not rewarding us
They disregarding us
And if I go to D.C., I'm tryna spar with Trump
I'm not a politician, just can't ignore the stuff

This really just a free verse, I put my life in reverse
I dug up out my old pain and put it on a t-shirt
So many sides to this shit, not here for popular shit
Your own people will laugh when you on positive shit
Before I die, I'ma teach, I light a blunt and I preach
Ain't no facade you could see, that I can only be me
I got a daughter to raise, one day she gon' be a queen
I'm tryna get shit together, so she can have anything

My word is bond as fuck
My life is hard enough
They ain't rewarding us
They disregarding us
And if I go to D.C., I'm tryna spar with Trump
I ain't a politician, just can't ignore the stuff

I take this life how it come
Got heart but still won't show love
If I tell people where I'm from, they might think I gotta gun
Got J's that's still in the box
No tax or bands on my ones
I took my feelings out this shit and put my trust in my funds
Tat my dead homie on my sleeve
Don't need glasses, to see what I see
Told me at ten, what I wasn't gon' be
Nigga ain't make the league, so we turn to the streets
Cops wanna blast 'fore they see ya I.D
Might do the race 'fore a nigga catch me
Damn if it be another R.I.P
It's a black/white world but I only see green
Killers gettin' off innocent, when the clip showin' that he did the shit
Try and talk and they ain't listenin' but they'll point it out when you get ignorant
Fuck with you if you a benefit
That's why I pay off cash at the dealership
But I got money stashed for the bills and shit
But I'ma write it off, good penmanship
Can't say we represented when half the office White Supremacist
This can't be, ""Land of the free""
If kneeling might cost your position
I'm supposed to respect the system
Then call our brothers, ""Sons of bitches""
And when my Unc' came home from prison
For the same shit y'all tried to turn into a business
Man, take our culture, our blueprint
Pay the knockoff to come model us
Hurricanes come and swallow us
Opp niggas tryna put the dot on us
We pourin' Henny, cause we all bottled up
Granny still scratching Lottos up
But the bible say its goin' full circle
I'ma tryna find me a good purpose

My word is bond as fuck
My life is hard enough
They not rewarding us
They disregarding us
And if I go to D.C., I'm tryna spar with Trump
I'm not a politician, you can't ignore the stuff

Ain't old enough to hit the club and fill my cup with rum
But I can go die in the army, goin' to war for them
Ain't old enough for marijuana cigars, or spark my blunt
But old enough to spend my life behind bars, that's dumb
Totin' magazines that got me in the articles
When I'm in Washington D.C., I'm doing fraud n' stuff
Ain't worryin 'bout Donald Trump
Ain't worryin 'bout seeing no monuments
These people got weather control
Where the hell you think Hurricane Harvey from?
The wind ain't got no name
Where the hell you think Hurricane Harvey from?
These people control the rain, these people be diggin' bunkers up
But they only got two more years of slavery to do harm to us
I feel like Kunta Kinte nigga, I'm the one who fought for us
I was in the clubs in 6th grade, fightin' the adults and stuff
Feel like Kunta Kinte nigga, I'm the one who fought for us
Ever since the 6th grade nigga, I was the one who fought for us

Ever since the 10th grade nigga, I was the one who fought for us
So I feel like Kunta Kinte nigga, I'm the one who fought for us, yeah
I fought for us, nigga I die for us, nigga I risk my life for us
I risk my life for us nigga and I'll die for us nigga",https://genius.com/Dreezy-spar-lyrics
Close to You,No Hard Feelings ,2016.0,"I just wanna take away the pressure
I knew you were special when I met you
Hate the way you bottle your confessions
I wait for you, I gotta know, I gotta know
Who you, who you, are
And you ain't gotta worry when you with me
I vibe with your mental because you get me
And whenever you want me, you can hit me
I'll be there in a minute boy

We might just end up sharing skin babies
Siamese twins baby
I wanna get close to you, oh, woah-oah, oh-oh-oh
Ah, alright, oh
Baby I think we done talked enough
Hit some of this kush and take this cup

Said I was through with niggas, but I really want him
His swagger got me falling like a leaf in autumn
And I don't give a damn about his baby momma
He always on my mind, I think I'm 'bout to call him
It might not last forever but it speed the healing
This ain't the same with him, I get a better feeling
Don't care 'bout what they say, it ain't nobody's business
I said I wouldn't fall, I guess you got me slippin'

Anything you want, I got it
In my feelings, boy, I'm so about you
I just wanna get to know your body
Baby anything goes

Wasted,No Hard Feelings ,2016.0,"You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted

Now tell me would you? (waste it)
Would you, would you...
My time, my time
Would you...my time, my time
Would you waste (waste it)
My time, my time
My time, my time
(Waste it)

What's up, where you at? You know I need that
You fuck me drunk, the next day ask for feedback
You say you love me, boy I don't believe that
You say I fuck with you man, don't repeat that
I know what you do, I know what you do
Tell me when you're drunk, tell me when you're through
(Wasted)
And you always on that late shit
You only wanna call me when you're wasted
I like you sober, I like your sober
When you wasted you reckless, nobody told you
No, nobody told you
When you on that bottle, boy I can not hold you
You on that bottle you say you don't need me
You on that bottle you say shit so easy
I understand it, I see how you plan it
First you get drunk then you go to demanding
That over the top shit, this how you feel
This how you feel, this-this how you feel
Next day it's waters and Advil
This how you heal, this how you heal

You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted

You take it straight and you swallow, uh huh
Drink it down 'til it's empty, that's when you say that you holla
(Tell me would you?)
You ain't pour up a chaser, now you chasing the models
Shit I think that nigga like me cause I'm shaped like a bottle
(Tell me would you?)
See, yeah, he hit me up when he want sex
Like ""Bae I need you, I won't flex"" (I need that)
2 A.M that blowing up with them missed calls and them drunk texts
Pull up on that fat wet-wet, put him out, yeah, that bed rest
And he'll wake up that next day looking at me like, what sex?
The Jamison, the Remy, then the Hennesy
Lately I can't tell if you in it or you into me (I don't even know man)
I really wanna give him one more shot
But all he really wanna do is take one more shot, damn

You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted
(Tell me would you?)

Drowning in your liquor
Found you in your feelings
Telling me to come and get you
Say, don't bring nobody with you
I feel so emotional
Oh, waste of time loving you
Waste of time loving you

You only want my time when you're wasted
You only hit my line when you're wasted
You tell me you love me when you're wasted
I'm only on your mind when you're wasted

Used to post up at the trap and now we got a P to match
Pull up with my hypeman, but he don't rap, he just strapped
And they stomp you like a fret if any nigga try to cap
Ice and grips and takin' trips, might cop a zip and make it flip
R.I.P. to Double G, she kept a P and that was it
Treat my bitches like my holster cause they're always on my hip

Up a roll and it don't fold, I got new hundreds, no dubs
Got this shit up out the mud but I remember we used to juug
With some thugs and they shoot like Elmer Fudd
Yeah, pull up on you just for sayin' somethin'
Swear I'll throw a tantrum
If you been gettin' it with your best friend, this your anthem
Still the same bitch, won't see me out here with no random
Now we on the road and I'm stickin' to the code
Way before we touched the bag we still was makin' bitches mad
Not in class, but they still congratulate me like a grad
Out here beefin' with your day one over these niggas and it's sad

The last nigga said he ride for me
The last nigga was the last nigga that I ever trusted cause guess what he lied to me
And last time was the last time thats what I said last time
Until I call that nigga phone at 2 a.m.and told him I wanna do it for the last time
And of course he was with it
So yea you know I payed a visit
And on my neck I felt his kisses
Fuck it it ain't nobody else business

I dont know that to feel its
Taking over my mind taking over my body
Dont know how to heal it
Cause I keep on coming back
Its like I gotta bad habit
Yea Yea...
Its like I gotta bad habit
Is it really that easy for you to leave me
Have me fall for you then deceive me
Lied to me like you need space
Whole time you was in another bitch face
Who was there, who was there for you
You couldn't breath I was air for you
When I needed you baby where was you, I created a monster now im scared of you
I love you but I hate you
I just wanted the perfect picture to paint you
But you ain't see it how I see it
You knew what you was looking for but didn't know how to be it
I feel like a fucking idiot oblivious that you was so insidious
This love thing can get real hideous
But really is you just wasn't serious
I knew what I wanted from the start and you was curious
Somebody tell me what it feel like
He told me he will keep it 100
I heard love is blind though
I guess thats why I ain't see this coming
You the man you got action
Say I be tweakin I be spazzin
Is it love or satisfaction
Was it real from the start

I dont know that to feel its
Taking over my mind taking over my body
Dont know how to heal it
Cause I keep on coming back
Its like I gotta bad habit
Yea Yea...
Its like I gotta bad habit",https://genius.com/Dreezy-bad-habit-lyrics
Bad Bitch,No Hard Feelings ,2016.0,"Bad bitch
I'm slaying all these hoes, I'm a savage
Ain't with no basic shit, I'm not your average
Feelin' like I'm Kobe, I ain't giving niggas passes
Yeah I get it but I go hustle like I ain't had shit
If I got paid to piss you bitches off I'd be mad rich
Flexing on the gram but broke in person, that's a catfish
Got her own money and a crib, now that's a bad bitch

Gave mercy to these hoes, what would Jesus do?
Somebody got to take a loss, shit it was me or you
Mean mugging in the Ghost, they yellin' Beetlejuice
My niggas with me got more stripes than an Adidas suit
I took a break from all the hype to let you bitches get practice
They want me to give my seat up like I'm Angela Bassett
Probably catch me in the closet like I'm coming out
Hope bitches just as good on foot the way they run they mouth
Your man outside and what he drive was the only challenge
First date, hundred a plate, that's how I know he got it
Get you touched the first defense so niggas know we 'bout it
Trippin', have you swimmin' out on Stoney Island, this ain't no emoji battle
Numbers start doubling when they mention my name
I seen the cockiest, gift of god and as quick as they came
Somebody call the traffic guard, these niggas out of they lane
I bet these bitches gon' respect me like a pimp with a cane

Bad bitch
I'm slaying all these hoes, I'm a savage

If I got paid to piss you bitches off I'd be mad rich
Flexing on the gram but broke in person, that's a catfish
Got her own money and a crib, now that's a bad bitch

I'ma let you niggas run with the hype
Your favorite bitch on Instagram don't look like that in real life
Your favorite nigga in my DM's but ain't even my type
And your favorite rapper should be acting cause she don't even write
Talk of the town, I walk around like I woke up with a crown
These bitches tryna take the sauce but they can't fuck with the sound
You always with a yes man, I keep real niggas around
Put in that work 'til we proud, we got this shit off the ground
And I'm still fine with no makeup so I'm slayin' hoes when I leave man
Second time getting top from the same nigga, call this shit a recap
Got the roof down with the seat back and a middle finger to the feedback
I heard rumors sayin' I went broke, only hating hoes will believe that
This shit mean more than a trophy
And shit you know you got that dope when bitches tryna get nosy
No matter what day of the week I'ma get high like I'm Smokey
I keep it charged like a mophie, don't let these bitches provoke me

Bad bitch
I'm slaying all these hoes, I'm a savage
Ain't with no basic shit, I'm not your average

I found out you was shady, though (Shady)
I thought I was your baby, though, yeah (Your baby)
God showed me signs a thousand times

Heartbreak might be the worst pain I ever felt
And I can't blame nobody but myself, yeah
I was tryna turn a jack to a king, had to play what I was dealt
I hate it even hit the point we gotta end shit
'Cause the outcome fucked up the friendship
I can tell that your interests is different
Thinkin' you can treat me like the bitches you been with
Y'all been in position, you live for attention
I'm on your team, why you get so defensive? (Don't get that)
You say I turn nothin' into big shit
Always get caught up in the slick shit
I took it personal
But I'ma carry on like a terminal
Could forget but some shit is irreversable
And tell that new ho you with I see her lurkin' on me (I see you, lil' ho)
'Cause I been that bitch
I'll straight end that shit (I'll take that shit)

Was your leadin' lady, you was followin' bitches
Crazy how IG hoes who not in the picture got me arguin' with you
Yeah, and you can put it all on the line for a nigga, he'll still switch
But every nigga wanna go hard, say how they on some real shit
Tellin' me to control my emotions
Never own up to the shit when you bogus
We smile for the cameras but losin' the focus
Your comments ain't matchin' the actions you showin'
Half this shit is just different
It feelin' like somethin' been missing
I gotta make my best decision
When it's said and done I'ma have to live with it
Not everybody deserve your affection
Write you a paragraph, delete the message
Everything I ever said, know I meant

Spazz,No Hard Feelings ,2016.0,"I'ma make money fast
Balmain's on my ass
Dump a nigga like ash
I'm the best he never had
I'm a real street bitch
I don't like checks bitch, I want cash
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz
Put a foreign on smash
Ride it 'til it's no gas
Flame a blunt and won't pass
See through niggas like glass
Skipping cities and the gang with me
We been doing numbers like math
On any nigga I spazz
On any bitch I spazz

Spend a feature on Balenciagas
Then I put the rest up in the stash
Through the city, probably doing fifty
But I got two-hundred on the dash
Ask a nigga, do he got milk?
Cause I left him with a cum-stache
Hit the BM went to Jupiter
Bitches only getting stupider
Keep a nigga with the Ruger tucked
All this switchin', don't know who to trust
They get money, this ain't new to us
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I'm coming and I gotta put money up
Thumbin', I run through them C-Notes
Broke nigga, we don't speak your lingo
Walking in my new Valentinos
I come through the back, with my niggas intact
And we dressed in all black like we emo
Flame up, we get high like a hero
Got money, we don't give a fuck if it's legal
I might call your number like bingo
If you cash me out like casinos
Won't get in my feelings and he know
Could never play me cause I'm single

I'ma make money fast

Wake up in the morning
Only thing I'm thinkin' 'bout is how to get richer
Took your nigga to the spot, he saw a bag of money, he thought I was a stripper
Ever since I could remember I been balling like I'm really at the dipper
Shawty used to talk shit now she want a pic to put up on her Twitter
Treat a nigga like a treat, call him when I need a fix
I'm in the gang getting tit, I was broke, now I'm lit
Hop in the whip and pull up on the curb
If he on foot he get hit with the curve
All of my niggas is strapped like the Purge
Pick up a check at the mall and I splurge

Might not let a nigga hit but if he getting pension, I let 'em lick it
If I gotta make the call, we gonna' set it off, nigga, Jada Pinkett
Cellphone steady ringing, if I ain't the money callin' I'ma miss it
Diamonds on me and they wicked, I can't stop, I need a ticket

I Love That Bitch,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh..
That's the perfect echo
Yeah.. Yeah..

Her sent is sweeter than swishes
With just a whiff of her fragrance
She have you stuck like a picture
By just the hell of her presents
She hypnotise by her assents whether
Depression or happiness
Is a curse or a blessing
SMOKE
I meditate for a lesson
CHOKE
And now I lost all my feelings
HOPES
She helps the pain heel faster
But if I get too attached to her
Ill start a deaster
Mary just want my money
She don't like me for me
Cos if the pain is like a knife
She ain't gon come stop the bleeding
And now I'm grinding and grieving
I don't know what I believe in
She just reminds me how I'm such
A fucking reck and the reasons
But I love that bitch
She help me zone out on the haters
And I love that shit..
And They say weed is like a drug
And I love the fix
I'm bringing heat
Like my lighter
I swear I love that bit..

When I'm with her
It feel like all is good
When I'm with her
I feel so understood
The relationship we have
Is very strong
Extendo so me and you can
Last very long
She fuck around and let the hood hit
But at least she getting money
That's my hood bitch
She real with me
I love her just
Like my bestfriend
I swear it feel
Like we are destend
And when we through
I roll again so its the best
And I hope smoking ain't like a sin
Cos its my blessing
I love weed, I love loud, I love mary jane
But shit when I be high I love everything

She know I wana hit
Ain't gotta ask it
But still I just treat her like a ho
Cos I just passed it
If she ain't with me on eid
Its like I'm fasting
So I guess I'm stuck with her
Until I'm in the casket
I told you I be smoking papers
Cos I see through you
And everytime I ain't around
I wanna be with you
She make me feel like
Ima lame gotta pay for this
I told her if ima pay for you
You gotta stay for this
Let's take a trip outa the town
And don't smoke
Ill sit and drown
Stick around
You baddest girl around no homo
Let's take a trip outa the town
And don't smoke
Ill sit and drown
You baddest girl around no homo

I know I said the last will be the last
But I keep on coming back
Keep the blunt and let it last

Dreamer 2,Schizo ,2014.0,"Lately I been up for days, barely even blinking
Rolling blunts and pouring cups to keep myself from thinking
In the mist of all this pressure, I be sinking
Niggas trynna fuck in the industry, they be winking
And I'm just a girl
19, with dreams of being on the big screen
Blue jeans, Jordan's, kind of cute but still can spit mean
Gas bill getting high, so fuck it, I'mma bring the heat
I'm trynna eat and it ain't sweet until I'm checking into suites
I doubled back and made it happen
Started writing poetry and now I'm noticed off of this rapping
Making music for niggas in Chicago that be trapping
But still can switch it up, for all the poets that be snapping
They told me that I'm blowing up, I'm trynna get bigger
Feel good to be played by radios, and not these niggas
A lot of people told I wouldn't make it, how you figure?
Then I realized, they want what I got, or they just bitter
Lame niggas
I never cared about my fate, because I know I got what it takes
So I'm in difference to the hate
I got to many hopes at stake
But, still I'm drowning
I feel myself surrounded
By doctors and machines, my blood rushing, head pounding
They say women don't make it, unless they on they knees
So I got down, on my knees, started praying, God please
Not religious, but I want it bad
So I be praying boy
Niggas tryna play me like a game, but I ain't playing boy
Mama barely cared for the crib
Was never this hard when I was laying in the crib
As a baby, who would think I would make it this far
But I be damned if I made it here, and don't go another yard
Shit is getting hard
I want it all, fuck a deal, if they ain't talking right
Been running my city for so long that I ain't walking right
I'm from CHICAGO
The city people die for
But, they ain't talking, they just shooting at they rivals
My grandma died in her sleep, next to a bible
I'm starting to feel like my life is just a recital
Niggas faking
So I be writing until my fingers aching
I'd stop breathing before I even think that I ain't gone make it
And everybody out here thinking everybody sleeping on em
I set alarms, and it's creeping on em
I had a fucked up life, I'm breaking down
So whenever I get me a swisher, I'm breaking down
And whenever I get me a bottle, I'm pouring up
Thoughts racing and I'm stuck
Soon enough, I'm slowing up
Then I get to throwing up
All the pain I was feeling
All the tears I was shedding when the obstacles was given
All the niggas on my side, that told me they would ride but they lied
Now I'm in the building and they outside
So, in the future when they see me in that beamer
Just know I wasn't shit, I turned myself into a dreamer

You think I'm just somebody thirsty for another dollar just so you can say I owe it to you

Soon as something going wrong
They be actin' like they never knew you
Nah, you don't really know me, do you
I paid off half you niggas debts
Yet I don't get my respect
I swear it's overdue

I promise I learned my lesson
This my story, I just hope you get the message
Since I was younger
My hunger told me my future was destined
I treated people like college
Didn't care if I got accepted
I had to pack up my luggage
Budget was tight but I stretched it
You ever believed in something
Even if you couldn't see it
They call it great, I call it faith
I knew with that I could be it
That's why I'm never afraid
That ain't how I was raised
Even if you switch up on me
Know that I'll never change

I showed 'em love
Now niggas feeling like they obligated
I made a choice
If it's stressing me I won't tolerate it
I got tired of waiting
I would think that you'd get tired of hating
This is more than a million viewers
Who think they love me but never met me
But more for those who could see me 
And won't forget me
Usually I'm alone
But at home I still got a family
Just praying I win a Grammy
Don't care if you understand me
That could be a blessing and a curse
You think I sound like her
She know I did it first
Don't tell me I'm too high
I'm charging what I'm worth
These niggas wanna eat
But they don't wanna work
I built this shit by myself
I don't need nobody help
Most niggas just wanna kick it
I might just give 'em a belt
You can't take this shit
Cause it's in me
Who said I fell off
Don't tempt me
It's fuck you if you ain't with me
Can't break my heart
Cause it's empty
You niggas thought you could get me

Nonstop,From Now On,2015,"I don't ever pass the blunt
This ain't no track meet
My bitch got shotgun
Put that nigga in the back seat
They tryna be like me
I think somebody hacked me
Who talking rap beef?
I killed them all by track three

They'll tell you dreaming ain't possible
And start pinching you but not pitching in
And I would tell you who the dopest is
But the feds probably out listening
Niggas money short as my attention span
I don't see nobody, got a different lens
Put the bait out and wait out
They bite the flow
I reel them in like fishermen
I'm a green lover when it come to money
But I burn trees like an arsonist
Get my medication from the pharmacist
You could leave that shake for the Parkinson's
Need a blunt rolled with my butt rubbed
From a young thug like Barter 6
Niggas act tough, get you fucked up
Now I'm back riding to Tha Carter VI
On Sunset swerving
Hella deep, got 'em nervous
Tease a nigga on purpose
I can be pitching how I be curving
Gotta head full of raps
Might as well walk around with a turban
Yo niggas like Lions on the Wiz
And ain't nan one got courage
All this gold on me
I'm thinking I just hit the jackpot
Stepping in Givenchy, feeling bitchy
With my hat cocked
'Bout to tell yo nigga, get a grip
He got the trap hot
Tried to put him on the team
He rather be a mascot
Don't look back, we ahead of ya
Middle fingers to the editors
I'm a predator, what competitors?
Wanna battle, gotta be better first
Got my toes done, I'm still a road runner
From the real estate, like a home hunter
If a bitch try to call me out
Then I'm knowing that she got the wrong number
Got picked up in a Rolls Royce
And the neighbors tried to call Ghostbusters
Ran in my ex 'bout a week ago
And I swear to God he was so busted
Yo last video looked good
But the song weak and it's no numbers
How we finna heat up on bitches?
I'm not here to fuck around and beat no summer
(Let's get it)
I don't get the hype that got you people all excited
I'm a walking knot, make a nigga wanna tie it
It's all about how you talk, might turn yo fan into a client
Told them ""Imma feed the streets""
I know the real ain't gon deny it
It's a party but it's private, you are not invited
They say ""since when you switched it up?""
I say ""I just decided""
I really live this life
Don't need nobody else to write it
Niggas swearing that they fly
I guess somebody shot the pilot
Fuck a Benz, I need that Lambo
Yeah, I got that ammo
I promise niggas won't get cleared like a sample
Made it to the hills
When my niggas still in a Bando
I'm so sick, I'm sipping Campbell's
Hate to watch and flip the channel
They say X will mark the spot
I signed the line and got that treasure
Finessed him out his plugs
I put business over pleasure
They tell me they opinions
I don't listen, fuck a lecture
I keep twenty on the dresser
Know these bitches feel the pressure",https://genius.com/Dreezy-nonstop-lyrics

I zoned out on my haters like a lecture
But every time I turn around I’m facing more pressure
Where I come from niggas don’t know morality
Fuck legality my mentality is vitality
Lack of normality killing both sexualities I just wanted to make it I’m hunted by actuality like
Insecurities are my reality I got a boy that’s on the side of me but will he ride for me

Trust who your enemies was once friends of ya I swear this life just ain’t me schizophrenia
I’m lost I need directions been running from the truth I’m out of breath I need a second
But I just smile as if it’s nothing wrong because until I find myself I’m just a perfect song
See when you feel neglected rejected it’s hard for you to ever just forget it forgive it
You live your life surrounded but you still feel alone I’m not at home even when I’m sitting at home I’m not myself any more

All this pain in my blood man I’m trying to deal with it
(Pain inside my blood)
I think I’m going schizophrenic
Who have I become I don’t know and now we’re missing

So maybe you should stay back

Worth It,No Hard Feelings ,2016.0,"Look what you did to me
You got me going out my mind
Never had real love before
I still just can't believe mine
It's everyone I met, was once my obsession
Ended up as a regret
Only right I confessed
Side of my mess
I just want somebody I can give my best
Don't turn your back like the rest

I'm not perfect
I have flaws
But I'm so worth it
And my heart broke once now I build walls
Not on purpose
I don't have it all
But I'm so worth it
I'm so worth it

Insecure, is it intuition?
Never knew someone like you existed
You might be the pieces that I'm missing
Hesitant but still l can't resist it
Know I ain't the richest, but I pay attention
You could be my partner, like we on a mission
Diamond worth a jigga
Down to pull the trigger
Bet I love you more than them other bitches
Used to run the liqour, judging in the mirror
Wish my hair was longer, wish that I was thicker
Gotta have a frame, so you love the figure
When I'm finished, hope you see the bigger picture
Imma be the realest with ya, I can be myself when I'm with ya
Got my guards but you beat the system
Made it to my heart, you got the key to steal it

I'm not perfect
I have flaws
But I'm so worth it
And my heart broke once now I build walls
Not on purpose
I don't have it all
But I'm so worth it
I'm so worth it",https://genius.com/Dreezy-worth-it-lyrics
Distant Lover,Call It What You Want,2015.0,"When I'm outta town and you not around, I be counting down till I'm back
Just understand that you the only man and you ain't gotta see where I'm at
Cause these niggas lame and I know the game if I lay with him, it won't be the same
When they know your name, all they want is fame. I gotta stick to who I first met
And you better answer your phone whenever I'm calling you
When I'm sleeping alone I be wishing that I was all on you
Why you thinking about if I'm creeping out?
I'm tryna figure out if you in the house now we both looking for a argument cause we can only go by our word or mouth
Why you always insecure? I thought I told you I was yours
The way you swung me off my feet, thought that you was doing chores
Niggas playing like a sport, tryna see if they can score
Thats why I only rock withchu, you show me a little more

I'll hold you down if you wait for me...
You know I hate when you away from me
I just need little bit... Can I get a little bit? (x2)

You're everything I want, You the only thing missing
Gotta focus on the real, I been busy reminiscing
If you was here right now, we'll probably be kissing
Use to call up Stevie Wonder, I knew he would wanna listen
You better answer your phone whenever I'm calling you...
Swear Ima be on my way and Ima want all of you
Cause I'm stuck at home I ain't doing wrong
I been holding on but its taking long
Playing love songs, go to bed alone, wake up and do it all over. All over..
I wish you could come over
You know when you come fuck with me, you can be anything except sober
Talking to you while I'm rubbing up all on your shoulders
Walk up on you, I ain't scared to get a lil closer

I'll hold you down if you wait for me...
You know I hate when you away from me
I just need little bit... Can I get a little bit? (x2)

Take it back for a minute, let me tell you how my heart got dented
I don't chase these hoes
But boy when I lost that nigga I damn near sprinted
Can't live without him, I gotta have him
And a bitch get slapped tryna grab him
But he fucked my feelings
Sad thing about it is he ain't even try to use a magnum
Months of time that I wasted
Thought it was sweet cause I taste it
How we end up here
All of your pics, your number
I just erased it
Yeah, wet tears on the pillow
Good, bad, and I'm stuck in the middle
Our love seem like it's a riddle
And now my heart need a fuckin' hospital
Dog no kennel
I was lovin', he was lyin'
I was deep and he wasn't even tryin'
Too many nights I was up late cryin'
And to think I blamed it on the timin'
Rewind it
When I was nobody to niggas that knew I was crushin'
Gave him my heart, but I knew we was rushin'
Thinking we lovin' but knew we just fuckin'

And it's like...
My head so fucked upp with these niggas
It's like...
I can't even feel shit no more
With all our trials, I was only in-denial
These niggas for everybody
Let me tell you how the rest go, yeah...

Yeah that nigga fucked mental
But I wouldn't take it back like a rental
He was selling the dream, I was buyin'
I was too attached and he was pryin'
I gave him space like a bar
He ain't shit to you, he my star
And I knew we probably wouldn't last
But I was scared to hurt like my past
Catching feelings for a nigga
Who probably ain't even like me
But he always come crawlin' back
Cause ain't nobody else like me
It's just nobody else like me
All these bitches don't like me
He probably want a ring from 2k
But ain't got a ring to come wife me
I tried to show him that I'm right
Fuck all my tears and our fights
Me without you just ain't right
You ain't me that shit, you just hyped
I ain't going no where, quit stallin'
I just want you to catch me, I'm fallin'

Then we pop Crys right after we hit the Swiss
Then later on that night you ain't gonna believe this shit

The door opens what about ten or eleven strippa's
The first thing I did was went into a room to pick up
A phone to call you but no said the liquor
But now I got the hiccups hands up like a stick up
Got to come all up in here and hear your ass bicker
And after all that what make this shit the worse
Even though I'm wrong I admit the truth hurts

You wanna sell out let me be the captain

You told me that you wanted to be a preacher
Now you mad cause I won't do a feature
It's crazy how the tables turn
But a lot of niggas wasn't real I had to learn that people never wanna see you get all the shine
But I look at them as if they can go up and go grind
Cause I gave up everything my biggest fear and my time
Just because I knew that I could turn my life to a rhyme
And look, you ain't got to lie to me and tell me that you love me boy
I know it's temporary like love in February that's why I drop my nigga in January just so you could spare me
Cause all the lies ain't necessary

I need nothing but The Realest
Can you be The Realest

All I need is nothing but The Realest
Can you be The Realest

I think I'm too real for bitches
When I'm honest people get in their feelings
But I would rather keep it real than to sit around and smile in your face that's the people that I hate the ones that disappear They see you up
Then they want to wish you luck
Come around when you get bucks but never really gave a fuck
With loyalty it ain't no second chance
Now I'm the first lady and the president
And ain't no feelings in this resident
I got fans more loyal than friends
Ain't got no man I'm in love with the bands
I had to plan & they ain't understand
I ain't got time for the BS
Or games like a DS or PS
Play niggas like recess

From Now On,From Now On,2015,"Yeah
Yeah

Ain't nothing promised
So I'm living
I get fucked up, that's my decision
That money power
It draw attention
Now when I talk, they wanna listen
My name get mentioned even when I ain't on Twitter
These bitches ain't got no class like they got suspended
That ain't your belt, go take that shit back to the lender
You really thought you could front on me, how you figure?
I got my money right now, I can feel the tension
It's time to cut these niggas off, hand me the scissors
You keep on dissing me, my name just getting bigger
Ready to battle, no it don't matter the gender

If I do anything I gotta get my shine on
Warn these niggas I ain't saving 'em from now on
All these blunts in rotation got my mind gone
You just pray your nigga ain't gon want my eyes on him
Heard somebody say I changed, that shit just blew me
I'm tired of bitches lying, acting like they knew me
Came up on 'em, now this money got me bougie
See these diamonds dancing on me, they like ""ooh wee""

Want my cake and I eat it too, I'm Betty Crocker
Got higher learning, kept that weed inside my locker
They can't believe we came this far like it's a shocker
I got my check up, I ain't need to see no doctor
I might be a lot of shit, but I ain't sorry
That money coming in on time, it's never tardy
Just got evicted but you still up in the party
Got a real binge and spent your rent inside a Barney's
Show respect when you see me, I'm far from average
All you was popping with my flow, I let you have it

Take me on trips and make deposits
But he can’t do shit for me
But give me head and buy my closet (run a check)
Yeah, I keep my phone on lock
If niggas wanna lock then that’s they own damn fault
He trippin', I hang up and say the call just dropped
Ain’t got time for none of that shit
But bought a cold wrist watch (ice, ice)
Fuck dat nigga, got a new one (true)
He got a Vette told me he a pussy connoisseur

Fuck that, gotta lick it
Get him down on one knee and make him trip like magicians

Swervin’ on him like Mike Vick (skrrt)
A nigga lucky if he hit me (you one lucky ass nigga)
Yeah, I just bought myself a chain
I got married to the money, so I bought myself a ring
I’m a brat, you know I'm spoiled
Wipe my back down with some oil
Treat my bitches like they royal, fuck that nigga, he ain’t loyal

Lonely,Schizo ,2014.0,"I just want to have somebody that’s for me only
It’s hard to find the one when all these niggas be on me
I thought that we was meant to be but I want you to show me
Cause let’s be honest nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be – be lonely, be lonely
Nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be – be lonely, be lonely
I showed you part of me that nobody’s ever seen
You ain’t appreciate it
But you sat in front of me and said you was in love with me
And I believed you babe, ay
But I tend to forget that these niggas ain’t shit
Kiss you right on your lips then hop in the whip with a dip like you wasn’t his bitch
Told you he was in love bitch he read you the script
One hunnit this as real as it gets
You think you the one you just one on the list
So I text all these niggas and give them the time that I offered you
Let them pull up on me, probably roll a stogie just to get my mind off of you
Cause I know you out with your back-up
If I catch her she gone need back up
So maybe I should just back up
Pulled my guards down I put them back up
I just want to have somebody that’s for me only
It’s hard to find the one when all these niggas be on me
I thought that we was meant to be but I want you to show me
Cause let’s be honest nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be – be lonely, be lonely
Nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be – be lonely, be lonely
It once was you and me
But you wouldn’t let it be
You’re so difficult
And really all you need is me
I wish that you could see
You’re so difficult, ay
I’m looking for somebody
But not just anybody
Cause if I give you my body
Then I won’t give it to anybody
But you tweakin, staying late on the weekends
You lying, you sneaking, she text you I’m peeking
You thought I was sleeping
You with her, you cheating, I’m cheated but creeping
I’m hurting, I’m heated, I’m through
So I called one of my niggas and told him come through
Ain’t got feelings for him but I told him that he was my boo
Let him lay me down but whole time I was thinking bout you
But what hurts the most is I know you be laying up too
I just want to have somebody that’s for me only
It’s hard to find the one when all these niggas be on me
I thought that we was meant to be but I want you to show me
Cause let’s be honest nobody wants to be lonely
Nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be – be lonely, be lonely
Nobody wants to be, nobody wants to be – be lonely, be lonely

Real,Call It What You Want,2015,"Oh no, can't fuck with the fake gotta fuck with the real
Best friend turned on me guess she really ain't real
Boy you know I gotta keep it real
So used to fucking with the fake can't tell what's real 

I hate how people be lying, claiming they real
A lot of niggas out here ain't got no chill
With me cause you know I got a meal ticket
If I was never doing this good
Still laying in the hood, no clout, would you still kick it?
I could see that there's a lot of real missing
So I gotta thank God that I'm still living
Everybody wanna call me lil sis
But I know I only got three real sisters
I had a homie I was down for
Turned on me, now she don't come around here no more
In time it will show more
You cool but I seen it before, I ain't so sure
That nigga lying if he saying that he know me
I got haters but I don't lose no sleep
Cause they ain't finna come sign my checks out
And I ain't met bitch yet that don't bleed
Had trust but its been a minute
They let me down I don't miss the feeling
Don't want your time but don't be offended
I'm just real so we not pretending
...

Made a lot of enemies cause I speak how I feel
I always been to myself and I'm that way still
Cause I know how it feel to be lied to
By the ones right beside you
I could never trust you even if I tried to
Everybody come around for a reason
I just ask niggas what's yours?
Never see me fighting over boys
I don't even want him baby he's yours
Don't come for me if never sent for
This the type of shit I've been for
Cause it's a lot of bitches hating on me
But like I said I gotta get more
I can feel the fake conversation
I just sit and make observations
Cause I remember when I was a child
Mama always told me never talk to strangers
A real nigga still looking for him
Come and tell me if you ever seen him

Invincible,No Hard Feelings ,2016.0,"You can't break what's in pieces
They tried their hardest to get rid of me
I'm still breathing for a reason
Prolly cause it's my season
And all my downfalls got overshadowed by my achievements
I knew that I was different but nobody ever saw the vision
So 'bout a year ago all of you believers was missing
Trying to offer me a slot like I paid for attention
All the clubs I couldn't get in
All the lists I wasn't mentioned
Imma show the critics who they underestimated
Take over city by city then might start real-estated
I'm black and educated, but I'm over dedicated
You can imitate it, but no bitch you cannot replicate it
That's why we separated. That's why you love to hate it
Even at practice I act as if it's the game day
I surround myself with niggas that think the same way
Now champagne for the pain, join the campaign

I was made for this
And if you want this show to go on then pay for this
They try to break me down but it down matter what they say
Cause' I already know
I already know
I already know
Just so you know, I'm so invincible

You could put me in a jungle but I come out with a mink
I've been living out my dreams I almost thought that I was sleep
I came from nothing, now nothing you want from me gon' be cheap
I might start charging to compete
I sent armies on the retreat
It took patience, I swear they broke me down til I feel like I couldn't take it
Now I bet all these bitches stay in line like they tracing
Get Benjamins for a payment
I never could be a racist
My words is killing you ladies, lets take 'em back to the basics
You fake relationships' for a paid placement
They wait to get on tracks with me like I'm a train station
Used to be like you cause I was in that same basement
Now when people talking the haters loop me in the same statement
I go overtime, fuckin' nine to five, takin' niggas off like a weekend
You praying I'mma hit rockbottom but I dove in on the deep end
Niggas say they smoking, but we never notice like a GPin
Now I'm here man never leaving

I was made for this
And if you want this show to go on then pay for this
They try to break me down but it down matter what they say
Cause' I already know
I already know
I already know
Just so you know, I'm so invincible

Whatever your throwing at me bet I throw it right back
Yeah, you say you know me, you don't know me like that
You could try to come at me, but I ain't going like that
Just so you know, I'm so invincible
I don't care what you heard about me
I don't care what you think I should be
Don't need security around me
Just so you know, I'm so invincible

I was made for this
And if you want this show to go on then pay for this
They try to break me down but it down matter what they say
Cause' I already know

I already know

And niggas askin' me stupid shit like who my competition
Ain't no fuckin' competition
Y'all in 2018, we in 2020, man, y'all ain't on shit
Shout out my nigga Southside
That bitch is gon' have to come with it, for real
I ain't even fuckin' around no more, look

Pull in Neiman Marcus right before I spark it
Let the valet park it then I hit Chanel (Foreigns)
LA regardless, all my haters garbage
And they shop at Target or they findin' sales (Bums)
I'm the new wave, fuck what you say
Got the cross on me like D'usse (Uh-huh)
I keep a nigga with the deuce-deuce
Every hundred on me got a blue face (Blue face)
Bring the AC with the AP (Burr)
The type of bitch a nigga can't keep
Got the top down, sittin' waist deep
I'm like, ""Can you see me?"" They like, ""HD"" (You see me, ho)
Bad bitches who I fuck with
The rest, I wouldn't put shit past 'em (At all)
Used to want to be a good girl
Now I'm finessin' niggas like a rich pastor
First check I got was like 50K
Went and cashed it out and just laid in it (Laid in it)
I don't care where you roll spliffs
We just dump the ashes, let the maid get it (Ayy, clean that shit up)
Made a name but ain't chase the fame
Bitches trade respect for a paid gimmick (Fake ass ho)
They sent for me so I came with it
Competition feelin' like a game scrimmage (I'm winnin')
I'm up before the cock-a-doodle-doo
At night I make it rain like chicken noodle soup
Got your nigga jumpin' through the hula hoops
He gave me top at 2, I told him toodle-loo (Bye-bye)
Niggas cappin'' like they really in the booth
But they just doin' somethin' 'cause it's cool to do
Heir to the two, shit old to me, it's probably new to you
I ain't goin' back to what I used to do (Never)
Bitches hatin' on me in an Uber Pool (Bum)
Fuck a nigga, man, I'm super cool
Brought my sis to LA on a Friday
Monday, she was like, ""I flew to school""
They know she my sister so she cool in school
Gettin' money like a Jewish dude
Niggas switchin' colors like a Rubix Cube
All these bitches switchin', I'm like, ""Who is who?"" (Who the fuck is these bitches?)
Mani pedi, meet me at the Bevy
When we throw money, shit look like confetti (Money)
Shooters hangin' with me out the Chevy
White girl rollin' doobies like she Lil' Debby (Ayy, roll that shit)
Lost a legend, RIP to G-Dot
Smokin' like a teapot, I can't wait to rerock (My bitch)
Got a ticket with me like a kiosk
Ballin' like a bi-yotch, flier than a peacock
And I'm ready for bitches to diss me (Yeah)
Got that new-new, I ain't talkin' Nipsey (Yeah)
Takin' shots, you was already tipsy (Pussy)
Still finessin' the game like a gypsy
Still rockin' Timberlands like I'm Missy (I be rockin' that shit)

The one that I could run, too
I got a confession
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
So you know how I'm coming
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

Empty bottles that was once Moscato, follow drinking models
Open up and swallow
Drinkin' out the nozzle, I forgot to model
I left with a waddle: if I reason, I won't know today tomorrow
I'm texting slur, looking for my words like I'm playing boggle
Nigga boosting up my confidence
I'm a Aires, so you know I'm dominant
I might drip on your lip like a condiment
Got a body out this world like a monument, honor it
Backspace, lol, don't tell I just called a cab to come get me
Eyes low and I'm way past tipsy
Said I'm not a freak, then I turn into Missy, miss me
You know I be pokin' from the side of me
He said he never seen this side of me
I said a good girl is what I tried to be
But I'm gone, put it all on you if you tryin' me
My body callin', so I'm dialing digits
I'm fiendin', I'm gone, text him something explicit
Ain't buy my drink, but I'm gone pay a visit
Be there in a minute, give him what he missin'
Let's get it

I got a confession
I ain't learn my lesson
I took a couple shots and
Now I'm drunk texting
I just wanna touch you
The one that I could run, too
I got a confession
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
So you know how I'm coming
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming
I'm coming

Thought I was lyin': now I'm on the way
When I pull up, what you gonna say?
I'm so in it, I just slipped up and called him bae
I was feeling myself with my lingerie
I ain't talking crazy, I know what I'm saying
I'm a little younger, but no, I ain't playing
I been thinking about it just as much as you
Been a minute, got me wanting something new
Favor for a favor, I got different flavor
Yes, I do deliver, but no, I don't cater
Got you feeling major, waking up the neighbors
I might beg for Marcy, but I don't want a savior
I left the club on a Tuesday
Got the shit to keep a nigga off of 2k
I hit the Ducé, yeah, got me to straight
Working on my body, you would think I'm tryin' lose weight
I'm just cappin', but I'm quick to leave him if he ever tweak
Word around his pipe game, crazy
And I might just need for you to fix a leak
Got him checking for me, like that nigga Meek
Now he catching flights to see me every week
With my legs around you boy, there ain't no runnin'
I just wanna show you how I'm coming

I got a confession
I ain't learn my lesson
I took a couple shots and
Now I'm drunk texting
I just wanna touch you
The one that I could run, too
I got a confession
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
So you know how I'm coming
I just wanna let you see how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming
I'm coming

Bitches dissin', I got sis' whole body lit, but I gotta go a little harder
I count it up for a minute
Soon as bitches thinkin' they got it, I'm gassing the pedal
I done fell in love with a nigga, in love with a bitch, which I wasn't on shit when I met 'em (Crazy)
Remember the day they took in my homie, I hit up her pops, ain't know what to tell him (Damn)
And we killers and felons
Say you got water, gon' aim at your melon

Lookin' at all these empty bottles, I got a problem
And I keep poppin' these pills, yeah, I'm the pill popper
And I keep gettin' into it with my bitch and fallin' out with my partners
Just got a text from my mama
She said her pipes done froze and bust, she need to borrow a few dollars (Uh)
I've been on the road so much I swear I ain't seen my son or daughter
I stay in and out of the MoneyGram
I spent a lot on the JPay
They done put my partners under the jail
I'm tryna to make sure that they straight
Pop the Perc' like I got two fates
Would swear you actin' niggas too fake
Let my partner stay with me for two days and he stole from me

Jumpman,UnKnown,2015.0,"Jumpman jumpman jumpman I don't need no stuntman
Coach said break a leg and I came back with crutches
If you pop off then my bitch jumpin now we double duthin
808 Metro EP comin they ain't see it comin nooo
Walkin on the moon I feel like Michael with his Afro
Order half the menu, he like Dreezy you a ass whole
Kickin bitches out the building like they broke the lease
He ain't know your name, you shoulda sang Alicia Keys
WNBA cause I been ballin like a bitch
Put a seven in a swisher, we ain’t rollin up no skimps
Walkin with a limp got me feeling like a pimp
Boy quit actin like a wimp, cause I can't date no fuckin
 simp
Barely be at home cause I'm always ona road
Know a couple MCM's that be stealin outta stores
He think I got hoes cause I'm always with my bros
Dabbin in my OVO's
Ask your bitch like 'what are those?'
Ain't no pay me back, you owe me money I need that now
I heard I fell off, I check the bank like tell me how
Can't be in no group that's gone end up like Destiny's child
Yo man keep on touchin me, I'm bouta call a foul
I bet I could make a nigga run back to me like he doin suicides
Pull up on them in my newest ride
And bitches fuckin for a Uber ride
Yeah I still rep the same city where you shoot or die
How the rap game got unified
You know Kanye, Common, Do or Die?
Nigga cross me, get crucified
Ima gone and let you decide
See the fake in you, need a new disguise
A bunch of bitch niggas with a (?), dress his ass up with a suit and tie
Now he job ready
Finger rockin but my palm steady
Fendi wallet, I be in his pocket, only call him when I need some arm candy
Grew up in the trenches, I know how to get it
Mama told me I was born ready
Celebration to them niggas hating
Tell the cleaning crew we need more fetti
Hit the club, it's like I own (?)
Keep on pushin like the door heavy
I don't care if it was ten dollars, holla when you see me, niggas know I'm petty
Lil bitches said I'm stealing swag lookin like a H&M mannequin
Ballin out in every state, referee pissed cause I keep traveling
Told em jumpman comin soon, all the trap niggas start panicking
Told coach Ima quit early if these weak bitches don't get more challenging

Don't make my niggas go wild with them automatics
Catchin feelings ain't my style, don't get to romantic
Can't relate to none of these broads we a different fabric
Keep them niggas like wow

This one for niggas who doubted
I take yo head then I mound it
Don't give a fuck who allow it
You ain't on the map, I'm rerouting
Rockin '2-3', fuck a stylist
He say I'm so bad, I'm childish
Hundreds comin out the ATM, I bet I still double count it
I pop out and it's a pep rally
Young legend, so the best signed me
I'm cool, but the sack grimey
Been winnin, I don't even check the tallies
Been winnin, I don't even check the tallies
Got a new crib, just moved to Cali
But I'm still grinding, til the crew shining

No Good,Schizo ,2014.0,"See I know, I know, yea
You're no good, yea you're no good
But you're so good, feel so good
You're no good but you're so good to me
You're my addiction, you're my addiction
You're no good but you're so good to me

A heartbeat's the perfect harmony
And pardon me but you became a part of me
Replace blood for your love in my arteries
Kind of drug they don't sell up in the pharmacy
I told him I'm in pieces, he told me he took pottery
Scratchin' exes off to win the lottery
You not on the TV but you a star to me
Cause you be scripted like a movie and it's starring me
But still I rap for him til I gas out
Even though we been around like he got passed out
He like the thots on the block with they ass out
But like him find me with a nigga, he gon' lash out
Got a soft  but grew up in the hood
Scared of commitment, rollin' on the wood
Might just be bad but he make it feel good
Addicted I wouldn't leave him if I could


Bad bitches got a nigga up to no good
I was on the label, damn I should know good
Good pussy, good head, a beautiful mind
Good with numbers, a dime know what to do with a nine
Like I just bought a rollie spendin' quality time
You be sayin' ""it's yours"" cause you tryna be mine
We go through the bullshit but you keepin' it tight
Yo I'm on that healthy shit so I'm eatin' you right
Like a thief in the night, stealin' your heart
Even when there's friction, you feelin' the sparks
In the dark you my dancer, like you from Atlanta
Girl you the shit, that's why I gotta pamper
You know and like The Roots, I gotta get my bands up
I lay down the laws, but girl I don't handcuff
Man stuff I be on, back  in the basement
Your insecurities, I got the combination and it's good",https://genius.com/Dreezy-no-good-lyrics

Cole Hearted,UnKnown,UnKnown,":
See I'm the girl with broken pieces
Always stayed around when I didn't have a reason
You cut me deep but I ignored all of the bleeding
Emotions you was teasing you the only one I needed
Well atleast what if felt like Relationship was all wrong but it felt right
And when my strength was all gone I still held tight
And with my pillows and tears only at night
And I know them girls was on you but I thought you'd choose me
But you just hurt me cause you know you wouldn't loose me
Stop blaming me like im the villian I put you first regardless of how I was fucking feelin'
And every girl that come after me won't compare to me
You going realize it and regret you wasn't there for me
So you can go and try your hardest to replace me
But im still in your heart you can't erase me
:
And I was stupid arm wrestling with cupid
Ignored all the signs but in my heart I always new it
You was more than just my lover
You more than just my friend but sometimes bests friends have to end
Why you so cole hearted?
You just so cole hearted
I think its time we both parted
Somebody's leaving broken hearted
Look what you started
:
I mistook a down bitch for a dumb bitch
And you mentally was keep making me cum bitch
You fake the whole relationship go be an actor
And any girl thats after won't even be a factor
And love is good when a nigga feel you
But when they dont it'll be that weapon that will kill you
But for some reason I was thinking I had 9 lives , I gave 9 trys , I gave 9 crys , I died 9 times
So how the fuck you saying you leaving me
As much as I was there for you bitch you should be pleasing me
You can't even talk to me but quick to let you semen speak
Karma is a bitch so be care you going be needing me
Don't act like you ain't custom to the real me
Don't push me out you life like ain't feel me
And now you alway fucked up I miss the sober you
I don't want to but its time for me to get over you

Late nights with my bro
And my homies callin me
Like where ya at
Yeah I read the messages
But never sent one back
Now I'm at the parties
No way home
Least I'm with my dukes
Never spend a night alone

Started from the bottom
We still here
Started from the bottom
And we still fucking standing here
Started from the bottom
We still here
Started from the bottom

Back back up in the days

Its on display
My vision won't happen over night
You gotta wait
That's just how it goes
Write my own ish
Never singing ghost
Killa call me Blizz
Crowd of people mobbin' me
And women takin pictures
Dad wanna see me bank
Paper cut fingers
But I don't really have
That type of patience
To convince him
I'm a good kid
Never had problem drinking
Always fly straight
My turn signal never blinking
My team's been working hard
Ready for the new season

We don't need them
We still youngins
So we kick out feet back
