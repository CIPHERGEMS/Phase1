Life Story,Life Story,2000,"The world ain't no different now
The world ain't no different now

Never had a dime, my life a crime
Had to be when I was nine, Moms drunk off wine
Running with all kinds her mind stayed in the stupor
'til the point she paid no mind to the super
Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles
Stayed on the growl and eating once and a while
First day of school never had nothing too style
Mister Colondre stressing, I ain't coming in a while
It was a bummer, rocking the shit I rocked all summer
On the first day, I was feeling some kind of way
And she wasn't trying to do nothing, you would think
For the sake of the kids, she'd enroll in school or something
Now I know then was even harder
'specially for a single mother raising me with no father
Shit living up in this tenement, eating stale Entenmann's
Talking wild shit to Spanish immigrants
I speak in codes, man tú sabe
Always! Cállate! Bendición to my madre
Even though she never did nothing for me
Acknowledge me as I run down my life story

You don’t know, how crazy it is outside
I’ve died inside so many times
Oh, I’ve cried, oh, I’ve cried

Check the skit, nobody never gave me shit
If anything a nigga framed me and made me get
3 to 6 my first bid, no doubt up in Spofford
Had to be 12 son, trying to make a profit
Remembering robbed my Moms with no guilt
Eating pork and beans, old corn flakes with no milk
Bitter, in school I smacked cats in a hurry
Moms ain't care she busy getting drunk with Mrs. Berry
On the first floor, I used to thirst for greenery
Picking pockets with Seth and Jay from 106th Street
Yo, fuck home, I'm tired of getting punched in my dome
Tired of hearing this faggot-ass nigga moan, I started roaming
My hustle game is deep, cats ya heard
From San Fran back to Manhattan to Newburg
Notorious tell your friends to spread the word
Glorious, my life story is absurd

You don’t know, how crazy it is outside
I’ve died inside so many times
Oh, I’ve cried, oh, I’ve cried
I know I haven’t been the best
I’ve shown you things you shouldn’t have seen
Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? Oh, my baby

Home from Elmira, got a little brighter
I'mma keep it real still a schemer and conniver
Recognize the struggle, living like a thug do
Hatred in my heart but inside I love you
See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you
Knowing that I'm just like you, I am like the double
All I wanna know is how you pound me down
Yo, this shit is real and you really jerked me around
But any way I am getting paid with Puff now
'Bout to cop you a house I can send you some stuff now
So many levels jail take you
I appreciate jail 'cause it made me appreciate you
I've been through fire and brimstone
Used to be diplomas in jail, now I cop the gem stone
I remembered when you rushed me
The time you said you should of flushed me, I forgive you ma trust me

You don’t know, how crazy it is outside
I’ve died inside so many times
Oh, I’ve cried, oh, I’ve cried
I know I haven’t been the best
I’ve shown you things you shouldn’t have seen
Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? Oh, my baby",https://genius.com/Black-rob-life-story-lyrics

Uhh Black Rob shit
Y'all don't know?
Uhh Uhh
Danegerous niggas
Lil Kim and Black Rob yelowman
P Diddy , the moment you all been waitin for
Murder yeah , ha ha yeah

What y'all riffin about, hang em like they did in the South
Dead wit ya dick in ya mouth
Now what this shit is about, niggas sleepin
Like I won't slip in ya house, and put my dick in your spouse
Till you get home, I'm lamped like a part of ya couch
Then sit on me, that's what I'mma spit filthy
Pretty swiftly, til them coppers come and get me
Tried to tell his coward ass it's real
Actin like I can't get through that Slomen Shield
I'm a veteran, I'll take leathers and furs in front of him
Safe cracker, moved from New York to Jers
Still sending ?kites with birds?
Nothin's heard, feds wanna tap my word
Take vehicles off curbs, tools off herbs, jewels off of all you nerds
You swerve, I splurge with all yall riches
Comin to joke and blind all yall bitches
Give respect where respect is due
Keep frontin, and I'mma put the tech to you
Coward
CHORUS: Lil Kim and Black Rob
Dame espacio
Man back up off me
Dame espacio
Can I get a minute to breathe?
Dame espacio
That means give me space
Dame espacio
Damn back up off me

Like I'm just talking like I never did these things
Snatch chains and rings, teddy bears from siblings
I did things some of yall cowards might not imagine
Like run in the stores, gun drawn, spasm
Press the button bitch I'm not havin
Or it'll your super employee leave in a bag and
Black wagon, bait boy I'm not braggin
It's a promise, I'll take em to school like Nastradamus
It's my thing do what I do best
Want the treasure chest, and that dough in your girl breasts
How dare you try to stash yours in your drawls
What's mines is mines, what's yours ain't yours
Get his whip, watch how quickly I paint yours
Watch poppi and them, hit it up with the paintballs
Coward niggas, got the gall, thinkin I won't lamp in the hall
Like New Year's and drop the ball, bitches!
CHORUS

Where I come from, we all got guns
Be a hundred of yall and we still won't run
Call the cops, they still won't come
We bang on niggas like we playin the drums
These cats think they know me Black
Well I hit em over the head and say ""Homey don't play that""
Listen to they rhymes and say didn't I say that?
Damn, I'm the shit, it's like I'mma nigga they be bitin my dick
Get on some old school shit, bitch run your kicks
Go on y'all can have my flow
I extort y'all hoes for all yall dough
And by now I think all yall know
Who's the winner, still champ by 
T.K.O.

I Dare You,Life Story,2000,"I dare you
(Uh, Harlem Underworld)
To come against me
(Harlem Underworld)
I dare you
(Black Rob)
To defeat me
(Watch the whole thing unfold)
I dare you
(From 100th street)
To come for me
(To 200th)
You won't win
(Manhattan)

Nigga's got me sittin' on the roof
Eye trained, on scope, blessin' 100 proof
Hand on toast, 'bout to roast
Some kids who flash like they assassins
Picked up my dough and b-ked this honey passin'
Got the spot on lock
Taking flicks around the corner
She made it where the spot ain't hot
Like a potato, she got five-oh on the payroll
They sniffin' yayo, I don't know what to say, yo
There they go in front of the store
Dressed in black shit
Some like theys are meaner
If they be hustlin' backwards—fuck 'em
Can't even do one thing, assassinate 'em
That's it, that's all, solo
Single, no more, no less, shots rang, yo
Money caught one in his Kangol
D.O.A. as his man made his run for the door
Caught 'em in the 'gaitor shoes his girl probably bought him
Too bad, Black ain't get the chance to extort him
Cuz niggas like that don't deserve to live
Word the myth
And we ain't got no love to give
For these drop shots who wanna be down
Wanna be clowns, the fail ones
I like how all that good shit sounds
And I dare one

I dare you
To come against me
I dare you
To defeat me
I dare you
To conquer me
You won't win

Nigga, I slay, you pray, kill that ass uptown
Dump yo' bitch ass back around your way
When I'm in one of those moods I can give a fuck
I mean cool, run and bungie jump off the fuckin' roof
I hear voices calling me, givin' me fits
Singing tonight's the night Black Rob, let's write these hits
In the halls of death, you get left, I'm in the top 10
Even Rocky trainer and his wife said you can't win
Scream battle, but you never fought
That's like me sayin' I got five, never ran a full court
Stab the devil in his belly, took his Pelle Pelle
Blew the spot down and slid straight to the tele
I see envious eyes, envious guys, different states
Mad we seein', different cake
Rob me, tear that asshole out of place
’Cause in the end, I'm the head case you gotta face
And I dare one


It feels good not to be dealin' with petty cash
Me and D-Dot all we seein' now is ready cash
And ready ass, splash in the Jacuzzi
Honey from the movies, south notch cutie
Used to go to Howard with D at the homecomin'
On my way from Kakalak
Me and Merse was gun running
Musta done something all conspicuous
Eye of the tiger, I know these cats are sick of this
Ridiculous sayin' these cats don't love Black
This is Bad Boy, I put it where it 'posed to be at
Lemme know where to put your rosary at
My enemies, I let 'em get a load of me gat
Fine, you don't believe Black real official
Playa way, get your mom's cake, and kiss you
You leavin', wasn't part of this plan
Understand it's all about the Bengi's man
And I dare one",https://genius.com/Black-rob-i-dare-you-lyrics
Jasmine,Life Story,2000,"(Verse One)
Yo had me in the LQ
Yo shit was mad bumpin
Rappers on the mic was like settin off somethin
Now parties like this yo god
I like lougin observin everything inside my surrounding
Jasmine dancin wit this non-descrip sucka
Okay cool as long as the sucka don't touch her
Ya know
Get the urge and can't control his hand
Get a body bag cause ""mauh"" he's a dead man
She was coolin sportin my cable
When the dance was done she like walked back to money's table
I sat there like shit I can't believe this
I wish you was there big fella so you could see this bitch
Sittin there boo legs wide open laughin gigglin smilin and jokin wit homes
Like they use to hang out real real tough
He musta had a strong rap cause Jasmine looked gased up
Sittin there played the role of a slouch
Just watchin to see how Jasmine played herself out
They sat there just talkin to each other
I thought this kid was alone he had five more brothas wit him
Wit out girl's now ain't this some shit
If she don't recognize the game they can kiss this shit
They introduced theyselves one at a time
Saw 'em say how you doin so Jasmine say ""fine""
I was laughin but there was more in store
I saw her get up start walkin towards the front door
I rolls too god and walked right behind em
So where ever they go it won't be hard to find em
I keep a guard you now I thought I better
Plus I keep the stash deep inside the 8 pound leather
Open doors vale was on the ready
At the end Jasmine's gonna wish she never met me
We're off two cars speedin deep in the night
I'm doin 30 on the straight away 60 on the turnpike
For Jasmine
(Chorus)
Playa freeze while I pull out my nine
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh
Playa freeze while I pull out my nine
Know that i've got Jasmine on my mind
Ohhhhh
(Verse Two)
Word up ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still chasin them suckas in the '86 Jetta
Thinkin different thoughts still not understandin
How 7 people got in that fuckin Volkswagen
Enough of that god yo back to the chase
Yo man you should've seen the ruckus look on my face
Slowin down cruisin on the cool out mode
Then parked in front of his house on Gunhill road
Man I started to get out
Grabbed the rope and try to hang her
Before I let this posse drop shots gang bang her
They went inside man but I kept goin
Parked across the street wit out them even knowin
Got out the car I'm still schemin the house
Tip toed around the back quiet like a church mouse
If the neighbors looked out the window
They would surely get leerly and scream like ""BAHANDO""
Police they would hold my fate
But they didn't so I creeped up the fire escape
I saw shadow's inside a bright lit room
Which appear to be two bodies dancin to a slow tune nigga
I got closer decided I should check it
I saw Jasmine and one of them kids dancin buck naked
So I got the gat so I have no interference
When I make my grand appearance
For Jasmine
(Chorus)
(Verse Three)
I seen a red dot tryna lock on me
I can't believe these niggas tryna pull a pac on me
I admit they had the drop on me
Probably turned the burner around 20 degrees
So I could see
Who rushed me
Who knocked me out
Who tried to choke
Who tied the rope
Who left me this bitch ass note
I'm disgusted the murder she wrote
Money she oaked all of my coke all of dope
Up in smoke
Made you follow me probably so mad you wanna hollow me
But you won't be so lucky today so swallow me
Got your GS4 and your Bently rose took all of your clothes
And 99 bottles of Mo's
What she didn't know is about the dynamite in the rose
And if I get close I'll blow it cause I got the controls
At the toll on the phone wit this bitch Nicole
Said she left you in some hotel out in the road
Room 112 penthouse sweet alumni
On the 12th floor in front of her door was one guy
On some Brandon Lee shit he wasn't handin me shit
Understand me he flipped bust the 9 and he split
Had my heat cocked busted right through the sheet rock
How'd he drop he ain't the nigga I just shot
What's goin on all of a sudden it was nothin no jokin son
Jasmine holdin the smokin gun
By the time I realized I caught two in the chest had the vest
As I fell I'm not thinkin of death
Still fallin to a place remote conscience though
Long enough to see her aim and put one in her throat
So I got up all shot up grabbed the Prada
Faggots probably towed my truck
You know how my luck
Hoped in bleedin to death turned left
Thought of Jasmine and how she went out to the death
For Jasmine
(Chorus)",https://genius.com/Black-rob-jasmine-lyrics

Like Vince Price when I flash my steel
They can't touch
Won't touch
Never touch
Drivin' around with the toast in they whip, never bust
Puffin dust like fiends
I mean, I want green ya shifty
Cop the big eight fifty, with the gleam
My team
Full of cut throats, with enough notes to write a fuckin' book
Take a good fuckin' look at these bad guys
Stay mad fly, mad high
In the Ford Expedi' and I don't expect to die
On some humble shit
I am on some rumble shit
When it's on you should see the shit I come through with
If you scared by a dog release the four by fours
I heard when faggot ass Don died he shit in his draws
On the streets black good like allstate, ya all fake
Just got paid but, fuck it I want some more cake
Y'all faith, in my hand
Now ya nervous man and drive my brains quick fast, at ya service

When I shake, they feel earthquakes in eight states
Oh trait, off the Richter, drunk
Off the liquor
Shot towards you mister
Off course it hit you, hard
It gets hard, I pick the card
Any card, any problem I'mma hit your squad
Eyes on the shapar when I twisted god
You think you got it all together
Get it ripped apart
Man you can't stand the heat
Stay up outta the street
Nigga turnt po-lice 'cause they shot at his jeep
I subtract like mad
Don't make me blast
I want it all, fuck half
Don't make me laugh

Get this money, it's all green

And I wished that y'all would

Muscle Game,Life Story,2000,"Yeah, ah
Ah-oh, startin' to feel this
Ah, yeah, startin' to feel it (nigga, this crazy)
Yo, who these cats think they is
Takin' they business 'round here?
Yo, dawg, don't even go there
This is ours, we built this from the ground on up
Now it's flowers, I think you best to round on up
Your entourage, slim chance of y'all gettin' large
It's non-cipher, that's because B R's in charge of the set here
Cats is known for gettin' wet here, and left here
Till the cops come pick us up

Steppin' in territory that's corrupt
Pushin' your luck
Intrudin' where shit's already sewed up, nigga fold up
You and your two amigos'll get slain
This ain't the place to try to gain fame from
You gets burnt in the streets a nigga worked hard to make
And I'll be damned if I let another brother take it alive for his own sake
They better vacate promptly
Before they get they ass stomped
Listen, take heed to what we sayin' niggas

It's all in the muscle (muscle game)
It's all in the muscle (muscle game)
If you don't have the muscle (muscle game)
And you gotta have muscle (muscle game) (We lay down the muscle game)
You see, in this game, only the strong will survive, and the weak shall pass
See, a lot of cats think with they brawn, not with they brain. Ha
C'mon, man. Fuck with me, I'll drop a million dollars on your head
Erase you and your whole family. Beeyatch. Come on. Now that's muscle

We won't lie, sometimes we stick 'em up
Last time it wasn't us, though, word
Like some hoes did 'em up
And nine Glocks hit 'em up
How I know it was your dough?
Cuz I was right there when they split it up
See I could tell you where to find the corpse
But that cheddar, I'm afraid, dawg, that's gone forever

Greed for wealth got us stingy
We got a spot that's hot, niggas envy
The fact we clock mad dough
They wanna see us shut down, but no
I don't think so, the crew is still rakin' in the cash flow
For every dimebag sold on this block, we want in
One slung behind the back, it's under the skin
When niggas try to step to the block and bogard
We can't see it happenin', warned them first, ""Get the fuck out of Dodge""
Better believe that, test it, and see if we don't put you on your back, niggas

It's all in the muscle (muscle game)
And you gotta have muscle (muscle game)
If you don't have the muscle (muscle game)
And you gotta have muscle (It's all in the muscle game. We lay down the muscle game)
See, talk is cheap, but Bad Boys move in silence. You ain't even gon' hear me comin'. Ha ha. You just gonna wake up with a bunch of angels flyin' around your head. You feel me? You're dealin' with another type of muscle

Now bein' that it's all out war
I'm bringin more than that 4-4 (Come on, take that, take that, take that, take that)
Watch me dispose of all y'all
Y'all fraud-ass niggas, tape-made-me-bored-ass niggas
Gun-bigger-than-sword-ass niggas
Now enter in the ring, gun drawn, makin' moves like pawns
Two at a time, comin' for mine like it's on, nigga, CBS
He can't be serious, Finesse
He don't believe I keep a gun under the vest

You think you can destroy this empire we built from scratch, you're stupid
I wouldn't care how ruthless your crew is
We got defense for this area
Try to attack, mad niggas on the barriers
Just dyin' to blast back, bitch
There'll be no givin' and no takin', definitely no breakin'
Laws we lay down, here's the situation:
Severe torture is what those who offend us face
I show no love for a punk-ass nigga we hate
Tryin' to pay me no brow and then come up missin'?
Happens to hardheaded niggas when they don't listen
I gave you fair warnin' bout the danger you're messin' with
A stranger invadin' a street corner is a goner
Try me if you think it's a lie, the attitude many niggas have
But in the process many die
Thinkin' they can step to the block and bogard
I couldn't see it happenin', warned 'em first, ""Get the fuck outta Dodge""
(""Get the fuck outta Dodge"")

And you gotta have muscle
And you gotta have muscle (it's all in the muscle game)
If you don't have the muscle
And you gotta have muscle (it's all in the muscle game)
This is our game right here. We ain't playin' with you weak niggas. Come on, now. I been doin' this for too long, man. If you ain't got the muscle, better have that hustle. It's 1999. No more mister nice guy. I've been nice too long. I'm just gon' start makin' y'all niggas disappear, man. First, I'm gonna take your records off the radio, then I'm gon' motherfuckin' erase your social security number, you know, take your birth certificate out of the file. I'm gonna do that to your whole fucking family, I ain't gonna have no mercy for you. You understand? Come on, mister nice guy. If you ain't got the muscle, you'd better have the hustle, or keep your motherfuckin' mouth shut, beeyatch
If you don't have the muscle
And you gotta have muscle",https://genius.com/Black-rob-muscle-game-lyrics

Hot beats and hot rhymes tossed in a blenda'
I want ch'all to feel hardcore, nothin tenda'

Y'all can't see the Rob, uh-uhh, y'all must be stupid
If I owe Shawn Combs any money then I recouped it
I looped it, this fly shit from ?Nebogada?
Me and Yogi and Hard Pierre from You Dont Know Me
I dare you to come against me
, run against me
Use your gun against me, you finito, finished
I've seen wild cats diminished, foldin for, Bad Boy's known to ball
Internationally, I'm sayin actually
I have to be the next cat to go and sell a million records casually
So, prepare yourself for the storm, Nineteen-nine-nine its on
And I'm just gettin warm

You Don’t Know Me,Life Story,2000,"1- 
You have never seen my face before
You don't know me
Oh, no
You will never see my face again
You don't know me
Oh, no

You've never seen the gloves of an Uptown thug
You say I move drugs, cuz my shit is unplugged
Everywhere I go, results hound our love
Black gon' bless them like the heavens up above
Catch me in the new wave cab with ten bags of that Dro'
The shit you grow in H20
Got beef so I'm taking it slow, making it grow
Right now my main concern is making it blow
Guns and ammo, man, yo, you gots to understand, yo
I'm not the one that hit them with the banjo
Here y'all is, bringing my fingerprints
Up in them cameras and shit like I fucked a singing bitch out
Ask her if she seen my face
Right: Look- I was out of town getting cake with Moore and Little Shake
Wasn't even out here in New York State
Trying to play me like a goat, like my name was Scape
Now you mad, son
Repeat 1
Called a nigga sleepin', outside creepin'
We out in Mexico, for a fun-filled weekend
At least I thought I was, they had the whole place bugged
Still thinkin' I sold drugs, ice 'em up
Kick the door in, I fire escape 'em
From up top, bullets soaring, but I fake 'em
I'm hard to hit, Spanish speaking chick that constantly
And Mafia connections, chopping niggas, it's hard to get
Hit me with the 411, and a gun
Envelope, and transfered funds from Big Pun
Conversation, job well done
This shit is lifestyle now, shit, I do it all for fun
Rippin' the frames, got at least 20 different names
Know at least 20 different games with different lames
Not to mention liftin' Lane's credit cards and passports
Slayin' and flat on asphalt, still
Y'all don't know
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
I'm in the cell now, it's hell now, all stuffy
Seven numbers, told Harve to call Puffy
Say they got his man locked down in sick town
Gotta get him out, not now but right now
Catch him when they shift him when they open the yard
Hurry up, before these six rounds smokin' the guard
On the humble, I'mma just lay up for y'all to come through
Create a diversion; me, I start a rumble
Holdin' me, they ain't even take my flick
Got on Simmy's, they ain't even take my shit
Got my jewels, blended right in with these fools
On the sneak out, the peek out, had two left shoes
I'mma freak 'em, through the front gate, on administrations
All they felt was a gust of wind, still no facin'
Standing by the Crystal Lake, like I'm Jason
All they felt was a gust of wind, still no facin'
You late

Thug Story,Life Story,2000,"Heeeeeeerrrreeee we go...
Once upon a time not long ago
When I was outta town movin work with Zo
I used to bring my nigga B.R
And niggas with the burna's holdin' down B-R
There lived a jealous kid that was mislead
By anotha jealous kid who wanted me dead
(He said) Me and you are gonna push this rock
Once we kill Rob we takin over the block
They did the job, but didn't suceed
When I got up off the ground niggas couldn't believe
They started bustin and'a bustin filled my ribs like crusting
Had the vest on so it didn't mean nothin
One kid grabbed a tech and started sprayin erratic
But he fell, two slugs from my semi-automatic
Ran two blocks there was cops all over
Then I dipped into the building ???
Banged on the door of apartment 83
Some lady start screamin like she was afraid of me
Ran to the roof like ""Fuck that sista""
Ask an old man ""Can you help me mista?""
Got to the roof clutchin my four-four
Open up the door, yo guess who I saw (Who?)
Black and ?Deaf? now, ain't this proper
Guns drawn full of ??? toward the helicopter
Escaped alive but my ribs was shattered
Body all battered, and clothes all tattered
Deep in my heart I wanted revenge
But I let the shit slide til I saw 'em again
Pulled out my guns and released a clip (And)
Thats the way I gotta end this shit
He was only one fiend, tryin to live a thugs dream
Slugs to the chest, shoulda heard him scream
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
'Cuz anyone of us could catch the blood bath
Straight an' narrow is how niggas should live...live
Good night...good night
Knock 'em out the box Black

I just woke up in pain, my ribs broke up
Wifey on the side like Justin, shes kept the hope up
All thats on my mind is revenge revenge
Just then a few dogs kicked the door off the hinge
Go with the drawers on, man its cold as shit
Had the mag by the table, nigga hold this shit
He was one stupid nigga tryin roll for 'Delph
Not knowin that he might get killed himself
Now wifey being trained by the F.O.I
It was horrible, stabbed the otha cat in his eye
He was screamin tryin grab her actin like he had to have her
Swept him off his feet but got sliced with the dagger
Well in these times, well atleast to me
No true niggas rollin come in sets of three
And they won't stop rollin til you let them see
All the permanent scars that the tech nine leaves
Barely out the crib caught one in the leg
Couldn't even get my ??? had to leave 'em for dead (Damn)
That's cold, yeah I know, but the cold in the streets
The one who escaped is the one holdin the heat
Before I breeze grab coke out the freeze
By the time y'all hear this I'll be somewhere in Belize
With some bad asian chick layin between my knees
While I'm blowin off some trees, pumpin B.I.G.'s
Greastest hits, this was my latest shit
Watch how niggas act when they play this shit
This a lesson, shits for real no dressing
No ?lip? infestin, crab cats I'm addressin
Bad Boy, the 44 Mag, fresh off the rack
All you cowards and nasty ass hoes step the fuck back
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
'Cuz anyone of us could catch the blood bath
Straight an' narrow is how niggas should live...live
Good night...good night
Knock 'em out the box Black

Down the Line Joint,Life Story,2000,"Verse One: Puffy
When night falls, that's when it all begins
Be prepared we can allow no loose ends
I highly recommend ya'll bring your arms
This is no false alarm
They want to do us harm
Like I'm nervous, live inside a glass house
They want to bring us down
Then drag us out
It's all about niggas that doubt our reputation
Startin conflict and don't know what they facing
Want twist us all in there black magic
? suggest paper of wars and break havoc
Are you ready, don't sleep on them
Ain't petty, you get that ass thrown like confetti
Meet me at the getaway spot in a jiffy
Leave all the does behind that act iffy
We got maneuvers, that's hard to beat
Till the other side retreats
Under six feet beneath
C'mon
Verse Two: Mark Curry
I told u that is a saw I wore
I'm a kill
When the rebel yells song that don't stop till
It's done, see I got guns and I m sick
See how you said meet me here and I came quick
Them same catz on the most wanted list
We can hit them, Then straight disappear in the mist
?,Won't cease to exist
I shoot to kill and I'll be damned if I miss
A warrior waiting for Armageddon
I get serious as hell when I'm threatened
Intent to get hostile break into a rage of fury
Send them back their apostle's fossils and crazed right
A rude awakening and but now I'm alert
And that's right down my line of work
The whole Brotherhood new verse, gutless cowards with no back
And watch how they all fall flat
Ahh
Chorus:
Niggas gone fall out
They got us up against the wall
Here to call out, let it all out
With or without you I'm for war
Some shit's worth dying for, ah-huh
Niggas gone fall out
They got us up against the wall
Here to call out, let it all out
With or without you I'm for war
Some shit's worth dying for, ah-huh
Verse Three: Black Rob
Yo
You want hot soup, I got shit like up on in Attica
Guns ridiculous like Battlestar Galactica
What's this, want to insult my family?
La Familia, actin like ones of us gonna kill ya
I want ya'll dues
Shit hit the fan, we going to be eatin' your food
Time up in the new
Then torture, I rip a niggas toe nails off
What, I didn't here the news five slayin the law
Man, how I don't want do these catz
I lay mousetraps for those mice house niggas that house gats
They want to out me, I know killers from down south be
Who know and understand, there ain't a thing sweet about me
I earn my respect, and I was born to wreck
Spit techs, by your rockets threw jets
Who's next, to get hit by firepower that's so raw
Go play 4-4's ready for war
Verse Four: Mase
All out, what what
Wanna blow, what what
Teamsters what what
Mother Fucker
]From Monday to Sunday, it's all about the money
Nigga ain't got mine, I guarantee I'm gun play
Moms says ""Mase, you gon need that money one day""
Bitch I'm in the jet, Benz on the runway
Don't be fooled, still squeeze tools
Money like that, why the fuck I need school
M-A dollar sign-E rules
Hundred G jewels
Vacate places you don't even need shoes
Same catz say stay up, prey 4 my day up
No one where my bitch live, plot where I lay up
If you got coke way up, Got doe then pay up
Niggas shoot at me a nigga better spray up
Cause God forbid, you hit me in my Ribs and I live
Comin back and getting you and your kids

Verse Five: G-Dep
Dom Dom Dom
Thought I heard something
Last cat that I heard frontin
Burned up herb huntin
Word cause, my heard something
Splurge something
Now I don't care who I hit
Its who I hit I knew I hit
Who would understand though
We vandals and land roles
Program for our own channels
And flannel, this man knew any clan
We're here for the catz in the minivan
Gotta let this schemmie plan
Pay me man, scan
Sex, cars any money
Sex guard the money
With this gun, it be hard to run me
Get it right, or get it tonight
Better tonight
Set up your wife, with the head of the night
Don't fold cause my goals imbedded with ice
To my tents dimming the light

Nobody knew where he came from, or got his name from
All we know is he killed Keith with the same gun
He used on Terrell, and Tone from outta jail
Now he see us, we livin' and gettin' a lot a mail
Watch that cat, send thugs to stop that cat!
But niggas like him always got the gat
Gotta take 'em off, gotta break 'em off real soon
Call them two hoes we hit in Cancun, get them a room
At the Radison over Madison
I'm imaginin' somewhere down the line I'mma have to use my gat again
I'm alright with stayin' up all night
And puffin' dark chocolate trees til the dark turns light
That nigga seen us, you actin like there's no beef between us
Act like he ain't got people swayin' the dope fiends around the corner
You fluffed my man, he got me on a
Whole 'notha level, money-grippers are goners

Made them hoes approach duke on some ""How ya doin shit""
Small talk made 'em walk out, thinkin with his *Silence* (Sho' man)
Just like I thought, he about to get caught
They goin all out in the backseat suckin 'em off
Cee-Lo, stay close dogg, we ain't tryin to lose 'em (Alright)
Only thing on my dome is what I'm gon' do to 'em
He killed Keith, I knew that playa since he was small
When he used to ball, and mess with molly down the hall
Now he ghost, and this crab nigga's to blame
Gotta slug him with his dig, I'mma put in his brain
But slow down, he's pullin over, park right behind that Nova
If duke wake up, put 36 in his Rover, cut the motor
He tryin to draw attention to us
This ain't the time baby boy, this is about to blow up
Synchronize ya Rol' up, we got one minute to rock it

Fresh off the plane I'm in New York vacationing
Come on, lets get gone, nigga it's on again
Swervin' in the rain, and workin' the wood grain
We did about two hundred, glide us into an S-lane
Now feel the pain
And if it's affectin' you it involves me in it
And its all great cause I ain't got on a nigga's ass in a minute
We've established innocence, nigga, this Benz ain't rigged
It's easy, accelerate and make those twenties rotate
The corner cowboy invented Hennessy, straight
Satisfaction, in the midst of all the interaction
I sense tension, here
And some nigga over there's givin us his undivided attention
Aiyyo Rob yo, is that this nigga (Who?)
Is that this nigga that been 'round here fuckin with'choo?
Want you want me to do?
Who you want me to run over, and run through?
With my gun drew, and unleash my wrath upon you
We can battle, but nigga, but pay for the bad news is true
This nigga done did somethin' that he can't undo
And anybody who came here with him deserves one too
Is it true? Fuckin' up my good clothes on you scandalous hoes
I suppose that these bullet holes will make ya widow keep the casket closed
How yo kids gonna get gave back to you? That's how it goes

Yeah ya-, ya-, y'all thought we was gonna stay away for a long time
So what you gon do now?
Sorry, let's go

Yo Black Rob makin all stops we gon party till this motherfucking ball drops
Snatchin all props
Switchin gears on the Ducati , cats schemin prob'ly
But we ain't tryin na hurt nobody (we ain't tryin na hurt nobody)
We just tryin na make it clear , there B.R. is here
And we come to lock it down this year
So without further ado , we bring to you (without further ado)
You highness , (your highness) , Black Rob , Spanish Harlem's finest

I be the PD world tourer , Harlem horror
Catch me in a Lex 470 or the Explorer
The underworld figure , mo morals
Small shit it's only room to get bigger and spread love on my niggas
I figure I'm the best thing since ham and grits
That shit flip it , it's off the hook , it's unlisted
The wizard like Juwan Howard
I drop the bomb when you want test the Don power
It's on dude , I warned you before the wildin
My team some sick cats fresh from Ward's Island
I'm sayin , I try to tell em how I do due to the fact you
Was duckin my debut , duckin the ginsu
B.R., natural born threat
He got his tech and I ain't even put it on yet
Just imagine, me and you toe to toe back of the paddywagon
To the death, till one of us got no breath left
Protect that neck

I roll with soldiers, quick to run pass and snuff you
Regulate the streets of BK with brass knuckles
At last stuck you, and your so called team
Them so called mean, cats sound like Ben Vareen
Caught me, diggin in the scene, 115, Lex minivan light green
Watching my cream, stopping my cream
Shit's been tried before, my shit's stress, with no lactose at all
I mean I'm just limpin, cuz right now I see the profit
Show me some grams I chop it, show me some land I cop it
Show me some ho somewhere in the tropics
And I'mma suck the pussy till she beg me to stop it
That's real, I'mma tell you how the black man feel
Pack toast but still catch him with the backhand steel
Pimp status, while you run around with shrimp status
Got a gat and decided to clap at least twenty right at us
We ain't mad though, we got the bulletproof dough
And that's the way my niggas roll, if you was seein his dough
You'd be the same baby
CHORUS

Yo when I walk up in the place all eyes is on me
Is it me, or the hundred grand worth of icy
Can't underestimate me I beg your pardon
If y'all ain't had guns I probably woudn't of brought my squadron
But unfortunately it's that war outside
And I still roll with bulletproof doors on my ride
They call me PD, holy like Koran
Rockin Sean John, poppin Sean Don
Fucking ghetto Don Juan
Top of the world, watch me snatch your hood treasure
Might have to check a few cats for good measure
Playboy you know the drilly, y'all cats is real silly
What I gotta do sell another ten milly
It's crazy how they all fall down, all balls down
It's hectic so I send Black to come and check it
Ain't shit changed, same shit stains, in the business
Approach me, play me closely, hopin hopefully (keep hopin)
Before I slip I let you know that I'm on to ya
Your hands'll never touch my Bad Boy formula
And this year, I'm gonna hit em severe

It's no act yo, no
This chick can keep my dick between her cheek and gums, like tobacco
On the F.D.R. doin like 90 a pop
Fuck five-0 niggas too grimey to stop

Think we care if you, you, you, roll behind us or not?
I'm the one man army, the one hand on the tommy
If you standing next to me, one hand on your mommy

And I be like shhh, thats why the Feds dont wanna talk to Rob
Yall had to go force the god, naw I ain't got nothin to prove
Ain't gotta carry the two, see my daddy told me bury them fools
And remember this rule: don't fuck with niggas that ain't fuckin with you
So when you're home with nothin to do
Just get comfortable, cause they ain't doin nothin to you
And they can take it like they wanna take it, I ain't just a rapper

Sucked my dick so well I took her on tour, bitch was so raw

Passed it off to Puff and Loon, wit no delayin
The average nigga walk around here sad
Get the chronic now he honest he gon' bust that ass
Get home, she ain't there, bitch musta mashed
And she caught you for furs and your jewels and cash
Shoulda known it
Me, I could never condone it
Bum bitch walk around my shit like she own it
She got some bitch niggas involoved, they be in cars
That used to shoot dice in back of the ?m rob?
All praise due to them papers, got me watchin my neighbors
If I dont know you do me no favors
And thats comin from the horses mouth, reppin east west and south
Nigga front we airin him out
Old timer said ""Don't leave the label 'til you're paid
And hold yours down from the cradle to the grave""
Sharp as the cut the barber gave you with the shave
Handgun, but you harder wit the gauge
So go ahead front for us, we savage
It's war, consider this collateral damage
And we even did some joints in spanish
We control the entire zone and punks sayin ?bi amon?

Your man Black on the rise
Address the lies as those who plan my demise
Through the white man's eyes, I came through with guys
The same guys who gave the whole hood pies, this was back in '95
How the lame dudes lie
Talking about how I changed my strive, when I was locked inside Brothers identified
Understand they only getting three tries, then the heat gon' fly
Now it's me, you and I
Top of the world, but it's still do or die, can't wait for you to fry
As I scream ""bye, bye""
I notified, personified, who am I? The occasional fly?
Mr. Fourth of July
Sometimes Mr. Shoe, Shirt and Tie
Get the loot, hit'em high, big sevens slurve by
And people like it's the nerve of I
Nothin' worse than I

I came home from doin' time, it's do or die, ain't losing
I've been roaming through and wide ??? just cruising
Thinkin' 'bout these goons alive, but the truth is I ain't losin'
Ain't no time for you and I, so you better watch your movements

Mr. Unorthodox
Plus we got the weed on lock, couple C's gon' pop
? in the drop
We comin' through with some brand new drop
Dope phat, don't stop
This is serious knock
The workshop is so hot, honeys rockin' their pants
No tops, and we hit the whole flock
Next year, anticipate it like Pac
Y'all the laughing stock, with the strength of an ox
I locked down a couple blocks up top, and let my young gunners rock
Makin' sure your head bop
The same cat that took your watch, the same cat that went to war with Ed Cox
This is just another notch
Family, the bars rep for those who drink bourbon instead of scotch
Man, just give me my props
I'ma invest in the stocks
Plus turn back the hands of the clock



I got locked for moving crops all day
Circle blocks in a different drop all day
The fat not made them watch all day
And they still couldn't deal with me
And now I'm home, it's still hot all day
On the block where they toting Glocks all day
As long as the shots don't rock my way
Then they won't have to deal with me

Since the day of my birth
I was comin' up the worst, snatch the purse
Put my hand up her skirt, put the body in the earth
Then I thought what's it worth
Now forever, I'm cursed, I'm cursed
Bowin' down in the church
Tryna' pray to stay away from the hearse
And away from the nurse, make my rap thing burst
Man, this is for the fans, fans who slam dance like Fred Durst
Understand it's my turf
So put your boys in reverse, before I have to call ? to do work
Sittin' high on your perch
See, I came from the dirt
No name in the game, I'm the hurt
This is just another perk
It's for those puttin' out that street shit, come through with that jerk

B.L.A.C.K.,The Black Rob Report,2005,"B.L.A.C.K.R.O.B
I got a, freaky, freaky, freaky lil flow
Lock the town like Fidel Castro
Went straight to jail, did not pass go
(Aiyyo Black can we ask you a question?), no
Now back to live action, dust my shoulders off on this track, I'm just practicing
And I ain't even at my maximum, imagine if I was, this is for the love
Ladies and gentlemen, kids of all ages
You're about to go on a ride with the wild and outrageous
So buckle your seatbelts, my heat's felt
All in the ghetto, the dominator, Darth Vader creator
Officializing, signed and sealed, dot delivered
Minute, if he don't get no bigger
We never left, naw, we took a break off
You all tucked in? We about to take off

Now there's a rumor being spread about me and the team
And a couple wild brothers outta 115
Y'all might not have heard it, some cat got murdered
Now everybody walking around all shady nervous
I ain't sweatin that, bout to do a show in San Antonio
(Then what?), then fly back home
I calls guy on the phone, they had a car at the airport
Somethin with a chick chaffeur, butt naked in the full length fur
It's on and popping, work it baby ain't no stopping
Bad Boy is in the building, honeys catching feeling
Now we rated number one, now, sales through the ceiling
People had faith in Rob
I'm on that and run the point like Jason , god
It's one thing to be all hood
I guess its safe to say, (what?), so far so good
Black

Downtown we winding down, last call for alcohol
Scoop up your girl
You've never seen this before, that's a Bentely Four
Fresh out the store, this should be against the law
Party don't stop, can't stop, won't stop
Hit the bootlegger, pint of Rock
And I'm a get smart through the hollerin
Long as she doin less talkin and more swallowin
Now Black is what they hollerin out in the east
How he won't go away like permanent crease
And this is how I murder the streets
A lotta dudes is mad when I'm just trying to get a bite to eat
I dont care if yall just two-step to do the hustle
This is New York rapping, bring me some New York muscle
See me in the club, its nothin but love
Love the way I position myself to rise above

One more time baby",https://genius.com/Black-rob-black-lyrics
When You Come Home,The Black Rob Report,2005,"I remember that day clear, the month and the year
I was hustlin, '89 Downtown in Times Square
With ten niggas, but you recognized the Commander
You went to school and worked part time at Alexander 
Chain  and kiss on the cheeks
I said some slick shit like, 'we can do this on a beach'
You laughed, straight teeth, mines was all crooky
You walked away but kept turning back, laughin and lookin
I'm gassed, I said Pity she ain't want me to leave
Then she the one, I also waiting to see
Not called you, you called me we on the same tune
I'm Uptown me and June in the game room
I was glad to hear your voice, you choice
Brown sugar, 5'5'' a body was moist
And on top at all, personalities to match
Had a lot in common, yeah we still took it from scratch

From the streets, to the Pen, lovers and friends
I'mma hold you down, I'll be here when you come home
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you when you come home
From the streets, to the Pen, lovers and friends
I'mma hold you down, I'll be here when you come home
I'll be waiting for you (you know)
I'll be waiting for you when you come home

You was there when I signed with Diddy
You was there when  hit the city
There when I cried 
Your advice was like  from your titties
So , after a while I started flourishing
And just to think that you was sitting down
Having a couple of drinks, me and you on the 
I'm calling quits, cheatin, no matter how you call that shit
My stomach hurtin now, on the pit
And that's nonsense, you told you I was fuckin on tour
Not true, 
You know what, boo? I think I showed you too much feelings
I ain't believe when he said you fucked  from the building
It's cool-o, I let you kick me in my culo
I ain't coming back now matter how much you scream 
I spent a lot of dough on you, I put jewelery to goal on you
And that's how this all you gon do? Yo

From the streets, to the Pen, lovers and friends
I'mma hold you down, I'll be here when you come home
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you when you come home
From the streets, to the Pen, lovers and friends
I'mma hold you down, I'll be here when you come home
I'll be waiting for you (you know)
I'll be waiting for you when you come home

I admit now, time is hard
Fucked out, I was locked up, you 
We missed each other, guess it's so used to you
Everything about the shit that we used to do
It's spice you cookin, you give a nigga real good lovin and
That's why we still snap back, like a rubberband
Another man can't do what I do, I got you
I said the sky is blue and is blue
You fam, you know was better enough you fucked with Scram
Got you actin up for , smuggling grams
What you want, ma? Ha, the house or the car?
Yeah I know I'm locked down, but I'm still B.R
And love, before a minute there I thought you lost me
I got three and a halfin, happy home shortly
You probably thinkin I'm just poppin shit
Like some nigga get home and do 

From the streets, to the Pen, lovers and friends
I'mma hold you down, I'll be here when you come home

I'll be waiting for you (you know)
I'll be waiting for you when you come home

Ma, listen I gave you respect because you earned it
You still here fucking with me, could  you see?
Ma, soon as I touch I'm getting money soon
We gon do the engagement, then the Honeymoon
I'm feeling you, you coming or what?
What's crazy, me standing here spilling my guts
How dreams ain't gon turn to dust?
Long is all about me, you and the all outta us

From the streets, to the Pen, lovers and friends
I'mma hold you down, I'll be here when you come home

They Heard I Got Life,UnKnown,2005,"Didn't I tell you what I'm gonna do?
Here's where I'ma tell you what I'm gonna do
Lights and cameras...I hear that...We love it...Bad Boy bitch fire
I'm wild known in Miami
Puff and Nelly told me
You ain't gotta kill nothing to win no grammy
I keep a thing handy
In case a coward mistake me and think BR's a piece of candy
I used to play the block, moving butter
For that Calcutta, your pockets is Chris Rock
I make em stutter
Ice is pinky
Eyes is chinky
Ho's is kinky
Layin on that full length minky
The jail stank all on my name
It's a fucking shame
So I had to reassess my game and the whole aim
'Yo Black relax fam, show some reserve
You ain't a herb
Just a kid with gust and a lot of nerve'
I used to run up in backa you
Put the gat to you
Make you get on your knees and run your capital
I had the same dope ways of gettin paid
It was either that
Or risk my houses gettin raided
Ya'll about to witness the power of street knowledge
Fuck Long
Got my PHD from a street college
The rap game's real
So it's best you play behind the scenes
Like the ??mouse on the fifth wheel
But I can't do it
So what's the D-dot-E-Q it?
Fans rush me, it's all love ??
So when your dealing with dirt?
Play dirty
What I'ma do is come through in the blue 830
Fuck a quarter to eight
I'm on the corner of 8th
Boxin shorty with a quarter and eighth
Gotta make sure my daughter's straight
She got cake for school
And the bank accounts in good shape
Any dudes trying to get this cream?
Fam, one to the stomach
Bend em over like 6:15
Should have had my dog bite him sooner
Soon as I heard the rumor
He was trying to be Scarface junior
The confrontation short and sweet
Up north is weak
I bought the heat the whole court in the street
There the nigga go
Sipping Clicquot frontin
I'm low in the back
Hugged up with Miss Puerto Rico or somethin
????? been to Brazil with Lebanese
When he say don't move bitch you better freeze
Keep thinking your cute
We gonna turn this shit to Beirut
D? Holla at Absolute
Anytime its time to get dope call
Specially if it ain't nothin between me and duke
But sheetrock walls
If a nigga don't like me
He can lick my balls
I'm world famous for setting off ballroom brawls
I'm out west like 'Fuck the past'
You out west walking around with security up the ass
It ain't fair niggas
They call me Black Night Shamalyan:
Come through the village and I'ma scare niggas
You must don't love life
You fucking a thug's wife
Small timer, still living A Bug's Life
I'm doing 80 north I'm on the turnpike
Here light this up and tell us what that burn like
I don't believe y'all, fuck around and leave y'all
Duke a lame, why the fuck you let him breath for?
It won't stop until your teams ???
This the info, I gotta come and knock y'all senseless
Aaanybody over 25 fronted
At the end I drunk the milk like the Indy 500
It's Black-O the mack-O
Ma, you comin?
You see me
I ain't frontin and my ice is stunnin
'05, yo it must be the season for duck huntin
When I leave here tonight B I'ma fuck somethin
It's mandatory that I get in some ass
And shine on these faggots like I did in the past
You sleep?  Then I'm hittin the stash
Fam, I'm at war
That's why I watch reruns of M.A.S.H
Dudes scheme to hit up my physical
And each one said its just hate
Mufuckas is miserable
So when you come attack my brothers
Watch out: that heat
Make niggas dance like Scatman Caruthers
Ya'll punks paid the ultimate price, I'm not nice
My fourth felony, Ya'll heard that I got life

No Fear,"Game Tested, Streets Approved",2011,"Everybody talk, nobody gon' do it
Came through, defied the odds, then I grew here
I must have made 10 mill and ran through it
Baby love come and go man, so screw it
It's nothing to it
Watch me as I stick and move on this groove
While I'm duckin' the paparazzi
Only person shot me was Jonathan Manion
Before and after I was fat as Ralph Cramden
Y'all don't like the fam then shout it
Dumb, dumb, dumb, I don't like Black Rob
Let's talk about it
These motherfuckers change like the seasons
The hate that y'all harbor, 9 times outta 10 there's no reason
Committing treason, then they try to run
Forget that they got asthma, stop and they start wheezing
I see him looking for his asthma pump
I'm in that Maybach watching the ? on the plasma slumped
I'm right here daddy, I no fear
Objects in the mirror is closer than they appear
So people be advised, my eyes on the prize
This ain't an exercise or the birth of some tough guys
A lot of y'all don't figure me rich
Won't follow me around, just twitter me, bitch
And I show you how I done it, pulled out and told 'em run it
Plus I'll let you meet the fam uptown in the wild 100s
Fans wanna walk in my shoes, I give 'em a chance
My lifestyle'll make 'em defecate in their pants
Y'all don't believe me, ask the God 'bout me
He'll tell you how I hate to lose and I can't stand defeat
A product of da streets, P-O-D-S
I don't like cheques, fam, C-O-D's best
That's how I do when I do it, I'm not stressed
These chicks see me stuntin' like boy is a hot mess
I must confess, Harlem made me this way
Fuck what the chicks say, Rob don't play
So people throw your hands up and show me where the cash at
Matter fact, put 'em down, I might catch a flashback
Benz hatchback, TVs in it
Haters like ""that's my car"" till they see me in it
Head reason I go on and all my thoughts' infinite
Furthermore, y'all ain't heard the bars flow in a minute
See Rob can hold his own, ain't nothing timid
He don't sound like y'all, it's all authentic
Gimme the ball on the court, I put all the ?
Just cause I do and-1 moves, its no gimmick nigga
You're spitting limericks, your petty five lines
Wanna see the beast come out, say my name five times

Round for round, I'm down, shake the town
Shake you down, wave the pound, lays it down
P! Haha, listen, listen
Yo, the 4-5th is what I use to spark
For entertainment purpose, no amusement park
Listen pa, duke my movement's smart
Chest blow with a left throw nigga
It'll bruise your heart
Listen pa, I am not kiddin', plot thicken
Shots given to niggas who fuckin' wit' Ahk ?
Rap's my profession, the biz is reefer
I smoke more of that shit than Wiz Khalifa
1-2-6 and Madison got body bags
My gun spit shit, leave your ass in a body bag
Brooklyn's Finest, fuck police
Your wife's a cop then fuck police
Listen, nigga my thing gon' pop

With bank gon' pop, P!",https://genius.com/Black-rob-no-fear-lyrics

Holler at dollar is holler at money
Come on Sunny you brought your girl
Walk into the club look dummy
Everybody .. at you look funny
Checking out shorty with an ice on her tummy
My shit bring… she got a whole … I don’t see how
Duch bring wife with a rule tonight
This boy is lied down is eh doing this right
Big talks bottles attract top models
Never bring your chick to the club .. model
I don’t need wify at the crib I got her
All up in the VIP like I just hit the lotto

Got a new bubby in the house we got one
Chicks so – they want me to bring sweet

Got off to the sunset
All I am trying to say is leave bubby at home
Don’t tell her where are you going
Turn off your phone glad six feet doctors won’t check up
.. have a good time get of my blessing
Is not fare .. breathing with no air
They want to kick it too even if they don’t see it through
Ask them something they look at you like it’s three of you
You look like what you want me to do
Bringing up the names all a hundred in a random
It’s all a game I don’t bring sand to the beach
And chicks feel the same I know the shit
But I ain’t saying no names with you busy at the bar making it rain

Since I came home from the swing
I want the money y’all can have the bling bling
Cause diamonds don’t define me and none of y’all design me
Look behind me, phantoms and …
Man I’m used to grinding for chatter, you hate me, whatever

Something like Oklahoma Dakota, they on that next shit
They rolling out the black carpet for me
Get out the Maybach and let somebody park it for me

It’s the money that we touch, we stack it and pile up
You stack it and pile up more, get involved
