Thug Holiday,Thug Holiday,2002.0,"Thug holiday, go ahead you can cry this up right baby
Everything gone be gravy later, that's right
This the time when we take time to remember
All the loved ones we lost in the struggle you know
I dedicate this to my brother Hollywood, Toby, Bam
My dog Itchy and Lil Trav, I dedicate this to the struggle
Everybody in the county jail, state penn, check it out

If it wasn't for bad luck, hell I guess that a nigga wouldn't have none
But when I think about it, what would I be without my gun
How could I, get away from the po-po's, if a, nigga couldn't run
And how was I given a daughter when I always prayed for a son
Life is crazy ain't it, sometimes I even think the same thing
I've been waiting on freeing the ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, Taterhead done lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love
So I pray for the better days, face the bomb had a run-a-ways
And, I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays, it's crazy ain't it

Just like the soldiers, that ain't coming home this year
Just like the fellas, in prison, we miss you so much for real
What about the children, who ran away, that ain't coming home today
Well here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most a thug holiday
Just like 'em, just like 'em, just like 'em, a thug holiday - 2x

Here go one for, all these killings and all these conflicts in religion
See the Muslims, Jews and Christians but know they are all God's children
There's only, one him, plus ain't none of y'all confronting him
So blind in our own minds we wouldn't even know God if we was in front of him
And, I read your books know all your remixes to the bible
What about a, verse for the thugs curled with drugs and survival
That's asking chapels naming Martin, Malcolm and Farrakhan
In all my history books, only one died was the Americans
And, that's point of my, who's responsible for Vietnam
And, hold on there's more, we had two World Wars
And, how come the judges make more than the teachers is making
When they the ones raising all the taxes and got us fighting for education
Life is crazy ain't it

So many tears, through out the years
Somebody tell me what's going on
And so many liiives, but only God knows
About the pain deep inside
It gets so hard, you got to keep your head up
I know you're fed up, but stay strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, thug holiday
Just like 'em, just like 'em, just like 'em, a thug holiday - 2x

This is for my people in the ghetto
I'm calling out, calling out
To all my thugs in the ghetto
Calling out, calling out
It gets hard sometimes, but you
Got to keep your head up, and be strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, a thug holiday

They say tell the truth, Shane and them (uh-huh)
Thank God for the thugs too...

Drop the top and let the sunshine in

Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Hen'
It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind
With the 'dro in the wind

I'm a ol' sneaky, ol' freaky, ol' geechy-ass nigga
Collard green, neckbone-eatin-ass nigga
Always wearin my jeans baggy saggy
You know Florida, Georgia, South Cakalaky
Growed up eatin spam sandwiches
Sugar water and mayonnaise sandwich
Share the room with bout four mo' brothers
But wasn't no mo' room and wattn't no mo' covers
A little bad motherfucker (ah-ha)
Always rude and always in trouble
None of my teachers ain't like me (uh-huh)
But make it so bad, Pearl had seven mo' like me
If you growed up the way I did
You gotsta understand, Trick love the kids

Ya don't like how I'm livin? Bitch fuck you (uh-huh)
That's right I'm a rude-ass nigga
Quick to do you, cut a fool-ass nigga
Weighin' in at bout a buck six-five
And a nigga can fuck, plus the boy gets live (that's right)
You know legs, wings, and short thighs (short thighs)
Eat 'em up, beat 'em up, then switch sides

Hot whore work her Sean John velour to the floor
He oughta enjoy, with the loaded four-four
Be sure and acquire more 'fore ya fuck with mine
Disrespect; I'll disconnect ya line
With a sick SWAT, when shit's hot, ya get shot
The fire, the fury, ya fuck with it not
Ya stoppin the grace, get out my space and my - face
Fore me and my ace-a lay down the whole place
Recognize, this is the verbalize
Surprise, fuckin with me wrong way to wise nigga
Hoes, clothes, shows, Vogues, golds
Big ol' bankrolls, that's all a nigga know
Throw yo' elbows, I'm sicker than I suppose
Hoes unchose, cuz my jewelry froze
You know how it goes, these young niggas don't want it like this
Go off and get yo' gat, to silence the chit-chat, blast!
So pass, outlast, bout cash
Mo' sicky, talk tricky to the trick like trash
Lo realer, a go-rilla, flow for mo' scrilla
Come clean, lookin mean, but you ain't no killa!

It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind
With the 'dro in the wind

Look now beyond the rims and all the 'dro
The 'dro and all the smoke, my throat, it makes me choke
Like a serial killer was squeezin on my throat box
In the clutches of danger but not a stranger on the block
Is it the cheeferry reefer be blowin my chest up
Be riding from the club trying my best not to mess up
A professor of this lyrical thang, I'll take the purist strain
Of this slang and inject it into your veins
Did your heart stop man? Drop-top fade
Aviator shades with a mirror front face
Movin through the dirty at a slow pimps pace
Kinda like the turtle and the rabbit in the race
To the finish line, I jumped a pair of Reeboks
So bright, so fresh, snow white but no socks
Then I slip on some of that O with the wings
I bust it straight out the pack like a three piece
Prophylactic, before you splack it
You gotta prepare it and mack it, wear your jacket or it's tragic
Not intended for any illegal purposes
It's like anthrax and small pox in surplus to murderous
(Ya gotsta understand Trick love the kids!)

Tonight,Back By Thug Demand,2006.0,"You lookin' real good baby
I just want you to know
I had a wonderful time this evening
But unfortunately
I guess this part of the story
Well we tell eachother goodnight
Nah how about this
How about I break all the rules
And tell you what I really been thinkin'

Girl you got the big ol ass, and bow legs
And fine hair
And all the shit that I want
Sexy motherfucker
You acting like you want it right now
Let a nigga know
Is we gun fuck tonight
My dick is gettin' rock hard
Oh my god
There's gonna be some fuckin' tonight
Take your panties off
Move your panties off to the side
And let a nigga know
Is we gun fuck tonight

See good pussy
Will bring the freak out ya
But if you eat it and don't get cheated
The first off I beat the breaks off her
No sense in half-steppin'
Get serious
Get the titties suckin' like
Clit rubbin' and ass grabbin'
I eat that pussy ass backwards
A few strokes of this long warm tongue
Should make the pussy cum
So much for round one
I spend a whole round two and back again
Stick in move
Stick in move


I need a real man
I'm sick of playin' with lil' boys
I'm tryin' to explore more like hot oils and sex toys
I can't keep fakin'
Man I'm so backed up and
I can't eat I can't sleep
My knees weak makin' me keep shakin'
I need a real nigga to come save me
One who pamper me and bathe me
And make me wanna swallow his baby
Talkin' thug shit like fuck me crazy
From the back or in the butt
I'm like fuck me baby fuck me baby


All the matter is
I can get you wet again
Suck you fuck you better than
Any other nigga can
I specialize in multi orgasms
Gettin' rid of back spasms
And do it all without viagra
I'll fuck you all night
Make you sleep all day
Treat you to beakfast then
Eat you for breakfast
I know baby
I'm so unselfish
But you're lovin' it besides
I'm a freak so I can't help it
All I need is old slow songs
One cold shot of patron
See you walkin' around me in a thong
And it'll be over before the chorus come back on
You'll be leavin and I'll be ab libin'
And we'll be singin' our damn song
It's like the first time we made eachother cum
We'll be suckin' and fuck eachother
Taste eachother cum
No soul alive can erase what we done

Sugar (Gimme Some),Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets,2004.0," Uh huh
 Yeah
 Aw man I got a sweet tooth, can you dig it
 After this one you gon need a root canal then
 I love sugar all of it
 This one for all the clean, decent women
 Lay it on me girl
 Pay Close Attention

She put that sugar on my tongue
Shes gonna
Gimme gimme some
She put it right there on my tongue (Sweet Sweet)
Right there on my tongue (She turns me on, like no other)

And gimme some of your butter pecan
Put it right there on tip of my tongue, hold it
Right jeeeah
Cuz baby, if I bite you
I bet you'll like it
French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me
With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream
The best things are the wet dreams
And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene
Orally, I speak the truth
Cuz the blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Cuz, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches
When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin'
Southern boys we crave for old slice of pie after they main course
So if you game for it
I came for it
I got a thing for ya
That I can't ignore
 - 2X

She put that sugar on my tongue, tongue
Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum
Goodie goodie gum drop
Put me in a tongue lock
Did it till my body went numb, numb
Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weave
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
Cuz she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night
So put the bubbles in the tub and Luda-christen me
 - 2X
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeeeah Yeeeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
Cuz I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

I Cry,Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets,2004.0,"Our father who art in heaven
Thank you Lord
Lord thank you Lord

That's right
Y'all could stand up and rejoice now
We about halfway through the road
We got about another hundred years to go
Thats for sure
God is good thats right God is good
In fact God is not good sometimes
He's good all the time

No matter how hard I cry
It just don't seem loud enough
Lord I hope you're hearing me
This goes out to the lonely streets
And all my brothers sick of crying yall

I got a letter from my nigga in prison
He said he shooked them and its
Too far to drive don't even worry about a visit
All he needed was a couple pictures
And a few dollars
That way he ain't have to worry about borrying
From a nigga
Told me to check on his old girl
Make sure its all good
For her and the kids
But hell I already did
And then he asked me about his shorty
I hate he asked me about his shorty
Cause its been some years since I saw him
Him not knowing his baby's momma's horror
And ever since the days he's been gone
She's kinda trapped in a storm
But he goes on and on about when he gets home
And then he mention every nigga that did him wrong
Put him right back where he started at
But he ain't snitched
So he feels them that niggas in his click
They ought to pay for that
He did his time day for day without turning snake
Cause real OG's don't even take pleas


See when I pray I pray for everybody
I pray that God bless America
That way these terrorist can't tear us up
But I'm sick and tired of a lot of other things
And the bottom line is
We gotta set examples for the kids
We first ought to teach em love
Cause these days us niggas got
Too much hatred installed in us
The radio and TV they just can't get enough
This great big old world
I guess it still just ain't big enough
But y'all listen cuz I'm holding on playa
The Lord ain't brought me that far
Just to drop me off here
Y'all keep arguing about religions
While y'all referring to y'all old books of the bible
Y'all all out to miss the last bus to heaven
See everybody gonna wait
Ain't gonna do be no fighting, no pushing, no cussing
Nope not at the gate
Cause everybody gonna meet there
Niggas you ain't even like in your first life
They gonna walk by you and speak
So


No matter no matter no matter
How hard I cry how hard I cry
Oh no matter how hard I cry
Ooh Yea

Even and 'Pac and Biggie become the best of buddies
Invest some money stay together in heaven
I know them niggas gonna have so much gangsta shit to tell me
And its gonna feel so good seeing them together
So I'm sending my deepest condolences
To those who lost family members
To the hands of the men that befriend us
Y'all remember we all in this together
But whosever ain't forgiving
Y'all gonna have hell getting in heaven",https://genius.com/Trick-daddy-i-cry-lyrics

And then
You'll understand
A lil' better then

And you be
Startin' shit
And ever since you made president
We ain't even seen you since
You need to (You need to)
Fill our schools
Rebuild our church and homes
Stop killin' my own kind
And leave my Earth alone
And stop tappin' my phone
And searchin' my bro
And keep your personal feelings home
When you bandin' my chrome

Weak and the strong

Back in the Days,www.thug.com,1998.0,"Back in the days
It wasn't no AIDS
It wasn't no AK's
More afros than braids
Wasn't nuttin for a boy to get a straight fade
But not no mo
Niggas done twist up the fro
Let it lock and grow
Quick to go to gunplay bout that flow
Nigga you don't know?
And I'm thinkin bout when
Round the time i was ten
And way before the pen
The worst thing i ever remember seeing
Was a boy get his whole head bashed in
But now they gettin blown off
Whole chest torn off
Whole block roped off
Two clips in his house for fuckin round
Runnin off at his damn mouth
Yep back in the days it wadn't bout fame
And it wudn't bout a name
Plus it wudn't no thang
To kill a nigga and do the rest of ya life in the chain gang
But na shit done changed
And I know it seem strange
But I'm a maintain
So I'm a stack my flow and say ""fuck you hoes""
Stay the fuck out the chain gang
Hook
Some hoes no shame
Other hoes play games
See they'll fuck ya for the fame
And when the heat is on and they can't hang
Theyll give them crackers yo name
Thell say it under oath
And swear to tell the truth
Run down what ya do
How ya clown wit ya crew
Along with that a list of shit like who fucked in who house
Tell a ho about ya spot
Where ya threw away the Glock
Bout every bitch that ya shot
Every key that ya caught
And every car that ya drop
The ninety-seven drop tops
And them Carolina trips
And then they grill you the flip
Time and date when ya dip
Every deal you done dealt
And every crib you done built
With no muthafuckin guilt
Back in tha days
It wudn't none a this
Ya couldn't pay a bitch to snitch
It just goes to show that
Fuck niggas and slimy hoes make the world flip the script
Hook
See back in the days
All pimps got paid
And all hoes got slayed
Alot a money got saved
And every playa had it made
In Dade
We was slayed before then
Boys was made before then
Way before them
Raisin poor men
With no choice
Way before them
But na shit done changed
I mean a nigga done came
Ya done took our name
We done peeped yall game
Ya ovalooked our pain
Man, and we ain't tryin to be friends
Ya wudn't tryin back then
Had a problem with my skin
Got together with ya clan
And send a young poor black man
Straight to the pen
Ya had beef with the blacks
But na the blacks got the gats
So if a cracker talk slick his ass gon get whacked
And you can bet that
See nigga
Back in the days
I was young and afraid
So dumb in a way
I was trapped in a maze

Ho But You Can’t Help It,Based on a True Story,1997.0,"I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it
Cause being raised by a ho is kinda hectic
Old material bitch
Gold-digging for them tender dicks
A real nigga never give you shit Biotch
Born and raised in the motherfucking projects ho
Getting money by at the pak Jam, by the back door
Wearing them shorts up your ass with a tube top
Letting niggas stick they fingers all in the cock
Pussy all big and wet, looking good and shit
Smelling like dead fish
And every week it's the same shit you and that lil shit
And every time I see you, you got to have dick
You wants mo' respect
You gets no respect
And all you want is some hardcore sex
1, 2, 3, yes you know
4, 5, 6, 7 niggas in your hole
Back-to-back from the back, head and all
Doo-doo brown and licked his hairy ass balls
In the streets late-night me, you, and all my boys
What I'm thinking 'bout honey bun (honey bun)
You got the nigga running up in you
Shake it like ""Naww, I'm not trying to do you""
No good freak, is the same but I love you
I'm off in you skin-deep motherfucker let's do it again sometimes you like that, huh?
The next nut going out for your grandma

You'se a ho but you can't help it cause you don't know it
I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it, cause you don't know it
Oh, Oh, Ho
You'se a ho but you can't help it, cause you don't know it

Stupid bitch you done dropped out of high school
But who's the fool?
You'se a prime example
You met a nigga named Mike
At the nice Lexus lane looking like grands for the night
Times are hard, you scared, your rent is due
It ain't no limit to the shit you do
You making records in the studio
Telling me it ain't who you know it's who you blow
Sheit
I'll hit you up for a gangbang
Have you doing strange thangs for some small change
Keeping it real
Fucking with the wrong pops
Longshoreman on the dock
Head, booty and cock
You get what he got
Shooting tech to his whole cat
Took him home let him hit you from the back
With tax because it's like that

I figure you'se a Ho Ho Ho

You can't trust
A bitch with a big butt
You get the guts, then tell that ho to keep in touch
Jimmy-up when I bust her
Fucked her
HIV can't trust her
I got too much to lose
Cash rules
Protect the family jewels
Yeah
And I ain't going out like Easy
Believe me
A nigga disease free

You'se a ho but you can't help it cause you don't know it
I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it, cause you don't know it
Oh, Oh, Ho
You'se a ho but you can't help it, cause you don't know it

Had another baby, blame it on the same nigga
Reason being is seeing that he's a dope dealin
Bitch, you'se a fiend you want dick
You wan't much flow
But I can't pay you ho
You dissed Trick
And now you on the hitlist
I dogged you out, and now you getting dick shit
I told my boys
That you make much noise
And you like getting off with those sex toys
A bunch of high school hoes at the Goom-Bay*
They got they drawers in they hands like it's okay
They got all the niggas jockin cause they cock fat
The young hoes turning heads cause they got back
Now, they finer than them hoes off TV
But, they fucking every nigga on fifteenth
So I figgaaaaaaa
You'se a Ho Ho Ho

You'se a ho but you can't help it cause you don't know it
I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it, cause you don't know it
Oh, Oh, Ho
You'se a ho but you can't help it, cause you don't know it

I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no

Wake up, new day, same shit
Get dressed, gotta pay my rent
Little off for the money I spent
Next week 'til I get my check
And I don't even wanna work at this job
Matter fact I've been workin' too hard
Let's say I quit today
Come back, go postal tomorr'
This time I'ma take shit too far
I don't give a fuck who you are
When you broke they do you so wrong
When you blow they knew you was raw
Two strikes so you can't sell coke
Two kids so we can't stay broke
But the street life all we know
So you know one thing? I can't say no

I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no
I can't say no

If it wasn't for the fact that I so happened to be rappin'
I'd prolly be jackin', prolly be trappin'
Somewhere traffickin' packages
Takin' this shit back to the bases
But that's the past and I'm tryin' to erase this
But how the hell am I s'posed to live
When the government want half on every mil'?
The cost of gas still climbin' rapidly
And I pay the city, the county, state
And mothafuckas still out there tryna tax me
I gotta sell more ringtones
I gotta cut back and stop usin' my juke phones
Cause at the rate I'm goin'
I'm bound to lose my home off the interest rate alone

I can't say no
(I can't say no, I can't say no)
I can't say no
(I can't say no, no)
I can't say no
(I can't say no)
I can't say no

How can I say no?
How can I say no after all this time?
If it wasn't for the ghetto, where would I be?
If it wasn't for those food stamps and welfare checks mama used to give me
Where would I be?
If it wasn't for the hood, if it wasn't for the addicts
If it wasn't for the fact that they was on drugs
That they didn't know enough not to get on drugs
Shit wasn't for the struggle
Wasn't for bad luck

Minor things for the small change

She loved how
I did wrong for so long

Somebody tried to take my dogs life
Atempted homicide
They outside and ain't gon let em ride
Dont wanna talk

My name is Richard Nixon but they screaming Deuce Pop
With the one stop shop
Heroin, weed, and rocks
I feed the block
And ride the strio in a tinted drop
And I even met the niggas who invented rocks
I got the block game from the county of Dade
A bounty hunter won't rest till my bounty is paid
We got 200 hundred bricks coming from the direct link

Cum all over my shit for me, and make a spit for me bitch
See I don't need 'cha, I don't see ya'

And then something for your mama too
Thinkin bout cha all day, in a thug way
Wanna hold you in my arms til tomorrow, and I can't wait
Tongue tied, bitch ain't lie
Showin love to the lil guy
And you know, I'm showin love to the lil guy
Suckin fuckin touchin one another, on top of the covers
Let's get some air off in this motherfucker *breathing*
And she be, callin my name I'm telling her thangs
I can't explain, so forever we should always be together shit
Sweet love, slow tongue kisses and hugs
I'm on a mission, wishin kissin that belly button
She hum a song, as the come along
And it won't be long, 'fore she reach that zone
Move along, (however long)
To each his own, prescious stones, when you reach that zone
Keep a peaceful home, and leave them crooked bitch alone
Make your kids and your wife your whole life
It'll be hard at first but hold tight, when in love

Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)
Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)
Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)
Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)

Could it be - I'm lost in myself
Caught up in myself, trynta keep it real
But all the wil'in is costin myself
Could it be I'm scared to love
Y'all want a turn to get so scandalous
And this thug nigga just can't handle this

But then I - never met a girl that could roll a Philly like you
Use a skillet like you, when I kick my flow who feel it like you
You was lookin all sexy when you got out yo' ride
Checkin out yo' thigh, the dreams of a fine girl I see out my eyes
She about your size little mama
Don't really seem like the type that'll bring a motherfucker drama
Some nigga done just put up with a little trauma, so it's me she seem to honor
These other hoes done been short lately, me and her been hangin
Smokin, drankin, keep her shit tight swangin
All in a midnight bangin
Never trippin but I'm tippin or just kickin it wit my dogs, we ball
But them niggas tellin me my nose been open ever since I hit them drawers
I tell em ""I'm still a pimp"" I don't really want cha but I just pretend
Cuz I'm down to kick it wit you the same way that I be trippin out wit them
Trick Daddy won't ride on me, he told me ""Twista...
Go head and kick it however you want just handle your business mister""
So I sit back and say ""Fuck it"" pick up the phone and call my bitch up
Steady thinkin: is it all in the bud or I am fallin in love?
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 
Fallin in love. 

Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)
Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)
Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?
(Am I falling in love, oh nooo)
Could it be that I'm lost gettin' soft
Or just fallin' in love?

A real woman scholar

No more sad songs for long, girl you daddy's home
I'll be your player
I need a player in my life tonight
Somebody that'll treat me right
And just, hold me tight all through the night
I want a player in my life
Yeah, you can play your sex games
Kinky things but still maintain
I'm running game while you giggle off my ghetto slang
I want the best for you
First, nobody stressing you
A good girl, therefore God's been blessing you
So go with your first mind
Get it right the first time
Hang tight, 'cause early on be your worst time
You got me wanting you bad so I been watching you
And while they calling me dad, I'm simply jocking you
Clocking you
Watching the threads in your dazzy dukes
Hawking you
Watching you move in your ?baka? suit
Your body too
You'll go get it, therefore you bout it boo
5'3"", and I can see what you got for me
Show me some love
Kisses and hugs
Bubble baths in hottubs
Plus baby oil back rubs
You got me heated up
Slow it down, then we can speed it up
Plus, you bringing out the freakinus
Free your mind
Let me and you spend some time
I'm on that sixty and I'm headed for that nasty nine

And you can shift into the ride with me
And glide with me
High to the sky with me
Right here on the side of me
I'll be your player
Chorus
*call me X-rated*
I'll eat your coochie with your legs up
Down your back, up your crack, then I'll blow all in your butt
I'll suck your ass where your drawers crawl
Suck them titties and all
And make you climb the wall
You taste so sweet (ahh)
From your head to your feet
It's my treat
So baby girl just let me eat
And call me freaky deaky 'cause I want to be your servant
And while I'm servin
I'll slap you up with syrup and butter
Average niggas wouldn't do the things I do
I'm on my knees so please just let me taste you
Shit, my mind's in the gutter
I'm eatin your butter
Pink eggs and ham

And if you never been down South before
We bout to show y'al how we ridin' (Get up, get up)
(Let's...let's go)

Be like down South show a lil' change
For the girls in the club that be shakin' that thang
And got the young players comin' up, wanna run thangs
Y'all see them girls when they in them g-strangs
Now everybody wanna be down wit da South
(Now everybody wanna be down wit da South)
Now everybody tryin' to get down wit da South

Cause in the club (In the club)
All them girls that be shakin' in the club
In da club (In the club)
All the thugs they be playin' in the club (Ooooh)

Yo, I'm from the state where the sun shine
Where the women are pretty and they so fine
Where the dudes are rude but they so cool
Listen good weather is better for a good fella
And every ride will probably be on twenty-two's or twenty-four's on T-0's
And you know like I know, we gon' represent it everywhere we go
And every time we drop hits
For hittin' everything we spit it gots to be the shit
So give me a fresh white tee
A pair of Preist jeans and some j's yall never seen
An I can't help but win on heavy rotation
On all of your stations
Down South takin' over all of the charts
We just got started and will not stop


You ain't never seen a big ol' ass like this
And you ain't never gon' run across a badder bitch
I'm Ms. Trina, Miami's finest
And you can ask your man who has the flyest
Players who millionaires try to buy this
And I ain't got shit to hide
I like to squat and ride
Go front and back, side to side
Bend me over show me what you holdin'
And oh shit, now give it to me, give me that big ol' dick
First suck me up, and then buck me up
Go deeper, deeper, beat me, beat me
Let's make a sequel for the naked people
Your whole click against my click
Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad


Here we come to fuck the whole floor
Ying Yang Twins kickin' in your door
Scat like a rat when a cat comin' out the house
Dirty South

Y bad, we done did it again
Trick Daddy and the Ying Yang Twins
If you don't know, Let me fill you in
I hope you know we in it to win
You didn't know we the super friends
We done did another song again
So I just know it's on again
We gonna put a joint to win
Y'all gonna get rolled over like a bulldozer
I hope you know the game over
Dade County the fullest county
We still run these got damn streets
I don't think I'ma change
In ten years I'ma be doin' the same damn thang

Nigga fuck hoes
Nigga do shows
Nigga get in trouble, uh oh
Will I smoke if it ain't dro
Hell no player so fuck no


Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Now shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Now shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad
Shake that ass and make your baby daddy mad

The Children’s Song,Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets,2004.0,"Children hold on, to your dreams
Believe in love, let love be the light
To show the wayyyyy
And love will shine on you one day

Hold on, to your dreams at least
And believe in love
It'll show you the way, it'll show you the way
That's right, uh-huh

God bless the souls of those that impose a threat
Better yet, let's forget 'bout this foolishness
And though I never asked for forgiveness
If you wanna pray to him, here's some things I might say to him
Lord thank you for my wife, my father and mom
And God thank you for my daughter and son
You know the devil he's been doin us wrong
And I love both of my kids, but they momma can't raise 'em alone
And yo, I just want a better understandin
There's got to be another way to handle it
And well we got to be mature about it
We both made our mistakes, and can't no one get us out it
My little girl's a little lady
And though she often act crazy, she still my baby
And I anticipate the day that I can see
The smile on her face when she speak to Little J


Hold on, to your dreams, you gotta believe
Believe in love - that's right
Believe in love and the Lord
It'll show you the way okay, it'll show you the way, just lead
Shine your heart on it

You see the problem with the world is
That there's way too many faces and way too many races
They done even managed to modernize slavery
They clonin little babies, these people goin crazy
And white America's on high alert
Black America's still starvin and livin in public housin
You still eatin off your food stamps
That's why one out of every three black boys end up in boot camp
And not to mention the ones we'll be missin
Let's face it, e'rybody can't make it
And e'rybody wanna escape it (no way)
But if it's thug life we live, then thug life it is
But just remember, somethin gotta give
That's why, so many and die and, so little live
I can't explain it, but that's how it is
And God forbid, but it is what it is


Hold on, to your dreams, and believe in 'em
Feel the strength, I know
He'll show you the way, he'll show you the way
He'll show you the way

The Lord have mercy on 'em
For they young and dumb, and that's why I come to pray for 'em
Though some of us are better than most of us
You can't involve the kids with our differences
And since memories are all we have
Don't you agree that all little kids deserve to laugh?
I'm, teachin the facts about our black leaders
Cause they be strong people, just keep readin, it gets deeper
We're all God's people
So regardless of color and race, we all is covered in grace
And you gotta be stronger than most
Therefore, we only supposed to go when we chosen
Cause God for the thugs too
Just be sincere at heart and dawg, God'll still love you
So to all my fallen soldiers, the struggle's over
All in the name of Jehovah


Hold on, to your dreams, c'mon, y'know
Believe in love, and love be the light
I know, you know, that's right - he'll show you the way
I know, it'll shine on you, c'mon
And just pray with me, sing with me, c'mon
Sing with me, c'mon
Believe in love - he'll show you the way
I know you will - he'll show you the way, okay?
Just believe and pray

Lord knows I ain't livin right
Yall know I ain't chilling right
Smokin out everyday and night
Gotta ease my mind
Gotta find time to rewind
Cause I'm falling way behind
Me and my dogs be on the grind
Gotta watch my back
Represent for the soldierz
Die couple years older
Have boulders, a lil soda
Get rich with a motive
Now shit done changed
Niggas gunning in the rain
On straight cocaine
And it ain't no thang
Since the game in his arm
Straight aim at his arm
Gotta watch my back
Gotta stack my flow
Gotta pay my bills
Leave bread in the will
All to the old girl
See yall hoes betta chill
Now back to the game
Lots of niggas done died for this
Done lost they lives to this
Got me on this survival some type of AK rider shit
Now It started with thug
A thug with a heart
Took a trip with some hard
Had to do it he was scared
See his mama in the park
Tears dried up
Mom what's wrong (what's wrong)
Your son's gone
Is he ever coming back home
She said you straight young nigga
Take a look in tha mirror
I was there when you was gone
Now back to the streets
Where young niggas like me
Gon do what we got to do
You ain't nuttin without ya crew
But ah light in tha night and I'm thinking bout you
In the bedroom tied up
With ya mouthpiece wired up
With a safe in the floor
And that yayo then had muthafuckaz fired up
An see that's the truth
I done told my nigga this street shit ain't a game
But it seem the same
Young nigga get slain
For a lil bit a fame and cocaine
Try to do thangs
Just for the benzs and beamers and bitches
Thinkin riches gon take care snitches
And niggas wit triggaz
Niggas betta watch they back
Cuz the same time I'm trying to speak to you and release to you
Some shit ya need
Young nigga wit greed gonna try to put the heat to you
Heat to you

They call it a jack
In the donk with the gat
Ski mask and a vest
Let his heart do the rest
Thuggin, broke niggas be the best
Yes, and gon die if ya buck
Get fucked right up
Come back if ya like
Bring ya gat if ya like
And get splacked if ya like
On ya back if ya like
All I needed was a chance
A MAC-10 and a benz
So I can clown with my friends
Show the world I'm a man
Then break​ my dawgz out the pen
When I'm off in the club
Much love for the thugs
See Hennessy in the clubs
Got all these rabid ass, maggot hoes
They warm it up
 - 2X
Now bout dem hoes
Try to find them a man
That can pay they bills
And yes they can
Weight 28 grams
Take a tour of the land
Ain't got no plan
They'll wait for a thug
Go give em a hug
Show em how to be loved
Then suck em up
Straight fuckin em up
Then get in his benz
Get with all his friends
Take all his ends
Then send him to the pen
Then do it all again
Amen
But lord forgive em
Have mercy on they're souls
For livin like hoes
And say a lil prayer for me and my life

All my shit paid for
And why should I rent a house
When I can huy it and write it off
Make it my Florida home for the summer
Round winter time just rent it out
See I ain't none of them
Who ride around on rented rims
Change on the weekend
And floss in him mama's Benz
See when I hit the scene
I be so fresh so clean
White fitted, white tee
Ain't nan nigga like me
What kind of shit you on
Wearin' fuckin' rhinestones
Them cubic zirconia son
Them ain't fuckin' diamonds
So you gonna fuck around
And get gangrene at the arm
Who'd rob and kill one
Over some mother-fuckin' slum

That shit for gazey
And it ain't real
Unless its copper or stainless steel
So whoever made it...
You shouldn't have paid it
Twenty grand for a watch
Thats fuckin' gold plated!

17 gold mouth
18 on the block
Nigga got them thangs out
Birdman stunna, nigga we don't sit in jail
Real nigga's do real thangs
You know we make bail
Trick hit me on the cell
Know I gotta make a sale
Found myself in Dane County
Nigga's movin' pounds of bail
So fresh,so bright with the ice
Nigga you could loose your life playing with the bright lights! Yea
Khaled got my back
I'm strapped nigga in Prive
Doin' it big, poppin' bottles, nigga the g-way
Black handles, black ice, we'll get it right
For a cheap price nigga that cutter'll get your mind right
M.O.B. to a bitch
Made my hood rich
Quick cash, young money, it's that uptown shit
Ballin'one them bitches
Shock callin' on them bitches
Two million on some ice and some cars on them bitches


They asked the kid the difference between mine and his
See my shit blindin'
His shit don't shine
Cause that shit ain't real
His gemstones, they fruity pebbles
Just like Flinstones
And he had his ""Roley"" on
But I ain't even notice his arm
But his diamonds cloudy
And he ain't shiny
And I heard his shit ""Tick Tick Tickin'""
Oh man, this nigga* trippin!
See we poppin' bottles and smokin bugga
Actin' cocky
Big thangs with fat pockets
Wearing seventy-thousand dollar watches
My overseas friends
Are breakin' thangs in
Invest in a smaller hit town
Shakin', bakin'and breakin' it down
We gettin' top dollar
Cause we got that top powder
Hoes slob on our johnson
Cause johnson got that best powder
We call a grand a dollar

If it wouldn't for thug holiday (ahh man)

In this life I live, I done see niggas deal
Seen niggas steal and done seen niggas kill
And them same niggas there, them be the main ones that tell
There's a lotta tension in the air, so nigga easy on them pills
I rather be the bitch that's squeezing than the nigga that's bleeding
See I'mma drink my liquor and I'mma smoke my weed
And I'mma stay far away from y'all buster motherfuckers
Y'all sucker motherfuckers, man fuck you motherfuckers
I'm being convicted of a thug living and drug dealing
Been a two time convicted felon ever since I was a lil' nigga
My first words was curse words, shit, the first bid I did I was just a lil' kid
And I was raised by pimps, hoes and mobsters
Taught the game by dope boys and robbers
I ran the steets with goons, I broke the rules with fools
I used to take my motherfucking tool to school

See I been thuggin all my life, trying to live right, you ain't even got ask
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs, what you know about that
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up)
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up)
You alread know (straight up), Straight up (straight up)

These feds crazy trying to take me down and book me
Throw me on death row and do me like Big Tookie
Got me running from them rookies and poppin at the seargent
Tried to tell not to push me now look what you done started
And you got these rap artists thats beefing on these songs
But I really will kill so I'm leaving that alone
I'm a grown ass man that ain't about playing
Ten G's will get you killed, family will die for twenty grand
Blow my nose with a Gucci rag smoking on a cuban
You damn right I know they mad, cuz half of em' losing
I slip a another clip into my A.K
Stay with Trick in M.I.A. when I come and get the yae
See the Chevy got a stash spot
I can fit a hundred in the back and just mash out
Hope I make it home, it they catch me then I'm gone
So we put it on the line
Everyday we on the grind gotta hustle til' you shine


My blood line is a level above the thug line
And according to the cat scan I ain't a ordinary man
See I run off oil and I breathe off chronic
I power up off money like a motherfucking bionic
I travel through time with a military mind
Strapped with a Russian A.K. and a German made nine
And don't mad at the rappers they ain't the one trying to attack us
It's slimy ass niggas and red neck ass crackers
Y'all better lower your weapons (lower your weapons)
Before my niggas get to steppin
Cuz shit can get real crazy if it was a thug invasion
Imagine a whole bunch of Cuban niggas and Haitians
Rebellion on your ass
For the shit you did to us in the past

Thug Holiday (feat. Latocha Scott),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(trick talking)
Thug holiday, go ahead you can cry its all right baby
Everything gone be gravy later, that's right
This the time when we take time to remember
All the loved ones we lost in the struggle you know
I dedicate this to my brother Hollywood, Toby, Bam
My dog Itchy and Lil Trav, I dedicate this to the struggle
Everybody in the county jail, state penn, check it out
(Trick Daddy)
If it wasn't for bad luck, hell against that a nigga wouldn't have none
But when I think about it, what would I be without my gun
How could I, get away from the po-po's, if a, nigga couldn't run
And how was I given a daughter when I always prayed for a son
Life is crazy ain't it, sometimes I even think the same thing
I've been waiting on freedom to ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, and then he lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love
So I pray for the better days, face the bomb had a run-a-ways
And, I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays, it's crazy
Ain't it
(Chorus: Latocha Scott)
Just like the soldiers that ain't coming home this year
Just like the fellas, in prison, we miss you so much for real
What about the children, who ran away, that ain't coming home today
Well here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most a thug holiday
Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday - 2x
(Trick Daddy)
Here go one for, all these killings and all these conflicts in religion
See the Muslims, Jews and Christians but know they are all God's
Children
There's only, one him, plus ain't none of y'all confronting him
So blind in our own minds we wouldn't even know God if we was in front of him
And, I read your books know all your remixes to the Bible
What about a, verse for the thugs curled with drugs and survival
That's asking chapters naming Martin, Malcolm and Faricon
In all my history books, only one died was the Americans
And, that's point of my, who's responsible for Vietnam
And, hold on there's more, we had two World Wars
And, how come the judges make more than the teachers is making
When they the ones raising all the taxes and got us fighting for
Education
Life is crazy ain't it
(Chorus)
So many tears, through out the years
Somebody tell me what's going on
And so many lives, but only God knows
About the pain deep inside
It gets so hard, you got to keep your head up
I know you're fed up, but stay strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, thug holiday
Just like em, just like em, just like em, a thug holiday - 2x
(LaTocha Scott)
This is for my people in the ghetto
I'm calling out (calling out), calling out (calling out)
To all my thugs in the ghetto
Calling out (calling out)
'Cause it gets hard sometimes, but you
Got to keep your head up, and be strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Really need it the most, a thug holiday

Hoe But Can’t Help It,"Book of Thugs: Chapter A.K., Verse 47",2000.0,"I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it
Cause being raised by a ho is kinda hectic
Old material bitch
Gold-digging for them tender dicks
A real nigga never give you shit Biotch
Born and raised in the motherfucking projects ho
Getting money by at the pak Jam, by the back door
Wearing them shorts up your ass with a tube top
Letting niggas stick they fingers all in the cock
Pussy all big and wet, looking good and shit
Smelling like dead fish
And every week it's the same shit you and that lil shit
And every time I see you, you got to have dick
You wants mo' respect
You gets no respect
And all you want is some hardcore sex
1, 2, 3, yes you know
4, 5, 6, 7 niggas in your hole
Back-to-back from the back, head and all
Doo-doo brown and licked his hairy ass balls
In the streets late-night me, you, and all my boys
What I'm thinking 'bout honey bun (honey bun)
You got the nigga running up in you
Shake it like ""Naww, I'm not trying to do you""
No good freak, is the same but I love you
I'm off in you skin-deep motherfucker let's do it again sometimes you like that, huh?
The next nut going out for your grandma

You'se a ho but you can't help it cause you don't know it
I figure you'se a hoe but you can't help it, cause you don't know it
Oh, Oh, Ho
You'se a hoe but you can't help it, cause you don't know it

Stupid bitch you done dropped out of high school
But who's the fool?
You'se a prime example
You met a nigga named Mike
At the nice Lexus lane looking like grands for the night
Times are hard, you scared, your rent is due
It ain't no limit to the shit you do
You making records in the studio
Telling me it ain't who you know it's who you blow
Shit
I'll hit you up for a gangbang
Have you doing strange thangs for some small change
Keeping it real
Fucking with the wrong pops
Longshoreman on the dock
Head, booty and cock
You get what he got
Shooting tech to his whole cat
Took him home let him hit you from the back
With tax because it's like that
I figure you's a Ho Ho Ho
You can't trust
A bitch with a big butt
You get the guts, then tell that ho to keep in touch
Jimmy-up when I bust her
Fucked her
HIV can't trust her
I got too much to lose
Cash rules
Protect the family jewels
Yeah
And I ain't going out like Easy
Believe me
A nigga disease free

You'se a ho but you can't help it cause you don't know it
I figure you'se a hoe but you can't help it, cause you don't know it
Oh, Oh, Ho
You'se a hoe but you can't help it, cause you don't know it

Had another baby, blame it on the same nigga
Reason being is seeing that he's a dope dealin
Bitch, you'se a fiend you want dick
You wan't much flow
But I can't pay you ho
You dissed Trick
And now you on the hitlist
I dogged you out, and now you getting dick shit
I told my boys
That you make much noise
And you like getting off with those sex toys
A bunch of high school hoes at the Goom-Bay
They got they drawers in they hands like it's okay
They got all the niggas jockin cause they cock fat
The young hoes turning heads cause they got back
Now, they finer than them hoes off TV
But, they fucking every nigga on fifteenth
So I figga
You's a Ho Ho Ho

You'se a ho but you can't help it cause you don't know it
I figure you'se a hoe but you can't help it, cause you don't know it

Got all my homies in tears
And we don't know who the killas is
It could of been the lick
It could of been the hit
I 'on't know we stayed in some shit so
We put his face on a shirt
And shedded tears for the game
(a thug in memory boy)
Cuz it's hard to hide the pain
They teach us some better thangs
And shoot his mama a bag cuz she could use the change
Thats how you ride for yo dogs, shit
Ride or roll take sides for yo dog
Suppose to die for your dogs, shit
Hard time in gangsta livin'
And got us villian chillin'

Ain’t a Thug,Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets,2004.0,"If I ain't a thug
You think I ain't a thug
Tell me what I am

'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

If I ain't a thug, y'all tell me who is
How many other motherfuckers y'all know can do this?
Nigga I'm a thug forever and I never ever
Disrespect the game or cross one of my niggas
Listen, slippin' already cost one of my niggas
So I better select the fools that I be dealin' with
And I don't know nothin', didn't hear or say nothin'
I can't remember but yet, I still won't forget 'em
I'm from the dark side, born and raised in thug life
And I'm out that city full of drug dealers and wise guys
If I ain't a thug then you explain it cuz
How come a young nigga livin' so dangerous?
And why my name always somehow involved in stuff
Through all the years, y'all plan to target us
Yeah, I am thug nigga, but I ain't no drug dealer
Three time convicted felon so I oughta know better

Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

You couldn't shut me up, now you tryna set me up
It's bad enough we had it rough when we was growin' up
You killed Pac and Biggie, now tryina kill us

A thug rebel for certain, that's how I'm livin'
Listen, I ain't the snitchin' kind of nigga
Yo and I'm a different kind of nigga, so you busta can't hit me
Ain't no sentimental nigga, I'm sittin' on spinners nigga
And when I'm draggin' me denims don't you busta try to hit 'em
I'm from the part where stars like them heavy stars
Quality sound beatin' down each and every car
I'm givin' them hell like I'm David Chappelle
Prostitute born male, with plenty dick for sell

'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way?
Why the streets stay on my mind?
Since I am a thug, why do you go get so mad?
Why can't y'all accept that it's my life?

But since I am a thug, that's why you listen to me
'Cause I am a THUG officially, ya see
A lot of niggas still doubt a nigga
So when they conversatin', they be playa hatin' 'bout a nigga
But I expect them to, what else they suppose do?
They dead broke and I got more flow then they do
And they mad 'cause I don't fuck with them
Oh well, stay mad 'cause I don't kiss niggas ass
Listen, I'm too busy bein' a real nigga
So if you fuck with me, you can fuck around and get killed nigga
The truth is Mr. Dollars is the real deal
Hell, I'm the motherfuckin' Dade County mayor, yeah
And I'm strictly for the thugs
Cause I'ma show enough for 'em
Quick to straight fuck ya, nigga what
Pussy nigga what, for my motherfuckin' thugs

Ain’t No Santa,Thug Holiday,2002.0,"Turn it up, Because I have something to say ya'll
Ya'll pay attention ova there representing Page County
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody doin songs talking about what they got
And they jewelry and they cars
I'm gonna talk about something else we never had shit, we real

And there damn sure ain't no Santa Clause because, if it was
Like Santa we would be having a Thanksgiving dinner
While ya'll was dreaming of a white Christmas
I was out chillen wit my niggas out spilling trying to make a living
And if I robbed for a million
I just hope God would forgive me after I spent it on his children
See I was born in the struggle
89 stepdaddy's me and my mother and ten others
Let's see thats three sisters and 7 brothers
All we had was each other and or daddy because I love him
I never seen a flying reindeer
So if Rudolph called dog ya'll just tell him I ain't here
And I ain't the grinch who like to steal Christmas
But if you pay attention you'll learn a lesson just listen
See I believe dat the children know our future
But if you don't raise them right they'll grow up and shoot cha

Ya'll best beleave that all these lies you know what I'm saying?
Fibb's and all des story's be like history one month out the year you know?
All dat walking Martin Luther King did and they only gave him justice one time
You tried to frame OJ and beat the shit out of Rodney King? Hell
(Trick Daddy)
I was born amongst racism
That's why the police hate me and I can see it in their faces
Yeah they wanna give nigga cases
And they wanna see me in jail hell they can't wait to take me
Wanna hog tie me and take my bar
Take me off around Christmas cracker don't make me run
If you know the moral to the words of this song
What about the words of Rodney King ""Can't we all get along?""
Huh cause niggas just when I nervous back
Matter fact saying those ova there where them terrorist and they ain't coming back
Til Bin Laden and all those fighters are found dead
Shot up in the mountains of Al-Qeda

I'd kill all dem motherfuckers every last one of them all them son of a bitches
All them funny names motherfuckers disrespecting my country and my people
I wish ya'll would get yo fuck ass out of my face
Free at last my ass Mr. President you ain't even press me
You ain't even get them to justice yet, you better go get 'em

Mr. President tell me why my people doin bad
Some blacks wit no dads doin bad shooting bad
And fo sho getting a limo got a wardrobe
And I'm stuck wearing dis niggas clothes
Hell I go to school and dem teachers straight dog me
I try to learn but my brain just won't
I'm not dumb but mad and sad which I should be
You tried framing me
I'm forced to live wit out a job or work at McD's
Or I could rob Circuit City and get 5 or 3
Slang a 'caine its no thing, but I'm scared to of tab
And if you think I'm gonna change you can kiss my ass

I just wanna say use that enough for personal use, only personal use only
No capital a finces no way forst degree misdemeanors haha
And there damn sure ain't no Santa Clause haha

Ruby Red,UnKnown,2009.0,"Early In the mornin when im feelin low
I smoke two blunts of dro, and a cup full of lean
My girls takin pills and blow
Two lines of coke dat I cut wit drano
And her nose starts to bleed
The most beautiful ruby red
I been gettin high since back in junior high
The problems I had back then I still got 'em now
I got them worst tho, cuz I always got a sore throat
My eyes stay red, and all my clothes smell like weed smoke
I think my kids know
Man I hope my kids dont use and try some of the shit me and my parents did
I need to detox
I probably need god in my life dats why my heart ain't been beatn right
And im bout to relapse I got to get up and get out and run about 3 laps
And sit back and relax no more of that brah
Where that clean at I need to clean up my act, man I really mean that
Early In the mornin when im feelin low
I smoke two blunts of dro, and a cup full of lean
My girls takin pills and blow
Two lines of coke dat I cut wit drano
And her nose starts to bleed
The most beautiful ruby red
The most beautiful ruby red
Man the truth is, smokin is stupid and cigeretts are so ignorant
Plus they do kill you know its bad when you dont remember where you live
And its kinda sad when you dont remember shit you did
They tried to off me
Offered me coffee
One more addiction wit dis one it'll cost me
So im hollin mayday prayin for my payday
You'll still be on dat yay i'll be on my last days of A.A
I left bobby like whitney im on a whole different system
No more addiction too many headaches dey leave the heartaches
So no more chest pains dat would be da best thing

Look how far we come (doin what we love)
Doin what we love (cause these are the days)

And I remember back in the days, if you ain't like a nigga
You let him know, then you asked for a fave
And then he coulda got a head up
Me and you after school in the front and we can tear it up
And everybody gon' know about it
Yep, so put down your set, and shut up, and be sho' about it
Cause everybody done lost one
But don't come home cryin unless your ass mind another one
And your ass better fight back
And you bet' not run and let it get back to mom
Cause, daddy ain't made no punks (uh-uh)
And, momma ain't raised no chumps (no way)
So, go 'head for what you know
Cause a lil' childhood fight's alright, but that's as far as it goes
Cause tomorrow we'll be best of friends
Never ever disagreein, now that's a friend, c'mon

Now leave the guns and the crack and the knives alone

See trouble right in front your home
Far as the kid's concerned, let him live and learn
And let him grow to be older than us
Teach him more than gangbangin, drug deals and hold-ups
And slow up, hold that drinkin just a little bit
And when they wanna get high, just let 'em hear this
And let 'em hit it 'til they OD
Cause when they sober up, they gon' love and respect us
Now we havin mo' doctors, lawyers
Teachers, preachers, and deep-sea explorers

Whatever happened to the momma and daddy jokes
And why you cuss so much, right in front of these old folks

That's twice my age, and fo' times yours
I know momma taught you better than that
Believe stuff like this'll give the ol' girl a heart attack
Always hollerin about child abuse and child neglect
Where the hell did you get that?
Shit the last time I checked
You ever lost self-respect, you got it put on your ass for that
And it happened right there where it went wrong
Part one's now, part two's at home
So from now on, it's yes ma'am or no sir
Put that behind you, questions and answers
Followed by thank you or no thanks
Or father may I be excused without bein rude

Hold on, so this here should teach you a lesson y'know
Kids, y'know listen to your teachers at school and
Parents, need to pay attention to your kids at home
Therefore uh, know how to be hard on a child abuser
Child neglecter, where e'rybody nobody call HRS on us
Beat they lil' bad ass when they get out of line
That's what my momma did - fo' sho'

I Luv,www.thug.com,1998.0,"I love
(I love)
I love it
(I love it baby)
Love this
(I love it, love it)
Love, oh!, love this
(I love it girl)
Love
(Oh you really want it girl?)
Love
(I love this shit)
Love this
(Beatch!)

She was a betty I done knew back in the day
Little scary lil' bitch from around the way
Plus she sucked and fucked all day
With a little bit of Alize
(Alize, Alize)
I put it down for these young hoes
Get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin' porno
Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself would she?
I get deep in her mind and her pussy
Who dat? She was the world's greatest, dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while, finger fuck her
I hit it in the dark in the back of the Benz
Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends
Face down, ass up, bitch be still while I bust this nut
I rock hard while I'm in these guts
Wipe my dick and then that's enough
She wanna kiss me after she done lick me
Slap the drunk, you know the ho got Tinesi
Daz, this punk bitch wanna get with me
'Cuz the ho lookin' for a P I M P
You know the ho don't know no better
I would rough ride ya ass, but the Magnum's better
I know a lot of niggas done paid ya bitch
Remember one thing, I got a major bitch
Pull up on the stroll, in the fo' door Caddy
Slapped the bitch, she hollered No, no daddy!
I got the cash, if she don't that's her ass
So quick, so fast

I love gettin' my head blown
I love gettin' my nuts rubbed
I love gettin' my dick licked
I love gettin' my nuts sucked
I love gettin' my pussy ate
I love when niggas see me masturbate
I love it when you nut all in my face
I love it baby, but I can't stand the taste

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a Geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the Ferris Wheel
Been pimpin' all my life, big player for real
I said, ""Come on girl, you know how it's 'sposed to be
It's makin' me nut, but feel our fantasy
Come on, come on baby, won't you get the best of me
(I smell pussy)
Get T double D on the double stack
And one dose of the dick, she be doublin' back
See me, I've been known to shit on hoes
Cuff her cold, straight spit on hoes
I been known to step on a bitch
Put a thumb in your ass, while I slap your clit
But ain't no way that I'ma lick yo' shit
Tell 'em what she is Short Dog
(Beitch!)

I love gettin' my head blown
I love gettin' my nuts rubbed
I love gettin' my dick licked
I love gettin' my nuts sucked
I love gettin' my pussy ate
I love when niggas see me masturbate
I love it when you nut all in my face
I love it baby, but I can't stand the taste
I love gettin' my head blown
I love gettin' my nuts rubbed
I love gettin' my dick licked
I love gettin' my nuts sucked
I love gettin' my pussy ate
I love when niggas see me masturbate
I love it when you nut all in my face
I love it baby, but I can't stand the taste
I love, gettin' my thug on
On dirty joints, in the shcool zone
I love gettin' my thugs on
Everything that's copper, put dubs on
(I love this)

When I'm at the club
See a girl get freaky and I slap her butt
She try to say, ""Short Dog, that's enough""
You know I love it little mam, can't pass it up
('Cuz I)

I love gettin' my head blown
I love gettin' my nuts rubbed
I love gettin' my dick licked
I love gettin' my nuts sucked
I love gettin' my pussy ate
I love when niggas see me masturbate
I love it when you nut all in my face

So High,Back By Thug Demand,2006.0,"[Intro, Trey Songz & 
Trick Daddy
]
Trick Daddy Dollaz
Eightball, Trey Songz
We high
Good evenin' ladies and gentleman
This is your captain speakin' to ya
I'd like to welcome all of you aboard my flight
A flight that's promised to take you high
Way high up in the sky
So get out ya blunts
Ya Dutchmasters and ya Backwoods
And I'll turn ya seatbelt signs off

I only smoke the best bud
Jamaica and Bahamas got the best herb, yes sir
I could smoke, toke after toke
Won't give a triple choke and it won't hurt my throat, nope
Chinky eyed, just ridin' and vibin' on that real fire
Be high for two, three hours
And I'm cool with A-I, but hey
I ain't too much into Phillie's but split a Dutch and I'll re-fill it
And I ain't friendly, so nope, ya can't hit it
I smoke good trees, your collard greens full of reefer seeds
You use too many chemicals
Too much added stuff, fool, it ain't real kush
One joint of that G-14
Will have you higher than your highest dreams, just floatin'
Not knowin' if you're comin' or goin'
But when it's partly cloudy, be prepared for the storm and get high

Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
High, high, high
Deep inside, high, we so high
High, deep inside, high, we so high
High, feel the vibe, high, lay back, enjoy the ride

Roll a Cigarillo, fire it up and hit it
Feels so good man, it's hard for me to quit it
M-I-A, land of the palm trees
T double D came through with the bomb trees
And when a nigga inhale this
I had to put my shades on, get behind tint
In the clouds, lookin' down on the ground
Eightball, big black playa from the mound
Remember when, I used to have them dime-sacks
Lil ma circle by my house with the weed trap
Now my Zip-Lock's be full of bubble-kush
Spark it like a broad's bush when she's on douche
Fruit cocktail, you could tell by the smell
Burn one, let the whole club know I'm here
Let's fly tonight
Come ride with your boy and get high tonight
[Intermission: Trey Songz & 
Trick Daddy
]
Feel the vibe
Ain't nothin' like bein' able to smoke-smoke good-good
Enjoy the ride, deep inside
And be way up here in the air
We so high
Away from all the troubles
Feel the vibe
And problems that's goin' on down there in the real world
Enjoy the ride
Oh, it feel good, don't it?
Deep inside, we so high

Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high

The only people I know, who don't smoke
Is Jesus, C-O, and my last P-O
Yo, but I ain't on papers no more
Ain't gotta creep and sneak, at least not to blow
I spent my first two years gettin' high
By smokin' dollar joints rolled outta 1.5's
That was 'round '84, '85
Smoke all week for the dimes, now nigga, that's live
Visine to help clear my eyes
Sprayed cologne on, when it was time for me to go home
I been doin' this for twenty years
Ain't never seen or heard one man that weed done killed
So just chill, take a puff here, there
To bring ya down a lil' off ya pills
After that, go and eat'cha a meal
But you gon' have to bathe ya ass to get the smell out your hair, yeah

Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe, lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside, exhale, we so high

Sad enough, yours truly
The booger-man himself
'Bout to take you all across the world
Take ya everywhere with the electric chair
Gon' let you see anythin' with the wind
But then again
You'll never get high like this again
Come again my friends",https://genius.com/Trick-daddy-so-high-lyrics

(Chorus)
Im riding hard in the donk/
Lookin big in the donk/
Gotta get it in my donk/
Steady grillin in my donk/
Im riding with my top down/(Top Down)/
Im just trying to put my mack down/
And Im just flossin in my heavy chevy/
X2
(Verse 1)
I feel like an old Seven tray impala/
Wit no doors and no windows/
Wit no oil/no g*d dam**d water/
Been riding around for over 200, 000 miles/
With no tags/no insurance/
On some old bald head a** tires/
My alignment off/timing off/
S**t lookin real bad/
Cuz Im down to my last quarter tank of gas/
Good thing the weathers in fair condition/
Cuz where Im from/
All year long n****s need air condition/
But I ain't got none cuz my compressor gone/
And I keep hearing a tick tick tick ticker sound/
I think one of my heads is blown/
They say for 1500 I can get it rebuilt/
But I ain't got a dime/
Im going through some hard times/
I ain't lyin/
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
You know s**t get rough/
Every year around the same time/
The longer you wait/the longer its gonna take for you to calm it down/
And its gon take more than a check for X to pimp my ride/
Ima need me a new blockbuster deal/
For a n***a to live/
Its gon take shady 4, 5 maybe 6 mil/
I done did 6 albums n***a/
This s***s real/
And now you trippin/
Cuz my transmission ain't slippin/
I ain't getting no younger/
Im damn near 50/
Ive been ticketed and towed/
And broke down on the side of the road/
Steering column been broke up/
But never been sold/
So this time Ima need me some insurance/
I need me some medical/and dental/and some gangsta a** instrumentals/
So I can get this s**t all chromed out/
Painted candy apple green/
The wettest s**t a n***a ever seen/
If daddy dollars can't do it/
G*d dam**t it must can't be done/
And I must be a motherf****n pearl shine/
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Ain't nothing like and ol full tank of gas/
Ain't nothing like being waxed and washed/
Then being valet parked/
And I got rid of that old bad cough/
Got me a new cam and exhaust/
A n***a pushing 500 horses/
And thats without the spray/
Get out my way/
Get out your car/
This green thing/
Is a motherf****n superstar/
The American Idol of the Chevy game/
Trick Daddy Dollars/
Don Dada/
A f****n donk rider/

Bout My Money,"Book of Thugs: Chapter A.K., Verse 47",2000.0,"Let's see, what to do today?
Fuck that I'm goin to get my money
This one in a.. Thuggin memory
That thug nigga
Hollywood nigga
I did this one in that nigga name
Hollywood nigga, yall remember that mutha fuckin name
This bout that mutha fuckin money
NIGGA!!!!!!

A ki of cocaine will get a nigga killed
And a banana peel will get his whole hide flipped
He's bringin danger to the life of his home boy's
You can see the moon, but don't let him go alone boy
About my money, we gon' bump heads and it won't be long
So I got two choppers, one for the car, and one for the home
Got extra clips for when they all gone
Nextel, instead of these dial tones
And quarter game for these old tapped ass cell phones
And new back bone for my new trailer home
You ain't been outta jail long, but nigga you dead wrong
I'm bout my money, nigga you shouldn't a played wit it
You're goin to remember the day when this A.K hit ya

I'm bout my money
No shit and ain't nothin funny
Don't start duckin and runnin when it go to gunnin bout my money
And sonny, don't be stuntin and lookin funny
When I ask about my mutha fuckin money
No shit and ain't nothin funny
Don't start duckin and runnin when it go to gunnin bout my money
And sonny, don't be stuntin and lookin funny
Have my mutha fuckin money

I read it in the Book of Thugs, Chapter A.K Verse 47
And it tells me all thug niggas go to heaven
But between the lines of verses 48 and 9
It speaks on thug nigga's, drug dealin and doin time
But verse 100, talks about my money
Say's its full of blood so off him if it's funny
But nigga I don't want to hold your gold
I just want to free your soul
And be seen somewhere in public when all this shit unfolds
I done gave ya two bricks, and you ain't gave me back shit
You riding 'round in your new bubble life
While my vert sit lookin sick
Nigga I ain't here to cause no scene, I just want my cream
And you can keep your little watch and ring that go bling bling

I'm 'bout my money
No shit and ain't nothin funny
Don't start duckin and runnin when it go to gunnin bout my money
And sonny, don't be stuntin and lookin funny
When I ask about my mutha fuckin money
No shit and ain't nothin funny
Don't start duckin and runnin when it go to gunnin bout my money
And sonny, don't be stuntin and lookin funny
Have my mutha fuckin money

Now all this huffin and puffin
Ain't goin to get you young fuck nigga's nothin
But a shit bag and bullet holes through your bloody clothes
Out of all the nigga's you mutha fuckin know
I should have been the last nigga you want to muthafuckin know
I'll meet ya at your front door, and im bringin my calico
Nigga if u ain't got my flow yo ass gots to go
We'll get yo mammy dem I lay em all down on the front room floor
I'm 'bout to do em all cuz I done had problems out of y'all before
I'm bout my money, I came at it, and your son ain't have it
Now this nigga I owe is goin to be the next nigga to go
Cus I ain't got 20 G's, and I owe 'em 84
It ain't my muthafuckin fault, I'm short bout 64
This nigga ain't goin to fuck me no more, fuck I need him for

I'm 'bout my money
No shit and ain't nothin funny
Don't start duckin and runnin when it go to gunnin bout my money
And sonny, don't be stuntin and lookin funny

Kill-a-Head,Based on a True Story,1997.0,"I feel like I'm too hard to die man
I feel like I can't see faded, you know?
I feel like can't no nigga fade me
I feel like I'm the hardest nigga to walk the earth and shit
You know what I'm saying?

Blaaah!
Steady comin got you runnin for your damn life
I'm busting shots with this Glock, nigga act right
You crossed this nigga how you playin I'm a naughty head
The last bitch got 4 shots to the head
I squeezed off and watched his brain hit the concrete
Last breath, last motherfucking heartbeat
There was no motive for the murder on the straight tip
And all you seen was blood and brains every damn where
So I refuse to shoot a nigga in his stomach or his face or his forehead (killa!)

Kill-a-head and the body dead
Kill-a-head and the body dead

Come down, your best bet is to sport a vest
Nevertheless
I'm leaving a mess
Nigga, fuck your chest
Hollow points leaving brains on the front seat
Fuck with me and I'mma set you free nigga
Pop my trunk check out my funk
Nothing but pumps
Leave that ass smelling like raw conch
You coochie niggas playing with it you gon get shitted
Metro wants to know who did it
Now ain't nobody rapping to the fucking cops
And if they do we coming back for 'lick them blood clots
We killing bitches not to mention snitches everyday
The 9 Glock triple platinum in the MIA

The graveyeard is my home
Tombstones and bones
Murder weapons is the case now don't hearse my bone
Headhunting is my hobby who the victim be
And who's next on my everyday headless spree
My gravedigger got a fade with a nappy top
Now I'm a fool and a freak for them dreadlocks
Quick to pull a trigger cuz that's all I know
Robbing creeps raping hoez and just slanging dope
I got my masters in disaster
I'm like Andrew kick in your door at your hoe mad, your dawg too
I'm new in town your ain't heard man Jason Lee
Satisfied to his ass I had him begging please
I went to hell now I'm back and I'm hellafied
Took over down there made the devil cry
I'm a bad motherfucker with a bad rep
I got a trophy in my mouth for every bitch I killed
I killed my wife and my kids, my parents too
I killed my posse and my friends, I'm after you
I crash your party kill your bed smoke some killer man
What the fuck, I'm deaf fucking up, and I'm 'on Kill again

Kill-a-head and the body dead

I'm paranoid 'cause I'm hearing thangs
Time served only out a few months, associated with birds
They wanna plot, but I got bad nerves
Peep, milli 14 on the front seat
You want to be there for your kids, nigga play with it
It's grounds missing who did it?  I'mma deal with it
So 'fuck I care about your shawty?
Nigga you been naughty
You skipped town with two pounds of my doo-doo brown
Naw nigga how you playing I done counted that
You wanted work, all you had to do is fucking ask
My cuban friend want his ends
Instead of you flipping the dividends straight to me and him you cop a benz
Silly rabbit you dont started stabbing, now I got to let you have it
Rapid-fire from my automatic
You left me stuck so now you out of luck
'Cause you done fucked my credit up

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Coochie nigga what fuck another minute you won't get to spend it
I'm licking shots like a dread, bitch, Kill-a-head

This for the boys that's on the grind/
Servin bids and doin crime/
Stuck in the pen and doin time/
Facin 10, 20, Life/
(Verse 1)
Make ways of the 90's/
Babies havin babies (Babies havin babies)/
N*****s dyin young/
Boy this s**t crazy/
You got drugs and guns/
But a n***a need them/
Prospect for a jack/
Then you can squeeze them/
To his head/
Left him deader than a doorknob/
Chose to rob/
He should have got a muthaf****n job/
His kids left without a pops/
Cuz he got shot/
His mama struggle every 5/
Now she slangin her car/
Probably lost full cost/the bills are late/
S****y diapers on her babies/
And they haven't ate/
So she flex/catch a date/its her duty though/
She never h*'d but it's the only way to go/
She turned a trick/got a bare buck/food to eat/
The bills are due in one week/so she'll be back on the street/
She get a check/but that ain't s**t but the f****n rent/
And food stamps in the wind/that ain't s**t to spend/
Oldest child is her son in the 7th grade/
And he'll just be turning 12 on his birthday/
A small boy with a brain to make a good life/
But he don't sleep at night/
So he can't function right/
Sister needin a crib/
He gots to pull through/
Quit school/snatched a book/and hit for grands too/
He was in love wit school/now they won't let him back/
He started hangin with the boys/now he slangin crack/
He got this young girl pregnant/what she gon do/
Have a baby hope his daddy don't die too/
The young n****'s in the county on the 10th floor/
Jumped out and roped him with a little dope/
His first charge so they gave him house arrest/
He better chill/cuz he don't know the prison next/
He left his crib one night/went out hangin out/
He wasn't home when the c******s came by the house/
Now he up the road at
Brevard
Wit a year to do/
Now he wildin' already doin his whole two/
His little shorty bout to walk/soon to talk/
His mama is the daddy/because that is all he saw/
(Chorus)
And now this n***a need money up the road/
Plus a pair of shoes and socks to wear to vis her/
She try to visit every week now she dead broke/
She missed one weekend because she needed flow/
He cursed her out/called her names/made the girl cry/
She won't accept his phone calls/and he wonder why/
She got another n***a in her life now/
She tired of kissin a** and getting cursed out/
He found the will to chill/now he on the turf/
Told the girl lies/Promised that he gon work/
She left that n***a/went back to that same jit/
He copped a vert/on ther corner doin the same s**t/
She sayin/You told me things/and I believed them all/
They stay together/got a condo up in C.C./
A water bed/big screen t.v./
He getting money but he ain't savin none up/
Dropped a grip/bought his big new dodge truck/
He sixteen but he deep in the dope game/
Got connections to them boys slangin cocaine/
He got a name/all the h**s call him diamond d**k/
But he got robbed one night for this big lick/
They had the ups/he couldn't buck/down to gave it up/
They got all his jewelry/10 grand/and his new truck/
And now he back on his d**k but he pissed off/
He knew the jack boys got him/go and take em out/
He got drunk one night and told his boys off in the hood/
How he got his money back and now he doin good/
He ridin round his city with the same gun/
Police pulled the boy/booked a murder 1/

Living in a World,www.thug.com,1998.0,"For all my children, huh, let 'em know
Sing for me

Living in a world where hearts are cold, yea yea ya'll
Living in a city where thugs don't live that long, so
Sleeping in a home where only gangsta's rome, all nite long and ah
Thuggin there for days wit my g's and we pray, help us Lord

I done seen it all, done even lost a couple dogs
Everything from seeing hoes boosting in the mall
Niggas who used to ball, they ain't ballin' now
Hoes who hated me, dem bitches callin' now
And mama told me, but she never told me when
She said when money come sin, its some fake ass friends
I keep niggas in da blind, and outta mind
Cuz broke niggas full of slime and they got dirt on they mind
Catch me slipping never, and not once, ever ever
Lost a bank to the better I'm a muthafucking fool my self
I can't fool myself, cause if I ever slip, they gotta have that there
Two years ago, I lost a friend in da line of thuggin'
He got drunk out clubbin'
Some niggas followed him home, a Glock nine to the dome
It wasn't long for he was gone
For a set of d's and quarter ki's we lose to many men
And now to many man, understand how to be the man
See the man lied, so the man died, I seen the devils in his eyes
Though the man in the skys eyeing

Living in a world where hearts are cold, yea yea ya'll
Living in a city where thugs don't live that long, so
Sleeping in a home where only gangsta's rome, all nite long and ah
Thuggin there for days wit my g's and we pray, help us Lord

Never confuse luv with lust
Retailate bust for bust
You can trust in us, we spit that venomous
It's either, them or us, ash to ash, sell the dust
We go to war for the peace, ignore the police
I still believe that its the east that invented
See the west complemented, they always represent it
And all my peoples down south keeps it weed scented
Better focus, when I put this hocus pocus on the cd
I drop mine in braile so them blind cats can read me
I'm the cat that curiosity killed, prophesy filled
I'm still water that run deeper than hole pussy
Get pushy in the clutch, roll up like Dutch Masters
I cuts and slashs, plus I, flows like Casius
It's warless clashes you need credit in the last days
So when them gats spray, do crime pay when you get shot
That's why I stay calm like www dot, cd
For who seeks the actual article
You heard it live its certified, mechanic on the mother ship
The alien, I changed the course of them with the wings
I would love to be considered sin in a physical form
Like I'm born to be crucified and mother was born to cry
Taught bitches born to live long and bastards are born to die
And God and the devil just don't see eye to eye
Coz ya'll thugs don't understand that the devil gone always lie

Living in a world where hearts are cold, yea yeah ya'll
Living in a city where thugs don't live that long, so
Sleeping in a home where only gangsta's rome, all nite long and ah
Thuggin there for days wit my g's and we pray, help us Lord
Living in a world where hearts are cold, yea yeah ya'll

Duck Down,Thug Mentality,2006.0,"MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down

And if he don't know, y'all better let him know
My niggas got .40s, if they bring them out, they gon' let them go
Imagine 36 rounds plus 36 more
Counting his head, chest, and car doors, that's 72 fucking holes
And if his homies act up, then that's what the MAC for
They get one warning shot and then after that, fire, (shut him up)
If you're riding with him, fuck nigga, you're dying with him
You can run and hide, but in a matter of time, oh, I'll get him
And the first sight of him, I'll put that light on him
And every red dot is gon' turn them into blood clots
First, it's gon' be heavy bleeding
And then his eyes gon' roll to the back of his head, his pulse weak and he's barely breathing
Ain't no hollerin' ""Red Rock""
You done already used up your wish, bitch, all you get is headshots
So when the MAC sound, niggas better duck down
I'm from Dade County, nigga, we don't fuck around

MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down

Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down

I'm talking four goons hanging out of four windows
With four choppers going off, all at one nigga
With 50 shots a piece, if we don't kill you, God was with you
So when you hear that (toot-toot-toot-toot), that mean it's official
And down here, it ain't money, choppers the main gesture
The streets the wrong place to hang when you got that thing with you
The only choppers I buy the ones with soft triggas
So when I squeeze that motherfucker, I know I'm gon' hit you
So if your money ain't right, better keep your mouth closed
'Cause when you're beefing in these streets, your trap gotta close
And where we see your pussy ass at, we're letting them go
Trash bags over the choppers so no shells hit the floor
You ain't got to be here to see it, but I'll bet you hear about it
Four niggas ski'ed up in all black, straight wilding
Them niggas let down them windows, them choppas went to hollering
Them niggas road off busting and left folks thumping

MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, we don't fuck around, nigga, we don't fuck around

MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down

Motherfuckers thought I slipped, right?
You didn't know the extra clips on my hip, right?
Ricochet off the vertebrae, dead splat
Now starts the cardiac arrest, where's your vest?
You forgot, now you slowly dropped 'cause your heart stopped beating
Your bitch ass crew is retreating
Niggas left you fucked up. passed out with your ass out
Pockets ran through, stripped with your brains bashed out

Tell me, have you ever seen
Less bone fragments or remains of a man that's been slain by one of them things?
Laying way ten feet away from his brain
Holding his kidneys and his hands and pissed and shitted all in his pants?
Laying there, dead in his own blood
And I can't even explain how big the hole in his head was
So gon’ ahead and yellow tape it
Quarantine the scene, nobody leaves until they mark all the shell cases

MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down
Duck-duck down, duck down, duck-duck down
MAC-11's cocked back, niggas better duck down

Cause he jammed in it
My dog got slammed in it
I even lost Bam in it, wait a damn minute
This the street life, cracker think a nigga fadeless
Cause I'm tryin' to make it out the matrix, fuck this nigga

And nigga's die cause they live on dope
And I remember when I told 'cha Roe
I would've shed blood for ya'
A nigga still got much love for ya'
Nigga, believe that, and yeah Money Mark mean that
Until the day a nigga lean back
This how a nigga show you real love
A dedication to them real thugs
Cause we the last one's livin'

Ride or die, holla thug life

Buddy Roe you better hold on
Cause when the crackers catch ya' they'll hide 'cha ass for so long
And they'll ship ya' ass so far
They'll probably (???) turn round duce things in yo' car
Hell, I rather the go to war with 'em
They got guns but my guns skreeting mo' with 'em
Bullets that explode in 'em
Huh, and I don't see no vest

That rapid fire hit 'em right in the chest
His mammy gotta right 'em a check
For the rose for the dead man

Leave me your number and I'll holla back
You prefer your pet name, nickname, no big thang girl, I'll call you that
Won't be no problem with no other woman
Cause you the one I chose, in other words, fuck dem other hoes
And if a man, gon' be a man, are you really a wo-man
Is this really what you want, and is you sho'?
Are you ready to be committed?
Do you plan on spendin the rest of your life with a nigga?
Have you even thought about it, weighed out all your options
Made your mind up with no doubt about it
If not, we oughta talk about it
But stick with it, don't let dem sick bitches, talk you out it

Homey to marry and see a couple in thug matrimony

I need a woman that's down for me, one who'll love
Respect and honor her nigga, do it all no matter what
Just one lifetime - wouldn't be long enough
For us to be together, at least not for us
And if I'm ever in a jam, be there for me
And keep it real with a player cause you care for me
With no strings attached, when you rub on my back
Greasin my strap, kissin my neck baby I'm lovin that
I got this thang that I do with my tongue
I wanna do it to you, but it might make you cum
But it'll cure you of your back spasms
Have you floatin while your motion in your ocean gotcha backpedallin
And we can take it to another level
And get elevated, gettin way mo' creative
And you can slap me if it makes you happy
But if you scratch and bite me, that only shows me you like me
See, we can do big thangs
I make you scream my name and blame it all on the whip cream
And if you're down with me, I'll have you down and dirty
I do my thang for certain, just tell me if it's hurtin

I Wanna Sang,Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets,2004.0," Whassup little man, what's wrong wit'chu?
 Why you lookin so sad - what's wrong?
Man, I went to school today
And the teacher said I couldn't be no rapper
 Say what?  Why she tell you that?
She told me I had to be somethin, that's more realistic
Like I could actually be, like a construction worker or somethin
 Man, construction workers ain't realistic man
 You can't be out there done sawin all day, boy it's hot out there
 Man, just keep on goin to school, get your education
 That way, you can be anything you WANT to be

I just wanna sing, can I, sing you a song
I bet you'll love it (I just wanna sing) yeah yeah yeah
(I-I ain't askin for much)
 Well go 'head then
I just wanna sing, can I, sing you a song
I bet you'll love it (I ain't askin for much)

Listen; I just wanna make music, I just wanna verse or two
In fact, man, I wanna be a rapper too
And I could probably sing the blues
Cause I got problems too, plus I growed up in the projects too
Well can you put me on your soundtrack?
Cause I got a good theme song that Betty Right could probably sing on
Yo, I just want a chance at stardom
I just wanna be more than a thief or robbin
Well, what about a remix?  And I could probably make the beat
And get it done all in less than a week
And make it clean for the radio, so the kids could watch the video
Yo, but y'all don't hear me doe
Man, I just want a crack at it
If I fail I'll be back, cause I refuse to be a crack addict
I wanna prove the critics wrong
What started off with a poem done turned it into a song
Now I'ma sing it for you
 w/ minor variations

Listen to me!  I wanna be a legend one day, that way
I can be put in the same category with Barry White and Marvin Gaye
And have a tribute dedicated to me
Sell platinum records and win Grammys so that the world can see
You could be anything that you want to be
Play sports or make music, just put your mind to it
And yo, I ain't the typical 'American Idol'
But when I'm done, I'm sure the boy Simon'll like me
Everybody can't act rap, and no matter how real the dream seem
E'rybody can't sing
But, there's another Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods
Somewhere right in the hood, plus
Yo you ain't never seen a, meaner team
Of tennis players than Venus and Serena
So, it's people like that that helped people like me
And they gave me the courage to sing, so I'ma sing it for ya
 w/ minor variations

I wanna do commercial and TV shows
I wanna blow and sell records like the BeeGees sold
And I don't really need a chaffeur, I don't need a maid or a cook
Just a vacumn cleaner and coasters
And I can cook and clean for myself - with the right promo team
I feel, I can really do big things, and
I could probably write me a book
With all the stuff I got to tell 'em, it's got to be a best seller
And it's way deeper than a Coke and a smile
Why go to schools when the teachers ain't helpin us out?
My art teacher drive a Benz but he ain't bein artistic
I got music second period but the class won't listen
I wanna sing
 w/ minor variations

So, to all the kids
All the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers of the world
Y'know?  Our kids need encouragement
We need a reason, y'knahmsayin?
Let's show 'em somethin, let's give 'em somethin to look forward to
So all you teachers that ain't doin your job, y'all step aside
Cause I got a little brother and sister that's gon'
Grow up one day and be a teacher, and she gon' actually TEACH somethin
Y'know?  She gon' make it worth comin to school y'know?
It's deeper than free lunch now
I just wanna sing
I used to be just like you
But thank God, we got greater later",https://genius.com/Trick-daddy-i-wanna-sang-lyrics

You mother fuckers done lost y'all mind
Y'all done bumped y'all mother fuckin head
Now there's got to be somethin done bout all this shit that's occurrin
I don't like it
I don't like it one mother fuckin bit

Free me
I've been captured by some demons
They drainin my blood
Taken samples of my semen
Got the nerve to call me crazy
Tappin all my telephones
Questioning my lady's
But I trained them every summer
Hope to ball and never fumble
Survive in the jungle
Instincts like Stevie Wonder
Rainy days, I'll be the thunder
No carma and no drama
So I gots to ask my mama
Yo, why Kenny left me starvin
Didn't daddy do his part?
She explained she had a heart
She did all that she could do; She kept her faith in god
That's hard

I'm holding in my hand an original copy of the emancipation proclamation
Much to my dismay I noticed that Lincoln forgot to sign it
And that means technically I'm still a slave and you're still a slave owner

I rest around the roudy bout it g niggas
And niggas who wanna be known as thugs
Livin the life because they wanna boom in money and drugs
But ain't no love when they spray
Pray for them everyday
Cause they kill ya dead and take ya bread if you play with they late
To my dismay my niggas ain't no thugs
They some slaves tryin to runaway to a better day
And anything in they way, they gonna crush it
But if ain't about that flow then don't discuss it
Plopin and pumpin we off the chain and disgusted
Willin to die for anything, and that's official
Without or with you, pistol be government issued
With the scrached off word so the Tre would be observed
We serve, L-Ron fuckin with nerve

See no like myself
See I hear no, speak no, see no evil
Except for them demons that be by lookin like everyday people
Tryin to get up in my mindframe, stop me from doing my thang
See if I was a killa, y'all would hear my nine milli {WHAT} bang
But na that never was my skillo, Funk Boogie mostly just be like chillen
Dealin wit these crooked villains, standin ready like Freddie
Tryin to whoop a nigga for somethin
That's why I'm on the rock so for sure they gets nothin
Except a nigga asscrack, kiss it, runaway slave, that's the click
We set you free nigga, break yourself from the clinch

I don't even really wanna hear what you got
Just sign me right when I come for my cheese
Ain't too many niggas down like these
Stand right there while I count my B's
If anything missin' get a hole in your knees
Freeze
I might talk low but I don't stutter
Hot ones go right through like butter
If you feel like a big dog, bite don't ball
Hell, you can get it too if I pull your card

Remember Money sparks the name
And it ain't no thang to do a nigga 'bout change

It's gettin strange, and dangerous, but that's the way shit goes

This nigga needs no introductions
I'm on this book, and I'm stuck, I'm really the wrong one to fuck wit
See T-Double known for startin problems but
K-cutter be the problem solver, if I
Sell you a book nigga stick it
Cause for every you check you slippin they can call me Flipper
I only I missed a few niggas (uh-huh)
But he lost a couple more vis-a kidney and his liver
Had to tell him mind me a nigga
I was like uh-huh, click click, c'mere, don't run nigga
All I wanna know is
Where yo' connect, where the sack, where the money where the blow is
I heard papi got them freighters
Now either he gon', give 'em to me, or a nigga gon' take 'em
The dope game's just too overrated
And to tell y'all the truth a lot of y'all ain't gon' make it
Done went from crack slingers to R&B singers
Before the mic's on, you was already singin
It's just a song was a big hit
He named me and his bitch on the remix (sing)

Somebody better tell 'em
And put him up on {?} somebody fuck around and kill him
You see cause snitches get stitches
And there ain't that much of a difference between tellin and snitchin
And I ain't gon' keep on talkin to you niggas
I'm gon' walk right up to you niggas and go off on you niggas
And I ain't leavin no witnesses
And don't get drunk and confess to none of y'all misses
See I know how to control my Hennessy
I speak no ingles, play crazy like them Dominicans
See cause poppa was a rolling stone
He said, son get your gun, it's a war and it's on
So y'all go on and bob your head to the song
Throw up the 4's for the niggas, that's dead and gone

I'm tired of smokin 'bama-ass weed
Niggas out there sellin backyard boogies full o' stems and seeds
They whoopin the rocks and we compressin the coke
They makin it hard for them {?} to smoke
I went to jail tryin to get high; nigga told me
To go to hell went and called him, told him come get me out
So our father, who art in heaven
It must be the devil cause somethin wrong with these niggas
Nope - and crazy ain't the word
They say the stupid shit like Trick why don't you front a nigga a bird
Fo' what, so you can smoke it up?
Impress hoes, buy clothes, and make a nigga come fuck you up?
The game hard on a player
You coulda started with a block and now workin just for quarter fare
With all the cards I sold the hoes left me all by myself
And the game don't even care!

I usta hustle in the summer
No time for crime
I had to help my mama
And I love the rainy weather
Make me hustle better
Running into partner in na ghetto
Trying to get my shitt together
However, I'm giving these fuck niggas pillars
Robbing fake dope dealers and these fake ass killers
For my niggas
They keep they fingers on the triggers
Cause they heard about you business
And these fuck niggas trying to end this
So I'm ready, just riding dirty in the Chelli
Me and my cousin named Chopper and we stopping for that fetti
Call us foolish, cause of how we feel the way we do this
Slanging, robbing, and shooting
Even neighborhood polluted
I'm ready to do this and like weed
I'm always louted with duck tape ya muted
If the shit move, I shoot it
Hold on

I'm doing this one for my homies
Who left his baby mama lonely
Got chur-en dat neva saw him, got kids who don't even know him
Got to count his blessings sent
Cause one chance be his only lesson
For the homies all be missing, his son's got stronger missions
Hold on
Don't fall
Cause I've been there
And I know
Cause see all my niggas anit dope dealers

They call us thugs, so give us our own section in the club
Allow us to use our drugs

And ain't no telling when the boy getting back home
See everybody needs a hustle, to stay free from them bustas
Especially, when you getting in front of muscle
Cause them fools will try to touch ya
They know you dying for yours
So from day one, they don't trust ya
This whole style I be living for
Sometimes, look like I'm running fast speed
And this old bad luck taking me lower
Life's full of lies, theres too many guys
Who need to compete and God knowns a nigga tried
When it's gone get bettter, seems like never
In this life we live
Us niggas just can't stick together
However, I guess a change got to come from this
One day, but right now, I can't accomplish shitt
Patience for the frustration
Waiting to die for the troubles that I'm facing
So I'm living on the edge
I'm thugging til I'm dead, yeah
Standing free from them suckers and far away from them Feds
I say I never had no job, always rott
Living in the park, back when I was scared
And then things got better, my pockets got fatter
Went from to Jimbo, Timbo's, to Polo sweaters
Nigga came across a key and turned it into three
And got my fuck ass emenies running from me

Is this the end, I would stop breathing?

What time is it? What's the days date?
What brings the crowd, oh, why these long faces?
I'm getting kissed but why on my forehead?

Alotta things done changed since last year
Nope the crib and the same no more

Committin' sins, they know they get hanged for
But nigga God is straight, for as long as you keepin' it straight
Keep believin' in him and you'll be leavin' with him
So in Jesus' name I pray for better thangs
If you help me Lord my heart'll never change

Could've been Cuban, Columbian or Haitian
Could've been Japanese, Chinese or Guayanese
Could've been from overseas or the West Indies
Could've been anything but God made me black
Could've had anything but God gave me stacks
While he was givin' me that he said remember you're black
Whatever you spend on your momma I be gettin' it back
So as you see, a new watch and a Benz
And I'm still gettin' money wit my same old friends
Know this lady named Miss Pearl, my old girl
Raised all us, based all us
So, I'ma thank the Lord for her
Cuz you know where I'd be if it wadn't for her
I done learned a lotta things in this game, matter fact
Seen a lot of other other thangs that was strange
And there's a new game out called snitchin'
And it's obviously helped because these niggas keep tellin'
Lord please help me smell my thugs
So I can keep this in life, but free my niggas tonight

Survivin the Drought,Thugs Are Us,2001.0,"Last year was a great year, ask the click
But this year was scarred down to our last half of brick
Trying to survive in the drought wher it ain't no blow
It ain't no piece yo it ain't no dough
Yo 95 south sun roof moon light
Po-pos tight down before the turnpike
The last lick went sour feds jammed the blow
But like a weather man its a light chance of snow
Lay low at the bottom at the tell
Wait patient for my Haitian to hit me on the cell
Cause my Haitian cartell they always work
They even had shit when the Cubans were hurt
My Nigga hit back he ain't got no dope
He said the coast gaurd just knocked off the boat
He said the feds in Texas they out of control
Knocking off major bricks with the border patrol
A nigga couldn't rap long cause the phones they be wired up
I be god damned the whole east coast dried up
A nigga went from raw dope to cheap base
Ridind round with the block fed in the brief case
(chorus)
Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow
It ain't no piece yo it ain't no dough
It ain't no bricks no chips no food
So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
(repeat 2x)

In the drought I look the dope fiend right in the grill
Slang him a asprin or a vitamin pill
In the drought niggas panic when that money stop
Start slinging wamis and them dummy blocks
Hit the projects twurking in that 87 fleet drop
Set up shop with a 9 pack of sheet rock
Watcha a nigga get got
Now he wanna hit pop
He wanna brain wrestle he dont know I got my shit cocked
Cause in the drought you get stuck like a thumb tack
Dixie man got a 20 pack worth of come back
A player fucked up till that drought go down
A nigga got to spread his hustle when the drought come round
(Im stuck a player fucked up now im finna come back up)
Its back on with then pack playboy the blow flooded
The base heads happy and my workers show love it
M y dog hit the lick about two hundred birds
Off a Bahamian cruise ship that nigga got nerves
Now Cubans is beeping and the Haitians is calling
Im back to slanging Whole chickens popping cases and balling
I got to put the team on so Im looking them up
RJ he the chef He be cooking them up
While Im whipping em flipping breaking em down
With the straight razor chipping em
We got em harder than hard plus we pitching soft ball
Jumping for that how high this year gone cost yall
Since we the only niggas wit it
Its the lick of a life time
Coming up in the drought through the paroofeal pipe line
This time Im gone sit on me bout ten
Cause you never know when that drought coming again
Surviving in the drought, Surviving in the drought

Hallowed thy be thy name, thy kingdom come
All our G's would've been gone (would've been done)
If it wouldn't for thug holiday (ahh man)

In this life I live, I done see niggas deal
Seen niggas steal and done seen niggas kill
And them same niggas there, them be the main ones that tell
There's a lotta tension in the air, so nigga easy on them pills
I rather be the bitch that's squeezing than the nigga that's bleeding
See I'mma drink my liquor and I'mma smoke my weed
And I'mma stay far away from y'all buster motherfuckers
Y'all sucker motherfuckers, man fuck you motherfuckers
I'm being convicted of a thug living and drug dealing
Been a two time convicted felon ever since I was a lil' nigga
My first words was curse words, shit
The first bid I did I was just a lil' kid
And I was raised by pimps, hoes and mobsters
Taught the game by dope boys and robbers
I ran the steets with goons, I broke the rules with fools
I used to take my motherfucking tool to school

See I been thuggin all my life, trying to live right
You ain't even got ask
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs, what you know about that
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up)
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up)
You alread know (straight up), Straight up (straight up)

These feds crazy trying to take me down and book me
Throw me on death row and do me like Big Tookie
Got me running from them rookies and poppin at the seargent
Tried to tell not to push me now look what you done started
And you got these rap artists thats beefing on these songs
But I really will kill so I'm leaving that alone
I'm a grown ass man that ain't about playing
Ten G's will get you killed, family will die for twenty grand
Blow my nose with a Gucci rag smoking on a cuban
You damn right I know they mad, cuz half of em' losing
I slip a another clip into my A.K
Stay with Trick in M.I.A. when I come and get the yae
See the Chevy got a stash spot
I can fit a hundred in the back and just mash out
Hope I make it home, it they catch me then I'm gone
So we put it on the line
Everyday we on the grind gotta hustle til' you shine


My blood line is a level above the thug line
And according to the cat scan I ain't a ordinary man
See I run off oil and I breathe off chronic
I power up off money like a motherfucking bionic
I travel through time with a military mind
Strapped with a Russian A.K. and a German made nine
And don't mad at the rappers they ain't the one trying to attack us
It's slimy ass niggas and red neck ass crackers
Y'all better lower your weapons (lower your weapons)
Before my niggas get to steppin
Cuz shit can get real crazy if it was a thug invasion
Imagine a whole bunch of Cuban niggas and Haitians
Rebellion on your ass
For the shit you did to us in the past
See y'all ??? ????? and even arrested fiends
It took you fifteen years to close the ave
It's going to be twenty more before they close the ???????
Now where my motherfucking twenty one soldiers at
Now where my D Boy big gun toters at",https://genius.com/Trick-daddy-u-already-know-lyrics

Give me fifty dollar ??? I be coming in the hood
But you ain't got to worry 'bout catching no motherfucking headache
Under stress I be smoking on the good shit
No matter where I'm at, in a ride or at home in the studio writing
Hold ya breathe if you can't take it
Cause if ya with me and I got motherfucker I'm lightin'
Not trying to say I'm no hype
But after killing 'gars then I know I be tight
And I been smoking all motherfucking day
And I'm bout to smoking for the rest of the night
That's why my chest be hurting and I sleep so much

Just like that (Just like that)
Haha, my recipe for murda (murda)
Couple pounds of brown (Pounds of brown)
Couple DT's (Couple DT's)
Fo' or five of them big things they call choppas

See I was raised in the slums
But niggas tote guns distribute and run
Watch out on the one and one servin' the bomb
Niggas talk about Miami but they scared to come
Leavin' they family in danger just to play in the sun
Nigga, we did what you done and what you talkin' about
Like droppin' drugs up out of town and keepin' dope in the house
Ain't give my life to that 'cause it's over and out
That's how it is when you exposed in the south
See

All I need is big guns on the side of me
Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me (Hey, hey)
All I need is big guns on the side of me
Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me (Hey, hey)

The reenactment of my first murda
With no remorse and no feelings
Hell, cuz I ain't even know this nigga
The shit was deep I couldn't just let it go
While I was shootin' bout my money
Fruitin' bout my dough, bitch
I bust his ass like the last muthafucka
Went in with them stunnas, came out with them cuttas, cut up
You shoulda seen the muthafucka jumpin' thumpin'
Bullet after bullet pumpin' fully after fully
You muthafuckas went in bad choppas
I still got em, that nigga begged for his life but I still shot him
I let him know bitch, this is how I feel bout ya
I asked him out but now his momma bout to hear about him
I'm from the era of the goodfellas, you know
Nigga like Big Ike, Big Nose Bob and Bo Dilly
I growed up on the turf watchin' Murph and them
Murph dropped the top on the bird, that nigga was hurtin' them
I take this shit back to thirties and vogue
Let's see that's way before them Bama-ass hammers and loaves
That's in the days when the ave was jumpin'
Ev'ry nigga was gettin' money
Every corner was pumpin' and jumpin'
Huh, but now we in the new era
A new game a different thang and a whole buncha new killas
Money, money, money...
E'ery time, goddammit I'll say it e'ery time
Betta call us murderers

All I need is big guns on the side of me
Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me (Hey, hey)
All I need is big guns on the side of me
Bout a half a brick of yay and a pound of weed
Straight do or die bitches that'll die for me
How many niggas down to ride with me (Hey, hey)

The boy think he gettin' payed, jumpin' out
Squeezin' AK's, on the ground they lay
That's how we do this shit in Dade
Killer bee's, snappin' pictures plottin' killin' me
Them killed my dogg, hell naw it couldn't be
Gotta straighten this shit, got SK's with extra clips
Holla ""killer head"", and make them bitches flip the script
Cut it back to light, fake the left, rip the right
Them feel my eyes, these bitches down to die tonight
Pull right on the side, raise it up squeeze that thang
Went ""bang, bang"" till their muh'fuckin' brains hang
I live for this, so damn right I kill for this
And when I get that feelin', ain't gon' be no hit or miss

All I need is big guns on the side of me

Born A Thug,Back By Thug Demand,2006.0,"Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug
Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

This is a story bout a young nigga
Who's mama was a whore and his daddy was a drug dealer
Ridin' 'round the corner from 'em was the spot
They sold weed, lace, base, heroin and marijuana
His role model was an older nigga
Who kept a wad of hundreds cause he had a whole lot of money
Now keep in mind this is 'round the time that
Miami niggas was really tryin' to put it down
That's back when the pimp game played out
That next year crack cocaine came out
And it all started in the suburbs
But only rich folks could afford to go and smoke that good dope
And yo they used to call it free-base
But when it made it to my block, me and my boys called it Crack Rock
We used to cook it up and bag it up and sell 'em
Nickels and dimes to any bitch that was buyin'

Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug
Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

And when he first hit middle school
He was a typical, ordinary, everyday ass dude
Around the time eighth grade came around
He had done made up his mind, a nigga can't lay down now
His first job, he was a watch out
He had to scream one time every time the cops hit the block
We used to call him Bo Brown
Cause when he came around, close shop nigga, shut it down
Them lil' two-hundreds
That was a lot of money for a young nigga sittin' 'round not doin' nothin'
Plus his mama had a newborn from an old nigga out the hood
Who don't do shit for him
They go another bill, another mouth to feed
Oh well, yo a nigga couldn't stop there
He gotta keep food in his crib and keep the lights on
Ain't like his daddy's comin' back home
Now just imagine the role of a thirteen year old
Who playin' head of his household, now that shit's cold
But then again I suppose
You already know how the shit go

Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug
Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug

He advanced from watch out man to lieutenant
And now he got two feet waist deep in it
And he control the whole operation
But it's kinda different cause he's dealin' with some stiff competition
And everybody wants to be buddies
All of a sudden friends but then again all they see is money
And he ain't never too flashy wit it
Not into cars and jewels, just nice clothes and new shoes
Half of the money went straight to his mama
But the other half, you know, the kid had to keep it stashed
But it's kinda hard to hide drug money
But it's worse bein' a dope but none of this shit's worth dying for
But when it comes to livin', money's nothin'
Bein' dead is free now tell me, what would you rather be?
Don't tell me, tell it to your child
Make your talk worthwhile and the rest, he'll figure it out

Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be
But a thug
Shorty's gonna be
Shorty wanna be
So he's gonna be
A straight thug
His mama was a G
And daddy was a G
Ain't nothin' left for him to be

Half a pill, just a hit, it gets me high
Deuce-trey Escalade, that's my style
T-Double-D, thugging and raw, ride or die

I used to be a polo kid
Who would of thought of all the stupid shit that I did
I used to sport it talk about it
That's the reason why shorty went in the hood and bought it
Mr. Rabbit like a fast from the past
Bone jean overalls y'all can kiss my ass
Thug nigga going back to the basic
And that Iceberg on the curve is thug animated
But first off this is T double
When I hitya with them k cutters
You turn bout three colors
Gon and get your big brother I don't care
I'm dade county major slash player
Hold up 'cause Mr. Dollar got sold up
Time for war now be a boy what's the hold up
A new candiate for the thug of the year

We them niggas smoking coco and serious vision
(At the door) bouncers don't touch us
They know once ounces go up they hold up
And know what, I drink cris let it bubble back
I'm leaning on a double stack ready to snap
Trick already know yall ain't ready for us
We make a way in the club waving a slug
Come play with a thug, I can let y'all lay in the mud
I battle you partner aspotter that's hotter
With enough music to wake 'Pac up
Keep your Glocks up you can't stop us
True husltler chop doctors knot in pockets

Rain it Pours,Thug Holiday,2002.0,"(*talking*)
'Tis the season to be jolly
(Jolly, for what) hell if I know
I just don't get it, tell it like it is
It's on, truth hurts

It's like the sun in the summer
It's like the cold in the winter
And when it rains it pours
Y'all keep sweating these whores
I'm doing this one for the boys

This one here is dedicated for them hatas, I wrote it for my niggas
Who ain't here they couldn't make it, let's face it
The dope game is getting shaky
When shit get flaky, see most niggas can't take it
I done seen the biggest dope dealas turn squealas
And yesterday's killas, today's fucked niggas
?That's defined? on behalf of the state
Your main key witness, and won't involve me with em
You could set me up to crush time
It ain't selling the vines so nigga, lay down and do your time
Cause, back when you was kingpinning
I was sitting off in prison, and you ain't send me a penny
And closing arguments can't get me
I had it deep for the state, caught his first witness
That's right, that's right
From one heat to another, you a sucka


As an American, I think the whole world's against us
It took 9-11 just to convince us
That we got wars going on
And it's way bigger than thugs, this shit's deeper than drugs
Suicide bombings, and air attacks
All the planes that were hijacked, and all of our politics
So I guess that makes me a democrat
The Republican party problems are worrying about crack
If I could speak another language, I'd say it in
French, Spanish damn it, so everybody understand it
Want everybody on the planet, that if you anti-thug
I guess you gets no love, from us


Where are the police at when you really need em
How can you chastise a child, if you ain't allowed to beat him
Want to screaming for no reason
Why you keep reproducing if you know you can't feed em
If he leave you, don't blame him
He the father of two mugs so regardless, you ought to raise em
And it might seem outrageous
This unsafe sex these days quite dangerous
And stop killing these babies, I mean it, I love em
If you don't want em give em to me I'll raise em
Truth is, that the future is our kids, and every playa with skills
Should be in the NFL, for real

U Neva Know,Thug Matrimony: Married to the Streets,2004.0,"This one goin out to uhh, that nigga Bub (the game done changed)
Young Black Boy, Rick Growley, that nigga Wayne Parker (ha ha)
You know, all the niggas I know that was told on
Yesterday's, killers, today's fuck niggas huh?

My lifestyle's quite complicated
I'm an ex-drug dealer, corner sto' nigga, still mob affiliated
I'm disrespectful, ill-mannered and quite fiesty
That's why fuck niggas and slap bitches never did like me
But Lord, if you're listenin, please God forgive me
If I end up doin one of these niggas out to ruin me and kill me
But the devil leaves me only a few choices
I gotta kill him or he'll kill me, y'all niggas don't hear me
See y'all got choppers that's splittin when these niggas
Go to {?} sippin and set trippin like (FUCK NIGGAZ LISTEN!!)
I'm just doin my thug thizzle, and I ain't fuckin with a nigga
So why they fuckin with a nigga huh?
I guess it's part of the strip, where you step out of line
Get flipped out the lip, fuckin 'round get killed
So let them niggas know I'll never forget 'em
Through the rain sleet or snow, I'll always remember yo

You never know, you never know
You never know, you never never know
You never know, you never know that
Know that.. (know that..)

And even though my, childhood was low budget, shit
Some of the shit I couldn't have, I wouldn'ta have
If the niggas wouldn'ta took it
I wanted things my momma couldn't afford
And that's crazy, cause as a little shorty
It made me even want it more
But now the police got the spot hot
Doin an undercover drug ring, sellin X pills and cocaine
And some sets up a reverse thang; what makes it worse
Is that them jerks lost they spine against my own team
I heard how bad them boys really want me
But most likely, they gon' indict me, for keepin it real homey
After all, I done exposed a few of they rats
And done told on a few cats to get a few years up off they back
And all the shit that I can tell 'em, tell 'em
Two times convicted felon so, ain't much I can sell 'em
Plus I'm a slug and my third strike's my whole life
I know the money's lovely but hell I'll hold tight cause


(One murder comin right up)
Who got beef for the Daddy Dollars
And wearin wires around they collars
Yo, y'all fuck niggas I'll stop ya
And I declare war on any pussy boy
And tell his momma his son a whore
Him give dem crackers what dey lookin for
See the Boogie Man's got a backup plan
And I'll, back up sprayin, so y'all don't act up man
I was just a law-abidin citizen
And I never been a shit started, but I been well known to finish it
See, and you can fuck around, and have a whole truck
Of young stupid muh'fuckers, 'cept that now they lookin for ya
And all they need is a minute in the clear
Where all the witnesses in they ass done be worth a whole life chance
So y'all keep playin all the crackin, den throwin bricks at 'em
The next bitch they catch, bet they ass sendin matches

I'm on the edge but I can't let go
Is this the end, I would stop breathing?

Hold up wait, take these covers off my damn face
Looking like it's gonna be a long day
What time is it? What's the days date?
What brings the crowd, oh, why these long faces?
I'm getting kissed but why on my forehead?
Pretty flowers, don't tell me that a nigga dead fuck

You wanted beef wit the thugs, but the club wasn't big enough
All the G's to the V.I.P
Hoes follow along right after me
It's - SNS in this bitch
Matter fact, I be the best in this shit
Put me on your next remix
Now count the spins that you get (Uh-huh)
See shit get crazy dogg
I'm takin' this shit way back to the eighties y'all

Straight Up (feat. Young Buck),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Young Buck)

Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed thy be thy name, thy kingdom come
All our G's would've been gone (would've been done)
If it wouldn't for thug holiday (ahh man)

In this life I live, I done see niggas deal
Seen niggas steal and done seen niggas kill
And them same niggas there, them be the main ones that tell
There's a lotta tension in the air, so nigga easy on them pills
I rather be the bitch that's squeezing than the nigga that's bleeding
See I'ma drink my liquor and I'ma smoke my weed
And I'ma stay far away from y'all buster motherfuckers
Y'all sucker motherfuckers, man fuck you motherfuckers
I'm being convicted of a thug living and drug dealing
Been a two time convicted felon ever since I was a lil' nigga
My first words was curse words, shit, the first bid I did I was just a lil' kid
And I was raised by pimps, hoes and mobsters
Taught the game by dope boys and robbers
I ran the steets with goons, I broke the rules with fools
I used to take my motherfucking tool to school

See I been thuggin all my life, trying to live right, you ain't even got ask
I got that Hen in my cup, smoke in my lungs, what you know about that
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up)
You already know (straight up), You already know (straight up)
You alread know (straight up), Straight up (straight up)

These feds crazy trying to take me down and book me
Throw me on death row and do me like Big Tookie
Got me running from them rookies and poppin at the seargent
Tried to tell not to push me now look what you done started
And you got these rap artists thats beefing on these songs
But I really will kill so I'm leaving that alone
I'm a grown ass man that ain't about playing
Ten G's will get you killed, family will die for twenty grand
Blow my nose with a Gucci rag smoking on a cuban
You damn right I know they mad, cuz half of em' losing
I slip a another clip into my A.K
Stay with Trick in M.I.A. when I come and get the yae
See the Chevy got a stash spot
I can fit a hundred in the back and just mash out
Hope I make it home, it they catch me then I'm gone
So we put it on the line
Everyday we on the grind gotta hustle til' you shine


My blood line is a level above the thug line
And according to the cat scan I ain't a ordinary man
See I run off oil and I breathe off chronic
I power up off money like a motherfucking bionic
I travel through time with a military mind
Strapped with a Russian A.K. and a German made nine
And don't mad at the  they ain't the one trying to attack us
It's slimy ass niggas and red neck ass crackers
Y'all better lower your weapons (lower your weapons)
Before my niggas get to steppin
Cuz shit can get real crazy if it was a thug invasion
Imagine a whole bunch of Cuban niggas and Haitians
Rebellion on your ass
For the shit you did to us in the past
See y'all  and even arrested fiends
It took you fifteen years to close the ave
It's going to be twenty more before they close the ?
Now where my motherfucking twenty one soldiers at
Now where my D Boy big gun toters at",https://genius.com/Trick-daddy-straight-up-feat-young-buck-lyrics

Gotta Let You Have It,"Book of Thugs: Chapter A.K., Verse 47",2000.0,"Now I gotta let you have it
Rappin' fire from my automatic
Now I gotta let you have it
Rappin' fire from my automatic

I just might have to toss this nine
Across your mind
Across that line
I'm running straight up in your mammy's house by mine
Puttin' this fire up in this old bitch mouth by mine
And openin' fire
And I ain't swearing no niggas
Give the deed up until four niggas
Ain't sympathizing with you hoe niggas
I'm just realizing what this thug shit for nigga
You in the middle of a war nigga
Now I gotta let you have it
The whole clip
Fucking up the whole trip
Now you fucking with the boogie man
This shit deeper than Nino Brown
And I ain't see no clown
Nigga nigga nigga

Now I gotta let you have it
Rappin' fire from my automatic
Now I gotta let you have it
Rappin' fire from my automatic

I got some niggas that'll bump with you
Play with your kids and eat lunch with you
Then fuck around and kill your ass
I close shop
With 2 shots from a far away Glock
Then leave you dead to rot
In a empty lot
And this thug shit simply not
To be taken light
Well y'all fake less I'm taken life
Then I'm taking off
To the old hood
To check on a old girl
To make sure it's still all good
Then it's back to the streets
To finish this beef
Looking for them same niggas that's looking for me
And about three blocks
From where they set up shop
Sell weed and lay some rocks
They got these old cops
Working they're spots
And young niggas on the roof with red dots
When me and my clique scrap and we scared not

Now I gotta let you have it
Rappin' fire from my automatic

I'm paranoid cause I'm hearing things
Time served
Only out a few months, associated with birds
They want to pop it, I got bad nerves
Peep
Mini-14 on the front seat
You want to be there for your kids, nigga play with it
His Grams missing, who did it, I'ma deal with it
So fuck I care about the shorty
Cause nigga you been known
Skip town
With my pound
With my dudes 'round
Now nigga how you playin', I done counted that
You wanted work, all you had to do is fucking ask
My cuban friend
Want his ends
Instead of you flipping them divedends
Making millions
Popping then
Silly rabbit
You done started static
Now I gotta let you have it
Rapping fire from my automatic
You left me stuck
And so you outta luck
Cause you done fucked my credit up
ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST
Nigga what

Now I gotta let you have it

Everyday me and my dog we wylin

And we ain't trippin' on nothin', just vibin'
Big 9 with me cause a f**k nigga tried me
They already know, how I let him go
Kill his ass and make sho' at his funeral
How the hell a O.B. gon' try me?
I'm O.G. on and off TV, see
Middle fingers in the air, tell 'em f**k yall
Tryin to hate on my dawgs, hell f**k nah
Why you hatin on a nigga like that
Why you tryin' to stab a nigga in his back
I know some niggas don't like this
But them niggas is the reason I'm like this
F**k niggas done made me mad
I'm 'bout to snap 'n' put this K on his ass

Hey

Trunk popped up lookin like a Tonka Toy
If you dont like it you know can get that Almond Joy (What?)
Deez nuts nigga, wuddup Trick, I got ya boy

Ridin' wit my trunk popped up like I'm ""Above The Law""
Tires wet and nigga they still drippin' Armor-All
Tell me you gon' fall, and I ain't got to use the arm at all
Bet Daddy finna Trick 'em, finna flip the paper
Chamillinator, me and Trick we finna shred a hater
Tip the dinner waiter Trick 'em like we finna date her
Get off ya sleeves let 'em breathe like a ventilator
Hey, what can I say me and the King Of M.I.A
Finna, (Hey) finna touch ya niggas and ya finna pay
Stay wit it hey you we ain't finna play
Snatch ya off the wheels and you can watch ya rims spin away

Look in his mouf he got so many gold
(Im sippin and I'm goin'
Whole click, that's how we rollin')
Stay fly, stay right if ya didn't know
(And that's everywhere that we go)
All I wanna do is
Drive my Chevy through years
And let 'em sweat the candy paint
Ain't it right?, ain't it tight?, ain't it nice?, yes
Niggas like, ""Who painted that?""
Candy apple green, lookin mean anywhere
Tweety seat with the digital dash
And a swat just right in the ass
{They wanna know what I got in here
I got shit when it hit betta run 'em up outta here}
They ain't neva heard nuthin like that
And they ain't even turned the bass up yet
{I love aggressive music
I smoke, I listen to it}
I drank so much, sometimes I think I need to quit but I can't do it

Im riding hard in the donk/
Lookin big in the donk/
Gotta get it in my donk/
Steady grillin in my donk/
Im riding with my top down/(Top Down)/
Im just trying to put my mack down/
And Im just flossin in my heavy chevy/
X2
(Verse 1)
I feel like an old Seven tray impala/
Wit no doors and no windows/
Wit no oil/no g*d dam**d water/
Been riding around for over 200, 000 miles/
With no tags/no insurance/
On some old bald head a** tires/
My alignment off/timing off/
S**t lookin real bad/
Cuz Im down to my last quarter tank of gas/
Good thing the weathers in fair condition/
Cuz where Im from/
All year long n****s need air condition/
But I ain't got none cuz my compressor gone/
And I keep hearing a tick tick tick ticker sound/
I think one of my heads is blown/
They say for 1500 I can get it rebuilt/
But I ain't got a dime/
Im going through some hard times/
I ain't lyin/
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
You know s**t get rough/
Every year around the same time/
The longer you wait/the longer its gonna take for you to calm it down/
And its gon take more than a check for X to pimp my ride/
Ima need me a new blockbuster deal/
For a n***a to live/
Its gon take shady 4, 5 maybe 6 mil/
I done did 6 albums n***a/
This s***s real/
And now you trippin/
Cuz my transmission ain't slippin/
I ain't getting no younger/
Im damn near 50/
Ive been ticketed and towed/
And broke down on the side of the road/
Steering column been broke up/
But never been sold/
So this time Ima need me some insurance/
I need me some medical/and dental/and some gangsta a** instrumentals/
So I can get this s**t all chromed out/
Painted candy apple green/
The wettest s**t a n***a ever seen/
If daddy dollars can't do it/
G*d dam**t it must can't be done/
And I must be a motherf****n pearl shine/
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Ain't nothing like and ol full tank of gas/
Ain't nothing like being waxed and washed/
Then being valet parked/
And I got rid of that old bad cough/
Got me a new cam and exhaust/
A n***a pushing 500 horses/
And thats without the spray/
Get out my way/
Get out your car/
This green thing/
Is a motherf****n superstar/
The American Idol of the Chevy game/
Trick Daddy Dollars/
Don Dada/
A f****n donk rider/

Jump on the top wit a drop that nigga down in the dirt
The first nigga quick to get it first
Call the paramedics 'cause the police be stealing from the herse
I aim it at ya hat when I burst
If I don't get a grammy I'm headed at the rat niggas first
And I'm back full of perk strap on the curb
Slap that bitch on the third
Nigga done caught wit a slurr
Can't see shit but a blurr
Crank up that Chevey let her purr

Bitch niggas runnin up nerve

Bitch I'm a mutha f**kin jacka man
And Understand when the mutha f**kin crack is stayin
(Trick Daddy)
Yall mutha f**kers better run 'cause we got bombs
Plus we got guns that take off arms
Got 4,4 that shoot the do' and got buck loads of that 84
And like John Doe, hit ya city start killing every nigga who ain't feelin' this rhyme

Yo' daddy yo dog and yo hoe

Bout four, five slugs and we was bustin' they ass
Gotta keep my bread in a safe place
We up with my hitchens in undisclosed locations
Hey yo I got the llello, you got the money

Every ounce betta bounce back
And every brick that I break up

And when that shit hit the waters
Shit go to ballin'

I bought coke back on 84
Back when wood used to get them bricks from the Birdo
And when I hit him I want to hurt him
And on cutlass I wanna hit it

Well let me get to my hustle (hustle)

Bricked up and breakin' em down

You learn to swell you might see double
Remember you can't sell bubble
So here it is fool
I play the game where its no rules
Givin' you lessons from the old school
You don't get high off your own supply
And when a motherfucker cross you make sure he die
Make the next man know he got to think about the payback

But I ain't even notice his arm
But his diamonds cloudy
And he ain't shiny
And I heard his shit ""Tick Tick Tickin'""
Oh man, this nigga trippin!
See we poppin' bottles and smokin bugga
Actin' cocky
Big thangs with fat pockets
Wearing seventy-thousand dollar watches

Shakin', bakin'and breakin' it down

Hoes slob on our johnson
Cause johnson got that best powder

Survivin’ the Drought (feat. Duece Poppi),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Last year was a great year, ask the click
But this year was scarred to our last half of brick
Trying to survive in the drought where it ain't no blow
It ain't no  so with ain't no dough
Yo 95 south sun roof moonlight
Po-pos tight down before the turnpike
The last lick went sour Fed's jammed the blow
But like a weather man it's a light chance of snow
Lay low at the bottom at the tell
Wait patient for my Haitian to hit me on the cell
'Cause my Haitian cartel they always work
They even had shit when the Cubans were hurt
My nigga hit back he ain't got no coke
He said the coast guard just knocked off the boat
He said them Fed's in Texas they out of control
Knocking off major bricks with the border patrol
A nigga couldn't rap long 'cause the phones they be wired up
I be goddamned the whole East coast dried up
A nigga went from raw dope to cheap base
Ridin' 'round with the block Fed in the brief case
Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow
It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough
It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food
So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow
It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough
It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food
So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
In the drought I look the dope fiend right in the grill
Slang him a Asprin or a vitamin pill
In the drought niggas panic when that money stop
Start slinging wamis and them dummy blocks
Hit the projects twurking in that 87 fleet drop
Set up shop with a 9 pack of sheet rock
Watcha a nigga get hot, now he wanna hit pop
He wanna brain wrestle he don't know I got my shit cocked
'Cause in the drought you get stuck like a thumb tack
Dixie man got a 20 pack worth of come back
A player fucked up till that drought go down
A nigga got to spread his hustle when the drought come 'round
I'm stuck a player fucked up now I'm finna come back up
It's back on with then pack playboy the blow flooded
The base heads happy and my workers show love it
My dog hit the lick about two hundred birds
Off a Bahamian cruise ship that nigga got nerves
Now Cubans is beeping and the Haitians is calling
I'm back to slanging whole chickens popping cases and balling
I got to put the team on so I'm looking them up
RJ he the chef, he be cooking them up, hookin' them up
While I'm whipping 'em, flipping breaking 'em down
With the straight razor chipping 'em
We got 'em harder than hard plus we pitching soft ball
Jumping for that how high this year gone cost y'all
Since we the only niggas wit it
It's the lick of a life time
Coming up in the drought through the paroofeal pipe line
This time I'm gone sit on me 'bout ten
'Cause you never know when that drought coming again
Surviving in the drought, surviving in the drought
Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow
It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough
It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food
So tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
Surviving in the drought where it ain't no blow
It ain't no piece, yo it ain't no dough
It ain't no bricks, no chips, no food

Look at this shit I'm facing
And now these streets don't get no better for my young niggas
Now the muthaf**kers that's coming up is the gravediggers
And I can't seem to trust my niggas
And I grew up with 'em
Folk in my mind at times learn not to f**k with 'em
When I was stuck who could I turn to?
Nobody but jesus
I'm in this world looking up to the gangster's
Looking up to the leaders
Granddaddy had a stroke and grandmomma broke
Who the f**k gone feed us?
Y'all wrapped us in ropes and put us on boats
But y'all really ain't need us
Muthaf**k that shit
I got tired of the struggling
? ? ? in the jungle
Can't let a nigga f**k me about this coke
So I learned what was and what wasn't
I'm getting them things at 17
At least gone cop a dozen
You lose yo life
Shit ain't no joke
That's if yo coke is buzzing
Shit
Hook: 4x
Look I been scuffling years your honor
That's why I'm traffickin' these bricks and marijuana
Shit
Mystic(talking)
Now what I'm talking bout
Got niggas doing the dirty dirty
Now what I'm saying
But it can't last dirty to long
Nigga gotta clean up somewhere
So, you know what I'm talking bout
Take a nigga advice and get in and get out baby boy
Cause it ain't all bad
But it ain't all good
Now what I'm talking bout
And the hood dangerous watching out
Everybody shouldn't be po-po
Dealing with the dope dope
So you better watch out boy
Get in and get ouuuut
Hook: 2x
Look I been scuffling years your honor
That's why I'm traffickin' these bricks and marijuana

Have My Cheese (feat. J.V. & Money Mark),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(J.V.)
The game done switched
Niggas who was po' got rich
Niggas who was real turned snitched
Ain't that a bitch?
That's why I get mine on the low
Hustle 'til a nigga can't ball no mo'
Fall to the flo'
Cause the shit don't stop
Shit get real right here, Money Mark
J to the Dot
I make shit hot
I don't even really wanna hear what you got
Just sign me right when I come for my cheese
Ain't too many niggas down like these
Stand right there while I count my B's
If anything missin' get a hole in your knees
Freeze
I might talk low but I don't stutter
Hot ones go right through like butter
If you feel like a big dog, bite don't ball
Hell, you can get it too if I pull your card
(Trick Daddy)
Nigga don't be f**kin' wit' my cheese
You know I'm 'bout my B's
You better have my cheese
'Cause I go crazy
(repeat)
(Money Mark)
I keep flow plus hoes on the side of me
Plus I'm playin' these noodles like ivory
I make 'em ride for me
Tounge kiss 'em make 'em die for me
I get their cheddar then I'm outtie, see
I'm fien to seen all means for the dough
Chop a nigga down if my greens don't grow
Y'all know about flow
So niggas stop puttin' up a front
And give a muthaf**ka what he want
'Fo you end up in the trunk of the dunk witcha hoe
Layin' on my hot ass amps like ""oh""
Nigga think it's a game
Remember Money sparks the name
And it ain't no thang to do a nigga 'bout change
See I love money man
If cane involved then nigga you a lost cause
Shit, I'll hit you with my razor blade
Cut off your balls
Sit you in some alcohol
(Aaaah!) Oh Lord!
(Trick Daddy)
Nigga don't be f**kin' wit' my cheese
You know I'm 'bout my B's
You better have my cheese
'Cause I go crazy
(repeat)
(J.V.)
I gotta get me fa sho the whole 9
So when the sun hit me they say ""whoa now""
""He done blowed now""
""J.V. outta control now""
And if they didn't bet they know now
And I don't floss but you gotta know it cost
Don't like the boats but you know I'm goin' off
You know who the boss
Who gon' win and who lost
And when it's by J.V. you know I want it all, hmm
Is they in love with the dubs or the lex?
Or do they know I'm just as good as it gets?
You wanna go next?
If so we can hit it
Long as you know J.V. out to get it
'Cause when it's 'bout my cheese - I'ma clown for mine
If it's B's or it's G's - I gets down for mine
Bust rounds for mine
Put you face in the ground for mine
I'ma hound for mine
Hell bound for mine

Nigga don't be f**kin' wit' my cheese
You know I'm 'bout my B's
You better have my cheese

Paradise,UnKnown,2017.0,"Flight 305 to Miami is now boarding
Slip-N-Slide collabo
I will always be the one to
Dade County
Bring you back, bring you back

Fool's
 (Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's
 (Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice

Well alright, it seem like broke days was the better days
When your whole neighborhood was HUD housing and Section 8
I was just in the seventh grade
When I made up my mind, my dream car was a seven tre
Wanted a donk, I was still at the bus stop
That was around the time Trick Thugs R Us dropped
305 on the baseball cap
Used to peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat
Realest killers on the block still jookin' and stickin'
And everybody used to rock Reeboks with Dickies
And my aunties was getting loose to Uncle Luke
My uncle them was selling dope and smoking boonk
That was way before the mollies came through
And way way after Hurricane Andrew
And way before the flakka fiends and skinny jeans
That real Miami life, it was paradise

Fool's
 (Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's 
(Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice

Reporting live from Liberty City
We in the heart of Miami, the nitty and gritty
See, I was raised in a different time
By some strong women with they own mind and they own grind
See my mama was a hustler
Taught me how to stack that money and make it double up
Picture me with my bamboo earrings
With my girls at the block party on Fifteenth
Wrist full of bangles, me and my girls
Rockin' ocean waves and leisure curls
FILAs, K Swiss with the ruffle socks
Way back then before they knocked down Scotts
Before the dope boys started riding on fours
It was trues and vogues, fifties and lows, and
I been driving dudes insane
Dade County, home of the baddest bitch in the game

Fool's
 (Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's
 (Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice

Let's take it back
We used to come through with the top down
Take the whole backseat out and watch the bitch beat out
My backyard was a reefer hole
Any thots wearing lil shorts, we called them skeezer hoes
Every Friday we was in the hay-hay
From 1 to 5 on Saturdays it was Kitty day
And we was Pac Jam junkies then
If you wasn't for them one of them beans you wasn't getting in
All them niggas off of Fifteenth Avenue
They was eating like them boys off of Malibu
And 2 Live was our niggas with attitude (NWA)
M&M boots, silk shirts, and Bally shoes
The Splash Down or the Goombay
Parade on six-two for Martin Luther King Day
And Overtown used to come alive
We used to give straight up fades before we did drive-bys

Fool's
 (Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
Fool's 
(Miami), 
paradise
You better think twice
'Cause it's not very nice
