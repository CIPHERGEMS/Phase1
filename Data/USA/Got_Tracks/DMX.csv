Where the Hood At?,Grand Champ,2003.0,"Ayo, y'all niggas must be out your fuckin' mind
Thinkin' dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat
Nigga, I ain't gotta check out my motherfuckin' sleeves
You bitch-ass niggas, fuck is y'all niggas
Y'all niggas just thinkin' I'm sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, y'all niggas can't be serious

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
D to the M to the X
Last I heard, y'all niggas was havin' sex with the same sex
I show no love to homo thugs
Empty out, reload and throw mo' slugs
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand
I don't fuck with chumps
For those who been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree
Man, I give y'all niggas the bidness for fuckin' with me
Is you crazy?!

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats
'Cause I know niggas is hard-headed but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin' no patience turn into more patients
More trips to ICU 'cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (Right here!)
See them niggas? (Right where?!)
Get 'em boy! (Right there!)
That's how we do (Alright then!)
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at, baby?! (Creepin' through the fog)
From then till now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon' roll like them niggas
And hit every block on the job

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

I get tapes doin' times, stomp niggas like grapes makin' wine
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin'
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face
Lookin' at you in your grill, I might be nice to cut
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt
Yeah, you right, I know your style: pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly
Never heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'
I beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas actin' up?! Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that

Where the fuckin' hood at?!
No one's fuckin' with me, nigga, for real
I am the hood, I am the streets
You bitch-ass nigga!
Take it how you want, motherfucker
I’m in the hood all day
I think I’m like the only nigga, dog, that can go to the projects
(School Street, Home of the Brave)
By his fuckin' self and be good
Yeah, nigga, ask niggas on my projects (Y.O.)
When the last time they seen dog (Not too long ago, baby)

Party Up (Up In Here)- Album Version (Explicit),...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

If I gotsta bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick
Aight, all your mans up in the jail before sucked my dick
And all them other cats you run with
Get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit?
Aight, there go the gun click, 911 shit
All over some dumb shit; ain't that some shit?
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club
‘Cause every time you come around, it's like what?
I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
But I'm not him, aight, Slim? So watch what you do!
Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue
Or maybe they just saying that now ‘cause they miss you
Shit, a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you laying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

Off the chain, I leave niggas soft in the brain
‘Cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fucking with me; and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on
That got you think that you Superman, I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You're wack, you're twisted, your girl's a ho
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?
I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go.""
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whining over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on, on the strength of the hands with them, man

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it hurts the head
No more talking, put him in the dirt instead
You keep walking, lest you tryin' to end up red
‘Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
‘Cause you's a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga, push like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen! Your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? Some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

One, two, meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my Ruff Ryders gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my big ballers gon' meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside
All my fly ladies gon' meet me outside

What these bitches want from a nigga?
What these bitches want from a nigga?

Ayo, dawg, I meet bitches, discrete bitches
Street bitches, slash, Cocoa Puff sweet bitches
Make you wanna eat bitches, but not me
Y'all niggas eat off the plate all you want, but not D
I fucks with these hoes from a distance
The instant they start to catch feelings
I start to stealin' they shit
Then I'm out just like a thief in the night
I sink my teeth in to bite
You thinkin' life, I'm thinkin more like, ""Whassup tonight?""
Come on, Ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight
I'm not gon' jeopardize my life
So what is it you want from a nigga?
I gave you, you gave me
Bitch, I blazed you, you blazed me
Nothin' more, nothin' less
But you at my door willing to confess
That it's the best you ever tested
Better than all the rest, I'm like, ""Aight, girlfriend, hold up
I gave you what you gave me, boo, a nut!""

What these bitches want from a nigga?
What you want? (What you want?)
What these bitches want from a nigga?

Ayo, I think about when a nigga didn't have
And a nigga told a joke, and the bitches didn't laugh
See, now I do the math, I see if you got this
And this and this to some cats, that nigga's the shit
And that's all they fuckin' with
But see these bitches don't know
If these bitches ain't for real, these bitches don't go
Knock on door, no show, I'm asleep, tryin' to creep
With yo' best friend, put it in, dig deep

X, let me talk to 'em for a minute
Oh, I know, I know it's so hard to be
A victim of my reality
Heard you callin' me names, said I was trife
One thing you gotta know, I'ma be a nigga for life

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is
New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew
Don't know what we're goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some mo' niggas
That's runnin' with yo niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight?
Then you haven't met the apes

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby—mind your business, lady!
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down
Watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny?
Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean
Come up off that green, rob niggas on ravine
Don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
Ayo I'ma slave till my home is a grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit?
With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? BOOM! Not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that .44
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me
Bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Gotta make them groove, got 'em all like ""Ooh!""
So to the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

5411, size 7 in girls
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls
Girlfriend, remember me (what?) from way back?
I'm the same cat with the wave cap
That motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them
Doin' they thing on 35th? Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up
Aight? Hit you on the jack later on, see whassup

Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'

Try to creep me (what?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kids daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy

Slippin’,"Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood",1998.0,"This life shit, this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out, son, for real
See, to live is to suffer
But to survive…
Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering

Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

I've been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma
Be that seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinkin' about how short I was
Goin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
When I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin' high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast

Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks
Catchin' Vicks, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick
Used to get high, just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'
Three years later showin' signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up

Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin' shit, was like, ""Damn, look how that rock got him!""
Open like a window, no more indo
Look at a video, sayin' to myself: ""That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV,"" believe me, it could be done
Somethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due

Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

See, this is that shit, this is that shit
That all real niggas can relate to
This is from the heart, baby
Don't get it twisted

Hmm, that's what I've been wantin' all my life
Thinkin' about my little man so I call my wife
Well, your dada is about to make it happen
(What you mean, my nigga?) I'm about to make it rappin'
Today I met this cat, he said his name was Damien
He thinks that we're a lot alike and wants to be my friend

You sure? I coulda swore it was over a ho?
Nah, nah, that ain't my style. 
Nigga, you stay frontin'
But you're still my man, and I ain't gonna say nothin'
Got some weed? Go 'head, smoke it! Go 'head, drink it!
Go 'head and fuck shorty! You know I can keep a secret

I'm about to have you drivin', probably a Benz
But we gotta stay friends: blood out, blood in
Sounds good to me, fuck it, what I got to lose?
Hmm, nothin' I can think of, any nigga would choose
Got me pushin' the whips, takin' trips across seas
Pockets stay laced, nigga, I floss G's
For that nigga I would bleed, give him my right hand

What? Anything for you, dog, where them niggas at?

Run up on 'em strapped, bust off caps in four niggas
Laid low for 'bout a month then killed two more niggas

Let Me Fly,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"If you love somethin', let it go
If it comes back to you it's yours
If it doesn't, it never was
Hold me down, baby

Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want to play with me when to show me how
No meow, 'cause it's all about the bark
Let the dog loose, baby, it's about to spark
Light up the night like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
With this Y and you don't know, you slow
Like Baltimore, if you ain't tryin' to go you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence, 'cause the wildest
Is the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog, what y'all niggas see is the bat
Flappin' away, but I'm blind like Stevie
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop bein' greedy, you heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow, or I'm dead

Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

I sold my soul to the Devil, and the price was cheap
And yo, it's cold on his level, 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb – shall I go on?
Yo, on the real, what the deal? It's a mystery
How is it I can live and make history?
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born with it, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be held
Locked down in a cell where a soul can't dwell
This is hell, go get the Devil and give me the key
But it can't be worse than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between doin' wrong and bein' wrong
And that ain't right, just keep it fair, baby
Put me in the air and I'll take it there, baby – yes!

Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

I'ma flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me dap, but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road where you were told
That you would go when you were old and if you died young it was cold
Sold, not for nearly what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like, ""What if his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed?""
Have I given somethin' that if taken away you'd have missed it?
Didn't know, yet I persisted, it was the call of the wild
I merely say what's in my heart and you call it a style
Don't put it in a cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge? Here it is, eat it!
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing, I got it locked with this rap shit

Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

Or give me death
Or take my breath
I'ma die anyway
But I'll be gone any day
Or give me death
Or take my breath
I'ma die anyway
But I'll be gone any day

Interviewer: But I heard these niggas is supposed to be like, locking down the industry on some shit, on some power shit
DMX: Dog, that's my mans and them

Uh-oh, what have you done now?
Told y'all niggas
You just don't listen
Why must you be hard-headed?
Tried to explain, but you didn't hear me, though
You know
Grrrrrr!

One-two, one-two, come through run through
Gun who? Oh, you don't know what the gun do?
Some do, those that know are real quiet
When you think you wanna try it, fuck around and start a riot
Niggas gonna buy it, regardless
Because I'm the hardest rap artist and I'mma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel
My words, I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duct tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 9-1-1 call
Niggas stay beefing, but a lot of them bluff
But not me because I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them's tough? That's just a front
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?'; the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing them down
We all knew that you was pussy, but I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, because raw blood will have a dog like what
Biting whatever, all up in your gut
Give it to them raw like that, and ain't no love, I do 'em all like that
Four right up in they back; clack-clack
Close your eyes baby, it's over, forget it
Happened in front off your building, but nobody knows who did it (What?)

Howling at the moon on the roof (Uh-oh)
Eh, ah, no, get em
10 niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Tried to strike back, left him like that, laying up with the white hat
Getting right back atchya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothing but bones and ashes
Hittin' niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stays red
Girls gave me head for free cause they see
Who I'ma be, by like 2003
That Nigga D took it there,
 he thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that I was broke
Stupid, that's what you get for thinking
And eventually found that's what you get for stinking
Blowing up the spot when you rot
Plus, if it gets hot, they know you dead for four squared blocks
Hit 'em with the ox to the grill
Eh, ah, kill, nigga, kill!

Lord Give Me a Sign,Year of the Dog... Again,2006.0,"Yeah
Uhh
In the name of Jesus, spread the word
""No weapon formed against me shall prosper and every turn that rise against my judgment, thou shall condemn""
(Lord give me a sign)
For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
""And their righteousness is of me,"" said the Lord
Amen, Lord, give me a sign!

I really need talk to you, Lord
Since the last time we talked the walk has been hard
Now I know you haven't left me, but I feel like I'm alone
I'm a big boy now, but I'm still not grown
And I'm still going through it, pain and the hurt
Soaking up trouble like rain in the dirt
And I know only I can stop the rain with just the mention of my savior's name, in the name of Jesus
Devil, I rebuke you, for what I go through
Been trying to make me do what I used to
But all that stops right here
As long as the Lord's in my life I will have no fear
I will know no pain from the light to the dark
I will show no shame, spit it right from the heart
Cause it's right from the start, you held me down
And ain't nothing they can tell me now. Lord, give me a sign!

Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you
Cause I'ma go through whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!

Please, show me somethin'
I'm tired of talking to him, knowing he frontin'
Crying about, ""Life ain't nothin"", but you either be the one mad cause you trapped or the one huntin'
Trapped in your own mind, waiting on the Lord
Or hunting with the word that cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than the strongest man
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand
Through the trials and tribulations, you never let us down
Jesus, I know you're here with us now
Jesus, I know you're still with us now
Keep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how
Let me take your hand, guide me
I'll walk slow, but stay right beside me
Devil's trying to find me
Hide me! Hold up, I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back
Lord, give me a sign

Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you
Cause I'ma go through whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!

Life or death, live or die
I will never live a lie
I'm going there because I try
I won't give in till I die
I'm gon' make it, wrong or right
Make it through the darkest night
When the morning comes you'll see
All I have is God in me
Lord give me a sign!
Please
Lord give me a sign!
Lord give me a sign!

Let me know what's on your mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind. Lord, give me a sign!
Show me what I gotsta do to bring me closer to you
Cause I'ma go through whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do. Lord, give me a sign!",https://genius.com/Dmx-lord-give-me-a-sign-lyrics
I Don’t Dance,Undisputed,2012.0,"Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, New York
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggas duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggas run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggas whisper, ""X is a crackhead""
Aight fuck it, I'mma just crack heads
I bang niggas that cross the line
Y'all niggas talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't
Y'all niggas walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care

I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the wall
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

Kells get it crackin', y'all play chess
Kells gets to scrappin' and y'all just flex
Why is y'all rappin, when I got next
You roll with them and I'll rock with X
Eastside motherfucka, Cleveland Brown
Burning leaves in the gutta, make it Cleveland loud

Hop up like the sand man right behind ya
Like where the cheese bitch fuck lasagna
Pair of shoes size bags, loot stuffed inside 'em
Grimey, bare hand, no tool beside me
I don't talk online, hater come here find me
Me against the world, underdogs new Rocky
Givin a fuck if anyone co-sign me likes that uh!

I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet

Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick
I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggas for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog, and you not

I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat

Niggaz Done Started Something,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with hoes up in skyscrapers
In condiminiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole committee like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through
I got niggas who PUMP on yo' block and in your spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, fronting, fronting in eclipsesis

Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We taking knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The Rikers, Sing Sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas' names on it
Often I bug, then bust off on a thug
Have a chump coughing blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a TEC at Mason, have a explanation
You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sipping margaritas with a mami
Cleaning my Tommy, showing love to my army
Whenever The Lox find rippy blocks, we kill 'em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel 'em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissing us
My 16's be so real
You can feel 'em in your vein
Like Ramello's pops from Sugar Hill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spitting clips at your face
We started from the bottom, you'll see beg niggas' pardon
Whatever, we can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real, B
I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty

I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official LOX family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you're smartest, and retaliate the hardest
Regardless, if you're a thug or a rap artist
Respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffinG Nestle
And y'all niggas done starting something
Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'ma make salat 'til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start busting off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started something
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started something

Don't came at me with no bullshit, use caution
'Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion and racketeering
Got niggas fearing, fuck whatchu heard, this what you hearing
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so give me 3 feet
'Cause when we creep, no more than 3 deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on your toe
Now who gon' tell your mother, her baby's under a cover
In the morgue, stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hardheaded nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got what you came for
(What's that?) Surgery with the chainsaw
I hit the fucking streets
'Cause, like I said before, ain't nothing going down until I eat
Muh'fuckers think it's all about impressing bitches and stressing bitches
Well, I'm testing bitches game, undressing bitches, and caressing bitches
And dealing with muh'fuckers on all level, what I'm dealing with is all devils
Fucking with snakes running with niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas and scary niggas get it all the time
'Cause what they got is all of mine, your man was talking shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck witchu
And gave it the money, 'cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest then I tossed the nine
Boss of crime, black Gotti, I stack bodies with the black shottie
Bitch-ass niggas who act snotty
Get it

These niggas is for real
These niggas ain't playing
This ain't no fucking game
You think we playing?

You still right here shorty, told you I got you
Like the way I scooped you when them faggot niggas shot you
I'mma hold you down and I mean that for real
But every time you beef with a nigga, I end up havin' to kill
It ain't like that, and hey, forget about them two kids
'Bout to get a deal and it's as nice as you is
Oh, you think? — Nah, I'm just playin', wassup?
Got some new bitches, I know you tryna fuck
Not really — What, I ain't your man no more?
Just because a nigga don't need a hand no more?
You know how we do, if one goes soft
We all take the pussy and go up in her raw
It's like now, where you goin', I ain't tryin to take it
Fuckin' with a nigga like you, I won't make it
It'll be what it is... — Yo, you in for the night?
I'm 'bout to take it to the crib — You get home, aight?

Yo, I ain't fuckin' with this nigga no more, word to my mother
Fuck it, so you know I'm for sure, word to my brother
It's like he's gotten worse than before, son of ""I wonder""
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under?
Then I get the call: ""Yo?"" — ""X!
Police just killed your cousin, underneath the projects
Don't get vexed, niggas'll pay, 'member I got you
Told you I got you; Dawg, I got you!""
I'm in a catch twenty-two, but them niggas got to pay
But I know he gon' be askin' for a favor one day
But fuck it, I ain't got no choice in the matter
Them faggots killed my peoples, and I wanna see 'em splatter
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, we ain't on no kid shit
And I'mma use the same gun that you killed them two kids with
Is that hard to live with? — Nah — See, you still a playa
But what you want from me? — Ahh, I'll tell you later

The snake (snake), the rat (rat), the cat and the dog
How you gonna live when you're in the fog?
The snake (snake), the rat (rat), the cat and the dog
How you gonna live when you're in the fog?

Shit is all over the news: 'Bomb goes off in Central'
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?
The mental is like, ""Get the fuck outta there!""
I'm out — Hey, goin' somewhere?
Nah — What's the bag for? — Fuck it, what you want?
Can your nigga come inside, for a minute and puff a blunt?
Here we go again... — After what I just gave you?
Wasn't actin' like that, when you asked for that favor
Yo, I ain't asked you for shit! — Oh, yes you did!
When you really needed somethin' then you allowed me to give
You sold me your soul when you didn't say no
Just let a nigga go; now gimme what you owe!
Fuck were you thinkin'? Ain't shit for free!
Ain't a motherfucker you know can defeat me!
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned
And with your help, I know the Devil won't win!

Who's afraid of the dark?
Responsible for the murders in the park
When I bark, they hear the boom, but you see the spark
And I see the part of your head which used to be your face
Be replaced by nothin' for bluffin', what a waste
Niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine, picture that
Get on some old second grade shit, I'ma get you back
Retaliate, if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off, yeah, you heard me, shook it off
Man, if we was up north, niggas would've been fucked you
But then we in the streets, niggas should've been stucked you
Plucked you like a chicken wit' your head cut off
They'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cut off
And as for your man, don't you ever in your mothafuckin' life
Know when I gotta gun come at me wit' a knife, a'ight?
And forgettin' you ever saw me is the best thing to do
Don't give a fuck about your family, they'll be resting with you

Will, have that same nigga like you, gun in your mouth
But won't be like the last time when you run in the house
'Cause I ain't knockin' on the door, I'm comin' in the house
And I'm gunnin' for your spouse, tryin' to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older than 15, I'ma rape her
Take her on the livin' room floor, right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously, whatchu wanna do?
Frustratin', isn't it? Wanna kill me, but I'ma kill you
Now watch me fuck just a little while longer, please, will you?
This is revenge, know that before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
I'ma make you suffer, see your ass in Hell, motherfucker
Click, boom-boom, see your ass in hell

And I'm hittin' 'em with shit that they can't all swallow
I keep my slugs hollow, keep families with sorrow
Keep motherfuckers like you, not seein' tomorrow
I will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you
Let you slip up, just once, then I'ma wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
'Cause where I catch you is where I catch you, that's what killin' means
Fuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'
'Cause once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start runnin'
Niggas started somethin', but they chose not to finish it
So I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, 'cause I'ma win this shit
Fuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques
And I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax
Gimme slugs for my gats, gimme hoods for my rats
Gimme wood for my bats, then they meet where the fuck I'm at, for real

Yo, yo, y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog!)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog!)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me, dog!)
(Rrrrrr, arf arf! What the deal?)

Nowadays, it ain't looking too good for certain niggas, I'm hurting niggas
(What you doing?) Robbing niggas, jerking niggas, sticking niggas
Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered
They know he died slow cause they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams, but I'm not really chasing mine
I soak it all up like a sitting fly
'Cause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high
I live to die, that's where I'm headed
Let your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it

Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog!)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog!)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me, dog!)
(Rrrrrr, arf arf! What the deal?)

One in the back with ya faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathing, but you dead from the waist-down
The fuck is on your mind? Talking that shit that you be talking
And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you, yo, Baltimore shit (Ah-oh!)
Nah'mean? I'm just robbing to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street
When we're starving, we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York
Transforming-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo, for real, that nigga K can suck my dick!
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
'Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie
AHHH! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like: ""Protected by Viper, stand back""
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this coward? Finish him, it's ended! (*Explosion*)",https://genius.com/Dmx-get-at-me-dog-lyrics

Jadakiss
]
Jay!
Fuck that
This is it, right here, baby!
You know what it is

Yo, I used to have bad luck; now, you might see me in a Jag truck
Mad stuck, either with a dime or a bad duck
Double-R tee with the matching bandanna
.38-snub, blue steel with no hammer
And I see y'all niggas tryna glance at the 'Kiss
'Cause I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Boning your women, drunk off Coronas and lemon
And you know I'm still writing the mean, lighting the green
I need the bucket, even though I look, right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggas throw us on they album, try to boost they sales
We put our pies on the table and our eyes on a label
'Cause them rednecks up in the mountains'll try to slay you
They call me raspy, tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me, you probably don't want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower, so I'm able to skip
Usually a good nigga, even though I'm able to flip
You pay thirty for the 'Kiss (Uh-huh), a hundred for The LOX (Yeah)
And if we cool, then I write a hook for a drop
Whatever's in the bank is my bet, a Z-bull's my pet
And you can bet he'll get the legs and the neck

Uh-huh, yeah, aiyyo
Yo, when my gun bust, send niggas to the fish like Swanson
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson, I put fear in y'all heads
Sheek Louch, type of nigga gasoline y'all beds
And that's warning, if you all alive in the morning, that's fine
Now, I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine
I want PC, see me? Tuck in your chains
I got niggas my pops' age that lifestyle ain't changed
It's like, wake up, move a brick, half of it slow
Make car money, check with Sheek, go fuck with a ho (Ha!)
I rock a waist-length mink, do-rag under my fitted (Style on these niggas!)
And I don't even want waves, Timbs be halfway new (Huh?)
That's Sheek in the dress-up club cause I don't fuck with shoes
And for my nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told
I put thirty in your head, all in the same hole
'Cause we got the same goal, and you try and tamper with mine?
Don't make me motherfuckin' leave you with some shit in your spine
Fuck with me, you be a ""was nigga"": ""Nigga WAS dope""
""Nigga WAS gettin money"" 'fore I extorted your coke
'Ju crazy? Haha

Aiyyo, catch me with a .38, box of shells
In a '98 Lincoln, eating pasta shells
Order to go, always got a box of Ls
Blow, stay on the low, get a Heine' and swig
I'm Pinero,
 
so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig
I pop shit 'cause I'm the second-best; the first was B.I.G
Y'all niggas is sonned out, let me speak to your father
'Cause I like to play chess and I swing the revolver
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga going legit
You hold your nine if you holding a brick, common sense
Fed drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent
L-O-X get respect like Sonny from 
Bronx Tale
Us and DMX: the Ruff Ryder cartel
Thirsty to live—oh, y'all niggas eager to die?
I tell all my niggas ride, you won't leave with a dime
Motherfucker!

Yeah, yeah, I'm a monster
I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, putting up Will Smith numbers (Ugh)
Surrounded by Sixes and Hummers, bitches among us
Trying not to let this bullshit become us
It started from hunger, 'til it all went insane
Now, bitches notice the chains now that I hit my number
The chickens I twisted (Ugh) see the digits unlisted (Yeah)
The beeper done changed
You dead, bitch; the Reaper done came
I suggest niggas stop speaking my name
'Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain
I keep creeping, streets keep watching, I keep popping
Niggas is hotheads and the bullets is heat-seeking
Jay flow for pesos; chase hoes, not!
I just circle 'round the block in a drop
Tell 'em jump through the top (Uh-huh)
Where the sunroof used to be
I can see y'all not used to me
Nigga, flows like none other (Ugh!)
I'm the meanest, toughest Don Dada to gun-butt ya
You the type that bust a lot of shots, and none touch you (Fuck)
I'm the type that get excited, when the gun touch you
Motherfuckers! Ugh
Y'all niggas bout to witness a dynasty like no other
Uh-huh-uh-huh-uh

Uh-huh-uh-huh uh, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
I'm headed nowhere fast (Ugh), running in place, gat in my waist
Niggas wanted a taste, but wouldn't come to my face (Ugh)
So what that mean? You cats is playin' games again
So now what I do? Start naming names again (What!)
All you motherfuckers know that I speak from the heart (Ugh!)
Play like you don't know, L-O-X is gon' bark
We can take it there, but to make it fair, get some more niggas
Styles, Sheek, Jay... We comin' with like four niggas (Aight?)
Y'all niggas best to stop playin'
It'll be the ones you forgotten about
That'll get you shot in your mouth
ARF! ARF! Got my dogs covered (Ugh!)
Plus it's all gravy, like chicken when it's smothered (What!)
It's Dark,

Look Thru My Eyes,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"I seen your eyes all fucked up...

Judge not, less you be judged first
My nigga, my nigga

Look through my eyes, see what, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Burnin' in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me, and they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, (arf) when you see that spark it'll kill
Peep how I park it and chill, take it over there, walk wit' it
From Y.O. to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', up 1-2-9
Up the School Street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, ""Get at me, nigga!""
""Arf! Arf! Arf! Get at me, nigga!""
What the deal is? Never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say ""X is the best,"" know he still is
Can't help but feel this, puttin' goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
It's the calm before the storm
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's gettin' warm, feel me yo

Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya
With the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play racks and raise stacks
Payback's a bitch; didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you'll get mud
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold, but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time sold an eighth, then told it's not an eighth
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fuckin' with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate chose to give me the weight
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelin's put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him, so I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street
Look through my eyes and see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes and hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy

I Can Feel It,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"Sometimes
Sometimes you just know
You just know, that's all

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin' under
And you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on yo' ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up, you see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas'll put a slug through you, over your ends
Cats I fucked with are real, but hey, those are your friends
It's just what you got comin', sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, yet you ask for more
Shut the casket door, this one here good as done
They thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah, it's gettin' closer

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that and hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
It takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The Devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go
I can feel the Lord pullin', but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin', but we all do the losin'
It's just who does the choosin', is you goin' up or down?
What have you been provin'? Just that you were a fuckin' clown
Been seen the bullshit but never spoke on it
‘Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I was traded the chance of bein' a child with a father
For a talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night – come on!

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

There's a lot of shit that I let slide, ‘cause it's outta my hands
Lot of niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
That a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue
Full moon, (ah-oo) – the howlin'
(Grr) – the growlin', (shh) – the prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need mo' love than an old thug
But hold up, roll up, talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know why you died in your house
While they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide
But you and I both knew, the truth'll never die
Listen, nigga, if you scared, get a dog
But be prepared for the mob
‘Cause you dead up in the fog
And that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when it's there
This is hell and we're both here, can you feel it? Tell me yeah!

I can feel it coming
In the air tonight, hold on
I've been waiting
For this moment for all my life

I thank you, Lord, for my birth and everything that's followed
I thank you, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank you, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now... Lord, this is your house
I thank you, Lord, for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go
So I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see
And I thank You for the love that they've given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray... no, we pray... together
Get us through the bad weather, and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live, bear with me

Lord, You left me stranded and I don't know why
Told me to live my life, now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me You would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'
Sometimes I think all You do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special, that's what You told me
Hold me, stop actin' like You don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent You away from me?
Not only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?
""My child I'm here as I've always been
It is you who went away and now are back again
What did I say?""
 Follow Your word and be true

""Just because you went away, my doors are not locked
Wanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock""
You see, I left home a boy but returned as a man
Full grown and I'm still not able to stand
""I gave you a hand.""
 Well but I was lookin' the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here, over there
Back to over here, now it got me like where
Do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?
""Thou shalt not steal.""
 But what if he stole from me?
""Thou shalt not kill.""
 But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
""Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain""

I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be

 To love my life until I die

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill, I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
4-4, that's what I get sick with (Grrrrrrr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grrrrrr)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, just give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else is black

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their health
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
When the sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy

I Miss You,The Great Depression,2001.0,"I know that my savior lives
And at the end, He will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed
Yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see Him for myself
And I long for that moment

Grandma, I really miss you, and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I hear your name
Mary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't – it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you
Why couldn't I come when He came to get you?
Damn, I really miss you… I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like 10
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed
You told me I would get it – you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me
I thought, how bad could this hurt be?
I know now, that's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma

Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'ma let you know what's been goin' on lately
Now you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed
Yeah, Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renée's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's(?) doing real good now, she workin'
Rhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin'
Buckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin' fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father... well, that's somethin' else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin' a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
Once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring

Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

You left behind a mother, eleven kids, eleven grand-kids
And since then, two of your grand-kids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother
That's right, Xavier's made you a great-grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her acceptin' and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the Bible
I thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace…) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
'Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
'Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life, like everything, comes to an end
I pray I go to Heaven to see you again – Amen

Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see, yeah",https://genius.com/Dmx-i-miss-you-lyrics
Damien III,The Great Depression,2001.0,"Hey yo, D! It's your nigga D!
What the fuck, you forgot about me?
You've been eatin' real good lately
Didn't get a shout out on your last album, what, you hate me?
Said I was your dog
Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Said I was your mans and them
And any problem that you had I would handle them
Ayo, dog, it's like this, I fuck with you lightly
‘Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep you'd bite me
Get mad at me, send niggas wantin' to fight me
Whole time you fucked with me you didn't like me
Dog, where you hear that? Pssh, niggas talk
Plus you know how shit flow in New York:
Walls have ears, buildings heard
Supposed to be shhhhhh, but spill the word

Everywhere that I go, everything that I see
Every place that I touch, I feel him fuckin' with me
I'm gonna fly…
Why you lie?
Told me it was Ryde or Die
I'm gonna fly…
Eye for an eye
What happened to my piece of the pie?

Now, dog, you know me better than that
I could put you ahead of the pack instead of the back
I could have niggas sellin' tapes instead of the crack
Could have niggas fallin' down with lead in they back
Ain't much that I can't do when I want to
I don't really need you; nigga, fuck you!
WHAT?!
Nah, I'm just playin'; got a wife and kids?
Good thing they ain't come across them triflin' kids...
Yo, what you mean by that? Mean by what?
You'se a grimy nigga f'real, I see what's up!
I don't even know why I fucked with you from the door!
‘Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more
I could've got it from Him! But you would've had to wait!
But I wouldn't have the weight! C'mon, don't hate!
What happened to the right hand, Light Man?
Nah, that's Dark Man! Well, let's get it right then!


Now I see you for who you are, it's like I know you
So I can't trust you as far as I can throw you!
Oh you don't know, you are the reason
That I go through what I go through? Let me show you!
Didn't I promise you a Benz, lots of friends,
Countless pairs of Timbs, these endless ends?
Yeah, but what did it cost me?
My life to be taken softly; man, back the fuck up off me!
Don't fuck with me like that when I fuck with you like this
Don't come at me like that when you know that you might miss!
Go on about your business!
If any cat you send my way, ain't gon' be no witness!
LORD JESUS C'mon, dog, look who you're fuckin'
PLEASE HELP ME Whassup, dog? Man, you buggin'
KEEP THE DEVIL Thug life, thought we was tight
OUT OF MY LIFE! I'll be back, aight? Psych!

Here We Go Again,...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"Same old shit dog, just a different day
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
IT IS NOT, A FUCKING GAME!
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
If it's fuck me nigga, you know it's fuck you

I kick it to shorty to try to help him understand
Hit him with work, cause yo, that's my little man
He asked a few questions bout the game and I told him
So when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him
Never told him nuttin wrong, kept it fair
Didn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin to the air (damn)
Everybody makes mistakes, a mistake is aight
But if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight
Nobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship
But shorty's fuckin up big time, I HATE THIS SHIT
I'm caught in the middle of, havin love for a lil nigga
Knowin what's expected of me as a, real nigga
My next move is crucial, what do I do?
How do I keep it real with shorty in my crew?
Didn't want to kill him, so instead of puttin the Mac on him
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him

Here we go again..
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again..
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again..
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do

So if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you

Niggas that I fuck wit, wanna get him dead
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man
But I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand
Go about your business (uh-huh) do what you gonna do
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through
I can forgive I just can't forget
You're on your own little man don't ask me for shit
If you paid attention to what I taught you then you good
If I see you again, get it, understood?
Go 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead
""I just wanted to say, ""Aight, go ahead""
Instinct told me to kill him but the savior is
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor
But I also knew, the decision I just made
Went against the rules of the game that we played

Here we go again..
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again..
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again..
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again..
So if it's fuck me nigga, then you know it's fuck you

I should have, followed my first instinct, cause I knew
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do
Now this nigga's fucking with the competition
Ungrateful motherfucker, should of got him missing
This nigga got the nerve, to take my kindness, for a weakness
Gotsta get back on some street shit so I can creep this
Rat, when I act, take one, set him up, to take two
Get him there, take three, get him done
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him
BZZZZZZZT, CLICK! There was a bullet in one of them
Feelin lucky? CLICK, looks like you are
CLICK CLICK CLICK, luck ain't goin too far
What you did was put on another pair of shoes
And they just happened to be too big
What you did was stupid, real fuckin stupid
Well shorty I gave you a chance and what did you do?
Threw it back in my fucking face so fuck you too!

Here we go again..
Same old shit dog, just a different day
Here we go again..
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play

Prayer,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"I come to you hungry and tired, you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak, you give me strength and that's deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie, 'til I die
Lord, why is it that I go through so much pain?
All I saw was black, all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you ask for this story
I put it together to do our dogs some good
Our dogs bein' brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid
And I remember once you held me close, but I slid
There was somethin' that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same
Matter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change
And it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door
But I've never known a love like this before
It's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain
And up under the ceilin' I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real, so I wipe away the tears; it's on
And I almost lost faith when you took my man
Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long
So, if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die, but, please, Lord—treat him right",https://genius.com/Dmx-prayer-lyrics
No Sunshine,Simmz Beatz Presents - The Best Of DMX,2001.0,"It's dark, and hell is hot

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, cause when it's on
Ya niggas know to be gone, everytime, cause we don't play

""Who turned out the lights?"" is what niggas be sayin
Now you don't wanna fight, but y'all niggas be playin
Thinkin it's alright, keep playin with that role
And you gonna know the night, when you layin in that hole
Dirt gettin tossed in yo' grave, now it's all over
Preacher said ""You was brave,"" but now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty, I done gave it to
(*boom*) Ain't no savin you
No matter how many tears your moms' cried
Ain't gon bring yo' ass back, plus in hell you gon' fry
Why? But now the only two relative questions
Is ""Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?""
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention your name they knockin on wood
Did I, get my, point across?
Another body on the shottie
 another joint I toss

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, cause when it's on
Ya niggas know to be gone, everytime, cause we don't play
Everytime, cause we don't play..
Everytime, cause we don't play..

It ain't no sunshine when the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine, so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's, so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine, cause I'd like to hear some shouts
Get at me dog, niggas know how its goin dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man, of the unknown
(GRRR, ARF!) One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin home? Looks like you
You hear strike one, talkin shit, strike two
Won't be a strike three, cause I don't play fair
I'mma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like - yeah, holdin you up cuz you fallin (WHAT?)
The Lord ain't comin, 'til niggas stop callin
You was ballin, a minute ago, in it for dough
'til it was, ""Yo, I swear to God, I didn't know""

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, cause when it's on
Ya niggas know to be gone, everytime, cause we don't play
Everytime, cause we don't play..
Everytime, cause we don't play..

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Whatchu think you gon' get, fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One (one) two (two) three, here I go!
Your shit is quick, and your shit is slick, but this shit is thick
Ain't you hear this shit? Damn right, I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, I'll do it 360 and come up from behind
Tap you on your shoulder, have you turnin around
Hit you with somethin that'll have you burnin the ground
Be like, ""Damn, ain't nuttin left of money, but a pile of ash""
Life is good, so please enjoy it while it lasts
Cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends on the stronger the flow
And niggas know, I don't give a FUCK, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on

Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, cause when it's on

Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know
So to me it ain't nothing but being true
But..
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
It doesn't have to be the way it is
You say it is
Just because for the past 20 years
Everyday it is (WhAt?)

Only I can stop the rain

Without worrying about coming to conflict with the law

If I follow him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the words that you can see

But everyday shit catches up with you
And when it does you can't say shit

What I won't, you still
What makes us feel like we gots to kill
When

Only I can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose
How many more times must we choose
To trust these fools
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
I gave it to you straight, don't mix it
Twist it (what) up for some slick shit

I don't have to walk to it anymore
I'm out the door (what)
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the lord
I don't wanna find the peace with the sword
I can't afford to
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
When everyday of my life
Is just a constant fight
Between wrong and right
Now I know
Only I can stop the rain
I thank you lord for my life
I thank you lord for keeping it loose when things got tight

Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain

Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin' feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, 'cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know, fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve 'em like salt
Lock it up like a vault whenever wreck is caught

Lookin' over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
And extort shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz

Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin' stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit?
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit!
'Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't wi't sellin' crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him wit' a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the GWB

'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done

But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm goin' to Hell, 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin' life I been the Devil's advocate

The Convo,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"You tell me that there's love here, but to me it's blatant
That with all the blood here, I'm dealin' with Satan
Plus with all the hatin', it's hard to keep peace (uh huh)
Thou shall not steal, but I will to eat
I tried doin' good, but good's not too good for me
Misunderstood, why you chose the hood for me?
Me? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it
Went to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it
So now here I am, confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose or is this just a lesson?
And who is gon' choose when it gets turned around?
And will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?
My child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there
Even at those times you least suspected it, I was there
And look at what I've given you - a talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call, but I'm always on time

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end?

But when the funds are low, the guns'll blow
Lookin' for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough
No! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme
You'll get it all in due time, you'll do fine, just have faith 'cause you mine
And when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold
So don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold
See that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there
Two sets of footprints; I was right beside you there
But what about them times I only saw one?
Those were the times when I was under the gun — It was then I carried you my son
Led you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)
Ayo, a few of them times I thought you would erase me
When all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse
And the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith
No more runnin' or slidin' in the dirt, 'cause I'm safe

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
Lord we're just startin'
But where will it end?
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?

So if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan?
Never had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted
And if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it
Looked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things
Kept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings
And now you mean to tell me that after all this time
It was you that kept the dog from goin' out of my mind?
It was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?
And it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?
And it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?
And it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?
And it's been you speakin' to me inside my mind?
And it's been you who has forgiven time after time?
It was you who opened my eyes so I could see?
And it was you that shined your light on me?",https://genius.com/Dmx-the-convo-lyrics

Was a quite brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came direct (uh), when he came, gained respect
So I gave respect, (uh) we shared the same respect
To name regret, in our own circles
Two brothers with good hearts, but if you start
Two brothers that'll hurt you (yeah)
Know how that dirt do, Hittin four corners

Held dog down, didn't let a day go by
Everytime dog came the the chi
I was good, trips out to Phoenix, with the scrambler squad
Now I come back to Phoenix and like ""damn it's hard""
To accept the fact, that you won't be coming back
But I hope you coming back, 'cosI won't accept the fact
When you came to New York, you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa
, (yeah!), thats just how we did
Remote control cars, (WHAT!), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase our day! (yeah!)
So I'm not gonna say goodbye my nigga
Instead I would rather
Focus on the time we spent together, that's what matters

Need you to save me a spot, next to you and the lord (aight)
Don't know when I'm coming, but keep checking the door (aight)
But while I'm here, knock on wood
I'll make sure that your kids remember who their father was
And Val is good, (aight!) understood how real niggas move
We don't talk, but ya gonna always have family in New York
Believe that (yeah!), where you at, you can see that
We dogs for life and to death and I mean that!

Angel,...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"What good is it for a man to gain the world
Yet lose his own soul in the process?
God loves you, yes he does, said you're alright with him
I wonder…

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help
See, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself
Behavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it
But every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it
Losin' friends day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there won't be a his or hers, just ours
Then you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years
Do the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers
I will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against
Everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
That's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before
'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war
Between good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you
If you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

My Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead
Take what's in my heart and put it in my head
See, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you
My life is yours, my soul I gave you
I don't know if I'll do good enough (
He's by your side
)
And we both know the hood is rough (
Right by your side
)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (
X, dry your eyes!
)
But I know what I gotta do (
It'll be alright
)
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example—if I can do it, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him (The light with him)
You're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him

He's by your side
Right by your side
X, dry your eyes!
'Cause it'll be alright
Yeah, he's by your side
Right by your side

It’s All Good,"Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood",1998.0,"Love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
Love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?

It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

Yo, chickens is good for pluckin', so I'm stickin' bitches, fuckin'
Got 'em trickin' while they suckin', give em dick and they be buggin'
I've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way
Dominican hoes on B-way
, country hoes in V-A
And they all say the same about my game it's tight
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight
Over some dick that they don't even own
All I'm givin' them is the bone
Blowin' up a niggas phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)
I'm in the zone, tryna do things
Let's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game?
Don't wonder why when I leave at night
It's because I thieve at night
I'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right
I fuck they head up with some slick shit
Hit 'em off with some long dick shit
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday
Knowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first date

It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

Flocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins
Got 'em doin' shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do
Like knowin' I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to
Still gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (what?)
Pictures of bitches and flicks of chicks
Videos with the baddest hoes, suckin' dick
It's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong
And honeys can't help but get strung (why?)
'Cause the game is too strong (okay)
I like 'em greedy, black like Edi
Eyes beady, willin' to give to the needy
I done ran through 'em all, from around the way bitches
To them outta state hoes, and even hittin' gay bitches
All I tell 'em is, ""Let me get that,"" then it's on
Knock her motherfuckin' boots, and then I'm gone
I got the white bitches sayin', ""It's a black thing!""
'Cause I leave that ho with no dough and plenty of back pain

It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

Bitches who get props, 'cause they know who can get got
And they can get shot, by the way a niggas lip drop
Walk up in the spot, knowin' what she want strictly
When hon wants the dickly, hon comes and gets me
Hits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy
Knows to be Swayze, 'cause that's daddy's baby
I keep them hoes in check, like the government
Hittin' 'em off with nothin' but the dick, and they lovin' it!
Huggin' it, like it's they best friend, 'cause it is
Word to Miz, fuckin' with tricks is just biz
I deal with strictly dimes
Got 'em committin' they first crimes
Now she suckin' dick, for the first time
And ain't no secret, 'bout how I freak it, when they sleep
Didn't never know how I peeped it, then creeped it
That's how I know this must be that shit
I tell them bitches, ""I'll be back,"" and they believe that shit!

It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night

Shot Down,Grand Champ,2003.0,"Over and over I done told ya, boy
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, boy
And when you gon' get it in your brain?
The gate's wide open and the dogs off the chain

I be that youngin with that gun that’s tellin' ya stop frontin'
I be that yougin on the run after I pop somethin'
In the Bible I read death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Jay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy
If you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say ''Sak pase Nap boule'' and rob niggas
The media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's with that?
See my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers
X, what up? (Aight)

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Getting in our line'll get you shot down
We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bullshit you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

Fuck y'all niggas talkin' 'bout, think you playin' with?
Double R, G-Unit, the same old shit
Put the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit
All y'all niggas is pussy, suck my dick
Ain't nothin' but a handful of man still standin'
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was ""Slammin""
Now we meet again, it's all good, my nigga
Back to the street again, it's all hood, my nigga
Knock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'mma make you remember where you know my name from
45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave
I done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Getting in our line'll get you shot down
We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bullshit you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

If your head ain't off of your shoulders
You ain't get shot, you got nipped nigga (just nipped)
Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
It's gon' do more than chip, nigga (a lot more than that)
Yeah, what the fuck is the problem?
The Porsche is red, the buckets is army
30 shot handguns, the gutter is starvin
Niggas like me might rush your apartment
Bloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
I don’t want the throne or the crown, I ain’t sell enough
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough
I'm the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his
And niggas is gettin shot down, two guns up
Double R, S.P., holdin' D Block down

You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down

Fuckin’ wit’ D,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

What's on y'all niggas minds? Fuckin' wit' me
Y'all know somebody has told you about fuckin' wit' D
Stuck in a tree is what you will be like a cat
Another dog at the bottom looking up, now what's that?
Your worst nightmare 'cause I take it right there
You got niggas coming? Where they at? Right where?
I make 'em like air, floating away
Wouldn't tell what he was thinking so I opened a way
Left him broken away, you know he hurt before he died
Makes you wonder if he lost his shirt before he died
Only two knew the answer and one of us is dead
So anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to head
Then you and him can discuss what I did
Yeah, it was wrong, dog, but I slid
I'll repent one day, just not right now
You hear my shit all on the street, I'm kinda hot right now
Come on!

I don't give a fuck about
Y'all niggas cause y'all ain't killing nothing (What?!)
I don't give a fuck about
Y'all niggas cause y'all ain't killing nothing (What?!)

I wanna break bread wit' the cats that I starve with
Wanna hit the malls with the same dogs I rob with
Wanna be able to laugh with the niggas that I cried with
When it's over be like these is the niggas that I died with
What do you do when you find out, in the hall, there's a rat?
What do you do when you find out that your dog is a cat?
Shit, all niggas pack, can't hold but two
So while you getting more gats I'm putting holes in you
A snubnose will do, break 'em off real propa'
Nina to keep spittin' and I ain't gonna stop her
Cock her, unlock her, let 'em go!
Give it to his man, just to let him know
All things considered, it was real for a minute
Got what was yours and tried to steal something with it
Now feel something hit it, your chest that is
The best that is, is possibly the best that slid
Don't stress that, kid!

I don't give a fuck about
Y'all niggas cause y'all ain't killing nothing (What?!)
I don't give a fuck about
Y'all niggas cause y'all ain't killing nothing (What?!)

When niggas hear that dog bark, they better run
When police hear that dog bark, they better come
They expect to save their lives, but they lives will be lost
There is a price to pay, how many lives will it cost? (Come on!)
Since I run with the devil, I am one with the devil
And I stay doing dirt, so I'ma come with the shovel
Is you on a level of a madman whose mind's twisted?
Mad niggas dreams caught the last train, mine's missed it
Listed as a manic-depressive with extreme paranoia
Hey dog, I got something for ya
Hear my name, feel my pain
Niggas wanna steal my fame, but first, feel my reign
Know what it's like to suffer, never have enough of
Shit, starting off hard then only getting rougher!
Tougher, but then came the grease
So if you wanna save the peace, tame the beast!",https://genius.com/Dmx-fuckin-wit-d-lyrics

So to me (so to me)
This is life (this is life)

One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

I'm up at like 6AM to check this nigga
He work the nightshift and I gots to check them figures
Knock on his door, peoples talkin' 'bout, ""He ain't there.""
But the house is packed, shit I know he here somewhere
See, money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by
Just make sure you gettin' by don't fuck with you gettin' mine
Ain't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then
Hate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin'
Won't be an ass-whippin, I can tell you that
I keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs
And run off (damn) tell me he was locked down up North
And you out a week later? That's bullshit! I bust off
I need this dough—fuck you think, I'm here for my health?
I need this wealth because I feed myself
You play with my life when you play with my money
Playin' round but this'll be the last time you think somethin's funny

Yo, I've been casin' the liquor store for a month now
But me and two other niggas
Is about to run up in there and shut it down
I got four people on the inside, one stay in the back
Two stock boys, one at the register but he count the stacks
Aight bitch, put on the ski mask!
Make sure that when we ask
For the dough they know that we takin' all three bags
Now see that? We got a hero, shoot that nigga!
Matter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga
Hard-head motherfuckas always get it
I told him what would happen if he moved
That nigga moved so I did it
""Did you get it?"" I asked my man as he was comin' from the back
Nigga opened his mouth, said nothin' and fell out flat
This cat come out spittin', hittin' my mans, his mans
Couldn't control what was in his hands
I'm hit, damn! I bust back and got the fuck up outta there
Didn't get a dime, but at least I got up outta there

One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

Ayo I see it, try to avoid it, but it comes
That's how it's goin' in the slums over crumbs
Somethin' little becomes somethin' major
Niggas gettin' blown up like a pager, ear to ear with the razor
Pour out my soul, took control of hurt
Why must Earl Simmons swim in dirt?
I'm gon' make it work, 28 and tryna get baptized
Priest scared to touch me 'cause he said I gave him bad vibes
Ride when I die, straight down but I'm plottin'
We all gots to go, but who wants to be forgotten?
I'ma leave a mark and it won't be the mark of the devil
Throw dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel
The level of animosity is stoppin' me from thrivin'
Fuck what them niggas is talkin' about, I'm survivin'
Alive and goin' through it, but I made my bed
So now it's in these flames that I lay my head

Prayer III,...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"Let us pray
Lord Jesus it is you who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love, this is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from you Lord; I'm just the one that's givin' it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a longshot, I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, and I'm so tired of the sufferin'
I stand before you, a weakened version of your reflection
Beggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not worship money

Right under they eyes, imagine surprise to the guys
That one of they mans was a bitch in disguise
I'm fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo the Baltimore shit
Nah mean? I'm just robbin to eat
And there's at least a thousand of me like me mobbin' the street
When we starvin' we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the streets, whatever's fair
Bloodstains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not bein' on 1130B to New York
And transforming ass niggas will get it quick
And yo, for real, that nigga 2Pac can suck my dick
And it's gonna take all them niggas in the West Coast
To barely move me, 'cause when I blow shit up
I have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ahhh! You know I don't know how to act
I get too close to niggas, it's like:
""Protected by Viper, stand back""
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
Fuck y'all want me to do wit this coward? ""Finish him!"" It's ended

When I say I'm goin around the way, she won't go

Tryin to get you, to spend the whole night with me

Couldn't treat her like a hoodrat, didn't bite her
Turn a church girl to a straight Ruff Ryder
Take her to the Ramada make it an all nighter

Man, uh
Shit stay happen
Ya know
Its crazy dog
Its off the hook
But you know
Real niggas survive
No regardless
Cause I'm heartless

Who is this I see, coming through, its like 3 in the a.m
I'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him
For being stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2
And havin' a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I leach 'em
Like Jigga said, niggas test you when your gun goes warm
So I keep 'em scattering like roaches, when the light turns off
From night to dawn, right from wrong holds no weight
3-57 slugs with a snub nose, trey eight
Settin' all them issues straight (what) squashing all beefs
To the point where the police be blockin' off streets
Got me trapped up in the building, but you know how that go
I stay fucking with the hood rats and I run up in the rab hole
Run through the hallway, see police, face to face
And being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case

Its either you or me
And more than likely, its gonna be you, than me
Aiight? Feel me, O

Day 2 of the saga, this fucking drama continues
Waking up like every 2 hours, looking out my window
Plus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door just in case
When they bust in, I bust them and I'm gunning for the face
""What a waste of potential"" is what my teachers used to tell me
""You can always get a job"" and cheap shit they tried to sell me
Got me no where but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name, and niggas know my name
Knock of the door ""Police! We're looking for a man
Killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand""
I play like a bitch ""Its just me here, and I'm not dressed
And that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest""
That was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city
'Cause I know I'm hotter than lava, I'll holla tomorrow
Got my dog on the horn, he like ""Fuck, you done did?!
They done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!""
(dial tone)

Put the harness on the dog, load up the weapons
Murder's on my mind, no half steppin'
Motherfuckers want war, you can get it
Cause I'm tired of running, remember me as the nigga that died gunning
Kamikaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest
Run up in that joint, raw dog; fuck the vest
They can keep theirs, cause it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em
It'll be the roar of the C-4 as I'm bringing down the building
When I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckas with me
I ain't sitting around waiting for them faggot niggas to come and get me
I bring it to 'em, service with a smile; what nigga?
Didn't know a dog with rabies was up in the cut, nigga?
Now that you finally finding out what this shit means
I'm at the precinct, 116th
Run up in there, open up my jacket ""You motherfuckas looking for me?""
""Well here I am! Now you coming with me!""

Rudolph the Rednose Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it grows (come on, come on)
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say (what's that?)
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Then all the reindeers loved him
As they shouted out with glee

I've been doing this for too long, plus dog is too strong
Let you catch, fight me off the map with a new song
Man you know you wrong, trying that shit there
Yeah a nigga went there, all you do is sit there

There's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected
You ain't gonna like it, but respect, nigga check it
I'mma get it in till the nigga wins with the dividends
We gon' walk these dogs 'til the bitter end

Pussy, I knew that's how you smelt
But you cats still playing around with just beats
Talking about what you got, ain't air in the teeth
You can put on a vest, but I'mma still stop it
Cause I got a chopper that sound like a helicopter
And niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk
We gon' either chop or slump when I cock and dump
Whether the Glock or pump, cats ain't ready
Half from here to here, lookin like spaghetti
Pull out the machete, hack off the limbs
Bag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs
Jump in the Benz, five cars deep
4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town

The industry; fuck what you heard cause he's bluffing
The industry; money, bitches, hate
But I dare you to try to take a fucking thing off my plate

The industry; vultures with nothing to feast on
The industry; see me I'm getting my beast on
The industry; staying in the dirt, playing in the dirt
Touch the wrong one in the industry and you will get hurt
I'm not an industry artist, I'm an artist in the industry
That's why I do what the fuck I want, cause nobody can finish me
The industry; wanted dead or alive
New artist to sell they souls, the way they survive
The industry don't give a fuck about you
But the industry couldn't make a dime without you
The industry; I'm sick of this industry shit
The industry; playing you like a industry bitch
They try to finish me quick but I am long, so I stand strong
Fuck a beat, listen to the words of the damn song


Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (2X)
Shit is crazy yo
They loaning you money to make a album
You pay 'em back the money, they still on the album
What part of the game is that? (I tell you the truth, I don't lie)
You write your own shit, but they hold on to your shit
What part of the game is that?

Tell me how they feel about this?

All I see red, blood red
Fuck that nigga said? One dead
Gun to the head, didn’t run
But instead, wash my hands and face
His blood, it shed
Never had it all, I was born demented
Fuck apologizing, if I said it, I meant it
If I don’t like you, fuck you
Never pretendin’
Crash blew up and burned – that’s how it ended
Urban legend, I heard it mentioned
Dog is right at home in the dirt and trenches
My birth’s intentions was first the sentence
What’s life without parole for the worse offenses
Senseless slaughters, kicked open the door
Everybody gotta die, wives, sons and daughters
With orders, we are clear from the start
First, turn off the lights
And then murder whatever moves in the dark, nigga

Even though I know it is the truth, you don’t mean it
You haven’t earned it, you haven’t seen it
Nightmares, all you can do is dream it
You run from it, and I end up in between it
What was the first curse, turned into a blessing
With burners that shit was burned, turned into a weapon
Built for war, bitch ass nigga
That shit I’m gonna spit will get you killed through the door
Found ‘em on the floor - the fetal position
There is no 'or,' came here with leave ‘em intentions
Thought shit was funny, like shit you was saying was ill
Until you made that left turn, and shit got real
When it come to rap, you cats got it all wrong
Got bars for days, but can’t make a song
If you did half of what you said when you was flapping your jaw
Push them bricks, the fuck yous rapping for? Nigga!

Yup, yup, yup

Shit, nothing like that dog love I tell ya
Not just any dog, gotta be a pit bull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it

Nothing goes down I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture see the beauty in the beast of
The mad man, Mr. bad man is here
Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
It just ain't fair, the shit that I be doing to niggas
And get away with the same shit ruining niggas
Cover all ground and I roll thick like the fog
Only motha fuckin' friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty
The 5th Precinct to name one of many of'em
In one verse I beat you worse than your momma
I fuck around and eat you first like Dahmer's
I'ma, play that ass out like a bomber
Killed a nigga once for looking like he wanted drama
I'm buggin, the pain it hurts I gotta scream
AHHHHH!
Lettin' off a little steam
Society was just too much, I couldn't hack it
Six motha fuckin' years in a straight jacket
Yo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint
Never really got better so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch
Cause like I said before, I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
The dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick
Word to Miz, you niggas is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play
I'm won't say what's gon' happen if you force my hand
Someone somewhere will be like ""I lost my man""
Take it to heart it's about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggas talking been there done that
What black? Think it's an act? Then let me know
But he liked what I'm saying so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo you think it's a game? Keep playing
They gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek laying
It's over you just ain't laid down yet
And in a minute you gon' be that motha fucka' that ain't found yet
Hold off from making movies and make moves
Stop talking about shit that you can't prove
I'm the mountain you can't move, so why you trying
Looking at me stupid wondering why you dying
While you flying
Through the air with a big ass hole in your chest
Wishing you was holding a vest
But it's too late for wishing so all you getting is rest
Go to sleep, pa pa will take care of the stress
God bless and may He have mercy on your soul
POP POP
Take these two more with you on your stroll, nigga

You made me a leader before I was ready to lead
Took away my hunger but didn't give me greed
Made me successful when I just wanted to be heard
Give me the light, 'cause all I need is the word
Give me a life that I'm responsible for
I'll give Him what's right, 'cause I'm responsible for Him
And into the night, I'm gonna be there with Him
Facin' a fight, I be right there with Him
I'm ready for Heaven, 'cause I done been through the Hell
And since I was seven, I've had a story to tell
See, God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'
He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'

When it didn't go right, You hit me like—
You see, things ain't always what they seem to be
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me
And the reason I get through things so easily
Is by the grace of God 'cause He sees the need to guide me
Walk right beside me
Because He knows what's goin' on inside me, He tried me
Knew where my heart was at, knew what I was thinkin'
Knew when I was down and out, left there stinkin'
Knew when to pick me up 'cause it got too hard
Knew when I was gonna scream out: ""Please God!""
And You already knew that You would be there for me

The essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the Earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man is not measured by what he does for himself, but what he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for a reward or gold
What you give, you shall recieve tenfold
And I put that on my soul, and put that on my life
And everything I own, and everything I know
And everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everwhere I been, I was for a reason
Walked through the desert, ended up freezin'

ATF,It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,1998.0,"Got me on the run
Uh, uh

""BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! Open the door, ATF!""
Too late to send my girl downstairs to say he left
Hit the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war
You know I laced the four with the hollows
Crack the safe, grab the bottles
What you want me to do?
 Beep Carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go Grease, yo, get in, you drive
What the fuck you doing nigga?
 Tryna stay alive
Cops on every corner, I lean back and try to cruise by
Who the fuck could'a snitched? Must have been a new guy
Damn, they back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Trying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast
Trying to take the niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass
Hey, look out, skrrt! Damn, came so close
You almost hit that bitch! (
Like you said nigga, almost
)
Shit, the cops hit her and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
*breathing* 
Drop it on the floor!
*click* Boom! Got it through the door
Pedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'
Death is in the air and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is, ""What about my kids?""
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a joint from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm going out fast, and the last thing I hear is
""BOOM, BOOM, BOOM! Open the door, ATF!""",https://genius.com/Dmx-atf-lyrics

If I was testin' your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me 'cause you dont even know me
Nigga check me (Come on!)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin
Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin (Uh)
Bad decisions lead to last decisions (What?)
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin' (What?)
Take it over there, now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?  (Arf!)
Let me break it down for you, he's about to attack you (Arf!)
Still standin' here, faggot? You must want me to smack you! (Arf, arf!)
You ain't been there or done that, (What?) fuck is y'all niggas tellin' me?
I'm the only nigga, walkin' the streets with four felonies (Come on!)

Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine

Give it to niggas just how they give it to, me
Hit em in a rhyme because I'm a MC
Been a lot of places most niggas won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be
Let your man hold somethin now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggas want, raw
Niggas laugh at me and was mad at me
Cuz the way life was goin had to be a, tragedy (Come on!)
But after me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggas go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it (Come on!)
So if I see it, I'ma dot it, (What?) where to hide it
You gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it (Come on!)

We both know you pussy but you stay talkin' shit
What I'ma have to do dog, run up in your mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in your chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows

Dogs Out,Grand Champ,2003.0,"This is dedicated to, this is dedicated to

And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out

Started gettin a little too big for the cage that I been trapped in
Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin to rappin
Guns got the clappin, another trip to the morgue
We all know why it's happenin, another bit by the dog
When there's nothin left to eat, I ate away at my soul
Felt destructive cause I don't give a fuck if I go
I know y'all been told I don't give a fuck about livin
Killin other dogs got you cats chasin Pigeons
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within
What I catch I'mma eat, in the streets I'mma win
I've been top dog and I'mma stay top dog
So what the fuck you got to say dog?
You cats play games that dog ain't with
Suck my dick, behind my back dog ain't shit
Well this is it, from now on if you ain't out the camp
We out to vamp, put 'em up against the champ
You bitch

And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon

I don't think you cats see too clearly
If it ain't that you must be deaf, cause y'all niggas don't hear me
But I know I got you scared to death
How many other niggas you know when you see 'em make you hold your breath?
All a nigga did was take a pause
Did a couple of movies and you thought this whole rap shit was yours?
Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggas like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't wanna see your man missin, man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit
The way dog flip out, cats'll never understand
Niggas be like ""X I thought I was your man!""
Not!

This is dedicated to, this is dedicated to
The streets, this is dedicated to

My dogs is dogs that love to brawl
Bring as many as you got cause we gon fuck 'em all
Dicksucked in the hall
The same shorty thats puttin any work on her knees
I'm duckin her call
A dog is a dog is a dog for life, dog been a dog, dog in your wife
I got kids this age
But let 'em keep talkin slick and I'm gon put somethin hot up in his ribcage

When the dog is out, bitch ass niggas get bit or fucked

Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

My dogs is dogs with official bloodlines
I say ""Stop Being Greedy,"" get a plate, you want mine
Why do niggas always force you take it back to the streets?
Can I at least go one year without spitting the heat?
Motherfuckers think it's sweet until you get your chest messed up
Two days later he's dressed up, let him rest up
He ain't going nowhere, no time soon
Remember 
High Noon
? Last thing he heard was ""Boom""!
Can I get some room or do I gots to, make me a path?
Break you in half, fake niggas make me laugh
Y'all niggas is funny, still talking 'bout money
And ain't got none, get the shotgun 'cause you hungry
It's about to get ugly when the, lights is out
One, two, three, ho that's three strikes you out
His knife was out, I think they found it still in his hand
He in a bag and I'm over here, killing his man!

All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood

I no longer see the shadows that once kept me strong
And I'm starting to get that same feeling that kept me wrong
Can't afford to trust niggas cause niggas lust figures
Plus niggas is scared to bust niggas, rush niggas
Dueling with the heat, and ain't killing nothing but time
Fucking with the street, but you ain't feeling nothing but mine
Tired of hearing niggas rhyme that don't say shit
Fuck is on them niggas minds, why don't they quit?
Sucking my dick looking for something new
Let your man hold something with your hold something crew
You know how niggas do, we don't forget shit
If you was there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick
No hitchhikers, fuck that, the Ryde was Ruff
And every nigga that was wit us, that died was Ruff
A lot of niggas that are wit us, ain't cried enough
So now when niggas come and get us, we fires em up

Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

Motherfuckers, thought that the, X would stop
But I got niggas like, ""Yo, who's the next to drop?""
From his camp, get the stamp, grand champ, it's official
Think when you die how many's gon' miss you
Lean over in your casket and kiss you
Send you on your way with a blessing
And pray that another learned a lesson
Smith and Wesson ended money's life, now money's wife's a widow
(Gave it to him full blast?) Nah dog, just a little
Beside rap I don't talk but make plenty of moves
I'll murder, ten of you fools before you're ready to choose
You either, win or you lose, and I, love to win
Even if it means I gotta shed blood again
Keep the bank account doubling, but don't hate me
Really thought that what you said would either, make me or break me?
Knowin it don't take me long to write
Matter of fact, I think I'll drop another, song tonight

Niggas know the deal just waitin for them plaques to get shipped
Do your thing, nigga, you know we got your back

Bless the body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it wasn't going for it
My nigga had to give it to me (AHH!) then I saw it
This is clear as day I know here's the day
I'm gonna be on my way nothing more to say
But take me lord make me lord what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill

Uhh, Ruff Ryders, WHAT?!
Volume One, Swizz Beats (WHOOO!)
WHAT?!
Uhh, uhh, (WHAT?!) all aboard!

If I thought y'all niggas really wanted drama
I woulda been pulled out the armor, word to my momma
I'mma -- hit y'all niggas with somethin that you ain't never felt (WHAT?!)
Hit y'all niggas for frontin you caught up in that hell (WHAT?!)
If I thought that half the shit that bitches said was true
I'd be spitting lead at you, to dead your crew
But -- if you know a bitch, you don't listen to that bitch
You don't argue with that bitch, all you do is fuck that bitch!
If I listened to all the snake niggas that's runnin they mouth
I wouldn't be in the crib, I'd be loadin up, to run in your house
But -- you can't fuck with cowards, cause a coward'll be a coward
He'll end up killin these cowards, and I'm not feelin these cowards!
If I let the niggas around my way tell me how to feel about me
I guess I really, wouldn't be D
But I'm the best that ever did it, the best at it because I live it
How many niggas eat it and shit it, you cats want it? Come and get it!
Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)
Grrr, ARF ARF, woo woo!
Grrr, ARF ARF, woo woo!
Tell me how you feelin now (WHAT?!) I know you illin now (WHAT?!)
Tell me how you feelin now (WHAT?!) I know you illin now (WHAT?!)

It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna SEE it when it's comin, so I can open faces
Open cases got me PAYIN to stay out of jail (WHAT?!)
While these streets, got me to prayin to stay out of hell (C'MON!)
Slipped, and I fell, got back up -- slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good with it!
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood did it!
Knew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it (okay)
Seein niggas havin a good time, so I'mma ruin it (yeah)
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush!
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu
Now peep what I just said and see how long it takes to hit you
Everybody knows you can talk all day (YES)
But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away? (YES)
Chorus

Man, I told you I lock jaws, carry a Glock four
Close my eyes on y'all niggas, the bullets'll watch yours
Then I gotta open up another can of ass-whippin
Y'all niggas better pucker up, time for some real ass-kissin
I'm a simple man, I lead a simple life, I mean simple like
I don't need much to be aight, live off the land, eat at night
Handle whatever's comin when I get there, but I'm good (WHAT?!)
Dismantle whatever's comin, y'all niggas sit there and put up hoods!
How my niggas feelin? (GOOD!) How my niggas like it? (ROUGH!)
What my niggas want? (BLOOD!) We stay callin niggas bluff
But if it's got to be, then it's gon' be, c'mon let's eat
Whatever my niggas want from me, is what my niggas gonna get from me
And if I ever.. let the words, of another nigga bother me
I might as well.. let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
But they know, like I know, the black Rhino
Niggas rippin through em and let the nine blow
Nigga die slow! Oh.. oh oh!!

Keep (

When I think I don't deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I'm worth it
I know I got a purpose, so when I don't like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look past the surface
Believe me God heard this, 'cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know that he would lighten up my load
And it's gon' get greater, later
God only wants the best for me, but the devil's a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If y'all think hate wins... just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who's will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes through
The spiritual individual is in you

Lord if you hear me, You know that I'm comin' to You sincerely
I need You near me, please feel me
I'm sick and I need for You to heal me
I'm lost and lookin' for the real me, I'm tired and weary
Haven't been able to see things clearly
And even though I know You love me dearly, 
I still get leery
So where does that leave me? Lost and alone
I wanna call God but it's like I lost my phone
Every day is a struggle, 'cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God, 'cause only he could solve 'em
I'm tired of lyin' to myself, thinkin' I could do it on my own
But when I get left alone
That's when the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly then peeks in
And it's usually around the weekends
That I get reckless and jump off the deep end

Come on

Slippin Again,Undisputed,2012.0,"It's what it is baby
It's straight biz baby
We ain't kids baby
We get down like that

Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

(Check it), more money more problems
I thought more money would solve 'em
I spent more money in Harlem
Than Frank Lucas did before the boys got 'em
Now the shit done changed
How I'm feelin'? the shit look strange
I realize that shit ain't the same
'Cause at the end of the day this shit ain't a game
Nigga goin' through it but I slipped and fell
Ran to the hood, took a trip to Hell
Deal when I should, that's why all my shit sell
Always know I could, so I did well

Slippin' and fallin'

Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'

If y'all only knew
What my life was like, and what I'm goin' through
Maybe you'd think before you talk (okay?!)
You better crawl before you walk (come on!)
You think havin' money is the answer?
Money ain't nothin' but another form of cancer
All you could do is watch me die
You don't wanna watch me cry, so watch me fly!
What you gon' do is watch me fly
Do my thing on that big stage in the sky
Lord, please, hold me down
'Cause now everybody wanna know me now

Slippin' and fallin'
This time it got a nigga callin'
Up to the Lord where I'm crawlin'
On my knees 'cause I'm tired of slippin' and fallin'

Please help me, which way do I go?
Life's a book, which page do I show?
'Cause I know, can't show 'em all
Even though I slipped and fell I won't fall
Get it? Okay, you don't
Some of y'all will but most of y'all won't
I'mma keep livin' life bein' the man
That God made me 'cause I know only He can save me

Coming From,"Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood",1998.0,"Believe me when I say
Before light, there was dark

Where you going, where you going?
Where you going, where you going?
Where you going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?

Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know it's only gonna get worse
Love, or a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it began
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Thin love, hold me down baby, it's gon' be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like ""Oh, it's him again""
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in '89
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go

Where would I go?
-So the hell with you
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-I think I'm going to the top
Me and DMX

I will spend mad time in one spot, plottin' my next move
Tryin' figure out - why is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered (why?), that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, cause they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grime
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Lighter side of the dark, fight in the park but wouldn't wanna
Stayed and fought, but when they jumped me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke; I had the last laugh

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
-If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
-Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Where we going, where we going, where we going?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Where I'm going
Where would I go?
-But I know where I'm going
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Do you know, do you know
Where would I go?
-I go, I go

I feel the ghost from within, comin' back to haunt me
Stay lovin' my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been gettin' love, but instead was plottin'
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the 4-4, leave 'em dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs that I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill 'em
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hatin', when I can show love
What's the sense of fakin', when I can show blood

Now what's the moral to this story?
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-If I don't know, I don't know
Where would I go?
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-I don't know
Where would I go?
-But I know where I'm coming from
If I don't know where I'm coming from
-Do you know where you're coming from?

With Chinese slippers and silk scarves on

I couldn't take it, deface it, that nigga make shit
That's somethin' that'll happen, nigga wanna brace it
And for the record, what you gonna do to fill up my spot?

Let me tell you what niggas in jail say across that table
That you are the cutest bitch on your label
Only records you got are the ones you signing on (la la la)
Never been to jail, never had a block you were slanging on
We all rode with killers just think
But you, come on dog, the only thing you murdered was inc
You got to watch the shit you say to niggas
Sitting over there smiling, but pussy, I don't play with niggas
I'm about to make you a fucking believer
Next time send your man in your place cause I don't battle divas

Time's up! What the fuck? That's the verdict

Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (nigga!)
I look through the 11th floor window
Take one last puff of the indo
Look through the scope, and let like ten go
Break it down, back in the briefcase
Wipe the sweat off my face so I can leave safe
Outside I breathe safe
Nigga never saw it comin, that's how he got it
Never even thought of runnin, cause a nigga plotted
Smart niggas get niggas killed for real
I know, they make a deal? I'm comin with the steel
It's gon' be that cat you don't see that's gon' pop you
Stop you in your motherfuckin tracks nigga and drop you
Get rid of all the clothes (uh-huh) dump the gun
I hate to be the type of nigga to leave you, slugged and run
But I'm on the job and right now there's more niggas that need to be, left with a head full of lead, restin easily
And that twenty G's a fee, put to a good use
The only excuse I have for what I do is, love of abuse
Chorus 2X

I can catch you in the very building that you live in
Wait until you get right at your door then start spittin
Now they got a ribbon tied to the rail at the top of the steps
I was there, you ain't DIE at the top of the steps
I can do that walk behind you shit and follow you home (shhh)
Make a noise, you turn around and I put one in your dome (BOOM!
Last thing you saw was chrome and a, flash of light
I blast him right, nigga, that's yo' ass tonight
I could put a bomb in your car and watch it explode (BOOM!)
Then make em call, tell em all they found was a piece of your clothes and a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm
Which they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb
I could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat
With some fuckin chickenwire, soon as you hit the backstreet
I jump up like Jack-in-the-Box, strangle the shit out yo' ass
Clean up the mess and, get away from the cops
Chorus 2X

I could be the UPS delivery boy (uh-huh) or the man
Workin at Toys'R'Us handin yo' kid a brand new toy
I could be the one servin your food wherever you go to eat at
Or that nigga on the corner that you ask, ""Yo, where the weed at?""
I could be the one driving the school bus that yo' kids in
Except that, I don't like to involve, women and children
A nigga got feelings, I just put em aside
And when it's time for me to do my job, I just ride
I don't get much sleep (uh) my soul's tormented
I wish it was a lie but everything I said I meant it
I know I'm doin wrong and everyday I beg the Lord
To forgive me for fuckin with the, double-edged sword
Shit ain't goin too well, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE
I know I'm goin to hell, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE
Sometimes I think what will I do, WITH MY LIFE
Kill nigga kill this IS MY LIFE

D-X-L (Hard White),...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"Holiday Styles
Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck
If I ain't gettin proper respect
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die
I ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)
Cause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)
You know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O
You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool
And I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school
No pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God
Play Sheik out in the yard, but that shit too hard
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die
From rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga
Bounty hunt your whole crew til my bullets go through, WHAT?

Yo, yo, yo, yo
All I need is a big gun and a Coupe that's crazy quick
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip
Bet you never even felt the heat
Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease
Streets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox
Same niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)
All types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh)
Nice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)
Find your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)
It's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)
Uh

Creep through the streets
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard
Me the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off
And take casket naps, fuck that
You shoulda never let this bastard rap
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance
So you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin
Drag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em
Drag done ate your food
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well
I don't brag I let the streets tell
Po'-po' now you see he fell
 {*overlapping last line*}
Uh, uh, now you motherfuckers
Know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)
Y'all bitches fear it cause you weak
You wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin (uh-huh)
What the science behind that son? (I don't know)
A lot of easy walkin
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)
Ain't tryin to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon)
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh)
It can get ""Dark"" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that
Now don't act, cause actin might get you rollin
With what you ain't ready to handle (UHH)
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)
It happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas
Talkin reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)
From the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight
Let them cats spit that weak shit (What!)

Trina Moe,The Great Depression,2001.0,"Ayo! Bounce to that Trina Moe
Niggas about to blow
Bouncin' straight out the door
Here we go, here we go

Bloodline, scratch all day, match all weight
Only dogs eating is us, we snatch all plates
Err, ERR! ERR! Get him, boy!
Click, click, pop the leash, hit him, boy!
Niggas brag about waggin', we stop the tails
X drop an album, niggas droppin' sales
Niggas can't fuck with the dog, forget about it
Money went up against the dog, read about it
Man, listen, you cats better walk easy
I'm on some positive shit, but I still walk greasy
Ain't nothing changed, still ain't sweet
Stand on one block, but I own the whole street
And on the whole street is dirty niggas with funny moves
Leaving your house with bloody boots, we cruddy dudes
Rest of them ass kissers is sensitive ass niggas
Fourth album, and I still get in that ass, nigga


It's Dark and Hell is Hot
Flesh of my Flesh, Blood of my Blood; And Then There Was X
Got niggas like, ""What's next and then?""
Hit 'em again, you cats ain't never gon' win
I was here before most of y'all careers were born
I'll be here when y'all careers are gone, still strong
Difference between right and wrong is me
Niggas talk shit, but you can't MC
We already know how much your watch is worth
Talk about helping the hurt, saving the Church
Why don't you brag about helping out where you come from?
And give brothers a job that really want one?
Gotta think about that shit you said, you don't mean it
I done listened to that shit you said, but I done seen it
Most of you cats is type funny
But when it comes time to feed the hungry, gon' get type ugly


Man, I'm already knowin', like y'all niggas is knowin'
You can't fuck with dog, bust a cap, scrap or flowin'
Seeing is believing, and well, let's just see
I ain't even gon' speak, one million the first week
Aight, let's ask the streets: How many sold?
What? Three niggas, three months to go gold?
C'mon, ese, keep it real, homes
You fuckin' with the dog, you already know
This ain't nothing new, fuck is you mad at?
15 million! Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Rest assured, I'm best abroad
You can test Billboard because the rest are frauds
I got 18 years under my belt, rappin'
Let me see, you was three, I was making it happen
Next time we bump heads, don't be hard headed

Sent to live and die, on earth as a lesson
We each have a star, all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya
Niggas ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)
That's what I thought, them niggas was bluffin (uh)
They talk all day but say, nothin (uh)
It gets so dark (what?) the pain's so intense
Since this first rain it's like it's rained ever since (WHAT?)

Stoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)
Them cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)
Dark Man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war

See I'm a thorough bread, I don't fuck wit much
Bloodline is where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ, yea what black
Don't nothin move less, dog say so
Cats clueless about the way it go
Off the chain I got at least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill cuz they feel dog
I can't help what it is, shit is real dog
You must have thought that it was a joke or somethin'
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin'
Now hold up playa cuz I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit cuz I don't say no names
See what I know I'm taking to the fuckin' grave
So keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin' thing


Ay yo
Who we be was off the last joint
But now it's who we see and we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before Kool G Rap talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin' me
Cuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on, another batch is born
Don't give a fuck about none of y'all
Fuck each and every one of y'all
Cuz I done done it all, been where ya at
Been where ya goin', then brought it back
I tried to tell ya about it but you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood cuz the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened cuz then you woulda known
That it's only right to give a dog a bone

Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand
When a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got Paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
Ear to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast, that's the Lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door, Shhh chill
You sit right there, I'm gonna answer that
Cuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back

Father thank you for makin' me righteous and accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection, your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with is my favor-shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special priveledges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything that the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries, and an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turnarounds and miraculous breakthroughs; in the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time, the designated moment for me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed

We built this Double R thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggas round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!
Thorough type niggas that control the streets
Rollin' deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggas goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out
C'mon fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pit bull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9

And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggas a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggas that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
Out in Cali sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines
I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind

So when it come to pussy you just one more
Hit 'em with the 'what for'
That's when you know a nigga's a bitch and he's still gonna' get the hand, but you like, ""What for?""
Really? You want more?
I come through with the click, click boom - click, click, boom
Put it through your front door
Brains on the wall like paint
'cause I don't need to know what it is as long as I know what it ain't
Ain't a fuckin' thing fake about me
The devil spent so much time ruining my life
What would the snake do without me?
Keep running your fucking mouth and see what happens to niggas that keep running they fucking mouth
They get knocked the fuck out, nigga

La familia
If it ain't about the dog, we ain't feelin' ya'
A lot of rappers been soft for a long time
Bout to put the hoodie dog all times
They said pain is back
I said, naw, Bain is back
The Dark Knight blitzing with the hoodie on
Listen, I'll come through your block
Make all your niggas really missing
Where they at now?
You want that real shit, don't cha'?
You want that street shit, don't cha'?

Real niggas recognize real niggas man
A real nigga ain't gonna go through the trouble of trying a real nigga
Cuz he know a real nigga will get down just like he get down
And he don't want that headache
He'd rather push up on a soft ass nigga
He spot a bitch nigga from a mile away
And carry 'em just like, know what I mean?",https://genius.com/Dmx-bain-iz-back-lyrics

I just want to make you right
Wanna be the one you could cry on

Baby, it's like I love my wife
But we goin through things and I ain't goin home tonight
You got time for a nigga, or is he still with you?
Wanna meet at the same spot, or should I come and get you?
Aight, I'll be there in 10, be in the front
I been gettin what I need so I'mma give you what you want
One-on-one, cause you know how to talk to Dog
You walk the dog and understand New York is hard, baby

 So you, you ain't gotta go home tonight
 You can stay right here with me

To keep on loving, and keep on trusting
When, in return all you get is nothing

Damn, you got me fucked up and I'm feelin it more
Never had a mis-tress dis-tressed before
Oh come on ma, like it ain't that deep
Like ain't no love there, like I don't hate that I gotta creep
We go to sleep in each others arms (YEA!)
And I feel like this is where I belong

Make a Move,...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"Grrrrrrrrrrrrr..
Mm..
Chorus: DMX
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uhh
I gots to take a block and make it boom {*BOOM*}
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money!

It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
Til I knock off this rock I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strongarm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin cats just as broke as myself
Livin foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, cause niggas talk about goin out of state
Money got an eighth, comin back, hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'mma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doin bad
Will be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down
Chorus 2X

I gots to make a move and make it soon
Gots to take a block and make it boom
We comin through so make some room
Found somethin that could be somethin if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
The purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'mma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin
Killin the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
Cause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (""Ahhhhh!"")
You think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'
Chorus 2X

I spend my money on niggas cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin shit but suckin my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas over six blocks, makin the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin what they been wantin
And we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin
Stick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em
Them motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they, really tryin to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit
Ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (why nigga?)
Cause I'm a hustlin motherfucker, and I'm holdin my block down

Shit up foreal, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill is all I've been hearin lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefin but a lot of them bluffin
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough
Not just for frotin
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?' the battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasin em down
We all knew that you was pussy but I'm tastin it now
And never give a dog blood because raw blood
I have a dog like one bitin whatever

Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back
Trieed to strike back
Left him like that, layin up with the white hat
Gettin right back at ya when I snatch ya up out the grave, nuthin but bones and ashes
Hittin niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That Nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He went through like 20 G's and thought that
I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinkin and eventually found that's what you get for stinkin
Blowin up the spot when you rot plus if it gets hot they know you dipped
For four squared blocks
Hit em with the ox to the grill

The Prayer VI,Year of the Dog... Again,2006.0,"In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, verse 15
Do not love the world or anything in the world
And we know what that means, but listen
We know the distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home, instill in us the word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the annointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen and amen",https://genius.com/Dmx-the-prayer-vi-lyrics
Cold World,Undisputed,2012.0,"Does it really get this cold in the summer
Does it really get this dark in the day
Do they really turn they backs when you talkin'
Would they lay somebody's else's head where you lay
Do they find it easy to be hard
And find it even harder to be easy
You know sometimes I close my eyes and I wonder
If I ever left how much you'd miss me
Oh, somebody told me 
blood was thicker than water
If a man can say that he can recognize his own daughter
And if hell is below would you pay the price to go
Then I can make it to heaven for sure

This is a cold world (what), cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
This is a cold world (what), cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way

Cats don't know what they say what they talkin'
So I just let a nigga say what he feel
Fuckin' with the kid they gon' end up in the coffin
'Cause I'ma say what I gotta say with the steel
Niggas hatin' 'cause I got a job
I know it's they job to be hatin'
I'm a dog so I don't fuck with cats
'Cause they gon' have me livin' in a state pen
It's about time I reacted
Look what y'all did to this rap shit
Knowin' niggas is wrong, come on with the cat shit
Wack shit, get niggas torn down, slapped quick
Blam, blam, blam, go down that quick
Actin' like the truth was gone
And I'm sayin' gotta deal with the ruthless one
It's 2 piece, leave your faggot ass toothless son
I go hard, dog don't do it, too late, it's done
Hold up, I'ma show you why dog is the illest, kill this
You might not catch it, but you'll feel this
The realest nigga to ever do it
The realest nigga to ever go through it and y'all gon' bring me back to it
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Middle name is grime, came from crime
You thought I'ma change with time, niggas don't know me
Let your man hold somethin', you ain't got it, nigga show me

This is a cold world, cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way
This is a cold world, cold world
We make it this way, but we don't like it this way

The tunnel looks bright up from behind but you gotta keep movin', movin', movin'
Because if life stops spinnin' in the right direction whose losin', losin', losin', losin'
See in the night, I pray to keep me breathin'
To see another day to give them somethin' to believe in

So that's like 9 years delinquent time, you speak in crime then you know
9 years you owe, get knocked, 9 years you gonna go
No probation or parole more time doin' nothin'

Bury niggas easy 'cause they get killed like that

I bet you thought it was real funny, until it had to get cruddy
Me walkin' off leavin' you with all this bloody

A blast of light, that's what he seein' if you blast him right
Hit him in his face and hear them close the casket tight
'Cause it's like it ain't nothin' but endin' it to a nigga

When you in the house you'll play by house rules
Two words you'll never hear again are house lose
And that's house choose it ain't gonna be that, 'cause I can't see that
Ready to get up in this nigga's ass real good so where the weed at
Believe that, you ain't gon' see nothin' gettin' too familiar
And I would tell you what I do but then I'd have to kill you
And it ain't even worth it, I ain't gon' build nothin'
So I just let you go be that same nigga, still frontin'

A Minute for Your Son,The Great Depression,2001.0,"You got a minute for Yo' son, Father? I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin' to run, Father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done, Father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need You, God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for You one day
Up in there like, ""Hallelujah!"" on Sunday
I thank You Lord for the blessings that You gave me
And for my life, with the blessings You have saved me
And for my wife, You have carried me enough times - and that's the truth
Married me to rough times, throughout my Youth
And through it all I saw that You was still with me
I was that one lost sheep and You was comin' to get me

Lord You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord You got me like... Your love got me like...

I look at life a little different now, since You hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank You for the love, Lord, we praise Ya
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin' the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right, just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout Yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and, when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' have to tell me twice, I'mma take heed
And because of what You've given me, I know You'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to Ya
That's why I had to dedicate somethin' new to Ya, thank You Father

Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

Uhh... I never knew a love like, this before
Messin with the thug life I, missed it all
You opened the doors and, let me in
I'm down for the cause so, let's begin
Prayers that You give to me I give to them
Same way You live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now
You got me smilin' from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore
Only sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years
You know that... one day I'll speak the word
You know that... when I do I will be heard
You know that... You gave me a permanent smile
And You know this, Father, because I'm Yo' child, what?

Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

The heat is on
You know

The heat is on, what's my next move
Do I stick with the score, or get with the door
Feds got the drop in the back of the Uhaul
Snipers on the roof, chance of gettin' away - too small
Tell 'em like this, ""Look, it's gonna be a shoot out
Whoever make it out meet back at the new house
Good luck, if I don't see you again peace
Let's handle our business with these government police""
You and you go out the front, you take the back
You cover the first two and I'll take the sack
Boomer didn't make it, neither did Stan
Now it's three niggas, splittin' four hundred grand (aight)
We all feel the loss but enjoy the profit
The game is the same, ain't nothin' gonna stop it
Most times you make it, one time you won't
All niggas could really do is have a vest under the coat (come on)

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

Me and my two mans gave money, twenty grand
For a scam, they don't get the condo in the sand
And chance of gettin' caught slim next to none
But now we like three deep, need that extra gun
Bump into my man, I remember from up north
I remember he had principles and wasn't nothin' soft
Off to discuss, just what's goin' dizzy
Everybody got it? Aight, let's get busy
Run up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck
Yo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)
We on the clock, three minutes until we finished
Feds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach
In and out, duffel bag across the back
Extra large sports coat to cover up the Mac
Feds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out
Run up on a civilian in his car, make him get out

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

High speed chasin', racin' through the streets
Death's in the air, I can taste it through the heat
My partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last
But if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half
But that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'
I made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens
What can I do, but go on livin'
Fleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon
Life goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey
We all live by the rules of the game we play
Day to day, death is a possibility
The way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me
It's too hot to be in the heat 'casue it's on
Too hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone
Go back to bein' discreet, live long
'Til one day either me or the heat is gone
Come On!

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on

More 2 a Song,...And Then There Was X,1999.0,"Uhh.. c'mon!

(Dog) It's more to a song than, jewelry and clothes
More to a nigga's life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

Niggas - walk around frontin (frontin) talkin bout jewels (jewels)
How much you bust tools, y'all niggas sounds like fools (woo)
Who you really think give a fuck how much your watch cost? (mm-hmm)
How much your watch cost? You bout to get your watch lost (aight)
If you flashin' it, you must not want it
See I fuck with real niggas that done it
You know what time it is, run it!
Niggas got more important shit to deal with
Talkin' about some 4 wheel shit
But my man here is about to kill shit (UH!)
Keep playin' niggas pussy, and you will get fucked
Why don't you cop some more ice dog;
Then you will get stuck and fucked
Bitch ass nigga, hit my street
And see what happens to that iceberg when it's hit by heat (woo)
It won't be a pretty sight, you and your pretty wife
Oh you must have forgot dog, this is the city life (aight?)
Ain't a fuckin thing sweet, and ain't nothing fair
Just another nigga dead, don't a motherfucker care

(Dog) It's more to a song than, jewelry and clothes
More to a niggas life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

Born and raised in the projects and can't forget it
And all that grimy shit niggas do, I done did it (uhh)
And I'm still with it, nigga I stay in the hood
But when the cats is out, bet the dog, play in the hood
You keep bringin' them fake bitches through
You gon' fuck around and make bitches do (WHAT?), we take bitches too (aight?)
And if you comin through my block, it's gon' be the last stop
We blast tops, faggot couldn't make it to the stash box (c'mon!)
Big ass rocks, I want that! Fuck the blood
All that shit washes off, the next day I'm like, ""What?""
Flossin' yo' shit, what I want for yo' shit? (uhh, uhh)
Give a nigga like three bricks to feed the dogs with
Cause I ain't really gots to shine (Why?) When they do, I do
For me, them niggas'll hide you, where nobody'll find you
If you eatin' motherfucker, then your dogs should be eatin too
Not just four or five niggas, 'cause you know what the streets'll do

(Dog) It's more to a song than, jewelry and clothes
More to a niggas life than, money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you, think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

I will be the voice of the street till I die (die)
Cause I know if I keep my heart real, I'm gon' fly (fly)
Either let me fly or give me death; if you didn't catch it then
Get it now, cause it's all that's left
And this will be the last breath (uh) provokin' my niggas (uh)
To start choking y'all niggas (WHAT?) and smokin' y'all niggas
A nigga would never have to say, ""X feed me!""
You'll never hear a nigga say, ""X is greedy!""
Only, ""X believe me! I didn't know it was a setup!""
Get up, cocksuckin' motherfucker, shut up
Shut up {​​​​​​​​​*""pop pop""*}​​​​​​​​​ Fuck you nigga
From the hood to the wood, fuck you nigga
This for my dogs, til death do us part
I'm still here, cause I been here from the start (aight?)
If I'm ever anywhere, anytime it gets ugly (WHAT?)
The dog is aight, cause I know the streets love me (grrrrrrrrr)

(Dog) It's more to a song than jewelry and clothes
More to a niggas life than money and hoes
The game is a lot bigger than you think you know
And if you think you know, then I don't think you know

This is what you're tellin me, okay
It all comes down to this huh? Okay
This is what you fuckin tellin me?
That this is it? Okay (GRRRRRRRRRR)
How many slugs should I plug into yo' chest before it's get filled
Since you ain't got nuttin else to do but get killed
Been a fiend every since I found out how a slaughter taste
Empty a clip of hollow tips into yo' daughter's face
Cause that's just the type of shit that I'm on
Collect my dough, make the fuckin hit and I'm gone
I ain't never gots to worry about the aim
Infrared, to your head, will make sure, I hit him in the brain
BLAOW! One mo' time for good luck - for what?!
He was already dead, what the fuck?!
I be, breakin my shit up OFF in a nigga
When I don't see, nuttin but SOFT in a nigga
Fuckin coward, I wonder how it - feels
To have to look at your moms - squeal, after I hit her with the steel
Ill, that's how a nigga blows shit up
Believe whoever I hit up, will never get up
Tell me, how it's goin down nigga
If I'm bein a fuckin clown nigga (yeah)
Take a couple of rounds nigga, I keep a toast real close
In case I gotta turn the rest of yo' peeps into ghosts
Fuck it I'm ready for combat, with a gat
That'll make any nigga, become a meal for the fuckin rats
There won't be nuttin left of money but a soupbone
Big Motherfuckin DMX from the group home

Niggas don't mean what they say when they talk
Niggas lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Niggas don't mean what they say when they talk
Niggas lean a certain kind of way when they walk

Since the first day in it, I made a promise to myself
I was gonna make it happen, that's the way I felt
You know Philly never scared, play the cards we dealt
Doin it my way, you bitches strugglin for help
I hear your rumors and your so-called beefs
But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch, your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it, go 'head let you warm up the crowd for me
I hate to even be like this, y'all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me, I scream it out
Sick wid'dit, ain't a bitch that can get wid'dit
Admit it, I'm that bitch you can't live wid'dit
And I'mma keep it comin long as I'm here
Pitbull, back at'cha neck, I'm hearin them cheer
E-V-E is what they need in they life, I'm bout mine
Now I'm done wit'chu, fuck out my face, wastin my time

Bitches don't mean what they say when they talk
Bitches lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Bitches don't mean what they say when they talk
Bitches lean a certain kind of way when they walk

Nahh! Uh, yeah, aiyyo
I got a wet haze, coke, and a p-blow block
But y'all still missin the point like a free throw shot
Get it? This ain't some'n you learn, this is some'n you earn
Turn it up and give me some'n to burn
That boy 'Kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone, so try to get a helluva plan
Cause most dudes left the hood broke
A couple knew what they was doin, so they came back like good coke
Down South they'll tell you 'Kiss is good folk (that's right)
Up North I hit my niggas off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard
I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 'Kiss is the monster
D-Block and Double R is my sponsor

Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk
Cowards lean a certain kind of way when they walk
Cowards don't mean what they say when they talk
Cowards lean a certain kind of way when they walk
 Fuckin cowards!

Niggas can't be fuckin serious, y'all niggas pussy
Niggas pussy - y'all don't like it? BRING IT, BITCH!
Just a lil' some'n man, to let y'all know
To niggas know man, matter of fact
Matter of fact y'all niggas, excuse my back man!
Straight up y'all niggas, pardon my back!

Shorty Was Da Bomb,The Great Depression,2001.0,"*BEEP* Thursday, June 28th, 2:02 AM
""I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza, but… and you said you were on your way, but there's just one problem
I'm all the way to fucking Rochester, New York. Wrong ho!""

Uhh, yo yo… yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfucking dog!
Don't get a dog if you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfucking break, will ya?

Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a lil hoe, but still, yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like blaow
Had me scheming on how I could get that now
Was like girlfriend, let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was going down
She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man, but even if she did dead
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said, we'll get up like nine or somethin'
Don't act like when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin'
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause, dog, shorty was the bomb

Shorty, UH! We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH! We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!

A few days later, I hit her up just to keep it real
Was like, ""Whassup, boo? How you been? How you feel?""
She said, ""Aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it should've been here on the 8th""
I'm like, ""For real?! Don't stress it, it'll come
It better cause I can't afford another little one""
She said, ""Neither can I"", I said, ""Cool
Cause I got mad shit to do and you still going to school""
So at least we had the same thing in mind
Not to have this kid and everything would be fine
But I was blind to the fact that she was setting me up
For the kill, damn, why wasn't she on the pill?
And I still would check on her like once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like, ""I ain't having this kid, is you crazy?""


By now, wasn't looking too good
Cause she wasn't doing things that she told me she would
Like getting the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
And a half, I had to laugh out of frustration
Now she's four months, I'm ready to hit the bus station
If I was still on that shit it would've made me rob her
Told her friends, ""DMX? Yeah, that's my baby's father""
Her lil' stomach is shown, so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me, so I played the game on her level, got sneaky
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature
Found out she was six months when she said she was four
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb",https://genius.com/Dmx-shorty-was-da-bomb-lyrics

Make you throw your bike's up
Make you rep your hood, now scream
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I think I'm getting why these motherfuckers hate me
Cause I've been putting pressure on everything lately
And I'm here pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that being said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of y'all it's no courtesy
I'm not a nest so won't none of y'all burden me
Next generation of the double R lights up
I'm the next nigga that's gon' make 'em throw they bikes up
I literally had millions watching me
On stage turning dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cash
These niggas is chickens in beef
Steady talking bout they go ham
You confused, you meat lover
I got Swizz feeling like Dre when he made Deep Cover
I'm the next Double R meal ticket
Made like a deck of cards nigga, deal with it


My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull on the Phantom when you see a don in it
Glove box you might see the Quran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong with it?
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relay my bars and remastered every one
Nigga's wondering where the fuck Drag at
I'm on Twitter hitting everybody back
Drag to the dash, I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came with
If I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change shit
Now I'ma shine when the rain get thick nigga


All the pretty girls go round the outside
Porsche or the Range Rover, meet me in the ride
Windows all jet black you ain't gotta hide
Donnie, Razor Ramone, Bobby Backlund
This my throne cranberry silver patron, they love me
Hat back like I'm 15 face clean
Nice blue jeans sitting on the Louie
I used to run base and I don't mean ???
A long way from Dr Jays and Conways
I still like hoodrats, some Beyonces
Pop off you ain't ever seen AK's
Top down, Eddie Levert and the O'Jays
Donnie killing that UFO
It took a little while but Donnie gon' blow
Hater's seen Sheek nope, Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll


Ayo, personally I think I'm underrated if nothing else
Ask around, they'll tell you Jada is something else
Motherfuck who they know
It's the kid with the diesel bars and  flow
It's a couple dudes I ain't got rid of yet
But it ain't no rush, niggas is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it's time for the blood to get spilled
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed
Hustler, artist, CEO
On the low blowing strawberry Kiwi dro
Sling cane til they cut off my hands, other than that
I'ma spit pain til they cut off my glands
Got work all over the stove, getting money all over the globe
In the Range all over the road
Cribs and the whips is lavish
Double R mob life, Kiss a savage


You know me, playing 'Kiss and Ne-Yo with your bitch
Or she can call time, run a trio on your bitch
Shoot 'em in the mouth, bet you he ain't gonna snitch
Fucking with 3 bad niggas
Telling your girlfriend to tea bag niggas
She's wavy, we crazy
ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money, mansion, Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, OG's, crack babies
Loading up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine avocado, salad with the lamb and
Cilantro head honcho, rocking a poncho
Way out in Mexico
10 for the bird let you place the decimal
Turn your ass vegetable


You the next nigga, well, I'm the X nigga
Name still ringing bells so fuck the rest nigga
I do this shit for real, y'all niggas is acting
I'm old school like Andre the giant and Bob Backlund
Cats ain't never been able to ever
Fuck with the dog, whatever the weather
I come through, niggas bow down like Muslims praying
I'm just trying to understand what these fools are saying
Don't make me, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it came down to, fuck outta here
Cats gotta fear a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to AZ
Bitch you fucking crazy, thinking Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it, as soon as soon as dog spot it

Grrr!
1 - Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know
Repeat 1
Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught, punked up like five new blocks, holding down fort
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket, he straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Out of state was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on, he didn't care
It's like slow down baby, the money ain't going nowhere
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)
You gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain
Repeat 1 (2x)
I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggas go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back
, niggas ain't built like me
And by the end, niggas was like ""Yo, why you killed Mike, D?""
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn)
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn)
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (come on)
Repeat 1 (2x)
Listen, money is missing and it's hectic (what?)
Found the safe, checked it, shit looks detected (what?)
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh)
But money talks and most niggas is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
, 
threw in a full clip
Pumped myself up,
 
cause I can't go for that bullshit
 (come on)
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Thinkin back for niggas in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a ho, then he hit me with the sob story (come on)
The famous ""Oh you didn't know I got robbed!"" story (come on)
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be Willy (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly (yeah)
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys (uh)
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grand will always be there, just never go against it

Sometimes I wonder why I like to shout
Sometimes I wonder what the lies are 'bout
Sometimes I see things I shouldn't have seen
Sometimes I wonder why I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I get on that bullshit and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's your man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, if you ain't with it
Sometimes the pain is too much to bear
Sometimes it rains too much to care

Goodbye,Year of the Dog... Again,2006.0,"Let us pray for those that we've lost
We know that we miss them for selfish reasons
Oh Lord my God, indeed you I put my trust
Save me, from all them that persecute me
And deliver me, in Jesus name, GRRRRR

Cause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

I'mma say goodbye today, cause I don't know when
We gon' cross paths again, until then
I'mma be that, and see that, speaks the truth
Believe that, I'mma see that, to reach the youth
My suffering will not be in vain (NOT)
Neither will yo' pain ever since you passed to hear yo' name
Rest in peace to Autumn - we all know cancer cells kill
But if they caught 'em, they could've fought 'em
If you'd still be here, right here with us
We'd have plenty time before death came to get us
BUT, what is death like?  Should I really care?
After looking at it, was life really fair?
Did you burn any bridges?  Did you make amends?
Did you ask God for forgiveness for your sins?
What is Heaven like?  If you could come back, should you?
If you could communicate for a moment there, would you?
... Just questions that we ask ourselves, every day (wanna know)

Cause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

So young, so gifted
Direction of life was uplifted, when the wind shifted
And took a turn for the worse, with the blessing come the curse
A nigga stressing took the dog into the hearse
My nigga Divine was way too young to die
Fell out the nest and was way too young to fly
But that didn't stop fate from happening
Idle time make the Devil—HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
God no!  Why did it go that way?
Coming from his fans away, why did he go that day?
Lightly, I dare say, life goes on
Donuts, Trey and Jerz I say, please be strong
He was supposed to be on the road with me
I wish somebody WOULD'VE came to get me
And niggas would've had to hit ME
But until then, MY FRIEND
I'mma say goodbye today, cause you never know when

Cause we all go anyway, I'mma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'mma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'mma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

Goodbye today, I'mma say goodbye today
Goin away hey (uhh) goodbye today, I'mma say goodbye today
(It's okay) And I say (let us pray)
Goodbye today (and I say) say goodbye today
Go on your way (and I say when you're, gone) I'mma say goodbye today
I'mma say goodbye today (gotta say before you move on) HEY!
Yes (yeah!)
I mean, this is life (yeah, say goodbye)

Hey
Oogh
Aaaghoo

Get up and try again
You gotta get up and try again
What you gon' do
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you gon' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

We make the moves that break the rules
A fool and his money are soon parted
So we take from fools
If and when you ever fall down just get back up
Drop something, stop frontin', pick that shit back up
Stand for something or fall for everything
Wait for the right pitch and miss with every swing
In the absence of the truth, bullshit prevails
So what they did? Fucked around, threw truth in jail
The objective is to keep you blind
So along with the handcuffs on your arm they got shackles on your mind
Seek and ye shall find (come on)
Accepting failure is the only crime (what)
Fall down eight time and get up nine

Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)

When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

Plenty a times a nigga slipped and fell
Got right back up
Slipped and fell
Got up again
Slipped and fell
One time I didn't get up as quick as I did before
It was hard as shit gettin' up off that floor (real talk)
You want the raw?
Ain't even about that
It's about when opportunity knocks
How you goin' be on the ground and expect to answer the door
No matter how hard a nigga goin' through it
You get up
You better stand up like shit
I know I'm goin' do it
Don't disrespect
Any support from fake friends cause what you do with fake friends is figure if you done 'em wrong, make amends
Walk your own
Don't let 'em walk you
And every once in awhile it's okay

Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do?
When the shit don't go just like you want it to go
Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
What you goin' do
When it don't go through just like you want it to

Everyday we walk these dogs, we walk through the fog and
One day where you walk, we'll put you up in the morgue (check it)
The road was rough, but I'm built for it
And when shit get tough that's real
Make every move the strongest one
Get down to go hard
Cause the last 'll be the longest one
We know the difference between right and wrong so don't mix it
And if it ain't broke, don't fix it
If it ain't smoke, don't twist it
I just hit y'all niggas with a jewel right there
But most of y'all missed it (Check it)
You fall out, get the fuck back up, try it again

Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)

You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)

Yo, 
Ain't nothin' too big for the lord
All you gotta do is have faith
Fall down, get back up and try again
That's all you can do
Accepting defeat is a sin

Get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)
You gotta get up and try again ('Cause I'm 'a win)

Never take a man's life 'cause you hate yours

Never forget where you from someone will remind you
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift
And never sleep on a nigga unless that nigga stiff
Never turn your back on a nigga you don't trust
Never turn your gat on a nigga and don't bust
Never expect to get away with the same shit more than twice
Never forget you could get it too for a price
Never bring it to a nigga if you scared to die
Never gonna do it -- if you scared to drive

GAME:If you could do it and it was legal, and there was no repercussions for knocking Zimmerman out, why not?

It's not really about that for me because, again, the Trayvon Martin story was sad enough. Justice needs to be served for his mother and his father and his family. I just think that how Zimmerman is playing it and being a media whore and looking for all this attention that he shouldn't be getting...If there's a chance to box him then I want in.

The Born Loser,The Born Loser/Catching The Same Hell ,1992.0,"The born loser, not because I choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters used to like me but now they call me ""homie""
Used to have a family, now I'm out on my own
Had to scrap with a pit because I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me ""kill pretty"" because I'm mad ugly
I used to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I gets none so I gotta beat my dick
Times are hard in the ghetto, I gotta steal for a living
Eating turkey-flavored Now & Laters for Thanksgiving
If that ain't enough, life is rough I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter because they said I smelled a
Little like the living dead and looked like Helter Skelter
My clothes are so funky, they're bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by themself
Even when I was little nothing went my way
I got beat up and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got Z's
But for those who choose to snooze
Cause I was born with no hope, I got nothing to lose

Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

The born loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they didn't really have to
Leave my black ass there until the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showing through my back cause I haven't had a meal
In a week, you can see bones in my hands
The raccoons beat me to the garbage cans
I'm starving Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carving is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytimes I dream of a Manwich
But all I'm really eating is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know, that's two pieces of bread strapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born Loser caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame


The Born Loser, yeah, that used to me my M-O
When I couldn't get a soul to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face until I started jamming them
I'm behind the doors now and I'm the one slamming them
I did what I had to to get where I got
Though I'll admit what I had to do was a lot
I gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catching vics just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute and didn't care who knew
Mess around, get in my way and I'll bag you, too
Cause I was born to lose straight from the beginning
In the dugout because I struck out the first inning
Winning was everything, that's why I had to
Ask my man to find the loot, and he said ""I'd be glad to""
Now who needs a major label? We got our own
I'm the Divine Master of the Unknown
Ain't nothing changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocked I just answered the door
Criminal at heart even though I don't show it
I was always a winner but I just didn't know it",https://genius.com/Dmx-the-born-loser-lyrics
The Prayer IV,The Great Depression,2001.0,"Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray... bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin' good... too proud
And still you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin' it back
That's somethin' new to me, so I'm askin' you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I do!
I guess what I'm askin' is: show me how to stand for you
And I will rap for you, sing for you, preach for you, teach for you, reach for you
I will love you like you love me: unconditionally
And I will always be prepared for whatever the mission'll be
Give the nutrition to me, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, before I go, let me give
Thanks to you Lord, for my birth, for every day that I've lived
You gave me a love most of my life I didn't know was there

Shuttin' down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what them niggas call me, cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my mother fucking balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh wit' 'em
Blood bath went I let the fuckin' rap hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook
Taken out over a dirty look
I bag niggas, but niggas with trash  shot dead
You're only takin' a fuckin' thing from me but hot lead
You know my style faggot, cause I'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'
""Police,"" but you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man, and a lot mo' grease
All I gets is pounds, niggas want none of this
Back streets are like track meets cause I be runnin' this

Ain't nowhere to run (cause I be runnin' this)
Ain't nowhere to hide (come on)
Ain't nowhere to go (cause I be runnin' this)
Reaper saved your soul (come on)

Surrounded by the colors, I see crimson, black and blue (come on)
Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you (straight up, mother fucker)
Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew (come on)
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do? (straight up)
System of the universe, selecting me in time (come on)
I'm falling down upon the earth, and singing truth in rhyme (come on)
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm through (come on)
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you (Dirt Dog in effect)

How many lightning bugs do it take to light up a fucking moon?
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me
We don't need it, it gets more ugly
Bitches was tryin' to bust their ass
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name

I’m Gonna Crawl,Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (Soundtrack),2000.0,"Live and learn
Life's a lesson (life is a lesson)
And I'm the teacher

First I'm gonna crawl, uh (crawl)
Then I'm gonna walk, uh huh (walk)
Then I'm gonna stand, uh huh (stand)
Then I'm gonna talk, uh (talk)
What I gotta learn, what (learn)
In order to teach, (teach)
Then I gotta burn (burn)
In order to reach (reach), my nigga

Yo, I see what I see, day by day
Hopin that the Lord can, pave my way
Have I been forgotten, have I forsaken
Or maybe I'm just wrong with the moves that I've been makin
Hatin others cuz they hate me, over envy
Wanna send me, when we used to be friendly
Think I started off on top? With two platinum albums?
Naw dog, I started off on the block
I just did shit to get shit
Niggas always knew I was down to hit shit
That's why I stay wit shit
Played with shit, but it wasn't a game
First time locked down, wasn't the same
A whole new world, nothin but clothes to steal
Niggas gettin split for real, miss a good meal
They ain't call nobody, cuz don't nobody care
They got my back against the wall, fuck it I'm just here

First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

Dog it's like this, when the fog is type thick
A nigga might flip, and a nigga bite quick
But I stay focused on what's important
Supportin my family, fuckin with my dogs and recording
According to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems
So you, stop worryin about theirs
I'm long time ago, look awake, cuz he'll leave you
I hear none, speak none, see none, evil
All I can do is teach you, what I know
How I flow, how I get down, where I go
Maybe what I been through, will send you
Somewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window
I love my people, all of my people
And God gon keep me callin my people
You gots to live life to the fullest
It ain't always about the size of the gun, sometimes it's the bullet

First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

Every day we live and learn, take it step by step
And we create our own path, until there's no life left
I hold my death, off for as long as I can
Knowin my man, is plottin with the chrome in his hand
Supposed to be fam, but niggas get shady over money
My nigga, pull out the 380 over money
Crazy over money, can't do without it
I got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it
It's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first
Because he comes with the thirst of a nigga that had it the worst
It's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he gripped it
Got a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted
Gotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it
It was there from the start, I just hope you spot it
Cuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper
Words to live by will leave a hole in the paper

First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)",https://genius.com/Dmx-im-gonna-crawl-lyrics
Sucka for Love,Undisputed,2012.0,"Doing me like you do, cause I know that's what you do (x 5)

Never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know

You ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know

Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut

Listen boo, you’s a bitch, you been a bitch
You know how niggas do
Run up in a bitch, fuck her well
And the bitch, you call them bitches
But then in a week or 2, fucking all them bitches
A nigga gotta fall back and take a breather
Shorty suck a mean dick but in the morning
Gotta leave her, wasn't trying to deceive her
I just wanted my dick sucked
She cute as a motherfucker
And she got a big butt
Now I'm like, what do I do from here
Cause she’s acting like she ain’t trying go nowhere
I ain't really trying to get attached to this bitch
Shit it's friday, I just want some ass in the bitch
Can’t be mad at me, I'm just doing what niggas do
Got kids by him, and you wanna be a nigga's boo? What!? Really!?
Oh you think it’s like that?
Ok! I’ll be right back

I ain't never been a sucker for love

You ain’t never been nothing but a nut

It was summer time, I was in the slumps
Seen that chick from before, I was like wassup
Remember me? I was that kid
It was you, her and me, we just did what we did
How you expect me to respect you
When I know a police file of other niggas that you gave your sex to
I ain’t never been a sucker, so if you think so
You got the wrong motherfucker
What’s my name? Ah ah, bitch! What’s my name?
You know what the fuck it is
I’m a real nigga, that’s gonna handle his


I like the way you beat hits, oooh, that's that street shhh
Shorty can you keep a secret? (""Yes..."")
You know what I’m trying to creep with
Come on, cars outside, hotels up the block

Uhhh...aha..

Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid
Niggas can't touch me kid

Ain't no way for me to say just how deep the flow gets
Still waking up in cold sweats, over old threats
And I done did more time than a clock
From the Valhalla to the Rock
I represent on every block
Its the Dizark! Straight out the Grizound!
And from now on this is how Shizits going Dizown!
Clizown, come through squashing toes
Don't even breathe cause in jail you was washing clothes
Get in front of hoes and start fakin' G, let you tell it you getting dough like a bakery
Making me Schemin plots at yo, ass like to dream I put that head to bed and you can dream a lot!
Funny shit is before I shot tha nigga, you shoulda seen how the bitch came up out tha nigga!
Now I got the nigga but I could run up in 'em made 'em say ""Daddy"" before I put the gun up in 'em
Put one up in 'em, two three, empty the clip
Have his whole head looking like a busted lip
And I skip, cause I can't stand another case
Went to his wake so I could laugh at the look on his mother's face
Even though I know it ain't shit funny about knocking a nigga off just to get money
I still do what I gots to and just be grateful that I never got you cause I woulda SHOT YOU!


Yeah, you know how I'm living nigga
Straight up ruthless, let's leave yo man toothless, ain't nothing given nigga
I been cruddy cause just long as I can remember since 1970 the 18 of December
Earl Simmons, the bastard that nobody wanted was born
Niggas showed me a joint made 'em run it, it's on
Can't a bank around the way say I ain't stuck it
Quick as I catch a body I can be one, so fuck it!
I ain't got shit to lose but my life
Plug you in the gut and watch the blood ooze down my knife
I laugh at death cause to me it's funny
Don't give a fuck about shit, what matters to me is money!
Sonny, I could teach yo ass a trick or two about stacking the dough, macking a hoe and what the dick'll do
I drove a bitch until the bitch is worthless
Have her sucking my mans dick and make it look good on the surface
A nigga get the same treatment
I'm leaving guts on walls, and brains all over the cement
But no remorse for the corpse cause I still kick 'em
He ain't bleeding enough so I stick 'em
And I will have another body
Kinda like how I feel when I'm blowing up another party
And shit is cracking in the hood now so I'm good now
Talking bout you good now
Oh, you would? How?


Plenty of niggas know dirty is how I do 'em
Push buck shots from a 30 right through 'em
Cause ain't none of ya'll motherfuckers built for war
And I lay down the law when I spray down ya door
Fuck around and my name'll be 19 5 be 64 11
On the 3 and a half to 7
But even up north I put niggas to waste so if you wanna stop the violence
GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE!
Paroled in four, peeps hit the board off
Bitches is fucking but I sleeps with the sawed off!
I got shit to do, crews to break, moves to make
Wait for the news to break, I got dues to take
I don't joke cuz jokers is cards
And cards are what I pull
Infrared with the clip full, no leash on my pitbull
This shit is hot like the wax off a candle stick
But how I handle shit, is to dismantle shit (Dundundundunduhdada)
Like Popeye and it's spinach time, running through niggas like your tape at the finish line
What ya crew gonna do when I put the pressure on?
And it hurts wanna be gangstas in skirts?
And the bitch is coming all up out the nigga!
One false move and they mom's will read about the nigga
And they girls will be without the nigga
Matter fact, I'm tired of talking money throw ya joints up, let's scrap

""Can't touch me kid...word up...
Can't touch me kid...word up...
They can't touch me kid!
Word like can't touch me kid
Word to mans can't touch me kid
Cuz I get big can't touch me kid
Cuz that's how it is can't touch me kid
I lives how I lives can't touch me kid
Fresh off a bid can't touch me kid
Get the body and slid can't touch me kid
Yo I did what I did can't touch me kid

Like I shoulda did your peoples before they could conceive you
How's a buck-fifty sound, for a quick ass cut?
I'll have a flashback, I fuckin blow your bitch-ass up

How you want it? Punk bitch talkin junk bitch
Fuck around and you'll be found in a trunk bitch

And I got mo' skills to show my fo' kills, my fuckin blow grills
Got some cold shit, have you like - ""Oh shit!"" Don't laugh money

With one hit, watch the dum-dum split this bum's shit

Where yo' guns at? Run that, see a nigga thirst
Been there, done that

And I keep somethin that'll hit if I miss
One thing a nigga stay with is hot shit
Got this, what you cats want? Not this
I constantly gots to remind young niggas
Uh-uhh, don't do that, some niggas
Think cause I ain't killed a nigga this week
That shit is sweet
Fuck around, you'll be dead in the street
Red with a sheet, over the corpse
Shit is deep, so I shed a tear, over the loss
If you creep, then you niggas'll roll with the force

Till the dead and gone
It's on!
What ya'll really want?!

I'mma let life be my song

How I live is simple
Walk through the streets
Talk to the beats
New York! I'mma eat
I never had a problem with surviving
No problem with getting down, busting my guns, or ruff rydin'
Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My shits for real cause I'm that nigga
The reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the lord, no body else can solve them(?)
See what I see but look through my eyes
The devil is a liar the truth never lies
We all got issues
Shit that we go thru
Shit that we been thru
Shit that we won't do
The pain that we bring upon ourself
For no reason, is the worst!
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me
And in the process, I lost my soul
Damn! the devil got a hold
In my mind, I'm like a little boy
Lost in crime
Like the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying
The lord knows I'm trying
But at the same time
You hear the nigga with the weight of the world!
Why you gave it to Earl?

And I'm living it up
Face everyday chin up
I ain't giving it up
Cause if I ain't giving a fuck
The who will?!
So I hope for the best
Knowing that its all uphill
Sometimes I wonder what's lifes about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out
And no doubt, the fate in mine is blind
So whatever, fuck it, I'mma roll out
We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far
Dont know what to say, when you talking
Dont know who you gone see, when you walking
If you dont know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you dont know gonna get you hurt!

Till the dead and gone

Blown Away,Year of the Dog... Again,2006.0," (DMX)
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (yes)
Like the wind blow

Yea, uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I'd come through and if niggas was broke I took watches and cellulars
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets
 (DMX)
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Blooooooooooooooown

I had a ""S"" on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other times I came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
I bag some niggas I knew and some niggas I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
I'm a cruddy niggas out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game we'll play let's get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart beat stop
Shut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but it's to late
Cause I'm a hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be something that you ate
 (DMX)
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Blooooooooooooooown

If pain is love, why hide my pain with drugs?
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes, no soap or shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
Like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is (unknown)
And a model bitch sitting with a head up in my lap
But since no dough don't spin
(unkown)
It's obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let 'em blow at the wind

Like the wind
God will take
All my sins
Blown away
Like the wind
Like the wind

Love That Bitch,Undisputed,2010.0,"Hey you see
This the shit, I be talkin 'bout, know'msayin?
When you don't know, what the fuck is really good know'msayin?
You feel one way, but you know you gotta walk the other way

Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggas like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!!""

Aiyyo it's like this man, shorty got a kid
On some drunk after the club shit, we done did
All these bitches got me hittin the Remy, full throttle
By the time I finish the bottle them bitches is models
Let me break it down like this, here's what happened
I was y'know, tryin to fuck and, once I get to rappin
We at the crib, bitches leave they panties on the doorknob
Puff somethin, ten minutes later we on the floor hard
AH! AH! Huffin and puffin
She screamed it more cause she can't get enough of the lovin
Now, look where it got us, nine months later
Baby is born and I'm realizin I hate her
 - 2X

""YOU DON'T GOTTA CHILL WITH HER!"" Man, they don't know
I'm still with her cause I'm tryin to see the baby grow
That's just the pops in me, see I ain't never had one
And now that I am a father I don't wanna be a bad one
As shorty get older, how do I explain
That I really can't stand his mother? She a pain!
And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate
It was those two bottles of Remy, plus it was gettin late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin to do or to blame
Man I'm the Dog, bitches stay screamin my name
She knew it was a fuck thing, she ain't my wife
So why I gotta pay for her for the rest of my life?
 - 2X

Child support? You're killin me! But it gets worse
Moms got a thirst that'll get her put in a hearse
Some say it's like a curse, the way she got me locked down
It feel like I'm trapped and I'm tryin to get out now
From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat 'til the Dog got full
Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do
Bust it~! From the beginnin you had my mind goin
Look forward to seein you every time knowin
Couldn't see shit cause, love was blind
Fuck it, that liquor is what gets you blind
REAL TALK!

I'mma take it back to the shit talkin' slick talkin'
Slap a nigga and call him my bitch and keep walkin'
HALF Y'ALL niggas is pussy
The other half of y'all niggas is fake thugs so please don't push me
If we was in jail you'll be in the bullpen under mad pressure
Leave you up on the stretcher nigga I'm gon test you try your hand
When they carry you out I'mma tie your man
But these cats ain't built like your killed like
Blood gets spilled like poke a nigga tonight
Bang bang HA! It hurts
The fuck you screemin' on me for I'm puttin' in work
We leave more bodies then the bloods and crips
This is how it's goin' down nigga thuggin' a bitch
Fuck a nigga wit we on the same bullshit y'all niggas on lets get it on
 
You know how we roll nigga bring the noise
Y'all don't wanna fuck with them boys
Come on dog put away them toys

No matter how many cats he brought wit'um I'mma split'um
Hair raised on my back get low and hit'um
Stoped him dead in his tracks
Knowning damn well he don't mean what he said in his raps
Dogs don't know nothin' but bust that nigga
Dogs don't nothin' but fuck that nigga
Dogs don't know nothin' but suck my dick
When it comes to what happened dogs don't know shit
Did two years in one night
I popped two peers in one fight
Two ears in one light, aiight, aiight
That's what it is follow
Too many dick riding niggas wanna swallow
Follow my mans and them
And get popped with yo mans and them is what Im handin' them
It's hot things, drop things, stop things, drop things
Cook a nigga like hot wings
 

Been around the block did my dirt
Earl thorough as in thorough, put in work till it hurt
I've seen less pussy in a stripe club fuckin' with y'all niggas
Yes that means all y'all niggas
Most y'all cats don't know what ruthless means
Will you be able to survive the truth I've seen
Cats would'nt be alive if you was on my team
But the truth is the ride is rough ya mean
Got me like GOD what the fuck
Dog gon bang somebodys getting' stuck
Back up the truck jump right the fuck out on niggas
Empty the five out on niggas
Hush muthafuckas don't you cry
Dog gonna make sure that you die
Point blank range so the slug go through
Then I'mma hit yo crib and pop yo family too NIGGA!!

Popping shots like corks in niggas, sticking forks in niggas
Cause they done, only reason y'all still breathing is cause y'all run
When we bust shots, my nigga clutch Glocks
Right in front of precents fuck cops
Niggas want pops then they die for them
Kiss the barrel, cry for them
Spirt leave your body touch the sky for them
Fuck voltron see what me and mines form
In the nine storm, death times gone
I'm that cat that y'all niggas got your eyes on
Go to papi broke trying to get your pies on
The day that I'm gone I'm real fuck stardom
Niggas wanna talk but they don't want no problems


All y'all niggas want is your heart back dog you pussy
Acting like you really wanna bark back don't push me
Only room enough for one dog to hold the shit down
You cowards know it now i'ma hold it down
When I'm done close it down
It's my shit here, FUCK that nigga just say try shit where
Come on cupcake y'all cats ain't even built like that
I been seen through they bullshit I'm real like that
I know how to walk the dog, I know how to chase the cat
I know how to get a bone, I know how to bring it back
I know how to flip on a nigga split him with the bat
I know how to train a pup to make sure they scratch
You motherfuckers don't want no problems cause my revolver is solving them
One by one until it's all of them
Let that be a lesson to your mans and shit
Keep your fucking mouth shut if your mans want spit, nigga


Well it's the kid that a

Y'all know that cake mix but y'all don't wanna taste this shit
Guns I should've been arrested for
Y'all gone make my bullets expand like a lesspee jaw
Don't you test me boy
Don't fuck with X or Drag to the dash
Cause once you dump in these bags you drag to the trash
Dumpster amoung the rest of them fags
My poker got your skin looking like acupunctures
Keep a silence on the tip can't afford the noise
My banger got a jagged edge like them four boys
If your hot i'll super soak you, won't be able to dry it off
Just relax take you last breath and die it off
Nothing but love I spread
But if you take advantage the weight that's lead will rush your head
You sweat'll die your hair red, like my bitch Eve

Tales from the Darkside,Rap Sheet,2000.0,"And now, the tale from the darkside...

Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas
What the flow is all about
Huh, its about this
Anywhere from forty-eight and up
Straight, you feel me?
Fifty fifty
Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight?
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me)
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't wanna make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
'Cuz what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
Thats why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme
And thats mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, thats what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit 
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man
Then we gon' see what'choo made of
If your shit ain't pumpin Kool-Aid, what you afraid of?
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin my groove on, 'cuz that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you
Niggas try their luck with you, 'cuz they smell ass
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME
On this real, thats why a nigga stay writin
'Cuz kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cuz I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'mma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block
From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wide
Cell cagers last night from lock out just died?
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game
'Cuz I'mma flowed off more tracks than they sixth train
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth

It's funk flex,  DMX (x4)
Straight Y.O. mother fuckers

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you not me, got me? and you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about ""dog I wanna be just like you""
How about you wanting to be just like you?
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride dick every f**kin' day (i-ight? )
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woohee

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets?
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the lord, we can see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
A lot of good things will go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Ayo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go forth, do what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woo hee

Like fuck it, you wanna be me? here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch turn into a killer
Don't carry shottie
'cause the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

Do you - 'cause what it boils down to it's true
Do you - 'cause you are held accountable for you
Do you - is that really what you want me to see
Do you - 'cause I'mma do me, truley, woo-hee",https://genius.com/Dmx-do-you-lyrics

Man, loose lips with those thighs (Uh)
Couldn't just let her walk by (right), I ain't a thirsty nigga
But right about now my throat was gettin real dry
Shoo this shit, had to be the cutest bitch
I seen in a long time and I don't do this shit, like
Runnin up on hoes, what up ma, I'm X
Cause you know how this goes, come on ma, I'm X
We just chill, sat and talk to the first light
And for the first time I didn't fuck on the first night
And it was aight, shorty was a thorobred
Like ""Belly"", we ain't fuck, she just gave me head, for real

From the time that the sun is up
Till the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter babe
There's no love like the dog love
There's no love, it's dog love

No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter cause
There's no love like the dog love
I got my dog love, got my dog love baby

I run with shorty, pass off the gun to shorty
Do whatever gots to be done with shorty, straight like that
When I hit her like ""I'll be right back""
Yo, I'll be right back, ain't no bullshittin, I'll be right back
She got a nigga catchin feelings, I'm a street nigga hard body
But, she got me catchin feelings
Man, those eyes, those lips
Be like damn, those thighs, those hips
She like ""blam"", make a nigga have to touch somethin (For real)
Not necessarily fuck somethin, as long as I touch somethin (For real)
A nigga blood boil when I see another nigga holla (WHAT)
Don't make me have to pop a nigga in his fuckin collar


Aiyyo, shit is goin to smooth (Uh)
Since Stella got a new groove (Yeah) it's like we got somethin to prove
We gon' make it, rain or shine
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Like Eve said, ""Love Is Blind"" (Come on), right about now
I can't see shit cause you always on my mind
Been like that, since I met her, had to have her so I went to get her
But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty ridin it out, we out


All I want is you in my life
All I got is you in my life
All I need is you in my life

Don't be stupid you heard what I said mutha fucka
Who shot u ohhh nigga like u don't know
Stickin you for your doe while I'm fuckin your broke ho

Cuz I don't give a fuck G I'll get u touched B
I got choice ripple my slug'll take apart a door
And enuf crazy niggas behind me to start a war
So what u want nigga help me is about your best
When I'm finished Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothin but make u look a little thicker
Cuz in the dark u ain't nothin but a lil nigga
But if you've been thinkin about that shit u did
You wouldn't have brought the joint wit u kid
Now I might have to get u kid and split your wig wit a machedi
I bring beef to niggas and string them out like spaghetti
U ain't ready lord can u stand how I'm bringin it
I'm givin it is how I'm livin it so I'm swingin it
Red dot on your head cuz you's in mid range
Red dot on your chest opens up your rib cage
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!! Uhhh!
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so I gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor

Ain't never been a nigga to discuss my fame (WHAT?!)
Fuck my fame, nigga, what's my name? (WHAT?!)

Never one to be taken lightly or softly
Dog, I don't know you please back the fuck up off me

So don't walk too fast or talk too much
Cause y'all niggas is ass, and you know whassup
Cause y'all niggas'll blast and we like WHAT?!
And my niggas'll blast and Y'ALL FUCKED UP!

Now who's lookin at me, akwardly? My man
But you know who I let talk to me? My fans
Take pictures shake hands cause, that's my man

Be careful where you walkin cause the ground's real shaky

You Could Be Blind,The Great Depression,2001.0,"You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life

Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with ""Oh, you ain't got?""
Well here, take my shirt
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'mma keep my paws on what's mine
Beg 'til I find
Strapped 'til I'm blind
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, cause this is mine, you scared shitless
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
Some of you niggas, form a following, but you startin' to forget
I paid my dues, not only did you not wear
But you would really love it
If you could meet that cat that made my shoes
C'mon!


Now see, what I do is peep shit, keep shit low
Keep paying attention to what you trying to show me
Livin', but you never know, we livin'
Don't give me what you don't owe me
Don't tell me that you love me
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always looking for bad, look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(Aight) I'm a thoro nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, ""Yo, that's my dog""
To, ""Yeah, that nigga dead""
What the fuck is all this?
News to me
Dog it's like shit ain't what it used to be
See some niggas choose to be on the other side of the fence
Keep riding with this, get fried in the mix
C'mon!


Now if it ain't that, then don't say that
Cause I don't play that, y'all play that
But the poke ain't black, damn, why you say that?
I thought that...what?
Nevermind, I just thought it
We supposed to keep it real
I destroy what I was taught
Misery, love, company
Now you niggas talikin' 'bout jumpin' me, pumpin' me
Full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
Damn, I just gave, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Trying to take a nigga's stripes
Live life through life, and so on and so on
That's when the grow on, man, get your flow on
You niggas gettin' too old for this kid shit
On the real, we all done did shit to get shit
Snake shit, right is right, wrong is wrong
Muh'fucker, listen to this song
You see what shit I'm on
C'mon!",https://genius.com/Dmx-you-could-be-blind-lyrics
I Get Scared,Undisputed,2012.0,"[Intro: Rachel Taylor + (

I... I get scared... when it comes (
When it comes
)
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared... when it comes (
When it comes
)
And I know I'm gonna be alright

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

Y'all don't know things I know
Where I've been and where I go
Y'all don't know 'cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you let me be me
Y'all don't know the pain I felt
Or, how I played the cards I was dealt
Y'all don't know what you're talkin' about
Y'all need to stop runnin' your mouth

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

I get down for real, all I know is one way
Sunday to Sunday, only game is gunplay
And I know that one day, I'm gon' get it
Until I get it, I'm gon' get it
We gets it in like a fat bitch cookin'
Like a nosy bitch that's lookin'
Been had the gauge huntin', since the age 11
Niggas think you on stage, you frontin' - look here
I'm that nigga, if I knock on your door
You gon' look in my eyes and be like, ""Dog, what's wrong?""
You feel it like I feel it, there's somethin' in the air
Wait, c'mere, yeah it's comin' from right there

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when you're gone
And I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

I know they love me real, so why pretend
Make a nigga take it back to where it all began
I mean, even we went, yeah it's that bad
Don't let me catch you slippin', yeah I'm that mad
When the Dog do when there's no cats to chase
I'm sure there's somethin' else and try to take off his face
Yeah you was in the wrong place, at the wrong time
I'm takin' everything you got, I want it, all mine
How a nigga gon' stop me when, I don't stop for signs
Yeah you got mine, but don't start lyin'
Understand a nigga tryin', but don't stop it from happenin'
But I guess they won't GET IT, until I start clappin'",https://genius.com/Dmx-i-get-scared-lyrics

Thinkin the Dog don't got it!

But you 'bout to find out, what it is, C'MON!

They call me, go against the grain, the swagger's reckless
Since 12 smack a nigga, grab his necklace
And the nigga gon' respect this, 
Dog come through like Deebo
Ain't gotta touch his life but gettin paid off C-lo
That's yo' man faggot, he know, go hard and get down
Whenever Dog hit town, I shut shit down
But I want it NOW, if I see it, I'mma take it
And you better hope I don't want it all cause, I'll leave you naked
I ain't never had to fake it, Dog come through with no gun
I'll show son, I'm scared of no one, and I don't run
I tell niggas, X is back
And it ain't where I'm at, it's what I'm givin niggas, X is back
C'MON!


They on that peep Dark whisperin, walk soft shit
I'm a dog, course I recognize a bitch
And I ain't speak cause I was actin funny nah, it's not what I'm about
You just look mad different without a fuckin dick in your mouth
Soon as I seen you I knew you was see-through, cause I seen through
I ain't mean to, he made me hit him, that's what the thing do
If we were big as our hearts you'd be, half my size
I only fuck with the real Scarface and Nas
Niggas love to think the worst - but put
What you think in this hand a pile of shit in the other, which one'll get filled up first?
I stay remindin niggas what the gun do
Wherever I'm at niggas don't come through, if they do they run through (c'mon!)


(It ain't my fault) that on the mic, y'all niggas suck
(It ain't my fault) when shots go off, y'all niggas duck
(It ain't my fault) real niggas run in circles around you
(It ain't my fault) did the dirt but now the dirt found you


Niggas is fuckin blind!
Lookin without seein
Walkin without bein
Livin without breathin

When I Come thru Everything gon' Stop

Now move.. move.. move.. move..

X comes thru the hood, like here comes trouble
Year of the dog again, first week double
Low in the rider, east coast nigga
Fo' in the rider, street loc nigga
Far from jiggie but like biggie bitches call me big poppa
I got a big dick and I'd a pop her
Yea the kid talk shit but the kid don't front
How ever shit go ""Give 'Em What They Want""
I ain't signing shit, love my fans
But Cross this line with the camera in your hands
Cause it could get real ugly real thick
And you like this nigga ???? real quick
Motherfuckin' right, I ain't got time for the small talk
One of us has got to go down, we can't all walk
You know this as well as I do
But I promise you, I'm go hide you and no one will find you

Stop nigga, hold up, you know I don't quit
You see I'm back and I'm comin' to smash your shit
And ahhla back with the god and bus-a-bus nigga
This time I'm Bringin' the shovel so I can come and dig another grave
For all of you bustards what the fuck you think you doin'
I'll put a stop to your function and anybody movin'
And then I'll fuck up production and any crew you flew in
You ain't with me, you against me, The loser side you chosen
Anyway, word to ears, you niggas know I ain't finished
I'll Fuck up every hood, and I'm back to handle my business
You niggas thinking you though like you ate a can of spinach
In till we mash on you faggots and make you change up your image
Flip mode in this bitch, Ruff Ryders is with me
You see we back on the block and yes, we runnin' the city
Now you niggas know the flow less ain't controlin' the committee
Nothing' should be movin' unless my crew in it, you fell me

If there is money involved, I want half
Niggas is funny to watch, go head laugh
Ain't nothing to smile about
For real dog, all niggas is wildin' out
Niggas who pound you out
We found you out in distance
Leg missin', head missin'
Something like 28 days missin'
And you know how the dessert do a nigga
Brake you down quick, residue a nigga
Can't stop the flow, Niggas stop and go
But whenever I drop, a million out the door
Y'all niggas know, X is not to be fucked with
Y'all run around on some dumb shit with a slump dick
Fucking bitch, you niggas know I don't mind scrapping
When I see you I see you what ever happens, happens
This ain't just rappin', niggas talk a good one
You know what let that go, see me in the hood son

Next Out the Kennel,The Great Depression,2001.0,"Aiyyo, this is DJ Kay Slay from around the way
And my dog DMX is puttin it down with the Bloodline family
And the Bloodline kennels
THE GREAT DEPRESSION! FOURTH TIME!
X keeps it gutta and his dogs are no different
You gotta respect the line...
First out the kennel, Jynx reppin straight from Y.O. kennel
Holdin it down...

Let it be known, bring it to me
Break the fingers that you write with
Mouth that you recite with, real life shit
Niggas call me God on beats, cuz I light shit
Quicker than those, shootin big holes, rippin your clothes
Play games and have a thug nigga sittin at your home
See you walkin with that bitch when he spit at yo dome
Damn, ya brains all over the place!
Bitch cryin and screamin, cuz ya brain's all over her face!
I got love for street thugs and killers, with deep mugs
Who bust they guns first then they start to cuss
Shook niggas hold they guns till they start to rust
Bitch niggas don't want no parts of us, we dangerous
Tripped a few times off of angel dust
One shot turn yo brains to slush
Yeah, niggas don't learn shit till the lights is off...
It's too late! Now your life is lost, motherfucker!


DAMN! See what I'm sayin, this shit is real
Next out the kennel, barkin from Dirty Jerz is that nigga Loose

Let me Loose, nigga! Get the fuck off me!
I can't believe my ears! Huh? These niggas is barely on!
In fact they wack, they just got a hot song!
Fuckin up the game is catz like you
That make wack niggas think they can rap too!
But Loose at the door now, so come with me
I'mma make sure no more rappers like you get in!
You want it? We can go hard with the beats
Or hard to the body or hard to the teeth
Yeah, I was on Universal, they couldn't have me
They kept me on the hush, like Whitney drug habit!
Got drafted, then made it to the front line
A year later, got traded to Bloodline
Now it's hard for catz to keep they spot
He rock too much ice, he can't keep it hot
And when all the ice melt, they all watered down
Loose, fuck that, the streets is mines now!


FIRE! Only stray kills, yaknowhatimsayin?
Next out the kennel, my nigga Big Stan from Harlem
Get at em dog...

Uh-oh, who's next? That would be me, BS, ya know?
Uh, y'all niggas ain't ready, uh
I'm like a thieve in the night, I creep in your life
One day when you nice, high off the henny
Catch you while you partyin right
With the semi, put your body on ice, for a price
Make a bastard of your son as well as widow your wife
My struggle was tight, love inside my heart has limits
Like anything outside of Bloodline, bound to get it
We bound to win it, niggas want, we bound to give it
And anything you catz start, you know we bound to finish
Can you see the cage is open? Muzzle is off
The nine is sick, the silencer will muffle the cough
The Line is thick, Stan stay solo on cost
My shoulder will frost on any nigga other than dog
I'm the one ya moms would hate you to cross
Of course, if you the only child, who'll be replacing the lost?
Please think before you go against the B.S
And no it's not a game, I'm one of Bloodline's best, nigga!


Whoa, whoa, whoa, they just keep bitin
The last to bite, that bitch, the bitch of the litter
Crazy Kash, Kashmir, get at em girl...

What the fuck ya niggas know about grease?
I got enough to put in ya piece, plus bust ten in ya fleece
Make ya back bend in a crease, that's what you get offend a beast
You hatin me like I was a friend of Kelis
Load, cock back and release
Bad bitch crackin ya piece, bullet holes in the back of your peeps
Always catch niggas comin from the back with the heat
Love to watch they knees buckle when they smack the concrete
You ain't gotta love me, just respect the bitch!
Scared to fight me, get your girls, so I can wet the bitch!
Who gives a FUCK who ya old lady be?
I put holes in ya old lady tee if she fuckin with me!
You know my niggas Stan, Jynx, Loose, Berg and X
Ya niggas switchin occupations, cuz they heard we next
No niggas above mine, cuz no niggas above mine
And that shit's in my heart, cuz it's in my fuckin Bloodline...",https://genius.com/Dmx-next-out-the-kennel-lyrics

We in the business of service
And most of y'all should've heard this

Some us got it,and some don't
Some stand for what they believe in
And some won't
Some us do wrong with no remorse
Some of us do wrong
See the light and change course

I don't ask questions i don't need to know the answer to if at the end of the day,i know who imma answer to.there ain't none of us bigger than God.what it is:the more dirt you've been through,the bigger the scar..the more hurt you've been through,the bigger you are,and we'll see what is bigger than what you figure you are.we're all part of the plan,and try to stay at the right side of the fence(what)with the devil riding your sins.you can remember..sometimes,that's all you can remember,but it won't always be as cold as December.as dark comes to an end,they always do with the word of God.it's always true..have faith,babe!!

Where I Wanna Be,The Weigh In,2012.0,"In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
Cause I know that this is where I wanna be

Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning, my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all, but not all heard us, like sometimes i was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hating
What you think it is with me, but whats good with you lately
I hate when i sense this shit, trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
Niggas so dumb, that they don't even censor shit
You sent the shit, so I know you meant the shit you senseless bitch


Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill I know you feel when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down


If I could bottle the inspiration
I'd be a billionaire, straight fuckin villain yeah
X, baby you still in here
I feel the air, I can smell the death in it
We were all left in it, so fuck nigga, step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up (what!), i'll have you sprayed up and wet up (what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
Now look at what the fuck you got yourself into
All I did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window
That's what suckers do

So if you got guerrillas with guns, stay with 'em
Motherfucker we bang for war, we don't keep those things in drawers
When it rains it pours
Cold blooded killers, the murderers is senseless
To ID, we'll need forensics, or a dentist
Fuck with D.O.G and you will be
Straight up, D.O.A so R.I.P
Real niggas slip, but bounce right back

Scratch you to death, I'm a go getter
The rounds going, download more to Twitter
Slugs big as my finger collect 4 on your vest
And we'll still be able to play connect 4 on your chest
Or I could hit 'em in the mouth and make this bastard taste
Nothing but lead, told you I'm a basket case
You call me acid face
I spit lava, you better off smacking your father, don't bother
We're career criminals; we rob niggas
Double R for life, we mob niggas
Bitch niggas do what you do -- suck a dick
Fucking faggot, you've been off some sucker shit
Back up in your face ""up in your grill""
Getting back up in that lab with a license to kill
Tell your mans and them to chill, if they don't want what you got
They thought they was fuckin with a gangsta but you not!

All these fucking killers but the jail's full of snitches
A dollar ain't got a fucking thing to do with riches
Say cheese, now I got pictures of what a bitch is
Got a crew of guerillas, stalk niggas like roaches
Put niggas lights out, buenas noches
You can go to the left, but don't lose the focus
Whatever the fuck you do, don't lose the focus
Ain't nothing changed, niggas throw them R's up
Come through on a higher boost, light them cars up
Vatos Locos, man we are nuts
You know that's us when we tear shit up, what!?
We get's it in, no muthafucking doubt
Ain't got to pop a nigga, I punch him in his mouth
Got ya soft like funeral music, cut it out
For real, fuck is all the noise about, bitch?


If it walk like a duck, I'mma treat it like a duck
If it look like pussy, then it's gon get fucked
See, we get down for real, blam niggas from the truck
And you can keep talking slick but you don't get stuck
You cats making funny moves and I don't know what you up to
But keep talking slick and you gon' make me say fuck you
I'm a grown ass nigga
Walk alone ass nigga
Bring it to you, ain't no beefing on the phone ass nigga
Nowadays there's so much bitch in niggas
I wouldn't be surprised if there was dick in niggas (make it stop!)
They don't make 'em like they used to
But y'all better get used to
A nigga keeping it real
Just because he choose to
They know I'm in some pain because I go against the grain
Go against the game and show a nigga that thing
Throw a nigga the flame
Keep niggas up
Double R for life, we deep nigga, what!?

All my life
I've been struggling
Problems I've been juggling
But I'mma be alright
 

Man... man... man... m---
Suck a dick
What the fuck?
Fuck outta here with that bullshit, hey
Real talk
Real fucking talk man
Fuck outta here with that bullshit nigga
I'd knock 90% of these niggas the fuck out, son",https://genius.com/Dmx-time-to-get-paid-lyrics
Baby Motha,Year of the Dog... Again,2006.0,"Rapper and actor DMX along with wife pregnant wife Tashera
Showed up at the federal court in Queens Wednesday
To accept a plea agreement
Inside the courthouse, DMX signed autographs with a sketch artist over the face
As well as the fans caught off guard
By this star's appearances

My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more""
Don't even like so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
(Repeat)

My baby's motha be buggin, she wanna blast stick bitches
One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, yall niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's '05, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me liftin through that riffin shit cousin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me
You listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha


Bitches be callin the cops, thinkin they callin the shots
Takin the dude with the bag, baby it's all in the pops
And do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo
A nigga just been chillin, I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin clothes
When them bitches through, ain't to co sure when they home
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big
I ain't gon blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
Cause you my baby motha, and I'mma always hit that
 (DMX)
Give a hell what you say (You don't)
I ain't never gon go away (You won't)
I'mma stalk you till I find you (Been there)
Turn around and be right behind you (Still there)
Be in the bushes outside yo house
Just waitin for you to come out
Cause I'm a stupid bitch (I know)
A real fuckin stupid bitch (I know)
Ain't nothing but a stupid bitch


My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more""
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like ""Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck""
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck
Plus, you don't wanna be around and see what honey do
And plenty comin through, she comin through with that twenty-two
Trust me, you don't need that in your life
Oh yall bitches already know, I got a wife
You'se a stupid bitch, a real fuckin stupid bitch
You ain't nothing but a stupid bitch. Bitch!",https://genius.com/Dmx-baby-motha-lyrics

Y'all gon' make me lose my cool up in here, up in here
If I gotsta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be quick, aight
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick
And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, nine one one shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, 'cause everytime
You come around, it's like what I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue or maybe
They just sayin' that, now 'cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you that's why you layin'

'Cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like so?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool up in here, up in here
I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin' put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin' lest you tryin' to end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
'Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up north type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? Who? Some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

Have You Eva,Undisputed,2010.0,"Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Have you ever wanted to go right, but then chose left
Deep down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Ever seen something that you didn't want to see
Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me
I seen the dark, I seen the light
I seen the day, I seen the night
I seen the wrong, I seen the right
I seen the start, I seen the final

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it",https://genius.com/Dmx-have-you-eva-lyrics

Niggas gettin' trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin' my dick so hard, I'm bustin' in they mouth
And then I snuff 'em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you with your kid
Slid into the shadows, 'cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where are they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits and pieces are all that's that left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin' breath
'Til I pass, 'cause they ass, and I smelled em
I-S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled them
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the murk, erf
Night time is the right time for creepin'
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin'
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin' demon!
Screamin, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gots to get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How can one man kill so many
Innocent people before the age of twenty
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat new leather jacket, I bag it
Along with the jewels smackin' tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin'
Niggas called me Taylor cause the way that I be sewin'
Shit up 'cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the great, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, ""The fuck is you be sniffin'?""
Cause when it come to riffin', I am the riff-raffin'
Gots to say nothin', niggas know they get had

When it's on it's on, talkin I don't feel it
That's the fake shit, argue and just make shit hot
And with my short fuse I'm always quick to make shit pop
Nigga respect this, catch me on the block and with gloves
I'm ambidextrous, sold with the Glock and the snub
But I ain't reckless, with me it's always one big dot
Then one big shot, and one kid drops
Head shot, closed lid over one big box
And a preacher left prayin over one big plot
Never a mess, now I wanna conquer the world
And I'mma do it, wanna know how? Fuckin with Earl
He's the one that took me in to raise the dog from a pup
With his guidance, help create a beast from a mutt
Just released from the cut goin straight for the neck
B.S., Bloodline, what the fuck you expect nigga?


Uhh, WHAT?! Uhh
Uhh, uhh, uhh

It's time to take out the garbage, y'all niggas want the hard shit
I got shit that'll start shit, rip apart shit and disregard shit
Thought it wasn't real no more, just because I got a deal
What you think, I ain't gon' steal no more?
""Usual Suspects"" once again - thus begins
The bullshit we both went through form trusted friends
Bustin him from where? (It's time to peel)
Fuck what you heard baby! Shit's still real
Y'all niggas think your shit don't stink, cause it don't think
Hit a motherfuckin iceberg your ship won't sink
Bitch don't blink, cause I'mma hit you with somethin
I'mma hit you for frontin, I'mma hit you for nuttin? You buggin
I'm lovin it - the obstacles that I go through
It keeps me real, don't make me have to show you
Fuck you cause I don't know you, and listen dog
If I gots to blow you, you know where you goin to

Come on
Woo!
Uh, uh uh

Man, I hear you niggas talkin'
But you walkin' the wrong way, didn't really mean it
I done heard it, I done seen it, don't get caught up in between it
It's a dark road you walkin on, same street that I be stalkin' on
Supposed to be quiet, but you keep talkin' on
Now your mouth got you in some shit
So we gon' let everybody see your gangsta ass get smacked like a bitch
Just to remind y'all niggas, I can find y'all niggas
Click click, what's up? Walk up right behind y'all niggas
Once the four-four hit'cha
You ain't going nowhere but out the door on a stretcher
Boy, I'ma get'cha
Wet y'all niggas up like a pool
'Cause I done told you, Y'ALL GON' MAKE ME LOSE MY COOL
Yo Knock, get the Glock, these bitch niggas is actin'
Making movies, we'll make a movie about this shit after it happened
All that yappin', that them niggas is gettin' away with
Take it easy, my friend, let 'em know, dog ain't nothin' to play with

A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back

Most of these hard rocks turn out to be soft as wet dog shit
Talkin' shit, but when the four spits, dog, they all split
Then all hit the ground around the same time
In the same frame of mind
Things up in the nine left them bitches blind
Hit 'em up from behind—yeah, that's how you do that
He had such a good head on his shoulders, but I blew that
Fuck you, black, you new cats don't know somethin' important
You die quick fuckin' with my shit, and my shit's extortin'
House rules, when I speak, y'all niggas listen
I drop jewels that you cats can't afford to keep missin'
Triggered by stress, fueled by drugs
Shit is about to get real outta hand, dog, better get ya man, dog
Rap shit comes second, I'ma show you what a robber do
Mention ice one more time and I'm robbin' you
Tie you up for a week starvin' you
Beatin' the shit out you every day, 'cause yo, these niggas gotta pay

A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back

Dog, it ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cause he was in the wrong place, at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to breaking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cause that's how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think it's sweet
But ain't a fuckin' thing going down until I eat, so kill that beef
You better, while you still got teeth
'Cause they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make your shit drop out
Copped out, through a you know what
'Cause you know why, and you know my
Motherfuckin' name up in this game, and bitch, you know I
Will never be caught slippin', but on some East Coast terms
New York niggas don't fuck with perms

A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad
'Cause it'd take a lot of pressure of my back
A nigga gotta take the good with the bad
I'm fuckin' with the hood and I'm glad
I wish you understood why I'm mad

And it's always rainin, and it's always some'n
I'ma keep on comin, I'mma keep on comin
So butterflies can't reach my stomach
To get my heartbeat jumpin and my blood flow pumpin
So my life means some'n and it ain't no frontin
For the respect you get for the work in the climbin
For the ways that's beside me and the niggas that don't like me
Got a pistol and my iron if you wanna get to firin

Spit That Shit,Redemption of the Beast,2015.0,"I'ma spit that shit
Show these niggas how dark this shit get
Cause I'ma spit that shit
Show these niggas how dark this shit get

Shit pop off, we don't blow it up 'til we blow it up
Cats better slow it up, y'all niggas know what's up
My niggas throw it up; we all know that
In fact, niggas missing the action, where are they at?
See, you niggas never really been ducked out
But got enough mouth to get snuffed out; roof the rough route
We don't play around here, nigga, we're grown
Start applying pressure, give the dog a bone
I'm taking half; it's just that simple
Or I can start popping niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you're staggering and fallin'
I'm holding up the wall, you got more than enough problems in the floor
You're just wasting a nigga's time; come on, man
I got shit to do, like hit your crew
Might hit your crib, so what that bitch gon' do
Not a damn thing, but dawg's with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conan, whoa man
I'ma go where no man has ever gone
Nigga, when it's on, it's on, I'll let you know when the fuck it's on
I got nothing to hide, but you got a reason to run
Come through like BRRAT, to the squeeze of the gun
And that's just squeezing one, imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into a death row

Between me and you, I'd be in the dark for too long
Bark is too strong, hot light is on
Whatever it's gon' be, that's what it is
I didn't stutter, motherfucka, put that on your kids
Built for war, built for raw
Built for more, built from it all for the dog to the floor
I've been getting down before I knew what getting down was
Shit, I just do what a real nigga does
Get anything straight up
If shit starts falling apart, wait up, let's get this rent paid up
So it's square one, and a nigga can't get a fair one at
Any time of the day, but a nigga can run
Keep shit moving, doing what the fuck we be doin'
They're coming to 'em, but I'm running through 'em
I don't need the headache, I've never been talking to death
But I'll fuck you to death; what the fuck you left?
I don't want nothing, but some fucking pussy
I ain't trying to be all cuddled up,  talking getting mushy
Been there, done that, with that one back there
From when there was none of that to when there was some of that
Niggas still come back, hood for life
Shit, quiet as a cat nigga, where's my wife?
 for the night, that's what it be
Or if its good for tomorrow cause tomorrow well see
Take it one day at a time, my end's in the street
Don't fear my feast, your man's in the heat
That's how the dog gets down on all fours
After a certain hour, I'm knocking on all doors
Anything goes when it's on, motherfucka
Whether you're friend or foe, you gon' lend some dough
And in case you don't know, that nigga don't owe
Whatever I come up on, let that shit go

Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Yo, shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
F**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
GRRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor

It took the snake to make me trust more

Soon as I walk out
Trust you to steal from me, lie to me
Acting like we love each other why do we?
Everything about you is crooked, look it
Fed a nigga some bullshit , and I took it
That's what I get, an old school fucking with a hybrid

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, did what you supposed to do

You cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit
The dog hits coming back to the raw shit
Aww shit they done let me back out the gate
Back out to tape back out to rape
Back off the chains so please back out the way

Keep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue

Should thank the lord that you blew up softy
Don't talk greasy, you grew up off me
I ain't letting go of the block
And if I get a good enough grip I ain't lettin go of the lock
If I happen to pinched I ain't goin to shock
I'm gonna to get aquatinted with niggas in general pop
Stop but don't hate cause everybody got a lil blood to donate
Thugs'll go ape the women'll come around
Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down

Keep a couple of niggas with me that'll bang you down
Now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
Before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
Naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
My New York niggas leave y'all wit razor bumps
Now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac

I run shit here, what's my name
Getting' down for real fuck my fame
Played too many games and the games gone catch up with you
Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round. Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair cause the game ain't fair
And i'll take it there fuckin' with the right one baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one baby

(Big Stan)
I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas",https://genius.com/Dmx-i-run-shit-lyrics

Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that

Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all that's that left

Catch a body with the shotty, pump up one dead

To skirts, like a jag on the merk, arf

Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleeping

Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and skate
Making more moves than u-haul, from state to state

'Cuz I already died
And I don't need to fly
'Cuz I'm already high
And all these snakes wanna know 'bout what I feel inside
I wanna dig up a grave and bury them inside (goodbye)
So what's up, homie
What you want from me?
I'm bad by myself I depend on me only
I survive solely, on the grace of God, homie
I need to find my way so I ask that He show me
So I pray, 
Our Father
, then 
Hail Mary
, 
Glory be to God
 tell me can you hear me
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I inspect each step 'cuz I fear what's next
'Cuz in my mind, I'm dumping on you bastards
Leaving closed caskets
, burning you with battery acids
And if you think my reaction is drastic
I'll wrap you in plastic, 
leave you stretched out like Mr. Fantastic

So if the Lord wants to take my life I'm ready 'cuz...
The world got me going insane
It's like a full time job to lock the dog away
But it will break out so you best watch out
'Cuz ya can't talk shit with a dick in yo mouth
No one iller with the butterfly trigger
Rapid fire rap with with a flow so killah
Hit and run kill ya with an 18-wheeler
Then leave you like the walking dead MJ thriller
And I know I should join society
And follow laws and say apologies
But I just can't 'cuz their hypocrisy
Just bothers me, it's just the dog in me! (woo!)

Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife

You up in the casket with some shades, cuz your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid

We thank you for the blessings you have given us this day
Things that people dont even realize that are blessings
The food you have given us to eat
The cars you have given us to drive
The clothes you have given us to wear
The money you have given us to spend
The lives you have allowed us to touch
And the lives that have touched our own
We thank you for all these things father in the name of jesus

Time wasting, all things that I'm chasing
Eating but don't like what I'm tasting
Everything I thought I want and hunted for
Had me wondering but then I wanted 
Headed down the wrong path, self-destructive
What's my function? I know I am good for something
Lord let me know if my suffering will be in vain
Or how much longer will it rain?
Or how much longer will a stain
By the blood has been shed through out my life, remain
Or how much longer will the pain in the flame
The only thing i gave the game is saying your name

If you know god is working in your life

If you know god and you know what he's like

If you know god then just jump and shout it

I went from ""why bother"" to ""Imma a try harder""
Knowing the only way to make it is through my Father
Stay right beside me, during the ride was rough
And for a minute the devil tied me up
My lifes stopped working, but the clock warns, she was right on time
And I was so happy to see him that it had me crying
Then enjoyed him, know you got a saviour
Starting to be changing your behaviour
Make you wanna shout more, make you wanna live more
You could do without more make you wanna give more
This is what I live for, this is why I do
What I do, It ain't for me, It's for you

And hoes like the cruddy
Because I'll fuck your girl, quick
That nigga Earl sick
That's what they used to say in school
Throwing tantrums, and stabbing niggas with pencils everyday in school
A wise man can play the fool for reasons of his own
I knew that I would understand the reasons when I'm grown
But now it's on
They started something they wasn't ready for
At the age of 10 I'm busting down a steady four
Comin out for visit but what's a visit when there's no home?
Other kids' parents like 'this little boy's so grown!'
That's what happens? When you're raised in the streets
All I really want is to get praised in the streets
And he who lays in the streets with your last breath
Ask the Lord for forgiveness and you may have a fast death
It's not like me to have my back turned to open places
I wanna see it when it's comin, so I can open faces
Open cases got me payin to stay out of jail
While these streets, got me to prayin to stay out of hell
Slipped, and I fell, got back up - slipped again
But no matter what it's been, niggas never got a win
It's a thin line I walk, everyday but I'm good!
Project nigga all my life, but wouldn't say the hood!
Knew what I was doin, everyday that I've been doin it
Seein niggas havin a good time, so i'ma ruin it
Fuck you, and fuck your man, both y'all niggas is puss!
Frontin like you out the jungle but ain't never seen a bush!
When push comes to shove, whatever love we had take it witchu

But when it's on what you gonna do - walk away?

Niggas don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say? ""Nigga g'head"" - you see that?
You gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)
But leave that, alone (WHAT?)
We gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT?)
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)
If the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone
Cause we got the chrome (C'MON!)
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggas wanna lie for? It changes nothin
I'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie
Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)
In other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)
Then what I say will remain here, after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)
No second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for
Stoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)
Them cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)
Dark Man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin
Relatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song (C'MON) I'm right there
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie",https://genius.com/Dmx-never-gonna-lie-lyrics
It’s Personal,Year of the Dog... Again,2006.0,"We all got guns, we all got dogs
We all gon' make that trip to the morgue
We all find it harder to see through the fog
We all know the difference between right and wrong
We should all live life by one fact
Before you doin dirt, the dirt gon' come right back
I seen cats go out like suckers
I seen cats get down like, ""Yo, them some bad motherfuckers""
I see fake niggas and the games they play
Aiyyo, I deal with that bullshit e'ry day
But that ain't gon' stop me from doin what I'm doin
I got things beside bullshit to be pursuing
It's that craft for me, the half of me
Let through niggas in the door after me
Yo, somebody stop me; please, somebody come and get me
If I go, I'm taking niggas with me!

Dog nigga, Ghost nigga
Hop the bar with the toast nigga
It's like the Lord getting close nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggas
It's personal, now we gotta host niggas

(Dog nigga, what up!) Nigga fuck the cop and the warrant
You get a chance, pop an informant
All I need is a Glock and I'm touring
Hit every hole in the wall, have me a ball
And then slide the fuck out in the top of the morning
If you hear me cockin it on 'em, I'm poppin it on 'em
I don't fuck around nigga, better stop it and mourn 'em
And who the fuck asked you to rhyme?
I'm the Ghost, when I come around, they throwing up the hazardous sign
And you ain't around chemicals, just around generals
Who spend, passing they time, blasting they nine
Rather die with my man then the five for ya livewire
Spend half of ya time, smashing ya spine
Other half we getting money and more money
You think about cars, I got ""goin to war"" money
That P and that dog money, we still in the front of the store, money
And if anybody slip, they getting sent to the morgue, money
 - repeat 2X

It's like lately I've been feeling so weak at the knees
And speaking to niggas is just like speaking to thieves
So I keep the hawk ready to eat 'em
Guess already? Then meet 'em
I'm fair game, but I'm ready to cheat 'em
The streets ain't right now, the Colgate White is light brown
These niggas ain't nice, they nice clowns
That's why I'mma start layin them right down
And have 'em there layin in the casket, ice down
Jacob watch on 'em, mortician must've been hazed up
Cause you can see the makeup spots on 'em
This is way beyond ya Avion
The Golden King, more like Polo Spring
And what makes it even worse, aiyyo it's that it's personal
Maybe even ya Earth can go
I'll make it where they can never find the bitch
Right outta the bar, with all kind of shit
 - repeat 2X

Yeah, y'all niggas can get caught up in the hype if you want
Bodies drop over here, this is not a game man
You wanna get caught up in the hype again? Then you can fall in the hype again
This is a movement, Double R, nigga you know what's up
And if you don't, you gon' get to know what's up
Yeah, we ain't playin wit' y'all niggas this year

See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff ryderz is a family
Ruff ryderz....ruff ryderz...ruff ryderz
Lets go...Swizz!!
Uh
This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit
Hittin wit the hardest shit, cuz before we started shit (uh!)
Wit kidz I knew my fuckin friendz all turned against me (what?)
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this
He got my back I got his, schemin on mad niggas (what?)
Dats how we do bidz (uh!)
It's about time to start another, robbin spree
Cuz yo, my way is highway, robbery
When I was up north since 16 I was sendin niggas home in a coffin (what?)
Livin like a orphan, you bad nigga? (what?)
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here
You know my style will put yo fuckin man, in a wheelchair (c'mon!)
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
Dats how I left him g, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, (woooh!) hit wit da hot one
From the shotgun, catz was close wondered how we got done...
Yo yo, e-v-e
My dogz believe in me
Petty thugz hide yo cake, never teasin me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin one'z, tussle wit these
Makin moves, second to none, I locked it, huh
Made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double r, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got gunz, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
Cuz I don't wear sunblock
Ask drag if the fire is hot (flame on baby)
Shit pop shellz, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we comin, then we total the block
We scorn niggas like they mothers, then we wet up they socks
Red dot, excapin on a radar, to seashore, then hide out
And buy out bars till we see far
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money?
Keep y'alls, for us be tearin tryin to hide, then tear out fire
Beat y'alls
Uh, nah, yo, uh, uh, yo, yo
And you can come see me if you tryin to get some
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin the flights
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning wit dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of em givin me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me, and get wit me
And still end up bein mad cuz I charge 50
And as for you suckaz, you can keep those rapz
And screw yo awardz, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shipped but some thingz I never forget
Like if you spent three you garanteed to make back six
Drove the benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stashed, tick the governer off
Even the catz that be hatin still be lovin the dogz
Cuz they know that the double r's comin for war
Wha
Uh-huh
You ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
Cuz when I start bustin the gunz you hidin the kids
And the pieer's still ridin wit clips, survivin wit bricks
We beefin on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin dope or robbin the blocks
Starvin or not, carvin the cheek, palmin the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice this shit is my life
Catch me wit a .45, hot pair of nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face
Gimmie a shank it's holiday(uh)
The hooptie's in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tommorow when they'll probabaly die today
Cuz da pio'll hollow the gunz
Then holla at son (I feel you nigga)
And when he go to holla back, niggas swallowin one
Uh
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon bust
Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot thru the heart like cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's 99, I'm killin you, woman and kid
Fuck scarface, watch me, I'm mo action to see
Than the muthafuckaz that y'all see on t.v
And fuck what you heard, check how sheek get down
Comes the gun, shit, I'm rhymin wit one on me now
You neva know, what clown could walk in the studio
Talkin shit, and there's gon be more than the amps that blow
I'll pour gas on yo skin and watch yo shit detach
Wit a book of matches, now dats when you met yo match
And the worst thing for you is for me to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I'll turn niggas more holy man, than eddie murphy
And I deal wit mo bricks than that city do in jersey
I got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
Wit some of 6-drop niggas
Revolver pop niggas, easy ox niggas, get knocked
Say I smoked detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streetz and cop 56 mo gramz
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin wit the fam and dats word
Hey yo boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You whether drown or die off torture, cause yo skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo bitch a perm wit that
Keep shellz in the envelopes cuz I'll mail out bullets
More blood that a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, got a extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you
You gon do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp you gon be crunchier than chips
Wit my hand all up in the bag, munchin on this shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block is brick on brick
So I got knots on knots, got thingz that'll pop yo top
And double r spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin up, lest they in the wheelchair

Prayer (Intro),Mixtape,2010.0,"In the name of Jesus, let's pray
Father we thank you for this gathering of souls
See that when two or more gather in your name that you...
Wait a second
Your presence
We thank you for our lives father
We thank you for the great blessings
You've given us this day
We thank you for the air you've given us to breathe
Food you've given us to eat
Lives you've allowed us to touch
Lives that touched our own
We pray that we're able to keep these blessings to ourselves as well as other lives
We pray that any obstacle that the devil plans to place in our path be removed in the name of Jesus
We pray that every spirit that is not of you be removed
Every spirit of anger, every spirit of addiction, every spirit of jealousy, every spirit of lust, every spirit of greed
Be removed right now in the name of Jesus
Devil, we rebuke you",https://genius.com/Dmx-prayer-intro-lyrics
Get At Me Dog Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What! Niggas can't fuck with us
Get at me dog. My niggas
That's my word!
I'm the type to kick back and look at shit
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you locked in sleep away camp
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like ""What's that oooh""
What's that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggas thinking they shitty, what a pity
Lemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal
Y'all niggas fucking with the L.O.X
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggas wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggas get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggas don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggas come through then we lock it
(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)
With no Glocks I'm in your town with five locks
Take five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots
It's the L.O.X, three niggas that listen and watch
And nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot
It be that new flow, my niggas, fly niggas
Always high niggas, ready to die niggas
As far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing
Lemme get the one clearance like a sample
'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped
Left somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp
Niggas is done, since poppy raised his son
When bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums
Whether you can flow or not ain't the issue
You don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle
Take a puff then a swig
Think about how I'm gonna
Hold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig
Your money is low, and your flow been late
While I be coming through with new shit with tint plates
The only higher than money, is respect
The only thing hotter than my click, is a tek
So when I hit you with these last bars around your neck
You gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga
(WHAT, YEAH)
My bank account be doubling
While you niggas stay in trouble and
L.O.X. stay fly
Three niggas jig-I
Shit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law
Kingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular
It's Sheek baby
Chicks hate to see me on the Soul Train
With Don Cornelius
And all they got is alias
To work with
To catch Sheek, y'all niggas besta work quick
Now that I'm eating right, plus living well
So nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell
Ain't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan
With a black master full 850 full suspension
While you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years
My stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce
Small black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama
Keep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product
I learn things, just by watching y'all niggas make the wrong moves
Now I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools
Y'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit
Cats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it
P.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B
Your shit be so-so, low pro
On a bus before the cars show
On some old joystick shit, no mirrors
I can see behind me through the cameras
Flip plates, make the whole block go bananas",https://genius.com/Dmx-get-at-me-dog-freestyle-lyrics

Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't

But I don't give a fuck, I don't care

I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick, I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird

Don't tell me!(GROWLS)
Don't tell me it's another one of these PK joints!
Not another P. Killer joint!
OH MY MOTHERFUCKIN'GOD!
Uh, uh, uh

You better stop that
Before I come ridin' back (RIGHT BACK)
Right back to you (BACK TO YOU)
I know you wouldn't like that (OH NO)
We don't need no (WE DON'T NEED NO)
Extra offer see  (WE DON'T NEED NO)
Wasn't really no friend of mine (WASN'T NO FRIEND)
Wasn't really no friend of mine (OF MINE)

I'm part of the meek, started to speak, at age 10
Other kids were ridin' bikes, but that was the age when
I became a man, learned to stand, on my own
One dog, no bone, so young, so grown
Kid left home, shit got harder, kid got smarter
Did my part of the bad shit, I was the starter
Came from the heart of the hood, not lookin' too good
Fuckin' did what I could; ready to bitch in the wood
For all the shit you do, just when you think you sly
What goes around, comes around, the wrong damn time
Maybe too late, but damn, I shoulda did that back then
Shoulda thought about that then, now come on out the den
Slowly, Come on; keep your hands where I can see 'em
You don't know me, but we already got wifey tied up in the BM
And know who set you up? That bitch with the crazy ass!
Another shorty, another party of your shady past!


God don't like ugly, all that love me, wanna plug me
But fuck me, it's about ""Is this really what you want G?""
The more dirt you do, the more dirt you get
More fake niggas that ride, that'll jerk your dick
The more you think your slick, but somebody sees everything
Sometimes the thieves never hang
They remain, outlaws, wild dogs, outdoors
Strippin' cats about yours, it's all about claws
Beggin', scratchin', weighin' and matchin'
You stayin with the batch, and playin' with what you catchin'
Do unto others, as you would have others do unto you, that's under you
You must first separate from, then connect with
Fuckin' with that X shit (WHAT), 'cos this the best shit (WHAT)
Motherfuck the rest bitch (WHAT), it's all about this (WHAT)
Do what you do, and you get what you get!


See what it boils down to, is that it all comes through
Remember what you do, cause it's gon' come true
A little harder than you did it, but that's the way it is
I ain't know it be like this, but that's the way it is
Keep fuckin' with them kids, cause they all get grown and shit
When they get they own, what's gon' been that you shown 'em?
Fuck how to take a bone? How to rob a nigga of his throne?
How to be left standin' alone?
Get a nigga gone, that ain't right
Do it yourself, be a man and fight
Nigga earn your stripes, I damn sure earned mine
I already know your language, now try to learn mine
Dig 'til you find, and when you find you keep
I done spelled it out for you, but you niggas is still asleep
6 feet deep, was just around the corner

Mary J. Blige Diss,Unleashed & Unreleased,1998.0,"Oooh you remind me, yeah
You remind me of such sweet memories
You know what this is
You know what I'm sayin?
Check it out
Uh
Mary J - what's on your brain
Don't you know you can't diss where you came - from
The motherfucking slum
You remind me of when you was a bum
Crazy dumb - getting hit in the hallway
Building 5 - I heard you take it all ways
In the ass and especially the mouth
You get on the radio and now you're from down south, the Bronx, or Brooklyn
Anywhere but from ???
Sure you know the place that you left your mom...
I'm from the motherfucking Y-O
Where the niggas is real and the bitches act like they know
You fuckin ho, you know I know
Cause my mutherfucking man Nas told me so
So did Little Jo, Big Coup and Derrick
Wash from School Street and can't forget Eric
Ain't you tired of getting hit with dicks
You even fucked my man Charles Oakley from the Knicks
You shouldn't use sex to get away from ???
You got niggas trooping to Fordham Road
Just to drop a load
Bitch you shouldn't have hoe'd
Everybody got your code
The pussy is sold - and your ass and face
But I asked my man and he said it wasn't all that
Right about the time you were shopping the demo
He tore your ass up in the back of a limo
And you didn't even care
You left your mom in ??? - on what WELFARE
Bitch you know you ain't right
Matter fact what are you doing at about 8 o'clock tonight
You got the boots and I'm coming to get 'em
Is it true that after you fuck 'em, you'll make a record with him
If so then I'll be there and it won't be hard to find me
Cause like I said before Mary J - You Remind Me!
Yeah",https://genius.com/Dmx-mary-j-blige-diss-lyrics
It’s Goin Down,Redemption of the Beast,2015.0,"Oh yeah
 - I've been waiting
Spent nights out chasing
For your love
But it's going down tonight
It's going down
I've been waiting
Spent nights out chasing
For your love
But it's going down tonight
It's going down
What did you think you would do?
What did you think you'd say?
After I told you how I was feeling
Never thought I'd see this day
I always kept dreaming
Never let failure hurt my heart
I knew that soon you'd see better
All I could do is hope and pray
 - Is there a chance?
Or a possibility?
That I can get close to you
I wanna get romantic with you
Do all the things lovers do
Finally all the things I've done
To get the chance to be with you
I guess it was sure enough worth the wait
Tonight I'll be wrapped up in your arms

I always kept wishing
I always kept praying
Good things come to those who wait
That's what mama always said
Baby that phrase stuck in my head
There's nothing I won't do to please you
Given the chance
I'll do you right
Even inside I have to know

Ooh, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Hey baby, ooh
Oh yeah, ryde or die
Walk on by
Oh yeah, hey, hey, hey",https://genius.com/Dmx-its-goin-down-lyrics
One More Night,Walk With Me Now and You’ll Fly With Me Later,2015.0,"Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night
I've been going through
What I'm going through
Understand, see it's just something you talk about
You can't have the gates and shit
I walked her out
I could be a grimy nigga for real sometimes
That's why I lie cheap and steal sometimes
I know God made me
But what am I supposed to think he made me for?
My whole life has been a hustle
Money coming and borrowed
Half-way to the struggle pulled me out in trouble
God if You listen
I need you to help me, please
Oh you lost a kid
My back's against the wall
I am under pressure lately
I'm about to fall
No I won't let you
Hold up for one more night

What I'm going through
Put me in the hood for a reason
Understand it's cold outside
But I ain't freezin'
You kept me warm enough
You kept me around long enough
To understand the days that come
The life of one man's the hardest
Of course you play dope
But you know you're the smartest
This is the shit we gonna do it
We have to get doing
The place that we all end up
Think about it
Heaven to hell is where you gonna end up

I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night

What I'm going through
Get back when I was a little mad motherfucker
Or was I really?
Or was I just misunderstood?
I don't know if I can take most of the times
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it
But I'm a do the best I can
As long as I'm a buy a 10
That's the best plan
Hold up for one more night
I don't know if I'm gonna make it for one more night

It started of dark, mostly night
Wouldn't dare let my darkness bring someone light
I gladly go through it all for the purpose of a lesson
That will hopefully turn out to be a blessing
No second guessing
Let me be an example of how strong this love is
And to never put anything above his, 'cause what if
It wasn't unconditional, then what whould we do
If he did how we do
We know we wouldn't supose to do the things
That we did but we did 'em
And if that wasn't bad enough then we hit 'em
But you saw it all, So we only ly to ourselfes
Help us, save us from hell
Let me be!

Let me be your angel, let me be the one... (let me be, let me be, let me see!)

I ask a lot of questions, 'cause I need a lot of answers
Sometimes I think I need to ask the questions faster
Surrounded by confusion, am I winning or losing?
Is it because the lifestyle that I'm choosing?
Ups and downs, Right from wrongs
Goods from bads, Rob out the ghetto all the good I had
Still I grab, opportunity and ran with it
And a brother still can't get it, man quit it
All lives have already been written
There's no need for asking'
Don't mess with the fruit thats forbidden
We know god loves us, but don't test faith
Because woulda coulda shoulda are all to late!

Without a friend I want to call on
Unlike the rain would never end
Untill you came and found a friend
And through my ups and my downs
I have someone to stick around
Your the reason I keep believing!
Let me be your angel, let me be the one for you
Let me be your angel, let me be the one...

Murdergram,Simmz Beatz Presents - The Best Of DMX,2002.0,"Niggas is dead, dead I tell you, can't be serious
What you think is gonna happen
With three of the illest niggas together
Street music and so fourth on one track,huh?
Can't be serious, it's murda nigga, huh, it's Murda
Motha f**kers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother f**kers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Why would you f**k with me
Knowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha
Cock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal
And promise you only one thing, to not miss you
Jahova know the god that served ya
Cause dead or alive when I arrive it's Murda
Shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
F**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight, It's alright
I let the world know I shine like ice
I bet it all I can throw a hard four in the dice
Cause I'm a gambling man, you should gamble with a gat in your hand
Spin in barrel and put it to your head
Cause we don't dance no more all we do is cock and spit
Dedicated to giving you nothing but thug shit
Think we playing, you undoubtable fall further
F**kin with I N C is Murda
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
URRUURRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A f**king snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!
Them niggas did it raw, with no condom
You find em, sayin sorry he for what he said before I blind them
Get the flame out the four fifth, and there ain't gonna be no more riff
Dog you want a floss tiff, but would of made it to the door if
Bullets travled alot slower, and you ran alot faster
But they don't and you can't so don't think about after
Cause tomorrow ain't comin, so stop runnin
Cause you gonna die like a sucker

I be robbing mad niggas in the street for loot
Since there ain't no money in jail, I'm taking sneaks or boots
Inmates is getting bust wide open over jew-els
Names rings two bells, so large I got two cells
On the Island it was strictly a bing thing
Niggas know the half, from the L to Sing Sing
Ding Ding! Another knock out on the lock out
Money was kinda big so I bought the soap and sock out
Hit him up quick and ran up in his cell
Robbed him and scared the motherfucker to tell

On my way out, trade in my soap and sock for a Glock
Back on the block, seeing a lot of new faces
Which means more money from a lot of new places
I give a nigga every reason to trust me
But if you don't want to get robbed you better bust heat
Bumped into a nigga, I remember from up top
Looked him up and down (AIYYO), ""What's up Hobb?""
In jail he was washing draws and shit
Now that we both out, money gots to be a Vic
A crab nigga so it's only right I shit on him
Should I smack him first, or sick the Pit on him

There's a new sheriff in town, just been re-elected
You ain't gotta like it but respect it, nigga check it!
I'ma get it in until the nigga wins with the dividends
Cause, we gon' walk the dogs, 'til the bitter end
You like, ""Oh it's him again!"" I knew that's how you felt
 Pussy! I knew that's how you smelled

Talkin 'bout, what you got, ain't air in the teeth

And niggas really don't want me to pop the trunk

Bag up the pieces, wipe off the Timbs
Jump in the Benz, five cars deep
4 o'clock in the morning, riders still asleep
Shut shit down whenever we hit town
GIVE A NIGGA PASS! I lay my dick down

Man, you niggas play too many games
Too many jokes, what I said? Too many names

Play fair with men, act like one
Talk like a bitch and get smacked like one
Got rabbit in 'em, get jacked like one
Make the call, hit me back like done


You always been the son type nigga
Scared to pull a gun type nigga
Talk shit and run type nigga
Seek through the fake shit and sniff out the bullshit
From a mile away so put the smile away

Yo, yo, yo!

Ayo if gon' sleep on something, might as well be a bed
And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head
Cause if you targeting the L.O.X., you might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots ain't got blocks, ?llabuta? muchacha
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in coffee and keep shit cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, ain't no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag? My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back

Ayo I hope you ain't tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be makin love in her in the mouth
Type of cat buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since people was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me that
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all hits, then listen to our hits
Ain't nuttin y'all cowards could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all players ain't got chips
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggas thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Abel

Burnin niggas often, they call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket
Throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then

It's my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Wasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass unbder the earth quick
I Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot

Then tell ya mother next time she see her son is never
And I'd be on your dick if my name was ""No Pussy Ever""

Doom-doom-doom-doom-doom, slide like Bill Bixby
This shit be having niggas in the emergency
Undergoing surgery wanting to murder me
When you go, you know you heard of me
And your last thought is what you did
Wasn't worth your life, that's what your ass bought
Caught up in some shit and I had to let you feel the steel
They found his faggot ass slumped over the steering wheel

One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, yall niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's 96, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me liftin through that riffin shit buggin'
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy

A nigga just been chillin, I been doin fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin clothes
When them bitches through, ain't to co sure when they home
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big

Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans

I am from the ghetto, I don't do the disco
I just pull my pistol, take a chunk of your soul
It's me who ride up by you, police won't recognize you
Run up right behind you, and let my ratchet squeeze
And, you don't want no drama, pistol-whip your momma
Put that bitch in trauma, you don't want to war with me

Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop

I stand six foot three, four thirty, any less

Understand what I'm saying, if not, how I figure
Nine to your tongue while I play with the trigger
Will make you understand what I say a lot quicker
Do we have an understanding, yeah, my nigga
In case I be fronting, know they really don't want it with me
Come coming with them hollows and heaters - to put it, simply
So if your team don't follow its leader, then come, and get me
But all you cowards better believe it - you coming with me

And they don't want to, fuck with the bitch of this shit
Because I position the hits, speak with the nine
Niggas ain't ready for that shit that I spit
Oh no, get at these niggas for sure
Because once you cross the line, you already know we get dough
The quicker they slip, the quicker their ready
Holes in your Pelle, body laid up in the back of the deli
I thought you all already knew about me and these triggers
Get touched if you ever fuck with me and these niggas
The bitch is loose, got niggas like 'Bitch you loose'
I'm the realest bitch of them all
Because I get down for what I stand for

Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop

Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop

Fuck I've got to say it for, you already know
I was going dizzy, I get busy with the flow
Oh, it's like that, alright, aye yo
Niggas coming through anytime, anywhere
Pop up and pop niggas, up right there
Put your man's brains in the motherfuckin air
Pop, pop, pop, you drop, drop, drop, stopping
Look at what I've done to you niggas
I don't want to be your father, tired of sonning you niggas
And, I'm sick of being bothered, I'm confronting you niggas
And take this And, run, in a minute, I'm hunting you nigga

This is the hood

We like I wish they wouldn't
Niggas ride it like the dawn

Oh no the tears we both know what that do
Pop them, dress them and just burry them

Fire,Undisputed,2012.0,"Uh, uh, uh, uh, grrrrr
Grrrrrr, WHAT!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

I love music cause it's somethin special
I just have the words and when I'm done, I bet you
It'll make you easier to cope with the pressure
In dark, cause you think the light won't let ya
Right now all I see is shapes and sounds
You snake you clown that's why I shake you down
Got somethin I want, I'ma take it now
It is what it is, you cryin like ""How I'ma make it now?""
Get the FUCK off your knees, I don't swing like that!
Cause when I let it go I let it go, I throw that thing right back
Man, I can smell pussy from a mile away
Nigga yo' style is shade so, put the smile away
Niggas actin like I'm the only one with problems
You know somethin I don't? Fuck it, let's solve 'em
And at my worst you not even HALF of me
Which is one reason why you'll always be AFTER me
FAGGOT!

Oh my God!
No matter how hard I try I just can't get away from it
I got so much fire built up inside of me
But when it's time to let it go
I got one thing to give and one thing only
YO DOG!

Hot bars is the only thing these muh'fuckers gettin
It's time to show these niggas Dog ain't raised a fuckin kitten
Eat twenty niggas like a 20-piece bucket of chicken
Ain't on my level snowflake, who the fuck is you kiddin?
The hottest chick in the game is what I am still
Fire hot enough to burn your whole entire grill
And believe me, them third-degree burns are hard to heal
I'll have you wishin you liestened to Fire Marshal Bill
You can't take the fire that I'm bringin y'all
I'll have yo' ass beggin for a fire extinguisher
And all your mans, lookin at you like damn holmes
I'm hot enough to burn the flesh off your damn bones
So for you niggas be claimin that you got heat
And claimin that you're the best and the next to eat
I'll be next to X or next to Grease
With bars that'll hit you like a bottle of Texas Pete

WHAT!
Don't start what you can't deal with
'Cause I'm a nigga that still get all up baby, real shit
I'm a dog for real, I beast on niggas
Take it back to the streets on niggas, feast on niggas
Open a bottle of liquor, pop a can of beer
Pour out the first sip for the homies that ain't here
Because you know in your heart they still right there
It is what it is, at times life ain't fair
You ain't me so what I'm 'bout to do to this rap shit
Will have some real niggas on some ""excuse my back"" shit
Wish a nigga would, wish a nigga could
Regardless of what you think, a nigga's still good
So easy to, kill a nigga
Especially when you don't, feel a nigga
Can't see the, real in a nigga
We don't know about Gucci, we don't know about Prada
But what we do know is we gon' do what we gotta

No Sunshine (Album Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's dark and hell is hot
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
""Who turned out the lights?""
Is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight
But ya niggas be playin'
Thinkin' it's alright keep playin' with that road
And you gonna know the night
When you layin' in that cold
Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave
Now it's all over
Preacher said you was brave
But now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to
Ain't no savin' you
No matter how many tears your mom's cried
Ain't gon bring your ass back, plus in hell, you gon fry
Why? But now the only 2 relative questions is
Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention you name
They knockin' on wood, did I get my point across?
Another body on the shotte, another joint I toss
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on

'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
There ain't no sunshine
When the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine 'cause I'd like to hear some shots
Get at me dog, niggas know how it's goin' dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man of the unknown
One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin' home? Looks like you
You hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2
Won't be a strike 3 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like, yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'
The Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'
You was ballin' a minute ago in it for dough
Till it was, â€½Yo, I swear to God, I didn't knowâ€
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'Cause when it's on, ya niggas gonna be gone

Your shit is quick and your shit is sleek
But this shit is thick and when you hear this shit
Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, I'll do it 360, come up from behind
Tap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that I'll have you burin' the ground
Be like, ""Damn, ain't nothin' left of money but a pile of ash""
Life is good so please enjoy it while it lasts

The quicker you go depends the stronger the flow

But not me because I'm a nigga that can get out of them cuffs

Make A Move (Original),Rap Sheet,2000,"Ye-yeah. Some moves hustlers gots to make to get that cake
Get bagged by a jake
And if you fake, or you a snake
And that's how that's goin down
(I gots to make a move and make it soon
I gots to take a block and make it boom)
Let me holla at y'all
It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
Until I knock off this rock I don't get to eat
Sometimes it's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strong-arm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein' crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin' niggas just as broke as myself
Livin foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, cause niggas talk about goin out of state
Money got an eighth, comin back, coppin' a lot of weight
Where's my plate nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do, (what!) and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doin bad
Will be glad to get up off they stoop, lookin sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how to get down
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon?)
I gots to make a move and make it soon
Gots to take the block and make it boom
We comin through so make some room
Found somethin that could be somethin if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
This purple top, thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin
Killin the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
Cause nigga if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ahhhhh!)
You think I'm here for the hoe flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon?)
I spend my money on niggas cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin shit but suckin my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas on six blocks, makin the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin what they been wantin
And we see the same shit, up in New York niggas frontin
Stick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em
I keep the burner and the duster with the gloves for em
Them motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they, really tryin to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that run for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that ""nigga took your pack"" shit
I ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
And if I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
Just so you know, I ain't gon' never put my Glock down (why nigga?)
Cause I'm a hustler motherfucker, and I'm holdin my block down
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon?)

I don't think so!

Like shorty you see them niggas reaping around, warn us
Unless he coming through, gunning through, running through
So be careful what you do
See them slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die till this fucking dog bit me
I don't know what's wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all niggas been wanting to murder us
(?) the third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me in the locks
Leave you dead (red?) like fox
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug for you

I bring beef to a closure

And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the fuck y'all want?
Daddio with the calico
Let the gaty blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you
I before you
X and Ja-Rule
Death before the (sauna??) now and prior to
Boss man spy on you
Conspire you
Me die before you?
You liar, you
Niggas is dead off the hits I improve
Fuck it, I got the feds who ain't buy it to
Y'all niggas don't listen
When the streets are in prison
When we find them we twist them
They fucking up missing
Y'all don't understand we want y'all all to hate it
It's murda
Murder incorporated
It's murda
In crime we all related
It's murda
See if y'all can fake it

I'ma murderer and murdering anything that moves
Through ya nine niggas
Straight do or die niggas
Caught up and fall victim to the worst shit
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shot on the world and reflect it
Niggas don't respect it
So get it the worst way
Fuck with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day
Now everybody want you
I'm feeling like: stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time
It's murda
Whenever you see blood
It's murda
Lay you down for the love
That's us
Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your niggas ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in (?) rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving niggas cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya (?), Ja-Rule the O.G
Niggas better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murdery shit
When I look in the mirror my reflection is killer

When I bite my teeth sink
But how you gon' see a nigga livin' in the fog
I dealt with rats I rattled with snakes
I battle with hate
The Lord is great, survive the maze
Rebuke the devil in ongoing debates
I try to be cool and try to show love
At the same time I want Trump on his back with his face blown off

Just cause I love my niggas

The Story,Black Gangster - Original Soundtrack,UnKnown,"I'm always talking shit, cause wherever I go I walk in shit
And now they got me on some stalking shit
Broad daylight, niggas is crying, ""But I don't want anyone to blast""
So from the roof I pick em off like a scab
And watch the slug bust a mug like a watermelon
He shoulda thought about that before he got caught up telling
And now another kid grows up without a daddy or a mommy
Cause at the funeral I hit up the caddy with an the army
Of real niggas, with nothing to lose
Cause when it's time to go you don't get to choose
I make the muthafuckin rules and I enforce em
Shorty's people was loose ends so he lost them
I took the joints and tossed them, in the river
At the same spot that I dumped this kid that didn't wanna give a nigga the combo, to the safe in the crib
Look, money, that's why I did what I did
{2 niggas Talking.....}

Mad stressed and I'm about to have a breakdown
It's time for pops who got the store on the corner to get a shakedown
He hasn't paid for protection in like two months
So I figured I'd leave him with like two fronts
I break up shit to let him know that I'm real
Reminder, I know where you live so don't squeal
Told him, next time I come, have some paper for me
Don't fuck around and turn into another caper for me
Cause though he's cool all that cool shit stops
And I be in the crowd talking bout, ""Yo who killed pops?""
It's a shame, he was caught up in the game and couldn't play it
Before I smoked him, I asked him ""who's the man"" and made him say it
Three times, and that's how many times I hit him
A nigga was acting like he didn't have to pay so I did him
Yo I think this shit is going to my head (for real)
But let that be a lesson, don't pay dues and you dead
{2 niggas Talking.....}

A little birdie told me that the feds were on to me
And they wanted to do something real wrong to me
So I broke out, played the L for a while
Checked my sources and found my name was on file
Under gun for hire and extortion
But yo I never use the same joint twice as a precaution
And I heard this kid tried to set me up
He knew I knew so he tried to wet me up
See he was under investigation for drugs
They set up all types of phone taps and bugs
Then when they bagged him, money went out, represent (he was my friend)
Said they'd let him go, all he had to do was snitch
And I know now he wish they would have kept him
Cause it was sweet how I crept him, wet him up then left him
And that's for muh'fuckas that don't know
Go against the grain and you feel the pain

The concrete done found your meat
Cuz hittin the ground still hot from steam comin off
Eyes rolled back in his head, and coughin up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beatin punks to death
Ain't nuthin left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
Hoping the casket was changed, cuz your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid

And get your ass tugged out the Hudson by some old man fishin

And I'm moving fast for a person with a strong load
But the weight I bare
U can't wait to share
Scrapped it there, my faith was always there
I'ma make it yeah, life is what it is
Nobody said that you would make it fair
And I'ma take it there, built for war
Gladiator with a good heart but built for more
But sometimes ain't enough sunshine till you dark cloud

Don't worry about where you go

Call on God cause that's who I'm close to

I was introduced to the Devil
And through it all, I still chose you
I needed you, you rose to the occassion
Stood beside me, no matter what I was facing
Here I go chasing the wrong thing again
But if I fall, I know its you not him

Put me back on my feet, ugh, lift me up

(I gots to make a move and make it soon
I gots to take a block and make it boom)x2
Goin Against the grain... Know what im sayin? Ye-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on (thats my plate!)
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere (what?)
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it
Watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go (go down) against the grain
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggas go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back, niggas ain't built like me
And by the end, niggas was like ""Yo, why you killed Mike, D?
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my man, so I let my cousin do him (we open up shop! It's four in the mornin!)
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder (aahhh!)
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (fo-fo!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take a block and make it boom (come on!)
Man, listen, money is missing and shit is hectic
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (cash long!)
But money talks and most niggas is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up
Cause I can't go for that bullshit
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggas in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story
The famous ""Oh you didn't know I got robbed!"" story
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grand is always gonna be there (why nigga?)
Just never go against it",https://genius.com/Dmx-against-the-grain-lyrics

My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door

One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, yall niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having evil thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's '96, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me listen to that riffin shit buggin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me
You listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha

So do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo
A nigga just been chillin, I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gone, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, that the shit you like you do switchin clothes
When them bitches crew, ain't to kosher when they hoes
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin for that Coogie sweater, patterned up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big

My baby mother be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more""
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like ""Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck you""
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck you
You laying up like you don't wanna leave
I told you I got a girl but you don't wanna believe
My baby mother be bugging, and if you wanna see what honey do
Be here when she get back and she'll bless you with that .22
But I ain't even fucking with her like that
Cause I know this is the only thing to make her fight back
And to them scheming niggas, go ahead and try your hand
Cause you might get her number, but you'll never be her man
And if you get the pussy, you bets to fuck her some place else
Cause if my son knows your name, I'm gonna take your health

You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggas is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a Backdraft cause my fire retirin, aight then
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a lover slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a f... fort
Caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it

Wasted, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass unbder the earth quick

But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters use to like me, but now they call me homie
Use to have a family now I'm out on my own
Had to scrap with the Pitt, cause I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly
I use to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I gets none, so I gotta beat my dick
Time are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living
Eatin turkey flavored Now or Laters for thanksgiving
If that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter
Because they said I smelled a little like the living dead
And look like helter skelter
My clothes are so funky, they bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self
Even when I was little nothin went my way
I got beat up, and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's
But for those who choose to snooze
Since I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin to lose...

Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta
Leave my black ass there till the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showin through my back, cause I haven't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The racoons, beat me to the garbage cans
I'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytime
I daydream of a Manwich
When all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know
Thats 2 peices of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather

When I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em
I'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin 'em
I did what I had to, to get where I got
Though I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catchin vicks just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew
Mess around get in my way and I'd bag you too
Cause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning
Hit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning
Winning, was everything, thats why I had to ask
My man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to
Now, who needs a major label, we got our own
I'm the divine master of the unknown
Ain't nothin changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door
But criminal at heart, even though I don't show it
I was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)

Wright or Wrong,The Weigh In,2012.0,"Ryde or die, right or wrong
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm
(I love you my nigga)
Shoulda known that was bullshit all along

I been doin this for a minute
So with or without you I'ma get it, cause I'm in it to win it
I put in work, paid my dues
Stepped in dirt, changed my shoes
Got those dirty, asked God for a new pair
And He musta heard me; thought I was worthy
Taught me to listen cause in New York
The rule is the more you know the less you talk
So if you fake niggas actin like you down for the kid
When it goes back, don't be around for shit
That's why niggas like you get found in a ditch
You ain't built for war, actin like a bitch

Ryde or die, right or wrong
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm
(I love you my nigga)
Shoulda known that was bullshit all along

We all in the sunshine, we all want the fun time
So niggas forget that it is gon' rain sometime
Whatever the weather
We supposed to be in this together, B.F.W. forever
I see now that y'all niggas been takin shit lightly
One minute you love me, next you wanna fight me
Am I gon' lose? Not likely
And even though we both know that you a cat, you still be tryin to bite me
C'mon vato, gato
That's a real bitch move you made, you know the rest, uh-oh
Walk like a man you gots to talk like a man
Chin up, with a limp, dick in your hand!

Ryde or die, right or wrong
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm
(I love you my nigga)
Shoulda known that was bullshit all along

Whatever the fuck I do I go all out
Wait for a few days, ryde or die, fuck out bitch!
I ain't got time for these cats that wanna pretend
Like they gon' ride 'til the end
Cause soon as you hit a bump niggas jump ship
But when it's all good same niggas suck dick
Money is the root of all evil
I ain't a fake nigga, and never had a reason to deceive you
Don't nobody do for me, but me
A nigga gon' be alright, you'll see
When I need a friend, God sends me one
When I need some ends, he saved me some
Whatever I need I get it, so I don't want for nothin
And I ain't gotta hunt for nothin
Sittin on ten whips, a few chips
And that mayne with the laser from the hip catch you slip

Ryde or die, right or wrong
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm

And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you

To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go""
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them

No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest

Tell what he was thinkin' so I opened a way, (c'mon!)
Went from broken away, you know he hurt before he died
Makes you wonder if he lost his shirt before he died, only
Two knew the answer and one of us is dead, so anyone who
Seeks the truth can get it straight to head!
Than you and him can discuss what I did, yeah it was
Wrong dog but I slid, i'll repent one day, just not right
Now, you hear my shit all on the street i'm kinda hot

On The Frontline,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I gotta make it out and move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
Bet this time around they won't scare me
I am the last one
""The champ""
Won't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front lines with my weapon
I am the last one

Damn
I went through it again
After telling everybody I wouldn't do it again
I kind of feel like I've let my people down
Yup
But to get them right
I gots to pick myself up
When I heard this beat and hook
It was so raw
Looked in the mirror
Didn't like what I saw
But all I could say was
Shits gotta change
(For real)
Either get it right or take one to the brain
If ya'll knew the pain that I went through daily
Trying to stay sane through the wind
Y'all hear me
I'm slipping, falling, I can't get up
But this time I'm out of control
I don't give a fuck
But for the thugs
I'm the last hope for the team
I'm the reason why some niggas
Got a hole in their dreams
These cats know what's good
I am the hood
I ain't hoping that they don't
I wish a nigga would


I gots to do it for me
Do it for them
I ain't playing with this shit
I'm a' do it to win
Know I can do it again
Cause I did it before
With little to no effort
And Y'all niggas know the story
First album dropped in May
Second in December
Both were Platinum in one year like
Y'all don't remember
Only nigga who's first five albums
Debut at number one
Wonder why I call you son
My son, I've just begun
To get started up with the hardest part of it all
It's to climb a slippery wall and
Stil don't fall
Break down and call up to God
When it get too hard
I know you ain't gonna let me go now
Brought me too far
Showed me I was a star
All my life, I know it
All ain't right, before I call it a night
I'm a thank you for it all
The blessings and the curses
And I hope you're listening
Cause there's a lesson in the verses

Grimy and gritty, outter limits in this inner city
Niggas is definately assed-out, fuckin wit me
End up with a gun in your mouth, straight cheese
I should bust 'em, cuz' see me killing you don't mean nothing
I'll put you through a lifetime of sufferin nigga
Then you'll learn that bridges ain't made to be burned
Drug money is rightfully earned, well deserved
Some rules just think, are fit for takes
And Ja's rules make em large, that you fatefully break
Unless you wanna get spanked, with the 9 fully loaded
We can murder each other, meet at the Crossroads
And if I die tonight, in the immortal words of Pac
My niggas gonna hunt you till you drop, believe that
Niggas is capable of all that, take your mom for ransom
Give little kids back, that's the way we do things
Never leave shells, never drop names
Roll with the game as it change
Ja's to blame, I'ma let this world share my pain
In my demise you can put it on my grave
""Here lies a lost soul of rage, seen brighter days
And outta darkness done graduated, may he lay""
And this I swear, here in Hell we don't play fair
Cross the line, with my nine I'll be bringin you here

I make moves that get me where I'm going
Break fools that act like they ain't knowing how it's going
Dizown, with the dizark, cuz' that's that kid
Unmask that kid, look at that bastard kid
That don't mind having to break shit or take shit
And motherfucker, if you ain't me you ain't shit
You fucking faggot
You know I coulda been stuck it to you
Nigga I wasn't even think about fucking with you
But I bet now I know your man is thinking twice bout who to fuck with
Shit is getting bad, I'm robbing niggas I grew up with
And I know it's just a matter of time before I get shot
Or I'ma torture this niggas little sister and make him watch
Give a nigga a little room, now he's trying to house shit
But I bet you get back on some mouse shit
When I punch you in your mouth, bitch
Aaaah, a nigga broken off quick
Yelllckkk! (gagging sound), is the sound he makes chocking off dick
How you feel, eating with a straw he has to suck through
Fuck me? No fuck you, now I gotta touch you
Fucking bitch sucking dick like a jockstrap
Put them Glocks back
Trying to be the first punk motherfucker that shot back
Got that? didn't get? You know where you gonna be laying right?
I'm telling you, ha, you know what the fuck I'm saying right?
You will respect this, cuz' it gets reckless when I cut the
Dun-nun-dun-nun-dun-nun-dun-nun, you be like ""What the--Nooo!""
But it's too late cuz' the heat-seaker done found the heat
The concrete done found your meat
Cuz hittin the ground still hot from steam coming off
Eyes rolled back in his head, coughing up chunks of flesh
Then niggas'll roll with his monstrous death, beating punks to death
Ain't nothing left but the memory of what used to be your life
Funeral payments, and dried up blood on my knife
Y'all motherfuckers don't understand, when it's on it's on
You up in the casket with some shades, cuz' your eyes is gone
I know I'm wrong, that's why I did my dirt and slid
But you made it happen, with that bullshit you did
Now you want peace? Well take a piece of this ammunition
And get your ass drug out the Hudson by some old man fishing
My mission is almost complete
This message will self destruct in two seconds

Last nigga was lucky, he only got mushed
I have the niggas falling off like they got pushed
And I get flows, straight from the get-go
Hit a nigga wit' fo rounds, that's split yo stomach
Coming through niggas like an obstacle course
A lot to in source, give props to the boss
Unstoppable force, take it as a loss
That's what you get for getting fly with niggas
Roll with niggas niggas cause you cool with niggas
And you'll die with niggas, ?? this nigga
Cause I'm possessed bust a hole through his vest
Into his chest, grab your boots cause I'm stressed",https://genius.com/Dmx-any-mc-lyrics

You don't know the chances.. What if I should die?
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances.. I'm so blind

Another place I find, to escape the pain inside

Deeper and deeper and deeper is all I'm turning to
Living a life that seems to be, a lost reality
That can never find, a way to reach my inner
Self-esteem is low, how deep can I go?
In the ground that I lay, if I don't find a way to
See through the grey that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lies
I can't see, I can't see

But first you got to let me know if you with yo whatever
Is you bustin off or is you just holdin a gun
When you should be here are you there rollin a blunt
My ribs is touchin
I need this little bit of money more than you think
That who think two niggas would think two hours could hit two banks
Is you ready for the big time
This is a big crime that I'm commiting
And I'm sure there'll be casualties because this time is slippin

Force me to put something hot in they chest

Boom, one shot through his respiratory system
Kissed him good night, put him to bed
Put four mo to the head, so he know he understood what I said

Girlz 2 (DMX All Vocals),UnKnown,1991.0,"Yeah, uh
 (verse 1)
Girls are my profession and obsession, I place nothing above them
To me they're not possessions I really truly love them
Short ones, tall ones, big ones, small ones
Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall ones
Yo, I love them, especially the cuties
The ones with the soft complexation and shapely booties
The kinds that make you say ""Oh Boy"" ya
But if you're ugly ones, I ain't got nothing for ya
I'm not conceited, I'm convinced that I've been naturally blessed
To be desired when naked and irresistible when dressed
And with that, , breaks down resistance
Of me to a cutie, I bag them for instance
I seen a cutie with a bootie, wiggling just like Jell-O
Me being a player, I approached and said ""Hello""
But she didn't hear me, so I tapped her softly
She turned around screaming on me ""Back up off me""
I said damn, there is no need for hostility
I'm a mellow type of fellow but still with tranquility
She said ""I recognize that all of y'all are the same
After only one thing, and I'm not simp for the game""
I said ""Come on now sweetheart, do I look like a Player""
She said ""Of course..sike""
But for the sake of argument let me know the deal
I want to ask you
(DMX singing)
Are you for real?
Are you really for real
Is this love I feel
The way you make me feel
 (Verse 2)
I'm as real as it gets
My name is not James Brown, but I could leave in ""Cold Sweat""
And I bet, no ifs, ands or maybes
When I finish I'm a have you saying ""Do Me Baby""
She said ""Alright, I'ma give you a try""
Because she said ""I think you're kind of fly and my type of guy""
She said her name is Crystal and kept a pistol on her
And she said if I ever cheated, believe I'd be a goner
So I played the perfect gentleman every time I was with her
And when I wasn't with her I was gone to get her
And when I wasn't going to get her, she was come to get me
And when she wasn't coming to get me, she was with me
So for awhile, everything was smooth
I waited and contemplated my next move
My instincts told me that the time was right
For us to get together for a magical night
So I called her, I said ""Hello"" she said ""Hey, hold on
I already know what you have to say""
(DMX singing as if he was Crystal)
Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Because I'm not too sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
For I don't know how I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I
 (Verse 3)
Hold on sweetheart, just chill, relax
You're telling me the answer and I didn't even ask
Don't you think, that we should be alone?
This isn't the type of thing to talk about over the phone
(DMX singing)
Why don't you come over and go with me
Come on over to my place

Where we can talk about it face to face

Come on and go with me
Come on over to my place

So we can discuss the terms of picking up the pace
She said ""I thought about it, and I think that you're right
But my parents are home so it won't be tonight
But why don't you come over tomorrow at 8
My parents leave at 7:30 and won't be back until late""
I said bet, let me go and get set
Tomorrow will be a day that you will not forget
So the next day around 7:54
I fixed up like 6 times and then headed for the door
And when I stepped outside, I was asked where I was going
By detectives with .9 millimeters that was showing
I said ""To me girls house"", they said ""No you aren't""
I said ""Why not"" they said ""Because you a have warrant""
I said ""That's impossible, how could that be?""
That said ""It's right here, robbery, first degree""
Well, anyway, to make a long story short
I ended up in  going to court
So I called Crystal that night around 8
I said it's just a mix up and blamed it on fate
She told me that she loved me, I promise to wait
She said I'll see you at 4, at your next court date
Despite being locked up, things weren't bad
I still had my girl and for that I was glad
She always came to visit, didn't mind the hike
And every night I wrote her letters telling her things like
(DMX singing)
I can't fool myself I don't want nobody else to ever love me
You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say ""I love you""
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh my love, a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
Oh my love, a million days in your arms
Is never too much, I just don't wanna stop
 (Verse 4)
Days turn into weeks, weeks into months
Today's the 25th and I've only got mail..once
What has happened to my love life?
Oh do I feel like I've been stabbed into the back with a knife
I tried to believe, I said ""She loves me, she does""
But deep down, I knew what the scoop really was
See Jody has my girl, and now she was gone
Just thinking about it had me singing every love song
I'm saying to myself, how could she do me wrong?
I said it's not her fault, I was away for too long
I thought I had a girlfriend, but now I know better
She told me that she wrote me but I never got the letter
And every time I tried to call her, nobody was home
And since I had to call collect she put a block on the phone
She told me she would visit, but damn I haven't seen her
You wanna know why, because Jody is in between her
Legs and getting busy, he even ate the coochie
Yo, I bought her everything from Fendi to Gucci
But Jody had something better, he didn't even have to sweat her
And if he doesn't have her by now, he's gonna get her
(DMX singing)
Caught in the middle I don't know what to do
What can you do when your man is untrue
There's another man (another man)
In my life (in my life)
Another man is beating my time (Another man is beating my time)
Another man is lovin mine (Another man is lovin mine)
 (Verse 5)
I was upset, but there was other things on my mind
I was , I was facing a lot of time
And on the day of trial, I was never for awhile
But when they said ""Not guilty""
I stepped with a smile
Back to freedom, freedom on the streets again
But I had to go and see what was up with my friend
So I called her, just to make sure she was home
I said ""Hello"" and a man's voice answered the phone
I was confused, at first I didn't know what to do
He said ""It's Jody, and what is it to you?""
So I hung up the receiver, picked up my gun and
Straight for Crystal's crib, I started running
Murder, murder, my finger's on the trigger
Murder, murder, I'm a murder this nigga
But then I thought, why should I do him
He wouldn't have the pussy if she didn't give it to him
I thought about killing him, I thought about it twice and
Nah, because it wouldn't be nice
But for the sake of curiosity I had to go and see Crystal
And I could , why it had to be me
I knocked on the door and just like before and
I heard another man's voice play me and couldn't take it anymore
The door opened up and Jody walked my vexed
He looked me up and down and said ""I guess you're X""
Now here comes Crystal, yelling and fussing
Hollering and screaming, shouting and cussing
She looked at me inside and got quite in the hall
She said ""When did you get home, and why didn't you call""
I turned around to leave, she said ""Please don't go""
I said ""You used to be my girl but you ain't nothing but a Ho
I understand because I'm a man, but there's no way I could stay
(DMX singing)
Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)
Spread my wings
And fly away...(away)

What You Want (The 24th Letter),The 24th Letter,2001.0,"Y'all niggas is dead, dead!
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Face illest street niggas, illest rap niggas
It's murda!
Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Yo, shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
F**kin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin' up raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, I made it scrapin'
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
GRRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin' damn well that what I do is wrong, but still I do it strong
Niggas is making movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
These blocks are not for frontin', So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor

Edge Of Da Night,Unleashed & Unreleased,1998.0,"The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from going under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, something I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got coming sometimes you don't know
What you asking for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, fleein' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', grrrrrrr
An growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
Than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
What's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here

I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

We built this Double R thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggas round up
Gettin down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!
Thorough type niggas that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggas goin down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out
C'mon fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9
Double R and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
WHAAAAT! We untouchable, AIGHT?
Yea, WHAT!

Yea, yeah, YEAH! Be strong..
I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggas with the weed spots
And all my niggas on them cell blocks
We gon' R-U-double-F R-Y-D-E
You can't fuck with my army
My niggas is untouchable, eatin niggas like Lunchable
.45 be crushin you when the bullets be touchin you
Paul bearers'll carry you
To the cemetary where your momma gon' bury you
Black suit be fittin you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees
Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggas who be sittin in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable
=Chorus=
=Infa-Red=
Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..
All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggas a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggas that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin rocks the size of Domino pizzas
I'm untouchable, nigga
=Chorus=
=Sheek=
Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo
U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double R chain from the side of the car
Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?
Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on
That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
To stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face
=Chorus=
=Drag-On=
Uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines
I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggas is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms
Yeah, my block is real, my niggas is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin my diamonds and changin the color
With change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh
I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X whattup?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)

Were i wanna be,UnKnown,UnKnown,"In the darkest days, the rain that falls
Hear me from the life that calls
And all the things I need to find an answer for
But in the end I know I'll see
The truth in all that I believe
I do what I gotta do
Cause I know that this, is where I wanna be

Got a lot to say, but don't know who to talk to
Step with a purpose, but don't know where to walk to
Anything I ever said, ever meant something?
I know, because the person I said it to, told me it meant something
My life has a meaning,my life has a purpose
No matter how dark it gets, I knew that it was worth it
Fuck what it looked like on the surface
Seen it all ,but not all heard us, like sometimes i was worthless
Can't expect everybody to get what you doing
Can't expect them all to be with what you doing
Don't give a fuck if a motherfucker hating
What you think it is with me ,but whats good with you lately
I hate when i sense this shit
Trying to make sense of this shit knowing that its sensitive shit
Niggas so dumb, that they don't even sense the shit
You said the shit, so I know you meant the shit you said


Born with addiction with fast living with high stakes
I race down a highway of life with no breaks
Make no apologies for the risks that I take
And manning up to the repercussions that I face
No silver spoon, I was raised in a crowded room
Rarely seen the sun, faced a lot of gloom
I hit the streets too soon before 21
Working on the clock since and on it until I'm done
I'm never clocking out, but always locking in
I had a warm heart, lost a lot of friends
And losing them make me feel like I was drowning
So please forgive the chill when you around me
Dreamed of living right, big family, the picket fence
Grandkids I will get to share my story with
But here I am, living vile as I stand my ground
Just hope it doesn't end, with shots fired, man down


If i could bottle the inspiration
Id be a billionaire,straight fuckin villian yeah
X baby you still in there
I feel the air, i can smell the death in it
Yall be leftin? it so fuck nigga step with it
The walk is easy, the journey ain't worth nothing
That's why every day a nigga wanna hurt something
But, I made progress, more or less
If I can avoid the stress, I can avoid the rest
A nigga stay dealing with the bullshit daily
Niggas is worse than the bitches, y'all hear me?
Straight up and fed up(what!)
I'll have you sprayed up and wet up(what!)
Now you laid up and won't get up
Now look at what the fuck you got yourself into
All i did was open the curtains and you jumped out the window
That's what suckers do
You just a punk motherfucker you
Got a nigga like motherfucker OOH!",https://genius.com/Dmx-were-i-wanna-be-lyrics

It's like, the darker it gets, the brighter my light will shine
So regardless I'm lovin' this life of mine
And with the Lord by my side, it don't matter what the call of life
Cause let me in, 'cause I was going for the ride
Ain't blind, ain't gotta sin to believe it
I just know you gave me the word and that I really need it
So I pray for my enemies, I pray for family, my friends, my loved ones and those who pretend to be
Sacrifice your son just to give me a chance
So I thank you for the plan, I thank you for your hand
Shepherd, watching over your flock of sheep
But I'm good, cause you watchin' the dark when I sleep

Speaking of the word, it's sad that not all get it
But by the grace of God, I was born with it, come on get it
Jesus loved me from the beginning, that's why sometimes
Even though it looks like I'm losing, I'm still winning
But I ain't never been blind, never gonna sign
Never been one to let the Devil know what's on my mind
'Cause he wants to destroy ya, but the Lord will resurrect ya
If ya hug the little boy, then the man will protect ya
From the dark to the light, right to the wrong
I'm gonna stay up in this fight, from the night till the morn
Well as I'm in the grace of God, my heart will stay true
And I'm gonna do whatever the heart will say do with it
When things go wrong, Jesus loves me
I'm singing this song because Jesus loves me
I'm gonna be strong cause Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me, yes, Jesus loves me

Jesus loves me, yes I know
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)
Jesus loves me, yes I know (Oh yeah)
For the Bible tells me so (and I believe it in my soul)

Now clap your hands with me (uh huh, uh huh)
And stomp your feet with me (come on, come on)
And bob your head with me (uh huh, uh huh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Not because my momma told me (NO)
Not because my daddy told me (NO)
Not because my preacher showed me (NO)
Gotta feel it in my soul!
Not because my homeys told me (NO)
Not because my teacher taught me (NO)
Not because my pastor showed me (NO)
Gotta feel it in my soul! (I feel it in my soul!)",https://genius.com/Dmx-jesus-loves-me-lyrics
N*&&@$ done started something,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop Mo' with holes up in skyscrapers
In condiminiums, overlooking our drug capers
New York City, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole commity like to puff L's and look jiggy
Who wan' test this? My semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through
I got niggas who pump on yo' block and in yo' spot
Who sit next to you? Protectin you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, frontin, frontin in eclipsesis
Ayo, Ma$e and The LOX
We takin knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The rack of sing-sing alumni
Who got more beef than a Islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My AK slay gays, spray strays wit niggas names on it
Often I bug, then we'll soften a thug
Have a chump coughin blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a Tec at Ma$e, and, have a explanation
You bring your crew and em and I'm doin em
Then I'm beatin em down with aluminum
Then I'm puttin two in em
You can't touch me, I've been devil sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelevant
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started somethin
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started somethin
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started somethin
Yo, check out the kid that get coke like Sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the Costa
Rica, sippin margaritas wit a mami
Cleanin my Tommy, showin love to my army
Whenever The LOX find rippy blocks, we kill em
Yeah I hear niggas, but I still don't feel em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissin us
My 16's be so real, you can feel em in your vain
Like Ramello's pops from Sugarhill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spittin clips at your face
We started from the bottom
You'll see bad niggas pardon, whatever
We can do it at the Garden
Word life, this shit is real big
I'm makin niggas blow trial even if they not guilty
I want a palace for my thugs, wit oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get wacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only gettin up, splittin up your anatomy
Official lock family, grants niggas handin me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understandin me
Sittin at the table, plannin and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless
If you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like Pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle
Any ya niggas done started somethin
Actin invincible like you god or somethin
If you god, then I'ma makes a lot til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start bustin off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark
If you love the money, then prepare to die for it
Niggas done started somethin
You can lay in the flames, or hug the sky for it
Niggas done started somethin
Don't came at me wit no bullshit, use caution
Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering
Got niggas fearin, fuck whatchu heard, this whatchu hearin
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggas flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet
Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggas see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive ID is impossible, so you know
John Doe is what they gon' be puttin on that tag on yo' toe
Now who gon tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got whatchu came for
What's that?
Surgery wit the chainsaw grrrrr, I hit the fuckin streets
Cause like I said before ain't nothin goin down until I eat
Mu'fuckers think it's all about impressin bitches and stressin bitches
Well, I'm testin bitches game, adressin bitches, and caressin bitches
And dealin wit mu'fuckers on all levels
What I'm dealin wit is all devils, fuckin with snakes
Runnin wit niggas you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggas, dirty niggas
That come through and worry niggas
30 niggas that like to bury niggas
And scary niggas get it all the time
Cause what they got is all of mine
Your man was talkin shit until I pulled the nine
And if I don't know you, I don't fuck witchu
And if you wit my man, then he gettin stuck witchu
And gave it the money
Cause I just lost my mind when he crossed the line
Sent his back through his chest
Then I tossed the nine, boss of crime
Black Gotti, I stack bodies wit the black shotty
Bitch-ass niggas who act snotty
Get it
These niggas is for real
These niggas ain't playin
This ain't no fuckin game
You think we playin?

U aint $$$tt,Mixtape,2010.0,"It's dark and hell is hot
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'cause when its on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play
""Who turned out the lights?""
Is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight
But ya niggas be playin'
Thinkin' its alright keep playin with that road
And you gonna know the night
When you layin in that cold
Dirt gettin' tossed in your grave
Now it's all over
Preacher said ""You was brave""
But now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty I done gave it to
(*boom*) Ain't no savin 'you
No matter how many tears your moms' cried
Ain't gon bring your ass back
Plus in hell, you gon fry
Why? But now the only 2 releative questions
Is ""Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?""
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention you name
They knockin' on wood
Did I, get my, point across?
Another body on the shotte
Another joint I toss
(Chorus)
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
'cause when its on, ya niggas gonna be gone
Every time 'cause we don't play (Repeat 4x)
There ain't no sunshine
When the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine
So I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's
So niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine
'cause I'd like to hear some shots
+Get At Me Dog+ niggas know how its goin dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man of the unknown
(GRRR ARF) One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin home? Looks like you
You hear strike 1, talkin' shit, strike 2
Won't be a strike 3, 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye
While he hit you from the rear
Be like ""Yeah, holdin' you up 'cause you fallin'""
The Lord ain't comin' till niggas stop callin'
You was ballin' a minute ago
In it for dough
Till it was ""Yo, I swear to God, I didn't know""
(Chorus)
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Whatchu think you gon get
Fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One (one) two (two) three (three) here I go
Your shit is quick and your shit is sleek
But this shit is thick and when you hear this shit
Damn right I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you be blind, i'll do it 360, come up from behind
Tap you on the shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that i'll have you burin' the ground
Be like ""Damn ain't nothin' left of money, but a pile of ash""
Life is good, so please enjoy it, while it lasts
'cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends the stronger the flow
When niggas know I don't give a FUCK, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on

Have You Eva (Grease),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Ever wanted to go right, then shows left
He down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

Ever seen something that you didn't want to see
Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me
I seen the dark, I seen the light
I seen the day, I seen the night
I seen the wrong, I seen the right
I seen the start, I seen the final

Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it",https://genius.com/Dmx-have-you-eva-grease-lyrics
I Get Scared (Grease),Redemption of the Beast,2015,"I, I get scared and it comes

I, I get scared when you're gone

Y'all don't know things I know
Where I've been and where I go
Y'all don't know cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you let me be me
Y'all don't know the pain I felt
How I played the cards I was dealt
Y'all don't know what you're talking about
Y'all need to stop running your mouth

I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

I get down for real I know it your way
Sunday to Sunday when the game is gunplay
Remember that one day, I'm gonna get it
'Til I get it, all I get
We can get to them and the fat bitch cooking
Like a nosey this Snooki
Been at the age hunting, since the age 11
I think you on stage, you fronting
Look here
I'm that nigga and I knock on your door
You look into my eyes you be like ""dog, what's wrong?""
You feel it like I feel it, there's something in the air
Wait come here, yeah it's coming from right there

But I know I'm gonna be alright

You would never let me real so I always hate
Make a nigga take it back from where it all began
Even be real, ye it's that bad
Let me get to sippin' ye we're not that
Whenever you gonna do there's no concentration
Shit there's something on my cock take of your face
And you was in the wrong place at the wrong time
I'm taking everything you got I want all mine
How you gon' stop me when I don't stop for signs
Hey you got mine, I'm gon' start lying
But instead a nigga tryin' don't stop it from happening
I guess they won't get it 'til they stop clapping",https://genius.com/Dmx-i-get-scared-grease-lyrics
DJ Envy interlude,The Weigh In,2012.0,"Let me tell you about DMX
DMX is probably, one of the artists that saved Def Jam back in the day
When Def Jam was going down
And-and he saved Def Jam with the, with the cruddy raps
But let me tell you how generous DMX was (Okay)
This is when I was producing
DMX flew me down to uh, L.A. (uh-huh) when he was shooting a movie
And uh, we did about four or five tracks
But the reason I knew DMX was so big
Is in the middle of the movie he stopped filming
And was like ""Envy, let's go, uhh, fly helicopters."" (ha ha ha)
And we went to the store, we bought remote control helicopters
And started flying helicopters in the middle of the set!",https://genius.com/Dmx-dj-envy-interlude-lyrics

Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here
Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go""
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here
I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

You Don’t Hear Me Though,Hev E. Components Pt .002,2001.0,"But they don't hear me though (uh huh)
Niggas don't hear me though 2x
(DMX)
Niggas wanna shout, I'ma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'm a break jaws
Niggas coming out, I'm a take yours
School Street, home of the brave nigga, we make wars
Stuck in the cage, where do we turn
Niggas spending time on the streets, where do we learn
Who gonna be there to teach em, reach em when they in trouble
Bark up at your dog, cause we all up in the struggle
The change in collars is coming with brains and scholars
We gonna get it on baby, until it rains in dollars
Rotweilers ain't got nothing on the Pit
Putting on the rips, why y'all niggas frontin on the grits
We can all eat or we can all sleep
We can pull heat with the full heat or make it all sweet
We all deep, since you best at getting touched, leave it alone
Cause dog, If I wanted you last month, you would've been blown
My nigga T.P. creep with me, frequently
Two deep with me, secretly, evilly
Problem solved, shit resolved, next issue
Baby nine on the ankle, in case the Tecs miss you
Hit you, ready for more, ready for war, you ain't afraid to die
But this pistol in your mouth got you afraid to lie
Buh-bye, see you in Hell until I get there, sit there
I'm a hit there, about when you in your fifth year, shit yeah
(DMX)
I always catch a nigga blind in the fog
Talent of a guy, mind of a dog
When it's on it's on, it don't matter
Cause y'all niggas chatter, my niggas splatter
Thought you was badder, well my dogs thought otherwise
Screaming like a bitch oh you thought we was those other guys
Nigga tried to snitch, ran home and told his mother lies
But fucking with this clique is one sure why a brother dies
Who gonna pay respects, when you laying in that box
Playing with The L.O.X, DMX will spray the spot
That'll make it hot, I torch when I touch
Let me loose, your arm is coming off when I bust
Dusk after Dusk, you going out the way you came
And you must've flipped once the way you was layin
And now your momma prayin, you better off in death than in life
But you in Hell, wishing you had stepped towards the light
Now you know, but it's too late
Niggas don't hear me though, until it's too late
All that ""I'm sorry, yo I didn't know""
Is a waste of breath when your man is laying up in different clothes
Body full of holes, and I'm a man of my word
Told me he would get it, as he ran from the curb
Think it's a fucking joke, you can get it like he got it
Spot right next to his, same grave, read about it

Love That Bitch (Remastered),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hey you see
This the shit, I be talkin 'bout, know'msayin?
When you don't know, what the fuck is really good know'msayin?
You feel one way, but you know you gotta walk the other way

Aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch
Cause of some bullshit I don't trust that bitch
Cause of the kid I'm stuck with that bitch
But my niggas like, ""Yo FUCK THAT BITCH!""

Aiyyo it's like this man, shorty got a kid
On some drunk after the club shit, we done did
All week bitches got me hittin the Remy, full throttle
By the time I finish the bottle them bitches is models
Let me break it down like this, here's what happened
I was y'know, tryin to fuck and, once I get to rappin
We at the crib, bitches leave they panties on the doorknob
Puff somethin, ten minutes later we on the floor hard
AH! AH! Huffin and puffin
She screamed it more cause she can't get enough of the lovin
Now, look where it got us, nine months later
Baby is born and I'm realizin I hate her


""YOU DON'T GOTTA CHILL WITH HER!"" Man, they don't know
I'm still with her cause I'm tryin to see the baby grow
That's just the pops in me, see I ain't never had one
And now that I am a father I don't wanna be a bad one
As shorty get older, how do I explain
That I really can't stand his mother? She a pain!
And I never really liked the bitch, out the gate
It was those two bottles of Remy, plus it was gettin late
Now I ain't say I ain't had nothin to do or to blame
Man I'm the Dog, bitches stay screamin my name
She knew it was a fuck thing, she ain't my wife
So why I gotta pay for her for the rest of my life?


Child support? You're killin me! But it gets worse
Moms got a thirst that'll get her put in a hearse
Some say it's like a curse, the way she got me locked down
It feel like I'm trapped and I'm tryin to get out now
From the beginnin, shit was cool
Check it, a nigga was hungry and this bitch was food
And I, wanted to eat 'til the Dog got full
Cause I knew how I felt and the things that I would do
Bust it! From the beginnin you had my mind goin
Look forward to seein you every time knowin
Couldn't see shit cause, love was blind
Fuck it, that liquor is what gets you blind
REAL TALK!


I told you so (yo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)
Cause that's the way it goes (but I'm stuck with that bitch)
I told you so (my niggas like, ""Man fuck that bitch"")
I told you so (aiyyo dawg, listen I love that bitch)
Not to fool with hoes (but I don't trust that bitch)
Cause that's the way it goes (but here I'm stuck with that bitch)
I told you so (now niggas like, ""Man fuck that bitch"")

Bitch! Fuckin bitch, bitch! Fuckin bitch, stupid bitch
Stanky bitch, fuckin bitch! Bitch, punk ass bitch
Ugly bitch, bitch, fuckin nerves hate you bitch

Niggas Is Up To No Good,UnKnown,1994.0,"Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how I love the slaughter
Plug your daughter, full of more holes than sponges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough kis from the Cubans, to build a fuckin fort
I'm caught up in somethin that I can't control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, that's swole
Catching bodies like a cold, and I stay sick, so face it
You make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scramblings hot
So I snatch up my man and the gambling spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggas shot, that's one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest
(Chorus)
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
""AIYYYO"" NIGGAS IS UP TO NO GOOD (2x)

I'm fed up with the bullshit, so now I'm giving
Slugs to other thugs who don't know how the fuck I'm livin'
I'm wondering, what the fuck you eye-in me for
When you know that D for, blowing shit up like C4
We walk to New York, I stalk, left a assailant
Under stress cause ATF keeps me under surveillance
I got a lot of hatred up in me and I've wanted
Send me to the penitentiary, to knock out a 10 to 20
For the many lives I've destroyed and such
Ways that'll make the days of Freddy seem like a touch
Is it much asking to be left alone not to be bothered
Got bitches on my dick like I'm their baby's father
Bring back to Pearl Harbor, blowing up shit
And big fat shoutout to all the bitches that suck dick
I must get, my dirt done, before the daylight
Make sure my flow stays tight, you fucking A-right
(Chorus)
I holla at my peeps as I creeps through the hood
""AIYYYO"" NIGGAS IS UP TO NO GOOD (2x)

Niggas be like ""Ill"" when I wreck, cause I don't go fair
Bitches be like ""Man he ain't even have to go there""
Whether I get your ass with the body blows
Or hit you with the shotty holes
Your fuckin' crew is running like a snotty nose
I ain't a killer but I'll kill something
And if a nigga holding something, I'm a steal something
I'll peel something back like a nigga's cap, leave him stinking
Put a hole in his head, and find out what he was thinking
Niggas who don't know the half
I show the wrath of a savage and do bodily damage
To a motherfucker's cabbage
Money had a lot of mouth but as soon as he seen me
His bitchass copped out to a mister-I-didn't-mean-it
Niggas fiend it cause they want it, but don't get it
Cause they sweat it, to fucking hard and let it
Take over shit, dead it now set it
Full breaded like a pit that scratches first, hittin fast
How many motherfucking times must I put foot up in your ass

Flashin, talker, no action
Read emcees like tv's with captions
Charts we smash on, guns we blast them
Spit fire like blow dryers and drag dash on
Your career won't last long, real name shawn lassiter
Four words for y'all, f type no passenger
Flow nastier, man you know what i mean
And i keep them diamonds shinin blue, yellow, and green
So the wrist look like a twister mat
Man, i cock the biscuit back and twist ya cap
Opps, clipped ya face just missed ya hat
This go out to those that think this just a rap
Well mister, address the gat and we'll address ya back
Nasty, nasty, spittin discusting raps
And i doubt that cha'll cats can fuck with that

You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
These ryde or die boyz will rough you up
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
These ryde or die boyz will touch you up
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
These ryde or die boyz will bust you up
You don't wanna war, you don't wanna drummer boy
You don't want no drummer boy

I hate cops, and i like you even less
I turn your whole block into a bleedin mess

'cuz i pop buck shots like i'm ???
And i can tell you won't blow, gotta scary finger
All talk, no show, jerry springer
I don't care if you a skinny or a burly nigga
I'ma have ya face lookin like a blurry mirror
We shake your features, y'all make believers
And the eight'll make you shake like you fake the seizure
I ball of the scale, break the meter
And if you ever go to jail, they'll rape and beat'cha
Hold up, take a breather, i'm way too tough
Got kicked outta pre-school, played to rough
I straight grew up, i'm still a bully
Used to take your lunch money now i steal your jewelry
Ha, okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, okay

Don't make me reach for these, i got heat to squeeze
Make your face melt like pizza cheese
You need to leave, 'cuz you don't stand a chance man
I get greasy like mechanic hands
Y'all niggas all sweet like candy yams
Clear blocks outs, hop out the family van
Lookin like a handy man, with tools on the waist
Put'choo in the ambulance with two's in your face
You'se a disgrace, you've never been hot
And i can tell how you talkin you ain't never been shot
Yo, its whatever or not, if you want it, its war
You can choose what i'ma use, the pump or the four
Then decide where you gon' die, trunk of the floor
'cuz i'ma tell the law i don't know nothing at all

A lotta niggas think they hard, this is somethin for y'all

Critical Condition,DMX ‎– Spellbound E.P.,1991.0,"""Critical Condition""

S-P-E-L-L B-O-U-N-D belongs to me
But it was bitten by another MC
Thought he knew me and could do me
But that would never be, wanna see me, wannabe me
Couldn't see me or catch me
You're just a tiny-weeny Pee-wee, that couldn't match me
X-terminator, terminator X
And in reverse I'm the top that'll rock the first
Hype rhyme, of my time, every time is rhyme time
And even on the radio, rhyme time is prime time
Nickel and dime rhyme, committing a crime rhyme
An emcee would want to be like my rhyme
A rapper that's smart is the one that learns
Dumb ones die from third degree burns
Lit em up, torch em, scorch the Bentley
I'm killing them softly, but doing it sadly
It would've been all right if he just walked past
But the brother wanted wreck so I wrecked that ass
I'm doing demo, not demonstration but demolition
Leaving competition in critical condition
Whether a jam in-doors or parties outdoors
Hangin' emcees like western outlaws
Next time you hear the X rhyme won't you
Mind your own business, I know you won't do
The same that he did, you get what he got
Blindfold, cigarette, one-two-three shot
To the head, left you dead and stinkin
But at least it'll keep the next man thinkin
About what will happen to him while I'm rappin
Snatching up by the neck and bitch slap him
So next time you're feelin bold
Keep on Movin' like Soul II Soul
(scratching)
""Critical Condition
You're in critical condition"" 4x

Your condition is critical, competition is pitiful
Oughta put it in the words of Daffy Duck, you're despcicable
Dope, if I was a drug I'd be a Kilo
Trips of 4,5,6 if I was playing Cee-lo
A roulette, a black jack like in a casino
And I still kick a slow jam better than 
Rhymes is what I'm dope with, you better get hope with
Soap with rope with if you think you can cope with
Me, the D, cause that's who I am
Got more bodies than the Son of Sam
Love to eat a sandwich, peanut butter and jam
But I do not like Green Eggs and Ham
Won't slip, trip or stutter
Easily cut a, rapper like butter, make you say what a
Hell of an emcee, drink Coke not Pepsi
Knock ya out like the late Jack Dempsey
You're weak and lack style no need to act wild
Slay another rapper worse than a crack vile
I caught ya choking, no smokin' coke and
No time for jokin, cause I'm provokin'
It's just a token, chump rappers I'm yokin'
And I'll break ya down and leave ya broken
Catch a like Batman, eat ya like Pac-Man
Stopping crime like Jack and the Fatman
I'm more aggressive than Lawrence Taylor
But I'ma good guy like Popeye the Sailor
So next time you think of battling quit
You got the nerve to call yourself an emcee? Bullshit
(scratching)
""Critical Condition
You're in critical condition"" 4x

I'm in the limelight, you're wrong and I'm right
And if you plan to bite a rhyme of mine bite the rhyme right
I'll stop you like a stop sign or better yet a stop light
And then bag you like groceries in ShopRite
Oh, boy ya, I don't eat Goya
My name is DMX but I didn't make ""Latoya""
It's me the great one, rappin Pitbull
I already eat one so I'm kinda full
But I can always make room for another
Father, mother, sister, brother or whatever other
That wants to try me, they're grimy, slimey
Looking like BuckWheat or better yet Stymie
Can't deny me, take me or buy me
Wet me or dry me, bake me or fry me
I start to switch up and change the pitch up
Back smack the wack crap, you start to bitch up
No need for beefin, so keep your teeth in
Your mouth out the rhyme I caught you thievin'
Your rhymes are stolen, and you won't be holdin
A mic for much longer cause I be rollin'
Just like a bowling ball, knock ya down
Find yourself swollen and on the ground
There's no way to describe the rhymes I've written
So cold, I could leave a rapper frostbitten
So hot, I burn him beyond recognition
When I'm on a mission you're in critical condition

Unstoppable Force,DMX ‎– Spellbound E.P.,1991.0,"I'm the D-M-X, an unstoppable force
The only way I'll ever stop is if my voice goes hoarse
But then again that wouldn't stop me, because nothing can
I lose my voice, I switch the style and make a rhyme with my hands
I'll make you leaf/leave like a wreath, step on you like a peddle
If rap was the Olympics, I would have a Gold Medal
Rhymes I kick it like Kato, mold you like clay dough
Squash you like a tomato, peel you like a potato
I'ma wildcat, style that, puts me on top of the pile
For a while, I'll smile cause on the drop of a dime
I'm just about to rhyme
Fuck doing a crime cause I don't have the time
Or the effort, I left it alone when I was younger
Went from a  into a fearless hunger
Now I wonder, how I, ever made the transformation
From an unknown, to my music being played more over, told ya
I'm a Casanova, fucking every girl that doesn't mind bending over
I'm a player, layer, dope rhyme sayer
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J ya, L-M-N-O-P ya
Q-R-S-T ya, you'll be a W-X-Y-Z ya
Every time I see ya, another wannabe ya
Just like me a, the capital D to the M to the X is
No I'm not a sexist, nationally known from New York to Texas
Sail it like a river, can't stand liver
So cold I make you shiver, cry then quiver
I'ma pimp with a limp that's far from a wimp
And even though I'm not supposed to, I love to eat shrimp
And Lobster
No I'm not a mobster or gangster or criminal
That the women'll call a prankster
The boss going out at all cost
I'm DMX, an unstoppable force
(Chorus)
""Unstoppable Force
DMX an unstoppable force""

I'm the unstoppable force of, rhymin', I'm the boss of
Crime and the same time, I'm in the course of
Saying what I like with a jet black mic
Without a cord, I'm never bored because I fight
With my mic, steadily, battles I win em
Deadly as a snake with rattles and venom
Hmmm, now think again
Do you still think you can step to me, and win?
No I didn't think so, I ran out of ink so
A pencil will make it so funky it stinks
So dope, I'll get a crackhead high
And then again, he'll OD and die
So may I, say I, been labeled as a bully
Am I semi, no because I'm fully
Automatically loaded, dramatically exploded
Exploit it, avoid it, why, because I wrote it
The mic is like a weapon when I'm steppin to
I'm getting wreck like a demolition crew
And I'll bet, your girlfriend sweats, I know who
But I'm a threat, there ain't a damn thing you can do
When I press up, cause I fess up
Mess up and fuck up
Flash a little too much cash and you getting stuck up
Diss the X, you won't get far
Do it, and I'ma smack you like the bitch you are
Because you're a sucker butt, PooPutt
There's nothing you could do but shut up
Cause I'm fed up with you but, I'ma let you slide
Cause I'm in a nice mood
But on the other hand, I don't mind being rude
Extremely quick to flip, or take no junk
Better than Dominique on a reverse slam dunk
Five foot eleven which is not that tall
But I can handle a rapper just like a basketball
So before you fill your oats and start thinkin you're fly
You better act like Sybil and ""Walk on By""
(Chorus)
""Unstoppable force
DMX, an unstoppable force"" 8x

An unstoppable force, not to be reckoned with
Clear my throat, get to one two checkin with
A mic, I'll beat up, slow down and speed up
Mixed the batter, serve you on a platter and eat up
I know you wanna do me, you would if you could
So when I'm hungry, you're finger lickin' good
Better than a three course, you feel the remorse
Of the U-N S-T-O-P-P-A-B-L-E force

D-M-X T-H-E G-R-E-A-T
Back the fuck up, because I don't burn I singe
And even if you murder me, I'm getting revenge
And coming back to hawk you, stalk you
Everywhere you walk you chump, from LA to New York to
Where ever you go, I'll be there like a shadow
Shoving a mic in your face 'cause it's a battle
You know my M-O, my name rings bells
And emcees are catching the same hell
(Chorus) (scratching)
""Catching the same hell"" 3x

They say D rock longer, so long is what I D
They say faster, so I multiply my speed by two
They say D get more aggressive, so I rock harder
And when they say ""Fuck that nigga"", then I'm a start a
War, it just might turn out to be
A six month motherfuckin' wrecking spree
Whatever happens happens and it don't get no hotter
Sleep on me kid, but I'm a do what I gotta
I strike at random, creep like a phantom
Next year, this song will be the National Anthem
The intensity of respect for me
That emcees have, is everything it's meant to be
I'm not the type to hype and start frontin
Niggas talk a good one but ain't doin' nothing
No need to double check cause I kick game well
And emcees are catching the same hell
(Chorus) (scratching)
""Catching the same hell"" 3x

Get loose, I get cold like Juice
To cook that goose, produced by Dr. Cuess
And I'm the Grim Reaper, putting rappers in the sleeper
Like Barry White I'm getting ""Deeper and Deeper""
Try to put me out for the count first crack
But like the Night of the Living Dead, X is coming back
For more war, for sure, I'll be the vic-tor
Skedaddle cause in a battle I'll break your jaw
Didn't you know that, the X man is a pro at
Tearing up the microphone doing a show at
Where ever there's a set up, I go head up
Since you're strong *spitting noise*, pick that up
I thought you learned a lesson, that Smith and Wesson
Not the one to be messing with, cause I'm the best in
The industry, the Dark Man is no joke
I'll make ya choke from the microphone smoke
You get hurt messing around with the X
Cause straight up and down I disrespects
In any context, whoever is next
I'm like a pair of Air Jordans, you're nothing but DEX
Sex, the X will make you beg for mercy
Barreled over that ass like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Yeah, it ain't hard to tell
And emcees are catching the same hell
(Chorus) (scratching)
""Catching the same hell"" 3x",https://genius.com/Dmx-catching-the-same-hell-lyrics

Sucka For Love (Deezle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Doing me like you do, cause I know that's what you do (x 5)

Never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like wassup
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut

Listen boo, you’s a bitch, you been a bitch
You know how niggas do
Run up in a bitch, fuck her well
And the bitch, you call them bitches
But then in a week or 2, fucking all them bitches
A nigga gotta fall back and take a breather
Shorty suck a mean dick but in the morning
Gotta leave her, wasn't trying to deceive her
I just wanted my dick sucked
She cute as a motherfucker
And she got a big butt
Now I'm like, what do I do from here
Cause she’s acting like she ain’t trying go nowhere
I ain't really trying to get attached to this bitch
Shit it's friday, I just want some ass in the bitch
Can’t be mad at me, I'm just doing what niggas do
Got kids by him, and you wanna be a nigga's boo? What!? Really!?
Oh you think it’s like that?
Ok! I’ll be right back

I ain't never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
I don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like ""wassup?""
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut
I ain’t never been a sucker for love
So if it come down to you and me you know
S don’t give a fuck, hit the next bitch like ""wassup?""
Cause at the end of the day
You ain’t never been nothing but a nut

It was summer time, I was in the slumps
Seen that chick from before, I was like wassup
Remember me? I was that kid
It was you, her and me, we just did what we did
How you expect me to respect you
When I know a police file of other niggas that you gave your sex to
I ain’t never been a sucker, so if you think so
You got the wrong motherfucker
What’s my name? Ah ah, bitch! What’s my name?
You know what the fuck it is
I’m a real nigga, that’s gonna handle his


I like the way you beat hits, oooh, that's that street shhh
Shorty can you keep a secret? (""Yes..."")
You know what I’m trying to creep with
Come on, cars outside, hotels up the block
Jump in the ride, you and me for the rest of the night
It’s all good, click, (""Turn off the lights"")
Back it up like that girl, ooh, that ass fat girl
We almost there baby, oh shit yeah baby!",https://genius.com/Dmx-sucka-for-love-deezle-lyrics
I run shit - dirty album version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Man are you for real?
You niggas can't be fucking serious
You not for real, you gotta be playing
You better walk away
I run shit here, y'all just sit here
Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here
We get through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all niggas knew that
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggas that's how we do
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run shit here fuck y'all niggas
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggas
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it
Fuck I done did it, shit it
You ain't even half way close to being with it forget it
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here

Getting' down for real fuck my fame
Played too many games and the games gone catch up with you
Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair 'cause the game ain't fair
And I'll take it there fuckin' with the right one, baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one, baby
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit

Stop Being Greedy [Woodstock 99],Woodstock 99,1999.0,"Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I could flip that flow, I could stick that ho
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Ain't a thing about the shit I came through I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin' dreams
Or nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but never
Will I kill, I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin' on 'til what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it calls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin' motherfuckas, stay on the floor
4-4, that's what I get sick with (Grrrrrrr)
Four more, now all this is liquid (Grrrrrr)

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift
I'm the best, so unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin'
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin'
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money, just give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin' me to stop, but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowin' red eyes, everything else is black

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate

When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thankin' me for their help
Hopin' that they not around when it gets dark outside
When the sun's goin' down, you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day, that's when your luck stops
One drops, then another and another
Gun pops, goin' through you and your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fuckin' with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight 'cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when it's your time to go, you go

Y'all been eatin' long enough now, stop bein' greedy
Just keep it real, partner, give to the needy
Ribs is touchin', so don't make me wait
Fuck around and I'm gon' bite you and snatch the plate",https://genius.com/Dmx-stop-being-greedy-woodstock-99-lyrics
