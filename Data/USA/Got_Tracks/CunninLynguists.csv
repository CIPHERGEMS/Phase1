Love Ain’t,SouthernUnderground,2003.0,"Love ain't for the faint of heart
Start training, this game is hard
And arduous, you're gonna play in the dark, like when it rains in the park
You're hardly conscious of the stains and scars, enabling your partly clouded logic
To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
Now, you're working yourself out the same as when you strain' with a nautilus
And you're willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
Then, do you really regret when you've shredded your promises?
Now, I've tested the waters, kid. Sipped it; rippled the pond a bit
Visits have been abolished, and this shit's killing my confidence
Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment?
If you miss chicks when they're around, the phrase ""Let's quit"" isn't an option
You best fix whatever's wrong and just move on and get on with it
Cause, You'll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
It's sad, but proud or not, most your standards go down a notch
When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
Cause, It isn't really my time, is it? Shit, I just found the watch
But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day, has me fearing my grandfather clock
And I can't die without trying, my hands tied in knots
Knowing that I'll never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
Love is hampered by thought, if you can handle the prospect of
Death - it's as massive a shock
And to intellects, it's a fuckin' smack in the crotch
It's a cancer that rots your soul, tosses demons off of the road
Just use caution and know, that, love ain't nothing but a loss of control
Off then, we go

Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out
Traces of love, long ago
That didn't work out

Love'll have you nervous, doing stupid shit on purpose
Brain out of service, words slurred when you blurt shit
Studderin', utterin' non-sensical shit in your verses
Feeling like a shirtless four-breasted woman in a circus
Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
So girls create a false world of filling on boys
Exploited, guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
But when you have it, there's nothing like it, you get excited
Seeking those who provide it, on phones talking to psychics
Some fear it, spend their entire lives trying to fight it
Living in a confusing Hayes, like they're grooving to Isaac
It ain't the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
It ain't easily learnable with definitions in tact
It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
Hittin' and bullwhippin you, leavin' them slits in your back
But I've been a lucky one, loving parents, loving friends
But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
But I ain't a genius on it, I can only pretend
Cause over all it's an emotion I cannot comprehend
It's love


Love ain't the basis for action
In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
And the past isn't felt as a match made in hell
But rather its held as a latter day meld
Of common mistakes and nice intentions
But when false love retention is simply vice invention
It's only right to mention the fights you get in
Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
So what's love really got to do with it?
From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
The truth isn't as eloquent so be intelligent
Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it's irrelevant
And that word'll fit like a glove if you don't get right
Now live your life for the love or stop",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-love-aint-lyrics

""A brother got to eat""
""Yeah? Why don't you rap for food then?""

The music makes me high
Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef

Similar to Christ (we got divine reps, so tell me)
If you know your gwan die (why step?)
Show no mercy (when bruising crews)
You get hit with more bricks than New Jerus

So check out how these herbs get touched

the slash and burn techniques

Red fleets, Pulp Fiction style, (leaving your car with red seats)
We make like fly swatters and smash pests

Enemies With Benefits,Oneirology,2011.0,"Trust me, we can make the scene turn ugly
You hate me or you love me, trust me
We can make the scene turn ugly
You hate me or you love me
We can make the scene turn ugly, trust me

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

She the girl of my dreams, also my nightmares
Cause she be jigglin' it, killin' it in her nightwear
Between mean glances that we might share
The space between us is like a lightyear
All in my phone like she AT&T
All in my Facebook pretendin she me
Cus her ""Not Hot"" single friends feedin her nonsense
The ghetto's trying to kill me and my chick's an accomplice
With black gloves (black gloves) black mask (black mask)
Full lips (full lips) fat ass (I like that!)
Text messaging ridiculous comments
I'd have to wash my mouth out to read you the contents
She might literally love me to death
We had a stairway to heaven til' I fell down the steps
Now I'm left with a pain in the neck
But she's my eye candy, the flavor I savor
And I'm part Vader, I think with my saber
I live in crazy town and I'm married to the mayor

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

They call me Lex, junior
Not Rex Lewis
My ex like a six shot shooter - sex ruger
She's a sex cougar
She texts, we bang every time I sit next to her
Man, she get me hard as steel, I call her X-Ray
Coz my ex bust her neck during sex play
I get the cleanest dome, I mean it holmes
She never be at home but she never be alone
Her boyfriend is a punk, he rock a onesie
He think he fly, pullin' stunts in his undies
But she my kryptonite
I know...cryptic right?
I'm sitting back with a pipe getting ripped at night
On my window pane, the coldest rain
My enemy, Miss Lois Lane

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

She’s a devil in a baby blue dress
Who I'm mentally redressing as an angel through sex
Who be testing my mettle - and yes, in a way, I choose the stress
And I guess that I settle cause I’m a slave to huge breasts
But it ain’t worth it
Ask me again if my mind has changed on the situation in five days
And I couldn’t say for certain
And so we stay in this deranged arrangement
Nailing ‘tween the breaks of these unwavering debates of ‘who’s the
Crazy person’?
She got them fuck-goggles on me
My judgement Impaired like I was drunk on kamakaze’s running a busted Kawasaki
Callin the love doctor cause I need a fix of this chick and it’s sickening
Wish I could quit, but my dick is mixing the signals and shit
Half of the time, I see past these disastrous signs
And half of the time, I keep asking if I’m happy to lie
If blame can be assigned, then I guess I’ll have to try this food for thought:
You can always see the shape of the pan in the pie
Savage desire in me to taste her loving
So my peace of mind will never turn into a baker’s dozen
I’m crumbling",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-enemies-with-benefits-lyrics
Beautiful Girl,A Piece of Strange,2006.0,"Uh uh uh uh, I love this bitch, uh uh uh
I love this girl, smack her on the ass, light the hash

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

I tried to stay all the way playa when it came to game
But got benched in a sense when it came to Jane
I can't explain the deep breaths that I take in her presence
Found recollections connect to every ounce of her essence
I love her, til she join with the air up above her
Love so strong it can't be wrong for her to share with another
Long as she touch my lips and my fingers, fuck it, we swingers
Cause it's Jane that keeps me sane
For what the world gonna bring us
Can make a blind man see and forget his doctor's appointment
For her sheer enjoyment I'll even risk unemployment
Can it be? Her first name changed to Calamity
Cause if saw by the law in my car, they grabbing me
Harrassing me, asking me 'where did she come from?'
Have me see a counselor asking questions thats plumb dumb
Trying to steal my love, so now I'm constantly taking shit
Cause now three times a week they wanna test our relationship
Shit!

Jane's all confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E

Yeah, spread them legs jane, I need a head change
Coochie hairs flame colored, sweet lil red thangs
She riddles every area of my brain with deep tickles
Mary, married her, carries my pain? Nope
An angel came to me one night chillin'
Said: ""I won't change you, just tame who's within that Villian""
I said: ""Cool, lets lay up with the stars for a minute""
Next I know we break up roaches from cigars
We done finished
Jane doing things that made me search my soul
I's a young one, she's an old freak that cuts slow
Leave her? Right now you got a hellafied no
I guess I needs her, that double edged ledge cuts throats
I love the please-her, or pleasure, whatever call it liesure
You call her a crutch, y'all hush, I call her 'Retha
Undressin her, loving the resin upon fingertips
Its over when I roll me a Fat Lady
Now sing it, bitch

Jane's all confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane
J to the A to the N to the E
Just a crush on a beautiful girl, named Jane

616 Rewind,Will Rap for Food (Deluxe Edition),2001.0,"Yo, first I sprinkle the verse
By addin' words, rhymes
Flippin 'em in a verse with lines
Then I'mma hit 'em disperse rhyme venom
And then I'mma split 'em in half
Feelin' my wrath
Venturin' through parts of the South so dirty
You'll want to be given a bath
It'll take pathological liar to deny that I'm nice
And the truth hurts (ow)
Wearin' a blue shirt the best buy for the price
To get six guys this live and nice on the mic
So don't diss us because we're fly
Until you try what it's like
I'm liable to slice at these emcee bastards
Leaving their knees fractured
Needin' every piece of their teeth re-crafted 
So don't front cause I see past it
You're harmless like Wolverine's adamantium claws
When they're retracted 
If the scene's backlit
Or seems static, we'll wreak havoc
We'll beat batter to keep rappin'
A leech battle, a dream shatterer
For three nanoseconds 
Count your paces, one step to Tonedeff
You're Gone in Sixty Seconds like Nicholas Cage is

I'll leave you riddled with basics
There's no need for complexity
To be beside myself I need God next to me
Just kiddin'
I'm partially bullshittin'
The only time I take a loss pussy is when I lose kittens
I pitch shit past 'ya, no matter who's hittin'
I don't capsize boats
But I got crews flippin'
You catch it? The message needs analyzation
Step and your boys'll be pouring alcoholic libations
I flew sick, you knew this
I'll puzzle you, doofus
Fuck mentally
Stretch you into a physical Rubik's
It'll take more than sticker rearrangement to change it
His language is so strange, how do we contain it?
You can't just paint this up upon the canvas
Gotta get the mental picture
To begin to understand this
So anticipate defeat, delete chances
Got your heads speared on lances
Doin' burial dances 

I'm giving body language speech impediments
Each uttered threat causes confident cats to stutter-step
Cut a reputation down to sighs too raw for porn overdubs
Plate of leftovers? Eat some warmed-over thugs
A jaded wordsmith bleeding ghostwriter's pens dry
Getting on a rapper's nerves, corroding dendrites
When my thoughts connect, you ought to step away fast
Seems I gave cats ADATs the way they make tracks
Forget a scare, I'm not generous, kid
Spit Society of Nimh and indent it in lids
Indie Pennant is sick and this is just a quick reminder
If you was to pick a cipher then I'll bus your clique to Rikers
All expenses paid, no questions asked
I'll get open in the cut and leave your flesh a gash
Can't relax, man, the last time I took a breather
I got brought up on murder charges, start the crooked fever

Hey yo, I'm not a fella to riff with
I'm so nice Mr. Rogers sued my ass
For copyright infringement
Roll with henchmen
That will switch heads
From wanna be thugs to 24/7 bitch kids
Topping my shitlist
Producting cat bastards wantin' jiggy beats
For some wack rappers
Switch my style? Who you tryin'a play?
My beats'll maraud yo' ass any time of day
Like Deuce Bigalow's chick
Whenever you do shit
People see you and holler ""That's one huge bitch!""
Shit, when the LP rolls out
The Source'll be forced to make the quotables
A three-page fold-out
No doubt, I'm fed up with this wack shit
Bombin' the next kid wearin' Abercrombie and Fitch
And any jiggy rapper actin' fly on the radio's
Gettin' pulled out of rotation like a Firestone radial

Kashal Tee, the hip hop scene I phatten
Not even my winner's belt keeps my jeans from saggin'
It seems I'm braggin'
But fiends been naggin' for my next release
I apply all my expertise and make 'em extra pleased
Even get the vexed appeased, I make any brother feel this
All I do is independent, like double helix
Sellin' out? Well I hope that you're not
But how else could you afford all the soap that you drop?
You can't fuck wit me, yo, kid, look
Takin' me out ain't no small feat, you ain't Bigfoot
You should know who the heck you're facin'
Cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation
Now battle, is that you want to do?
What kind of man are you?
I bet you sit on the urinal too
Now that it's proven to you
They got a lot to tell us
NIMH got your heart skippin' beats like acapellas

I be a cryptic author
Writing poems on tombstones
Celph-Titled, the nigga you couldn't bring home 
I'm at the crib wit your bitch givin' me slow head
Split you up in more pieces than when Jesus broke bread
My clique is raw, be prepared when you meet us
Kill an unborn baby and you still couldn't de-fetus (ooh)
I don't battle with rhymes
I'd rather battle with nines
Instead of using my mind
I'd rather shatter your spine
The closest you ever came to a punch line
Was waitin' for refreshments at the prom in '89
I'm super crafty, super nasty, super raspy
Fuckin' bitches with super asscheeks
You fucking faggots don't know what raw speech is
I beat a bitch until her whole body turn to cleavage
I'm hyperactive so I drink decaffinated
My left jab is fatal, leavin' cats decapitated",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-616-rewind-lyrics
Imperial,Strange Journey Volume Two,2009.0," 
Its about time, like that shit that light up ya wrist
Real niggas keep pleadin' the 5th
Concealed dealings in the heat of the mist
In the jungle where the simians pull semis a-plenty
In the league of the chimps
I'm so for real with bananas and clips
So I fail with the gangstas and pimps
Try'na prevail, quick money attempts
Couple hits, nigga thinkin' he rich
But I was headstrong, dead wrong perhaps
Playin' scenes in my mind when a fiend relapse
Eyes rolled back in they head relaxed
But money feeds the J's to the feet of the cool
And my feet were famished after walkin' from school
Wood heels, smokin' kill with a hooligan crew
Talkin' slick to the fiends, even robbin' a few
Niggas lucky that it's rappin' that he happen to do
Cause oh, lo and behold, it could happen to you

And the beat goes up (imperial)
You can feel it in your lows (imperial)
Imperial rock (imperial)
Imperial roll (imperial)
 
The politics of pushin' potent potion
One toke and I bet I got you open
Peep what I prescribe to my smokers
Give em the proper dosage
Gary boy with dreams like Michael to see the ocean
I was local til the white boy Joseph put me on different coasts
Then he left me for dead, dog
So he could push the pussy pigs Sonic The Hedgehog
The crackers wanna profit off my topics of mockin'
But yo I'm from a small town called
""Bitch when I see you, I'm in yo pockets""
Niggas rock it let it dry, trap, traffic and train hoes
Poppin' my P-95 at polices in plain clothes
The ghetto just infested with felons
So whether its the fuzz or the thugs now you under surveillance
I got a letter from the feds in the mail
That say I'm connected with some niggas that's sellin' yayo
So share some information or you'll be sharin' a cell
""Lock me up and swallow the key, throw me under the jail
Never tell, I'm a gangsta""

And the beat goes up (imperial)
You can feel it in your lows (imperial)
Imperial rock (imperial)
Imperial roll (imperial)",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-imperial-lyrics
The Gates,A Piece of Strange,2006.0,"Tell the Reverend Harris to pray for me, Lord
I ain't gonna live
I don't believe I'm gonna live to get much older

Lights out, so peaceful, stressless
Things used to seem so restless
Forgive me please, see I need to address this
Just haven't been this breathless since I met this
Woman who lept into my life when I was reckless
Mothered my blessed kid, but was destined to exit early
Guess you can say I've been blessed with the best gifts
Reminiscing, holding her necklace in my clenched fist
Ha, it's funny how we move in sudden directions
Dedicated my life to the public's protection
Never remarried cause love's an investment
Besides, I had a baby girl to worry about
That would struggle to blend in
Now as I think, a weightlessness is interrupting my senses
A pulsing tension carries my very frame
I rise up in ascension - WAIT!
I try to escape, but I arrive at these gates
I see a figure standing guard who invites me to pray

I tried it on
At the gates of Hell
I'm going to lay
Down, down

I walk towards the figure that's extending its hand
I move to enter past the gates yet I'm met with its grasp

Slow down son, there's things to discuss such as family
But first, let us talk about vanity

Vanity?? Man, you're sadly mistaken
Either that or your sanity's shaken
If you'd examine me patiently
You'd retract on your statement
I haven't sinned flagrantly, I've acted as faithfully
As any other single father
Who raised a baby girl graciously

Nakedly, she was at your door after her mother's death
Ignorant to racial anger and other stress
Later had a mixed baby at her sweet sixteen
How did that fit within your picnic scene?

Sometimes it's too late to fix these things
The pristine dream was over
Had to face the fact she split these genes with his sick seed
With skin the darkest pigment seen
And so I kicked and screamed
Until we found the peace that distance brings

A mixed raced queen, that was your thoughts about her mama
Up yonder went her soul, your hate growed from ponders
On life, being less trife with a white wife
So any instance of y'alls differences it was slice-slice

Oh my, it's not her race, my daughter's love flies blind
I couldn't take her making the same mistakes that crushed my life
I'm dumbstruck by these baseless allegations
I've saved too many lives of all creeds
For you to paint me as a racist
I've endangered my own safety to save babies from blazes
Black, white, latino, even asian on occasion

But why so?

How dare you question my motivation!

No need to second guess, your only aim was to be famous
Lord knows, you've left behind scorched souls
Black children left chilling, later found burnt whole
So sadly, your glory's to come urgently
Sentenced to fight fires for eternity",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-the-gates-lyrics
Seasons,SouthernUnderground,2003.0,"One two
It's Masta Ace, Cunninlynguists
We about to get into the seasons
The seasons of hip hop
How we gonna start it?

As we spring back to the past, it was all happening fast
We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
When b-boys danced to the latest jam
You could say this man was the greatest fan
When shoelaces were fat, and all the rapper's faces were black
And light-brown, a box with the right sound was all you needed
When it blast, they must move
You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove
And songs started to drop, Ain't nobody start at the top
Before Preme learned the art of the chop
This is way before SP's and MPC's
And long before CD's and MP3's
The game started to bloom and blossom
And masters ready for the cermony, like a groom in costume
Growth from the rain of the previous years
I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears
Yeah

As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner
Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner
""Fuck The Police!!"" jumpin over radio scanners
It was hot in the shade, wet paint all over the canvas
Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's
 
Amerikka's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
It was 2 Live, Florida crews caught heat for rappin'
But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
Strictly 4 My Niggas 
that were Ready To Die in the ride
I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever
To bad we had to have a change in that weather, that shit was beautiful

""Seasons Change, mad things rearrange""
""Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play in the autumn
Any order""

""Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em
See all them leaves must fall down""
Verse 3: 
As the East vs. West winds blew, causing 
two
Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef
Assumed that the worst was over
Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October
The weather's colder, but the word jacket/jack it
Is what they did to people's styles
Not what they covered they backs with
Tactics of the skill impaired
No Limit
 to what they'll do when the green is scarce
Some be Thanksgiving for who they know
While others get jerked for loot
Cause getting signed ain't a turkey shoot
No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that
Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap
Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits
Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs
Born to Roll, so I'm taking you back to school days of autumn
Before the bottom dropped out in 2K

By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains
Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age
No more Gold, no more YO! MTV RAPS
Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks
In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten
Citizens open up shows for 
more snowmen
Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
And artists themselves get treated like Elves
Matter of fact, Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya?
And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia
Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder

""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep

Thirteen circles I've stepped for eternity
Burning purple, stressed on a murder spree
It's self-inflicted, don't get it twisted
These knives in my back now, Elliott Smith(yeah)
Rides in the background, melodies fit (yeah)
Mixed with the misfits, fix is the hurt
When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
French-kiss vixens, distant and cursed
Burned bridges occurred from scriptin' my words
Word, so I'll chisel a verse
On these lie-filled halls that I've lived in and searched
I'm still lost in a head of catacombs
Cause I build walls like I'm Edgar Allan Poe
I've killed off every damsel that I know
For castles that I keep, castles that I know

""—castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep

I'm having spirits in the dark, laying under moonlight
Laughing with a stranger, like I saved her from her doomed life
Pop a couple Percs, a perk of anonymity
Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
A path that I rehearse, a cycle on repeat
Life is like a lion and I'm dying at its feet
I roll another sweet, check my muted Treo
I've seen them as the plot, too busy caught up in the B-roll
My eye up to the keyhole, scared to turn the knob
And go out on my own, instead I blend in with the mob
My memory bank's the only thing I tend to rob
And every time I phone the lob, I'm out of dodge
It's hard, on the boulevard, and other clichés
The type of bullshit that I'm feeding self these days
Corrosion on my relays, one thing my mirrors chose
An imp in new clothes, exposed

""—castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep
We will sleep""

I mow a dead lawn, aim for the alpha
Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
Not a man, a receptacle for crest-fallen matter
Never tempered or pressed into patterns
But just won't die, instead a palpitation from the plasma
Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at 'em
I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
Then off into my extremities and out into the public
In a flood of shadow puppetry, something in the air
Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self-aware
It's recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
Close encounters exacerbate his condition
From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
Tune into the Casio adventures
When the rest of me can barely form a god-damn sentence

""—castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""
""His castle we will keep""
""Clean them, sell them""

Folding under pressure ain’t get us to where we at
When all hope’s lost you battle to get it back
In fact, dark times are when heroes shine
Without them sour grapes there would be no wine
Let your ego dine, adversity for breakfast
Zero pride, in settling for less then
Fighting tooth and nail, no matter who prevails
Instead of wishing on a star grab a comet by the tail
Your ship ain’t coming in, then you got to make a sale
Catch the wind and make it sail and hit the ground runnin’
Til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin’
Those talking ‘bout failure ain’t talkin’ ‘bout nothin’
You may weather the storm if you don’t stop punchin’
Reach for the stars and you might just touch ‘em

Stars shine, stars shine
When you think you’ve lost your way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day
Stars shine, stars shine
Coming out to light the way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day

Our money’s funny, our change is strange
These days ain’t sunny and the sea ain’t tame
We playing games where the rules ain’t clearly defined
In this coffee black world, knee deep in the grind
Be a vine in the shade, a salmon in a stream
Try lookin’ for the stars when examining your dreams
Could go from street singers to pop figures
From block niggas to a brotha that is followin’ stock tickers
To grow in the night you gotta create light
Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight
No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam
And you don’t need a telescope to detect dream
You blessed with a mind that can see through space
On dark nights, in the stars you can find your face
Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light, light

Against all odds and against the grain
Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain
In monsoon proportions them moments of importance
When victory’s in vain it’s the same the blood coursing
Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment
Poised when them black clouds come ‘round don’t back down
Let haters be theme music playin’ in the background",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-stars-shine-brightest-in-the-darkest-of-night-lyrics
Mic Like a Memory,Will Rap for Food (Deluxe Edition),2001.0,"""I shine in spaces where time is just a glare""
""—hold the mic like a memory""

There was a time when I couldn't find energy
The only person that was feelin' me was Mrs. Hennessy
It's like life was pinnin' me down
I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
You ain't gonna be a rapper, you're not a factor
You just a Kentucky boy, get yourself a tractor
Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
That's when the liquor and weed became a need
Self-esteem was lower than snorkel cities
Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel’s titties
Then as soon as I started getting some pride
My sister hydroplaned and died on I-65
In a family full of pride, house full of tears
Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
Heart full of fears all jeers, no cheers
'Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear

""I shine in spaces where time is just a glare""
""—hold the mic like a memory""

I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
Can't grow fond of past memories
'Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
Offended by the mental imagery
And suggest livin' in poverty was really meant for me
Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
I can't begin to see how to control the flash backs
Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
When I don't perceive what I feel I deserve
Being slurred by those not livin' in my position
My thoughts tend to glisten, just like a pot to piss in
And when I thought I'd risen, life freezes the frame
So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain

""I shine in spaces where time is just a glare""
""—hold the mic like a memory""

I sit back and reflect, on the wild paths in my life
Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
You know what blasphemy's like, cursing at God
'Cause you ain't got shit it hurts and it's hard
Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
Most of my life's a daze got me forever lighting haze
Tryna forget the times, where I barely ate twice a day
For, alone and helpless, so when I only felt the shame
Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
Few friends even then, most homies is fake
Feel like a prisoner in my home, pencil my only escape
I went from the block with my fam, to college exams
But the pressures still there, dog I'm still scared
But I know it will all be right in the end
As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen

""I shine in spaces where time is just a glare""

Drunk Dial,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"Operator here's my dime
Connect me please
I know that she's at home

It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone?
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
I’m in jail I need bail. Again, the word is bond
Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
So what up?
Can you free me ‘fore my prints get back?
And they run em through the system and realize that I'm black
All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack
Said her name was December than she sat on my lap
""Merry Crimmuh""
Liquor and higher power my witness
I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness
With all these nice drinks, compliments of Dennis
Whoever the fuck that is
""Dennis is this!""
Two middle fingers up
""Dennis is this!""
Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths
Whoever the fuck Dennis is, Dennis is pissed!
Cus I don’t think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all, fam!

It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone?
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

Ha, Yup
Im aware it’s four in the morning
But I just wanna tell you im drunk and im kinda horny
I know it gets annoying, but I been losing my grip
Every woman I talk to I treat like a therapist and it’s a bitch
Mainly cuz I now consider you one
I wanna let you go, but every time I seem to screw up
Now that’s the problem with the space that you occupy
It’s going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind
A box of wine and a carton of coffin nails will
Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin’
Like ""Hey bitch! How the hell have you been?
Remember me? We were dating and you slept with my friends!""
I just thought that I’d remind you in case you ever forget it
And train yourself to believe that you're not a terrible wretch
Ha
You broke my heart into like a million pieces
So here’s another dim-litted picture of my penis

Whoa!
What the fuck is going on Grieves
You saved my number under the wrong name in your phone?
Is that a picture of your...?
I'ma pretend I didn't see that
All that rain got you suicidal up in Seatt...ohhhhh
You had to much to drink again
Whiskey and a cellphone ain't never gonna be your friend
You booze you lose, homie you been warned
You better off using your cellphone to watch porn
Grab some lotion & a napkin
Jack off then pass out
All these drunk texts'll have you fucked off and ass out
I hope you black out before you do anymore damage
I checked your timeline, homie...why you Tweetin in Spanish?
I understand if this is what you gotta go through
But when you sober up I got some screenshots to show you
Grieves, bro trust me
And you gonna be hella happy that all of them texts didn't go through

It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone?
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

Ooh! Ahh!
That's the angle

Never Know Why,A Piece of Strange,2006.0,"Put her out in the cold, didn't want her close to he
Cause his granddaughter's different than she suppose to be
Diluted her genes, it stopped the music it seemed
That they'd only seen polluted stream, and that wasn't clean
Said he could almost no longer stand the breath
From this pure horror, more worse than Amittyville
So what's next? Don't answer me yield. (yup)
This is a normal occurrence, not something randomly real
Ain't even allowed visits over a child's pigment
His in-crowd ignant, a situation ""wow!"" isn't it?
Hard times, baby daddy grinds to support
His mother and a few other friends privately in her fort
For short stays, ya know? but more aid was needed
Baby is like a year and a half now and speaking
More than I can say about that man with his child
They can't even come face to face and share smiles
Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
Like she spawned a fucking anti-Christ or a Satan infant
Blatant mentions about family blood won't leave
Love's her deeply, but evil sends it's opposite feed
""old fashioned""
Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
If he could just set it aside, there'd be heaven to pay
Then, weathered and aged time swept him to grave
Love conquers all? shit. I'd say that areas grey

Old fashioned people they never know why (2X)
Old fashioned

Most don't even know why they believe what they believe, man
Never taking a second to look at life
Bad water in our seeds, y'all, still growing weeds, dawg
In the dark, walls blocking all that light
Most don't even know why they believe what they believe, man
Never taking a second to look at life
Bad water in our seeds, y'all, still growing weeds, dawg
In the dark

Looking at life in retrospect it's hard to regret
Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
And even though nobody's life is ever perfect
You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
Pondering the purpose of living, the curse that was given
Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
People who pimp children are really raping religion
The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
But now the technology follows me solemnly
Building the future laws to my philosophy
Alzheimer's cutting through like a lobotomy
Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
I survived disease and political crisis
By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
And now I live vicariously through my kids
Like people who love the sport, but can't play for shit
Fighting glaucoma, front the cops taking a hit
I slip into a coma, roaming over the planet
Leaving the gold and the granite, the old and the famished
But just before I vanish, as I think I’m right at the end
The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
Yeah, nigga, remember way back when—

Old fashioned people they never know why
Old fashioned people they never know why
Old fashioned people they never know why

Take you through church in a verse til you view fact
Holy ghost, from the lowly coast, spit humility
Facin critics cold fronts, blockin our humidity
(We own rap) fo sho as Cognac’ll twist yo dome back
Our tracks? See, they be nappy (but you can’t comb that)
Call it el natural sound of soul
You ain’t seen these darts or how fast they’ve flown
(From, ‘tween these parts and the ones ‘nere known
My slang bang with a twang and hang on earlobes
You hear Natti, hot as Caddies with no steering column on ‘em)
With enough lines to dry all the clothes that you own
(Since when did the south) get pinned in a drought?
(Not never been clever since big pens been about
Reachin whateva levels that’ll suspend any doubt
That we as bad as yo kids when this mics to our mouth)

I might switch, south-paw), knuckle to jaw
(If another broke nigga spit about spendin it all
I spit the gems that you splurge to put around neck
So save that to pay back all your loans and debts)
A Maybach and a plaque, is that all you get? Shhhit

Standin on southern dirt that helped America get rich
Ye’ ain’t gotta struggle with a shovel to dig this
Cold as no power, after hours in the winter months
Hot though (crock-pot flow)
So here dinner comes
Walk them shell toes down underground railroads

You ain’t feelin sickness served?? muhfucka kiss a curb

Hypnotized,Strange Journey Volume One,2009.0,"They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized
 
You know, I don't know if it's the ganja
The Red Stripes or the Appleton Rum I've been drinkin' but um...
 
Shorty
She do the damn thing
Fine as champagne
Hot, and the way that she trot
She only fan flames
A Super Freak, but please don't call this man James
If she put it on me, bet a nigga pull a hamstring
The type of strange that makes you forget your name
Amnesia to a player, she makes you forget your game
Coach
She got me caught up, like an alley oop
I can ride at Sally's like a jockey but she got me spooked
I'm feeling like a youth but
To tell you the truth though
I do wanna crush
It's
A little more than lust
Trust
I'm no Goodyear gimp
But she got me stumped
Lookin' Bubba Gump tryna Shrimp
I was a pimp bitch
Mixed with modern day Romeo
But today my pimp look more like Polio
Overdosed off of beauty got me comatose
Shorty so blessed makes the Reverend catch a holy ghost

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized..
 
The way her booty sway got me caught up in a daze
Wish it was maze, I'd get lost in it for days
Cause I be so amazed when it's jiggling in waves
Her body so sweet, I bet she sweat glaze
I'm long as three shoes while I'm staring at her boobs
But I be swimming in a gaze and made my inner tubes
They keep me so amused
Like two new Rubik's Cubes
Twins so perfect, so easy to confuse
Her stare is therapy for me forgetting all my problems
I'm victim to a vixen when swishin' in apple bottoms
Switching my position, trying to sit where I can spot em
Got em
Right there in my line of view
And then she caught me, but she smiled like she was so amused
Then she spoke, ""your girl is right behind you, fool""
Snapped me out of it
Kinda slapped me out of it
Hypnotism is my prison, someone get me out of it

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized
 
She said he name was Gwendolyn
The only reason I remember it is cause it rhymes with pendulum
And that's the way her hips were swayin'
Otherwise, I can't recall a word her lips were sayin'
Damn it y'all I'm mesmerize
Her eyes they got me hypnotized
She got me shaking my head
But I ain't saying no
Lookin' her up and down, but I ain't nodding yes, I'm saying, ""Woah""
I see her mouth movin'
I think my mouths open
Hope I don't start droolin'
Shit is in slow motion
I gotta say somethin'
""Uuhhh""
Nice goin'
Snap out of it player okay
Time to focus
""Did you just pinch yourself?""
""Cause you'se a dream come true""
I grew an inch myself comin' up with things to do
Oh shit she didn't slap me
Imagine that
Fuck it didn't happen
I just imagined that
Shit I blew it y'all
Where'd she go? I can't believe it
I hate to see her go
But love to watch her leavin'

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized

Violet (The Upper Room),Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today to celebrate an electric life
Under violet sky
I pray you hear our cry
Please help us protect what’s right (Amen)

""There ain't nothin' in this world that could take your place""

Gather your thoughts, gather around
Painted arrangements mixed from a pallet of sound
A casket froze in indigo, royal and profound
Many stems like hymns once blossomed from ground
But while the reaper is king, we carry the crown
We weigh it out, dreaming, screaming or close to even
In this sense nobody's perfect, nobody is worthless
The system's imperfect, maybe we should measure in purpose
What is yours? What is mine? When do we serve it?
Being hood ain't the absence of good
Being square don't make you equal or fair, it's not an equal affair
Weak voices can't speak for a share
Speak choices with no when or a where, are you aware? I don't think so
Unless your cup runneth over and you still sip slow
Or guzzle til' nothing, complaining when you don't get mo'
See another's glass empty and you don't think poor/pou
r

The upper room is calling
What are we supposed to do?
There ain't nothing in this world that can take your place
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just for you
There ain't nothing in this world that can take your place

Faith, we treat it like a four letter word
While fear, we shout it through the ghettos and burbs
Hear me my Lord, come settle my nerves
I pray these words bring honor as the heavens observe
And to the sky where the birds will testify
Freedom’s a state of mind be free any day or time
Reality will make you doubt your actuality
The truest fallacy is man can’t change how he sees
So it’s death to reason
, it’s left the legions
Wondering where to pledge allegiance
This is my letter to Ephesians
, the rest, we need them
Through death, the best are leavin’

The upper room is calling
What are we suppose to do?
The upper room is calling
It appears it's just for you

Some people play the victim, some people play the fool
Some people pay the dealer while others pay the dues
I don't know what's realer, the struggle and the strain
Or the guilt that can be built within when making gains
Ain't no cheatin' death, you can't lie to life
Plus everything about you’s hiding in these satellites
Outside of the one day that Adam had it right
Humans are parasites, insatiable appetites
""So where do we go from there?"" You ask
I think we all trying to figure that out?
One nation under a God kickin' us out
‘Cause America took and takes the infamous route
As we state from state to state let’s be great again
Let’s forget the salient struggle of each alien
Parade after you honor the graves
Of natives, slaves, women, gays

Nothing to Give,A Piece of Strange,2006.0,"Been, down. Been down
Late at night, what's gone wrong?

Niggas be killing, why?
Because late at night, the bad don't seem so wrong

Nightfall is curtain call for underhanded theatrics
Slugs travel through gun barrels
From hands that had practice
While rapist take the darkness
And make alleys they mattress
Jonesin' junkies twitchin among hookers with coochies itchin
Spreadin disease, spreadin they knees in different positions
In the abyss is children that get lost in the mix
Gunned down for fresh kicks or oppostie colored fits
Its demons brewed lewd manners behind tints
""Whats gone wrong?""
People sitting in position to help with distorted views
Only experience doses of night that's on the news
Or BET showing the glamour without the blues
Or MTV helping you pick out Jessica's shoes
Just construes how you're living, confusing your vision
Nights a politician because only the truth is what's missing
Dirty cops fight crime with dirtier ammunition

When them lights low and ain't no night glow from the moon
Scoundrels run towns, no hounds to hunt them down
Keep your sight low and get your life stole by some goons
Swindlers injure you, a criminal's heart's miniature
Men in the dark paint sinister art in the park
Son of the morning star? Stringing hearts like a harp
Playing melodies of jealousy, felonies strummed by
Hell and it's philharmonic, bewitching our young guys
""Whats Gone Wrong?""
We no longer seek light to give us power
That voice gets hushed by the rush of the Witching Hour
The touch of the wicked cowards that lurk in the dusk
In even-tide, heathens rise, searching for bucks
Anonymous and corrupt, assure obscurity
In a spell under it's veil, an impure security
We love it in our spirits cause we're suckers for lust
Most even fuck in it, we're too ashamed to be just

Looking Back,Oneirology,2011.0,"You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
Part of my shine comes from the distance
You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
Is this business emotionally invested?
Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
Love is war, sex is a weapon
The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'
Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene
To make x-rated into nc-17
Then see everything she got she not shy
Our love below so dro we most high
Then wears off when what we wear's on
Again I turn away when what we share's gone
So...

If this is not the hardest part
I wanna part
Before it gets too deep
If passion dies within routine
I'll come clean
Leave me be, baby

Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Looking back

Under the twilight, and we living the Miller Highlife
La Petite Mort, my lady we bout to die twice
I won't' surrender and you won't surrender yurn
Whatever happens after this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
We wired for desire, dangers to ourselves
Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
My muse, sleeps deep within time
I go to her for credit though I need to decline
It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
I'm sorry it's just the way we designed
My dear we should leave here, I'm talking bout one at a time though
Cause you got me changin' my mind slow
Leave here, says that voice in the back of my spine
As I awake and the moment rewinds

Dreams,Oneirology,2011.0,"Yeah, I know it gets hard
But we made it this far
And we never gonna stop
Even when we reach the top
Of our dreams

I'm tryna reach the top of my dreams
That's why I'm mapping out the script
And slowly plottin' my scenes
They never get the picture
Even when they're watchin' that screen
That's why they underestimate me, cause I'm not what I seem
I'm quite different - entirely focused on making wise decisions
I'd rather risk a huge mistake than spend my life wishin'
I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
Cause when you're gone, it's just that coffin that you lie stiff in
Six feet under, makes me wonder
If I could go back in time and try to fix each blunder
That I made when I was younger, way before the hunger
Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number
See, I'm achievin' every part of my goals
And I'mma stay the same, no matter how far that I go
I think bright, even though inside I'm dark and I'm cold
Feel the pain in my heart and my soul - but I'm livin' my DREAMS
HOOK

At last rap has it’s Dr. Parnassus for the masses
Living a dream with a atlas as my mattress
Living a dream ‘cause the rent is fantastic
Haters get evicted on a daily basis
Middle finger notice waved in their faces
Let the door hit em where the good Lord split ‘em
PS...P players you missing the big picture
Get a million inch screen let your dream be seen
The world is a stage let your dream be scene
Backdrop and props for the finer things
Enjoy the spice of life on your fries and wings
And wash it down with something imported
If domestic ain’t the best at making you feel important
Aim high, poppin’ bottles will get boring
I can have Caviar dreams and Champagne wishes
Or a catfish sandwich with Champagne the stripper
Its my dream

Claim a victory for entering this world earth
Then play your symphony from city to the rural dirt
Beyond hurt, invert your neural confines
I hit the lines like I'm running in the combine
Intramural of the money, drink ya night caps
Dream big nigga, play that shit in IMAX
My dream theater's a perpetual climax
Make miracles, give me water I'll give you wine back
The troops in Iraq, Haitians in the Carib
Or my Arabs, who keep the faith and wear it like a scarab
Dreams prepare ya' for living they hold the key to life
Gotta be the sheriff when you have 'em try to read 'em right
Don't be impressed by things
That haunt ya' when you sleep at night
Just rise above it, right in public, catch an eagle flight
Tap that passion that's within ya and just let it breath
I heard it whisper words of wisdom would ya let it be
Please... Let it be",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-dreams-lyrics

The lifestyles of the scandalous
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (ha ha ha ha)
Look at all the angel dust, the cocaine and the cannabis
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (he he he he)
Hate stones, but the man you trust

Gone off that gangsta gangsta (2X) (and so on)

While Eddie Nash controls bankrolls in Wonderland
Tony Soprano hits channels and holds down On-Demand
We wanna see it and some motherfuckers gon' wanna be it
Others are doing numbers that breed it, bleed it, can't defeat it
Bush, the political gangster, man you gotta be high
Gave plenty of orders for slaughters ain't swatted a fly
Modern day cowboys with shiny alloys for side arms
Hiding behind bombs, advanced cowards
In Jesse James ways we handled the Towers
Guns blazing for freeze framing the King of New York
In the moments we face opponents give thanks to ""gangsta""
Maybe place Babyface Nelson in ranks to bank ya
Got enough angst to handle the handle and squeeze the trigger
But pop that in the city its ""Freeze Nigga!!""

There's something about a vandal's lust
The lifestyles of the scandalous
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (ha ha ha ha)
Look at all the angel dust, the cocaine and the cannabis
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (he he he he)
Hate stones, but the man you trust
Cause its fun to watch cannon's bust
Ain't nothing like it - america loves gangsters (we we we we)
Gone off that gangsta gangsta (2X) (for so long)
Gone off that gangsta gangsta (2X) (and so on)

A-scare-ica lusts danger, danger, danger
War, load the tanks up
In the name of the Lord give thanks for anger
More major paper in ""Gangsta"" Gangster
Heats nerves and veins hearing words from pranksters
Anger anchors us, cinematic screens spew
Wrangler language, systematic schemes too
Change the brain up, divide and conquer
Mob on em, ride till their lives are contra'd
Monsters, driven by capital as a stimuli
Can never be too powerful, it makes us all admire you
We'll follow until we fall like fallen star from sky, I
Can't say it's impact hasn't hollowed walls inside my
Heart, my art, ummmm insane
Is it that smart to react dark when facing pain?
You ain't that hard, that scarred or that real
To go that far, for that kill, for that feel, now that's ill

It's 6pm again
And I'm tuning into CNN watching marines mow down
Crowds with machine guns
16 weeks training, Atilla the Huns philosophies
And now they're thinking we won't bring peace to these
Streets with the same techniques that shit's hypocrisy
This ain't Democracy it's a Survival of the Fittest
A country built behind closed doors with gods as their witness
Picture this
People can become so blind that their ears can't listen
Trying to save their souls with penitentiareligion superstition
Never done unto others but claiming that they're Christian
While God's children are sittin home praying and wishing
For answers to their questions
Herd of the Armageddon wondering what side that we're destined
Life be a war ain't no time for restin
That's why you give up your seven to five, just to stay alive
Trying to fuel the fire inside before the God in me has died
Eyes, wide, trying to look out through this labyrinth
Hoping to leave this earth with the same presence that we came with
Trying to steer my path in opposite on opposite directions
That man came went
My soul came, spent, I tried to get it back
Thinking that if my heart stopped that my body could relax
But there's no time to be laxed
Because there's a war all through creation
God's Warriors are dying and gangsters are their replacements",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-america-loves-gangsters-lyrics
Close Your Eyes,Strange Journey Volume Two,2009.0,"""Close your eyes
You will see""

Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
I feel weathered, but feel like I've been driving forever
Showin' up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
I've been better, but all things pass
This life is taking everything away but you're provided with your past
So fuck it--I stick to having dreams on the road
But until this dream is done I'm gonna keep my eyes closed
And breathe, breathe when it snows
Breathe when I'm forced to live a life with a person on a phone
Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin'
Leave with the seasons
Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
Cause after the show when the last star shines
I can make this all better when I close my eyes

I'm in another zone where troubles gone
Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
A place where life is easy for everybody else
I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
But we don't know it where we don't show it all
For life ain't protocol, under sky, over law

I'm in another space where all the food is good
And there's enough for everybody in my neighborhood
Where all the grass is blue, where we don't know 'bout green
Cause money ain't a thing I pinch myself it's not a dream
Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldn't mean a thing

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You will see

Between climbing and finding it not worth it
Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
I'm so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
I think of home when I close my eyes
So done with the smokes and fries
Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
Drinks I shouldn't drink, things I never write
Cities I never liked now it's like aight
Got merch table weirdos, bros who want to cypher
Girls who want to fuck, but not vice versa
My work is love no complaints I'm fine
Its been a long night can't wait to close my eyes

I dream of an industry ego-less
And free from the modern chains with these chains we're so deep in love
Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
Dreaming a publicist wasn't 2 G's a month
And where it's not about numbers and math
And I was content with really just a couple of fans
And my happiness wasn't relying on tours and a van
Merch sales, iTunes, MySpace and a band
With the front, front row stadium packed
And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
And scream at them ""Look at me now, look at me man""
Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
Fuck being humble, humility is a step in the past
I woke up and realized it was a dream
Wide awake in the rap game, but life I'm asleep",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-close-your-eyes-lyrics
Get Ignorant,Oneirology,2010.0,"You try to get success directly
But there is one to destroy us
Sometimes the way is of need
Perhaps you may get ignorant

Do I gotta get ign'ant and show my pigment on the job
Slap the darkest part of my hand across jaws
These days and times with jobs hard to find
You gotta work a salt mine or work an assault 9
Most folks barely staying afloat through proper channels
And think the rich sit with black candles and slaughter mammals
And run the globe with mind control and designer sandals
But life's a skinny bitch, it's a struggle to get a handle
I'm about to just break bad, like Malcolm's dad
Be Meth Boyardee with a lab and a yellow cab
So I can get my picket fenceand and  yellow lab
That American Dream makes me wake up and scream
That consist of old money buying shiny new things
That I'm about to break as I'm creating a scene
You can use as an anthem for Kanye's tantrums
Cause I'm about a thumb and a finger away from snapping, DAMN


I'm early e'ry day, never took a vacation
Through mandatory overtime I always stay patient
Through all the petty dramas I'm calmer than a sloth
But the shit don't change like if Obama woulda lost
I done worked my ass about 2011 years
And I'm usually far from anything that heaven fears
But I'm feeling off-kilter. I ain't about to kill ya
But I am about to loosen up this filter. Here's you:
Jerking off to Halle Berry on the shitter
Then firing a nigga cause he's checking on his Twitter
You mad cause nobody's tagging you in all the pictures?
Well here's a good one of you tagging your wife's sister
Like THAT- See I been knowing ways to fight back
Vimeo of you saying you don't like blacks
Clearly though, full HD and in stereo
Your network's got holes, my dude, cheerio!


Look, success is just a thought but it can push us to the edge
Put it in our heads at an early age like the Pledge
Give our allegiance, while your at it give your souls
Won't tell you til you're grown that all that glitters ain't gold
Love to watch 'em race, love to watch 'em chase dreams
So dirty there ain't a cycle that you can make clean
Got the athletes juicing, singers getting naked
Rappers spending all they money before they even make it
Actors scared to age, shooting acid in their faces
Slaves to the ratings, every show is more tasteless
Faithless as angels cutting wings from their scapula
To trade it all in and be Dracula

Genocide in East Africa, but you watching Battlestar Gallactica
Filling up the data in the back of your digital camera
Taking glamorous shots of your mammaries
Surrounded by Vanity Fair magazine
And stuffed animals in the house your parents paid for
Built by hand on land people slaved for
Get ignorant, stay ignorant, in fact
Get belligerent-- If you feel my sentiment, attack
Keep kicking it, screaming for your sense of entitlement
Flip me off with the same hand you hold the Bible with
All that botox, every cream, every vitamin
Can't cover up the ignorance that's inside of you
I wouldn't lie to you
It can't cover up the ignorance that's inside of you",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-get-ignorant-lyrics
My Habit (I Haven’t Changed),Oneirology,2011.0,"I'm on an island when my family speaks
As I palm trees
High as the sun of a beach
Right here, quite near to perfecting my speech
But my sleeping habits on average keep me missing my sheets
Yeah
In the studio blazin the beats
Or clubbin with fly birds, rubbin squeezin their Tweets
Flaked on my intervention, I've been missin for weeks
On an international binge with the friends that I keep
Then come home and roam around in my PJ's, for three days
Eatin sour cream n cheese Lays
Relapse itch hit, I'm scratchin like DJ's
Tracks in my veins show I'm feenin for replays
You say free bass? I'll be right there
I like mine with a nice cut and light snare
Get it to me rapido and I might share
Rappin makes me happy so, why stop why care
I'm hooked

I'm up every morning with my mind on a fix
Fire up the midi and let it slide in my mix
Takes from the craziness, I hide in it's bliss
Ride or die, protect my pride, the lioness mane
And I ain't talkin 'bout Jane, I'm playin Rick James
I'm talkin' bass head, nigga, let the shit bang
Moving keys, looka-here, watch us flip game
Ever since a minor the accord has been this strange
I'm in the dark with the black notes
I take humanity and capture it in rap quotes
From the cellars and alleys with the crack smoke
Through the middle to the top where the fat floats
Let's roll, nigga",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-my-habit-i-havent-changed-lyrics
Never Come Down (The Brownie Song),Strange Journey Volume One,2009.0,"""I can't stop"" (Never)
""I can't stop"" (I've tried)
""I can't stop"" (Can't stop)
 
I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down
 
Too much pot in the brownie pan
Got me baked faster than the brownies, man
Have you ever been high from the inside out?
On the lawn in my boxers like the insides out
Carjack a Care Bear and just ride out
In one of them cloud whips with the OnStar chip
I'm so high, I hope you understand this shit
Jane was plain til' I ate her then she came too quick
Drink water while I'm rhyming but I still can't spit
My mouth is pure cotton like a t-shirt coughin'
If baked means potato then my brain is au gratin
Talkin to myself with my neighbors all watchin'
But going in the house proves way too hard
When I fall in the front door and land in the back yard
Physics don't apply, 
midgets in the sky
Skippin' round my head saying"" ""Negro you so high!""
Damn
 
I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down
 
Said I'm eye to eye with sky gods beside Horus
Feeling like that white man singing in the chorus
How'd I grow to be the tallest tree in the forest
Without putting green in a shell like a tortoise, huh?
Rigor mortised, higher than a lions chin
If this was symphonies I'm way up there with violins
If its a choir then, soprano octaves
In an opera, where God lives
Look, I know I'm soundin' like a liar but
These brownies was angel sex
Got a nigga high as fuck
I smoke trees ins through all four seasons
But I'm like gas prices, high for no reason
Call a nurse your boy's higher than Google Earth
And if I fell the impact would put me through the dirt
So let me zoom in, and get my zoom on
This weed is Neil Armstrong I'm on the moon blown
 
I can't stop feelin' high
I'll never come down
I just wanted me, some regular weed
With regular stems and regular seeds
Cause this shit here...

Hard as They Come (Act I),Oneirology,2011.0,"I’m a monster that don’t reside up under your bed
I’mma march to the beat that I put into your head
Send shots to your liver I deliver you death
You can barter your tomorrow but a martyr you’re left
Get you hot under the collar when my name’s on your breath
Click the starter on your Impala I’ll be there when you wreck
Fucking with me you better keep your feelings in check
Be the life of the party or a lifeless body
Get with me thinking you hard, you’ll be hardly standing
I’m the hardest of them all, you’re the hardest landing
Face first in the asphalt, your ass talked
Too reckless, now you helpless from the rounds you caught
I’ll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk
Have you hostage in the hospice, high and trying to walk
I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass
I got the government’s approval, prohibition couldn’t last
I go hard

C’mon lets ride out
The whole family over for Christmas dinner
Let’s go through the purses and sell the gifts from your mom's house
They know you out here doing dirt for cash
Plus you the one unemployed, a couple dollars ain’t gon hurt they ass
I’m the only friend you got
You tried to sell me but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn’t stop
A couple of sniffs would get you lit but couldn’t get you to the top
Oh what an event when you got hip to cooking me into them rocks
I had you locked, you know it costs to come and see me
So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and pawn that TV
And fuck yo life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome
And fuck yo kids, the state’ll separate em’ and place em’ in homes
It’s gonna be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued
Ever since the 80’s played your whole community for a fool
And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes
They field niggas, I’m the definition of death, the real killa

I’m with the fiends on the block playing shoot em’ up
When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust
People scared to test me since the 80’s
Anybody can get it, man woman or baby
Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate
I disseminate, you disintegrate
I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with me
I’ll prolly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me
Cause next to me you’re looking quite frail
And if you snitch you’ll be counting your days in white cells
Just needlessly in CB4, ask the CDC, no CD4’s
Cause the truth is I’m on America’s dick
Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it’s making em’ sick
Now their life’s in a tube, a downward spiral
Give a new meaning to going viral
I’m hard as they come

Then spreads from the stage to the youth
Who all root for more

Where there's smoke there's fire
Similar to the streets, where there's spokes there's tires
Keep rollin like X poppers, see them flames
They gone need dental records to retrieve them names
Of course the sheer force'll scorch upon contact
Zippo flow, here we go, let's all cock back and ""Fire!""


""Fire!"" Melt Antarctica down
Evict polar bears, help bring art to the sound spit
""Fire!"" Like lit cigarette in dry leaves
Goodbye, leave, or die whenever your eyes see
""Fire!"" That burns like a wound with a pool of liquor
Running through it like a molten river
Imagine hell like it's a motion picture
Hopeless folks roasting like it's a joke but sicker
Try living with ""Fire!""
Not like water in mixed dranks
Forget rank, when enemies challenging this tank
""Fire!"" Murder, death, kill with the grill
You've heard the best, don't sit still as you feel this

Doin’ Alright,SouthernUnderground,2003.0,"I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day
I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day

Back in the sixteenth century ... way way back in the day
Nostradamus predicted the end of the world would be on May
5th... 1999 and I don't know how
But as I'm writing this that's only one day from right now
What the fuck
I pull up to Shell in my truck
Look up, ""nah... Earth ain't about to erupt""
Open my door, get up, slam it shut, ""Marv, what up
Lemme get a bag of ice and a stack of plastic cups""
For a minute we chat 'bout life and all o that
Then we dap. 
""Check you out tomorrow night, I'll be back""
Grab a bidi and light it
, turn the key and start driving
Back off into the night and then I start to get frightened
Thinking ""Damn! My whole life I was just a dreamer
I never got to put on a show in a packed arena
I wanted to go on Rap City and act witty
But all I ever did was put up with hoes who act shitty
What a wack pity
Was I choosin a road
That didn't get me there in time and now we're losing our globe?
Hold up, I'm losin control
Think realistically on it
What could fuck up a planet in one day without warning?
And even if the world does end, I can't be mad at God
Cause life coulda been much worse. At least I'm satisfied
At least my dad's alive married to my mother
I have a sister and friends that I could call my brothers
At least I have life. Some people, their life was stolen
Set up for a crime and behind bars is where they hold em
We got kids killing kids cause Earth is cold
Women using abortions as a form of birth control
It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience
But it's a blessing that I made it through this nonsense
So even if this will be my last night
At least when it's over I'll be doin alright...

I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day
I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day

Back in the 16th century, way, way back in the day
Nostradamous predicted the world would be on may
5th, 99, three years later and change
The World Trades frame got struck by planes
Looking like God unleashed his fury and rained flames
Exchanged pain for how America came to fame
Cluthing my brain, my sense of security changed
Usually confidence was pure in me, now fear in my veins
Said ""any of this shit could brang nuclear weapons
...any of this shit could end at any second""
If the Commander in Chief couldn't insure our protection
That's no more additions to my memory's collection
Missing me and my girls matrimonial connection
No child and videotapin' her first steppings
Or growing old and teaching grandchildren lifes lessons
But thankfully I got saved during them church sessions
So I thank God for earth's blessings... health
Not alot of wealth, but alot of peace within my self
Not a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf
Disclipline from loving parents, though they raised me
By the belt
When I was young, I was wild
(life) took it for granted
(nights) living outlandish
(christ) hope he could stand it
Now I do right.. wherever I can manage
The devil was eating me alive but I climbed out of that sandwich
Now possibly on the verge of having everything vanish
Feeling as if I didn't do anything as I planned it
Like I was trying to live my life right, but somebody panned it
But I still had love, when down helping hands lifted
Me up, outta the mud, outta the muck
And outta the dark and attitude when I didn't give a fuck
From them days in the park, alone, drinking gin by the cup
Through an exitless maze, wandering and constantly stuck
The blessings were always there, I just chose to ignore them
Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
Wasn't selfish with them, trying to stretch and contort them
And didn't let the world get to them first and distort them
So as I.. kick back and ponder on armeggedon
And I... spit raps about where my life could've been headin'
I.. admit that.. I do have a wonderful life
So if this night was my last, i'll be doin' alright

I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day
I'll be doin' alright. I'll be doin' ok
And as long as I can live to see another day",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-doin-alright-lyrics

Advance through my imagery, I view my evil deeds
When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory
When I called on Mary J be my serenity
So I don't see that all my enemies resembled me
I'm feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
I'm trying to place but my heart ain't even in the race
I've came far enough that turning' back is time wasted
Imprisoned by fear, I don't need no iron bracelets
What's my fate, how can I escape my heart
Running blind, an open mind could break this dark
A major spark might just make a star in this....

Way under in slumber is my true self shown
A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown
Pane in the windows of a once happy home
I’m a Cheshire Cat laughin’ at the caged birds' song
A caterpillar shroomin usin’ fumes from my bong
To cloud a land wondering what fuels what is wrong
Lust in my loins, vengeance in my heart
Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
I can’t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
Opinions of my health, my self, and wealth go off the chart
My struggle to keep balance ain’t a challenge it’s an art
Outside my sleep is silent ‘cause inside the war is fought
Every night, as I fade to the...

At times it can feel like home is when I'm gone
On only roads we roam, Cali to Rome

Never been one for hugs, but I long
Across time zones for strength from fam
Who are only with me through video and digital camera
Lookin' for answers, seekin' the chance ta
Make up for time that got lost in these stanzas
The click of my heels ain't takin' me to Kansas
Thinkin' bout Tuck got me stuck in these transits

My soul seeks a hand-stiched love and a prayer
Shit, I'm everywhere, but home, I'm never there
And some I care for say I'm February air
Don't even know the mayor's name in my own town
Been makin' noise but forgot how my home sound
""...but please don't leave me standing here, when the winter comes""

Listen up, I've been meaning to say this
I'm not the greatest, I'll never make that list
But everytime I come home, you're still there waitin'
In case I never said it, thanks for your patience
Never got rich and famous, don't get me wrong
There's a lot of different faces that listen to the songs
But there's no big time, never wrote the hit rhyme
Had to roll the highway just to go and get mine
And when I got it, I brought it back to you
Wasn't even sweatin' you was reppin' with a new crew
I don't expect you to hold your breath
Just know you're blessed, and let me get that open chest
Look, you've cried with me, you've tried to forget me
You feel neglected cause sometimes I'm busy
You still hold me down on the Southside, dig me
You always forgive me, cause you're my city

But leavin' you little man, takes a part of my soul
Believe me, daddy know it ain't gon' be easy
Better this then have you waitin' for the state to release me
Seein' me through glass, missin' moments to squeeze me
I'll be damned, I want for you all that I never had

Wanna hold you when you cry, tickle you 'til you laugh

You two and barely talkin' and yet you my greatest fan
I love you more then life, you with me every flight
I leave in dead of night to keep from hearin' you cry
My luggage outta sight to fight off the say goodbye
If you could form the words, I know you'd say ""Daddy, why?""

Born out of a moon belly, first day of doom

Maybe later in an incubator for more care
Alone, get to your home and your cribs set
Put behind bars and you ain't even lived yet
On through the playpens, when will this fate end?
Parents can't make rent, money from the safe spent
Got building blocks out, making a house
Mama with her cheese blocks setting traps for a mouse
You watching her same loving hands that absorb pain, kill
You're learning that life's more than a board game
Still better line up the cubes in your Rubik's tight
Piece the puzzle together, there's holes in your views of life
Only for sure thing is years, but you gotta fight
Keep the wind to your right or hit the pen flying kites

Walk up the rectangle steps, take a seat on the bus
Backpack, pack that sack meal for your lunch
Four cornered blackboard makes you act bored
No use paying attention, now you facing suspension
So it's back on the block and the calling you square
Try to get the label off but you're glued to the cable box
Closed Caption clothes and fashion, so attractive
As you lay on a box spring and old mattress
Choices blocked off, childhood gone
Just future cubicles and retirement homes
But you can't see it happening, live savagely
Only thing you put passion in is Zig-Zag packaging
Swallow Oxycontins to find solace
You need a fix so you hit some blockhead for his wallet
But your gun jams and the cops come to take ya
And now that bullet ain't the only thing thats caught up in a chamber (chamber)

Now locked in city block working Lucifers Lot
Down to box for success, is that truth or is it not?
In your room coping with stress
Smoking Kools from out that box
Shit ain't cool, in detention no flinchin, that shit ain't school
Coke sale for a quick sale, but April Fool!
Now your case is on the docket to face a box of your peers
And them bars they trying to take you to
Won't be nothing like Cheers
Just years upon years, till your last box is near
Without your participation incarceration ain't clear
If the plots you got are flagrant
It's best that you leave em vacant
'Cause there's cells in your mind that'll free you every time
Even the tales thrown in these bars can't be confined
Just be patient, nothing in life is by design

Caved In,A Piece of Strange,2006.0,"I can't hold on, I can't hold on
But I just hold on, I just hold on

Lord why's everybody's puzzle missing pieces
Struggling, grinding, greaseless
No rhyme or reason in sight
I'm seeing the pain off in their eyes
I'm seeing that often we lie, lost in our cries
I'm seeing impatient parents
Blaming unsuspecting children
I'm seeing inpatients critical
Streets are dead from the killings
I'm like damn, blocks hot, not from the ozone
Through camera's cops watch these lil boys hold chrome
Stuck, teenagers, foxes and pups
On blocks rocks in they chucks, choppers watching above
They need love, not snug cuffs, federally fucked
Tis all an orchestration Hans Zimmer couldn't conduct
But whattawedo, most problems dun been discussed
But we talk about actions on the backend, and hush
I guess most of y'all must listen to Rush
Long as you all good, then everybody under you flushed

Everytime I try and help myself
Reaching out and finding no one else
I can't hold on "" ""Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in""
So anytime you feel your soul's in need
Realize you can depend on me
And let's just hold on ""screamin' Jesus save me""

We slipping far under the ghoul yard
In grim tombs we some dim stars, batteries full barred
At birth, but it's hard to stay charged on earth
Cause world wide like girth, the wise are in dirt
Grandmama's used to bus us to church
Humming Hymns
Stretch out a fat meal on the table from something slim
Now we starving, faith on the back of a carton
To find it, follow tracks down arms
And boulevards in the south, park
Watch as mouth art paints audio visuals
Call it rythmical miracles
And parts what your eyes red see
Throwing change ups in your medley through headpiece
Still Judge, but dont Dredd each day, instead feast
Life's an unfed beast that eats bread and meat
That's either your cash or your corpse
So I just pray that the Lord helps me last through these wars
Ya know?

Everytime I try and help myself
Reaching out and finding no one else
I can't hold on "" ""Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in""
So anytime you feel your soul's in need
Realize you can depend on me

Driving at Macy's, pissing in cologne bottles
Getting on a runway, drop-kicking supermodels
Smacking up vegetarians with hamburger patties
Tell an animal activist that I killed Lassie
Pimp through a Hindu temple with a leather suit on
Stomp through a Japanese crib with muddy shoes on
Deacon the Villian, always misbehaving
In hospitals playing concentration with Alzheimer's patients

Yo I walk through the oscars and smack the best actress
I don't give a fuck I'll rip the tags off a mattress
Do a back flip straight off a church steeple
Masturbating to naked pictures of Janet Reno
Slam people into doors, beyond retarded
In a double wide smoking crack with Tonya Harding
Roll into Def Jam drunk smelling like Hog's Breath
Ask DMX why he hasn't found his dogs yet


Send David Duke a video of his daughter inhaling black cock
Tell fiends Marion Berry's crib is the new crack spot
Give a legless man the prize for Foot Locker jackpot
Tell foreigners it's customary to smack cops
I don't give a fuck, WATCH, I pinch boobies tight!
Show Ron Jeremy's best at monastery movie night
Crowds boo me like ""Ghost,"" I'm still flippin wind
The street team's outside slicin their Michelins

I force feed Richard Simmons a big ass bag of snickers
Challenge Christopher Reeves to a game of twister
Dip in your sister's crib with a Darth Vader mask
Violate her and later toss her ass in an elevator shaft
Hate to be crass and I know it ain't right
Unplug an old lady's life support screaming ""follow the light""
Follow what's right? Hell naw, follow what's wrong!
Send Bill Clinton a gift, a new gravity bong


Go on Fanatic and tell the artist he's wack
Find us an anorexic and tell her she's fat
Be at the mall sucking on mannequin titties
Kidnap an Amish family and lock em inside a Circuit city
Tell a priest his nun secretly praise Satan
Switch a hypochondriac’s chart with an AIDS patient
Send Hillary the Bill and Lewinski scene in claymation
Send a retarded kid an Atari kit and say it's a PlayStation

Break into buildings crawl around in heater ducts
Roll through Ethiopia in the Oscar Mayer weiner trucks
Slow enough kids can almost catch up, mouths watering
Then I hit the gas and the clutch, passing em up
Sick, like I overdosed on pills
Ask Darryl Strawberry to autograph tightly rolled dollar bills
I oughta chill but you still might see me nightly
At klan meetings, screaming out ""kill whitey""


Deacon - Yo I give a limbless man a wrist watch

(Yeah, that's how we do it in the south)

Aw yeah, welcome to the South everybody
Creepin up outta the dirty south unexpectedly hittin' ya head
Like a stick of lead whippin' you, flippin' you outta bed
Cause on my block the sidewalk can sizzle an egg
And we as hip hop as a cripple with dreads missin a leg
Visitors get addicted and don't wanna leave
Blowin on trees from Kentucky to the Florida keys
Humidity floats in the breeze
And this is the only place where shorties can go to the beach and grow double D's
Like GOOD JESUS. Let me rub some lotion on your cleavage
Cause where we live summertime lasts about four seasons
Parties are real loud. Car systems got clear sounds
Birds fly here in winter. Chickens are here year round
And they ass is meaner, the grass is greener and tap is cleaner
Follow me and any questions just ask the leaders
And the blunted genius of CunninLynguists spittin it clear
Sippin beer on a postcard like, ""I wish you were here.""

So come on down, show and tell with some southern belles
Tricks with treats you don't keep in a pumpkin pail
Hospitality? we treat our company well
From Kentucky bales of hay way down to Florida shales
Gals with chunky tails, lookin' like something swell
Niggas and negrelles smoked out on country trails
You try and visit actin' ignant and startin' hell
Your trip'll last about as long as the XFL
Here, the weather's hot
Streets? we keep em blocked
Mardi gras in every spot like we live in a land without some clocks
From them Virginia docks, to Mississippi crops
Swing through Atlanta where them switches be liftin' shocks
So please leave all trash in the Herbie-Curby
Welcome to the dirty dirty, home of them purdy-girlies
Birdies ready for flight, dawgs ready to bite
The southern south-paw, but everything is all-right

But in the dirty south everything ain't all peaceful
We still got racist people with inflated egos
Got foul cops shootin at niggas like we some free throws
Rough nights, bug bites from Jumanji mosquitoes
Fiends that hug pipes, drug life, pills and needles
Streets with much hype and some like to kill people
And if you don't want cops cuffin you up after your freak show
Remember jail baits are developed so check IDs, yo
But still the home of black eyed peas, collard greens, that soul food
The home of southernplayalistic pimps lettin they hoes loose
The home of that bluegrass, red clay, zephyrhills
Cadillac grills, battle rap skills
The home of Miami Bass, 808's, and spring breaks
Girls with tank asses from VA to the Lando Lakes
The home of gold fronts, home grown skunk, the home of sippin shine
The home of everything under the Mason-Dixon Line

Beyond the Sun,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"*Gospel Harmonizing*

I arrive to blue skies and green rivers
Traveled the globe amazed how every scene differs
My esteem's on K2, I dream bigger
To Mother Earth I bow, like when a Queen enters
Life's so beautiful, it's musical I sing along
But it's inhabitants so quickly say I'm singing wrong (what?)
Well let's rehearse, I'll sing the hook you take the verse
Let's build a bridge, if you ain't feeling it then let's reverse
We'll make it work over time, with open mind
Hope is dying let's fix the broken so folk can shine
I want to help secure fortress, pass torches
Be boisterous about more than fast Porsches
And staying perched on porches, taking self portrait
After self portrait, you treat it like horse shit
Got all the beauty in this world and you ignore it
For you don't see the trees or the forest, you forfeit

We came from beyond the sun 

I arrived at the third rock from the star that you call a sun
And was greeted by the son of man, standing with the gun in hand
I come in peace, but I cracked up and laughed so hard
I almost fell to pieces, you seem to have a thesis
That you been onward and upward and evolving
Just as sure as your axis is revolving
As evidenced by your new technology
I think you owe your ancestors an apology
You've come so far only to forget
So much more than you know now, and I know how
You've been hitting reset on your history
Dividing and conquering yourself into mystery
It's no wonder why there's so much misery
And suffering, even as the gem of your system
The pretty little sapphire, refracting blue light
Digesting sunlight, sustaining true life
Used to be my favourite little tourist spot
I love the pyramids, now you wonder if I built 'em
A galactic pilgrim, soaking in the atmosphere
Nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live here

We came from beyond the sun ",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-beyond-the-sun-lyrics
The Light,A Piece of Strange,2006.0,"The evil, the good, legal, illegal, what's hood?
We see through people, but we don't look in ourselves like we should
We try to grow in the cold, so busy shoveling snow
That we tend to forget about the light that's warming our soul (x2)
If you wanna be healed then you got to reveal the truth (x4)

Set your eyes on the sun
What has brought you this far? (x2)

Is it clearer in the mirror when you look at your exterior
In fear of your interior voice
Some who the one with good game that cook caine proper
And offer it up to junkies as a choice
Seems to whisper to sistas to switch they mista
Simply to get that financial support
Then turn and make that same supporter beat em and
Mistreat em and leave em after breaking em for the sport
Got a married man licking his lips at ladies of leisure
Loins feelin the fever, rather cheat her than leave her
Love his money too much so it's cheaper to keep her
Cause she's a Teenage Love like beepers and reefer
Ain't nobody on this earth been perfect since birth
Sinning and doin the erk and jerk in Church
Then the next minute be back to puttin in work
Jumpin into them holes not lookin in first

If you wanna be healed
Then you got to reveal the truth (x4)

And say, ""I'm sorry you're blue""
I don't have you
And like true friends
They still come around

I'm waiting for growth to show up if I hope to manifest
3 A.M.? I'm awaiting awake to hear me rest
Fate to send caress and a face that I can feel
With weight from heavy breasts
An embrace that helps me chill
Grace that human males can't feel
Unless he builds with a female until time stands still
When we take off our shells and chill
All before fingers learn bodies like we got blindman skill
She speaks no evil but says whatever
After Shaking up bed-feathers still prays together
On a parlay flip, permanent private party trip
The next Ruby and Ossie Davis, I'm talking great shit
Up walking late, lit. 4:25, high
Her mighty fine thighs silhoutted by sky-rise
Place the know how, behind mine eyes
To take something unfortunate
And show them they're a fortune in my life
Look KY side, lend me a hand, send me a plan
A Remy Shand message of love, tell Cupid we fam'
And to clock something that'll learn who I am
As I learn with, chillin out, watching our hourglass sands

I don't have you
And like true friends
And say, ""I'm sorry you're blue""
I don't have you
And like true friends
They still come around

Spent Pubescent years, blessed with peers I could trust
Spinning records to a game of checkers after dusk
Laughter rushes out of mouth, clutchin my stomach, abs burning
From fast learning, not cash earning
Cause we wasn't really on 'at yet, just yes' y'alling
At this point, our lil' brainchild was hardly crawling
But had fallen enough times to keep a nigga's head strong
Fucked with enough spiders to charm a mama leglong
We's dead wrong, many days and nights
Trying strange thangs
From jane to cane and variants of the same change
Get trapped, you off map, no Peter Pan scenes
Where everythings tight and lily whiter than Klan dreams
Tryna get something ripe, a nice woman queen
Stay strong and fight life, like Sudan kings
Pray to make cents for giving
And make sense out of living
Lord give me patience to gain wisdom, please

I don't have you
And like true friends
And say, ""I'm sorry you're blue""
I don't have you
And like true friends
They still come around",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-hourglass-lyrics
Guide You Through Shadows,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"Yeah.. Listen
Once upon a time fell in love with an aura but the horror
Said she couldn't love me till tomorrow
Oh the disdain when tomorrow never came
I was a moth to her flame named martyr
Met her on the Marta King station oh the irony
So many wrinkles in my mind, in no time, she would iron me out
Help me find what I was about
Give me water that could last in a drought, you see - me
I was lost, in the shadow of death
She had the valleys and peaks and with the shallowest breaths
She told me bout light, took me right to the crest
Showed me darkness, heartlessness parked in its depths
I was kept 'tween them legs where she refereed me
Was confused but her clues brought the best I could be
To the top, when she left
Thought I'd drop
But instead
Tilted head back and watched
You see 

She'll guide you through shadows... And to a star 

Yeah
When you took me by the hand
Friends who disguised they plans
Went from allies or fam
To enemies well I’ll be damned
Oh man, 
light’s so blinding
 dog
Amazing if you’re seeing I without a guide at all
Ninjas will hide in fog, predators close on prey
Sun will come out tomorrow, today he throwing shade
I couldn’t see it
Before I wasn’t hip but then our trip made me believe it
Guided me through darkness where the route ain’t known as scenic I’m seeing
These so called angels cast the shadow of a demon, the reason?
Envy, they want what you’re eating
Like they’re inclined to dine on spoils you been receiving
They ain’t help you grow or give you land to plant the seed in, it’s seeming
They only pick you when they see you are in season
Eden


1, 2, 1, 2
Let the goddesses guide us, goddesses guide us
Yo I’m solely dependent
On the benefits of the soul and those energies in it
Fuel the soul and power the motor
We been the descendants
Ever since she sent us the motive
Witches apprentice
Hold us Aluna by the shoulder to show you the road is
Full of so much you’d never notice
Legend after focus adjust though, and step closer
We kept going so y’all could see what’s floating in the waters
I go with the torch to the farthest corner for its over
We provide guidance, through this form of applied science
Writers alliance, we tryna shine a light behind us
For seekers to follow, beacon keep blinking eternally
This journey is hell that’s why I felt compelled when Deacon hollered
My people need reminding there’s some life lessons
How we the finer specimens of the divine essence
How to find direction whenever dead of night has set in
Challenge your fears
Shadows only appear when light is present
We guide you , we guide you 
Through the darkest parts of life to spark a light or to
Help you to see a few emcees who’s here to fight for ya
Signs of victory reliance on the highest order

Master of war with plasma swords

Mad for the taste of your planet’s core
Gnashed in my teeth, and I plan to hoard galaxies worth
I’m a savage
Bored, naturally, because the lack of sport saddens me
I’m a galactic force!
Who dares to battle when standing before me renders you halved?
When I warp through parallel paths to distort your atom’s order
The Galaxian Matador, dash at me
Within a flash you’ll see packs of me
That’ll be swarming within an asteroid storm
Here is your last chance warning, then I won’t ask no more
Did you get that?
Then I’ll hit you with that celestial bitch-slap

Perpetual impact that your mind can’t shield
Weighing in at a gillion parsons it’s Zarcon Steele
Tentacles tatter your tissue, till torn, tender to the gristle
The pitiful pray for the victim, I evict the veins of the victor
No matter the matter you’re made of it contains the brains that I make haze of
Thoughts you’re thinking you thought are those brought to those that I make slaves of
The pecs your appendage’s pump is the hunk of flesh that I make caves of
Imprint the pattern of Saturn across your face like its make-up

You better wake up!
You speaking of Saturn - you late much?
If you’re reading the data it’s eight months till you see where the flash and the rings of my championships came from
Now you want light-speed?
Say what?
There is no one like me, Likely, so it doesn't take much
If you’re taking up space and you’re in need of a weight cut
I’ll sever your tentacles, then I’ll make ‘em a paintbrush
Staining a blood moon
Creative within one swoop - parted in four
The Cosmic artist of war, you could say that I was Sun Tzu
Plotting the gore
One-Two!
You can hold my weapons, I’ll punch through your core defenses
Then I'm shattering your orbital bone
While knocking the solar wind out of your solar plexus

You're outta your mind, this marble is mine
To break into dust and do as a line
Or roll it with space and lace it with time
Right after I separate you from your spine
I'm here to perpetuate your demise
I savor the hint of hope in your eyes
When I'm done I'm sticking my dick in a black hole and creating the sun
To shine down on your grave from
Wherever the fuck I came from
Pimping this planet from day one
Your earth chose me
Zarcon's so far gone in your galaxy balls deep
Weight of the world, fate has been hurled
Too close within arm's reach",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-urutora-kaiju-lyrics

I had Michalangelo put down the horsehair brushes

Giving villages contact matching blunts with Tonto
Spellin S.O.S. with my eyes closed
Even battled Henry the Eighth with my rhyme flow
And made his wives my hoes

I told Jesus that GZA said sandles were feminine
So he copped some shelltoes and suede Timberlands
Remember when KRS ripped Shan? Do ya homework
That was Amadeus playing the Bridge Is Over

Moses parted two tables with a mixer and played great
With his DJ crates. Before him, we played tapes
I sipped fine wine with Einstein back in the days
M. C. Square was his stage name and he rocked gray braids

That was before we could sit and play, Kid N Play

Rain,SouthernUnderground,2003.0,"""Learn to adapt to the change
Or get washed away like tears in the rain, in the rain y'all""

The saddest thing I ever learned is relationships don't last
Or maybe I just feel that way cause of my past
Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey
Feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me
I'll still see something that reminds me of her
I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur
She found somebody quick. I won't find another for a while
She was about to be my wife and mother of my child
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
And the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
Like everything's changed and suddenly you don't trust her just the same
Then you find out some other man's been fuckin out her brains
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
So much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you literally go insane
And you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

Wise Men say, ""It looks like rain today""
Crackled on the speakers
Trickle down the sleepy subway train

I'll never understand how a girl can say she loves a man
And turn around and have sex with another man
I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand
Than to get interrupted and get a call that she's touching hands
With another man. Oh God! Another man!
I can't even cry. My tears been dry. That's why it's thundering
Hard out tonight and it's dark and it's cold
Cause the angels can hear my cry, and it's all in my soul
And all of them know I've never felt this pain in my past
And it's ironic the first place we made love's the same as the last
In the shower ...
 that's why I put the rain with her name
And my power to trust someone again has faded away
Other girls want me? Tell em it looks like rain today
I wallow in my sorrow, smoke, and watch tapes that we made
And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades
The day I almost gave up everything that I gained
It's crazy how you can have your life arranged
And the day you get engaged you notice she's acting strange
Like everything's changed and suddenly it's on tape and you crumble
Cause you notice on the tape she doesn't kiss you, she just fucks you
That's when your heart starts to feel the pain
So much that you can feel it in your veins and you can't forget her name
That's when you literally go insane
And you feel like you're so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-rain-lyrics
Dance For Me,Dirty Acres,2007.0,"""Dance for me,"" someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily would begin

She was a late bloomer, from Penny to Janet in a blink
Dreamt 'bout being Josephine Baker in the mink
Gold make-up like the Sphinx
Skin made to view
Body ornament, performances sensational
From 
rhythm relation
 to titillation through
Demonstrations of what she's made to do
She always told me that she wanted to dance
The only time she felt worthy of romance, damn
I tried to told her she was worthy a chance
But it's hard to talk to somebody in a trance
I just gave her a glance, enough to sang her blues
Be Pablo to paint her moves
, 
be Langston to name her hues
""Emily dance for me,"" someone said, she curtsied and turned her head
She posed, with knowledge and grace she gave us a taste
With a look on her face that could be taken for dead

""Dance for me,"" someone said
Emily shakes her head
Knowingly, gracefully
Emily would begin

Are we crazy, deranged, to stand up for some change?
Dreams turn to schemes, which marionette pulls your strings?
Emily's enemy was Emily, feelin' me?
She only lusted the heel-toe kick to the symphony
And now she justified, cryin' rivers for sympathy
Which in end she finds out is simply misery
No mystery, her OnStar on destiny's roads
Ballerina wardrobe glowin' under the strobe
Twirlin' amongst dollars waitin' under the pole
For a slightly possible goal sometimes we sell out our soul
Can't help that, errrbody done felt that
Just ask your favorite artist whose heart has turned to pitch black
Ask some of these stars where they lost they sense of self at
Strictly being puppets in public is a setback
Yeah fam, that's Emily's energy

Dying Breed,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"We the last of a dying breed
Steady searching for my kind's like a dire need
Everyday I'm watching liars eat and leech
While I starve, sleep and listen to the friar teach
Peace, everyday I pray for it
Every blessing I receive I try and pay forward
But sometimes, the sun shines
More like a gun line, boss, better call one time
Running blind on this strange journey
I hope I'm still alive when they bring gurneys
In this world where friends are more attorney then Bert or Ernie
It hurts me deep, peep, I'm steady learning
That when it's money, bet it's all good
Most Robin Hoods ain't got a merry man in Sherwood
Find a good heart, no Google search could
Brothers was killing brothers in Eden where we first stood

Last of a dying breed, I'm curious
All my people on lock down, Lord, mysterious
Say
Last of a dying breed, everybody here better stop now
Nothing's gonna slow that clock down, no, I'm furious

Should the good stroll off the Atlas, forsaking the hapless
Let the soldiers of the soulless prevail in the madness
Shit's real in the field when it's minimal rations
And all feel the hunger from the sum of the actions
Running thick as thieves, robbing through blurred lines
Levels of good and evil, graded on curved lines
The pinnacle's a pentacle, bewitching the cynical
Left stranded on the planet where the wicked survive
Say no to truth, while addicted to lies
Gentrifying, remove the hood like it was just a disguise
Throw the blank on, a blanket party, like it's just a surprise
The menace of what lives in a secular thrive
Penance on what gives and is eaten alive
Apocalypse approaches in the form of divide
Too many bees in the trap, bear hands in the hive
Reacting to what's sweet with the sting out of mind

Last of a dying breed, I'm curious
All my people on lock down, Lord, mysterious
Say
Last of a dying breed, everybody here better stop now
Nothing's gonna slow that clock down, no, I'm furious",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-dying-breed-lyrics
Die For You,Strange Journey Volume One,2009.0,"What'll you do if there comes a day when I lose my way?
What will you do?
Oh I would stand by you (Word?)
Pray for you (Oh yeah?)
If it would help I’d even die for you

I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
Over against my own will, surrounded by illusions
Fighting to stay positive, however losing
Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
The human heart does more than just pump blood
It pumps love, at least I know that mine did once
But a large piece of it was undone
And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
But be certain of your faith and you’ll acquire the ability
To expose witches and burn them at the stake
I’m looking for love, I’m done searching for a date
I've been alone for years, but it’s worth it if you wait
Personally, late’s better than never at all
So when I brush myself off, whenever I fall, tell me
What'll you do..


Oh yeah? That’s what the last one said
Unfortunately I was mad misled
I ran on E til no more gas was left
The most I got from her was ass and bread
But trust was lost like Kanye’s fashion sense
Accidents happen when you live with the weak
But it’s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
That’s enough reason to get into beef
Throw all your spouse’s shit on the street, quit & retreat
But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
So please for my sake, stay by me, this earth is cold
And I’m freezing like I’ve been lying in dirt and snow
I’ve searched the globe for a person who knows
The true meaning of love, you could be the one
If you mean what you say we could link up
And use what we learned from our exes in the past
But wait cause I got another question to ask and that’s…


Sounds good and if you mean it, I’ll hook up with you this evening
Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
The touch of a king when you’re my queen
And trust is the the key in every relationship
But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
But looks can be deceiving
Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
So don’t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
That’s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
But the first line of this song already explained
That my arteries were drained, now all of me is tame
So stay beside me cause I don’t wanna be estranged
Two warm bodies on a page
As soon as time found them they were saved
And still lay there to this day
But if this should ever change
And if I ever lose my way
Just stay and I’mma do the same",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-die-for-you-lyrics
South California,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"""How could she look at me and say, 'I'm going'?
How could she break my heart without even knowing?
She said she was going home to South California""

She had a Cali beach body bearin' skin I love
Even though Natti country as a bear-skin rug
Southern charm got her arm interlocked with mine
Kentucky-fied chicks talking greasy all the time
""She think she too good, she think she dope""
Bitch if she thought them things she’d be right bout both
She came to UK screaming ""CATS!"" all day
Bled blue since she used to watch Tayshaun play
Loved the color in the trees when the leaves would fall
In the south getting high like cholesterol
My kinfolk would tease her best of all
About her west coast shakes made of vegetables
Talking hella proper like reading a teleprompter
Long ass legs looking fly as a helicopter
But on final descent 
bad news was sent
Not a Hollywood divorce but a bluegrass split and she went

""She said she was going home to South California
That's where she came from""

Ayo, I met her on the corner of Abbot Kinney and Venice
She said her life was a movie and finding me was the premise
Taught about love, she was willingly my apprentice
Sex like a drug, she played the role of a chemist
Supplying me with a feeling I never thought I could fathom
Cupid shot me right in the chest with his golden handgun point blank
Joint full of dank in my left palm
Riding in my ladyfriend's car coming down Crenshaw
Cruisin' through the city bumping Biggie doing 60 in a residential
You got me feeling like heaven sent you
So forget the rumors and what all your jealous friends do
Always put my lady first I'm so presidential
She's picture perfect with a small frame
But she had to fly back south when the fall came
I got the feeling that she might'a had another
She'll be gone till June, but she's mine for the summer because.

Embers,Oneirology,2011.0,"Imagine the burning embers
They glow below and above
Your sins you won’t remember
And all you’ll find there is love

I’m cloaked in smoke but feel no flames
Folks float around me but I see no wings
No halos or hounds, pitchforks or gates
Or omnipotent voice that picks course or fate
To the life of indecision build a dreamscape prison
Where light isn’t manufactured but captured inside a prism
In a state between asleep and awake
Feels closest to hypnosis where the infinite wait
Then the fog dissipates revealing crimson fields
Crept on by a fawn with flaming heels
Eyes red as stop signs and a mane of quills
As it gaze past hills of diamond trees
I see a silhouette rest upon golden knees
For the body of a goddess and a face of dreams
A half-naked Meagan Good in a pagan hood
Kiss me on the cheek, we didn’t speak but I understood
It wasn’t Heaven that I was seeking but a haven I sought
A canvas of the mind painted with my thoughts


Everything ain’t what it seems
I wake up to find I’m inside of a dream inside of a dream
See buried deep beside the seams of my screams
Of beings and otherworldly things rarely seen
Might be psychosis or maybe I chose this
The night approaches every time the eye closes
I see a burning bush, feel like I’m Moses
Burn so much kush I feel like amosis
All my images are morgues and wounds
And every fork in the road moves through Freud and Jung
In the darkness no orchard blooms
A state so dark, sparks from the torch is consumed
It’s like I live in a fortress of doom
In the forest where the blood pores were forced from my wounds
My body aches from this lobotomy, a part of me shakes
Open my eyes, I’m awake, awake

Ashes are burning brightly
The smoke can be seen from afar
So now you’re seeing how far
Ashes are burning the way",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-embers-lyrics

Predormitum (Prologue),Oneirology,2011.0,"I had a funny dream the other night
I was floating in a cloud

I am floating happy not knowing nautical course
Tie a wristwatch in slipknots and dock at my porch
Time is of no essence, the presence becomes presents
Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance
Current currencies worthless, fodder for feeding purses
With iron clad words I solder together verses
I’m trippin like I’m eatin’ the fungi
Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye

Listen
There's no light, just never ending night
And the weather's like a hurricane when land is in its sight
The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
And I'm trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
From the motions of the sea, to the color of the dark
This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
I wonder as I wander through my heart

Cus it starts a dream defferred
A clipped wing on a white dove
Seems absurd, a smudge on a white glove
Not seen nor heard like screams from the night's lungs
Cling to words so much that you won't budge
Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
Thats what the night does
It hits your mind with the right stuff
To keep you blind with a slight buzz

The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
We scuffle through it's pieces, strugglin for peace it's
Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
The image in my mirror’s gettin harder to relate
I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
But I couldn't be farther from my faith, or my face
Through this waste of my mind, may I find direction
I'm a waste of my time if I don't find it's lessons

So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
As the world twirls on the tip of our index
Staring into space one’s vision is endless

But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is

So just close pupils and be pupils and listen

The headset’s your desk the test is what’s missin

Murder (Act II),Oneirology,2011.0,"What if I told you that the battle was on?
Would that rattle ya bones? or would you be down to kill in the name of the throne
Drop bombs on innocent people or innocent homes
With automatic weapons or military drones
While me and my friends play croquet
And make bets on which country liable to fold next
Under the pressure of my fingertips
Any day or any time
They just cattle
We don’t need they kind any how
Talking population control
Gotta make room for the young, so it’s out with the old
I got tanks that need usin’, I’m lettin’ em go
For the low and some c-4 charges that’s ready to blow
I got the ticket on sativa ‘cause my patnah the supplier
And all my homeys down to invest in my empire
Sink the economy with no natural evidence
They complain, but that’s a part of being president
If I could get away with murder
I’d take my gun and I’d commit it X 2

I could use worship as a warship, bible and sword
Turn men and women to minions over Heaven’s rewards
Promise Islamic bombers Heavens harem of whores
For taking out a couple of floors
The holiest wars bring profits/prophets and I don’t mean Moses
Unless he’s on the screen when the NASDAQ opens
Horatio Caine won’t be able to blame me
For the third party bodies that his followers slain
Ashes and burnt remains all left in the name

Whoever you praise, I just made it a game
Called winners and sinners, but they one and the same
You can play along with us at home
We livin’ in Rome, destined to fall
Didn’t you hear? I ain’t worried about the views of the public and peers
Shit, Hitler was once Time mags' Man of the Year
I’ma get it with hope while I’m peddlin’ fear
I’m a wolf in a wool cap with robes to match
Leadin’ the flock right down the hatch
I’m the fox in the hen house, the Devil You Know
In a black Cadillac, wrist glistenin gold
On my way to eat steaks with TD Jakes

Aces and acres of haters growing out the same root
That hit you quicker than poverty in two major arteries
Havin you movin and softshoe-in like who made you property

Black face and sambos, tied for last place
Let facts state, we like Wildcats in a rat race
At that rate, the state stay ahead of tomorrow
Standing out like mount Kilimanjaro

So through this Bluegrass follow sorrow
Blacker then the ghetto you fear
You disappear like the future of the ghetto you near
Where index fingers bring the heavy metal you hear
Block stars loading guns as fiends battle for crumbs

Come travel through slums, try politickin with pushas
Made block decisions, while mothafuckas overlooked us
Under the radar like helicopters on the sly
Crept in with hoods on, KKKY

KKKY, more then what you thank it is
Ain't just tobacco, some bourbon and where horse racin live
This is for my Mark Makers, I keep my flask tipped
Live where the grass crip, steppin in my blood

Don't try to play Mike Vick and stick a dog in this fight
Ya art of loud bark don't veto your mosquitoish bite
The mc's too dark, the producer too white
Fam the lyrics too loose, the beats is to tight

We parry blows, we bury foes through stereos
Keep an aerial view over scenarios
Some niggas, that move spirts like a liquor store
AA, after 12 steps you back to get some more

Makers of Woodford Reserve that curve ya nerves
We country, coming with fists while you armed with words
Field nigga brand hands that'll slap you to sleep
From the land of hard liquor and tobacco that's cheap
 We rose like Lazarus, a miraculous feat
Put soul in it gave what's left back to the streets

Can't wade in that water because of rogue scuds

No need to find self

Don’t mean to sound cold, got my soul singing baritone
Feelin' down low
To think
Of those in this winter with no mink, or folk
Weathering this desert with no drink to cope
Some chain smoke with no link or hope
Just dope, tree and a rope

You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
The fastest can’t run from who they are
I’d run from self but no man can run that far

Turn the page, eventually I hit a certain age
Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you’re afraid
Success can often be a perfect cage
Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
A prisoner, trapped in the regret
Cuz the ego can’t keep up if they happen to reject it
Sometimes you want so bad to be respected
Goin’ after it ‘til you’ve left your happiness neglected
I’ve seen the weakness in grown men
Playing games with their pain, they cheat but they don’t win
Seen ‘em feed the needle deep into their own skin
Tryna find a fleeting bit of peace in that moment
More success to fix what’s left
Take an even bigger risk like after this I’ll rest
Til he painted with the razor on his wrist a red
The color of lips, pucker up it’s the kiss of death

I’m Bustin’ Loose, no Wilder, just a Pryor
And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
Meet a fan, kick it witcha, take a picture
Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister
It’s been real
Realer than steel I’da grabbed before I picked up a pen and a pad
Shit, it’s been chill
Chiller than the look in the eye of a junkie when he’s looking to buy looking to fly
Pyrex on the good eye of a broke stove
Pyramid of cans, tin foil with poke holes
Soft white girl break your nose and gets harder

Hangin hives on jungle gyms, lettin the bees out

Smack him with the bat, lay his ass out flat

Jugga Bully wasn't at all popular
Until that day I beat down the hall monitor
I used to use small binoculars
To look at girls through this hole in the wall
That led directly to the stalls where the broads lockers were
And they were usually all topless or leanin over to tie their shoes
That's when I bust through, and make my move to grab at least 5 boobs
And this ain't high school, this is kindergarten
Juggs was into arson, burned the media center into carbons
I guess I had mental problems, but then again
I think my problems started when the school nurse put me on Ritalin
(Blame her!) Y'all put sugar in gas tanks
I put boogers on the substitute's glass and he drank
I had pics of a hooker with the principal, gettin his ass spanked
I guess I had a passion for pranks
I wasn't scared of the teachers (nah)
Juggs was gettin head under the bleachers
Durin the Pledge of Allegiance, that's what I'm bout

Hey! Cuttin in the lunch line, what you thinkin dawg?
I'll stab you dead in yo' eye with a Lincoln Log
Oh you think I'm soft because I rock Izod?
Pull out the sawed off ' ""Oh my God!"" {*chkchk-BOOM*}
Even though I never been hauled off to juvenile detention
I done things too vile to mention
I was too demented; remember when Baby Jessica fell in the well?
I threw her in it!!
I always been a sick kid
Took hella Valiums and all type of doctor's prescriptions
And when the Den Leader gave me stress
I smacked him in the grill with my Merit Badge vest
Nevertheless, classmates learned never to test
Unless they want a spitball stuck to they neck
Oh you think it's funny? I'll beat you down
Screamin out my buddy, my buddy, my buddy!

Life's sweet in a suite plenty bees to fly
Let the truth peel back and deceit recline
Everybody just tryna find peace of mind
Love riding shotgun with a piece of mine
In a lust disguise or just reverse the sides
It ain't the race or the size of the purse that drives
Maybe behind eyes where beautiful lies
When that bond becomes bondage with similar ties
Is this feeling affliction or addiction
Is this even a feeling or a condition
Can it be rolled or packed In bowl
Hidden in tracks or packed in ya nose
Pure fiction, dip a tip in
Get a taste and feel ya face so you know if it's real
Bliss is an abyss you meet with a clenched fist
So tense you feel ya body is steel
A touch of a sugar rush can catch any one of us
Bring you to climax and leave you with wanderlust
Feeling euphoria trapped in euphoria
But that's just her dance name
Her real name is “nonofya”
Last name “beesness”
Plus that was like way back
So far way back so that's black history
If sobers the new sour it's bitter a few hours

On I-85 North, going nowhere
Would hit the 400, but I ain't got money for the toll there
Traffic backed up ahead of me, I see the road flares
School bus on my right, kids laughin' with brown and gold hair
Replaying conversations in my head by my ex-wife
From the house work that I did, to the kids, even our sex life
She said I was crazy so I threatened to prove her dead-right
So she got court orders, restraining me, put on the red lights
Frustrated, thinking how the fuck could I clean it up
Traffic stopped, about 1000 degrees in my truck
Loosened my tie, wiped the sweat out of my eyes, mixed with tears
Mind thick with fears, I've lost everything that I done built for years
Bright yellow school bus fucking up my limbo
Kids bitchin', cussin', flickin' boogers upon my window
Start rolling it down for some air and the handle breaks
Kick my door open, dive out, feeling some escape
""We said vows and shit, that shits' for life right?!
Yeah, that shit's until death, death...
That shit can be mended
But that bitch don't be listening to me!
She'll prolly throw a fucking fit and shit!
I'mma go there that bitch is gonna listen to me
She'll see I'mma fix this shit, FUCK THAT!""
: ""Move your fucking car, maaaaan!!""
Motherfucker is my one car really haulting movement
I got some powerful shit in my trunk want me to use it?
I grabbed that shit, cocked it now talk like you're silly!
If you needed some release would I fuck with you, Billy?
""Look away lady, before I swiss cheese your Mazda""
Am I crazy for wanting my babies to have a father?
Gonna show my bitch of a wife she better work a little harder
Stop them kids from screaming, it's pushing me even farther!
It's my daughter's birthday, Billy, you like this gift?
Your name's not Billy? Really? Then why do you react to it?
If you're an actor, am I your fuckin' audience?
Kids, look how many different directions his body went
It's okay, I'm not crazy, I got kids your age
Don't be afraid, I said don't be afraid! Behave!
Now y'all be cool now, I'm leaving now, it's beyond hot
'Bout to visit my wife after hitting the pawn shop for more Glocks
I got some shit to fix (sinister chuckle) I got some shit to fix

Today's about to be one of the biggest days of my life
Cause I'm about to ask the women I love if she'll be my wife
I just know that she will, for this women, I'll KILL
I used to clean dishes at Micky D's, now I'm on grill
So I've been able to save up enough money for this necklace
Along with this ring for when I pop the big question
But my manager's been stressin' the way I been dressin'
Tellin' me I need new shoes but I can't afford to get them!
He's all about perfection and does shit that I hate!
Today he wrote me up and I was only five minutes late!
And then he threatened to take me off grill and make me scrub plates
And the toilet where people shit out all the food they just ate!
AW FUCK! I'm starting to hear my screws bust
Screw it, I'll do it, He gives me Windex and a toothbrush
Now I'm scrubbin the toilet like, FUCK MY BOSS and HE STINKS!
I'm asking my girl to marry me, fuck what everyone thinks
Let me look at the ring now to calm me down like my shrink
NOOOOOO! I JUST DROP IT AND NOW IT'S LOST IN THE SINK
And today on my lunchbreak my girl's supposed to come through
I wanna ask her but without the ring what'll I do?

SOS: Wassup baby. Listen I wanna tell you something
GIRL: ""Yeah?""
SOS: Well, we've been together for a long time and...
GIRL: ""Uh huh...""
SOS: ...I love you more than anything in this world... Will you marry me?
GIRL: ""So where's the ring?""
SOS: I... I had one but... I dropped it in the sink...
My... my manager... he... he made me get off the grill and clean the toilets
And...(sob)
GIRL: Yeah... WHATEVER! I'm seeing somebody else anyway, loser!""
: Grrrrrrrrrrr......
FUCK YOU FOR REAL! SNUFF TO YA GRILL! SMACK TO YA FACE!
FOOT TO YOUR CROTCH! Look at the cops...
THANKS FOR THE GAT! RAT-A-TAT-TAT! CRIME IN THE ACT!
BITCH, DO YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT???
SICK cause my mind just snapped pretty hard!
Fatality... RIP YOUR TITTY OFF!
Pull out the gun that I got from the cop
And make her face look like Barbecue sauce
Bite off her nipple like it's on the menu
And spit it out the drive through window inside a Pinto and leave the driver
Crippled
When I fire my pistol like it's a missile. (BLAOW!)
Start to hear sirens whistle I've lost my mind, it's official!
Grab my manager's pencil and stick it in his eye tissue
For having a time issue, go to the bathroom and try to kick through
The sink. I made a mess and shot cops. Let off a couple of pop pops
ON THE CLOCK let me go before the alarm stops
I'mma take this damn ring to the pawn shop
To get my FUCKIN money back... (cries) fuckin bitch!

Ignition contact in my little compact
Nissan piece of shit and I need to quit
Funneling Night Train pummels my right brain
Feel the pain of a hangover, I smell the faint odor of piss
I need to lower my risk
Hittin my liver with this liquid deliverance
I'm fuckin laughin and stuck in traffic
As my 8-track tape deck pumps some wack shit
It's drastic
I walked in on my friend with his hand caught in my wife's panty elastic
While she was wearin em!
Started tearin em a new asshole verbally
I don't think I hurt em
Twisted off the MD and Bourbon
Got the straight vodka in my coffee thermos
Put on my game face and walk in the door
Of my job at the strip mall discount department store

Boss: Dan-O! Happy Birthday
Kno: Thanks!
Boss: Oh, before I forget uh, we're gonna have to let you go Dan-O
Kno: What?!
Boss: Yeahh, we've been monitoring incoming packages for a while now, we noticed you have a fetish for naked pictures of Janet Reno and Will Smith CD's. Yeahh
Kno: (crying)
Boss: Hey, uh...what's the machine gun in the paper bag for?
No, Mr. Johnson! YOUR ASS IS FIRED!
Heres your pink slip get hit with six clips
Salespeople out front, I ain't forget y'all
Split y'all, and everybody in this strip mall
Walk in the Dollar Store and just let off
Now even the managers body is 50% off!
Hit up Toys R Us and bust my shit
(ratttatat) TRICK LUH DA KIDS!!
Music store massacre, cus theyre trying to tell me
21.99 for a Nelly CD?!
Verizon fucked up my service so they ain't out of the woods
Can you hear me now? BIATCH!(gunshot) GOOD!!!
Shop owners, cashiers, even the patrons
This is punishment for gettin caught in my matrix
The chance for survival is miniscule
I see two dudes walking towards the pawn shop they bout to get it too",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-falling-down-lyrics
Yellow Lines,Dirty Acres,2007.0,"It feels alright
So just lay back into the night
But don't lose sight
Make sure you watch those Yellow Lines

I'm DUI in her eyes, but fuck tapping the brakes
Let's shorten up the time fantasy take
Stroke her ego slow til' her vanity quake
Satin hair, silk skin, wet panties and lace, the
Fabric of love, the thrill of the chase
Blunted, lovin the highway, spinnin in place
My hands are Sex Pistols, strapped to her waist
Strange fruitin lip gloss, try and savor the taste
We can both play games, exchange fake names
Paint pictures of lust using both our frames
Remain unaware of the spell you under
Prisoner of love when given my cell number
High off love, lust in your joints
Kiss and tellin the tale of our sex exploits
Yo relationship sank out to sea
Now you floating on driftwood behind fucking with me

It feels alright
So just lay back into the night
But don't lose sight
Make sure you watch those Yellow Lines

I put a spell on them hoes
I have 'em in the corner on Patron at the shows
I can tell when they ain't from around here
The spell start working when my finger say 'come here'
I'm not a pimp, I'm not a trick
But please believe me I can have any bitch
They call me short, dark and handsome
Kidnap your girl, send your man a little ransom
(Hey) Hey! I'm making major moves, won't you holla back
Hoes twisting my hair with some o' that beeswax
At the club she say she don't dance
But she bouncing on that hot thang in my pants
Ya got money, take her out tonight to eat
She coming over after you finish with the Applebee's
Bobby said slow down, I say go slow
I'm the reason she don't fuck witchu no more
I'm the reason for her being on the pill
I'm the reason Sir Charles had to chill
To get her freaky don't need a bottle of gin
And we be fucking like the world 'bout to end
Ey, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes
Yeah, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes
Hey, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes
I just, I put a spell on them hoes
Forgive me Lord, but I'm hell on them hoes, hell on them hoes

She used to call me late at night
Didn't take long to see that we were a-alikes
On the same page, just couldn't get it right
Macintosh of my eye, let me take a mega bite
I cordially invite you to come take a ride in my thoughts
Switch memory lanes while we dreamin, wanderin
And in return I'll strip my inhibitions
And go skinny dipping in your stream of consciousness
She said it sounds tempting
And I don't want to catch feelings
But this urge is calling me bad
I said well sugar, if you're worried 'bout catching feelings
Chances are you already have
And there's no need to deny ourselves
I mean, lie to each other and deprive ourselves
Denial's not a game I'm prepared to play
So I express things most niggas scared to say
Put a spell on 'em, Forgive me Lord but I'm hell on 'em
Baby we grown folk, So let me longstroke
And send em back to they man with my smell on 'em
Let me be quiet before I tell on 'em

It feels alright
So just lay back into the night
But don't lose sight

Mindstate,Will Rap for Food (Deluxe Edition),2001.0,"(Scratched) Knowledge be the key
To unlock your brain and set your mindstate free

What? All eyes. Pay attention

Non-familiarity makes you scared to see
The beauty in front of your eyes
You're thinkin' narrowly
Everything isn't a predictable occurrence
If you've experienced everything except a purpose
Then you've missed everything that was meant to be caught
Life sessions aren't lessons that can be simply taught
You gotta feel the matter
Build the data
You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter
In the field, we choose to scatter like mice
Instead of coming together and keeping it tight
It's hard to be alone, deep in the night
I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
But so many times I fall in between the lines
Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight
You might as well freebase on pipes
I've fallen down but I got up friend
Fell twice
Three times
Got up again and again
And again, it's nobodies but my fault it didn't end
You only don't win when you give in
The days we live in
Send shit that'll break the strongest
I put on my body armor and remain the calmest
Being peaceful at heart helps me see through the dark
Like dogs barkin' it's hard for evil people to start bullshit
With a literally cool kid whose only form of battlin' is through music
If you hold yourself tight you can't lose it
Life or death, it's up to you who you cruise with
Exercise knowledge to increase your wealth
If you know yourself you'll be shown your wealth (x3)

Sometimes I ask myself a question
Is my lack of inner reflection
Some type of indication of what state my life is in?
They keep piping in elevator music
Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
When I reflect back and recollect that
I was born into the state of walking slumber
Taught numbers, realize I'm dirt poor
It hurts more now that I'm older
Showered in water much colder than this
Holdin' my lips and close thee abyss
With the speech and the phoniest kiss
Rendered lifeless
Talk about an identity crisis
My third eye remains sightless
When the night hits
Can't help but lie awake
Contemplate fights with vice grips
Depressions and lessons in starvation
It's hard to be patient
Sittin' perfectly still, listen to your own heart racin'
Assume the description of my life and it's reality
Is on the warm side of fatality
It's not fair the way you challenge me
Or the silent way my talents be
Hidden inside these translations
Emancipation as I try to dab the slate clean
Futile attempts to make my fate glean
Hate seems all inclusive
It makes me want to fall reclusive
And rip the tallest loose-leaf
With a makeshift facelift
For my mental state
Huh check it out",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-mindstate-lyrics
Things I Dream,Dirty Acres,2007.0,"I had a dream and it was so strange, so strange 

Ah, deep perspiration, heartless and impatient
My angel's just a devil from shoulder to shoulder pacin'
Fillin' my gaze with hate, eyes cold as Alaskan basements
Aimed at records for targets 
while labels look like the Masons
I hang around outside of they buildin' amongst the vagrants
Dangerous, loaded stainless, maturity plus minority
Cool as cues, but cocked back is the priority
One in the flesh, lights, cops just stop where they stand
As I proceed to beat the publishing up outta this man
Tellin' him ""Get the fuck up!"" They yellin ""How could he stand?""
I don't expect him to, bitch, I counted close to the land
Louisville slugger cover every inch of his noggin'
Bobbin' with every strike, askin' ""What heaven like?""
The reverend might win a visit, that is if his spirit is near it
But if you yield towards hell you'd hear it more vivid
But I'm under slumber, ya get it?
To see it I'd have to let you all...

See the things I dream 

Yeah, once upon a time I seen it clearer than the bluest day
Got off in some crime seen that line turn blueish-grey
Humorin' themselves about murder, pussy and politics
Word around the world is money and I want all of it
World crooked like St. Ide's eyes acknowledge this
Just ask them Virginia Tech college kids
While you wait for apologies, I'm low like a fox
Get between me and your rocks, I'll put your ass in the box
I feel the odds favor robbin' a world without God
Money's the language, in humanity you need Visa cards
I need your cash and your car before I smash your facade
Or watch this classic toy make you collapse to the side, under the yard boy
Since a child these thoughts lurkin' in my shadows
Heard 'em placin' wages on how will I face my battles
Accelerate to add dope feel but never faulted
I'm standin' upon rock that'll make powder out Gibraltar


Fumblin' with sweat on my fingers, somethin' impetuous lingers
Become infected with feelings so I'm electing this evil
To end my life without reason cause I'm indicted for treason
Closin' my eyes and I'm leakin', draggin' the knife till I'm bleedin'
Cause it's the life that I'm seekin', 
feels only right that I'm meetin'
With Jesus seeking redemption but he don't want my repentance
For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin' my blessings
Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
Parents repeatedly sentenced, heroin needles on dressers
They use to feed their infection, I can't repeat indescretions
So I pause for reflection, long for honest affection
And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
If you knew where my head is when I'm doing these records
You'd never listen to my music again, I can't let you.....

See the things I dream 

I will know how things can be....

Shattered Dreams,Oneirology,2011.0,"Poor me, pour me a shot of patron
Cigarillo or bordello I just gotta be blown
In a silicone zone where titties are grown
And sessions in the recession where fifties are thrown
Rose petals, pedaled within cities of stone
Reefer and liquor dance, my chemical romance
My pitiful cold hands
That ache to be warm
Like a tux with gold cuffs that waits to be worn
Nowadays
Loves in the haze of a flashback
Those that invest deeply need be gettin’ they cash back
Being in lust with love, feels so dreamy
Till it’s shattered in beautiful pieces scattered beneath me
I still chase it, you gotta believe me
I just don’t think it’s as instant as an instance on tv
We try to close the distance but persistence ain’t easy
There’s a ribbon in the sky if you listen to Stevie
Problem is, my arms can’t reach that far
Or stretch that high, is it best I fly
With the wings of a goose, mixed with red bull
And a night cap slapped on to keep my head cool
Awaken in a state of confusion
Dressing quickly to get back to my city
Fuckin’ delusion
Where I live
Where I stay
Where I sleep
Where I lay

I’ve seen all the things that pass me by
Oh why can’t it be real?
I cling to my dreams as I grab the sky
Oh why can’t it be real?",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-shattered-dreams-lyrics
Hot,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"What is the Question?

Now when I see the man in the mirror
I see an animal clearer
The teeth look sharp, and and ain’t a man that’s much realer
I do somersaults and flips with nunchucks like a ninja turtle
I’m very bold, I’ll sell crack on an infomercial
I tell you what, if I don’t get the props I deserve
Imma leave you bleeding by the curb, and that’s my momma’s word
Bank account, commas absurd
Cause I sell specialty rap music, and sell out concerts
My favorite spot in the sporting goods, is the hunting section
They got slingshots and crossbows, and other types of weapons
Camouflage vests, and fully stocked with the lead
Next aisle over I can go fishing instead
And to the fake ones, your salaries low
Flow cornier than VH1 romance reality shows
Y’all know, I used the body wash to clean my shotty off
Cause its been catching back splatter from hacking through body parts

A southern rebel that’ll leave your vital levels flat
You won’t be hot until you die and give the devil dap
You about as stupid as that pot that called the kettle black
I be conscious rapping but now even Gepetto’s strapped
Here to take the ghetto back, hush the whack stanzas
Taking it back to when rapping was talk ‘tween Black panthers
I’m Huey, Newton or Freeman, all of the above
You ain’t even Huey Lewis, ain’t got no power or love
And what’s sadder, you won’t touch rungs on Jake’s ladder
Universally unworthy of time, space, or matter
You hot as in anger, not as in magma
Deac is Death Valley, You are A-laska
I mastered the range, you mastered the lame
And the day that you’re the flame, I’m the rain
Strange

Big booty Twitter vixen, this is something tight 
Even make your main chick say she quite 
Some dumb reason say her prison be 
Fell her gaze blazing at you – laser beam 
Face is the bomb: body’s detonator 
We talkin’ black folk filled elevator 
Think its cool now? Fool later see us 
Every time you leave think you out being 
Stick to her, forgettin’ she’s gonna tell you hell is 
And she hope you go in summer when its even more 
Eyes even glowing terminator red 
Shit would be a past red dot beam 
Shoulder so cold make an igloo seem 
Pushing all the buttons make the topic seem 
This gold made cup make us sip so 

All these girls man they just want to sweat some starve
But I don’t get gassed up like an electric car
And I don’t need a ski mask to rob these bitches of they innocence
I'm at the strip club, seducing seven Russian immigrants
Single moms is so DTF
I hit it, quit it, then report the bitch to DCF
I’m so Bobby Brown, not the new edition days
Never stop my ignorant ways
Not as long as pimpin’ pays Ap's 

In the strip club, all the dancers look 
Damn all the money stickin to ‘em, cause she 
Back sweat make em look

The Format,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"The Format

If we gonna start from scratch, you start with wax
If there's no dish, then there's no rap
Records, albums, vinyl, the facts
Give us a stack of records and we'll give you 12 tracks
The agreement turned cement
40 years ago
Hip Hop, the vinyl frontier
The embryo
Two turntables a mic and a cold stereo, DJ, one MC, the imperial
Many many put their muse to it
Sent bop, sent rock, sent blues through it
From classical to jazz we can who’s who it
Or blow the dust off and groove to it
Lets ride
B-side on direct drive
You know that crackle give the best high
Give me a needle, a cartridge, a partridge, some tree, 45s and a 33, let it be

A new format hit the scene like way back
It was smaller and more convenient than 8-track
You could pop it in your car on a long drive
Play the album or fast-forward to song five
If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
Memorex, Ampex down to TDK
Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
When they was on the air, I was on the pause-button
I had the best taste but I ain't trying to cause nothing
Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws
Cats used to battle, this shit used to cause wars
We would trade tapes, that was the best it could be
Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
Having the best tapes, was like a status symbol
The yellow tape, 
purple tape
 to the baddest demo
Battles travel from the Bronx to Baltimore
They would stand by the speaker to record them all
Them same tapes that was labeled with a thick marker
Made the neighbourhood rappers want to spit sharper
If my tape pop trust, I was ready man
A razor blade, scotch tape and a steady hand
I call it surgery
My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life
Man that's word to me

If you want it, I got it
That which makes you move
""It's... the format baby""
If you want it, I got it
That which makes you cool
""It's... the format baby""

My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle
Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the beat
Stab the repeat button and keep running
And that's something you can't get from tape dubbing
Skip the skips with a flick of the wrist
More time to check what's sick on the list
The fickle dismissed this little digital disk
But try and play vinyl in the whip, it'll skip
And it's '96, I'm trying to get laid now
Chose the format with binary laid down
1s and 0s, and 0s and 1s, 
flood the BOSE with flows and drums
Blunts get blown in my homie's truck
We 
sitting on chrome
, 
little bone thugs
We got wheels, we ain't trying to walk man
CD's nuts, there's dust on my walkman

Follow me entering this digital odyssey
Holy matrimony but harder to see
Everywhere but non-existant
, 
what a conundrum
Upgraded but they say we forgot where we come from
The past feels even further with every second
Off the record
, 
the coming and going of Kbps
In the day of the instant message
The message
 is misdirected and the receiver seems to be disconnected
But don't complain, love game
Even after the flood came and left our neighbors over-saturated
With no computer love, just computer bugs
Hate the virus and not the hacker, that's what a loser does
Meanwhile, the kids are playing shoot em' ups
Trying to be the 2.0 version of Super Thug
Press reset, any era you wish to visit is next
Hold on as we eject",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-the-format-lyrics
Red Bird,Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"A red bird sings the song
In love no mourning

What do wings bring? New heights to reach
To soaring somewhere foreign borders too tight to breach
Where color isn’t covered in a few types of bleach
We learning without concern in how it too whites ya speech
Preach nest between earth and most high
Over streets tar that severs feathers from sky
Like star crossed lovers that never said a goodbye
But hello to a haven that tethers cheddar to pride
Glide, ride air Jordan gave you to breathe
The only way the ground allows you to leave
Please, received a message through a cloud of trees
Praying for heaven is hell on the knees
Catch a breeze and glide further than the eyes can see
Or stay attached to the turf as the mind concedes
And never soar, so close to Poe every Raven is evermore
Or simply weather the storms in search of a perfect shore

A red bird sings the song
In love no mourning

She sleeps through the night
Mother wondering how to change life
Ain’t none of the streets paved in gold
Just rusted tracks and dusty roads
The broken chains we don’t discuss
She’s praying for the miraculous
Her baby bird gotta fly in this world
Of hungry hunters, guns pointed to the sky
Hold now, let us slow down this little life
Created by the passions of pain, product of plight
A daily fight waiting for light this patient student
Bloodline never saw fit for jurisprudence
Baby Rose already knows she must spring
Through summer autumn and winter spring beyond dreams
Born sinner, born winner, same thing
But no rights for the children of chain
This changed queen; put it all in her princess
All of the knowledge her little brain could ingest
Told her she could hold globe in eye sight
If she spread wings and soared flew to high heights
She could be light, see the stark difference
Never awake to even see the dark’s ignorance
And only time knows if she prevails
Cause some times not even a birds eye
Can see the devil’s details, no",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-red-bird-lyrics
In the City,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"In the city
It's always been that way

In my city is blacks and blocks
With avenues and street tops
Where people struggle to sleep, Ahk
There's trouble and beef, gold teeth, rocks
Get thrown at the higher power, but don't reach, pops
Ain't home, momma been long gone away
So the children run stray
Cannibalistic war play, it's animalistic where I stay
The devil wan' play
And, too many contestants
That's ever day
The level gon' stay where it's at, stay strapped
It's the mantra recital, it conquers the Bible
By any means, see survival
When friends turn to rivals it's liable
For these confrontations to be homicidal
A dog hollers back at the sirens
The pain is so blinding
Forgot we all diamonds


Ain't nothing uglier, ain't nothing prettier
Than corner stores, whores, drugs galore
Exploitations core, guns and gore
I abhor each metropolis between these shores
And then I see it, faith in humanity restored
An act so selfless that I break out in applause
Giving so elvish that it must be Santa Claus
In the city, dogs, foaming at the jaws
That's kept the voice of justice in its claws, get the gauze
Because it can silence the loudest man
Whether concrete, dirt, whether canal or sand
You can black top, but the back drop remains
With the same plots repeating like famed refrains
The stains stare at ya
Intensity of character
Gotta be Darwinistic,
Got a propensity to bury ya
Home of the merriest
Land of the nefarious
Tomorrow is the city that will carry us, prepare",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-in-the-city-lyrics
The Morning,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"Here I am standing naked
Your search for answers will end in agony
Here I am standing naked
(Me too)
One thing is certain that is my destiny

I give you everything, yo
Standing in front of you naked crying again and I feel like a tyrant
I told you once that I loved you more than music, I was lying
But I swear you’re the closest second
And I am the most depressive
But you really make me better
And I really tried to let ya
This angry love a lecture
Vulnerability measured
You calm me with your presence
When you leave me I get reckless so I’m retchin'
And hopefully I throw up all these Catch 22’s
How could you win when I’m losing me fool?
Sucks to be truth that we through but we not
Catch us in bed it’s so oooh! we three hot
Maximum pressure for you to see right through my heart
You so smart you can pick me apart
Playing the cards I was dealt as an only child with a single mom
I got Abandonment issues for days and if you make me mad I’m gone
So I’m wrong
Now come and make me right while my eyes are dancing
You see just how I’m standing
Plus, I’m a cancer

Here I am standing naked
Your search for answers will end in agony
Here I am standing naked

One thing is certain that is my destiny

Naked as in ass out, dusted without a cent
Sex was twerkin for us and love spray was the scent
Made it rain while we singles, so emotionally spent
While building our house of love she came short on the rent
Fell head over heels, but couldn't feel the decent
The quicker the lights flicker the quicker the liquor hits
I was feral, out to get lucky
Her ass was heaven above me
And I was dying to go there
As soon the spirits touched me
Club lights can turn Misses Fugly to Misses Fucks Me
Cus I ain't talkin slick trick, don't confuse it with rusty
We left our love in that condom under your sister's truck seat
My bucket wasn't fly enough for you after our first meet
No need to be thirsty, no need to rehearse the
One night standing between you and your next me
Send me a nice picture, 
you still thick as a swap meet
But stop callin, breathing hard and whispering to me softly

Here I am standing naked
Your search for answers will end in agony
Here I am standing naked
(Me too)
One thing is certain that is my destiny

Yo, you prolly thinking that you know me, huh?
Know me so well that you can’t show me none
Well I showed you once, I know that
I told you only once, and what you do?
Take the full nine yards and scored a touch
But your hand went right through me you, thought you know me huh? Thought that you could see me when you woke up
But you woke up and you know what?
You prolly realize that you ain’t know much
The Cold Crush, the so what you told your homies for four months like
""We was so drunk""
Even though you learn to roll blunts
Now how you think I feel about that?
You used to feel my tracks, feel my raps
Tell me who you finna' know as real as that
It's true, you could see right through me but see me truly
Don’t think that you could screw me and tell your homegirls you used me
Like you didn’t know this nigga?
Know such and such and know so and so
But honestly?
I know how you really feel when you close the door
And I’m right there
Mr. Invisible in your right ear
It’s funny how one night can make you feel like it’s a year
But yea, for real",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-the-morning-lyrics

Get close and lose your soul, not gonna roll
So the G version of how this story's really told
Conquerin' Deacon is a silly goal
You’ll just become a new edition for “Faces of Death” videos
Splish splash in your own blood bath
Hole in your chest bigger than Bobby Brown's drug stash
Bigger than Louie Anderson's belly flop splash
Ass stretched wider than Jim Carrey’s mouth when he laughs
You might as well smoke a cigarette while you huff gas
Facin' me’s dumber than using fingernail clippers to cut grass
It's your choice, a dozen inch dick or a cocked 12
Cause playin' Cool J is the only time I'm rockin' L
That follows me like gunshots and hot shells
The last time I stopped rappin' coffin makers stock fell
Like sealed water holes, I got rap locked well
But your album's an iron raft, that shit will not sail

Watch out for twin questions when testin' me
I got so many punchlines you'd think I'm fightin' off referees
My speciality is in any type of world weaponry
So stop stressin'... or catch a hot lesson
You wouldn’t be fly with demonic possessions
I deliver lung shots that cause pneumonic depressions
The personification of bubonic infections
Like poisoned communion wine... people can't stomach my blessin's
In a battle session, I can blow out daylight
'Cause I'm like Shakespeare retired... I never playwrite
Never say shit twice, give ya one chance to hear it
My flow’s godly, touches your spirit so you’d better fear it
I collect souls and put 'em on clearance
Death's about to make an appearance due to your interference
So don’t surprise me and spark my defense reflex
'Cause I’m dope enough to suffocate your weak set with a Kleenex

I've been the truth since the cradle
While most of ya'll are so good at lyin' that I thought Simba raised you
Realize what I do to guys with lies
The only Mac you got came Super Sized with fries
Brand me, half animal, half cannibal
Make like Bruce Banner and throw a fuckin' van at you
The rap Hannibal, it takes my Silence to stop violence
Undermine my talents and leave you lyin' under violiets
My skills are like Bill Gates stock wealth
While half of y'all are fake fur, I mean not felt
I move at speeds that'll make a stop watch melt
Like auto fellatio, I'm only tryin' to top self
That's why half of these punks are scared to fight
They talk shit then flee like dog parasites
But I tear 'em right out the frame and set fire to the canvas
My depth is eternal, you’ll never understand this

Kings,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0,"Sire of sires, hiding behind squires
Similar to the emperors transparent attire
My guillotine swings and kings become silent
Let the blue blood run red to make violet
Let the brand new blood shed define violent
Fighting over the chair that's highest up in the air
The crown lives forever for never a lack of heir
How do lambs try to come to lay claim to a lion's share?
Everybody claim to have a kings just cause
Most wanna be the king just cus
Its become about as mindless as Midas minus the touch
Or a search and seizure of Ceasar's whole harem of sluts
Minus the nuts
Top of the mountain is much colder
Coming for the crown that's rapped round ya molar
Striking to bring fin to a shit eating grin
Most made men turn maiden
Few are brave till the end

Yes!
They playin checkers not chess
Check the way that I move on the set
King shit
On the throne leaning, leg across the armrest
Gold chains draped on my neck
King shit
I seen guys with dreams they had wings to fly
Get crushed like flies
King shit
The king dies, and darkness will touch the skies
But the sun shall rise
King shit

You can bow or watch your bough break
If the King swing leave you looking like some round steak
You just jest
Punch you in your clown face
Fire turned flesh
Turn you into pound cake
Smokin something loud as the crowd
When this castle forged steel came round to ya brow
And ya crown fell
I'm flyer than the ravens
Carrying the news on your new found enslavement
Any last words for your tombstone engravement
As laymen lay with yo ladies for payment
Cool enough to pull a coup in a coupe
That weak talk make me sick, somebody brew me some soup
Any regrets I'll let you brood in a noose
When I come home to roost get reduced (hol’ up!)
And fuck ya flag you need trust for truce
Death to anyone who cuts you loose
I'm talking that king shit

Yes!
They playin checkers not chess
Check the way that I move on the set
King shit
On the throne leaning, leg across the armrest
Gold chains draped on my neck

Get crushed like flies

Any Way the Wind Blows,Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"Hit the clock, hit the blinds, hit the pine (ay!)
Nothing but the hits, same shit different time (ay!)
Working out the kinks from the mind to the spine (ay!)
Shower water calling, fluoride on the other line
Phone jumping off the dresser in a silent suicide
Saved by the pile of designers on the side
She answers, her cousin with the body of a dancer
Say they gotta chance to be in a video
With little young so and so she swear he's about to blow
He signed and we dimes so cuzzo, we got to go
Grab hair clothes makeup, Garcia Vega's
And flock them other birds they gon' pay us like we Vegas
From rental to the highway to rental mansion driveway
Greeted by a oily jeweled rapper looking shiny
Eye like he used to bully Ice Cube on Fridays
Gripping on her waist and grinning in her face and
She just want her paper 'cause she feeling out of place and
Couple propositions got her feeling for her mace
And her cousin brought her burner, she ain't trying to catch a case
So they split, tires burnin' end of the street
With a grand some of none for you and none for me
Sometimes you gotta duck instead of flying in a V
Fuck flying in a V

Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows

She hit the clock, hit the blinds, hit the vape (ay!)
'Bout to hit the sky, get the wand, get the cape (ay!)
Working out the kinks, but it's love over hate
Usually shower calling but today she got a date
With a claw-foot tub and a back-rub
Then her phone starts singing as she bout to hit suds
Hits cancel but calls back
FaceTime to ignore the moment is a hate crime, she mainlines
It was her cousin talking 'bout some video
She jokes ""don't be out there acting like some city ho!""
And mo' of her mama's quotes through the smoke
Cut through the weeds and the overgrowth — a Rose
Said, cuz, you my blood right? (Right?)
You know that all that I say is love right? (Right)
You still wanna own a club right? (Right)
How ‘bout we talking business under sunlight? (Right!)

Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows
Any way the wind blows

Deep sigh, close the blinds, hit the snooze (ay!)
Nothing but the hits, same shit, different tune (ay!)
Glued to the gloom with a mind full of blues (ay!)
Shower water running while she cries in her room
Phone jumping off the dresser in a silent suicide
Saved by the pile of reminders on the side
She doesn’t pick it up, she’s numb to the cuts
And the wounds on her heart from a life in the rut
Texts come in from her cousin but that doesn’t interrupt
Dark thoughts on her mind, intertwined with the crushed
Blue pills by the dozens, the only time she doesn’t feel disgusting
Is when she’s home alone and she buzzing
Clutching to a moment and atoning for something
She lays by the phone, in a zone, feeling nothing
Uh, she reaches back to change the wax
As Cannonball plays the sax, she fades to black",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-any-way-the-wind-blows-lyrics

Hi-fivin' Zentradi, karate chopping martians
Sparks in the brain chamber, way braver
Came with more anger and danger than gangbangers
Megabeast in the space house
Some will never see the energy resonating, they steady hating
Lost on a foreign installation, spinning wayward on an asteroid
Aim at it, laugh and destroy, master noise
Feel the flame, kill the game, resilient frame of mind
Never contain the nano-tech disease, get sneezed out
Degrees outlined and defined what it be about, I see it now
Electro-convulsive therapy got 'em aware of the clarity
Being compromised in the air they breathe
Fear is weak, better to bully they way around
With chemtrails,
 phase one, ready to chow down

Stranger in their own skin, danger from they own kin, something controlling them
Covert undercover, emotional rollercoaster, make 'em hurt one another
Stranger than fiction, 
anger predicts the probability of friction
Where does it lead to, the information vehicle, what does it feed to you?

Yeah, well, we riding on beams of light, quite blinding
Shining like diamonds worn by Orion
Holodeck dining, glitches that sneak swine in
Blazing at a speed that threatens to fold time in
Crop signing
, fresh to death, start signing
Grab cigarillos, we leaving in t-minus
Gold diggers, grab picks, start mining
Expertise needed, proceed to start climbing
Or give 'em two shoulders, born from cold climates
Hitting hyper drive in the whip that you're hype to drive
Space invaders clicked up with one side
With 2-bit movements we leave 'em stranded on stupid
Smoking Earth and regrouping, reach the moon then we moon them
This journey is strange as the range that I reach when I'm shroomin’

"Red, White & Blues",Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"America, I love you
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cuss you
Throw a middle finger up and say…
America, my love’s true
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cut you
Pull out an AK and spray
But that ain’t love

And on this long road to perdition
You might wanna use my navigation system—my wisdom
Shine light through this black prism
My rhythm let it guide you through baptism
Word to Shirley Chisolm, I’m truly tryna blaze trails
Write back senders of the hate mail, that keeps comin’
Caged bird still singing, chain gang still drummin’
100 miles and we still runnin’ 400 years
Give me a pound of Bob Marley
American flags strapped to the back of black Harleys
And if we burn you down it’s to begin anew
Let’s pull the sheet off of our history and bid adieu

America, I love you
Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cuss you
Throw a middle finger up and say…

Even after everything you put my blood through
Every descendant of a slave ought to cut you
Pull out an AK and spray

Banner in the sky, the U.S. is alive
Everything before it absorb it or let it die
Daughter of four fathers, no momma to get it right
Raised and became a beauty with something ugly inside
Growing up abused with bruises of different hues
Read, white lies now our lady sings the blues
Over C notes while we broke and see votes for people
Both villain and hero, competing stroking her ego
That talk the talk come time to walk do absolutely zero
Cheer us on the court but when it’s foul we get no free throw
But we go hard off hope and for the love
With all my heart still covered in blood

Like a beauty from the heavens up above
But hold her tight you ‘bout to see close up
Past smooth skin you’ll find something so rough
Can we keep her true?
I don’t know (I don’t know)
What to do (What to do)

But I don't think we need to let them go
Can't promise you Rome or St. Tropez

Baby doll can I call in a favor
If you trust me, I trust you
We must to
Get past times we cuss through
While we stand swearin like we in front of judge who
Evers on TV, you know what I mean
Cus whatever you seen be it debit or green
Natti came up on from chasin a dream
But yet, like a lil free Red Corevette
Sweet on the streets, worth less when its wrecked
Work, stress, and sweat, this life is a test but
Believe its gonna be all gravy
We be runnin in the sun to lay where it's shady
But not fast, fun filled with laughs
Can't take a trip to fall runnin to first class
How I wish the woods would up and disperse cash
Til' they do its me and you and where I'm taking you last
Lil' bathin suit, me grabbin yo ass
Past borders with waters as clear as your glass, so
Let's go down Mexico, where the
Reefer is cheaper and the sex is slow, c'mon

I know these dreams are make-believe
But I don't think we should to let them go
Can't promise you Rome or St. Tropez
But one day we might make it to Mexico
I know our dreams can make believe
But I don't think we need to let them go
Can't promise you Rome or St. Tropez
But one day we might make it to Mexico

How about sex on the beach? Right
Dos Equis? Right, under red light
Special, sidewinder track through sand
Swim a lil' bit, dance when we back on land
Darlin, whatever floats your boat
From Kentucky well water to whale watchin off a back porch
Smoked out, rotisserie turning
A lil tequila, some kissin and burnin
But anyway, that's after words are said
The ring bearers, the flower girls, the I Thee Weds
But that's miles away like your smile today
I'm feeling lower than the Nile in May
Cause all I know is I don't know and you don't either
All I know is that we need us
And plus we know, that I ain't paid
Yet all we think is I'm gone lead us
Together, Forever
Girl that's a pressure unmeasured
No lesser your treasure
Cause even the Reverend would tell ya
That heaven's no better
Heaven's no better, than you

Now we weeping to the sound from the color of the ground
Down in (Georgia)

Georgia, my state my home
For 17 years learned right from wrong
Cried saline tears when I write these poems
As I made these fears give flight to song
The red clay stains the soles of my shoes
The red clay stained the soul of a fool
My grandparents told me the goal that you choose
When you realize the worlds only open to few
Will measure your worth, tether your hurt
It's that same search that can lead you to church
But if they have the time to hate a whole race
How do y'all have the mind to tell me about my faith?
Do y'all have time to discuss God's grace
If you're too busy studying the color of a face?
I don't follow man to avoid the disgrace
Of the close-minded culprits of southern mistakes
Glass houses built out of empty Coke bottles
Throwing rocks at statues of southern role models
Use to be followed by souls that are hollow
But had too much love to ever get swallowed
By the dark-hearted people that threatened my kin
Spit on my friends for the color of their skin
So when I think back to the clay that raised me
I thank God for the strong man it made me

Raised a man wearing Dad's pants plus her shoes
Never wavered in faith in her loving embrace
That Garnett Lamar Bush would find a way to be great
Even after plenty meals off juvie hall plates
Calls at prison rates, pushed back release dates
Only to come home to mere months of your smile
While the nigga you married to give me a dad behaved foul
Your massive stroke one of luck for him
Kept the house, bought a car and a truck for him
Loved my brother too much to go and orphan him
So his daddy walks this earth, the only man I hate
With the bitch he moved in a week after your wake
Sure as Georgia birthed me, in Kentucky my state
Seem empty without you holding your grandson
Who smiles at your picture, not a tooth in his mouth
So handsome, you had him like milk left out
You'da swore I had asthma as my breath came out
Missing you, feeling like the Lord did me bad
But somewhat greater later when he made me dad
Bittersweet symphony simply played in my pain
Encored by the tears that I strain to contain
But sometimes I can't help it, sometimes I'm so selfish
Feeling like God don't love you like I do

No rights, incites, the fight in you
For life you no nice, you no like my hue
You strike we stand straight as a stripe on cue
And you ask, why we burning up the neighborhood?
As if the ghetto was created for the greater good
It’s even burning where the savior stood
We trying to self destruct this what will make you do it
Tryna find a nugget of truth in something
Other than art, somewhere other than youth
It’s all lies everything under your roof
To learn that history’s been slanted just to keep you aloof
It reaches moments, when even the righteous choose violence
From silence to siren a seismic environment
In life’s maze, maybe what’s left is the right way
I hate to blacken yo white day, but old heads sayin’

Hear the brush with death painting Crimson across the ground
Down now, get behind something
A cause or some cover, take aim or take suffering
News cameras never get the pause
Only want the rumble in the jungle when they popping out the claws
Civil rights suddenly got a clause
Declaring martial law, too many ninjas tightening up they bras
Being lioness doesn’t make it a lion less
And hunting down the Cubs is good way to lie in rest
Yes, stress and pressure bust pipes
Know it ain’t fun when the rabbits behind the sights
Seeing fires burning as bright as the city lights
Fueled by revolt its highest voltage ignite
Generations behind with numbers in decline
Are now the ones peeking out the blinds in these times saying

Why them people outside
Tryna keep them young boys quiet
Get low, why? Them young boys wild
Lookin’ at ‘em ‘bout to start a riot

“D” for devotion, what’s the commotion?
You ask why we burn up the streets that we live on
Did we get that notion from across the ocean
Such self destruction, pain and the misery
We know nothing of infamy, let’s roll play the history
Book; reverse psychology the apology
That civil war wasn’t fought for me, it was economy
Look, Abe freed the slaves, date recorded
But it took a hundred years to piss in the same toilet
Abe freed the slaves, date recorded
But it took a hundred years to piss in the same toilet

Why them people outside
Tryna keep them young girls quiet?

And taught that God needs negus us in full submission

Ha, Braille, a little louder

You're not fond I've never been who I claim
You can't tame the lion once it breaks out the cage
Once it breaks out, all over my face
Put your brakes on, stop the motion
Robotic movement, rusted by the rain of my father
Two sided, two names
Splashin' water retaliates
Flood to the surface of my lyrical percentage
Verbally aggressive, abusive attendance
Unexplained anger slaps my style senseless
How dare I mention mistakes and intentions?
Another star in my collection
The stars I've collected fell from the sky
I keep fallin', who let my hopes rise?
No parachute to provide safety, take me
Away from this shallow tide, from the shallow minds
The walls keep closin' in, I've opened every door
The hinges just always squeak
I need to loosen up, put it all behind me
And if you're searchin', lost is where you'll find me

October 27th, 1995
The day I found out my sister was no longer alive
Now I'm the oldest sibling
With her no longer living on this sad day
Decided to give up the bad ways
And to be a model for my younger sister
Wasn't the dumbest (___)
But my education was just car heists, burglury, urban liqour
The sort of fingers being curved on triggers
And I knew for certain, if I continued, living life all simple
Jail would be the only institution I'd be able to get into
So I laced by boots
Hit the books, flip from crook
Hopped over my obstacles like rocks skipped on brooks
Music became my medication
Motivation for meditation
Far better than any perscription my man was makin'
Sometimes my head be shakin'
Wondering how my life would be
If things never changed, then she could be beside me
But I discard the hypothetics
Won't let stress slice my lettuce
Theoreticaly, she just moved on ahead of me
So now my life's patterned across the same finsh line
Live right any part of me, that's insane is put to rhyme
Occassionally flames took to pine
Sometimes looked for wine
When I'm in binds I grab the Holy Book to find
A revelation to raise me out of this mental mess
And remember my life being blessed
Isn't coincidentalness
A simple test we face daily can drive us crazy
Missing Children, the confused adults loosin' hope
A noose from rope can dead it
But I won't let it take over me
Got somebody on my soul's shoulder lookin' over me",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-missing-children-lyrics

Where the trains don't ever stop

Ain't no smellin' what the rose got cookin'
How many flights just got charged for rebookin'?
Google Maps, backpacks, wrong routes tookin'
Yet through all the bullshit, we keep pushin'
Long as we got sweets that we can keep kush in
Me and Deac lost like change in seat cushions
Tryin' to find the right highway, the high way
Speedin' to catch time, stopped on a dime for
Five 50 pound turkeys crossin' I-9
We lookin' at the weed like we lost our mind

On the road again, the journey to the unknown again
Another episode when you're supposed to end
Week after week, test my patience
Sleep deprivation's the key to miss three destinations
Passed out drunk, couldn't speak, every nation's
Itinerary's missing the week's reservations
I'll rest my feet where the peeps don't know the Strange
Lucky I'm a creep and the streets don't know my name

We've seen so many towns and I got so many memories
But one comes to mind the first time we hit up Helsinki
We did the show and hit the after-party
One girl hit the bathroom, I went after, probably
It was totally destroyed, and I ain't talkin' about the feces
The toilet was lyin' on the floor in pieces
She literally shitted in the toilet so hard
That it split and got obliterated, had to get her load off

Nothing but strangeness
Nothing but strangeness
Nothing but strangeness

We're down in Jozi, South Africa, greet our brethren
These women got me thinkin' dirty thoughts like I'm Devin

Sayin' ""White boy, where you'd learn to dance?""
We're at Adelaide, Australia with our promoter lost
What's that pill on the pool table? That's an E, somebody dropped it
This is 2pm, without hesitation he drops it
Like ""I felt like partyin' anyways,"" aw fuck it

In the rain, we ran from Miami Hurricanes
And left lanes on Autobahn lanes
With foot on the gas, GPS on the dash
While all the names looked the same on the signs we passed
We've chased beers on Aspen streets
And caught eyes in Alaska that lasted weeks
Strippers took my mojo with cheeks in Santa Fe
And in the Netherlands I was asked to pull Santa's sleigh

The tour gospel according to Suffa
Every city looks the same lookin' up from the gutter
So hook me up with another round, ""Dude they're lovin' the sound""
So much the groupie's back stage give eachother a pound
Meal recognize meal
And Debris' so hungry on the mechanized wheel
You got a set of ideals? Leave them shits on the tour bus
And serenade a beer like ""Bitch, just the two of us!""

We're back for another round, SouthernUnderground
We ain't following that traditional cookie-cutter sound
Those that act like punks, treat 'em like trunks and shut-em-down
Riding sound waves without sails, oars, or rudders now

Other clowns suck worse than funnel clouds
One verse and your lungs are drowned with much dirt and rubble now
I've come to Earth to hunt em down, spit linguistics, pick up bitches
Jizz on big tits and get your mistress to do my dishes

Cannibalistic, intangible mechanical misfit
Scandalous dipshit who's beats are too clean
So I'm back with some dirty tracks that were dubbed and played
Through an 8-Track and my grandma's hearing aid

I'm afraid, though, we rap for food, we're still hungry
In cyphers eatin' up every muh'fuckah amongst me
People try to axe stupid and stumped (HOT!)
So much proof in me that I'm drunk and stumbling

Mmmmmumblin' some thuggin' shit is not a sin to me
But doesn't hip-hop need a little positivity?
It's all guns and slangin' caine
We need some upliftment in the streets, somebody call David Blaine

Fuck positivity. I'll bang David Blaine's favorite dame
Make her say my name and hog her hedge like a SEGA game
Stay insane, take her chain to sell on Ebay for change
And use the money for weed to ease her labor pains

I'm offended!

Why? Cause she's pregnant and smoking weed?

No, cus he let her toke for free, that's not how its supposed to be
But fuck it, you can find me at home lonely
Praying to my Eminem shrine holding a rosary

I can battle rappers for cash or sell trees
But I feel like Will High, cause I just wanna drop an LP
Respect when it drops, if not I'll make your girl put her breath on my cock
By tellin' her it tastes like peppermint schnapps

And after doing the grown-up, sit with her in soap suds
Roll up, some wack distribution and smoke BUDS
For fuckin' with my paper, getting me hype as a coke rush
It's Cunninlynguists bitch, loving this since Cold Crush
Y'all ain't ready

Sunset...
Sunrise...
Sunset...

Life is so beautiful
But sometimes I feel so unsuitable and it drowns out what's musical
And then I just find myself drinkin' and thinkin'
Making no turns yet my signal is blinkin'
Feeling bad cause no judge is giving me ten
Breaking rules to get up out of the deep end
On the verge of having trouble begin
Drama never leavin'
(Hot!) is the weather where I'm from
(Hot!) is situations that come
(Hot!) is how people get when
They're stuck in a pit, world not giving a shit
Life is suppose to be beautiful, but it's a crucible
Turning me into a person brutal who's
Psycho-dependent on money, bitches, drugs
Funny business stuff, can I give it up?
Yes I love, to get paid, get laid
Get drunk, get high, but then I hear kids cry
Saying that they need a model to follow
But I still find a liquor bottle to hollow

Samples Fiddler on the Roof
Sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time
Insecurities tingle racing up my spine
Facing crime in an eye to eye, head to head
Thinking of how to get dough to bread, keep roses red
I realize that my life is composed of the actions I take
Combined with the feelings I hold
But sometimes negativity molds a heart
From its start it's just trying to get over
But you can't let it fold tha soldier
That from it's inception, needing lucks blessing from clovers
Cause when it fights, it strikes, it slices, it bites
From morning to night, back through darkness to light
It's office is yo' life, builds a fortress that's tight
You can call it Christ or whatever you like
But to ignore it is yo' right, you deal your will
You reap what you sew, you till your field
But post battle, who will - heal - your shield
So many vices you can sacrifice, kill and grill
Cause you gotta see that the world will confuse you
With abused clues
I flip through news
And see that the world's a treasure chest of misused jewels
Who can't maintain... from sunrise, to sunset.. they face pain
There used to blue skies got grey stains
And are surrounded by friends who got snake fangs
But you gotta block it
Don't avoide it, destroy it, throw it up in a box and then lock it
Cut power when docs try to shock it
Cause that ain't the shit you should welcome your block with",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-sunrise-sunset-lyrics
Nasty Filthy,SouthernUnderground,2003.0,"Word to the holes on my socks and my nose full of snot
I got dope flows for shows but got no one to watch
I got no dough for clothes but got hoes on my jock
But they don't know I'm broke cause I told em I'm not
Yo... Who said underground ain't supposed to be hot?
I remember spinnin' records back before people stopped
Now they spinnin CDs they download and get props
Livin life for the ice like their soul's on the rocks
But ... down here shows we know how to rock
And on wax we rap for food, like the old one we dropped
Look at me! I been eatin Cherios out the box!
I'm so skinny I get lost in my clothes when I walk!
But ... if you relate, press record on ya box
Grab a pack of ramen noodles, let it boil in a pot
And if you been here before you know not to talk
Cause I love the underground. It's the road to the top

It's just another episode from the independent penniless
My D&D studio's a multitrack minidisk
I'm bankrupt for life and past due on all my loans
Got these bill collectors trying to reach me through studio phones
How can I stress less these damn fools be calling Freshchest
Saying they gone put a freeze on my next test press
Got an 97 BMW you might say it's fresh
I got it brand new and I ain't made a single payment yet
Be damn if they ass'll get it as long as I'm athletic
But with the Bad Luck I got Seven Years Of bad credit
If you see me wit' a TV in the back of my car
Don't get twisted and start thinking I'mma spectacular star
I got a TV in the front too it's packed in the car
I'm taking it to da pawn shop but I won't be back for it tomorrow
I got a ton of bills sittin here just chillin for at least a week
One day maybe I'll turn'em into Pete Rock beat CD's

Everyday stuck 'tween a rock and a hardplace (It's that nasty filthy underground)
So many obstacles making my heart race (It's that nasty filthy underground)
It's that nasty filthy underground
That naaaasty, filthy underground

Now, which of you dude's a vet?
When I could drop a double LP from a duel cassette
No MIDI to sport for... when I'm bringing the water
I get the vocals straight off the tape of my Mini Recorder
In your city, with a label budget of 450
Empty Oatmeal box, for a kick that's so gritty
A jansport with cds in it
With turntables on a floor model with the TV in it
You ain't all that cause you can afford DATs
I got more wraps than Claus packs when rollin four tracks
And I can only bag beats if them joints is mad cheap
Record right into the headphones - son that shit sounds mad street!
Y'all take the PC way, let ya CD's play
I rock a 120 Minute TDK
Hey! Looking for a way to the hype
""Welcome to the underground!"" Shit, that's just a day in the life

Rents due, in less than 2 weeks now
Label's calling, claiming they loving my street sound
(They on the west coast!) iIm thinking I'm pacific sea bound
Days passed, now they're saying that they'll catch me on the rebound
Next day at my job, clock in and my boss watches
Making sure that I properly stack boxes
The tick-tock on the clock seems to be moving in slo-mo
Waiting on 4-so I can go home and work on my promo
I'm writing so many dope songs (but who's hearing 'em)
Deacon hits the open mics (but who's cheerin' him)
Feeling nasty, filthy, or any of those synonyms
""Without Me"" the games the same, I ain't Eminem
I'm just a broke rapper, southern backpacker
Watchin' all these wack niggas and all of their cash stackup
So next Thursday when my paycheck is sent
Will it be for that studio time or rent... I don't know yo

So many obstacles making my heart race (It's that nasty filthy underground)

Ain’t No Way,Will Rap for Food (Deluxe Edition),2001.0,"There ain't no way {*repeat 8X*}

They don't understand, they do not fuckin' understand
The shit is serious, it's like, I'm not gonna let
I'm not gonna...
There ain't no way, I'mma let any motherfuckers
There ain't no way I'mma let a motherfucker hold me down
There ain't no way, I'mma let em tell me that I'm not..
Yo there ain't... yo check it out

There ain't no way I'mma let it happen, I'm stayin' to myself
Playin for my health
Relayin mesages that I felt
On the course of my life, till I'm divorced with my life
The plans to be stable enough to have two dogs and a wife
Since I was offered my life, I tried to make the best of it
And make it stand out until Mother Nature's digested it
With the sense to beware of death
But strength to not be scared of death
You don't understand that, then you really not prepared for death
Document that and learn it
I've been a hermit while twistin' that green like Kermit my team like burnin'
I'm from where chicks think they're too super to hear rappers bustin
And act like they're all that after liposuction
Radio sucks like sluts when they like corruption
And haters be so full of shit they need lip reductions
This is somethin' not for commerical radio
But any person's radio that's out there searching every show
For sick flows to sick beats
This where that shit be
And if I spot you like Mackenzie, I'll pop you like Popinski
Chop you up like minced meat
Toss you where the fish be
And leave your teeth marks where my fist be if you diss me
Listen and respect
I'm Mr. SOS
And I ain't takin' no shorts nigga, I'm quittin' cigarettes
From the south
A true Cuba-Rican reachin' your standards
And what you really have to understand is
There ain't no way

There ain't no way to take us out
I told y'all don't sleep on the South
No way {*repeat 9X*}

Ain't no way, they just... hehe, they just ain't gettin' it
Plain and clear they ain't gettin' it, step away, you gotta undersand it

Yo, I've been done wrong, fronted on, told that I'll never make it
People have dissed my songs and underestimated
All the attacks have been steroids makin' me stronger
Like dyin' from polygraph test shocks you couldn't be wronger
Motherfuckers wanna play around I recommend Tonka
Niggas thinkin' shit's sweet watchin' too much Willy Wonka
I don't really want the fame I wanna gain respect
Block my path and I'll make a passin' lane through your neck
I'm tired, frustration got me wired to blow
One reason I'm quick to drink or fire the dro
The harder crass pull me down, then the higher I go
There ain't too many musicians who ain't dealt with liars before
So I, flow wise, stay awake like a coke high
My words my, James Bond, watch you with my Gold-Eye
Dealin' with snakes thinkin' they so sly
Most of them is pussies but have never been between a ho's thighs
You can hold my, dick, if you really want a piece of me
Biters illegally, tryin' to tap into my frequency
Hopin' they'll be seein' me, art I've created recently
And then they use all my shit in battles when they beef with me
Bitch, here's your collar and your bone
Not even gonna dog y'all
Stay in the backyard where you belong
Only worthy of being a topic in a song

Fear,"Sloppy Seconds, Vol. 2",2005.0,"Fear is nothing more than a feeling
You feel hot
You feel hungry
You feel angry
You feel afraid
Fear can never kill you

Now who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?
That’s if you can admit it if you get that shook
Cause everyone’s been in a bit of a pinch that looked a bit bad
Couldn’t predict that you would live past where you stood
I’m scared of God coming back, asking if I’ve read his big black book
While I’m mid-splash up in a bitch’ ass in a bath room
Nothing gets stashed if you live crass under a glass roof
I’m afraid, but I act natural.
 
On tours I can’t sleep
Hoping there’s nothing we crash through, while on board in the back seat
Since I nearly lost my life and my wife in a taxi
The echos of the impact retroactively attack me
I’m afraid of having a baby that lacks feet
Afraid of rugged terrain and plunging a plane head first in a vast sea
I’m afraid of any school-aged child that packs heat
Or the feeling of not being able to wake up from a bad dream
I’m afraid of wasting years of my life on this rap scene
Or Seeing my mother pass without grasping the brass ring
So many tragedies happen in mass on the flat screen
But it’s never as real as hearin’ your family’s last screams
Cause god didn’t make us to die! (so what?)
So fear is an interim instinct given to keep us alive
So when you feel the chills reel up your spine
And the adrenaline fills you, don’t stress
Cause fear can still kill you


I’m known as a brave guy
But to say I’m fearless is to say lies
Some I might have until my days die
My fears are few, but powerful
When the days done and your demons come to devour you and kill if you allow them to
Feelings I’m familiar with known as a grown man
Heart pounding will make your spine shudder like a cold hand
Nothing logical about it, wild, irrational, makin' your mind clouded
Can you explain yours? I doubt it
Why do thoughts of failure make me uptight
I don’t swim
Cause the fear drowning wakes me up nights
I don’t win
Stare the nightmare in the eye when I stood at my pop’s grave
Was not afraid of death, but with his I was not brave
He was proud but didn’t live to see me a make hot stage
I cry to see his pride when I rock and got praised
That’s why I spot days, it’s more than a clock’s hours
Refusal let the fear block power

Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo I’m 23 started writing in my late-teens
Got with PMD’s Hitsquad when I was 18
Thinkin' I’m the nicest
My first song of great means
Naive, thinkin' I’m one step away from this great dream
Had plans for the top even had fans on my jock
Listenin' to my old shit, I know why my manager stopped callin'
Gotta take advantages, not often niggas want to put you on
I need a hand just to stop fallin'
Fall away from my dreams
And I didn’t go to college cause your boy was supposed to go all the way to the green
All the way to the scene of Biggie’s performance on ‘The Show'
Imagine I saw my face on the screen, damn
I try to tell myself “I won’t fail""
But if I do ain’t no ""Oh well""
What the fuck do I do if I don’t sell?
I’m scared that I’m wasting my life being Joe Schmoe with no dough
I'mma take a .44 and I’m wasting my life, fuck that


You may think I’m frontin', but let me tell you I ain’t scared of nothin'
And nowadays you always gotta be prepared for somethin'
Cause life is a game that we play
The chips fall where they may but most times you don’t land where you want to
There were days when I would have said I was afraid of heights
When I was younger I couldn’t go to sleep without the lights
But when I got over it I really started noticin'
We only fear a situation when we ain’t controllin' it
I would have seen more scary movies if somebody woulda told a kid
That when you turn the TV off the monsters go away
You know they say there’s nothing to fear, but being afraid
And I’m afraid I never seen the difference being scared made
Except for opportunities to advance going to waste
I never ran so you ain’t got to worry about me giving a chase
I don’t give a fuck
If I’m cornered with a barrel to my face
And niggas claiming that they really ain’t afraid to catch a case
That’s bullshit
Cause a nigga that was ‘bout it would’ve pulled it
And the fear in his eyes say he ain’t go not bullets
Then, once I realize that he ain’t gonna do shit
Be afraid, I got one too dog, and I ain’t afraid to use it",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-fear-lyrics
Broken Van (Thinkin’ of You),Strange Journey Volume One,2009.0,"""Sittin' on a highway again in a broken van
Thinkin' of you again""

In a high haze, looking at my eyes glazed
With night rain, nice Jane, and the highway
The hindsight come and hit you from the blind side
Deep in the heart, the inner parts, where you find pride
Heavy thinking about the shit we should of did
Instead of sitting sideways like some lunatics
We done took a beating that done put us on our knees
And don't even hear the click click when I turn the keys
Neglected all the checklists, proper maintenance
Spark plugs, wires, the bleedin' brakes and shit
Stupid
We was too busy screamin'
Radiator hot, then motherfucka steamin'
Transmission locked up, lack communication
And radio done take the music out of conversation
Got me sittin' looking silly on the side of the road
I rather keep it moving hitch a ride in the cold

Thinkin' of you again
Thinkin' of you

Her ambition faulty as my transmission
When pulled off the fluid her ass'll keep shiftin'
One touch, is a clutch, I had to keep stickin'
And my feelings died out, the spark is just missin'
This bitch won't put it in park and just listen
I keep reminiscing 'bout how she first started
Before it all turned to scrap, I'm broken hearted now
When the rubbers gone I slide to new targets
What fueled our desire put a hole in the sky
She was bound to the ground and I wanted to fly
Drove me crazy how she fronted like she wanted to die
Needing a jump, in her life so she'd break down and cry
But I still look for girls with pipes just like her
Junk in the trunk, and headlights just like her
Now, when I walk to the bus stop in the rain
I pause and catch myself thinking of her game
Mayne


With every single penny that I put into this transmission
It's a wonder that you're screechin' and you can't listen
The ambition of this salesperson pricin' me her quote was high
Still with primer for a coat, I'd buy ya
Like let's make a deal, shake hands
I'm missing the engine but still such a great van
Her piston is hissin' with 80's drama and the whole nine
On top of that, my baby's mama had to cosign
If a piss stain can locate a fire
I can reshape the bent frame and rotate the tires
While hand signals switch lanes
Though it's not a terrible perk
The radio is only AM and barely works
Still, for a few weeks
You could see me leaned back, smilin', excited on the blue streets
But now you're on E, something in your inside's blown
And I'mma have to hitch hike home
Goddamn it",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-broken-van-thinkin-of-you-lyrics
Mr. Morganfield & Ms. Waters (A-Side),Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"Before Rose reached full bloom, nourished in a smoke filled rooms
Cherished in a juke joint
 with a pocket size organ 
under full moon
Sea of black skin, packed in still feeling free moving to the blues
Mr. Morganfield
 
was in a brand new field where he could pick the rules
Cotton filled days, hardened fingers,
 
chiseled out a stone voice singer
Father figure raising hell with her in a sea of hooch and malt liquor
Ernie Burns gave her life pictures, memories for everybody's eye
Checkered roads round Mississippi, making moves turned to chess in the chii
Raised by a mannish boy, watched him testify in hi-fi
Shaping ears all over in a time that he knew would soon pass by
Muddy waters fed the roots
, 
now everybody reap the fruits
Muddy waters fed them roots, 
now everybody got some juice
, so

Seen her work from nine to unconscious
Steady tryna figure it out
Critics and Holy Rollers they named it all nonsense
They didn’t want that shit in they house
Glass half full, waters emptied out content
Could make a mic remember her name
Soul on the floor, every night this was promised
These melodies that put an end to the pain
Backed by a band of brothers, expanding colors
Try and imagine new land discovered
That's Nawlins, Mizzou, South Philly
That's B-More, Harlem in NYC
That's where they skit-skat, melodic rap
Over the 7th and 11th, can’t call that crap
Godmother showed up and she showed out
Till a rose filled up it’s pot and broke out grown

But love is just a word, so

Hey, you met her at a house party, bent
You grip a glass while she flicks the sticks
Fireball shots and the shit seems lit
But yo she knows if your pipe game is sixteen bits
She a true player in the literal sense
Got a flat twist and a cinnamon tint
Home slang hips with a venomous spit
The type you can't get without a gentleman's wit, but
You bum ride while she glides in the BM
Called out at home trying to slide in the DM
From AM to PM she servin' toys
Her red bottoms covered in the blood of fuck boys
On the soles of her primrose pumps
You find the soul of a two-pump chump
Who refuse to kick rocks in some beat up Chucks
So just let her put her feet up, cuz
She ain't playin' with you

Yeah, huh, she switch hips and the thighs switch wit' her
Warms up the room like Sunday dinner
Mid winter
Tap water game won't wet her
'cause she can hear the blues more better
Even with your shoe game together
Gold links for miles
She kinda like black dynamite with winks and smiles
She prefers goals over gold
She can see the diamond in the coal, Which is worth tenfold
Can't handle blunt? Don't roll
Find a smaller mind with a booty on swole
You can swear her but Hollywood’s cold
Clamor for the glamour 'til the bitter gets old
And rubs off
Go from one in a million to one of many
She can wish you well
Probably flip you a penny
Ain't tryna mate for life at age twenty
But needs more than sex in the city, say

Ooo you gon' run away
Say ooo middle of the night
Ooo found love at first sight
May not love for life, but that's cool
Say who, finds love at one sight
Say who, always loves you right?
Say who, middle of the night

Yeah it's me, surprised that I'm writin'?
Well not really, I'm sittin' at my computer just typin'
Heard you were sick
Would have found out last week had I called
But to be honest
I don't feel the least bad at all
Yeah I know that sounds fucked up but you made me like that
Look at my childhood, I can't believe you played me like that
You was never around, promises was all you resort
No child support not as much as a call to my moms
I went through nights with no dinner lookin' bummy and skips
Could go no where in school with no money for trips
Gettin' cracked on by honeys and shit
Strugglin'
That's why I don't listen to your lectures on hustlin'
Cause we had nothin'
Stuck in the hood always
And you refer to the 80s as the good ole' days?
Well they wasn't for me
I guess things went all your way
But I ain't done keep reading I got more to say
I know this all seems abrasive
But look what I'm faced with
Missed opportunities
Missed chances missed places
I looked at what others had and I couldn't get basic
Deprived of so much that's why I'm stuck with this hatred
I went through problem after problem thinkin' you wouldn't care
All simply because you wasn't there
Just promise to visit and sorry's couldn't redeem you
It probably would have been better if I would never had seen you
Cause then I wouldn't have a face to place with the lies
And the disappointment that infected our lives
I guess that's why I'm so bothered now
And want to hit a motherfucker sayin' you your father's child
So I gotta be keepin' the faith
For them three girls of mine and I won't be repeatin' mistakes
That you made with me cause I don't miss my past
And every third Sunday in June you can kiss my ass

And I could feel it as a child growin' up

Many moons have cycled since the night you decided
To break out late and fade out into the silence
First born son still playin' in his diapers
Left behind ya
Kinda thought I'd never find ya
But guess what?
The human being you had deemed a mistake
Is now staring you in your face
It's a disgrace the way I was treated
Shit, you probably wish I got caught in the condom when my pops skeeted
Well fuck that I buck back all odds
And stuck straight through your façade of camouflage
You ain't my mom
You ain't nothin' but a heartless bitch
I'm starting to switch
Don't even start this shit
Tryin' to fabricate facts that my dad kidnapped me
It can't be nothin' but lies to try to trap me
In fact he
Packed me to Cali in '84
We found your crib but you never came to the door
Wouldn't answer the phone but you had to be home
Tragedy sewn
Yo, you had to know you were wrong
Reminisce and it's not surprising
Grew up so broke I thought the poverty line was the horizon
Many nights and days we stayed in shacks
Pops breakin' his back
Faded ass packs of food stamps
But karma's a double edge sword
So thanks for letting me borrow your fuckin' umbilical cord",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-family-ties-lyrics
Hypnopomp (Epilogue),Oneirology,2011.0,"Life is but a dream
Once two suns were born to
Nyx goddess of Night and Hypnos God of Sleep
The eldest was Morpheus, who lived in the visions of dreamers
Rising to his calling, meant someone must abandon all other paths
For the prospect of greatness
Thus heroes and kings called Morpheus, the destiny bringer
To accept his gift, required impossible risk
And loneliness in the midst of adoration
But to deny him - madness
Then, there was Phobetor, whom they called the dread crawler
For he dwelled only in nightmares
And fed on the acrid fumes of human fear
A shapeshifter, he appeared as the manifestation of terror
Forcing a choice between the path of uncertainty
And the path, of mediocrity
To meet Phobetor's gaze required great courage
To look away - shame
Only in the grey hour, in the moments of shadow and light
Will the balance of power dangle
Between the destiny bringer's favor

Valley of Death,Dirty Acres,2007.0,"Now I seen obscene times before this hip-hop game came
Like the cops that checked me, left me in mate
To a system where Gingerbread Men are to overbake
Put to work in the dirt for a buck and quarter a day
Choppin' down trees for the next prison that's made
And separate us from slaves for thirty dollars in pay
The jailer got a tailor and an F250
Standin' on Dirty Acres feelin' goddamn filthy
Natti stands for his, suckers crawl for others
Understand the biz, I suffocate undercovers
Cause somebody gets paid, our lemons are simply beginnings
My sweat been the sugar in some cracker's lemonade
Got my brother in Baghdad, hands clenchin' grenades
While we hustle like house niggas, try'na buy chains
Back asswards for try'na buy change
I'mma walk through the Valley and rally through my pains, nigga

I'mma wear your confederate flag and be a rebel
Burn this witch down, Gretel with heavy metal
Cancelled, for pissin' on our hopes and esteems
Since I's a youth seen it, seen it like they broke in my dreams
Weave it together, I need all the yarn you can swing
From filthy farms we learned about what type alarm you can ring
Are you gon' listen? It seems the only sense you got is vision
And since we shed our senses now the sense is steady slippin'
And since we stopped our youth from prayin' senselessness is livid
And the rich don't really give a fuck cause they don't gotta live it
I see hard livin' e'ryday, you never payed a visit
To ya'll the 'hood's a museum, in truth we just exhibits
In truth we just some digits, a means to an end
By any means from our KY we gon' win
Since ya'll won't listen, I oughta use fists in place of my pen
So then maybe all this shit'll sink in

Dwell in the Valley of Death, fell in the pits it holds
Been to the mountain top where streets are paved in gold
But I know ""Only God can put out our flame, until then we gon' face our pain""
And I know ""Only God can put out our flame
Until then we gon' stake our claim, on these Dirty Acres""",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-valley-of-death-lyrics
No Universe Without Harmony,Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"I mean, to put it simple and plain we're all vibration
All of us

You know that flicker in the eye? It's rhythm from the sky
And light was born before the world with all of you and I
We made from that underneath the faucet and the filling
When the universe is speaking just to listen, need the healing
Bow your heads, let me say a prayer for the Death
Sound is more than hearing, may you fill it to its depth
Music is divine let me climb inside your mind
Mystic ain't consistent wasn't cryptic before time
Existed to mention humankind can't visit
How is it we receiving these vibrations from beyond?
We can't see it like light and morning time
It's more like a magician waving wand
It shall remain after we dead and gone
In all the noise we made is part of lexicon
This phenomenon, it fills the spirit
If you sit in perfect silence you can hear it

There is no universe without harmony
There is no universe without harmony
There is no universe without harmony
There is no universe without harmony

Yo
We suffer from separation postpartum Birthing a Nation
Seeking change like the weather for the worse or for the better
Assumptions and accusations replace perspective and patience
Dropping slurs on your neighbor, plenty bleeping four letters
Supremacists fight for order, anarchists fight for chaos
Most the folks I know they out here fighting for a day job
Some just want watch on the sidelines
Murders in hi-def claiming they colorblind
Blocking out the hue that's uncomfortable to you ain't a condition
There's no corrective lenses for decisions
And if that cuts too deep there ain't no stitching that incision
Rigamortis in thinking keeps you stuck in one position
See the beauty in difference, race, color or creed
First step of growth is simply planting the seed
You hunger for peace it's something u gotta feed
You verse the universe, go ahead and concede, believe

There is no universe without harmony
There is no universe without harmony
There is no universe without harmony
There is no universe without harmony",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-no-universe-without-harmony-lyrics

Surrounded with evil
I take flight
Devils they take me

So I might fall

And gaze at the beauty

The sun went down
He's lost the crown


""...and since much of our basic desires
Involve those things which are taboo

Substitution, displacement, and other

Reaches for the Mop and Glo, lettin' that backside show

Avoiding eye contact before this lust thang grow
Damn! Miss Ma'am with the mammary glands
To hug you from the back I'd need two extra hands
Sex by the cans with the okra and yams, damn
Imagination pacin', turnin' me hound

Mind blind from video hoes and cable

Girl you so lovable
So soft and touchable
But I don't wanna fall (In love)
Completely huggable
Wonderfully fuckable
And you know that's what you are, you are

You're looking jazzy, with a touch of nasty
But you walk right past me, don't do me that way
I'm staring at you at the club for about an hour and a half
And you smelling like you just took a shower and a bath
And those curves? Aw, they strike a nerve
From your nose to your toes, your whole body's superb
And I'm sure you got a mind too
And with my head, I can get behind you
If you want something solid I got it
I keep my game and my thang polished
Huh, I'm just trippin', girl, let's just dip outta here

Puckering lips showin' me she got jaws to eat a

But Jesus, I don't mean to be in vain
But I'd tip ya with my tithe money just to get a name
Bartender, could you tell her to give me a shot
If not, Woodford on the rocks and make it a double
Might holla later on the block, not lookin' for struggle
But for an out of world experience hop in my shuttle
Fresh out the muzzle, trained like good hair
Come chop it up with me there's some good wood here
Get lucky in Kentucky if you play the odds right
Where brothers'll serenade a broad like

Dying Nation,SouthernUnderground,2003.0,"""There's an old saying in Tennesse—I know it's in Texas, it's probably in Tennesse—that says fool me once, shame on—shame on you. If you fool me you can't get fooled again.""

I live in a nation that relies on business and crime
And the leaders are politician guys livin' a lie
Who bullshit like everyone else for a nickel and dime
America ... just as corrupt as it is online
Using freedom and entertainment just to keep us sedated
But remember what the declaration of independence stated?
All men are equal and that's the way they're created?
But when that was written, black and white people were segregated
And this country still breeds racism, just not as blatant
To call us the land of the free is overstatement
Cause ain't NOBODY free. We all being watched quietly
National security's an invasion of privacy
Drug Trafficking, conspiracy, murder and piracy
What America can't have they take silently
Sometimes violently, open up your eyes and see
Even dirty money is supporting our economy
It's all backwards like negative split photography
But I guess that's the way it's got to be
United we stand on this land and we do all crimes
Facin' a Dyin' Nation listening for the new told lies

""Facin' a dyin' nation. Listening for the new told lies"" (x2)

I live in a nation where it ain't what's physical that fights us
Now it's silent strikes from political insiders
A black market government where being criminal is righteous
Ran by bloodlines that were dirty before Isis
The crisis has even spread to spiritual infestations
Confessionals filled with sexual molestations
Professionals so set on capitalization
They don't notice their children freebasin' in their million
Dollar basements
Babies having babies in the hood I grew up in
Hands are too small for the guns that they be bustin'
Schools underfunded, graduates retain nothing
On Capitol Hll it's barely a topic of discussion
Kids like, why should I think about college
When this hood situation is holding me hostage
And even if I fought and bought the knowledge
I'd prolly get shot 41 times by a cop over my wallet
Shiiiiit.. So wherever you are
Don't inhale the second hand smoke from its victory cigar
Motivate yourself don't just stand on the side
Facing a dying nation and listening to the new told lies


Somebody dial 9-1-1
It's mass confusion, mass contusions
At last we losin' Uncle Sam to a mass of tumors
And that's the rumor at least, it's soon to be seen
If its true that the beast is soon to decease
Catchin' blood clots in the crude oil
That runs through his veins and up thru his brain
Its tough to maintain
If he was low income he'd already been gone
Insurance paperwork gettin handled by Enron
And scandalous friends call to speak
Even Bill O'Reilly's wrapped in a hospital bedsheet
With a pointed hat, where the ointment at?
Wax the taxpayers backside for a tax hike
Woulda had a Catholic priest at his bedside
But they were too busy giving these Boy Scouts a leg ride
Temperature stay high but no pain
Cus the presidents Hooked on Phonics and cocaine
Product of old age and Alzheimers disease
Medical bills raised from all types of fees
Looks to the American people to show love
But his Social Security ran out - pull the plug

Running Wild,Strange Journey Volume Two,2009.0,"Everybody running wild, yeah
Tell me what to do
What the fuck is goin' on?
Well I know, well I know, well I know

So many baby mamas around we are all some motherfuckers
Surf's Up but it ain’t on some motherfucker
Most kingpin rappers is also undercover
Sleeping with the enemy on some under covers
Tide rolled in, bread so thin
Gotta keep corn on me like Thanksgiving
Still smoking, like the barrel of young ones
With big guns that will face grown men
Got guts 'till they see their stomach lining
I’m not fishing for compliments but keep a line in
Seeing the world like Jack with an axe
Peeking through the door towards the end of The Shining

Uhh! Robbing and rhyming is my drug
Not only the block but the microphone I hug
Tsunami flow, suckers act like they don’t know
But there will never be another MC like me 'till 5004
There will never be an MC like you 'till 5004? (Yup)
I rap like none of these rappers on earth, I’m not your average Joe
Space age pimpin' first verse now they have to protect the ho
All the way winos, trips and players in front the liquor store
Altercations and drama, riding around with them Lamas
Growing up in the ghetto where kids sell dope to their mamas
Bullet shells echo, men dead in the alley
It took nine hours for the coroner to come and pick up the body

Everybody running wild, yeah
Tell me what to do
What the fuck is goin' on?
Well I know, well I know, well I know

Say what I’ve seen, night time dream
(Evidence) that my life is serene
But the world don’t turn off evil regimes
Men will earn, getting burned for cream
It’s the same dots behind clouds and raindrops
Suns explode with rays of stray shots
It’s like drive-by murder when it stays hot
They shot the ground and grazed the grey lots
Grey box, same two-three steppin'
Blue jeans, blue hat, I need a weapon
Who’s next to play the execution of a chump?
When the shit go down we’ll see who choose to jump

Hey, can feel my hairs rise from the tension
On gentrified drive, you can smell the intent
I think the streets on fire with the engine
As the world burns let me turn to my incense
A nigga can’t sleep, they doing housecalls
All in the streets people living like outlaws
Listen to the fault line, you can hear the ground talk
'Till the clouds fall fear rains like drought’s off
Under the city lights, within shadows
Many men sling ground-stained Amaretto
Loud screams drowning out the whistle from the kettles
You can’t run from it, keep bringing you the ghetto

Everybody running wild, yeah
Tell me what to do
What the fuck is goin' on?

Takin’ The Loss,Will Rap for Food (Deluxe Edition),2001.0,"""You took an L you took a loss""

Battle Deacon & Kno you'll be takin' a loss
On the street or at a show you'll be takin' a loss
If you ain't rhymin' like this you'll be takin' a loss
Have you cryin' like a bitch when you takin' a loss

I stay dirty like Rastafarian piss tests
Stick dick between notebook pages
To show how I sex texts
Keep rappers in check like chess threats
Deacon the lone star flows hotter than tex mex
Givin' ears the best sex since 900 numbers
Rock all night like slumber
In a battle I Stone Cold stun the mic manager
Knowin' he amateur like minor league
Testin' me is like askin' a drownin' man to breathe
Better off waitin' in hell for a cool breeze
Beatin' me is impossible
Like a tank top with sleeves
My road rages
Drop fires and pop tires
I shock liars with the truth that I share like stock buyers
Retire and get your head right
Facin' me and lovin' life is a
Contradiction like an Amish website
Deacon the red light
Better yet the human pause button
Drop something that gets car stereos
Humpin' like dogs fuckin'

Battle Deacon & Kno you'll be takin' a loss
On the street or at a show you'll be takin' a loss
If you ain't rhymin' like this you'll be takin' a loss
Have you cryin' like a bitch when you takin' a loss

Yo, my middle names HUD y'all know the way I house kids
Force the mic into
Retirement like Jerry Krause did
Resoundingly found with classic verses
Amassing courage for the staff or 
Drastic wordsmith
Ask a surgeon
I bet he'll give you the answer
That this particular bastard is
Sicker than testicular cancer
Fixin' to smack you with no hesitation
Cause I can't see nobody beating me like
Stevie Wonder's gang initiation
My slang will stay patient
Till the clock strikes to slay
Fake men and lay waste with
The wacknesss
You better resort to drastic measures
Cause you couldn't fuck with me if I
Was ribbed for her pleasure
Me takin' a loss
Shit won't never be seen
Like David Duke wearing Phat Farm and Fubu jeans
Facin' me and you wanna know you chances, shit
Image John Rocker wavin' a rebel flag
In east Los Angeles
The same scandalous slang
Evangelists practically banned this the way that I
Fantastically damage crews
Your style is Max Headroom
While I'm off the wall like Foxy Brown's picture
In Kurupt's bedroom

Battle Deacon & Kno you'll be takin' a loss
On the street or at a show you'll be takin' a loss
If you ain't rhymin' like this you'll be takin' a loss
Have you cryin' like a bitch when you takin' a loss

Verbally I'm sky
Touch heaven when I barely try
You drop less then desert precipitation
Plus terribly dry
Whose ignorant?
Not I
Deacon's like ""That's my guy!""
I don't need digital mastering to spit hi-fi
Find me on the Enterprise sky divin' with Snipes
My Drop Zone will clear out all shit with one wipe
Quick to send cats to the one that runs life
Just for bringing a blunt butter knife to gun fight
If you think that the sun's bright
Well peep how I'm droppin' this shit
My shine's quasar
You think I'm mockin' God when I rip
No need for cockin' four fifth to
Clear the populace bitch
Beatin' me is like touchin' the bottom of
A bottomless pit (impossible)
My alias is time cause I'm unstoppable
Got Spock in the back admittin' that suicide is logical
I pocket tools
Meant strictly for droppin' fools
I wanna get signed just to show
Half dollar niggas are robbable
You got a problem dude?
We can handle this like men
Call your boys too, I'll happily cancel your friends
Put your game outta order
And pamper your hen
Cause this gin got me evil, darker than the answer to yang",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-takin-the-loss-lyrics
Makes You Wanna Cry,Strange Journey Volume Three,2014.0," {x4}
Ooooh I
Makes you wanna cry

I see crabs climbing to be free
Where dog eat dog is the royal decree
Trust nobody
Mayflower to teepee
Over the meek sin wins since B.C
You blame D.C
I blame life
She blames Allah
He blames Christ
We put out bounties
We pay that price
For green backs we back stab and won't think twice
It's more money, more murder, more homicide
Over dollar bills free will creates Amistad
I'm a slave
Hard to escape the cell
And I ain't brave just because I moved to ATL
Couldn't pay me well enough to sing your fairytale
The cherry L I'm smokin' doesn't choke me like the very smell of life
Raw and uncut
Sex, drugs and gun lust
Land of the unjust


I see
Men in chairs with suicidal tendencies and tears falling down
They say that time heals I feel the years falling down
Global warming, all the yields falling down
Sisyphis is dead all the hills falling down
Off to contemplate life, why my mama left me
You fucking right that's why I move like I'm a lefty
Correctly, I hear that smoking herb might correct me
Fuck a Zip Lock, put mine in a Hefty
It's heavy, while my mind feels like a Chevy
My mind feels, my mine fields like it's deadly
Deadly
Like death is my only option
Go with daddy or be left for adoption
Death is death though and life is a deadly toxin
What goes around comes around unless you're heavy boxing
Then you move in a square
This life up and down like how you move on a stair
Life isn't fair to that dude on the chair
And you got no move on that shit like that dude Fred Astaire

Jimi & Andre (B-Side),Rose Azura Njano,2017.0,"Before trap gods trapped god in a cellophane
A string of psychedelics grew from a better plane
He came to her
She laid claim to him
They blamed the world for pain, change, and sin
Nothing was protected
Love was eclectic
Sparking a land of ladies electric
He was playing fast and loose
While she played masseuse in effort to sooth a soul so reckless
Limbs so restless
From fighting the struggle
Even a kings reign
Can be found in a puddle
With plenty of her tears mixed in as the lights grew dim
With her whole universe tuned in
The Purple Haze left behind
As a long goodbye
To a clouds short life in the sky
Eventually rain down purple
On this tiny blue marble
As a soundtrack to when doves cry
Sometimes it's a...

Beautiful world
Dirty, cruel world
Wonderful world


I heard a little black rose croonin’
Musta had a bit of prunin'
Mournin turned noon
And little dew drops got her swoonin
Oh Lord
Found peace in a Bethlehem manger
Oh Lord
Fell fast as a feather in a vacuum chamber
Oh Lord
She from a mean street
Many envied all her green peace
Didn’t even want her in the game
Small change
From the cheap seats
Oh Lord
Watch her grow though
Made of seasonings that we don’t know
A seedling with a gold glow
Reaching through the snow slow
As predators lurk in the corn rows
In a world that led her to thorn growth
Met a man better than his wardrobe
Body language speaking in hormone
Oh Lord
What to do now?
The past got her confused now
Paint over the blue
Pain is nothing new
This queen got a new crown
Oh Lord
Let’s kneel and pray
Allow me put some skin on these words that we say
Oh Lord

I’m owed a seed I can sew into love

Break Even,"Sloppy Seconds, Vol. 2",2005.0,"Arrives alive, feet first, momma's little burden
Who grows to lust lavish living like daddy's little version
But the cops pop Pops on his grind from poor to riches
So a shackled man stands to name his first son Richard

Young,  realizing why, but he despises his daddy's lies
His sister, Karma, look just like his momma with daddy's eyes
He sit in apartment looking out the window with daddy's ride
His childhood passing by; he's growing too fast to cry

Too old to be told stories of knights in shining armor
That big sis, Destiny, recited nightly to him and Karma
Opposite bedtime, heard street tales of Papa's fed time
Rolling stone with skull and bones tatted across his neckline

He learned to throw rags and load mags before he could read
His momma spending her rent on Boy when there ain't nothing to eat
Tracking her arm up and turning cheap tricks for bumps
And he been checking the same empty refrigerator for months

Fast forward in time
(We are) searching for reason
(But we know) ain't no way to rewind
So we spend that time just trying to break even

Watching momma's body wither and hunger pains in his sister
From a teen to a king he stuck up his momma's mister
No more peddling poison for profit off in this household
Took Papa's strap and tap momma's dealer until he was out cold

Whatever it takes, he does it dedicated to his sister and mother
Learning the game by bagging zips with his cousin
Keeping the fridge full now, well he got dollars by the fistful
A car with a system and a yard full of pit-bulls

King Rich the rich king who's ride sits on things
And those who owe dough feel blows with gold rings
And momma raise Karma with Destiny right on her arm
In a project palace founded by violence, but far from harm

Ignoring his daddy's letters, but his sisters anticipate
The visitation day, but he's just focused on getting paid
He barely ever home, growing up alone
He had to rehabilitate his mom, keep his sisters from whoring


Now Rich is feeling himself, not concealing his wealth
And his cousin's loving his product and improvidence felt
He's crying for help, but Rich told him tighten his belt
And then Rich ditched his cousin, put his life on the shelf

He went from hustling to feed those in need to greed
And neglecting his cousin's progress, police is pleased
Cause he helping to crucify Rich with times and dates
Names and states on license plates of cars supplying the weight

So Rich got his niggas out pitching on the curbs
While his cousin with the law, jaw singing like the birds
Said if he take the stand they plan to send him to the burb
So he pitched Rich to the Dixon, sent them to the birds

Cased him, replaced his bracelet with cuffs and chains
A fucking chain he flushed so much he plugged the drain
Leaving his sisters and his mother with nothing but more problems
And his new cell mate is his 50 year old father",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-break-even-lyrics

That's because 95% of all dollar bills in the nation's capital has traces of the illegal drug. The largest study of bank notes has found that nearly 9 out of 10 bills circulating in the U.S. are tainted with cocaine

America's nose sniffing as its jaw ki-ki-ki-ki-kickin'
The sign says ""Bitches, form a line""
Politicians doing rails off a hooker's spine
Same shit that lock niggas up for trying to grind
Cause for the last ten years if you mix it with soda
Yet they used to use it to put the coke in the cola
In the nose of the stars, they getting smoked by the boulder
Even then they had to push it on the streets like a stroller
They shaking like Ray, twitching, scratching their shoulders
The war against drugs, who the fuck are the soldiers?
Without drug money, the economy fold up
Cops won't get paid to harass and roll up
Without niggas  and pots to blow up
Who gonna buy all these damn Beamers and Rovers
My kids sent up the river by lawyers and judges
Them same motherfuckers that's sniffing cocaine

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts say
90% of all money in the U.S. has traces of cocaine
Researches there believe that the statistics suggest
More Americans are sniffing cocaine at higher levels due to the recession

Listen, it goes one for the junkie, two for the fiends
Triple for the beams that help weigh out their dreams
You wanna meet Jesus, wait til it steams
Crack the code better, nigga's soul rose 
It seems, streets were flooded before New Orleans, we
Tried to kick it, but the shit just be...
All through the night for it critters be crawling
Help you transform, it's revenge for the fallen, strange
Slanging that Big Daddy Kane
For that juice, crews will make shit out your brains
Boost your morality, boosting your fame
Pigeons go loose to make a noose out your veins
Who, the vain, creators of the antic
Who wear it like a stain, self-maimed off your crackict
We're lost like signals, victims of static
For ways out of the madness we sniffing cocaine

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts say
90% of all money in the U.S. has traces of cocaine
Nearly 6 million Americans admitted to using cocaine at least once in 2009, making the United States the world's biggest cocaine market

Too many niggas talk hard then shit bricks when the beef hits
Fight night, where are you?

Real cats throw down while you hide your paws
You as soft as the gauze paramedics gon' wrap round yo' jaw
How you act up, don't back up your words just yo nerve
In a room full of goons you and yo' crew are hors d'oeuvres
Please, don't act like no killa if you ain't no gorilla

A bit of suspense, a nigga be in his dress

No toilet bowl, just a hole so you can wipe in it
A tormented soul till you grow old and ripe in it
Play your hand till the right suit fold
Bin Laden got Bush in a knight suit mode

I'd like a beautiful shorty that'll praise me right
I'll praise her back though, I'm not a selfish bastard
Struggle with big shit, but got this elf shit mastered
Time's are strange, I claim to be the man
Like I know God and can understand his ingenious plan
But I'm just a simple Joe, livin' low, avoiding conflict
Cookin' food for stereos, so feed your CD-ROM this
True, I've struggled, spent days in mud puddles
Shut up shit-talkers and made wanna-be thugs huddle
The world ain't all money, suckas and violence
Quit smoke from the fire-lips, protect your iris
Shit's hard, especially hits to scar the soul
That's why niggas drink and stress for cigars to roll
It's like the farther we go, we cover less distance

Scared by darkness, searching for beauty like Cinderella's man
But I'm no Prince Charming I form my share a folk
Hanging my own self, bad decisions prepare the rope
Strangled by pride, suffocated by lies
Showin' my pearly whites to disguise my prize
Missin' my sister, asking the Lord why did she die
Using her death to instill strength inside of vibes
I don't want old things I done to boomerang
Feelin' low-low, for sho Deacon pursued by shame
It get rough, and ain't enough to just think positive
Cause when nobody's helping me out then its hard to give
And go and robbin' shit, runnin' game on hoes
An un-tame negro, runnin' cain for dough
Acting insane, famous for bringing pain to foes
Knowing that shit'll come back and it'll rain for sho

Fame stickers in my mouth, cain sniffers on the couch
Walking the world and the crowds, shiftin' through trash

Mind Won’t Behave,"Sloppy Seconds, Vol. 2",2005.0,"Hook:
I try hard not to think of you
But my mind won't behave
To find a piece of love I can save

There you are in your car, blowing breeze through your hair
We ain't even met yet, so for no reason you there
Riding on my mind with your seat on recline
Looking fine as wine, sitting in a cellar with time
I engage ways to exchange names
 in your gaze
Minutes became days, watching sun glaze in your face
Step out your ride, guys hinting at hitting what shakes
But I'm wrapped up in your thighs, complimenting your waist
And can taste that strange fruit, no make-up you plain cute
Define you as a dime? That's a crime, that ain't loot
That buys gumdrops and blow-pops for cheap cravings
You diabetic sweet, I need shots for behaving
I wonder, are you a figment of slumber?
Is my brain a mess, do you exist in the flesh?
Are you front row at the show with breasts that peak through your dress?
If you don't let me know, I'll go and speak to the rest, because...


Girl I was caught up, soon as you entered my line of sight
Flashed that ass, I'm like bass, hooked to shining light
A bright quasar, all on my radar, like a twister
Should have ran for shelter, but I'm storm chasing sister-
Girl, Mrs. Curls 
from a different world
Like Dwayne Wayne and Whitley
, 
couldn't claim dame with hickies
We was young, dumb, I'm full of cum, yup, we all been
On phones late as fuck with a love on, through yawning
Till morning came, walked home alone in the rain
Smiling, cause I just put my finger all off in her thang
You was a gift Ms. Delicious, non-malicious
My interest, aged with interest
Fine as fuck, caught a fine for finding my luck
Can't really combine in one rhyme, understand it be tough
But I can't really have you walk away from family blood
And if I promise I'm your man to be, that's vanity, cause
I love you, I need you, I just can't let you go
But to keep you's to mistreat you, and I'm thinking only heaven knows that...


Yes, it's time to unfasten my belt cause I've been eating with my eyes again
Before you I wasn't receiving all my vitamins
Adoring you forced me to paint the town, now my mind is red
But now my eyes are red as love is nearly lying dead
This is a body that, I used to lay beside it and
Time & time again, head first diving in
Swimming I was sure this was a gift that God had sent
Then drowning became a song I don't want inside my head
 and
Can't get it out, what an unfortunate mishap
To grab a new spouse would be an uncordial mismatch
But everyday she places razor blades where her wrists at
My boo-boo's got a boo boo, to kiss that cannot fix that
Regardless I try, cause removing her outta my life
Would be like removing a part of the sky
Harder, but if I don't bother to try
I have to keep watching her die, and I don't want to..

Harsh heat make looking down the street all wavery
Ladies that bundled up in winter, unwrap and wave at me
Wanna have it made in the shade beneath the canuhpee
Canopy, can it be beautiful? The season
Summer under investigation, give niggas reasons
To shorten up they fuse, look violent on the news
More families to sit sobbin silently on the pews
Over stepped on shoes or some other shit that's petty
Guns and sun equal the relationship that's deadly
Hear it in this medley, feel it in this song
Feelin the burn, somehow we un-learn our sense of wrong

For straps to stay in the home of us that ought to be grown
No more altercations where bullets gotta be thrown

To Be For Real,Strange Journey Volume Two,2009.0,"From make believe
Well I want to be for real (x3)

Some are real as the line in their big face bill
Others are counterfeit living off of Xerox meal
Quickly coming out their mouth like they put out grills
See the traffic in the sky, but you take off still
Living the high life or limelight, I just like the light lime
Fabricating your life, I just have to write mine
Be ahead of the game, got to have the right mind
I just do it while others just want the Nike signs
I respect grind, finish line is asinine
Don't grown folks quit stop pretending sometime after nine?
This is real life, shit gets physical
Pixar, gangster niggas I find pitiful
Trying to back the rep you create is just criminal
Stop lying, flatline, digital sales minimal
Defibrillators for your career, no one's feeling you
A hundred cc's of truth in your life is critical


Listen: maybe Sade can tell you how love rock
Play it in the liquor stores or in the drug spots
We all want love, but tell me what's love got
We'll love you till it changes who you are, then love stops
We love Mike, we love Elvis, we love Pac
If that's love, nigga, maybe we should all love not
Paparazzi love got us fiending for love shots
Trying to fill a void, just a hole where love rots
Maybe it's a phase, may it be a chapter
Just another story you can think on with laughter
So either leave or come American disaster
Behind all the Maybelline, drywall, and plaster
Under the million dollar rug swept ashes
And billion dollar lives that make debts from assets
The fastest can't run from who they are
I'd run from self but no man can run that far",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-to-be-for-real-lyrics

Full to the gills like a hooked up six piece
With a biscuit, on the spot like a fresh toupee
For sunshine on a fresh blue day
Gents breaking out they fresh new jays to match hats
Ladies with their best doo laid and relaxed
Like, the children skippin rope, double dutch chantin
Miss Mary Mack dressed in black, hands clappin
Sweet Cadillacs with their backs sub slappin
Puppy love couples cuddled with their clothes matchin
Cops passin, harass and tail ya
Sometimes pull ya ass over just to tell ya

Our failures, amongst the rose and azalea
Y'all congregating like Martin King in Selma
Just trying to have a good time like James or Thelma
My cousin bangin 'Pac, my mama singin Mahalia
Feels good today, all the hood's dismay
Is outshined by what coming together could equate
Through my locs, see my Kynfolk that stood with me
Dayton's spokes, crown on leather and wood display
My queens dressed for impression, that's God sendin blessin
Hot like the West End, Icebox on the FM
We need this, more than Playboy needs Hef and
More than your lungs need breaths of

Fresh air, what a day at the park
Fresh air, what a day at the park
Fresh air

Yo, it's getting cool but the coal's still red
Stripes and Patron on chill, my folks all fed
Ladies, what it do? Fellas, what it is?
Oughta have a blue carpet for the A's on the list
Got the bootleggers tryin to appraise me some shit
Like twenty dollars can put sunrays on my wrist
And fa sho', as hot sauce stays on my fish
On the ladies, playas gamin like live on 'em
DJ on the mic got the slide goin
Soul Train line moves like The Glide throwin
On the slow songs, grind, put pine in the ozone
Find something fine to poke on

As the sun puts locs on, light is no mystery
Hickory smokes gone off the rotisserie
Physically grabbin all off in my nose cavity
Tiffany strut as her booty oppose gravity
How do I get her without her cold slappin me?
Have to be late in the park parkin lot
Where trunks knock a lot and weed spark a lot
In humidity scorchin hot, will beef cook or rot?
Summer breeze in need like Benji's and Jackson's
Instead pennies are stackin, coppers reactin
To how peoples relaxin in orderly fashion
If you holdin the rock, then you ought to be passin
Cause they ain't playin, got a cell you can stay in

Get Bramstoked off coke and fight day
Rope-a-dope till night falls then ice faith

Feel it move when everbody's feet stomp
This shit can move mountains we can make the surf break
Make the earth shake, till the earth quakes

Streets hide teeth under Gumbottom'd feet
Washed up dreams flood the drains underneath
Over caine niggas slain laying under wreath
From belly of a mother to the belly of a beast
Feast, let the jury say amen
12 at the table like christ came in
Released when hell has ice yea thin
And Satan takes forsaken souls ice skatin'
Little ghetto boys on the block waitin
For the same fuckers cuffin em to bring the weight in
Inflate prison rates cuz the state raised them

All I ask is you remember me
We so scared to face our history
How will we replace that energy

Hip-Hop is immortal
It's survived many attacks and many wars using, our minds eyes to portal
Folding the spaces between generations and races
So that we can come closer through the struggle
It's easy to move muscle, bone, skin and sinew
Movement of the mind is the type grind I'm into
So I kick the mental over sick instrumentals
Get respect with the pencil, never flex with the stencil
I'm in love with the artform that still keeps my heart warm
Presented with the most virtuous intent but in a hard form
They say Hip-Hop is dead, assassinated by niggas
But on the charts I read, all the hits was by niggas
There's no surrealer drama, they wanna steal her from ya
Take her out to a field in the woods but we ain't gonna let 'em kill the hood
Can't kill it with the pistol, can't beat it with ya chain
Can't crush it with your rims, but you can save it with your pain
As long as we breathe, Hip-Hop gonna breathe with us
As long as we real, folk can't help but feel us
The White Manifest Destiny got 'em they dirty land
But no matter how clean they shave, they got them dirty hands

In the passage of my people they tried to murder all my cousins

Monkey stuff, focusing on the wrong,
 worry I might be long
Cause girlie, she was a walking song
Behind that Revlon, beautiful skin
A niggas breath gone, touching it when chillin
Amongst spirits in her bedroom
She think I think she crazy like she maybe she flying on red brooms
No miss lady, you got a baby now it’s all gravy
Things about your past, though they left you in slavery
Can she escape? and be emancipated
Harnessed to random hatred thats made her this crowds favorite
Is she too long gone to a world that’s foul flagrant?
It can’t be cuz that’s one hell of a smile, ain't it?
Nice pearls under trimmed eyebrows, couldn’t share with the class we was a side crowd
I wish she knew she was beautiful now
Her vanity mirrors her fears as tears waterfall down
And as the Niagara grabs her, shortly after you can capture her madness laughter
Pretty as the sky birds have mastered
Pretty as her for sure, as her makeup mask up
Beauty already now that is there on a pasture(like black beauty, the horse?) ya’ll hush
I think im’a bout to ask her, what’s the rush?

What’s the rush? x3
What's the rush miss lady?
Come on miss lady
Miss lady x4

She’s a drama queen, just turned legal thinking she’s not a teen
Exploring the party scene, not quite allowed to drink
But she does, and you see her when it’s ‘ladies night,’ the crazy type
Looking for a man to have a baby by
What’s the rush? You can’t even drink but you drunk
So if you get pregnant, where’s the trust?
If he got you drunk illegally
Miss lady, think if that’s the way that you want your seeds to be
Sad and mistreated, she.. won’t listen
Ignoring both questions
Accepting drinks from men expecting affection
Miss lady wants a baby but ain’t ready for the pain involved
You can tell by the TP in her training bra
Life ain’t easy but she made it hard
Sleazy
 
and her face is all powdered up like the people at her favorite bar
Bearin’ innocence, if she leaves now she’ll take it all
With her if she stays it’ll wither til the shape is off balance
Like her relationship with her parents
They should have loved her and helped her reach her talents
But they didn’t, they made her feel like she was forbidden to do anything
So she thought about everything and did it
Or tried to, not realizing that she was lied to
Miss lady you’re a stranger to the person inside you
And so am I, but that’s not an invitation to pucker up
Has anybody ever asked you, what’s the rush?",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-miss-lady-lyrics

I just seen you with him
I seen you with him
I seen you with her
I seen you with her
I seen you with them
I seen you with... with everybody
C'mon... stop frontin' like you ain't

Dirty chick, been in thirty dirty flicks
Thirty-six, you woulda hit it if you seen her curves and hips
Had a machine that shocked her nipples, the pain tickled
And had a candle she wanted to burn me with, I'm not into that
I'm not saying I ain't into rack
I'm weird too, I like to fuck in my socks and winter hat
Her bedroom walls were pink, her lamps were dildos
Huge panties as a sheet and had tampon pillows
Waterbed a vagina so it's always wet
A vibrator installed to shake during sex
Sadomasochist: leather whips, bats with spikes
Enjoyed beating, neighbors thought she was a battered wife
We slept and then I said what you waking me for?
Her daughter's birthday it's too late to go to the store
It's her daughter so I assumed she was sorry
When she dumped out my sperm and used the condoms as balloons for the party
She's dirtay

Sellin' pussy out on the ave
Always in the clinic talkin bout ""put it on my tab""
Now she's in my grill piece son
Askin' if I need some
Blabbering about a threesome
She got a light skin friend look like Betty White
Got a dark skin friend look like Wesley Snipes
Sequin suit, having press Lee tight
With that funk in her cunt that you could cut with a machete knife
They'd never trap me
Not even pretending they was three Christina Aggie's
And fuck them through plastic baggies, nasty fatties
I clown hoes
If you pussy ain't got a rash why your clit look like a clown nose?
With no standards in mind
She'll hook an ugly dude up with brain faster than Dr. Frankenstein
No doubt the vilest chicken
You'll need long division in countin' the 69's that she's been in
:
Somehow it's become dirty
And you never dreamed it would go this far
You thought you could quit anytime you wanted to
With tremendous desires but get the beat up on you
Somehow it's become dirty
And you never dreamed it would go this far
You thought you could quit anytime you wanted to
With tremendous desires

But you could get a taste freebie like market's and grapes
She got Rakishi finisher she'll throw her ass in your face
Disgrace, cause she look so gorgeous, a model
More hands than rub on it at the log at Apollo
Baby got some big ticks, kids mad since the day out
The baby got bit by a crab on the way out
Fad that got played out
I don't wanna touch what they do
But only your ass... that's all your mama gave you?
You act wrong I had did knock her boots
Hats stacked on like cats in Dr. Suess
Don't do what donnie don't does claims my view
And that's a trick stunt David Blaine wouldn't do
I bid her adieu, I'm no longer hittin' her shoe
Now I'm pissin like you when I'm finished with brew
Her inners is huge, they popped her with bottles of pop
Mad niggas hiding from cops hide in her twat
She's Dirtay

Dirty indeed
Shirley had a dirty disease
Caught herpes and fleas
They'd jump on your shirt from her jeans
Plus a Chihuahua and Pit she'd kiss on the lips
And let them eat jizz off her tits
And grits off her clit
Shit was a trip
I don't mean to diss cause I hit
While I positioned her lips on a box of chicken strips
She chomps on Twizzler sticks
Pretty face but she's grimy
With a food fetish that's why she weighs 390
Super-sized freak at McDonald's she flirts
Into bestiality, her chihuahua get's hurt
Unless you wanna get burnt
I suggest you don't
She's even thrown ass at the whole cast of Best In Show
Her favorite position was doggy style I told her to pose
But when I pulled out a hot dog fell on my toes
I said HOLD UP! (Wait a minute)
If you see, oh Unique Shirly leave early she's dirty",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-dirtay-lyrics

To smoke away all of you reptilian snakes and alligators
That may be trying to tackle me so that you could shackle me
Separate me from my faculty and get some cash from me but
Actually, around the corner comes reality
So when what goes up comes down, don't blame it on gravity cause
Humans have the ability to create
But most of 'em just take. It's so easy to hate
What would you rather be, a virus to the Earth or a blessing?
Speaking of the Earth, let me light some of its essence
Cannabis sativa and ginseng open my third eye
So I could see things from a better view like, bird's eye
When I think my words rhyme. When I spit, germs fly
When I speak I say things deeper than where worms lie
So please listen. If you missed it, play it twice
It's time for people to start changing their way of life
Live for the future. I know it's your prerogative
But when you just live for the past, you become a part of it
So don't live in it, learn from it
Don't cut down a tree, plant one and burn from it
It hurts my stomach when I see the state the Earth is in
And if you agree
Play this for one of your peeps and blaze one to the beat

I've got some trees and I'm ready to smoke
But when I smoke I think of things that I normally don't
But it's dope because uh
This is part of the Earth's essence anyway
So if the Earth could speak
This is what it would say
(x2)

Try to imagine me
Spinning perfectly in the galaxy
Rotating on its axis with perfect gravity
Perfect orbits traveling forward automatically
I give you energy for batteries
You give me casualties
I give you gasoline, fuel, and food
You give me tragedy
If I could possess a human I'd ask him to rap for me
Have him spread the word that Mother Nature's more than fantasy
And if you turn on her she'll turn you to bow to your hands and knees
I mean, I give you trees, water, and air
It's like people forgot how to share what's already there
Now I gotta be shiesty with what I once used to give for free
Like the benefit of the doubt for the things you did to me
Someone's stealing my resources and getting paid for them!
Someone's committing murders and getting away with them!
More people are taking lives than people are saving them!
If you know to love your brother why are you betraying him??
More people are afraid of him and I ain't blaming them
Cause nowadays he'll strike you with dosages of titanium
You used to hate on him as if you were ashamed of him
And woulda traded him
And guess what. I relate with him
When he breathes my essence I conversate with him
Then I teach him lessons and contemplate with him
It took violence to pull together USA again
What's it gonna take to pull the world together? Aliens
Attacking or maybe even meteorites
To make us understand that it's not US that we need to fight
Whoa...
The Earth just possessed me to read and write
That verse
I need a light
And I'ma be alright

Cause I've got trees and I'm ready to smoke
But when I smoke I think of things that I normally don't
But it's dope because uh
This is part of the Earth's essence anyway
So if the Earth could speak
This is what it would say

The Distance,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Tonedeff)
And he travelled (Repeated)
And he travelled far (Repeated)
I can feel the distance (Repeated)

The streets kept coming and coming and coming? through his tracks
And every scene he spied was all the same
He kept running and running and running and never looked back
He never realised how far he came
And it didn't matter that the latter part hadn't bothered him
Rather all the sadness that followed him as if it was a ball and chain
It was a long await, his posture had changed fraught with his fault and his anger
Until he wouldn't respond when they called his name
It was all part of the game, it started as a play to get ends
It left him with the breath of debt and less friends
And yet he never questioned where the quest went
And when dissenters didn't deem him special
He did his best to impress them and this led to regrets then
Still he was dead-set on success and distress
He only expressed through a sent text
Addressed to anyone he hadn't met yet
The tires peeled on desire's wheels
Again he said, ""I can feel.""

The distance

The city had changed him as he reflected on the decade that passed
His life, he reckoned at last, was a staged pun
With a fantasy masked where the grave was dug
A double life revamped and the other side bites till it tastes blood
So he drives to escape driving a stake through his great love
Incessantly trying to shine through the bars like a caged sun
Dissecting a piece of the strange run
With the dirty southern niggers working for crumbs
In some underground dank club
Where there's nothing but strained hugs from mother and father
And a strange son cause he can't recall when he became one
Though the shame is heavy and weighs tons
He still finds a way to place blame on what they've done
Visits they've stayed away from
And perhaps it was that all along so he just carries on
And he can barely call because the talks are rarely calm
He wears his calluses like a tux to a daily prom
Wearily feeling forever young until they play the song
And his patient wife waits gracefully while he breaks the dawn
Racing across the States to raise the stakes and cost to pay it off
Debating cons of procreation on the hopes to trade it off
A basic honest home relations, how'd they know it would take this long?
But he placed his honour in the way he crawled
All that means is he hits the floor harder from farther up in case he falls
He's racing towards the exit so disconnected
He felt compelled to misdirect his perspective
I can feel

And the more that I stand still
The closer I get still",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-the-distance-lyrics
It’s Over,"Sloppy Seconds, Vol. 2",2005.0,"What did you say?

I shoulda known you could never be true to a soldier
Wastin' all of my time waitin' for you to be sober
Sick of walkin' around with a chip on my shoulder
So you consider the black book, checking my folder
(All lines repeated)

Stay focused and rap quick
Splitted and 
That's what I'm telling myself rippin' and runnin' all over tracks
With the bitches and the hoes distracting
And for that simple fact they could be no attachment
Solo in the bottle, I don't even know what's happening
Hope I don't accidentally show my passion
For this chick in particular, when she strollin' past ya
Making ya motivate to approach and ask her
How she doing, what's her name, who she came to see
But you didn't realize that she came with me
It's hard to conceal eyes, and the game is wicked
Me and you kick it even though we ain't together, so explain it better
I'm feelin' hella confused hearin' the same old shit
Put yourself in my shoes, they don't fit
I know there could be two sides to the story
But give me some credit, checkin' is useless for me


See ya car parked out front, and it don't mean shit
Leave the bar hardly crunk, but on some scheme shit
I need to find out what the hell is really going on
And where ya creeping when ya tellin' me ya goin' home
And so I continue to bend them corners
Never intended on drinking ten Coronas
So I'm swervin' all up on the curb
Where there's some punk dude  my girl
Slurred speech so I stutter my words
Third week of this third shift stalker shit
Private numbers and talkin' shit
Like the  we need a resolution
Cause I'mma hold you down forever, whether it's him or me you choosin'
I'm with you 'til infinity, we cruisin'
Ridin' shotgun, blowin' shotguns, and leanin' and groovin'
And you know how we doin' when it's one on one
Have a little fun in the sun, twisted, bumpin' that twista
I remember you when I hear these songs

Second's the hungry hustlers who work hard and grind
Women with Hollywood dreams who thirst for they time
They see a baller and they be the first ones in line
That's Cali for ya, like my cousin Golden say
Where fly women and fly rides is always on display
Get it poppin' dog, you know what we say
People here to strike it rich so we call it the Golden State
But as fools go, sometimes, man be hesitant
From mountains to the shorelines, all my Cali residents
Are not to be slept on, gang signs repped hard
Lights cops carry guns that'll pierce Teflon
From 6-2-6 to the 8-0-5
To the bay where the houses is stacked in the hillside, it's live
Whenever I bust, I hold pride

C-A-L-I
So high that I touch the sky
Gonna put my faith in you
'Til the day that I say goodbye
C-A-L-I
Ain't never gonna say goodbye
Want to put my faith in you
'Til the day that I die and touch the sky

Straight outta Cali, birthplace of the gang culture
Where devils and angels stay on the same shoulder
And you gotta get high just to stay sober
Tomorrow's another name for a hangover
And cops find ways to hurt you
But hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue
When the light fades the nice face'll hurt you
Everywhere the grounds round, sky shades of purple
A beautiful night, the sight of the sunset
The gift and price of environments unkept
They say that pioneers come west
But this where we from, now we the only ones left
Unicas personas que ayudan con la unidad
Y nunca dan basura a ninguna de la publica

Encontrando toda la locura y la usura

Mixed together with the Golden State
Fo sho  rest of my days
If you ain't know, it's that dirty south
Mixed together with the Golden State

Now everybody wanna holla 'bout the west is back
But the left coast never really left, in fact
Just relax, I'll take you to the dock of the bay
Knockin' Pac and some Dre
Swervin' down the block in L.A
Cause I spit so deadly
And it hit so heavy
To ya face like the bass from a 64 Chevy
Cruisin' down the street with my grip so steady
On the wheel, if I try to turn my wrist won't let me
Ready, go, it's tob and yours truly
Scary how we got the west craven like a horror movie
Reppin' Cali to the end, that's my sworn duty
Turn the volume hella high and let the music pour through me

Stayin' faithful to them warm California days

And I've had my last dance with you
Onto the empty streets we go

The World Is A Geto like them Boys said
K.Y. cats die behind thoroughbreds
Get dangled off a narrow ledge
Or get your top pushed back like you give Pez
You bet Tryin' To Get Free like you dead prez
When you found, bound by your hands and legs
Behind currency
Declaring an emergency for euros, pesos, ? and francs
Little Arab cats buggin' throwin' rocks at a tank
A little Swiss Miss with big tits will lace up your drank
With the same shit they gave Jason Statham in Crank
Little Germans just a mack 10 at carryin' shanks
I guess shit don't change except the range of the weapon
If you walk timid, better change how you're steppin'
The pavements a slave ship with chains and whips
If you wanna keep either better close your lips and knees

You a weak dude
Limp wristed, bright colors
You a sweet dude, ex crack dealer who make money through rap

In the streets of NY, you and your friends die
Send my, street niggas to murder and lynch guys
I'm a Brownsville nigga for real

You a clown still gettin' a deal

Beat Street, Beat Street, street fighter
On Wall Street in a Street Car Called Desire
21 Jumpstreet, run up on Street Kings

Soon as the sun set the god light up the haze

Enemies With Benefits F. Tonedeff,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

She the girl of my dreams, also my nightmares
Cus she be killin it, jigglin' in her nightwear
Between mean glances that we might share
The space between us is like a lightyear
All in my phone like she AT&T
All in my Facebook pretendin she me
Cus her ""Not Hot"" single friends feedin her nonsense
The ghetto's trying to kill me and my chick's an accomplice
With black gloves (black gloves) black mask (black mask)
Full lips (full lips) fat ass (I like that!)
Text messaging ridiculous comments
I'd have to wash my mouth out to read you the contents
She might literally love me to death
We had a stairway to heaven til' I fell down the steps
Now I'm left with a pain in the neck
But she's my eye candy, the flavor I savor
And I'm part Vader, I think with my saber
I live in crazy town and I'm married to the mayor


They call me Lex, junior
Not Rex Lewis
My ex like a six shot shooter - sex ruger
She's a sex cougar
She texts we bang everytime I sit next to her
Man, she get me hard as steel, I call her X-Ray
Plus my ex bust her neck during sex play
I get the cleanest dome, I mean it holmes
She never be at home but she never be alone
Her boyfriend is a punk, he rock a onesie
He think he fly, pullin' stunts in his undies
But she my kryptonite
I know... cryptic right?
I'm sitting back with a pipe getting ripped at night
On my window pane, the coldest rain
My enemy, Miss Lois Lane


She's a devil in a baby blue dress
Who I'm mentally redressing as an angel through sex
Who be testing my mettle - and yes, in a way, I choose the stress
And I guess that I settle cause I'm a slave to huge breasts - But it
Ain't worth it
Ask me again if my mind has changed on the situation in five days
And I couldn't say for certain
And so we stay in this deranged arrangement
Nailing 'tween the breaks of these unwavering debates of 'who's the
Crazy person'?
She got them fuck-goggles on me
My judgement Impaired like I was drunk on kamakazi's riding a busted Kawasaki
Callin the love doctor cause I need a fix of this chick and it's sickening
Wish I could quit, but my dick is mixing the signals and shit
Half of the time, I see past all these disastrous signs
And half of the time, I keep asking if I'm happy to lie
If blame can be assigned, then I guess I'll have to try this food for thought:
You can always see the shape of the pan in the pie
Savage desire in me to taste her loving/
So my piece of the mind will never turn into a baker's dozen

Now, you know, she's a grown woman

Start thinking...

Well it was one of those days with not much to do
My homegirl hits me on my cell and tells me to come through
Let me get dressed, it ain’t no thing but just
Make sure you got papers, she says just bring dutches
I’m like cool
I know the deal cause shorty don’t roll
And it’s been that way since we was 14 years old
But we’ve matured and stayed close, and she lookin’ so sweet
Caramel, booty’s well, relaxed hair with gold streaks
We ain’t never been intimate, just kept things innocent
Chillin’ with her over the years made the friendship get stronger
But now I’m slippin’ with the sentimental shit
Feelin’ different, and thinkin’ ’bout hittin’ it
But I’m dismissin’ it, I prefer that we last
’Cause she’s more than breaking case of emergency ass
But she’s got me yearnin’ the ass, for turn that we smash
But I gotta chill and just learn to relax

Shorty I'm there for you any time you need me (x3)

We know a lot about each other, our relationship was truly
One of those that you would have that that she was married to me
Calls me things like her sugarbear, honeybun, and booby
Even lays across me on the couch when we watch a movie
And it’s gotten to me, but I wanna resist it
But she’s so juicy I just wanna slop her up with a biscuit
And it’s hard ’cause when we chill I don’t want her to sense it
’Cause I know if I say something it’s gon’ fuck with the friendship
I just wish she wasn’t so touchy cause it would be so lovely
If she was more than my smoke buddy
But I ain’t thought about her givin’ it up
She talks about the guys she likes, and I tell her ‘bout the chicks that I fuck
But that’s what we on, sharin’ a smirk at that Usher song (shorty!)
It’s cool girl, we can do it your way
’Cause you a friend girl, I can do this all day


There’s been a thousand nights when we was close to makin’ love
Every girl I dates a ho and every dude she dates a scrub
But it’s somethin’ steady, everybody that knows her says like
“Damn y’all, when y’all gon’ fuck already”
Laugh, play it off like she’s just another floozie
She like, ""that nigga Pro? He like a brother to me""
And that’s the kiss of death ’cause it’s means that she just
Really a friend thing with no hopes of gettin’ sex
And it’s sets me in a world when, has my brain’s twirlin’
’Cause at home she walks around like I’m one of her girlfriends
T-shirts and panties, had me lookin’ at her back
But she peeps, and I don’t want to look at her like that
So, for now, I appreciate the place we at
’Cause in the end run it makes me laugh the way she has
Me fiendin’ for a chance to break that ass
But we just friends and that ain’t too bad",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-friendgirl-lyrics

Stars Shine Brightest (In The Darkest Of Night) f. Rick Warren,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You can only see the stars when it’s Don Cheadle black
When the chips are down who dips and who reacts?
Folding under pressure ain’t get us to where we at
When all hope’s lost you battle to get it back
In fact, dark times are when heroes shine
Without them sour grapes there would be no wine
Let your ego dine, adversity for breakfast
Zero pride, in settling for less then
Fighting tooth and nail, no matter who prevails
Instead of wishing on a star grab a comet by the tail
Your ship ain’t coming in, then you got to make a sale
Catch the wind and make it sail and hit the ground runnin’
Til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin’
Those talking ‘bout failure ain’t talkin’ ‘bout nothin’
You may weather the storm if you don’t stop punchin’
Reach for the stars and you might just touch ‘em

Stars shine, stars shine
When you think you’ve lost your way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day
Stars shine, stars shine
Coming out to light the way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day

Our money’s funny, our change is strange
These days ain’t sunny and the sea ain’t tame
We playing games where the rules ain’t clearly defined
In this coffee black world, knee deep in the grind
Be a vine in the shade, a salmon in a stream
Try lookin’ for the stars when examining your dreams
Could go from street singers to pop figures
From block niggas to a brotha that is followin’ stock tickers
To grow in the night you gotta create light
Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight
No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam
And you don’t need a telescope to detect dream
You blessed with a mind that can see through space
On dark nights, in the stars you can find your face
Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light, light

Against all odds and against the grain
Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain
In monsoon proportions them moments of importance
When victory’s in vain it’s the same the blood coursin
Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment
Poised when them black clouds come ‘round don’t back down
Let haters be theme music playin’ in the background",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-stars-shine-brightest-in-the-darkest-of-night-f-rick-warren-lyrics

Pushers playin' while police man up with snitchers and narcs
Could cheddar be so vital a piece of my soul's survival
To the point to even go look for peace you load your rifle?
Past mistakes, court dates, brand you for life
Force hand makes the crackheads scramble for pipes
Fast grands, take your high stakes, gamble for ice
Look at the surface of the game, dang, that'll be nice
Figured the purpose of the game, man, that'll be life

Come a little closer into the life of a smoker
Where paranoia is the price to be sober,
 
over my shoulder
Seems to be the land of the lost and the home of the slaves
Where soldiers carry toasters in holsters, supposed to be brave
But underneath the surface they purpose is lost in they ways
They walk in a daze, the only time they spark when they blaze
They off in a maze, the high life you've lost to get paid
The low life is when you're tossed in that cage, or in that grave
So I stay with an open mind, my mind's open
When I'm totin' 9s on the grind hopin' over time
I can climb to the top of the cliff
'Cause right now I'm standin' at the edge stiff, I'm hopin' that I don't slip
One slight, false move and my life in this tight grip
The lose all strength in the time and be priceless
Though my right fist is stuck in the air to show power
My left hand's holdin' them grams of snow powder

Bangs they all round, bangs on her hair
Yessir, her right there, she livin' the nightmare
In the couch room bounce a tip with curtains closed
Supposed to dance but off the deck some piles a sniff she workin' poles
Slice of onion make her cry
'Cause of lack of funding standards are lowered like dungeons only to survive
For many life ain't half over at the end of its rope
Like they just smoked bad dope blended with soap paint
But were getting paid however we can

Leaders misleadin' and weavin' rivals for fraud

Spark My Soul (feat. Inverse & Substantial),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Walking through the April showers
Through the broken glass and the changing flowers
It seems like the rain is pounding harder
When those who have no way to get out of it
But every face in the crowd
Has burdens that chase and been weighing them down
Tryin' to find their place and how to stay safe
When that place just ain't been allowed
The uncertainty, anger and doubt
Are the violence that makes it unsafe in their town
Some deal with the pain that devours
Those that don't stay that straight for power
The only thing that stays the same is change
But we too afraid to break from now
Our parents had their day
But now it's our kids that we need to be making proud

Let the music be the fuse that will spark my soul
Let the music be the fuse that will spark my soul
Let the music be the fuse that will spark my soul
My soul, my soul, my soul, my soul...
As I flip the first page on the calendar year
Be right back with another one to bang on your ear
Got the hustle and the drive and the talent is clear
But, see the challenge is to balance it and manage to steer
Through the potholes and the obstacles
On these moonlit streets where the cops patrole
Got a little bit of knowledge, but there's lots to know
I was cruising for a minute, but I lost control
Had to ease back, take my foot of the gas
Uncover all the pain that I had put in the past
Re-answer all the questions that I shouldn't have asked
And come to terms with the lessons that I couldn't have grasped
When I was much younger, dedication plus hunger
Took us not to the very top, but just under
Now we just trying to break the ceiling

Wishing I knew the peace that she does, its sorta deep
At the same time her great grandma is being buried
Some day she'll be burying me, sorta scary
Ordinarily wouldn't really be on my mind
But the fact I made it over 20 is divine
So I welcome every challenge that comes
As experience, wisdom is the sum
So if I sound a little older than I am
It's because this wicked world forced me to be a man
Really can't say I wish I was still a teen
Kinda like being trapped in the guillotine
It seems everyone wanted to take my head
Instead of building like brothers, breakin' bread
And it became therapy to write on the page
Even as youth departs and I'm comin' of age
It sparks my

Let the music be the fuse that will spark my soul
Let the music be the fuse that will spark my soul

If she'll take me

She got me chasing dreams, shoe strings tied together
While niggas flaunt her for quarters, don't want her but need the cheddar
But I can't fall playa for her, letting him slay her
While this broad out in a brawl in more houses than prayer
Yearning for affection, but burning with no protection
Cause every bit of bread I make I'm earning for bill collection
Instead of pitching in she switching men, but come back to me
Cause she know when I freak her the speakers'll come factory
Lost jobs, behind time spent on love
These chicks didn't mix with  men, hard love
Got me flaming trees, cough and I name them trees
Speaking on past relations that became emcees
But financially, I lack the Jack to tame them needs
There's other fish in them, but I ain't trying to sell them seeds
I ain't no fisherman, just out looking to poll please
But a man only stand so much begging on both knees


I said I give this bitch my time, dedicate my grind to her
Offering my best sweat, bent all these lines  her
This bitch a dime, and she know it hard to get chicks
Bills, but plays tricks, plus cars they get slicks
Sliding past like opportunity, I try to catch them
But I'm using both hands to hold up my world
Riding fast is consuming me, I'd die to fetch her
Boy I ain't a man if I don't marry this girl
The swirl of joy and pain, sunshine and rain
Feeling like a player missing open layups in the game
Is it a shame to sacrifice my logic over pussy?
Been trying to help Common save this ho since I's a rookie
It's feeling like a lost cause, all y'all got her on some bullshit
That  nappy roots, I'm like aw naw
But I want her to stay because I love how we lay

What They Playin? (Blow My High),"Sloppy Seconds, Vol. 2",2005.0,"I'm so high in the sky-high-high-high
I don't know and I just don't care for what they're playin'(x2)

Just chief the roach blunt fresh out the nest tryna relax
When I walk in see the DJ siftin' through wax
Take off the Walkman, jump in Snoop's early years
Elevated, appreciating what all these girlies wear
Don't touch I remind self as it happened
Man I wish I had paid actors for re-enactment
My beautiful sky he dropped grey skies on it
And you miss and sigh(?) i call it a high moment
Cause the dj, he play the same lame song for the 5th damn time
Wax that you couldn't sell on eBay
Tried to pull a chick outside, guess what she say
""That's my song playin'"" with a pea brain
Well while y'all dance in inebriated trance imma hit the parkin' lot and try to come up on an amp
Cause imma be damned if I party with zombies
Back to my Walkman and the bitch that always calms me, smoke

I'm so high in the sky-high-high-high
I don't know and I just don't care for what they're playin'(x2)

Well my fifths mean, kicks clean, herbs in my jeans
High as my pop and his pop, so birds in my genes
And fly since strictly hip hop(?), no words in between
So I walk in, get change
Just caught the shift change
From DJ whats his name to DJ sedative time
Who turned the cloud I sat on into a negative 9
Blendin' retro with techno, on top of a lets go echo
While chicks lick their lips at me but won't show me they breasts though
My buds in a street fight, with stray cats and a soundtrack and i'm losin'
I slumber the racks on the back of a twotip that I'm usin'(?)
While I watch these cop-connoisseurs confuse it with music
Get drunk hit the dance floor and abuse it
Just to think I, paid to get baked today
Then in an odd way paid these fuckers to take it away
Now, fuck it i'm out so, that's okay
Like the half assed blunt I got stashed in the back of my ashtray
Feel me? (bitch)

I'm so high in the sky-high-high-high

Looking Back F. Anna Wise,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
Part of my shine comes from the distance
You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
Is this business emotionally invested?
Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
Love is war, sex is a weapon
The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'
Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene
To make x-rated into nc-17
Then see everything she got she not shy
Our love below so dro we most high
Then wears off when what we wear's on
Again I turn away when what we share's gone
So...
If this is not the hardest part
I wanna part
Before it gets too deep
If passion dies within routine
I'll come clean
Leave me be, baby
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Looking Back
Under the twilight, and we living the Miller Highlife
La Petite Mort, my lady we bout to die twice
I won't' surrender and you won't surrender yurn
Whatever happens after this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
We wired for desire, dangers to ourselves
Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
My muse, sleeps deep within time
I go to her for credit though I need to decline
It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
I'm sorry it's just the way we designed
My dear we should leave here, I'm talking bout one at a time though
Cause you got me changin' my mind slow
Leave here, says that voice in the back of my spine
As I awake and the moment rewinds",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-looking-back-f-anna-wise-lyrics

 was on her knees
Watch her eyes, she looks so happy
See her smile
Oh I know it's not for me
Wheelchair groupie, oh, wheelchair groupie
She moved her chair up to the stage
Her Hasselblad was on her knees
She moved her chair up to the stage
Her Hasselblad was on her knees

This is some true shit
You won't ever believe it but you gon believe it
Because I'm gonna paint it for you
The show's packed like immigrants in project tenements
 detect the remnants  for ligaments
I glance in the stage at my drunk, screamin' folks
My eyes drop, but  20 
With a dame on top, with her name on the top
And she cruisin' the underground with her game on cock
I'mma walk to her, talk to her cause I'm high and neg'lint
The thought of a paraplegic groupie is quite unsettlin'
But she made an ass out of me and 'umption
When she told me she broke three bones stage jumpin'
At her own show cause her own flow was quite the shit
I blazed her, she blazed me, we swapped and spit
And it gets greater later when the herbs in her lungs
I was , inebriated, with burns on my tongue
Session burned, lesson learned, with resin on my thumbs
Sometimes the future can have you in the present looking dumb

She needs love
Oh, oh, oh

Fresh in my locs like Cube in the early 90s
I step off stage, eyes set on this girlies' hiney
I tap her on the shoulder, she turn around, smile growin'
Told her she gonna be fine long as the Nile flowin'
She said I like how you had the crowd glowin', you be rippin'
While glarin' at my sun shades, askin' if they prescription
You blind? She asked freely like I get it lots
Nah cause, baby, you got back
She like I love Sir Mix-a-lot, , Heavy D, Notorious B.I.G
I'd give up my kids for chances at porkin' them pigs
Damn that's deep (crazy) told me I wasn't her type, like
Too much on me was right, I couldn't put up a fight, Ike
She was fine as Tina, couldn't turn her mind though
Never seen such an ignorant fetish out a fine hoe

He in the church, in the jails, on the beach
It ain’t a place that ain’t touch these feets
He’s the living word that is preached

He is so raw, he don’t need to be seen
He so raw he don’t need you and me on his team
Responsible for nightmares and dreams
He’s the winning lottery ticket that made you scream
He cam quiet any raging storm and
He’s the reason your eyes popped open this morning
Give him praise with every piece of strength you got
Talking about being successful I’m sorry you not
And God ain’t involved in your little biz
We can’t make no moves till he makes his
He’s the salt and the pepper, we the sheep he the shepherd
Took the crown from Nebuchadnezzar
Carried by God, never left stranded
And death is your free ticket to get off the planet
My father owns all the books
So if you rob me n***a I’m still rich as f**k


He is everywhere, every step of my path is a weapon
For I trust, left us blessed with the craft
And though many times I give less than what’s asked
When tarnished he’s varnish on my brass
My idol, I don’t bow before gold cow
In this cold world he’s my snowplow
He’s my knowhow, rights my wrongs in my iris
Makes sure that my sight is long
No Isis or Osiris, in my crisis, Christ is the shining sun for the lightness
As I write this he puts heart in the lifeless
For the righteous he’s a way out your plight
Just pray, in the hurricane you won’t sway

And screw your broad on top of 2X4's

You with the raps you speaking but my task is easy
I'ma make it cool to use the term ""Wack MC"" again
Rap like me and then I crack your teeth and
Then you'll think twice before biting the crack in the street again
You got jokes but you the wackest comedian
And ain't nobody laughing cause I'm jacking your beat again
But relax with the beef my friend
I ain't dissing nobody, I'm just amping the media
I'm in your girl's car scratching your CD up
With the back of my keys while she practices eating up
My dick
And when she asks me to be with her
I'ma tell her to stop talking, grab the receiver and
Pump, pump, pump, pump, pump me up

Catch you slipping some of my peoples and they cut off

Dude I'm pimping I oughta get some curls
Got the new sounds and we bout to hit the world soon
Boom is the blue
Gone off from green leaves
These Florida trees got we feeling the sea breeze

When I'm drunk I'll settle for three threes at one time

Roll a big fat flamer, peep the track slayer

Coming with clips

Not available for hire cause they strictly tips
Young astrologists niggas, taking up space
Easy Back Oven, niggas bragging 'bout cakes
Reaching for tag of the back of they jean waist
Bluffing to save face, did nothing and gave chase
I'ma go find him the pastor to save Ma$e
Bless him with the truth, undress him for the youth
Stop him from spitting like he got weapons in the booth

When I called on Mary J be my serenity

I'm feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
I'm trying to place but my heart ain't even in the race
I've came far enough that turning' back is time wasted
Imprisoned by fear, I don't need no iron bracelets
What's my fate, how can I escape my heart
Running blind, an open mind could break this dark
A major spark might just make a star in this...
Way under in slumber is my true self shown
A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown
Pane in the windows of a once happy home
I'm a Cheshire Cat laughin' at the caged birds' song
A caterpillar shroomin usin' fumes from my bong
To cloud a land wondering what fuels what is wrong
Lust in my loins, vengeance in my heart
Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
I can't let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
Opinions of my health, my self, and wealth go off the chart
My struggle to keep balance ain't a challenge it's an art
Outside my sleep is silent ‘cause inside the war is fought
Every night, as I fade to the...

But we made it this
And we never gonna stop
Even when we reach the top
Of our dreams

I'm tryna reach the top of my dreams
That's why I'm mapping out the script and slowly plottin' my scenes
They never get the picture, even when they're watchin' that screen
That's why they underestimate me, 'cause I'm not what I seem
I'm quite different - entirely focused on making wise decisions
I'd rather risk a huge mistake than spend my life wishin'
I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
'Cause when you're gone, it's just that coffin that you lie stiff in
Six feet under - makes me wonder
If I could go back in time and try to fix each blunder
That I made when I was younger, way before the hunger
Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number
See, I'm achievin' every part of my goals
And I'ma stay the same, no matter how far that I go
I think bright, even though inside I'm dark and I'm cold

Let the door hit em where the good Lord split ‘em
PS...P players you missing the big picture
Get a million inch screen let your dream be seen
The world is a stage let your dream be scene
Backdrop and props for the finer things
Enjoy the spice of life on your fries and wings
And wash it down with something imported
If domestic ain’t the best at making you feel important
Aim high, poppin’ bottles will get boring
I can have caviar dreams or champagne wishes
Or a catfish sandwich with Champagne the stripper
Its my dream

Claim a victory for entering this world earth
Then play your symphony from city to the rural dirt
Beyond hurt, invert your neural confines
I hit the lines like I'm running in the combine
Intramural of the mind, drink ya night caps
Dream big nigga, play that shit in IMAX
My dream theater's a perpetual climax
Make miracles, give me water I'll give you wine back
For troops in IRAQ, Haitians in the Carib
Or my Arabs, who keep the faith and wear it like a scarab
Dreams prepare ya for living they holdin' key to life
Gotta be the sheriff when you have em try to read em right
Don't be impressed by things that haunt ya when you sleep at night
Just rise above it, right in public, catch an eagle flight
Tap that passion that's within ya and just let it breath
I heard it whisper words of wisdom would ya let it be, please.. let it be

But we made it this
And we never gonna stop

Hard As They Come (Act I) f. Freddie Gibbs,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I’m a monster that don’t reside up under your bed
I’ma march to the beat that I put into your head
Send shots to your liver I deliver you death
You can barter your tomorrow but a martyr you’re left
Get you hot under the collar when my name’s on your breath
Click the starter on your Impala I’ll be there when you wreck
Fuckin’ with me you better keep your feelings in check
Be the life of the party or a lifeless body
Get with me thinkin’ you hard, you’ll be hardly standin’
I’m the hardest of them all, you’re the hardest landin’
Face first in the asphalt, your ass talked
Too wreckless, now you helpless from the rounds you caught
I’ll teach your ass a lesson, outlined in chalk
Have you hostage in the hospice, high and trying to walk
I am bravery in a bottle, I am courage in a glass
I got the government’s approval, prohibition couldn’t last
I go hard

C’mon lets ride out
The whole family over for Christmas dinner
Let’s go through the purses and sell the gifts from your moms house
They know you out here doing dirt for cash
Plus you the one unemployed, a couple dollars ain’t gon hurt they ass
I’m the only friend you got
You tried to sell me but you took a hit and eventually you just couldn’t stop
A couple of sniffs would get you lit but couldn’t get you to the top
Oh what an event when you got hip to cookin’ me into them rocks
I had you locked, you know it costs to come and see me
So fuck yo groceries, fuck yo bills, go on and pawn that TV
And fuck yo life, just catch this beam and take it straight to the dome
And fuck yo kids, the state’ll seperate em’ and place em’ in homes
It’s gon be cool, I know I got you crazy subdued
Ever since the 80’s played your whole community for a fool
And the ones that sold me smoke each other over new tennis shoes
They field niggas, I’m the definition of death, the real killa

I’m with the fiends on the block playin shoot em’ up
When I erupt makes it hard to know who to trust
People scared to test me since the 80’s
Anybody can get it, man woman or baby
Shots do not discriminate, impossible to eliminate
I disseminate, you disentigrate
I can come off as a prick, you might get stuck with
I’ll prolly steal your girl if you try and fuck with me
Cus next to me you’re looking quite frail
& if you snitch you’ll be counting your days in white cells
Just needlessly in CB4
Ask the CDC no CD4’s
Cus the truth is I’m on America’s dick
Uncle Sam fucks the poor and it’s making em’ sick
Now their life’s in a Tube, a downward spiral

Hypnopomp (Epilogue) f. Bianca Spriggs,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Life is but a dream
Once, two sons were born to Nyx
Goddess of night and Hypnos, god of sleep
The eldest was Morpheus, who lived in the visions of dreamers
Rising to his calling meant someone must abandon all other paths
For the prospect of greatness
Thus heroes and kings called Morpheus ""the Destiny Bringer;""
To accept his gift required impossible risk
And loneliness in the midst of adoration
But to deny him: madness
Then there was Phobetor whom they called ""the Dread Crawler""
For he dwelled only in nightmares
And fed on the acrid fumes of human fear
A shapeshifter, he appeared as the manifestation of terror
Forcing a choice between the path of uncertainty
And the path of mediocrity
To meet Phobetor's gaze required great courage;
To look away: shame
Only in the grey hour, in the moments of shadow and light
Will the balance of power dangle
Between the Destiny Bringer's favour
And the Dread Crawler's wrath
Only there between waking and sleep
Will we recognize our true path",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-hypnopomp-epilogue-f-bianca-spriggs-lyrics
Sunrise / Sunset (radio),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Life is unusually beautiful
But sometimes I feel so unsuitable and it drowns out what's musical
And then I just find myself drinkin' and thinkin'
Making no turns yet my signal is blinkin'
Feeling bad cause no judge is giving me 10
Breaking rules to get up out of the deep end
On the verge of having trouble begin
Drama never leavin'
Hot! is the weather where I'm from
Hot! is situations that come
Hot! is how people get when
They're stuck in a pit, world not giving a shit
Life is suppose to be beautiful, but it's a crucible
Turning me into a person brutal who's
Psychodependant on, money bitches drugs
Funny business stuff, can I give it up?
Yes I love, to get paid, get laid
Get drunk, get high, but then I hear kids cry
Saying that they need a model to follow
But I still find a liquor bottle to hollow

Sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time
Insecurities tingle racing up my spine
Facing crime in an eye to eye, head to head
Thinking of how to get dough to bread, keep roses red
I realize that my life is composed of
The actions I take combined with the feelings I hold but
Sometimes negativity molds a, heart from it's start is
Just trying to get over
But you can't let it fold tha, soldier
That from it's inception, needn't lucks blessing from clovers
Cause when it fights, it strikes, it slices, it bites
From morning to night, back through darkness to light
It's office is yo life, builds a fortress that's tight
You can call it Christ or whatever you like
But to ignore it is yo right, you deal your will
You reap what you sew, you till your field
But post battle, who will - heal - your shield
So many vices you can sacrifice, kill and grill
Cause you gotta see that the world will confuse you
With abused clues
I flip through news
And see that the world's a treasure chest of misuses jewels
Who can't maintain... from sunrise, to sunset.. they face pain
Their used to blue skies got grey stains
And are surrounded by friends who got snake fangs
But you gotta block it
Don't avoide it, destroy it, throw it up in a box and then lock it
Cut power when docs try to shock it
Cause that ain't the shit you should welcome your block with",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-sunrise-sunset-radio-lyrics
What’ll You Do? (preview),UnKnown,UnKnown,"What'll you do when the people go home
What'll you do when the show is all done

I can't
I won't
I, no

I'm 25 now, year I told my pops I'd toss the towel in
Making music no longer easily makes my smile bend
Though, 'wow's'from the crowd's ain't end yet
Them smiles and back pats still ain't helpin the rent checks
Ain't far from crack packs if I hursh these verses
Flippin words shit for an empty purse feels worthless
Listen, word of mouth done been a blessing and a curse
We reach heads, but the only bread we see's off shirt sales
Tours and shows spread all over the earth, well
Recoup gas and hotels, back to this dirt, Hell's
Far away though, believe I ain't complaining
Rather explaining, that unless this southern rain end
We'll show proof we's as real as you
Needing a roof, some shoes, dollar bills and food
Two from The Dirty met with mismatched skin
Acknowledge first that one day this track may end
When there's no more steam in that engine
Yet hopefully clean streams be an astringent
But needs outweight cheese tryna stay in contention
""For the love"" is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension
""For the love"" is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension
Kno
""For the love"" is a hard reason to keep our lives in suspension, yeah

What'll you do when the people go home
What'll you do when the show is all done
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what'll I do with the leftover wine
What'll you do, lay it down
What'll you do, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down again",https://genius.com/Cunninlynguists-whatll-you-do-preview-lyrics
Sunrise / Sunset (street),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Life is unusually beautiful
But sometimes I feel so unsuitable and it drowns out what's musical
And then I just find myself drinkin' and thinkin'
Making no turns yet my signal is blinkin'
Feeling bad cause no judge is giving me 10
Breaking rules to get up out of the deep end
On the verge of having trouble begin
Drama never leavin'
Hot! is the weather where I'm from
Hot! is situations that come
Hot! is how people get when
They're stuck in a pit, world not giving a shit
Life is suppose to be beautiful, but it's a crucible
Turning me into a person brutal who's
Psychodependant on, money bitches drugs
Funny business stuff, can I give it up?
Yes I love, to get paid, get laid
Get drunk, get high, but then I hear kids cry
Saying that they need a model to follow
But I still find a liquor bottle to hollow

Sitting on the dock of the bay wasting time
Insecurities tingle racing up my spine
Facing crime in an eye to eye, head to head
Thinking of how to get dough to bread, keep roses red
I realize that my life is composed of
The actions I take combined with the feelings I hold but
Sometimes negativity molds a, heart from it's start is
Just trying to get over
But you can't let it fold tha, soldier
That from it's inception, needn't lucks blessing from clovers
Cause when it fights, it strikes, it slices, it bites
From morning to night, back through darkness to light
It's office is yo life, builds a fortress that's tight
You can call it Christ or whatever you like
But to ignore it is yo right, you deal your will
You reap what you sew, you till your field
But post battle, who will - heal - your shield
So many vices you can sacrifice, kill and grill
Cause you gotta see that the world will confuse you
With abused clues
I flip through news
And see that the world's a treasure chest of misuses jewels
Who can't maintain... from sunrise, to sunset.. they face pain
Their used to blue skies got grey stains
And are surrounded by friends who got snake fangs
But you gotta block it
Don't avoide it, destroy it, throw it up in a box and then lock it
Cut power when docs try to shock it
