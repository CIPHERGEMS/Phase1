"Roxanne, Roxanne",UTFO,1983.0,"[Kangol Kid & 
EMD
]
Yo EMD
Yeah, what's up man?
There goes that girl they call Roxanne, she's all stuck up
Why do you say that?
'Cause she wouldn't give a guy like me no rap

Man, she was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
'Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I know ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I was to lose I wouldn't be upset
'Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzol.""
I thought she'd be impressed and give me devious rap
I thought I had her caught inside my sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't committing suicide for no crab
Calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
'Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man, oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
But you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, 'cause my rap's the best
The Educated Rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if we had a baby, we'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Mary, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
She lives in Mt. Airy, 
her father's a fairy
His wife's a secretary, his son's in military
They forced him to enlist, I guess it wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, 
his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January or was it February?
But every time I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You search it all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on my back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

Roxanne, Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne

You thought you had her roped, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So Educated Rapper, huh, bust this
Since she's a new girl around the block
I had to let her know I was the debonair Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak with you if I can
And if I'm correct then your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running 'round the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, to crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got through 'cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare 'cause I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, ophthalmology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orthopedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of your body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but she'd be back by 8
Told me call her at 9 to arrange a date

Did you take her to the beach?

That's what we planned
But she stood me up, Roxanne, Roxanne

Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne, and here's our gameplan

The beat is here, so we will reveal it
And if you think it's soft, then Roxanne feel it!",https://genius.com/Utfo-roxanne-roxanne-lyrics

Diss,Lethal,UnKnown,"No one
Nowhere
Comes close
Suckers
Step off
From Brooklyn ?????
Suckers
Diss!

How dare you tell me in my face that I couldn't rock?
I make the healthiest woman on earth boy just stop
If you say another word to interrupt
I'll jump out these speakers, boy I could fuck you up!
But then again I really shouldn't get involved that deep
When you talk I smell your butt and you just put me to sleep
Thank God I'm only upset, cause if you made me mad
I'd hit you so hard you would have to call me dad
Right here on the spot, bustin you in the knot
Before you know it you'll be screamin, ""He rock''
Was I too fast for ya, wasn't it clear?
The party won't rock unless you get out of here
So take your rat-skin coat and step out the door
Tell your woman stop callin, I don't want her no more
For now slow down, shut up, and then I'll chill
But can't nobody say that I ain't that ill
I'm the rudest of the rude muthafuckas alive
There were six of us left and I shot five
To make a long story short and save my breath
I'm the only one left, and yo, ur def!
When it come to dissin I am the champ
I heard you tried to buy Adidas with your mother's food stamps
Don't know a thing about buyin clothes
Tried to buy Pro-Keds and you got Ked-Pros
Now let me get a little harder
Your mother's pregnant again and I'm the father
And if you think I'm lyin by just a notch
Ask your father, he sat and watched
Diss

Step off with that old riffin, stop playin me close
I'm not a sucker, I got heart and I'm from the East Coast
5'8"" with brown eyes, yo, the girls say I'm cute
But I strap the .45 and I ain't afraid to shoot
I came across brothers who ???bass wasn't blessed???
It phased me none cause I broke ribs and necks
Beat up Jamaicans, Jews, Haitians and Italians
Punched out they tooths and wore them as medaillons
Back in the days we called punks sundullah
When people see Doc, they all hail the ruler
Calvin is cool, but me, I'm much cooler
You riff, you wan get dissed with me, you're not medulla
Cause to be from Brooklyn, yo, that's mandatory
You're from the Island, so get off my territory
I wear black, I never wore purple
If I drew a line where I ruled, you'd walk in a circle
Don't try to play me out, maytag
You better hold my bow and follow my footsteps, fag
Cause this is the Doc with the surgical gas
Dislocate your mouth and you'll be talkin out yo ass
Cause that's what you talk is a bunch of bullshit
While I be cold chillin walkin round with a mitt
I told you when I met you, you know what you can get
Am I upset? Well, just a little bit
I told you before not to get me started
Cause Doctor Ice is gettin cold retarted
After the battle the undertaker will dress you
The good Lord will bless you and the graveyard will rest you
(Last night changed it all)

I'm as real as reality, not a Greek myth
It's time to let you know who you're fuckin with
My rap is magical, stronger than voodoo
Your style, it stinks, you know, like doodoo
You're shiverin and shakin in your Fruit of the Looms
Keep it simple, stupid, you'll be next to the tombs
Of the other victims, I keep their heads on my shelf
If they were resurrected, they'd kill themself
I'll never say excuse me, move out my way, sucker
You use 'mister', I use 'motherfucker'
You thought that E was more well-respected
Now you know, stupid, expect the unexpected
(Yeah)
(Ah hah)
We got the mouth to be the boss, the heart to back it up
Rhymes come naturally, no need to crack it up
But you inflate, make others sick
And my last and final words is: get off my dick!

The Real Roxanne,UTFO,1983,"Yo, Kangol
(Yeah what's up girl?)
I'm the real Roxanne and I'll rock your world
(But you're all stuck up)
Well, you say that
'Cause I wouldn't give guys like you no rap?
I was walking down the street in the afternoon
I gave you a smile so you assume
That if you said hello, I would be flattered
But I kept on walking and your ego was shattered
I'm Roxanne, the lady devastator
I'll make you feel hotter than it is in Grenada
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E
Roxanne is who I be
And Kangol Kid, ya might be cute
But you ain't gettin' this cause you're much too... ?
You wear that samurai sword on the side
I told all my friends and we all just died
I laughed so hard that my face turned blue
Why be a M. C.? You should learn kung fu
And by the way if I'm such a crab
Why all your girls look like scabs?
First you call me a peach
The Doctor wants to take me to the beach
I got a little rhyme for ya each
I've seen your girls, they both need a leash
Such bow wow babies I think they got rabies
You think you're touching me, boy, you must be crazy
You got your nerve to wanna be my man
They call me The Real...
Roxanne, Roxanne
Can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne
I wanna be your man

Now Educated Rapper, Imma give you a fit
'Cause when you tried to talk to me, you was full of shit
You see the truth and the fact is that I don't need you
Your I.Q. Is really one point two
I don't like your rap cause your rap is dead
Educated Rapper no sense in your head
So when you met me I paid you no mind
Dictionary breath, you're one of a kind
You said your name was Gary
Didn't choose to call you Barry
Didn't care if your name was mother Mata Hari
I choose to call you sonny because you have a tummy
My fathers not a fairy, you're the one who walks so funny
You're nose is always runny
You look like Bugs Bunny
All your raps are old ancient as a mummy
Your house is so scummy
Your clothes are so bummy
But now with your hit record all I want is your money
Educated Rapper you ain't nothing but a dummy
You try to be chummy all you plays gin rummy
I bet makin' love to you must really be crummy
You say it's customary to give your commentary
I say it's crap you're full of strawberries
Your rap is so weak and your face is so scary
You always find a rap like yours in any cemetery
So do you know you didn't even pass
All you received was a kick in the ass
That's what you get 'cause I've had enough
Ain't that right Mix Master Ice cream puff
Roxanne, Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne

When I heard this record I said who's the producers?
A group named Full Force, a bunch of losers
They're a singin' group so how should they know?
Putting out records with UTFO
I'm what's happening I know that's a fact
So UTFO... Bust that!
Since I'm the new girl around the block
The Kangol Kid and especially Doc
Would like to sleep with me if he can
But you're just a boy you're not even a man
The girls know your name, it's getting around
Doctor Ice you're the laugh of the town
You tried to throw a game
But it wasn't working out
You lied about the beach
You took me to your house
I said me the Rox, give up the box
So you could brag about it for the next 6 blocks?
Shee you must be crazy, you're goin' too fast
Doctor I don't know where your hand's been last
You can't fool me 'cause down beneath
You're a hood, a crook, a liar, a thief
I know how you operate from the start
You like to breakdance and you like to break hearts
So listen up 'cause I don't say this everyday
Ho girl... ?
The only operating that you do
Is ripping off cars in a minute or two
You stole every last Cadillac
Sold it back and kept the hubcaps
You are the one you thought you had me roped
But you hung yourself with your own stethoscope
You said ""oooh"" now what the hell was that?
Your voice ran high now it sounds real wack
You call me at 9 to arrange a date
I said meet me at the beach and don't be late
(So did you meet him at the beach?)
Hells no, in the middle of December when it's 20 below
I'm the real...
Roxanne, Roxanne
I wanna be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne
And here's our game plan

Wheres the beat you guys can't deal it
I need a man who can make me feel it",https://genius.com/Utfo-the-real-roxanne-lyrics
Fairytale Lover,UTFO,1983,"They say if you believe in fairy tales
Your love will never fail
If this myth is true
Sweetheart, you know what we should do...
Be like Alice in Wonderland
Jack and Jill holdin' hands
And every afternoon
We can watch the cows jump over the moon
And if it happens to get cold
We can take a walk down the Yellow Brick Road
And if we run into Little Boo Peep
We can help her find the sheep...
A love that's full of fun and fantasy
The way our love will always be
This you won't regret
'Cause I'll be your Romeo
You'll be my Juliet
Alice in Wonderland
Jack and Jill holdin' hands
And every afternoon
We can watch the cow jump over the moon
And if it happens to get cold
We can take a walk down the Yellow Brick Road
No tellin' what we'll find
But I know, at the end of the line
You'll be my Fairy Tale Lover
Be my fairy Tale Lover
Be my fairy Tale Lover
Be my fairy Tale Lover
Love with me alone
In our fairy tale own town
We'll have a house built outta stone
And no wolf will blow it down
Rainbows in the sky
And our dreams will get us by
And our love would never die",https://genius.com/Utfo-fairytale-lover-lyrics
Ya Cold Wanna Be With Me,Lethal,UnKnown,"Ya cold wanna be with me

Hey girl, you wanna be with me?
Because I need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You cold wanna be with me
Because you need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You wanna be with me?
Because I need someone to be with, someone to talk to
You cold wanna be with me
Because you need someone to be with, someone to talk to

Because the way I live nowadays
People are different, they act real funny towards me
They say, I think, I'm nice
Why, because I'm makin records? But I'm still the same Doctor Ice

The same with me, they make me laugh
People gettin jealous (cause we be signin autographs)
I try to figure it out, no doubt
(But the way things are goin) I'm ready to jet out

Word, gettin a girl is hard, it ain't funny
Kangol don't know if she want me or my money
So I'm bein picky, cause I ain't sure
And I'm livin a life you might call insecure

I want a nice individualistic that's not materialistic
Not bein egotistic, ???I decide consentualistic???
The body artistic, a little bit of lipstick
Those the type of girls that make the Doc lovesick

Well, I'm definitely a lover, hard when I'm undercover
I'll do kinky things to you if you swear not to tell your mother
I'll push, but I won't shove ya, as long as I'm above ya
When I leave just promise me, ""Kangol ???? I love ya""

I want a girl with action, 
'control' like Janet Jackson
I hate the dark, I'm on the light so I can see reaction
Against all relaxin, prepare for steady waxin
When you leave you must pay E - for what? - satisfaction


Tired of these girls tryin to play the role
Everytime I see em, they're on a stroll
Teasin the fellas, wearin tight pants
Leadin us on after a slow dance
But in search of love that's how I'm livin
I want a girl to give me the same thing that I am givin
To her, from now till the day I depart
But she's got to be a redbone, a beautiful work of art
That is the way this pisces views
Like Gigi Williams on the Eye-Witness News
I hate a girl that knows every guy
Before you introduce, he already says hi
I feel like punchin her dead in the grill
But that's ill, so Doc just chills
Cause if it's meant to happen, that's how it'll be
Sooner or later you'll cold be with me

She wants to be with me and I know this for sure
I can tell as soon as she walks through the door
Swings and sways and shakes her stuff like Jello
Waitin for EMD to say hello
Skin-tight clothing with everything left hangin
And all the boys admit that she's well worth bangin
She only talks the talk, never walks the walk
She must be the most ???? up in all New York
Acts like an angel, pretends that she's a saint
A least that's the pretty picture she would love to paint
She's extraordinary, definitely rare
And anyway you want me, baby, I'll be there
I make you feel ??protect??, fill you with bliss
??Send a chill up?? your body with just one kiss
But if you don't show, I won't be stunned
Give your mother my number, I know she'll come


I want a girl that'll turn me on
When I say 'go', I wanna hear her say 'gone'
When I say 'leave', I wanna hear her say 'left'
And if I say 'was it good', she better say 'def'
Cause that's the kinda girl that I am lookin for
I really don't think there are anymore
But if one appears one day
I walk up to her and gently say

I've been starin at you a while
And everytime you see me starin you crack a smile
You cold wanna be with me, it's true
If you didn't, I wouldn't be next to you
So please stop perpetrating
Girl, I'm tired of waiting
For you to hurry up and make your so-called move
That you been talkin about makin, girl, show and prove
There's really no need to talk about it
You know what I want, so what about it?
We can either go fast or slow
Cause I'll be in and out before you know
You say you're resisting
But yet you're still kissing
Everybody know that I been wantin you to kiss
Hey girl, here's a spot you missed
So cold",https://genius.com/Utfo-ya-cold-wanna-be-with-me-lyrics
Burning Bed,Lethal,UnKnown,"(1 out of 12...
1 of 12 men is being burned to death)
( *sirens* )
(Now that's a fire!)

Treat your woman right
Or get that burning bed at night
You've got to treat her right
Treat her right - treat her right
(Willie!)

The women of today ain't with it
If you ain't gonna be loyal, forget it
I know the deal, so I admit it
Because I knew a brother that did it
He used to be a nice looking dude, the ladies' choice
He would charm them all with the sound of his voice
He's not a sucker, a bum, the boy ain't soft
He likes to be clean and dress his ass off
He was light-skinned with curly hair
He would make his girl think he was so sincere
Always said ""I'm cool,"" called himself an expert
Comin home every night with lipstick on his shirt
She took it like a champ and let him do it
Until one day he really blew it
Rappin to girls one day by the dozen
And one of those girls was his girlfriend's cousin
He was so blind cause he was on a roll
Comin home drunk one night singin James Brown's soul
""Get up-a!"" bangin on the door he said
""Get up-a!"" and banged once more
So she opened the door with a smile on her face
Brung him to the bed, untied his shoe lace
Took off all his clothes and then she said
""Good night sucker"" - and burned the bed
So

Treat your woman right
Or get that burning bed at night
You've got to treat her right
Treat her right - treat her right
Burn em up
She only burn you can see what's ugly, Willie
Now you look like Richard Fire
I mean Richard Pryor, Willie
Willie, jump in the pool
(Now that's a fire!)

So never in life think that you're too great
Cause it's very thin line between love and hate
You see, he wasn't just burned, the boy was torched
Burned from head to toe and then so-and-so was scorched
He's with the same girl, now he's sincerer
She ain't worried about a thing cause he ain't goin nowhere
When I see him now I say ""yo bro""
Cause he's the darkest brother that I now know
No more Casanova, that life is over
He used to drink heavy, now he stays sober
She burned him bad, now he stays alert
But I know when they make love, brother, it hurts
You wouldn't think the girl would hurt a fly
But she proved that to be a goddamn lie
From what I recall, he gives her much respect
Point blank, word, she got him in check
So

Treat your woman right
Or get that burning bed at night
You've got to treat her right
Treat her right - treat her right

See, you can hit em, beat em, call em a creep
But remember, homeboy, you've got to sleep
So chill, be nice or pay the price
Of bein burned, walk easy like Doctor Ice
Get out the house, Willie!
(Now that's a fire!)
(Fire)
Willie's on..
(Fire)
Get out the house, Willie
(Fire)
Damn, you shoulda seen this..
(Fire)
She burned him bad
Damn Willie
(Fire)
That mama ain't Willie
(Fire)
If his woman ain't Ms. Willhelmina
(Fire)
She burned him up
She burned him up
(Fire)
Don't get the burning bed, Willie
(Fire)
It's too late now
You're blacker than black
(Fire)
You used to be light-skinned, ain't no turnin back
(Fire)
You look like some left-over from a cook-out, Willie
Yo
I told you leave that bitch alone
I told ya, Willie
I told ya
(Aight, that's cool)",https://genius.com/Utfo-burning-bed-lyrics
Beats and Rhymes,UTFO,1983,"Fly girls feel the groove
Homeboys bust a move
Our beats and rhymes you can’t resist
Hm. Bust this
Beats and rhymes (x4)
If future rap is in effect, then clean up all the latest
We’re the best and you can bet that we are now the greatest
Do remember, don’t forget you love us, you don’t hate us
Stay on our side, don’t you betray us
When you meet us, treat us right, 'cause you need us
You need us tonight and you can’t defeat us
Music evolved, the problem was solved
Party people must get involved

So all you ladies in the place tonight
We got a rap we think will make you feel right
It ain’t no problem, baby, as you know
The curtain’s open so we’re gonna start the show
So girls don’t you worry
Don’t you think about the things you might have left behind
So girls won’t you hurry
'Cause UTFO emcees are full of beats and rhymes
The beat has gotta be, has gotta be fresh
Has gotta be fresh to impress the rest
Has gotta be bold, so you can all cajole
Your emotions and your feelings so you won’t grow old
Before your time, you’re pryin’, before you reach your prime
You’re begging in the street for a nickel and a dime
Wait on the corner or the welfare line
Got to be there at a quarter to nine
We’re not fiction, we’re fact with rhymes down pat
We express our feelings and we never hold back
Hey girls don’t deny it, don’t knock it ‘til you try it
You hear this record, I’d buy it, you should buy it
Don’t wait, don’t hesitate, 'cause if you do it might be too late
Keep it in mind and don’t waste no time
UTFO is full of beats and rhymes

This jam is workin’, we got the beats and rhymes
(Full Force get fresh!)
Don’t stop the beats, don’t stop the rhymes, don’t stop the music
Music’s one of a kind, we got fresh beats and rhymes
Give us a chance to blow your mind!
Yo, Doc, you think I should go now?
No! Kangol, let’s go!

Ya supersonic musi-izzo izza kizzay
Rizzay, hizzop, spit a gizzo his head
Wiz-a-kizz and dizzy wit adoos-a-zee
Izz-oc the izz-ice, kizz-ang izz-ol and EMD
Mizzay-bee (mizzay-bee!) mizzay-bee mizza
Kizz-om izzen trizzay, kizz-ibbid itchizza
Izzi-bizzu-bizzatoo, kizz-om izzen trizaay
Is the beat too rough, can the beat get by?
Are the rhymes on time, can the beat defy?
I think so, I think they’re fly!
Why? Why? Why, why simplify!

I’m Doc Ice the first, not the second or third
My zodiac is Pisces and that’s my word
Born on March 2nd, not the 3rd
And this little piece of rap must be heard
That I’m rich in rhymes, rich indeed
If you cut me with a knife, money I will bleed
But I’m not a millionaire and I ain’t cheap
I always give my love away, baby I don’t keep
My feelings inside, 'cause if I do I would burst
And if I had a problem, well baby you’d be the first
To know how I feel, 'cause my feeling is real
And I know that you know that I know the deal
That I’m a law-abiding citizen, I don’t break the law
And I will even get loose when I’m out on the floor
You’re well aware I’m debonair, 'cause I intend
To let you know that my rap is at its end

I’m not a senior or a minor, I wasn’t born in China
Spain, France or even South Carolina
I was born in England, not the USA
(Some people call him British), that’s OK
I’m not Jewish, Jamaican, but 
I’ll keep makin’
Fresh new lines that’ll keep you breakin’
I got a lotta pages of rhymes for different ages
Somehow I knew that I’d be standing on the stages
Performing and rhymin’ is better than crimin'
It’s simple like Simon, it just take some timin'
The fact that I’m a rapper doesn’t separate me
From the business and the doctors with a college degree
Motivation’s the key and if you don’t possess that
You’d better hang it up and give it up, I’m telling you flat
That you’d never make a living in the streets of New York
That’s the way that I think and that’s the way that I talk
Fly girls feel the groove
Homeboys bust a move
Our beats and rhymes you can’t resist
Hm. Bust this

So all you ladies in the place tonight
We got a rap we think will make you feel right
It ain’t no problem baby, as you know
The curtain’s open so we’re gonna start the show
So girls don’t you worry
Don’t you think about the things you might have left behind
So girls won’t you hurry
'Cause UTFO emcees are full of beats and rhymes
Our raps are sheer delight, some say it’s dynamite
I think that they’re all right, who am I to say they’re wrong?
We dress impressively, we do it knowingly
And if you want to be with me then come along

I’m a city slicker baby, not a country boy
And I like to drink milk with my Chips Ahoy!
I never lived on a farm, never milked a cow
And I never felt better than I do right now
I don’t believe in telling lies and this ain't no fib
I’m the one and only rapper called the Kangol Kid
Form my rhymes to my rhythm, my rhythms to my beat
I know it’s unique because you’re moving your feet
And all you ladies on the floor, short or tall
Ugly or pretty, long-haired or bald
I got a message to tell you all
I want y’all to dance 'til London Bridge falls
And just so you men can have a ball
Ladies, show us your underalls
And then hurry, hurry, come and see the show
Of the Educated Rapper, Doctor Ice and Kangol

Skeezer
Let's get it on
Let's get it on

Let's get it on, what's the beef?
Is it my breath? No problem, I'll brush my teeth
There's really no reason why you should flake
Unless you got somethin' you think I'll take
Whatever you got, homegirl, keep it kept
In due respect Kangol will step
To another young lady that'll keep him warm
Hey, what would you say if I said

Let's get it on
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
Skeezer
Let's get it on
Let's get it on

Full-settin' introducin', you know the procedure
If you don't cooperate with me, I don't need ya
Cause if you ain't droppin', I'll stop clockin'
And all the pretty girls I don't know I be rockin'
British by birth and I'll well endowed
And frontin' on me is just not allowed
And if you don't give me what I'm askin' you for
You can meet my friend, the door

So long
She woulda got it on
You ugly skeezer
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
Let's get it on

Can I get a witness that this girl is fine?
I never seen her, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm imaginin' how her body would be
Come, get to this, mercy, mercy me
You got to give it up, you need sexual healing
I'm not a troubled man, this is what I'm feeling
You were sanctified, lady, from the day you were born
Distant lover - what's goin on?

Let's get it on
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
I want you, skeezer
Let's get it on
Let's get it on

I used to think that you was treatin' me wrong
It took a while, I admit, but I caught on
Every day I kept my hands in my pocket
Wonderin' when was I gonna knock it
The more I think about it the more I sweat
The harder you make it the harder I get
If I didn't want you, baby, I wouldn't've wrote the song
How much I got to pay ya, girl, to make you say

Let's get it on
Let's get it on

I love it, girl, when you sit down with me
And if I'm too straight to the point, please, forgive me
I let my fingers do the walkin' too much
Come to think about it, hmm... that's really not such
A terrible gesture, I should test ya
Tried to get ya even though I just met ya
And if I'm lucky and my rap is strong
You might change your mind and say
Let's get it on
Yo Buckwheat
I'ma give you some light on this one
""Ooh, do that""

See, I'm a stubborn kind of fellow but I know I can bring
Happiness, 'cause ain't nothin' like the real thing
If this world were mine I'd be also true
'Cause I'd truly love do be loved by you
And ain't no mountain high enough to stop this wind
I'll cold hitch-hike, that's the way love is
No need to procrastinate all night long
What other than be me

Aight baby, now why you flakin
Ah, you gon' flake
Then I'm just gon' diss you

I heard your mother glasses are so thick, she can see the future

Leader of the Pack,UTFO,1983,"Mix Master!

Well all across the metropolitan U-S-A
Everybody with a mouth's talkin' about our DJ
(Mix Master!) DJ Ice
To be precise, the boy is nice
'Cause he can cut butter, cut records, cut a girl in two
And all you wack DJs, he'll cut the mess out of you
He'll cut paper, cut bread, cut down a tree
And make you wish you were dead
When you might as well be

As a matter of fact, to be exact
This is not fiction, this is all fact
The man in the back is dressed in black
He’s called what we call, the leader of the pack!

Mix Master!
Cuttin' up a storm
Goin' on strong, all night long, go on
He's down by law with the Force Crew
You can say I'm on his  'cause you are too
Some people say that we're the Village People of rhymes
'Cause we all have an image that we stand behind
Like I'm the Soldier of Love, Kangol, I never run
'Cause I possess the medals from the battles I won
And I'm Doctor Ice, so debonair
You can tell that I'm a doctor by the clothes that I wear
And I'm the world's most educated rapper, MD
And I'm causing much damage in the place to be

And as a matter of fact, to be exact
This is not fiction, this is all fact
The man in the back is dressed in black
He’s called what we call, the leader of the pack!

Yes he is above the average man
And he'll cut up any DJ he can
He started from the bottom and took the right route
Now he's scratchin' the break and that's without a doubt
The way I'm going out I think I passed my peak
With Kangol Kid and EMD, we'll never get weak
Rhymes are written everyday and never forgot
Sometimes it's hip-hop or it might have a pop
To write a demo record 
But the MC ain't fresh unless he's rockin' the beat
And the beat can't be beat, it's got to be tough
An original, that's when I say it's rough
From my point of view that's how I feel
And when I say  you know it's real
'Cause I'm the  the fare on the bus
And soon you'll be sayin' in Doc we trust

Well I'm not into surgery, I'm not into books
And I may not look the way you imagined I look
But I'm lookin' good baby and you best believe that
'Cause when they said Kangol, they meant the hat
Uh when they said the Kid they meant me of course
When they said UTFO they meant Untouchable Force
Let me skip that subject and go onto other things
I got a message and the message I bring is
I got the look you want to know better
I'm not Jordache but I consider myself
To never be a loser to none
'Cause I possess the medals from the battles I won
And the way I perform I oughta be sued
'Cause I specialize in bein' nothin' but rude
The leaders of the pack is the ones in command
Comprende, capiche, caput, understand?
Yo! (Bust this)
Yo! (Bust this)
Yo! (Bust this)
Yo! (Bust this)
Yo! (Bust this)
Bust this!

Beware, the fury of prodigious man
I'll discombobulate any rapper I can
My superior vernacular will keep me ahead
Most of you cogitating what I just said
But, that's just a morsel, I'm very discrete
And the formula for rap like this can't be beat
It's not the usual, it can't be condemned
And my preeminent thoughts will linger on to the end
'Cause I'm exemplary in grammar, I was always inclined
Intellected versers like this are hard to find
The elementary, I always obtain
Interesting lyrics are this cure for your brain
And if I was a Mexican, I'd wear a sombrero
If I was a soldier, I'd probably be a hero
But I'm not, I'm into rap
And I'm down with the Mixer, the leader of the pack!
Mix Master Ice!
Mix Master Ice!
Mix Master Ice!
Mix Master Ice!
Mix Master Ice!
Did you like that, huh? (Yeah!)
Huh? (Yeah!)
So if you're all excited and you like it like that
Don't tell me, tell the leader of the pack!

I'm sorry but your scratching is up. Please deposit another record or else your party will be terminated, thank you!",https://genius.com/Utfo-leader-of-the-pack-lyrics
The Ride,Lethal,UnKnown,"	You wanna ride?
	
	I got a ride
Hey girl, just imagine me and you, along the road
Switchin from silent gear to a moany mode
All you gonna hear is  that's the motor, of course
(But don't let it get hot, or you'll feel the force
Hello, my name is Kangol Kid (You can call him Kangol, if you choose)
I'm Dr. Ice (How can you tell?) You can tell by the mous'
And I'm the Educated Rapper (The brainiac
And Mixmaster) woo-hah (The four is back)
Individually speakin, though I'm speakin for the crew
We all have rides, I hope you fellas do too
Mine is very powerful, yes, this is true
Mine can do tricks (What can yours do?)
Mine won't disagree with me, it's never frontin
All I gotta say is: ""Yo, let's go skeezer huntin!""
After those command my ride will stand
Taller and prouder than any man
Crashin through vicious, on wet roads even
In other words, it's (Skeezin season!)
And brakes of course for my protection
So I don't waste my fuel injection
I'm makin it clear, the way I steer
I'll reach my destination - (Ah, I'm here)
	I got a ride
	I got a ride, and you can look inside
	And if I ever die, I wanna die with my ride
	I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
	You wanna know why? Well, because...
It only takes one passenger when it's hot
Unless I wanna share it, okay, why not?
Just imagine a volcano when it's bound to erupt
(You wanna ride?) Come on girl, hurry up
Tell your mother where you're goin, and don't forget
If your mother wanna come, tell your pops: ""Don't fret""
If he wants you home soon, tell him that's insane
(And if he says: ""Picture that"") consider it framed
(I got a ride) As if you didn't know
And if I catch a flat, girl, give me a blow
Cause I don't carry spares, cause spares, they cost
And plus my nuts are too hard to come off
(You dig it?)
You see, my ride is not a stretch-limo Cadillac
To tell the truth, I think my ride is much longer than that
So if you ever see my ride, girl, face to face
I doubt that it'll fit in your parking space
But I'll (push) if you wanna (push) if I gotta
And we can even (push) for the hell, why nada?
It's lovable and huggable and bendable
I won't sell it to ya, baby, but it's rentable
And if you're wonderin why, I'll tell you what for
(They don't make rides like this no more)
	I got a ride
	I got a ride, and you can look inside
	And if I ever die, I wanna die with my ride
	I love the way it hugs, the way like it does
	You wanna know why? Well, because...
You see my ride
A lotta fuel you give it, premium or regular
Any kind of fluid from a female etcetera
Four-wheel drive, so I can get there in a giffy
And turbo-jogs in case I'm lookin for a quickie
But the tighter the roads, the harder I'll pursue
And my goal in my life with my ride is to shoot
For the finish line, so I can get there quick
Ask Bobby, Jimmy, Jack, or you can even ask (Dick)
You can even ask my mechanic
When she saw my ride, she didn't panic
You see, I got garages all over these parts
So I can park the ride whenever it gets dark
I got a sunroof, so wide, you can't miss it
Before I stick my head out, I gotta unzip it
Hey yo, I never got a ticket, if I do one day
They'll have a hard time towin this baby away

Mo’ Bass,Lethal,UnKnown,"We slay
Put the Mix-Master on the fader
And the rhythm of the cuts are always up to data
Boy, it means nothin if we're rockin the place
Without the tremble of the tweeter and the presence of the bass
Mo' bass!

No-now-now-now-now...
N-n-n-now when I say bass, not the base of the pipe
(You mean the bass of a drum?) Yo, that type of bass drum
Will make the people feel it, can you feel it? (We feel it, Doc)
Now that that's straight it's my turn to rock
Listen to the lyrics that the Doc expresses on the wax
You can't compare cause I'll (wax) and (tax), so max
If for some reason I lose my space
That's cause I can't (feel the bass)
Understand?
Walk this way cause here's the way we'll be walkin
Brooklyn style is the way we'll be talkin
And if you ain't with it, without a doubt
By some (brothers) from (Brooklyn) you'll (get) stomped (out)
(That's right)
It's time to get stupid and cold serve the place
B-Fine.. (What's up, Doc?) Mo' bass! (Okay)
As I was writin this rhyme I had to make it worth while
For my brother Jalil Whodini style
Servin left to (right) right to (left)
And it's mandatory the Doc must be (def)
As I swing my rhythm to the beat of the drum
If you can't catch my lyrics, just hum
And yo, if you can't feel the bass don't jump on my case
Full Force.. (What Doc?) On bass more bass

(Bass)

It's a concentrated bass that's heavy and poundin
Covered with a blanket of vocals that are astoundin
Receivin strenght for my medulla oblangata
Injected in a circular platter
Resent about a feeling, a deja-vu
It's the untouchable Force (cold) comin at you
With a quantity of bass that will make your box boom
Make your heart pump, make you tremble and zoom
And you couldn't replicate it even if you were us
It's the Educated Rapper M.D. plus
(And the girl that bobs her knobs, you'll get a bonus)
After you been taken you might wanna phone us
And give us your opinion of this hellafied medley
With interlude and -mission it's twice as deadly
The people love the menu revolvin in my head
Somehow I feel it's up to me to keep em well fed
(What's your name?) D.M. Reppar Detacude
(Yo, what's that?) That's my name spelled backwards
I'm buggin (you be illin)
Back to boggle, baffle, bewilder, beat
Any opposition that would like to compete
Time has gone by and it's become repetitive
Most records I hear are competative
But it's time to put the ball into swing
And present you with a sample of a different thing
A drum track that's as hard as the ghetto
Makes you wanna frolic like sheep in the meadow
Jump back kick, back and relax
The perpetuity of my voice is reachin the max
Combined with the rhythm that's truly volcanic
No need to worry, no need to panic
Cause we possess the element to put a smile on your face
And it's free imports with bass

(Bass)

No matter how good you are, there is someone greater
And since I'm greater you'll become my spectator
You'll watch my every motion
You're nothin but a fish inside my ocean
When it come to swimmin I'm a deep sea diver
Some are live but I am liver
I hate to see anyone expressin doubt
He who speaks first will first find out
Those that have ruled in the past are gone
I am now your leader, lord Djengis Khan
Demandin more bass, why? Because you said you would
I'm a vicious and delicious individual
Ladies compare me to a lollypop
I'm not a sucker, I'm a suckee but let me stop
If you're anything like me, then you got taste
So what are you looking for? (More bass, more bass)
So don't let no one say nothing wrong in your face
There's more of us than of them and we demand more bass
It has nothing to do with you, it's just that we call the shots
If you want a explanation of the women I got
Is that a rapper is supposed to be a person that rhyme
(When he's rhymin) you're supposed to have a really good time
(And if you're not) it mean that you're not really havin a ball
Then the rapper probably wasn't really a rapper at all
(More bass) nothin primitive, I mean recent
In other words I mean, raps flowin decent
The beat has got to be the best, it can't be nothin shady
The bigger the beat, the better the bass, baby
Yo man
Do somethin

My Cut’s Correct,Doin’ It,UnKnown,"(This is far out)
Drop it
Yeah
Dissin all you Robidog deejays that suck
And I ain't gotta call no names

My name is Mixmaster, battle me if you're able
But for now I'm just chillin and yo, I stay stable
One day I react and then it's slow like radiation
Cause suckers bite my cuts, they keep tracin
Me, fraudulatin, then pretend to be the best
I got hands like bombs and they inflict death
My complexion is cream, my ego won't break
And I don't get conceited to the point where my head inflates
So if you wanna battle me, don't get sloppy
Cause when I start cuttin - yo, you better stop me
(Wack DJ's, he cut the mess out of you)

It's somethin about my tactic that makes my scratch kick
A lotta disc jockeys bluff but I react quick
Stay nimble, win battles by landslides
Can do a cut better than you with my hands tied
Behind my back, so hold your breath in
I'm expellin a rhyme within a fraction of a second
Jack of all trades, so label me a veteran
You know my crew by the UTFO lettering
My voice box interlocks on any intercom
I only cut to build the biceps on my arm
My name is Mixmaster, deejays be aware
Because I treat my turntables like car ware
And if you wanna battle me from lack of respect
Ts.. balls - my cut is correct
( *scratches* )

The M-i-x has a quick reflex
It's like a hologram picture, the plot on the set
I'm not a misfit and yo my cuts get better
Label me awesome, the critics all sever
Me from a amateuristic opponent
You wanna battle me? Ha-ha, postpone it!
You can't make what I innovate
The indicator will break if you record me on tape
And yo, I get with it, keep the needle on the pivot
Leader of the Pack, this title I fit it
Jack of all trades but cuttin is my hobby
So listen to the property, the structure and the body
And if you wanna battle me from lack of respect
Ha.. balls - my cut is correct
( *scratches* )

I can take a record apart, then put it back together
I'm clever - never, ever
Lost to any cause, cause it's vital
Practiced and rehearsed to keep this title
I won't be categorized as mediocre
Temper with your psychee and then provoke ya
Runnin off your mouth and talkin crap to me
Is like puttin your dome between a guillotine
It's been that way since block-partyin
I mesmerize your mind, then work your body and
No time for profilin or ladi-dadi-in
This was predetermined since kindergartian
I'll put my 12's in a museum
So fools like you will pay to come see em
And if you wanna battle me from lack of respect
Balls, baby - my cut is correct
( *scratches* )
My cut is correct
I guess I'm gonna have to just
(Sign em up, s-s-sign em up)
Yeah
(Sign em up, sign em up, sign em up)
(Sign em up, s-s-sign em up, sign em up)
Sign em all up like children

Hanging Out,UTFO,1983,"We don't mean to offend you, but that's just the way we are
Hanging out
Hanging out

Having it so bad, well know your lady's got a man
Then you start to do the things you do everyday
Hanging in the streets with a UTFO beat
Snap that, Doctor D and you can have it your way
Hanging with the guys, coolin' out and gettin' by
I don't know who askin' for it, it's just the gimmick they play
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
Just to cry, dirty pockers only gotta say with

Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out

Well I was chilling alone on (5th Avenue)
Within five minutes came (Charleston Chew)
And on his arm a girl we call Fatty
Even though her real name (was Peppermint Patty)
Her body was (Chunky), it was like a Goodyear
She had a little crush on the (Three Musketeers)
And no sooner then they left in their vicious car
I met my homeboy, (Mr. Goodbar)
He said he took (Ms. Hershey) to the (Milky Way)
And they had a (Baby Ruth) last year today
I said ""Brother you're slick, ain't nobody slicker
You're even worse than (Clark Bar Snicker)""
It was an (Almond Joy) to see the bunch
But I missed my homeboy, (the Nestle Crunch)
But I met this freak, she was a (Bit-Of-Honey)
Her eyes (Starburst) when she saw my money
And (Whatchamacallit), I forgot his name
He was a (Butternut) in every game
Well it's time to leave, time for me to go
So I hollered ""(Hubba Bubba)"" to let them know
That I had good time when I bust a (Peanut Chew)
On a sweet fine lady they call Suzy Q

Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out

Attention everybody if it's not too much
I'm the Educated Rapper just keepin' in touch
Keep in mind I'm serious about what I say
When it comes to disses I just don't play
My rhymes have to be smart, strikin' you in the heart
I'm not the Educated Rapper girl, just for the part
I can't deny I wanna be with some B-O-D-Y
I gotta leave a message 'cause I can't let it by
So remember, listen closely, definitely you will find
There's something to be learned written down on the rhyme
You're all invited, (come along), I'll do you no wrong
I want you, and you, and you to come on
Tamaga made of books, you can take some looks
There's something there for everybody, even the crooks
And you will soon see, how really smart you could be
Instead of walking 'round the streets, roaming endlessly
Patience is a virtue, not something there to hurt you
So mention something weak-is, I won't let it serve you
Don't get me wrong, I like hanging out too
I also got my act together, so how about you?
So hang out, and bug out, and keep it in mind
Hard work in due time will bring sunshine!

Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, without a doubt
It's all about hanging out
Hanging out and cooling out and chilling out without a doubt
It's all about hanging out

In the summertime, (Hanging out 'til 4 AM)
You sleep until it's 9 (Then you do it all again)
You're chillin' most rough (That you can't deny)
Hey life can be tough (But you're still gettin' by)
Don't take it too far (Or you'll be doin' time)
It's all because of y'all (That we got so much crimes)
So when we say (Hanging out) we mean just (Chilling out)
Don't you cry (Close your mouth) It's all about (Hanging out)
So when we say (Hanging out) we mean just (Chilling out)
Don't you cry (Close your mouth) It's all about (Hanging out)
Hanging out, cooling out, don't ya pout, hanging out
Hanging out, cooling out, don't ya pout, hanging out

Lethal,Lethal,UnKnown,"Lethal - meaning - equivalent to deadly
And if you came to battle, homeboy, I hope you're ready
Cause Doc will be the slayer, EMD will be the preacher
Kangol
 will be the lord while Mix-Master tries to teach ya
Not to fuck with the crew because we take on all comers
Slayin the scums through the winters and the summers
When I perform I wear rings that are nuggets
And you can best believe I'm comin ruff and rugged
Don't get me upset cause I'll persist to doubt you
Beat you in your face cause I don't give a damn about you
I'll make you lose control of your physical anatomy
Smile in my face until I'm gone, then be mad at me
At the Apollo Doctor Ice was cold hearted
I kill all the amateurs before they get started
Whenever I battle it be thunderin and stormin
So don't get nervous, that's just Doc performin

Kill the beat!
Kill the beat!
(Kill the beat!)
Kill the beat!
So suckers don't play us close cause we're lethal

Pull out the tools, kill all the fools
And all those suckers sellin drugs in schools
(The White House is unaware) Anthrax!
(Watch the ?????) drop the axe
On all the political people
Killin the poor (like a junkie with a needle)
We was born to be rulin, teachin and schoolin
All that's ??????? while on the stage coolin
Devoted to demolish, slay anyone
And so it was written and so it shall be done
Man, if you think I'm bluffin (you ain't seen nothin)
Ass and caps is all we're bustin

(Lethal)

We only wanna beat you down with sound
(If the girl wanna get it on
Tell the girl) get on the ground
(Rock it to the left, cause I'm not deaf)
(That's the way...) ah-ha ah-ha
The untouchables, puttin heads to bed
Cause (that's the way...) ah-ha ah-ha

Yo bust it, from state to state they call me the great
In England they call me the educated mate
Cause I'm known to be quiet, at parties we riot
Sometimes I get beside myself, I can't deny it
The rhythm of the beat has EMD on the attack
I'm bad - I'm better - I'm back
(Danny)
(Lethal)

I'm lethal, and my venom can kill
There ain't a graveyard I can't fill
With bodies I've tortured, ripped in two
(Why) cause I had nothin better to do
If you ask me again, you'll regret it
My name is Kangol, don't forget it
This message is for the illiterate people
What are we, Anthrax? (We're lethal!
Solid like rock, above yo level
Lethal like a bomb, heavy like metal

Bite It,UTFO,1983,"Our rhymes are recited (and we are delighted)
To give you permission to...bite it!
Yum!
Yum!
Yum!
Yum!
Yum!
Yum!


If you ever had a shadow, one like mine
Time after time, you would find
Everything you did, and everything you do
And everything you want to do, they'd want to too
If you jumped off a cliff they'd be right there
As long as they could be like you, they wouldn't care
It's sort of strange, but it happens this way
And you should know what I'm trying to say
When suckers try to be like you all the time
If you and that person share the same mind
But I call 'em biters, imitators, copycats, and duplicators
No matter how you look at it they want to be
Just like you or maybe just like me
But you have to be a biter to be like that
There's no holding back I'm telling you flat
You have to have a mind of your own
Stay off everybody's phone
One day you'll be all alone
In your own little Twilight Zone
You-are!
Yo Mixmaster, what you say?
I said you-are!

Well I'm Kangol and that's a fact
And for some reason, my name's on everybody's hat
One theme that I  tell me they didn't know
That I was Kangol from UTFO
But to be another Kangol, another Kangol Kid
That would be irrelevant that's right, that's what I said
To be a mellow supreme, the consequences are extreme
Not even  fantasize that dream
When my mind goes wild, my friends will all see
I got finesse and I'm as cool as can be
I survive in a fire like Doc and E, for being so extraordinary
Because my knowledge has shown that 
Until a year when MCs rock a microphone
And from the day I was born, never did nothing wrong
Just rocked all night to the break of dawn
So you know I'm gonna rock it, give it all I got , it's like another day
And I can even pop, definitely talented  I acquired the skill
And come to think about it, you know what I think I will
Be the best there ever was and ever will be, ever more
 better than he  employed  in consideration
UTFO will  organization, so bite it!
Bite it!
Bite it!

Well I'm the Doc (Right!)
All day and night (Right!)
I'm black and white (Right!)
Is that alright (It's alright!)
So if it's alright I guess I can rock you 'til I'm ready
To stop, to break or pop
The way I feel now, I just got to rock
 rhymes like I pray, I pray everyday
'Cause I always got to have something new to say
'Cause you always got the brothers with the negative minds
Saying ""Man, he's running the same ol' rhyme""
And you know who's saying, all of the biters
Trying to take credit from us writers
I say a line, they bite it, and now they think they're winning
But the middle's so fresh that they forgot the beginning
Then they try to bite it line for line
But by that time I'm at the end of my rhyme
But in this case, bite it for me
Because it's certified by Doctor I-C-E, so bite it!",https://genius.com/Utfo-bite-it-lyrics
Lisa Lips,UTFO,1983," Yo Doc, you know that girl over there?
 Yeah man she's a neighborhood housekeeper
 Yo Black, I don't know, so I'm gonna throw that girl some riz-ap if you know what I'm siz-aying?
 Yo homeboy, don't do it to yourself
 Ahh Doc, let him do it to himself
 Aight

Excuse me sweetheart, um what's your name?
Oh how you doing Lisa? I'm Kangol from UTFO
Yo what you mean ""so big""?
Yeah stop being little Roxanne, right
Let me ask you a serious question, you got a boyfriend?
Oh yeah, well um, how long have you had this problem
You know what I oughta turn you onto my Doctor Ice
You know I mean he's got a cure for things like this
And before you know it boo, you'll be my girl
Yo Doc, let me ask you...
 Nope, I don't wanna meet the young lady
Yo E man, what's his problem, man?
What's your problem?
Yo, yo, who is this man?
Ha ha ha, that's Lisa Lip
Yo Doc don't you have a cure for this?

There's no prescription, none in the world
That I could prescribe for this nasty girl
It might sound crazy, but look at her lip (Oh shh!)
Don't curse Kangol, just say ""Oh dip""
You was deffin', deffin' for that leg
You ran to Lisa Lip and begged, begged, begged
She told you yes 'cause she thought she was slick
Told you c'mon you was the perfect vic
She might've let ya  and get  for free
I mean yo, Kangol, you couldn't see?
But I figured you would, 'cause you don't listen
Tell you time after time, but you keep kissin'
Think about what you almost did
It might have led to a little Kangol Kid
I meant to tell you Barry Davis was a permanent friend
She picked him up and can't get rid of him
She tried every antidote that I prescribed
But he just won't leave, I mean she's stuck with this guy
Since you're my boy and everything, let me tell you
If you mess with her, you'll be stuck with them too

Lisa, Lisa Lips!
(How long have you had this problem?)
Lisa (Lisa), Lisa Lips!

Hey Lisa, I don't know if all of this is true
But Lord knows I've heard so much about you
I heard you don't do windows and don't do floors
But you wax and polish behind closed doors
Is this a rumor or is this true
That you do everything they say you do?
Now that I'm lookin' at your face, I say ""Oh dip!""
I think there's something out of place (Man it's just her lip)
It's so red and raw like you did a tour
Of the whole neighborhood and you still want more
You kissed Andy, Joe, Alex too
You kissed Jerry, Paul,  my friends Junior and Lou
You kissed Kason, Damon, Ecstasy, and Jalil
If you're askin' me  you were ill
I don't what to believe, tell me is this true
Is your number 8-5-7-64-52?
Because I've seen it in school on the bathroom wall
It said ""Lisa loves to party, come one, come all""

Lisa, Lisa Lips!
(How long have you had this problem?)
Lisa, Lisa Lips!

Hey fellas let me have a minute of your time
Let the Educated Rapper educate your mind
Lisa is fly and most definitely chillin'
But she has a little friend that I would call a villain
He's deadly, and dangerous, and don't you know
If you ever had to fight him, signs will show
You'll be bleeding from the lips and taking trips
To the Doctor Ice for medical tips
You'll be through with life and all the people will say
Keep away, keep away and don't you play
You'd have to be an imbecile to mess around with Lisa, be for real!
Do you want to be the laughing stock of the block
Or be just like an itch on an athlete's jock?
Frustrated, isolated from the rest of the gang
And when it comes to socializing, you just can't hang!

Lisa (Ooh hoo!), Lisa Lips!
(Ooh ooh!)
Lisa (Ooh yeah!), Lisa Lips!
(How long have you had this problem?)
Damn!
We can't deny that you are fly
But around the guys is when we lie
We can't tell that it's you we did
'Cause if we did, the word would spread, big!
Girl we apologize, don't be stunned, don't be surprised
If you thought for a minute that we believed you
Not only are you nasty (Not only are you nasty)
(Not only are you nasty)
You stupid too!

Stupid too

All About Technic,Doin’ It,UnKnown,"Shut up and sit up as I wet up the set-up
If you don't like it, punk, get out or get up
Do whatever you wanna do, suck on a lollypop
I'm like the breakball, this is the last stop
I made, the dribbles and dodgin the puppets
Whoever standin in my way is a culprit
On tape, I rape the women with rap
And in the near future their babies will clap
To a sequel that's equally soothin like Nitequil
I know that you thought that I lost it but I will
Keep on producin rhythms even better
If you really love them, then write me a letter
I'm better than best, I'm above all the rest
I can be reached at the fan club address
That's the driving force that encourage me
No rapper worries me, they can't discourage me
I remained since my arrival
Believe in myself and believe in survival
My rappin is edible, sweet like bonbons
I'm ridin the bassdrum to stay in the top-top
Just when you think I'm runnin out of breath
I bounce back with a rap - doubly def
The Educated Rapper's verses will stifle you
Scavengers, novice rappers, you're trifle, you
Haven't the slightest idea how much I ruffle
Your conscience, your insides, I watch you hustle
I don't just talk to be talkin
I don't bop it anyway to be walkin
I just try to be me, E
The only E, - E.M.D

Yeah boy, that's my boy E.M.D., Educated Most Definitely
But right about now Kangol is in effect
And I'ma talk to my man Mixmaster Ice
Now check this out
You know that UTFO's all about talkin about young ladies, right?
Right about now we gon' talk about this young lady around the neighborhood, alright?
And this young lady, she is def
Fly, firm, dope, youknowmsayin?
She - yo, she's correct, youknowmsayin?
Now Ice, I want you to tell everybody here how bad this young lady is
Tell em right about now, Ice
(Bad meaning bag, but bad meaning good)	--] Run-D.M.C
Yeah boy
Now when Ice say a young lady is bad, she is definitely bad, youknowmsayin?
Ice, you see any bad young ladies in the audience?
(Yeah)
Like I thought, homeboy
But back to the young lady, alright?
Check this out
She couldn't stand still for nothin
She was always on the (go)
I mean she would (go) from one guy to another
And then she'd (go) from that guy to another guy
And if there was a whole bunch of guys in the room
Ice, tell me what this young lady would do
(Go) (go) (go) to him
(Go) (go) then to him
Then to him, to me, my man B-Fyne, E, Doc, everybody
(Go) (go) (go)
Now you fellas are probably thinkin that eh -
It's kinda hard to get this young lady, right?
But let me tell you:
All you gotta do to this young lady is whistle
And check this out, she's so much on a mission
She'll walk by you and wait for you to whistle
On a serious tip
She'll even hear you if you whistled under water

Back to the ladies
Let me tell you a little somethin
I've seen my man Mixmaster Ice in action
And when my man whistles ladies just cold go nut, youknowmsayin?
Ice, show them what I'm talkin about

But eh - back to the original story, alright?
Now the young lady I was tellin you about, I ain't tell you her name
But eh - well eh - we call her Technic
Cause she be makin moves, youknowmsayin?
But yo, my man Ice, he video-taped what him and this young lady did, alright?
It was like a movie with Ice in it
Check this out
Started with one finger - two fingers - three fingers - four
His whole hand disappeared, you couldn't see it no more, youknowmsayin?
Now you ladies is gonna like this
My man's wrist disappeared, up to his forearm
Then he started illin with his elbow, serious, with his elbow like this
With his elbow!
Now I know some of you young ladies out there goin, ""Euwww, that's gross!""
But you gon' love this
After his arms got tired
All we heard was
(How low can you go?)	--] Chuck D
Let me tell you how low he went

Calling Her a Crab,UTFO,1983,"Hey, stupid!
Yeah, you Roxanne
Get your face out the garbage can
Don't try to hide now since we made you a star
Come out and face it like the man you are

Calling her a crab

Well I'm the K-A-N-G-O-L the K-I-D
I'm on the mic rhyming well as you can all see
I got a name of a hat
As I recall, Roxanne's grandmother's head is bald
Your father's a crow, your sister's hair won't grow
Your mother's always making like the wind that blows
Your brother never think, I bet his drawers are pink
As far as I know your whole family stinks
So let the word spread that you're as good as dead
From what your man told me, you're no good in bed
So keep this all in mind, and don't step out of line
'Cause I am the master of the rhyme
They once locked a lady up until she escaped
They wasn't sure what she was, said she looked like an ape
I thought they was exaggerating, but I was wrong
'Cause the lady looks more like a King Kong
Eating her bananas, swinging on vines
Hunters come along and then they snuff her from behind
Take her to the city and they put her in the zoo
The lady gets pregnant and here comes you
Talking that mess, thinking that you're great
I knew all the time that your parents were apes
If you didn't know baby, that makes you one too
So here's some bananas, go home to your zoo
Find yourself a man, not a fairy like your father
I know you're trying hard, but you gotta try harder
'Cause calling you a crab is not a figure of speech
You're not an apple or pear, you're a bum on a beach

She's such a crab
Calling her a crab
She's such a... crab

For some dumb reason you thought you were ahead
But you put your big foot in your mouth instead
And I'm about to end this tale
In such a way it cannot fail
You thought my name was Larry and that's a joke
That you'll keep believing 'til the day you croak
You said you love to marry, but picture that
On my Kodak that would be wack
Your mother's name was Mary and that's the truth
She looks like a Bigfoot and I got proof
And as for you, I just don't know
Your brain has gotta be filled with H2O
You took our beat and made yourself famous
And now you're gonna look like a great big anus
What turns you on? What makes you tick?
Did you think for a minute you would be my pick?
That would be an idiotic move that I positively would never approve
You're not bad-looking, I can't complain
But you're a stupid knuckleheaded nincompoop without a brain
You'll probably stay a virgin 'til you're wrinkled and old
Somehow you think your body is solid gold
I think I'll do without instead
'Cause there's nothing but rocks inside your head
You talk a lot feces, you're full of waste matter
And every Roxanne that exists must scatter
You're just a waste, a big disgrace
I think you better run and hide your face
'Cause what we say will set it straight
And dogs like you we eliminate
And do you know, to be honest and true
I could never put up with a girl like you

She's such a crab
Calling her a crab
She's such a... crab

Give me a mic and a beat and I'll be straight
With a crab that says I can't operate
Why'd you ruin a person, that's what it does
But you'll never be the man that your momma was
You know if ugly was a burger you'd be a Big Mac
Two all-pork patties surrounded by fat
There's one more thing that I forgot to mention
Your father's so poor, he can't pay attention
You don't have enough money, baby that's funny
Huh huh huh ha, he he he, hey he he, honey
Why'd ya try to get loose on a doctor like me?
See I could've helped your looks with plastic surgery
Remodel your nose, there's a bump in the middle
But to fix your whole face, that's a medical riddle
You're a living proof that they haven't perfected
The modern science of the birth control method
(Crab!) And... I don't usually break 'cause that's not my style
But I figured this one was worth my while
Took off my doctor's coat, ran down the 
Spin twice, turned into the hood, the rock
Now I'm stalking the street 'cause I was underestimated
And now Roxanne must be terminated
What you said about the crew makes me sick
So when I see you on a stage, I'mma hit you with a brick
Boom! Right in your face
And then the name Roxanne will be a big disgrace
See you failed to realize all the rhymes are polished
So as I'm now running Roxanne is demolished",https://genius.com/Utfo-calling-her-a-crab-lyrics

Split Personality,Skeezer Pleezer,UnKnown,"Split personality, split personality

You know I got five people inside of me
Tryin' to take control my body
I know they're there, without a doubt
'Cause every once in a while, they'll all speak out, like

What is it? What can it be?
Get wizz it, get bizzy
Don't laugh 'cause I can't control it
I try my best to hold and hold it
But, you see, they got the best of me

Hon, hon, poo, poo, merci, oui, oui
I wish they'd leave me alone, and then I'll be free

Ah, Doctor Ice, so sorry


I be fightin' with my boy, ya can't control me
'Cause I truly admire 'im, that's what my father told me
Be careful  what me make the young girl bawl
So spar with me, I don't spar at all
Yo, it's gettin' crazy, it's gettin' outta hand
Five personalities is more than I can stand
But, uh, bear with me until it's gone
Uh oh, I feel another one coming on

What's up, party people in the place to be
My name is Miguel, chief rocker MC
I'm chillin' in the to be, zhu know
And to you sweet young ladies,  beso

Tu eres linda y quero sabra tu nombre
Para 
Para mi Pariso 
Uh, check it out, ya know
See I could be a married man with a beautiful wife
But, then again, I'm living the (hoh, hoh, hoh, but it's just so ridiculous) life
Split personality, split personality
I can't control my split personality
Split personality, split personality
I can't control my split personality

Well, I'm a singer, a dancer, a rapper, too
I could do anything that anybody could do
I can act like a crook and steal a book off a shelf
Or I can act like a cop and arrest myself
To do this, you must have a strong mentality
In other words, gotta have a split personality
As a matter of fact, to be exact
Come to think about it, I'm somewhat like that
'Cause a split personality goes and comes
Like two people trapped inside of one
One's a nice person, the other is not
One drinks cold water and the other drinks hot
One minute you're in my arm and I'm feeling you around
Then before you know it, baby, I'm beatin' you down
The I'd say sorry and together we cry
Then I look you in your face, and spit in your eye
Then I'd snatch a baby's lollipop, but then give it back
Smile at his mother before I get slapped
Help an old lady across the street
Then I'd trip the crab by sticking out my feet
But then I'd pick her up before she dirties her dress
And charge her five dollars for all that mess
First a softy, a bully, then hard again
So, baby, please tell me when will this end?
I used to get high, but now my system is dry
I used to tell the truth, but now I lie
As the girls go by, I used to say ""Hi""
But now I diss 'em, with no reply
I know I ain't right, but that's the way that I am
Excuse me, if ya might, but I don't give a damn
'Cause I try to be polite, but sometimes I miss
And get rude, and say things like this
Hey, you! Yo, I'm talkin' to you, black!
Are you stupid, or were you born like that?
Come on, give me an answer, not three million
In fact, SHUT UP, how dare you voice your opinion
You skeezer snatcher, big disease catcher
Gonna, gonna, get 'cha
Get 'cha, get 'cha, got 'cha
Don't blame it on your father, you told me that ya love 'im
Blame it on your mothers, all five of 'em
From what I see, ya got a problem, man
Comprende, capiche, caput, understand?
If you were smart, you'd probably do this instead
Take your brain out your pants and put it back in your head
Then I'd apologize with a sweet apology
It's not my fault, it's the person inside of me
Split personality, split personality
I can't control my split personality
Split personality, split personality

Kangol & Doc,Skeezer Pleezer,UnKnown,"Good evening home boys and fly girls
B-boys and b-girls, parents and politicians
Pimps, prostitutes, pickpockets and punks
I'm proud to present at this present moment
The powerful presentation by the proud performers
U.T.F.O
And if you're dense and dumb
And don't belong in this damn district
And never decide to discover yourself what it stands for
It stands for Un-Touchable Force Organization
May I continue?
(Yes, you may)
And like Peter Piper picked a piece of pickled pepper
There's never been a rapper who can rap like this or better
Now, I know you wanna have a ball
But I got a question to ask you all
If everybody in the place wanna party, clap your hands
If everybody in the place wanna party, clap your hands
If everybody in the place wanna party
And I do mean every, every, everybody
If everybody in the place wanna party, clap your hands
If everybody in the place wanna party, clap your hands
If everybody in the place wanna party, clap your hands
If everybody in the place wanna party
And I do mean every, every, everybody
If everybody in the place wanna party, clap your hands
Now, if the person next to you is ugly, clap your hands
Now, if the person next to you is ugly, clap your hands
Now, if the person next to you is ugly
And I do mean very, very, very ugly
If the person next to you is ugly, clap your hands
Hit it, Kangol
We got a lotta ugly people right here in the crib
I didn't say you was ugly, but she did
But if you believe what she said is true
She ain't got the problem, boy, you do
So everybody ha-ha, everybody whoo
Everybody ha-ha, everybody whoo
Everybody in the place, if you're not the wack
And if your mother ain't got a big mole on her back
If your hair is brushed and your teeth ain't cracked
Let me hear you, let me hear you say ""leader of the pack""
(The leader of the pack)
Say ""leader of the pack""

Mix Master, they want you, black
Listen to what I say
Sucker crews don't dare play
'Cause every day, guys around the way
Tell us all that we ain't down
But  all over town
What do they say?
They say that...
We rock the best, and we got most finesse
Oh, thank God Almighty we're blessed
As you can see, we dress to impress
(Paging Doctor Ice)
(Paging Doctor Ice)
(Where is he?) (Find him!) (Flawless)

Well, I'm a doctor, known as a physician
I'm rapping 'cause that's my position
When I'm on the mic it's like surgery
With my mic as a scalpel and my doctor's degree
People always say ""Yo, Doc, heal me
'Cause I'm feeling some pain in the artery""
And what I prescribe for you to do
Is to come to our show and I'll rock it out of you
With def rap funky beats
That's fully equipped, no incompletes
'Cause I'm flowing through your veins
Takin' over your body and your brains
And I'm makin' you feel weak
Saying ""Doctor Ice"" every time you speak
'Cause I vaccinate this rhyme into your body
I'm picking up the pace and I'm rockin' the party
For a crowd like this, I got to get sweaty
'Cause when I grab the mic, it seems you're always ready
But, in due respect, not dissin' you
You all know as well as I do
Whether you rock or not today
The Doc gets paid anyway
(Yo, Kangol)
(Yo, Kangol)
(Kangol, let's go)

Well, there's a lot of perpetrating MCs on earth
They didn't start now, they was doing it at first
When they heard Kangol Kid was my name
They said ""Hey, that's fresh. I'll do the same!""
Got their hair in curls, and they brushed it back
And after that, they went and bought a Kangol hat
They bought a black one, a white one, and then a blue
Then they put it to the side, just like I do
When I saw this, I really wasn't surprised
They saw Kangol and they were Kangol-ized
They started Kangol-ism, so they Kang-along
Since it was Kangol-iscious, they said nothing's wrong
They want to be Kangol-ian, but we all know
There's only on Kangaloid and that's me, Kangol
To be in this Kangol-ation you've got to pass
A disease call Kangol-itis and it's spreading fast
You may think that I'm lying or telling you a story
But you can look it up in your Kangol-ory
Kangol-ate it, and get your story down straight
And if you're aggravated, it's 'cause you made a mistake
'Cause, as you see, Kangol-ese is part of life
So, yo, Kan-girl, wanna be my wife?
I played it for my father, my father said ""Stop it!""
I played it for my mother, and my mother said ""Rock it!""
Told my brothers and sisters, they said ""Let it ride""
So as you all know, we jumped on my mother's side
And we rocked it all night, we rocked it all day
My father didn't like it, but we did it anyway
He said ""Stop that scratching, you're causing a disaster!""
I said ""But dad, it's the Mix Master!""
We gonna rock you right now because...",https://genius.com/Utfo-kangol-and-doc-lyrics

Mix Master Ice, pick up the pace

A lot of MCs stood in our way
That's why they're not here to tell it today
'Cause we totally demolished every inch of remembrance
They left behind
If he exists, there's now no sign
Of the sucker MC that could not rhyme
Because nobody but us runs the rap race
So, Mix Master Ice, pick up the pace

The atmospheric pressure will increase
When I say a rap that I have to release
To the population it's out of a club
And this consummated with the aid of dub
The version on the record I call the instrumental
While I take the microphone and toy with the mental
There isn't a rapper I can't erase
Mix Master Ice, pick up the pace

I don't know if I'm right, tell me is this true
Am I the best thing that ever happened to you?
I don't wanna hear ""Nada"", don't me ""No""
I'm not kidding, I'm Kangol!
Do you remember me, remember we was at a party?
And we was dancin' close, and you was feelin' up my body
And you said that you loved me, and you wouldn't love another
I'm sorry, girl, that wasn't you, that was your mother
Mix Master, pick up the pace
Stop, and let's change the track
Yo, Full Force, bring the beat back
But, make it worth my while
And bring it back reggae style

Bad Luck Barry,Skeezer Pleezer,UnKnown,"Bad Luck Barry
Bad Luck Barry

Let me tell you a story about a friend of mine
The boy had terrible luck all the time
You know, the boy was goin' crazy, he was goin' berserk
'Cause everything he tried to do, it would not work
'Cause he's (Bad Luck Barry)
Who is he? (Bad Luck Barry)
Example
Goin' to the store to buy some tea and honey
Barry went into the store and forgot the money
Ran to get the money and without a doubt
My man knucklehead got locked out
And when he finally got in, he got the money I suppose
Ran back, and the store was closed
'Cause he's (Bad Luck Barry)
Who is he? (Bad Luck Barry)
Example
Remember the time he had a sho' 'nuff winner
Invited the girl to his crib for dinner
Had a steak in the oven for this girl named Dawn
Got to the crib and forgot to turn in on
I know you're all saying you hung out with this worm
The reason why? 'Cause his sister was firm
He went to a club he never heard of before
He wanted to get loose on the dance floor
He slipped and slided into his dance
A sound went 
rip
, he split his pants
He bought some def shoes from DeLancey Street
And when he put 'em on, they were two left feet
He got a watch for a present, oh, what a surprise
The watch ticks counterclockwise
I remember the time we double dated
My girl came but he waited and waited
When she waddled in, she moved slow as molasses
I bet she couldn't see him with her bulletproof glasses
When we finally went out, he said ""Good, at last""
And while we was eating, she had to pass gas
(Bad Luck Barry)
Who is he? (Bad Luck Barry)
Break it down
Don't you feel sorry for Bad Luck Barry?
I said don't you feel sorry for Bad Luck Barry?

Well, did you know long ago when Barry was born
Though Barry survived, everyone thought he was gone?
When I say ""gone"", I mean they thought he was dead
'Cause when the doctor said ""Push"", Barry fell on his head
The injury was minor, they thought it was worse
And ever since that day he was eternally cursed
As the years went by the curse didn't retire
His birthday came around and his cake caught on fire
The flames caught on and everything got hot
And that house they called a home is now a parking lot
(Bad Luck Barry)
Who is he? (Bad Luck Barry)
Barry's bad luck had so many segments
He never had sex 'cause thought he'd get pregnant
So he just said ""Forget it"", and decided to chill
'Til his mother put him on the birth control pill
He tried to take a lady's pocketbook and run
He pulled out a knife, so she pulled out a gun
He said that he was sorry so she wouldn't get mad
Then the lady robbed Barry for all he had
Later on, he took this girl to the discotheque
He was looking alright, but she was more like a pet
Then the bodyguard stepped into the middle of the crowd
Said ""Barry, you can stay, but no pets allowed""
(Bad Luck Barry)
Who is he? (Bad Luck Barry)
Havin' bad luck's no good for your health
'Cause one day Barry said ""I'm gonna kill myself""
Put a gun to his head, fully at his risk
Pulled the trigger, BANG, and Barry missed
His luck's so bad, he can't commit suicide
He lived, but the person next to him died
He's the worst there is, and there ain't no doubt
And if you think that's bad then check this out
He never kissed a girl without gettin' slapped
Any mirror he looks into will crack
I once told him that world wasn't round, it's flat
He looked at me and said, ""Man, I've been there and back""
You can break someone's heart if you get in thick
But you can't show an old dog new tricks
If you said ""Watch your step"", Barry, he would fall
In other words, he has no hope at all

Just Watch,Skeezer Pleezer,UnKnown,"I saw this fine fly girl on the train today
I didn't know where she was going, but I followed anyway
She was leathered down back in the back
Umph, what an aphrodisiac
She had muscle-bound thighs, her calves were bad
She had forearms that would make Popeye mad
She had long brown hair, light brown eyes
Innocently attracting all the guys
I tried to speak, but what could it be?
With a body lookin' at me like ""Huh, talk to me""
Just watch, I'm gonna get that girl, just watch
Just watch, I'm gonna get that girl, just watch
So as she...
Got off the train I tried to score
While she go in and out of different stores
So I decided to myself I know I can
And when I went to do it, she came out with her man
He looked at me as if he wanted to break my head
But under my breath you know what I said?
Just watch, I'm gonna get your girl, just watch
Just watch, I'm gonna get your girl, just watch
Then I...
Saw the fly girl, yes, the very next day
Then I told her the deal about yesterday
How I was lost for words and had nothin' to say
I said ""I'm sorry"", she said ""That's OK""
So we conversated and walked
I got straight to the point as we talked
I said ""Your man, now what's up with that?""
She said ""Paul? Oh, well he's a pussycat""
So I thought the coast was clear for the Doc
And then who did we see comin' up the block?
I said ""Your man. Yo, you got him in check?""
She said ""Yeah"", then he grabbed me by my neck
Picked me off the floor and dropped me on my head
And with a knot on my head, you know what I said?
Just watch, I'm gonna get your girl, just watch
Just watch, I'm gonna get your girl, just watch
Then he...
Grabbed me again and she started to say
""Won't you just leave, Paul. Get away!""
And then she picked me off the ground, I said ""If I may...""
Looked him in his face just to say
What'd I tell you, I got your girl, what'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you, I got your girl, what'd I tell you?
As we left he said
Just watch, I'm gonna kill that dude, just watch
Just watch, that dude is through, just watch
And yo...
I don't trust the brother 'cause the boy looks hard
That's why I walk around now with a bodyguard

Years ago before I started wearing a hat
People thought that I was good, but I was really a rat
I was the first, the worst kid you ever saw
And wasn't nothing like gettin' in trouble, y'all
It was all about me and this guy from uptown
His name was Holiday and he was always down
To rob any liquor store that came his way
And after coming off, he'd always say
Just watch, I'm gonna do it again, just watch
Just watch, I'm gonna do it again, ya just watch
I remember in the winter he said ""Nevermind
Forget the liquor stores, it's sheepskin time!""
In school the kids adored him
'Cause he was gettin' coats like they bought it for him
As time went on then 
Spring came along and he was at it again
He saw a leather jacket, he said ""It's gotta be mine""
Then he said ""Forget the jacket, it's sneaker time!""
He came to my house, said ""Yo, my man
I got a truck full of sneakers, wanna give me a hand?""
But when I noticed he was nothing but trouble grown
I said ""I ain't down wit' it, you're on your own""
Just watch, you're gonna get it, black, just watch
Just watch, you're gonna get it, black, just watch
He said ""It's cool with me, if it's cool with you
Excuse me, holmes, I got work to do""
So he left my crib with stolen property and gear
And he's still robbing people from what I hear
I also heard he's wearing gold with fresh designs
He must've said ""Forget the sneakers, it's nameplate time!""
All through the summer, snatching gold chains
And takin' umbrellas when it rains
He's a crook, a liar, a thief, a hood
And when they get him, they gonna get him good
Just watch, you're gonna get yours, just watch
Just watch, you're gonna get yours, just watch
Anything he wore he never bought
He's my boy and everything, but he's gonna get caught
One day he went outside and stole
A pair of Cazals that wasn't gold
I thought he'd be mad, but he didn't care
'Cause he stole another pair
The kids told his parents, they called the cops
The cops came along and Holiday got knocked
He knew it was the end of all his crime
And the neighborhood screamed ""It's Rikers time""
Just watch, they're gonna get your tail, just watch
Just watch, while you're in jail, just watch
Watch!
Umph, what an aphrodisiac
I'm gonna do it again

Where Did You Go?,Skeezer Pleezer,UnKnown,"We're here!
To stay!
So clap your hands this way
'Cause we're gonna rock if you like it or not
When I called you this mornin'
You said that you were comin'
I waited all day for you
Called you back but you weren't home
I needed a romancer
Called again and I got no answer
You know how jealous I can get
So, girl, were you alone?
See me, I started drinking
Sat down and started thinking
She might be chillin' at her sister's house
Just waiting for me
I dialed the number and it started hummin'
I thought good news was comin'
Her phone kept ringing' up to 30 times or maybe 40
I was just wonderin', were you alone? (Alone)
I felt uncomfortable when you weren't home (You were not home)
Ooo, baby, so tell me
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go?
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go?

Everyday you say you love me, and you tell me to call
But you don't really love me, you don't love me at all
I call and leave the messages that you never get
You're determined to be a real pain in the neck
I know when we're together we have nothing but fun
It's not why you do it, baby, it's the way that it's done
Over and over, again and again
You always beat around the bush about where you've been
And as long as my title is ""Yo, Kangol""
I'll die before I let you go
I mean, why all the secrets, it's just not fair
I'm not being nosy, girl, I care
So tell me that you love me, and mean it this time
 in the back of my mind

First, let me tell you what ya put me through
You said you was comin', say here's what I do:
Dim the lights, put on the satin sheets
Broke out the champagne and the candy sweets
And since you left it at my house, I thought it was OK
To lay out red and white negligee
And me, myself, I thought it was no sin
To slip into something comfortable, like my skin
But instead I was polite and put on the silk robe
And after all of this, my baby never showed
After doing all of this I was proud of myself
You didn't come so I was tempted to call someone else
Why don't you tell me that you love me and mean it this time?
 in the back of my mind
I was just wonderin', were you alone?
I felt uncomfortable when you weren't home (You were not home)
Ooo, baby, so tell me
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go? (Where did my girl go?)
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go?
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go? (Where did my girl go?)
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go?
It's hard to love you, baby
I swear you drive me crazy
I'm giving you my all
And in return, you break my heart
Girl, deep inside you love me
So why is it hard to show me?
If you would take my calls
Remember, baby, that's a start
I was just wonderin', were you alone? (Alone)
I felt uncomfortable when you weren't home (You were not home)
Ooo, baby, so tell me
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go?
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go?
Whe-e-e-e-e-ere did you go? (Where did my girl go?)

Some people think rap is a waste of time
But we work hard to build this thing called rap

So, uh, what's the difference from a singer and me?
Ya see, a rapper goes ""ROUGH"" and a signer goes ""Heeeeeeeee""
To make rap, you can't be playin'

You're just mackin' brothers like us know how to rock it
See, it's not the music, it's how you project it
People like you have to learn how to accept it
It's a talent, not a crime, that's why we rock it in our prime
But people always say it ain't worth the time
I never down a singer 'cause I love the way they sing

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
