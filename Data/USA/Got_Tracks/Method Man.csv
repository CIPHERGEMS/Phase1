Bring Da Pain,Tical,1994.0,"Basically...
Can't fuck with me

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental, based on instrumental
Records, hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggas is decaf, I stick 'em for the CREAM
Check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Colour clothes, you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who da boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin' for the head piece, protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin' niggas files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, driving Miss Daisy (yeah)
Out her fucking mind, now I got mine, I'm Swayze (yeah)

Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (yeah)
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real (what, yeah)
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one (what, uhh)
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real—yeah—, uh

When I was a likle stereo (Stereo)
I listen to some Cham-pi-on (Champion)
I always wonda (wondered)
When I will be di numba one (Ticaaal! hahaha)
And now yuh listen to di Gorgon (Gorgon)
And a Gorgon sound a Rein
An' any jump and come tes' mi (test me)
Mi a-go lick out dem brain (it’s like that)

Brothers want to hang with the Meth, bring the rope
The only way you'll hang is by the neck, Nigga Bolt
Off the set, comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga, you can bet your bottom dollar, hey, I bomb shit
And it's gonna get, even worse, word to God
It's the Wu, comin' through stickin' niggas for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw, Mr. Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test, realize you're no contest
Son, I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four-
Nine-three-eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it, 'cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh, vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me, ayy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need no chemical blow to pull a ho
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, '94 style 
Word up, we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you (horn)

Is it real, son, is it really real, son? (motherfucker)
Let me know it's real, son, if it's really real
Something I could feel, son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal, son, if it's really real

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel at some staircase, piss
I'll fuckin' cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin' but sleepin' pills 
Get yours, motherfucker
So—So fuck the ho, fuck the ho
Look at this nigga, this motherfucker, shit",https://genius.com/Method-man-bring-da-pain-lyrics

You would rub me on my back and say, ""Baby, it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me, baby
Never ever give my pussy away
And keep it tight, aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be living in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to fuck with me
But you did, now I'm going all out, kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real with you

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own

Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Rocking three-fourths of cloth
Never showing your stuff off, boo

I can be your Knower, you can be my Wiz
Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the God through birth

Built for This,The Man With the Iron Fists (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2012.0,"Sort of like Malcolm at the Audubon
They coming for me, time is money no Audemar
See bar-for-bar, I keep it pushing no R&R
No foreign broads and no promotion for foreign cars
The game is ours, let’s keep it funky who said he was
Like Staten Island, Italians bleed spaghetti sauce
If y'all ain't shaking or stacking than y'all already lost
Already cross the light, Christ I'm ready for em
Plus anybody that saying no, I’m taking numbers
I’m taking names, I’ll take your chain take this hunger
Pain, pain, pain
Then you feel the thunder and rain I don’t talk it like the rainbow
I get it done and the game y’all
Do me a favor, don’t ever play with my ball
Never been a player-hater I just ain't playing with y'all
You watching lame but look I’m taking the charge
Going hard will get you two shots now I’m facing the charge

Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side

Sort of like Mike at the United Center
Madison Square, Boston Garden I straight ignite on niggas
Lil' nigga your raps ain’t no fire, that shit’ll collapse so don’t try
I scribble and scratch down in my pad that no lie
That no fake, that uncut, that straight drop, what the fuck
I’m pulled over by the jakes, a twenty-eight up in my nuts
For em took away in cuffs I’d rather lay up in the dust
Feel like fuck a friend a hundred million haters ain’t enough
Twist it up
Life is a blunt and the world is my ash tray
I got them quarters and them halves just meet me like halfway
And I need a hundred percent of my profit ain't fucking with half pay
Ain't taking no shorts or losses bitch we ain't fronting no tag day
As I can recollect, praying to God this dope’ll stretch
Turn mobster warners, work these corners like P90X
Chilling and waiting, patient retaliation just ain't find me yet
I’ll take it into Heaven, you couldn’t buy me that, remind me that

Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side

It's the world’s worst, quick to snatch your man purse
And leave your body head first in the stretched hearse
Murder she wrote, I’m known to spit a killer verse
And leave a player blood spilling on his linen shirt
You can Google my name but you ain't gotta search
I’m right here in the streets, I'm putting in work
Go ahead, fuck around and get your feelings hurt
Or, you can get carried outta your local church
I’m from the old school, I do my own dirt
Mama raised no fool, I did my own work
Keep your wifey close, she’s a little flirt
I knew her since '03, I hit the bitch first
I’m the reason why your baby mama water burst
I’ve been marvelous since birth, you can ask my Earth
It’s not a problem to show you how the shotty work
I put your body in the dirt, but what the dollars worth

Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side
Fire up the la let’s go take a ride
They might catch you by surprise if you let em slide
But if you’re built for this shit then you might survive
Guess I’ll see you when you wake up on the other side",https://genius.com/Method-man-built-for-this-lyrics
Release Yo’ Delf,Tical,1994.0," (x2)
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long

Check it, I'm the fucking man, who they mention
Noticed that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo compared to this versatile voodoo
Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, cause I be that hell sure provider
Providing the rhyme that be deep as The Poseidon Adventure
Niggas need to test they freaking tincture
For the sickness that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemy
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, coursing through your town street vicinity
Blunt smoke in the air reveals my identity

(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it moving, we keep it moving, uh
Keep it moving, and keep it moving, uh
Keep it moving, baby, we be moving, uh
Keep it moving, we keep it—huh, rhahhrh!

What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

My God, somebody said, it's on—if it is, then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up with my five fingers of death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand if you fronting
On any man down with the Clan, I be coming
For the headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial killer style from the Isles of Stat'
My peoples are you with me, where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin' all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got their finger on the trigger of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked when I start to kick it
Eat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mistic
Better yet a Snapple
Nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
So we're trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple I'm coming to your town black down
The rental car, the pistol cocked
If you don't want to burn from the Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what?
The buck stops here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who?

What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people getting down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

My rap flow does you right Tical
And it will never steer you wrong

Throw your hands in the sky
And wave them from side to side
And if you’re ready to spark up the Meth Tical

Guns be clicking, running with my clan we be sticking

Tearing up the power-u, Meth-Tical
A bad motherfucking buddah monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbing on my knob like an all day sucker
Bitch!

Meth Vs. Chef
Meth Vs. Chef (Let's bring this shit)
Meth Vs. Chef (Yeah, one more time!)
Meth Vs. Chef
I blow your fuckin ass to death

I'm goin all out kid no turnbacks
You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black rugged
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, making bundles
Niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowin
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop
No question, cha-cha-BOW in the session
Bloodshot in that direction, cypher
Attack you like chess moves best move
Yo, yeah, yo
The boards, your ass
'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uh!
Attack the boards like chess moves, best move
At Rae through, comin at your motherfuckin crew
Live direct, yeah you better step
Gunshots ring on the set
Let's jet - motivate, to the gate
With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle
Airwaves, yo behave
Now you're a slave with the boots that paved the way",https://genius.com/Method-man-meth-vs-chef-lyrics

Say,4:21... The Day After,2006.0,"Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed and started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs and started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets
, 
we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was clan in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed and lost they feel, fo' real

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say

Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them crabs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time they learned what's hot really is and really is not
Off-brand niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on DVDs, trying to show off Glocks
I can't stop 'cause my enemies plot, or 
'cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes, sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say

Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, slingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find
A new nerve and here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride, jerk my vibe
More than media lies, cry when dirt dog die, nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
'Cause 
Tical
, 
he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow y'all find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, 
they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, 
until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say",https://genius.com/Method-man-say-lyrics
Straight Gutta,The Meth Lab,2015.0,"I’m from the killa killa hill, we keep it real consistent
For that dollar dollar bill, we will murder you in an instant
Fuck what your name is, you’ll be non-existent
If you ever try to show any form of resistance
I’m strong in the hood. I’m in a good position
When I walk they salute, when I talk they all listen
You acting the part like you in an audition
Where shoot out’s in the parks is a daily tradition
This is modern warfare, we play with live ammunition
Shot you through your third eye, will change your whole disposition
The body never lie, call me the mortician
Every death has a story to tell, so pay attention
Premonitions on my life, slip the banana clip in
Never put your hat on the bed, I’m a little superstitious
Got my black suit on, they say I am acting suspicious
Big gun in my palm, look like my arm is missing
 (x2)
Ayo one MC two MC
When my gun out, everybody goes down
Word on the street, these boys get butter
Fuck with me, nigga, cause this straight gutta

Got my black suit on, we get malicious
Hanz On checking in for the squad, he on his pivot
Got them big guns, make ‘em disappear, call ‘em wizards
Will oblige, till you meet your demise, this shit is physics
Mr. Barka newest gee on the block, he is the shizit
Suffer Mossberg wounds to ya frame, you move a smidgen
Hanz rollin with the man he the Meth, pay you a visit
Prerequisite have them all in the dirt. They all can get it
Used to percolate the crack in the pot, until it dried
Now I am occupying spots on your block, that shit is aye
And when we popping off the gun at your top, we make it pie
You better take another look at your seeds, and holla bye
Yo as far as ma’fuckas concerned, yo this is it
John Blaze press a button on dudes, they getting hit
As far as guns & that street shit go, my niggas fit
Hanz on with the cavalry yo, we in the mix
 (x2)
Ayo one MC two MC
When my gun out, everybody goes down
Word on the street, these boys get butter
Fuck with me, nigga, cause this straight gutta

I got 28 38’s 48 machine guns
Wu-Tang recon, check out the retard
I want that boat money carrying my green card
Caesar planet of the grapes in the weed jar
I'm straight gutta, mind on butta
Everything dirty wear a rubber for the come up
Block nigga shine like a 5D shutta
Red, Hanz & Street run this mother

We getting beaucoup scrilla
My brothers on their grind
Not another Columbine call me new school killa
Scoop of French vanilla brought a duce duce with her
I might pull a Lil Jon and let the bruce bruce hit her
I’ll be gone till November gon' cry me a river
You could die, but I figure I’ma try and be the bigger man
I and my gorillas, they gonna fry em up for dinner
Like them boys from Cypress Hill said (how I could just kill a man)

If Time Is Money (Fly Navigation),The Saga Continues,2017.0,"Uh, yeah
Choose a side

Look, vibe with me
Rhyme is tricky, who ridin' with me
Who kinda miss me can kindly miss me, you kinda iffy
Don't know the history? I'm from the city of stop-and-frisk me
The cops is jiggy, they spot the blickey then try and get me
My pops a Willie, said ""Give her fifty, she pop her kitty""
He Bad Boy and he Poppa really, it's not a Biggie
See my committee, block offici', it's not an ishy
Or I'm too lazy to cross roads, if not, I'm busy
It's not a mystery who shot Ricky, but where the difference
Between the tré and the dough boy, we bred different
So bear witness, this can leave you with head missing
If y'all can hear me, I guarantee you the feds listening
So I be spittin' in barcode, nothin' left in the tap, dog
And after the last call, the bar close
This my Cohiba, cigar blow
Even Tony Stark knows the tension is thick as Wallabee Clark soles
But did I mention I'm sick and gotta be hardcore
Hard-boiled, taking your base, that's what we ball for
Money over bimbos, that's what the Mob for
Rappers stuck in limbo 'cause they were settin' the bar low
Every time I rhyme on a track, it's like a convo
King, we put the nine to your back, it's like you Rondo
When it come to John, though, I'ma slaughter a John Doe
Drag him through a drive-thru like he ordered the combo
Hands on him, we wild style with the cans on him
Then come defeat, that's my beliefs and I stand on 'em
Give you the beats, no Doc Dre or brands on 'em
Some men want 'em, these verses hot and the fans want 'em
I'm from the school of them hard knocks with harder standards
I've been a hard rock before they added the Arm & Hammers
My meth bananas, bogus method, we call it bama
Gun on the camera so we can shoot them in panoramas
Na-nana-nana, I'm feelin' petty, but watch your manners
Use proper grammar so we could stop with the propaganda
No type of slander but tell them hoes, ""I'm not your Santa""
Just want the body, nobody tryin' to pot-and-pan ya
Cop scanners, 
a fuller house but we not the Tanners
If shooters bringin' them Hawks out, then it's not Atlanta's

If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
Nobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made
If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
Nobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made

Choose a side
Math vs Meth, Cival War

If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade
Nobody get 'til I got mine, my mind made
If time is money, I got time and time saved
I pull your blinds and stop shine behind shade

Mr. Sandman,Tical,1994.0,"[Intro: RZA & 
Blue Raspberry
]
This is 
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Serious, the craziest, da-da
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Day-da, danger, dangerous style

Lyrical shots from the Glock
Bust bullet holes on the charts
I want the number one spot
What's the science? I'm a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, occurred when I slammed in
Program the jams to be fat as Ralph Kramden
Others come with shit as silly as Art Carney
But my technique tranquilizes more kids than Barney
Remedy for stress is three bags of sess
A day at my rest playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't looking, I take the queen with the rook then
I get vexed, laying phat tracks on Ampex
Puffing skunk, getting drunk off of Triple X
Ballantine, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck & 
Method Man
]
My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leaving mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I grip your style like a spasm
Drag 'em through the mud then I bag 'em
We're screaming hardcore, 
hip-hop drips out my pores
And I be raw
, 
for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
Like jail, 
electrifying like the third rail
Beats are smashed with paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang! 
Clan ain't nothin' to fuck wit'

Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, 
on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin', listen
Enemy is the industry got me flippin'
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and her nigga
I'm killin', snipin', catchin' murder cases
Desert Stormin'
, I be searchin' for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin', swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the four nine three eleven
[Chorus: Method Man & 
Blue Raspberry
]
Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream
I don't know what's going on, if you can take us there

Yo, watch me bang the headpiece, there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
Murder, 
underground beef for the burger
P.L.O.
, criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, 
runnin' through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggas best to be careful crossin'
The street, before they end up layin' in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggas tend to forget, however
Peep this — my nigga Kase lives forever

What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the Shadow, street-life, flowing again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kick would knock the hinges off the door
The dread tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tech
Just when I said, ""Where the fuck's the cream?""
Another dread came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast three shots like rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you, God!) but I dodged it
Niggas said, ""Carlton you'se a ill motherfucker""
'Cause I made it look like they both killed each other
And I'm out

Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream

Are you ready, to face the consequences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker

Bet you thought you fucking clan had ya back but they was fronting
Smoking dirt blunts and fucking nasty sluts and
You just a naked gun without the bullet, what you busting
Get your ship sunken, fucking with a drunken

Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, that ave
Whatever, smoking on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hoping niggas get the point
Cause they could never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severing the head of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weed gate, with a long line of credit
If you desire fire, I be the first to set it
Off, flame on like the Human Torch

And a Playboy bunny that can cook, nigga

Sweet Love,Tical 2000: Judgement Day,1998.0,"Excuse me gorgeous..

Just maxing, looking for hoes, y'know, relaxing
Met this redbone Jasmine, midtown Manhattan
Shot a verb, that tranked her nerves, calm words
Massaged the mentals, made her pussycat purr
Sweet Love you look miraculous, brown-eyed passionate
High cheek-boned, Tommy Girl cologne you smashing it
Jump in, take a spin, destination Staten
I have you home by ten, shorty started laughing
She replied, ""Street, you ever ride while you drive?""
I looked puzzled, and said, ""Nah baby, why?""
She pressed up, grabbed my dick, threw her dress up
Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up
Now I'm deep in it, flying past the speed limit
Out of control, still whipping it, steadily hitting it
Deep stroking, one hand on the wheel, blunt smoking
Loving how it feel, sweet Love you got me open, what?

Love is love, love, love is love, love
Love is love, love, love is love, love
We connected like a train from the first ordeal
I stepped to her with the passion as I kept things real
But like, sex was on my mind like, cum was in my pants
I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""
I said, ""Yeah, mad gear plus the small white band
Sweet Love, I want your pussy can I be your man?
Stripped to the bare essentials let me fuck you if I can
Sweet Love, from your nipples to your pussy nub""
Sweet Love, love is Love, love is love Love

It's a full moon, we in the bedroom
Thoughts consumed by the passion
Slow jam tunes and body action
My finger's on the clit splashing
Your pussy lips got you spazzing
Love juices, marinating in your satins
Sexy ass, I gets 'em like my old dad I love my women bad
With just a little touch of class
You'se the star by far, look at you ma
Shake your thang-thang girlfriend, you 
cherchez la femme
Whattup, went to beat it up, I'm not the one to eat it up
But the type to hit it raw dawg and seed it up
We talk without sayin nuttin'
You told me if I came through you'd gimme som'thin'
Now we locking ass, pulling hair and talking trash
How you like it, slow or fast?
She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea
Candidate for H.I.V, you'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're 'bout to bust damn it
Sugar walls coming down, now you can't stand it
You've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Getting closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts",https://genius.com/Method-man-sweet-love-lyrics

Formula to go triple -- for shizzle
Y'all know my occupation, I'm puttin' in the work
So any imitation, I'm puttin' in the dirt
That shit is aggravatin', why y'all procrastinatin'
I got some massive waitin', and she probably masturbatin'
Welcome to New Yitty, where half is two fifty
If I got a problem, then that's one problem too many
So don't tempt me, I'll bust until I'm empty

Cook it once the griddle gets so hot, good lookin' kid
Ok, now where was I? Prepared, was I
Your man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on this mic, not a day in your life, could ya
Say I ain't nice, could ya? If I ain't nice, would ya?
Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come her

Can hear me ""cummin'"" like my dick's in her ear or somethin'
I put that on my momma, she put that on her kids
He put that chrome on your dome and blowed ya fuckin' wig

The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wu’s up, Ws up
If you ain’t with us, chuck a duce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Let’s see if they can hang, I’m already tying the noose up
I’m too hot, if you not, get you stuffed
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut
Young buck I’m just trying to toughen you up
Can’t let you hustle with us, ya ain’t struggled enough
Y’all been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I ain’t saying I’m perfect
I ain’t cursing on the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that proMeth and a soda, come with the purchase

Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to Chef tho, but still trend
My young’un tell em it’s them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em’ again
Wu-Tang is for the children

Lab with the pole, slide down, I’m in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestaks
HSBC see me getting g-packs, herringbones mad stones in em’
The voice is olive green, three doors I’m on bring my goons home
Puma’s on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me, just sue me homes
Yea Half Mike half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkey’s out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably be the way we be rolling
Let’s cash a check y’all bring the broads here
Until the sun burns out, ain’t nobody eating
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

I’m still buzzing this is Hennessey the next morning
The upset talking, I’m yes y'allin for cheques
Bossin’ the set, you acting like my ex calling
Ain’t that a bitch, not the 5 or the 6
I rock 7 on my back that’s Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion I ain’t having it
S I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, what’s happening
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting

Hahahaha.. yeah..

Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
One verse, and leave in a new Benz vert
Take a trip down south and put some hoes to work, you hear me
Dirt McGirt, you niggas gon' respect it
I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump, and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out, and laugh about it in Texas, yo
And get with Rome, down in 
Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at
Where the shootin' and the fightings and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys and the Cadi's at, shit
Them down south niggas been loved Dirt
Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse
Show respect to your niggas, who been doin' it first
And be comin' with that shit, I'm just doin' the worse

Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit

Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit)

I'm the truth, I don't need to go to church in a suit
Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof
Cop searching the coup,
 
I got some herb in my boot
When Wu is coming through, the outcome: critical
Fucking with this style, the outcome: get physical
Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my genitals
Don't forget them 8 essentials, vitamins & minerals
Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team
Like Martin Luther King, taking one for a dream
I'm dope, to many fiends, live by many means
If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything
That's real shit, let's get this money real quick
Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this, but I'd rather feel rich
I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now

This is my own private domicile
I will not be harassed, motherfucker!

Welcome to the Meth Lab, listen, it's time to cook
Not confessions of a video vixen, we by the book
Start the fire, I can tell what you thinkin' just by a look
I'm a crook, like some fish in a barrel, I got 'em hooked
Blame the Method, your sanity took, go 'head, admit it
You a meth head that live on the edge, just need a push
I'm your pusher, supplier, I'm back, the cheese on the wire
If a snitch burnin', wouldn't even piss on the fire
Now you kids learnin', I ain't tryin' to preach to the choir
Now the kids earnin' like them dealers that he admire
Got that whip workin' like I'm sacrificin' a virgin
That's a burden, but I'm certain you're feelin' it, after you try
You can't deny I cook a batch like, 'Woo'
Hazardous material, you'd need a hazmat suit
Now you lookin' at me like, 'What's a hazmat suit?'
Somethin' used to move a body, you don't have that loop

Let's talk about trust
I told you not to cook my recipe
And you went ahead and did it anyway
Cause I never said I wouldn't cook it
Cause it ain't yours, it's ours, bitch

Hookers in the kitchen, chemistry is the best recipe
Especially this shit, I'm takin' on bets
Pressure cookers, percolate 'em like chefs
Meth labs here to the West, wools on them gear trims grassed
Mr. Barker, General, front and center (What up?)
Got them burners wit' them bodies on them, have me in cuffs
Killer's focused, slam it up in them trucks
Eyes low, grippin' the toast, trigger finger, playin' it close
You think it's a game? It's imperative, we show 'em we live
These niggas playin' wit' this money, funny how niggas die
They say it's over when the fat kid cry, ratchets fly here to the Chi'

You think you can stop me from cookin'?
You cook whatever you like, as long it's that B work
These niggas be runnin' around in the street wit' everyday
Don't even think about usin' my grade A
You should try and stop me, bitch

I'm in the meth lab concoctin' another concoction
Decisions, decisions, just weighin' my options
The formula highly addictive, it's habit forming
Side effects life-threatenin', the surgeon's warnin'
I write a prescription just for meth abusers
Regulate your dose intake for heavy users
For generations, I been servin' these rap fiends
Babies born addicted to the metric, know what I mean?
You're recoverin', but you still use frequently
So wet your court hearin', judge show some leniency
Can't escape old habits, so you copy the new shit
Wit' your kids in your cars, see, pumpin' that Wu shit
We worldwide, supply and demand, I got the upper-hand
Check my passport, global support
Informant lands non-commercial goods, that raw and uncut
That got them breakin' bad at the gate for the re-up

What up, Street?
Yo, what up, man?
We gon' put some ""Welcome to the meth lab"" on there
Man, you know, it's straight gutter shit, nigga
Yeah, you ready to get 'em this time?

Now pay attention, the big D-O double to the G-O
To the liquor store to crack a ho and get some VO (VO)
And mix it with some pena colidino
Then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c-notes
Scandalous, yep bitch cause we know
Every pretty ho always down to pull a d-low

Just to play with these whips and chainsaws? And sharp glass
I'll shine them up real nice, turn them sideways
And shove them up your candy ass

It's Thursday Night Smackdown, there's No Way Out
Now you got a problem, with the Brahma Bull
Time to throw Rock Bottom
Ain't no way to stop him
See the People's Elbow, ignite the crowd
Into a feeding frenzy, they want blood now
Chinlock and chair shots, suplexes, legdrops
Finish with the People's Elbow and sign it Rock

There's not many, who can match up with him""

You know god damn whatever and uhh
It's dumb and big -- it's DUMB AND BIG)
Mira, Meth-Tical comin through with the suu
(Lie in cut for y'all)
Check it out

Niggas wanna test my steez, nigga please
I black that eye like peas, you better freeze
In your tracks, a Wu-Tang (bzzz) killer bee's on ya back
I comes for the honey plus the phat money sack
You want it all? Yeah I want it all like THAT
I stab my own moms in the back for a stack
Niggas like, ""Damn, why you want it like that?"" (Why is that?)
Cause I'm a dog, and I got no love for the cat (uhh)
Attitude's cold like the North polar cap
Where I do my dirt's a little further down the map (Is that so?)
A little buck wilding, Island called Stat'
Where niggas carry gats in they Black Moon hat
Now I'm mad known for the bones and the rap
And you's an unknown with a faulty contract
Wake up and smell the Met-chod motherfucker contact
Villain in the cypher from the foe when head crack
An Indian giver and I'm out to take it back
Shaolin Island, baby where you at?
A runaway train that be runnin on ya track
That's how it's goin down, yeah, it's goin down
I gets my thang in action
To live, to love, to see, to learn
Yo! Tell em what's happenin!
(What's happenin?
I'll tell yo' ass what's happenin
Tell em what's happenin
It's goin on out here - brothers ain't got no peers
And they smokin funny - shuddup yo' damn mouth!)

I swing funky rap routines and tap the jaws
Spot ya twenty points and you still can't score
NUTTIN - cause you ain't got no points in this game
Kid you FRONTIN - I'm home run hittin, you be buntin
Fresh out the toilet, I got my shit together
When I'm good, I'm good, when bad, I'm better
You want it? Whatever - I'll be the stormy weather
Rain comin down, so weatherproof you're leather
JACKET, a nigga with a AXE couldn't HACK IT
I spark em like a match (ssskt)
Coming back it's the Met-chod, say it loud
I'm the Met-chod, Man - clap yo' hands, now check it
See me in the mix, rollin fat, bustin flicks
While my physical brother came through and got me lift
Niggas, that I walk by, give me the eye
The moment is fuckin me up, killin my high
Nigga get back, ya pussy cat, I'm fearsome
Basically THAT, I'm all of THAT, and then some
While I, was out on tour, goin beserk
I heard you was at the sandbox and kickin DIRT
All on my name but you can't pull my file
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, AND YOU DON'T KNOW MY STYLE
Comin out dere like dat dere, YEAHHHH
Even Grizzly Adams couldn't bear
(Ahhheheh, I taught the boy everything he KNOW
Go on you bad motherfuckers
See I told you that kid go back to that Dolemite
Everybody needs to love Dolemite

I’m a Rottweiler, diamond collar with gold fangs
Yep, a top shotter, Don Dada, rhyme proper
Might even take the ‘R’ out of brother—why bother?
Mic on Halloween, I mean, I’m clearly a monster
We gathered here today so that I could dearly depart ya
Math, bars better than Willy Wonka’s
It’s how to get away with a murder—you feel me, Shonda?
Rhymes like karma, I’m hood, stash the contra
You ever hear a rhymer this good, smack ya mamas
But it’s still death over dishonor
‘Cause you can get it next and get death over this drama

Heh... cauli' flavored, momma crack
Yeah... yeah... Scott Storch (Return of the great)
Mr. M-E-F (aww shit) know what I said
Black people don't use the T-H, yo (got it fucked up now)
Yo, yo...

Guess who back though, crack dough, yes, eyes is hat low
Stash 'dro, pimp on the side, you know how that go
Rap flow, major, taste the flavor, all natural high
Y'all gotta love it when the track go (track go)
Ask Def Jam what's hot, three letters, M-E-F Man
Been stopped, that's off top, young, fresh to death
And you're not, no matter what the job, I'm the best man
Rap C.E.O. minus the yes-man (yes-man)
I know that's right, so act right, Staten on the map
Like fuck y'all, get stuck, y'all and have a bad night
As I brush off my shoulder, that's right
My nigga Scott Storch keep bringing it back like (back like)
Oh boy, dig it, I talk about it and I live it
Been there, did it, shitted and wiped my ass with it
These critics saw the train for brains and must of missed it
If they ain't got the shit, they'll never get it (never get it)

Is it me, or is it these, niggas in it for cheese
Is it me, all my enemies, hating on Killa Beez
Is it me, or is it me, that ain't feeling M.C.'s
With the top down, wheeling the v, feeling the breeze
Is it me, or is it these, niggas spitting the same
Is it me, all my enemies, throwing shit in the game
Is it me, or the industry that really got to change
Once again, it's Wu-Tang, in case y'all forgot the name

I spit germ, early bird gets worm, now
Now that it's his turn, clowns don't get turns, now
Fuck with a chick perm, when she get hot, you get burned
You see I'm not kidding, knowing these kids learn (kids learn)
And and I'm that dude, ahh-choo, and allerging to wake jewels
Blast if I have to, and y'all don't give me no hassle
Who rep Rotten Apple to death and get natural
Make hard beats pound like the track do (track do)
If you ask me, this raspy voice nigga is nasty
Khaki's hanging off of his ass, eyes is glassy
That's fucked, that's us, niggas know where to catch me
At 1-800 GET-AT-ME, (get at me)
My, flow's, no holds barred, Holy Jahad
It's the head nigga in charge, Meth, back on the job
Like back in the days, back when, the game was hard
And when they reminiscenced over Wu, my God


Until these rap niggas stepped up, checked up, man this game is messed up
Next up, you know what it is, don't get it f'd up
Meth, what? F.Y.I., you need a heads up
And I don't mean to beat you in the head, but (head, but)
When you spit that, forget that, I eat these niggas food
And the shit wrapped, where Cliff at? Tell 'em Mr. Meth got his shit back
The gift back, sign, sealed, delivered and gift wrapped
And when you hear that click-click (click-click)
That's real talk, some niggas will talk to the cops
Get killed off, man how did you get caught with all the rocks
And still walk, no matter what you mix with a pig
You still pork, and money is still forced (still forced)
Yeah, that was right on cue, new and improved
All these dudes try'nna walk in my shoes, doing my moves
But that's cool, cause I'mma make it do what it do

Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (it's been a long time for this man
Niggas been sleeping on the kid, man, everybody got some sideway shit to say)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (Carlo! Know what I'm saying, man? Yeah)

Fast or slow mo, oh no, Meth d
one made a killing
Call the po-po, oh niggas is squealing, oh, y'all ain't feeling
Niggas no more, the bigger they are, harder they go though
Good pussy put a hump in my back like Quasimoto
Hah, my sex ain't homo, season vet, hold the adobo
Got rappers on that low carb diet, y'all can't get no dough
I keep a low pro, file, excuse me as I get smoked out
Put hands on these niggas, then put the roach out
Go head, I'm wishing you would, ask if it's good
Man, does Tarzan shit in the woods
, my shit is hood, bitch
That means I'm hood rich, telling you lies
Straight out the pull-pit, it's like Merrill Lynch I'm on that bullshit
Real spit, money come first, and even worse
You need all your toes & fingers to count up what I'm worth, trick
So when I blow a smoke cloud in your face, just take a hint
Dick, you crowding my space, it's Mr. Meth, pa

It's 4:20, roll up, nigga getting smo-ked out
No seeds, California weed have you choked out
No doubt, roll up, which rims spoked out
4:

roll up or roll out

Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it

So on and so on, I flow on
Power to our people, get your smoke on
And I'm so gone, off, that sour diesel
Hard to hold on, but hold on, it's like I'm Pretty Toney
With that robe on, got terrorist shook, because I'm so bomb
The hood, put, me in position, I'm in the kitchen
With that cook book, the service I'm giving, birds they vision
Not a good look, told ya my nigga, Tical deliver
Hook or crook, lots of asses to kick, wish I had a bigger foot
Yeah, taking it there, hating who care
Y'all stay out my mental, I got killas waiting in here
To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all niggas is pussy, so is the dick that sent you
RZA, we d
one it again

Here's to short skirts and Ol' Dirt McGirt, okay, then
Let's get it popping, like it ain't nothing to get it popping
The big and rotten's the city, too good to be forgotten

The rap game won't like me
You can tell that a nigga is shiesty
If I die, my second born'll be like me
Slide dick to your wifey
Never know your baby boy just might be
Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill
From the Hill, never ran, never will
Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point
This is not a rap song, you get clapped on
Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name
Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame
Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact
Where you from, is where we at
And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that
Caught your verse for sale, but real niggas don't shoot & tell
We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell

The inner outer state, bi-coastal smoker
Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up
Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow
Shine shine shine, and grind, cuz it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya niggas know what's on my mind
When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up

Crime scene, coppers and sirens
Helicopters and high beams, the tensions is rising
Fiends keeping the pipe clean
This is what life means, a dollar and a dream
Everybody wants nice things
The kid was only nineteen, hole in his chest now
He's fighting, for his last breath
He's seeing death, it's frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening
You try to do the right thing? They do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream, sirens and light beams
Popping off bad shots, hitting people that they ain't mean to pop
The neighborhood’s in shock, block extremely hot
Another Black teen shot, that’s dull routine to cops
Make sure they got good grades, work the minimum wage
Now he’s laying on that stretcher, with nothing in him to save
Keep the ghetto, in whatever ghetto you at
Just don’t love the ghetto, cause the ghetto don’t love you back
You don’t live until you’ve made your first million
And top models wanna have your children
I thought I told you Wu Tang is for the children
Way before rap moved crack in your building
Yeah, now what’s the price of rice in China?
These women trying to raise the price on their vagina
Me? I’m trying to live the life and get the grind up
Like Diddy, but I ain’t trying to give the shine (Shyne) up
Poppa, pop-off no question, ya’ll dirty

like it raw, (no protection)
When the kid hold court, no objection
Meth needed money at the door, no exception
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a pussy no Viagra

Cradle Rock,Tical 2000: Judgement Day,1998.0,"All the children come into the light...
 There will be...

Rock-a-bye baby from the rooftop
When the guns blow, your cradle gets rocked
When the Earth quakes and the sky starts to fall
Down will come MCs, fake shit and all

Off top it be the sure shot, the bomb drops
Aftershock blow your 
bumba claat
 to smithereens
Time stop, flying guillotines coming for your slot
What you mean you spilled the beans, ock
Blacked out and thought I seen Pac, laser beam Glock
What's a bird to a brother with a flock, what?
They got some nerve to even try to shit a turd
On John J, slap a nigga gay with the wordplay
Hot Nix shoot you with the gift, it's your birthday
God hating ugly in the worst way, fuck 'em like the Earth say
From first day I survey the hassle, death knocking at your door
In the Big Apple, Meth rotten to the core
Shackle in the sound castle
The dungeon with vermin in the form of MCs determined
To step foot on God's soil, not knowing that
These eggheads come hard boiled and heavy handed
The aliens they just landed and you in the way
Overthrow these niggas' planet, Independence Day
Felons, get split melons, homicide
Bug niggas get the bug repellent, insecticide
Johnny 5 take it worldwide, as long as I
Pledge allegiance to the Dark Side, I'll never die
Who you know with a flow like this? Bring 'em in
What Clan you know blow like this?
 Bring 'em in
Take that nigga

The sound of gun burst put the foul in the dirt

You can't think clearly from the mind control theory
(Mind control theory)
Murder in the first bring 'em back down to Earth
(Back down to Earth)
Y'all niggas don't hear me prepare for the worst
(Prepare for the worst)

Times gon' change, nothing will remain the same
Million dollar broke niggas still fucked up in the game
Make me wanna choke niggas shitting on my name
Tuck your chain when I approach nigga, go against the grain now
Niggas stand in rain now, 
die hard fan
Call me John John McClain now

Snake vs. the Crane Style
Death to the enemy, 
Wu brother Number One
The Centipede
, troublesome, 
send 'em all to Kingdom Come
Sun still shine one, time for your crooked mind
Drunk off a cheap wine, son I'm into street crime
Every word, every line, got juice very fine
Turn me loose on mankind, detonate the landmine
Focus my goal now, never sell, never sold
Live by the code now, never tell, never told
Darts I throw like Clyde with the finger roll
Clutch shots and what not, this is where the buck stops
Still can't eat and y'all still can't sleep
I elect myself as Presidential MC
Wu-Tang Killa Bee, the beehive facility
In love with the blunt smoke even though it's killing me
Bad vibes filling me with thoughts of conspiracy
White Water scandals with Bill Clinton/Hillary
Too hot to handle, too well put together to dismantle
Fucker, you heard me

Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Catch me when I fall son, I'm too young to die
Me and Lefty, that be the Eye come test me
If you don't know, you never know me
Booster, burn me



I got 360 degrees of self
That's mind, body and spirit
A hundred twenty degrees a piece
We gon' break it down into simple terms
That's nine nigga nine, highest level of change
It's too many niggas sitting on their ass
Waiting for shit to just happen
Shit don't just happen, gonna fuck around a miss a buck
If you take away the negative, make room for the positive
That's adding and subtracting on the real
Niggas better learn their math
Cause if my calculations serve me correct
I'ma fuck around and have all this shit

I'm here for you, son, I gotcha back
As long as you keep it real, word, I gotcha back
Brothers want the drama but don't know how to act
Until the chrome pointed at his dome head crack
Come on, let's keep it real, no disguise, recognize
I'm from a small town where ""nigga do or nigga die""
That's why I'm stressin'
That brothers keep they thoughts on they lesson
Resurrect yo' mind from the essence, for real
Ill block niggas get robbed like by the dozen
What up, cousin? Now give a pound to that lounge nigga
Peace, my MZA! Killah Hills 10304 by the GZA
Got me wideeee, it's goin' DZA
Make my way for the ooh buildin'
Now I'm chillin' with the neighborhood villains
Thug Life, it be on now
Hear the gun blaow as I milk another cow
Let the Method show you how niggas do it
I study, live the life of good, bad and ugly
Hard times caught a nigga lovely, but that ain't nuttin'
Before I die, I'mma leave the world with sumtin'
To remember me by, the real stimuli!
For you frontin' ass out rappers to capture
I rip the world apart like a natural disaster
I keep it live, somethin' born in '85
I utilize my 3rd eye, got me thinkin'
Baby, you and I should get together for whatever
You never in your long-legged life had it better
Than you got it now, we be loungin', Tical

The Riddler,A Taste of Tical O (Part II),1995.0,"Intro:
Dead crosswords puzzling your delf
See that's what I'm talkin bout
When you take the Johnny Blaze
And you take that game and you plug that here into Bobby Steels
Now, you are playing with power
With power
With power

I got your mind twisted
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crossword puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health, yeah, it's like a maze within itself
Yeah, Check the grimey, slimey, crimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy
My crime committee, robbing every Gotham piggy bank blind
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler

Tax free money not a problem
A heist to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
It's The Riddler

Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-it, quiz
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, 
invading brothers wigs
Can I live corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddles
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler

Murder for the evil not a problem
To the gen there is no sequel not a problem
Big up to all my people not a problem
It's the Riddler

Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels
We was blazing hot wheels
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeal
On that ass fast was the Batmobile
I could tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
Trying to escape, code nine with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler

Talking suicide, not a problem
If you're speaking homicide, not a problem
You want to talk genocide not a problem
That's not a problem, for The Riddler

Word up, that's no problem
Stim-ulim-uli, stim-ulim-uli
Feel good don't it
And you know it
Got the, hotter
You're playing... with... power",https://genius.com/Method-man-the-riddler-lyrics
Presidential M.C.,4:21... The Day After,2006.0,"*kung fu fighting*
Yeah, uh, heheheh (That's Shadowboxing!)
Yo...

It's that Blackout, spazzed out, G-String divas
Leave you assed out, passed out, it's cold
Pack your heat up, blow your back out
You bad mouth, make 'em all believers
Throwing rocks from a glass house, y'all ain't perfect either
See that cheeba and that hash out (garbage day tomorrow)
And I have yet to take that trash out, or emptied this cigar
RZA Ra, we amped, eh, Meth is on his job
It ain't nothing, like the French say; ""que sera sera""
So let's move on, until the day we laying in the casket
With them suits on, and I'm so cool that hell is only luke warm
Been too strong, for too, long, I'll probably die
With my boots on, and on my way to cash a coochie coupon
You know I'm, proper, don't let them boys confuse you
The fact is Meth, I'm harder than bottles made by Yoo-Hoo
Wu-Tang, welcome to the House of Flying Daggers
Where the truth aim, flying out the mouth of flying rappers
There it is...

Now, ask yourself, is this for real, it can't be
My, nigga, if it ain't for real, it ain't me
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
Now, ask yourself, why is he so low key
Why, is niggas pimpin' when the game chose me
I, elect myself as presidential M.C
I, elect myself as presidential M.C

Yo, blew 'em and hit 'em, and he went into a spin cycle
Out blew his liver, a river flooded, what's happening
It's drugs we wanted, gloves buttered, thug coverage
This is Fila, white sneaker, Louis Vitton luggage
I came, representative huddle, they all love you
That W, the legacy of little niggas muggin' you
The fuck, what's up with you, yo, you suck, nigga
Benches used to pluck niggas, we be on the roof, like ""fuck you""
Them red beams is coming, losers, got to walk the plank
Users, with uzi's on 'em, you move, you getting spanked
Shank broilers banked, alcoholics ranked ballers
They should call us, I rock mad ice like a walrus
The lamesters decided to lure us, we was up in Freedomtown
Getting weeded, one Bentley tour bus, you might like the mack and explore dust
You can't fuck with all of us, one of us dropped, there's twenty more of us


Peel caps like tangerines, you shook/shake like tamberines
Then, jet from the set, in the all black Lamborghin'
Nobody seen me, bitch in a tini red bikini
Niggas saw her, because they thought they saw a genie
Heidi Klum, pussy juicy, fat as a plum
Picture on the wall in jail, niggas jerk til they come
God gargantuan, large, colossus, bombardment of darts
Make your squad, throw tantrums
Practice karma sutra on broads, pop bra's
Leave birds with permanent scars, and shit like birthmarks
Digi bark back at dogs, snatch flies from frogs
Blow California chronic to despise the smog
This shit I been with biz in the clearing, pigs sharing
Got fresh, Wu-Wearing, motherfuckers not caring
Then move through your community, with diplomat immunity
Move to rep a two or G., shine like fine jewelry

Perfect World,Tical 2000: Judgement Day,1998.0,"First, they dropped the bomb
Then came the disease, then death
This our world, your world, my world
I like this world!

On foreign land keep your toast up, hot rocks
Catch a close up, your snot box broke up
Land shark tryna post up, reptiles
Tryna throw cub with crooked smiles
Take your kindness for weakness, they foul
New York niggas be loving how the gun talk, ""Pow!""
Another underboss pull a doublecross
Niggas ain't ready for the holocaust here and now
Want them games people play, catch these bullets over Broadway
25 to life up in Rahway get caught
Look deep into the black thought
A holy war is being fought on Allah's court
My perfect world (if you will!)

Mr. Sandman bring 'em a dream
Infrared light beams, homicide scene, perfect world
By any means get cream
Just don't let it come between you and I, seen
Everything is everything in this three ringed circus
Peoples is swift, tryna work us Lord
With Devil worship and satanic verses
It takes place in the world perfect, mine and yours

Heard when it rains, it pour
I came to bring the pain once more
Pedal to the floor peep the Jim Crow Law
The Big Apple rotten to the core, these niggas want war?
(Give 'em war)
They scheming and eye-beaming
Hitmen like Crying Freeman, they need cleaning
Keep it coming 'til they all running, screaming
Bloody murder at war with them inner demons, it's going down
Invasion USA, spitting rounds
If these shells hit the battleground
Pave the way for birth of a Generation X
Spoken with a project dialect
Bomb threat to the airwaves, hit the deck
Pressed for time in a world lacking sunshine
Got love for my family cause they mine
See niggas dying in the streets over petty crime
We gon' eat or die trying, got my mind made up
Young buck, just don't give a fuck
Pressing they luck when they best best to give it up
Perfect world, baby, what? Nigga head or gut, them or us
Welcome to the dark ages
Dirty pages of filth, fine filth flavors
Dust to dust and ashes to ashes
Life flashes right before his eyes, then he passes

While the 666 got more tricks than the PD's got bricks
From Bloods and Crips to pimps with mints
We still licking the scars from whips on slave ships

I'm a smoker (Yeah), weed toker
The cola in your coka
Losing change up in your sofa
I brought change into the culture (Uh)
Funny how these pigeons try and change into a vulture
You's a poser, wit' pork all on your fork and that ain't kosher
No sir, I never put a penny in a loafer
For good times up in the ghetto, we had penny and Willona (Uh)
You know I stretch a quarter, got a rock 'cause I'm a roller
And I'm bolder than a hard rock is 'cause I'm a stoner
I need closure (Uh), and you rappers need to wake up
And smell the begonias
You about to be goners
Big shot caller, I'm here to pop them corners
Little league ballers could get popped, I warned ya
Who put the person in persona, putting hands up on a person
Close the curtain on the Rama
Pack a Llama, catch me lurking I'm your karma
Sleeping on me even worse'll get you murked in your pajamas

You can try, but you'll never understand me
I plan to give it to you raw, get a plan B
Y'all be racing to the cash, that's a Grand Prix
I go Ricky Bobby for that bag, that's a guarantee
That's a guarantee
Ricky Bobby for that bag, that's a guarantee

Like a virgin, but I'm certain that this person a piranha
Man eater, Jeffrey Dahmer
If a stray hit a stan and 
kill a fan that's Katana
A rapper getting roasted in a room, that's a sauna
Straps in the room, It's Shaolin vs. the Lama
Why should I threat when I can promise
With that money saved for college
You can go and pay me homage (Yeah)
If you do the knowledge, you would know this I was solid
By the time you check your pockets
I already got ya wallet

I done peeped a lot of cats come through
Courageous cats, stray cats, ha-ha
Top cats with top hats, you know what I'm saying?
But it all boils down to this, we talking lyrics
Rhymes, line for line, numero uno
Who the best? I don't know

Flame on, I rain fire when Johnny Storm

Let them toes get they tag on, dead men run no marathons

On the telethon, running his lips, sinking the ship
Give back what his mother gave him, mother made him
And now she can't even save him, Johnny Blaze 'em
Send him to his final resting
Back to the essence, 
Faces of Death

Torture, torture, torture
Motherfucking torture, y'all niggas know

Who got John Blaze shit? Sucking my dick to get famous
So I switched Blaze to Dangerous
Welcome to my torture chambers, torture chambers
Where John Doe's remain nameless, hear me?
I know it's Def Jam, but think clearly
I made it possible for y'all cats to come near me
Keep your enemies close and your heat closer
I slam just like my culture on all theories
Dead that, straight off the meat rack with this one
You get burned playing 
Nix-on, Hot
 biscuit
Stand back, don't make me spit one and paint pictures
On the walls of your mental with hot lead from out these pencils
Iron Lung since I was young and not knowing
Where the next meal was coming from, been troublesome
To all those posing a threat
If I go, everybody got to go next, y'all niggas know
The code of the street soldier, 
I'm watching time
And time watching me colder,
 Grim Reaper
Breathing death on my shoulder
Waiting for the day to take me over, take me over

Torture, torture, torture
Motherfucking torture, y'all niggas know

That you can never touch my flow, go ahead and hate me
Still tryna fuck my ho, Johnny-come-latelies?
Got me in a world of shit and now I'm pissed
Mama said there'd be days like this
This the season for ducks and my pen's bleeding
Leaving kids barely breathing for sneak-thieving
Famished from lack of eating and lack of teaching
Banished from 
Rhyme & Reason
 for high treason
Can it be, that the kid with the knock knees
Got G to make a grown man cop plea, for this track
I got a Lovebug like Starski
Blow back until I drop 
Tical Part 3
Ain't no stopping when you start me, John Jay
Pulling your card, mayday mayday, niggas owe they life to God
And now it's payday, take it how ya wanna take it
Fully clothed or butt-naked, I learned the hard way
Ain't nothing sacred in this world, time to face it

I live my life like a lotto ticket, hopin' it win
Purple haze got me chokin' again, open again
I'm what's crackin', like your mamma smokin' again

If you see a model, then you might see me follow
Rubbin' her thighs like Aladdin rub the Genie bottle
Back for another swallow, Method, you know my motto:
""Ya'll might just win today, but I'll be back tomorrow""

Ya'll tryin' to get me started
Who on the short yellow bus tryin' to get retarded?
Kid don't be the artist, formerly known as artist
Jump off a skyscraper, the roof who hit the hardest
Where the bastards at and where they habitats?
I send they asses back to foldin' sweaters at the Gap
I like Nikes, food spicy, I'm a Pisces
That's why women love me and any nigga that's like me
Thoroughbread, I'm with gettin' this dough instead
Need a ho, like I need another hole in the head
Lord help me, I'm crackin' the safe, pocket like 'Face
Mighty Healthy, you know I'm the shit, soon as you smelt me


For what it's worth, the early bird sit at the table and eat first
My niggas need work, mami buggin', rippin' my t-shirt
We can kick it until our feet hurt
Mothers warn your daughters 'bout this tall drink of water
Spoiler, waiter give her anything she order on the menu
Method Man, live at your venue
Smokin' it, jumpin' off the dick, like he mental
Kid, I got a murder rap, and my head is simple

Don't perpetrate pass the blunt let it circulate
Street politicians on a suicide mission
Crime vision finger itching from a scope-view position

Kill a schizophrenic nigga twice cuz-o
That's what happened when frontin on the Shaol' borough
Island of Staten we in here no fear
Assault wit intent

Startin wit yo president,

Yo, yo, yo

Guess who's coming to dinner, put up or shut up
Sit on your ego, when I'm fed up, should of never ended
The missintentions of a Meth Man
I'm sorta like a CEO from Def Jam, minus the 'yes men'
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
I spit things, pop out my neck like shark gill
Live evil, DJ Lethal if you will
My kin's in the kitchen, I got for the kill
I'm like that, beyond ""thunderdome"", Mad Max
Like I'm pissed off, busting on a urinery track
Infection, it burns, anyone that step in my direction
Time to count your money, and your blessings

They like it, when he talk dirty like that
They like it, when he talk dirty like that
Opposites attract, time to face facts
When you bite me, I bite back
Now everybody wanna talk about, hip hop, hop music
Talk about, hip hop, hop music
Talk about, hip hop, hop music
Hop, hop, hop, hop, hop, hop music

It's that state of the art, shit, business man
Formerly known as the artist
If ya'll ain't with me, then forget me
Cuz if I go broke, nothing gon' fix me
Except crispy, hundred dollar bills and fifties
Here's the main course, indeed, bringing it often
The starving for attention M.C.'s, stomachs is talking
About these New York'ns, witty
Who that got appettite for hot scorching plates
Make Little Annie Orphan
Sorta like Kurt Cobain, blowin' his brains
With these lyrics, and funk that 'smells like teen spirit'
Lookin' high, but hold up, look in they eye
And you see crook, coming from that Crooked Letter I


Now gag yourself wit the spoon

Jo Lethal, I'd rather play the odds, fuck equals
Besides, that's the sugar soften tooth to the people
All my people, up til now, you heard it all
And ya'll trying to shit on my lawn, curb your dog
Know just where to find him, at four twenty, son
But the Meth ain't gon' hit ya til 4:21
Now that's game, can't call it, can't complain
Just do the damn thing, like Nike shoe campaign

They Say,Hip-Hop Docktrine: The Official Boondocks Mixtape,UnKnown,"Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was clan in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real

They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say

Like I'm givin you your last rites, when you see my face
All you're lookin at is stars and stripes
With three-fourths of the drug law
So now you know why we build with bricks, they build with straw
Against the mark of the beast
Cause sometimes men must fight wars to truly have peace
Hear to conquer valleys of foreign soil
'til you show me all your hidden weapons and fields of oil
I'm sendin in troops, heavy press want the inside scoop
I'm like mums the word up in this coop - oversee that God
When they move that quick
Admire my swag to use it as a measuring stick
I paid my dues, why we can't lose, plus I refuse
To let 'em stagnate the growth of my blues
The pattern of me is sign no statements, cop no plea
In what can only be American Me


Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

Till you blasted, till y'all come ashes to ashes

Give me, some weed and a light to get my mind right

To find out it'll cost you bout a buck fifty
Across your face swiftly, my after taste shitty
Whose built by New Yitty, whose milked like two titties
And I ain't even got to say my name
I got this duck wit her legs up like, ""say my name, trick""
You think it's all a game, like pussy all the same
I'm speakin' toilet slang, not seakin' hall of fame
It's raw, sushi, stain in your drawers, dooky
Quarter a Lucy, quarter more for a groupie
That like to pop snoopy, think she gon' pop coochie
Just cuz you got Gucci, don't mean you not hoochie
Girl, I tell it like a T-I-N
Ain't no other kids eatin' till I feed my kids
Trick, oh, you ain't crushin', sister, I can't do nothin' wit you
My money's celebate, honey, and we ain't fuckin' wit you
I do it for the nookie, some say I'm too pushy
Only thing better than pussy, that's some new pussy

Boom boom
Meth Lab, second season
This how you make a song nigga
Ayy, ayy

Key to my city, my G is tricky, my tree is sticky
Stairway is pissy, the crown they give me don't even fit me (Huh)
King me, it's risky, if jiggy get me, I plead the fiffy
They'll never snitch me, judge'll convict me, so just acquit me
The fuzz against me, I'm butter-slippery, they think I'm shifty
Zero to sixty, it's just a quickie, you blink, you miss me
I'm just a fishy, got my bread and my chedda crispy
My queen prissy, I kill her dead if she ever quit me
These hoes only look good when tipsy, they said I'm picky, that's perfect
You done scratched the surface, go 'head and sniff me
I'm pushin' fifty, can't find your woman? She pushin' wit' me
Was pushin' lifty, the family business was pushin' piffy
That pusher in me, I did it gritty, no pretty in me
I'm pretty trendy, I had to spend me a pretty penny
One outta many, last to fend me, too many envy
Don't gimmie-gimmie
I do it dirty, no shimmy-shimmy

It's Hanz-arello but you can 'em Shameek from Belly
Method giselle, we comin' out, we gon' catch a felly
About the jelly, the P-L-O what we call the deli
The Lab we smelly, could smell it all in your Pelle Pelle (Woo)
Barq or Cola like refrigerators but ain't no Perry
Careful fuckin' with regulators across the ferry
It's necessary, I gotta bury my adversary
These niggas scary, we commandeering this commissary
This shit is manly, a little somethin', so don't get weary
Wild cats from Missouri, I be your judge and jury
I love a girly who get it poppin', you'll feel the fury
We tellin' Siri to call the pigs to come get near me (C'mon)
Hit a killer to be a killer but ain't no skelly
Pissin' on 'em, we shittin' on 'em, but no R. Kelly
Speakin' country to country, grammar, but ain't no Nelly
Once upon a- from Shaolin wit' no Shkreli

Yow, We them wild cats
You don't want that dope, we keep slangin' 'til it's right on your Coach, come on
Where the Bricks & Staten Isle at?
I got 'em right in my scope, leave 'em dead 'til I turn 'em ghosts, you know?

Come on

Yo, when I ain't sober, I'm bi-polar, invite me over
Doc be dumpin' his ashes in your baby stroller
When I was young I ate paint, lead, with quarter waters
Now Red red linin' the Range Rover motor
I smoke west of the border, your bud outta order
I go apeshit, I'm a Caesar with a little Koba
Tell your boss I'm the opposite of a Trump voter
Yo dude, this wild cat not from Villanova
I'm in the cut, like a buck fifty, I Tony Toka
Your side piece, I'ma poke her and then I adios her
My hood house on the block, we real estate brokers
We make it sound like Forth of July in October
The Bricks, Tommy Motolla, yeah, I'm a high-roller
I write the crack that'll bring back Lamar Odom
That girl got good brains, I know she got diplomas
She fuckin' with a Goodfella, Ray Liotta

I'm kind of a big deal, I'm from the killin' hill
You shackin' a fool, barbeque chicken on the grill
I'm not your run of the mill, so play your peep skills
I hope your girl's on the pill 'cause she's a cheap thrill
We shoot to kill, blood spill for that dollar bill
Your body parts'll be landfilled in Potter's Field
You ain't really real, you bust when pressure build
Like steel water in pipes when the winter chill
My Louieville slugger, I call it Lucille
See Lucy Lou, you like Kill Bill, the kid's ill
The doc fillet 'em like veal, you see his last meal
Your brains spill on your duck bill when caps peeled
Might rupture my Achille heel chasin' this hunnid mills
Streetlife, I'm hard to kill, call me the man of steel
Real recognize real, I got mass appeal

 Deadly melody part two
 That's my word!
It ain't safe no more... bitch!

Yo, yo
Brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Movin with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
Red the head in, dapple light centered
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine
Anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
Observe the magnetic attraction

And it's time for some grid...

...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel
Throw you off the Verrazano
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I rate bodyguard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark
P.L.O., bust like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, Tecs in afros, we back yo
It's Dolemite, crash your windpipe, with the mic device
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot out the street lights

Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, mergin with my A-Alikes
Splurgin, dirty to the grain, no detergent
Filthy, innocent until I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, it's curtains

It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lot of sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is complete, it captures bass

Yo, I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlar, 9 Glocks
Technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckled a foe, intro to outro
Calico, throw verse, but slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go bezerk
From the Shao' borough, whylin out on the furlow
Commando, styles thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermonuclear degrees
Heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the Garden, them fans stampede
For the top cats, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, head or gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust

We be the world's most fabulous
Hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagant, je-wel drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphize, I got stocks to buy
Watch my pockets rise, to the bottom bust confide in God
In Sin I trust, the villianous, criminal minded killers rust
I intend to build and fortify in men
Mastermind rhymin, navigate the globe then retire quick

Aiyyo fluid rap bend through it black, buluga black Ac'
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical
Mathematical, slide up in your work casual
Nike Air Dog, who wear it all, plus down to brawl
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network bezerk, mad hurtin
Killer whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomingdales
Masqevendo, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through your Benz window

*gunshots followed by a car alarm*

A-yo, a-yo
The I-N-T-E-double-L

It’s like I’m trapped inside a cage
I can’t explain this type of rage
It’s not a moment or a phase
But possibly the end of days
Watch as I stand up on the stage
Not as an artist but a slave
Deep inside my subconscious
My music keeping me sane
They say it’s levels to the shit, I say it’s levels to your brain
You can’t acquire the higher, you’ll always remain the same
Regardless of all the money and bitches yanking your chain
What good is a private plane to a man who can’t walk the plains
Hip-hop is now gen-pop, populated with lames
Attacking you with these frequencies meant to destroy your brain
I’m fitting to go supernova expose em to super-flames
Soon as I pick these locks on these psychological chains
The answer is in the question the question comes from the pain
And the pain is just electrical signals sent to my brain
But the brain is just a box where information remains
As I try to remain a soldier, the voice in my head explains

I’m still shadowboxing lungs and oxygen
This an icebreaker, no bubblegum was popping
Another hot concoction trick, ya might need amoxicillin
The kid’s too sick, you're gonna need shots to kill em
My method is ill, Doc admit him
When I see you, ICU can get em
Your boy give em bars until the judge acquit him
The court can’t convict him or find the gloves to fit him
That’s OJ, I mean OK, I mean, I’m not kidding, no play
Jealous ones still envy, that’s Jose
Peace to Cartagena, I flow hey
But I don’t speak Spanish, yo no se
I’m a seasoned veteran, obey
Obtain a freestyle, it’s cold pay
The old me, resort to my old ways
My old man was stuck in his old days
Still he wanna blaze like John but rapping ain’t in his forte

Look how we did it to ya
Y’all just don’t get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
I'mma get it to ya (x4)
What rapper spit it truer?
But they don’t live it, do ya?
My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya(RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)

It was only the elite who could walk these streets
With jewels and not get stuck, niggas didn’t give a fuck
Real G’s know I’m talking about
Taking what you making, stripping what you wearing
Caring about nothing
Gun barrel in your face, cold steel on your cheek
This is how we meet and greet, enemy across the street
Leaning on his Rover jeeps, smiling, showing all our teeth
Seeking son in my hood, it ain’t all sweet
And you haven’t earned the respect
Of those who come, creep and take money
So you just food that niggas come eat
And they don’t get no chain back
You might see em rocking that
Fuck you looking at? Problem needs solving
You see that big 357 thing revolving…revolving

Yeah, you niggas ain’t street, my money talks word of mouth
I figured you out the life I live, you’re not about
Price on your head, I’m taking cash advances
I’ll take my chances, then deal with the circumstances
Livin’ off the land like a land shark
I’m on the lamb like the gyro with the white sauce
Idle times a devil playground, make moves
Watch me kill your whole vibes, crush groove
Hands high, say hello to my little friend
Point the finger at the bad guy, it’s me again
Who are they to criticize me? I do it like a G
I’m a nigga from the motherfucking streets
Throw me in the fire, watch me bubble
I was built for the struggle, my knees never buckle

Look how we did it to ya
Y’all just don’t get it do you?
Special deliver to ya
This is how we give it to you
I'mma get it to ya (x4)
What rapper spit it truer?
But they don’t live it, do ya?
My shooter cock the Ruger
This is how we get it to you
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)
I'mma get it to ya (RAW)

The Oath,"Catch the Throne: The Mixtape, Vol. 2 ",2015.0,"Night gathers, and now my watch begins
It shall not end until my death
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory
I shall live and die at my post
I am the sword in the darkness
I am the watcher on the walls
I am the shield that guards the realms of men
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch
For this night and all the nights to come

Night gathers, my watch begins
To manifest 'til death, and it shall not end
I take no wife, no land, father no children
I wear no crown, win no glory and I shall not bend
I am the shield  that's here to guard the realms of men
I been in hell, while they're asking where the hell I've been
I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher of all
That means I'm heartless, bigger they come harder they fall
I pledge my life and my honor to the Night's watch
For this night and nights to come I give my life, watch
See the black crow, watch it revolve
Some call us black brothers
Ice watch, colder than yours, we wear them black colors

Are you even man enough to take the oath
Man enough to take a dagger to a throat
Or are you only man enough when it matters the most?
Whats the matter?
You was thinking your life mattered? It don't

Do you know what leadership means?
It means that the person in charge gets second guessed by every little twat with a mouth
But if he starts second guessing himself, that's the end

I am the sword in the darkness, the watcher of all
That means I'm heartless, bigger they come harder they fall
(Night Watch)(x2)

'Cause the day I lost my brother, I was sittin' with my mother and she told me I would never be alone (Yeah)
So I grabbed that four-five, why should homie be alive when he got my best friend? Now he gone
No, this shit just so wrong (Yeah)
Remember his cousin was callin' my phone (Brrrp)
Like, Blanco, let's get him, I know where he headed
He need to be deaded, let's go
So we hit the road, gone off them shrooms like I'm Toad (Whoop)
Hoppin' to Fourth, that four-forty-four close
It's on, soon as you see 'em, let go
Reloaded it and dump it some more (B-r-r-r-p)
So we posted up by the store
Freezin', it's twenty below
Blowin' this weed by the O
We just 'bout to leave and then, yo, I think I just seen me that fiend that hit Gene and my bro
He's right on the corner with Steven and Joe
Now it's open season, I'm fiendin' to blow
So Lee hop up outta the whip, when he let that shit rip, I saw all of 'em three on the floor, whoa
But I guess what can I say?
I hit JFK and was back to LA (Whoo)
A thief in the night and a thief in the day
So I take what I want, while I'm chiefin' the J

These rappers is trash
I give these rappers the drag then ask, ""Is you mad or you mad?"" (Rah)
Haters, I'm flickin' 'em all
Critics have written 'em off

I might not be bigger than Ross but still might be bigger than yours
I smell like the vault

I mean it, I seen it before
Their momma a queen like Afeni Shakur
Meth know the meanin' of floor
They fiend to be king of New York
But why if the kingdom is poor?
Now we keepin' score
Don't know what you figure me for
Who told you the city was yours? (Aah)
Round of applause and you get around just because (Ha)
You wasn't down for the cause
Provin' the form, hope it ain't you in the morgue
See, this what I do when I'm bored
Nothin' to do with the law
Got nothin' to do wit'cha boy
The cops'll put two in your boy
Your day'll be worn for sure

Hah
Whoa
Yeah
Meth Lab 2
Let's go
Hah
Look

I'm underrated, no attention from under payment
I undertake 'em where underground is an understatement
These underages ain't understandin' I'm undegraded
Under my status, you'll see my picture, right, I'm the greatest
I'm compenstated, one composition, it's complicated
My competition, number two, but it's constipated
This unconditional, unconventional condemnation
It's to convince you to find your way out the conversation
I'm so amazin', break fast when most waitin'
The beef bakin', eggs is runny, my toast raisin'
Suppose I blaze 'em
A lot of haters and most hate 'em
Ain't gotta name 'em or name the city that don't claim 'em
And I don't blame 'em, ultimately there's ultimatum
It's all verbatim, these rappers finished before I say 'em
Before the mayhem, there was Method, see mother made 'em
But mother F 'em in every method his mother gave 'em
So many rappers to kill, where did the time go?
Might even be a friend of the family but you ain't mine, though
Choppa to the side of ya top, it'll let your mind go
Don't test that Big Poppa that you ain't Ready To Die for
Die hoe, it's Snow White sniffin', I kill you, heigh ho
Unless you're one of Destiny's Children, you won't survive, hoe
So many rappers to kill, where did the time go?
Might even be a friend of the family but you ain't-
Yo, look, who sippin' bones made from tiger?
Robbin' that vagina like the dream was made in China
Hard timer, son could be the shooter and the driver
Off the rack, find her like you see no Future in Desiigner
No disprect to either, I'ma rhymer
Give Aretha to Obama
Got a problem? give 'em Ether
I'm tryna smash once, you could keep her
I gave that trick the thumb, ""bye Felicia""

Woke up in the morning, like ten A.M
Walked passed the Listerine, went straight for the gin
Osama Bin Laden on my chinny chin chin

Yo, Meth, the mailman!

Yo, Ghost, let him in!

Will you sign, Mr. Ghostface, package for a friend, here
Right by the X, my bad, here's a pen

Gucci flip flops, I box my way to the kitchen
My keys is missin', my trees is missin'
No more parties, cuz Doc need to listen

Cuz something in my closet, go look (he's a pissin')
I cursed this bitch out, we be laid back

Half a box of cereal gone, my milk's warm
Thta's wrong, this is John John, pro and con phenomenon
Stretch with a morning yawn, party 'til the break of dawn
Ladies throw your faces on, sing it when the break come on

Ichi, ni, san, shi
Boats (suites) dough (beats)
No cat give you these, rap flow triple g's
Meth, Ghost, Killa Beez, you know we ride

Wu-Tang, the best rap group of all time
Rush little shotgun, rest around nine
Refrigerator, fish and sweets with no swine
Dirty and Meth guest room with four dimes
And U-G. had a Masta headache
Him and Genius flew back from, Uganda black, gettin' that cake
Where Divine at? Wine at
Tell a DJ to rewind that, Killa killed it wit a blind back
Dime sack, you know we blew that wit the cognac
Them bowling ball lead head niggas, we call them pawn yacks

I say my girl, like to party all the time, Ghost
Spend up my ends, every week, she always cryin' broke
Thank God it's friday, I just got paid
Feelin' good like I just got laid
The next drink's on me, instead of, oh God, you think O.G
White girls they comin' out, like they Pink on E
So you better get the party started, we get it crunk regardless
We got the 'dro and hypnotic, them kids is puffin' garbage
Is where it's crackin' at, Street is you passin' that?
Mami's is grabbin' ass, Johnny, I'm grabbin' back
You know my habitat, you know my peoples
If you wit me, where you at
There ain't nothin' compared to that, come on!

Ichi, ni, san, shi

No flows ill as these, M and Ghost, nigga please

I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cup, but they ain't chipped in
(These cheap muthafuckas be grown ass men
Tight muthafuckas finish your shit then they bounce off with them)
Come back again, drunk off your gin
And when they try to get you for they ends, that's no friend
That's no friend, eh, eh

Yeah, ah, yeah, yo, yo, yeah
Yeah, motivate, motivate, from the gate, ya'll
Yeah, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo

Yo, we the Gods, still tear the whole hood apart
Darts that'll splatter through faces, taste niggas hearts
I'm intellectual, plus professional
And Walbaums to vegetables
Shit is right here, like buyin' fly gear
Dare any white man or fan nigga, ran through niggas
Blew shotties in niggas lobbies, the grand RZA
We left, the radio broke, I yoke my vocals, hittin' green smoke
Allah Math', show me when the needle broke
Numb the whole crowd up, stupid ass Loud fouled up
Never knew what they had, now they proud of us
Picture my vision, precision, lines jumpin' out of commission
Divine got me, nigga, the boss, he pop me
Rae, we gotta generate, lord, I feel the Ditech, the mildew
Buy jets and vehicles, steal a little
Wrap up the whole rap government

Go 'head, ya'll floss wit' it
Walk wit', I slap your boss wit' it
Navy blue, New York fitted, I'm cold frost bitted
Two puffs and off wit' it
You'll smell the herb 'fore I lit it, the spots is forfeited
Blocks is hot, feel the shot from the fo'-fitty
With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar
It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that
Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter?
The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'?
Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin'
Your street team, bunch of weaklings
Don't ever let me catch your reaching
Respect when a grown man is speaking
Shh, keep on sleeping, and just like TLC, I keep on Creeping
To five percent of ya'll, keep on teachin'
The heat seeking missile official, that got issue
Like Funk Doc got snot tissue, it's Hott Nikkels

""Everywhere I turn, I see, your face, but you're never there""

Shh... shit ain't over..
Okay, now, same shit, different day, grinding, gettin' paid
Self at it, automatic, guns that spit and spray
Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight
Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play
Ya'll gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka
House full of bloodsuckas and hoes that love hustlers
Roll that izza, pour me another kizza
Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up
Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes
Let the herb spots run til' the cops come
Suppose I was just another stick in the mud
On a Saturday thinkin', how I'ma get the fifth in the club
See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it
We comes undisputed, with batteries included
Honey's ""bee"" like Meth, I be like what?
They want some free CDs, I'm like ""see these"" nuts

One time.. yo

Never liked son from day one, bring you tool
That nigga stick you and play dumb, hate a bitch-ass
Who care where you came from, you ain't prepared
For when the pain come, this nigga scared, shook to death
From a cold stare, stuntin, knowin my brothers fiend
To do you somethin over here, we head huntin
In the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin
I Smash Pumpkins, Hard Rock be in the Cafe
Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us
The last days, makin sure I get the last say
In the food chain, is you predator or prey?
If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back
Crack your vertabrae, lookin for a better way
To get my point across, thoughts accelerate
At the same speed, of the muder rate
Lord, never perpetrate a fraud, til my nigga Carlton Fisk
See the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth

Life's a snippet, one way ticket
Time tickin fast, blink you might miss it
Semen on Street shit, you might catch fifty stitches
Body bag sprayed up, buried in muddy ditches
I play for keeps, bust heat you catch cold feet
My rap sheet, speak for itself, concrete
Evident, Killa Hill, resident, double dart agent
Secret intelligent my rap style's flagrant

Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street Life, Deck and Mobb Deep, Play IV Keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin when you gotta eat, we hold it down

I move like Mad Max 'cross the wasteland
One hand holds the head of the last brave man
Made man, Cuban Link chain of command
Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand
My live team turn the club to a crime scene
High beams flash, promoters die behind CREAM
Get your face blown, might face the chrome
We take this more serious than just a poem

I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent
About the foul shit goin on in my life, current event
It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville
Thinkin to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill?
Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase
Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's
So I chill, put my killa niggas on the battlefield
On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still
Never follow beef hey beef follow me
Wanna settle in the court I say settle in the streets
Like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it
Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it
I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute
Stash my dough secure the funds of profit

Yo, extreme rhyme niggas, you wastin your time
Fuckin with my niggas, extrordinary line swishin
Your mind out position, tryin to figure this shit
Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this
Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song
Doin this for too long, to not come strong
You're only a pawn of Viet Dong
Tryin to form against mines, you musta just been born
Secluded on a distant farm
This is the real world, where niggas get shot and shanked
Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed
Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch
It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck..

Black suit, 7:30, couple shooters from the trap
They done killed the homie brother

Who gon' tell his baby mother that her dude ain’t coming back?
That kind of pain is hard to put into a rap
The block is hot and can’t nobody move a pack
When you shooting on-site, you aim the Ruger at his naps
Cut his tongue, hog-tie him, things we usually do to rats
What? Who gassed you up and threw a match?
Don’t want police to line you up and you a match
Fool them clowns into thinking you a snack
Brought a gun to wash it down and you can drink it through the tap

Now try to picture Malcolm X without the strap
If Meth Man could navigate the globe without a map
I could beat the pussy up without a scratch

I’m so ignorant, spend it before I make it
Pour salt on my food before I taste it
Pour salt in your wounds, right in the basement
All of us, statement, one vision, rich dreams
Couple scars, I heal quicker than Wolverine
Population, pink slips, quarter greens
Hood millionaires hide when the wolves out
Move with security, hold tight to your jewelry
Uh – that’s my reaction, now react
Once your hood pass revoked, you never get it back
Benzes, Bentleys, nah nigga don’t tempt me
Trust I got it on me, I’ma squeeze till it’s empty
Lord forgive me, I need that new 550
With the cocaine seats, I’m so street
And when the police came, we don’t speak
From my hood to your hood, ain’t nothing sweet

Meant it when I said it, lungs bring the pain son
Without the anesthetic, make em look pathetic
Needing help from paramedic, Hot with the Nickel
Bust back take em with you, survival of the fittest
And the world out to get us, I feel it in my bones
I can feel it in my testosterone when it's on
Stat' bring it back, hard rap for your pussycat
Cognac, off the meat rack, where the pussy at?
Johnny, got these niggas mad at they mommy
Jumping on my hard salami, say what you like
In the heat of the night, I crash individuals
Splash on the mic airtight with the lyrical

Nigga run with it, have fun with it
Blow your gun with it, and be done with it
Welcome to the killing field where Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie niggas going through changes

It all starts with the pad and pen, my special blend
Of herbs and spices on mic devices, murder men
Make em mices I recommend, something that's priceless
For you rap hooligans, claiming you nicest
Call it what you like kid.. you can even call
A psychic for all I care, still ain't got a prayer
Amongst the righteous, Blazini, cheat death like Houdini
Word to Bad Bird that fucked nerds in bikinis
Observer, lyrical flares, you being served
From the gizzard, plucking yo' nerves with nouns and verbs
From the ghetto to the suburbs, I must be heard

The heat's on, you think one-eight, and Johnny's blamed
Who that nigga burn biscuits, and spit flame
Leave no witness, in the fast lane with shady bitches
That only want me for my riches, I know your steez

For hearing impaired, to get a share, now what's happening
Money to share, that's why we here
And y'all actin, like we can't eat, like y'all eat

Suspect Chin Music,Tical 2000: Judgement Day,1998.0,"Suspect chin niggas, no win niggas
Send niggas back to go, try again niggas
All hail me, the good the bag the ugily
The money's around your way, lovely
Where for art thou Meth-tical god-child
I pack a smile like crocodile profile
Can't hold it down? oh the shit gon' hit the fan now
Spin around let your whole crown man down, man down

I live by the street code never old
Never love a ho, never flash the dough
Cause you never know who friend or foe
Got block control solid gold thought
Before the blow lets stroll through the ghetto
Habitat with no parole
Never snitch switch which
Keep a fresh pair of kicks
Split the tongue snatch the weed
In case the cops wanna strip search
Think first prepare for the worst
When you do dirt
Remember there's a million other niggas with the same thirst

No doubt dummy out
Bets pull the money out
Niggas walk a funny route
This is what its all about?
Young guns and dum-dums
Slum bums and sons
Askin' niggas where they come from
Get him for his ones, um
Sunshine, its crunch time
Stranded on the front line
Ducking from the one-time
Niggas on the run, where the cameras can't come, ha
Make this one the anthem
Ring around the rosie
Pocket full of Grants, uh

Just because you wild in the club you ain't thug
Sport gloves and gold mugs you ain't thug
Tattoos and hard screws don't make you thug
Sucker for love catch a slug, nigga

Suspect chin niggas, no win niggas
Send niggas back to go, try again niggas
Shotgun slammin' in your chest piece, blaow
Shotgun slammin' in your chest piece, blaow

Carry a ox and avoid spots
Cell blocks rap blow you for your slot time
What you got's mines
We can take it to the yellow lines and we can pull nine
Whether the rhyme or the crime I'm a still shine
Heavy on the street talk, cut your life support short
Never had no love for you so it ain't no love lost
Strictly enforced by a street source, get double-crossed
Hands off, I run with the torch

They got me fed up from the head up
Put up or shut up
On stage in them shiny get-ups?
Niggas is funny
Energizer bunny actors
They hustle backwards
Son, I think they gay rappers, say word
Drops will slash ya, darts splash ya
Party crasher, the spell caster
Heard the same before and after
It's over
Slug hit your brain, end of game
Dun, its over
End of the line, out of time, bitch its over
On the wrong street with no heat, hmm, it's over
We soldiers somebody should've told ya

Suspect chin niggas, no win niggas
Send niggas back to go, try again niggas
Shotgun slammin' in your chest piece, blaow
Shotgun slammin' in your chest piece, blaow
Suspect chin niggas, no win niggas
Send niggas back to go, try again niggas
Shotgun slammin' in your chest piece, blaow
Shotgun slammin' in your chest piece, blaow

With the W burning through your flesh
Verbally possessed, never second-guess
Blow minds like David Koresh
Fuck a vest, you need a gun to protect your assets
Deep in the Aztecs, break out before the sun set
Street wars, gimme yours, crime is what I live for
Got rhymes galore, next time it's at the Wu store
If you sleep late, next date is at the cest gate
All you sober mc's, I leave y'all niggas half-baked

Microphone is in a choke hold
Losin' control, bringing drama by the boatload
It takes drama
In the pillage now of Cappadonna
My split persona hit their village and their baby mama
Y'all niggas playing with this money while we stay hungry
And kept it pudgy it won't make me have to crash, dummy
Before its over
You should keep your chain tucked in
And should never run your mouth with a suspect chin
Now lay it down",https://genius.com/Method-man-suspect-chin-music-lyrics
World Gone Sour,UnKnown,2011.0,"These kids are sour until the day that they're chewed down
That's bad news now they now they bringin' bad news down
First they're sour then they're sweet little dudes
And they gonna fight the power till they food
Now eat em up, Shut up and eat em up
This beat goes hard I just gotta eat it up
Its like I'm runnin , I gotta eat it up
And when they candy goes raw just gotta eat it up

Coming back out of the cracks of sofas and fanny packs
This ain't a candy rap this is where the candy attacks
See, when they lost that's when their sanity snaps
They break laws, not jaw-breakers, but break jaws
In fact, real heavy like a monkey on your back
Got some thumb-tacks playing pin the donkey with your cat
But fuck that plant a fire cracker where you dump at
Right besides the shower where you keep the penis pump at
Oh no, they creepin' like some ninjas in their dojo
They knock the little man off the horsey on your polo
Crushin' all your dreams, cut the string from your yo-yo
Trade your Lamborghini for a Volvo
I bet you thought that this was a promo
But no-no, this is Boba Fett meets Han Solo
Kids gone loco, until you sink your teeth in
You know the motto, if life's a treat then you're eatin'


Oh snap, look what fell out the patch
Right in this fool's lap, how uncool is that
All right jack, now you're on the wrong side of the map
With a busted GPS and on the wrong side of the snacks
They fight back, in fact they're rolling like the army
Throw bleach in laundry, unfold your origami
I like that some snacks sweeter in the end
But then again, ain't nothin' sweeter then revenge
Now they are on your Facebook deleting all your friends
Clogging up your toilet with a poop eating grin
All up in your closet cutting holes in every pocket
That you like to keep your wallet and I promise I'm a pimp
Wipe the music off your MP3
Burn a rug, pull the plug on your MTV
This is thug vision in 3D
These kids aren't worth it they play dirty like they are ODB",https://genius.com/Method-man-world-gone-sour-lyrics

Get it how I’m living, got an ounce of Steve Rifkind, that’s that green loud
Yes sir, no child left behind, pump your brakes (scrrrrrrrr)

Problem,4:21... The Day After,2006.0,"You don't want no problems, problems
You don't want no problems, problems
Yeah... real man... with ya stinkin' ass
Come on... that's my nigga right there... let's do it
Never count me out, nigga, just count me in... yeah...

Look, I ain't came to bone these chicks
Not this time, I got a bone to pick, I got a zone of piff
Now, who that nigga in the zone and shit
Back in the building like he own the bitch, nobody cold as this
If I ain't got it, then it don't exist
I spit that bird flu, my flows is sick, I'm still as ill as they come
Protect Ya Neck, when you dealing with them
Now Erick stick a fork in him, he done, hah
It boggles the mind, like try'nna 'ketchup' to a bottle of Heinz
It's like forensics try'nna follow the crime, they want time
And sometime, a nigga had to swallow them dimes
While 85 percent swallowing swine, see
Wherever he roam, it's all gravy, man, whenever he home
Long as I got myself I'm never alone, feel even better with chrome
If there's a problem, nigga, let it be known
And while I sleep, my bitch be checkin' my phone, cause I'm a problem, nigga

Ease up, or put them g's up
Scream at ya frog, nigga leap up (now who got a problem with that?)
They need to beast up, nigga, speak up or
Forever hold they peace up (if they got a problem with that)
Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) Hey you (don't want no problem nigga)
Hey you (don't want no problem nigga) Hey you (don't want no problem nigga)
Hey you (""Believe, what I say, when I tell ya"" - DMX sample)
Yeah, you, nigga, you don't want no problem with that

Look, my Clan all one in the same
Until my name number one in the game, it's not a game, nigga
Like Billy Danze, I be running with Fame
Me and my lynch mob coming to hang, it's Wu-Tang for life
Hard body, another day in the life
Credit his momma now for raising him right, just want the people to know
I'm bout to blow, like I'm shaking the dice
Making me mad? Nah, y'all making me right, cause y'all was taking me light
So let my pen talk and say what he like
And have the court system say and indict, I'm O.J.ing the mic
Liquid plumber, I be laying the pipe
And if it's tight, girl, I'm staying tonight
Not only raising on the price, on M.C.'ing, but I'm raising the bar
And if you scary, nigga, wait in the car
Motherfuckers I'm hard, hard as cooked up in mayonaise jars
Purple haze, Cuban layed cigars, I'm a problem, nigga


E, you know I'm just like that
Big baller nigga, just like Shaq, so come on, niggas
If they bust, I better bust right back
Meth spit it from the gut, like *gunshot* man down
I'm that dude, hands down, stand down
I'm past due, for Cash Rule, y'all can't clown
I'm bank now, your ass lose, nothing but rhyme

Somebody Done Fucked Up,4:21... The Day After,2006.0,"Yeah... one-two, one-two, it's Big M-E-F
The phenom from Vietnam, fresh out of rehab, yo
On my way the weedspot, haha, what's good?
Fuck that, what's hood? Staten Island Advance
Big up to my man Magic down in MIA, what up cuzo?

Knock-knock, who is it, ah shitted
Hot peas and butter, come and get it
Somebody done fucked up, now
Meth spit it, I comes with it
Quick to tell these critics, eat a did-ick
Somebody done fucked up, now
Y'all done did it, done stepped in it
Now run and tell them niggas who the realest
Somebody done fucked up, now
Can you dig it, you'll never stop the kid up in the fitted
Live with it, somebody done fucked up

Look, I'm cutting corners on these clowns, marijuana and pounds
Found with Staten Island niggas that run up on you with rounds
Take a drag, pass it around, guess who back in your town
And the crowd vict', with Officer Brown patting him down
Shit's thick, thick as harmony grits, cuz with some thugs
Ain't no, harmony bitch, them niggas probably snitch
Y'all be the judge, look what happened to Cocheese
What happens when your co-d's is talking to police, you dig?
Half a cig, let me fuck with ya wig, although you loving the style
They're ain't a pedophile could fuck with the kid
Now that I'm back up on my, feet, take it back to the streets
In the GM with your BM, in the passenger seat
Riding hood, by my hood, ain't no hike in the wood
Life is good, it's so good, live it twice if I could
Man, it's me, once again it's that Wu-Tang
Crushing the shit that you bring, you know how we do things


Yo, pulling my shoes up, scuffing my Timbs, back to when?
Puffing again, who stunting, cops fucking with them
Feeling the blow, goosebumping the skin, and on the scale
Of nothing to ten, a ten, man, it's nothing to him
See you can tell by how I'm clutching my pen, like Mae Weather touching her chin
She stunting, going up in her friend
Tell the label give me something to spin, and every light got a price
You want a slice, but we ain't cutting you in
Man, these fiends know my past work, held a monkey until they back hurt
Money talking, wonder what that's worth
And MCF, mean Cash First shit, picture the kid
On the beach in Hawaii, minus the grass skirt
Blast first, ask questions last
Black herse, nigga, stretch yo ass, y'all niggas know what this is
It's New Yitty, this ain't just a fad
It's M-E-F, and I ain't Biggie, but I'm just as Bad, Boy


Yeah, Big M-E-F, Staten Island Advance, motherfuckers
Word up, don't ever count me out, just count me the fuck in

Shit, we stay poppin' it

Game, stay on top of it
Lame, just the opposite
It's no thang, when I bring the pain ain't no stopping it (hold on)

This just ya boy, I'm some on other shit
My nigga, take a puff of this
Piff man, I'm loving this, is Staten Island up in this?
Bitch, like we running it, and somebody wanna public (I'm coming)
Turn it up a bit, so my thugs can thug a bit
If I got my brother get, K, we got another hit
Ladies please, where y'all puffin' them trees?
I'm damaging M.C.'s, oxygen, you can't breathe, fall

Fall out, yeah, I'm going all out (hold on)
Hold on, man, what's really going on (I'm coming)
And when I'm coming, a hundred miles & running (keep back)
Keep back, y'all ain't got it like that (fall out)

Here we go again, herb-smoke, blowing in the wind
Cops chasing, wanna throw him in the pen
And the day he leave the game, yo, he going in the Benz
On them 24's looking like he rolling on the rims
All daying, knawimsayin', I'm staying up to par, parleyin'
While y'all hating, I'm splitting this cigar
Man, it's nathan, all y'all do is aim and start spraying
Cuz tonight's the night, and me and my niggas ain't playing (keep back)
Y'all done did it now, another critic kicked Tical
Alotta niggas mad cuz I ain't fold like they figure, now
Let me put my fitted down
*hwak*
Spit around
Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now
Here I got that miracle, sickest individual
Flow that's so original, see this is what they meant to do
It's not an act, it's all actual fact
The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall

Aww shit, ain't this about a bitch
I give a fuck about a bitch, I'm more about a grip
And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back)
What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it
Meth is chillin' like milk top killing
If it ain't got no real in it, I'm probably not feeling it (keep back)
I'm deadin' ya kids, and burn another blizz

Out the whole click, she the baddest bitch
Dose-doh, round your partner, switch
Clan in Da Front,
 we be starting shit
No don't trip, dog, spark 'em, quick
Holla when a real nigga talkin', trick
We got grip, but we ain't spendin' shit
You and your friends, stop pretendin' trip

Let a nigga get nut pushed, better yet let a nigga get some head
I work 'em, work 'em or feed 'em, burp 'em, then jerk 'em, instead
I get my nuts pushed, on the bottom to the top of your gums
I feel your slurpin', slurpin, I'm skeetin' and squirtin' your tongue
And I got about 5 grand, but I won't be spendin' a dime
See cuz overspendin's a crime and I can't be spendin' my time
If you get your guts pushed, could be of cuz Luda and Meth
Could be of cuz we do it best, could be of cuz we screw 'em to death

Come up out of them dirty clothes (bend on over and touch them toes)

(Meth & Luda we lock and load) Round your partner, now dose-doh
Uh-oh, we-oh, we-oh! (Come on and ride this rodeo)

And wobble, gobble again, tell a couple of friends
I slap that ass, bitch, take a look and see what you got in
Cuz I've been schemin' and plottin', to have you breathin' and stoppin'

What we talkin' bout? Pussy poppin', car hoppin' women
See 'em watchin', clockin', pigeons
Flockin' Luda they jockin', lightin' buddha, and boots is rockin'
Nameless hoes, take 'em brainless with painted toes
Famous, she code, twerkin' pussy, hurtin', workin' that pose

They wanna raise that pussy tab, price and position
Enticin' these women, given the proper juice
Life that they livin', hope that they double deuce
Shifted ass cheeks, last week and Ludacris is backseat
Afraid so, ask son, taste them

Now watch me, dog 'em, freak 'em
Out every weekend, she puttin' APB's on my dick
I keep on bettin' and breathin', where's my pants, I'm leavin'
I'm speakin' facts, mamies creepin' and they cheatin'
They even sleepin' with mats, some be eatin' that cat
I'm teasin', indecent expose, Method be tweakin'

Yo, I'll start this rhyme with how y'all feel in this bitch
I'm finna to spit, got steel in my grip
But I ain't talkin bout guns, I'm talkin mics, niggas stealin my shit
Then try to act like they ain't feelin my shit
Now if we talkin bout ones, I'm Russell Simmons I be talkin in tongues
Fuck where you from and all the niggas you brung
Punk, My clan don't sleep son, I put that on each one
Be cool until the heat come, these pussies might eat some
Nigga this is not pop music, unless your tryna pop shots to it
Why would you have that Glock and not use it
How could you hear this joint and not lose it
You stupid, You need to shot from cupid to get love for this music
Diamond in the ruff, Like iodine, Find me in the cut
If not, probably find me in a slut, if I buy me a Dutch
That means Mef Man's back with the stuff, Lot of back talkin backin it up

Now I like bein the man, I like weed in my hands
I like my G's in advance, But y'all don't understand
Me no like, fake niggas that ain't got the game right
Me no like, when y'all killas pop shit and can't fight

Back in the zone, No backbone
He stepped on and spat on, niggas don't last long
If I don't get some act-right soon, I'm gonna act wrong
I ain't tryin to get clapped on for makin these rap songs
If you're misunderstood pimp, what would the hood think?
To know that I've been swindled, bamboozled, and hoodwinked
These rappers ain't like me, they see that there might be
More to me then some Air Force Ones and a white tee, I'm nice B
6 foot 4, Un-cut raw, pocket full of straws, I'm that nigga to look for
Want paper like a book store, ain't never been shook poor
I switch from Method Man to Candy Man and the hooked off
Still ain't nothin sweet though, Who wanna spit flows
First learn to put the weed inside the bag and then get dough, (Then get dough motherfucker)
Tell your peoples and kin folk, I been dope, Anything else is an insult. (God damn right)


So obnoxious that I'm toxic, Call that diarrhea
Spit that hot shit, cause I'm hot bitch, And got butter-fingers
Oops I drops it, load and locks it, Take the recipe that’s been concocted
Got women just like a vehicle, Topless
First You see what I'm worth, Pullin paper straight out the wood work
Until I push dirt, Shit I hate to fuck up a good shirt
But damnit I'm back, I done relapsed, Shot a dose of some murder I wrote, Then lean back
I'm part Ghost, Part Cappa, RZA, And Deck
Part Dirty, Uey, GZA, Masta Killa, And Chef
But I'm all Mef, All vet, Killers I'm complex
Niggas, Have yet to blow up, Nothin but bomb threats
New York yall, Shoot or shank me, I bleed Yankee
I'm hot dog, Yall ain't nathan to put it frankly
I find excuses to finally lose it, Then write exclusive

Hittin' like Mack trucks, head splittin' paper written
In windy cities like Chicago, no bullshh shh
You see me spittin' at the kitten with the lost mitten
As we engage in cold war gettin' frostbitten
Once again up in these stank drawers baby listen
One mind and for one cause, heavy hittin'
The penalty illegal ruffnecks, we bring ruckus
In pursuit of gold lines, can a nigga touch it
If I can't see ya can't truss it
A shady character like Buzz Buzzard
Lay him out like a plush rugged
Now you can love it, or leave it alone
We drink death and puff bone
Draggin' your body out the end zone
And any way the wind blow that's where you flow
That's why you be the first one caught, last to know
Body layin' out on the flo', substitute
Heavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'
Third and long, quarterback pack the cannon on
I go deep he drop bombs, that's when I touch down
Six points, what now?
Once again who comin' through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous?
Ever since I came with this, and wrecked a body
You convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous
Offensive shotgun
Calm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun
Deep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game

You win some you lose some that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some it's in the game
You win some you lose some, that's how it goes son

A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
Shit locked down, like my niggas out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin' cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your ear piece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
And thrill, lyrics spittin', through my lips
Doing backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Waters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
The rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin' double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be? It be I, the nigga with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb, guard your grill

And call my black women outta their name
I'm serious, they're out of my brain
Understand that my slang's
Fast and furious, they're out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me blaze
In the industry I'm not, they be calling me slave
I ain't trynna burn the spot, but I'm set in my ways
I'm just a product of the block, and the city I'm raised, Aha
I'm still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the strode
Daddy pimping 'em for doe
Early in the morning cops kicking in the do'
Man I think somebody snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he try to tell me things are different than befo'
Kids don't listen any mo', that's for sho'
We used to ask permission from our folks
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
And I ain't trynna miss another meal
Cause love will get you killed
And if it don't, your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that it's real
Until that undercover pull a shield
And now it's kinda late to cut a deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
Why I'm trynna keep my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should'a went to school and got a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I steal
That's why I got this Ruger in your grill",https://genius.com/Method-man-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics
50 Shots,The Meth Lab,2015.0,"Meth Man Cory Gunz go bang
Streetlife gotta knife, homie run your chain
Mack, riding around the city and we do our thing
From a city that is known to do crazy things
You already I’m heavy y’all stay in your lane
We ready Stat fete still playing the game
Mack, ladies in the show singing every hook
But they’re gonna get their panties took, so lets go

Aye aye, y’all don’t get the picture before we focus
Facts, look who back, crooked like scoliosis, the take over
Take this line straight up your noses
This for my smokers but this time I up the dosage
This my closest, to perfection 
my magnum opus
The magnum smoking
. I’m safe
Like when the magnum open
What y’all promoting, sex, lies, and true religion
Now how ironic them jeans ain’t got no true up in em
No Wu up in em, no DNA won’t see the day
You crash my set Lil Mama no VMA
Meth is a threat zero drama, I’m such a vet
No need for checking my cuts (Nooo) just cut the check
Who want one, You’ll need Hanz and Cory’s Gunz
Graffiti some, we spray cans where Cory from
I dreamed I lost in a food fight and Nore won
Kidding so it shall be written the story done


Fuck you losers while they fake jacks I make maneuvers
Like Method, Sticking up crews, bumping some Wu shit
I’m all seasons goose down hoodie and snorkel
Whatever, whatever you want I’ll off you
I’m awful, unlawful, I ain’t the one to talk too
Thats word to uncle Ghost, I’ll cook your waffle
Riddle me down, I’m mentally that
Freddy the villain is here you remember me back
Felony killers or kitties. I chill and trapped in the belly
No telling me how high and they feel I be strapped
Waiting for murderers some type of burglar and chomping
And murder burglar upon us some karmas when the curb with
Turbulent, been a veteran what you still a virgin
Dangerous grounds, we stain the clowns I’m burgeon goon platoon
Some loon buffoons refurnishing, womb for tombs
Kaboom, you doomed, no surgeon you know


You could never break me down, I’m built for this
Crown fitted for a king I’m victorious
It's survival of the fit as we are warriors
For the red, black and green vanglorious
Godbody-Cypher-Divine, dangerous minds
Spontaneously combine, it’s the sign of the times
All things must come to an end, I’mma ball until then
No fade away shots I’m going hard at the rim
Might rupture my Achilles heel, chasing this hundred mill
Brake pads gone just lost my third wheel
On my last leg stay kicking like old cabbage and boiled eggs
Known to hold a grudge won’t stop till they all dead
Eyes bloodshot red bottle to the head damn forgot what I just said
Eyes blood, fuck it just on to the next one

Play the sideline, waitin for the right time to take mine

Fuck a peace talk, let the gun spark, on the streets of New York

Hold your head up, I'm circlin the block, keep your eyes up
Wise up, before you get sized up (TIED UP!)
Play no games, speakin on my name, you catch a clipful
From close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change

Punch the data in your mainframe, you want it all
I want the same thang, strive to maintain, live out my name
Hard to obtain, hard to explain, ain't nuttin changed
Leave the same way I came, bringin motherfuckin pain

And they test (uh-huh), but they forget (yeah) how the M-E-F is so Def (let's go)

Yo, uh, come on, come on, now
Big Meth attack soon as the track come on now
Zone out, with Sean Combs and Bizzy Bone out (I see you in the club)
And by one, I'm gettin' thrown out
Mami, got her toes out, ain't one army can Blaze Johnny
Like Gwen Stefani, you know there's No Doubt
I'm trill, sick with it, it's like ill
That's the only way to explain these mic skills
On Homicide Hill, anybody asks is real
The more steel, the more bodybags to fill
Can I get, hit of that hydro, nigga
I tried to quit puffin' before, but I'm no quitter
If honey show me her buns, I'll show her my ones
If the bed rockin', keep knockin' and I'mma cum
Want some, take some, I get it crunk
Speak junk, I'll slow up your road with speed bumps

When they play this in the club (say what?)
Go and tell that nigga, bump that (say what?)
Throw your hands up, like nigga, what? (say what?)
Ya'll don't really really want that (say what?)
And for whatever muthafucka, don't like it (say what?)
Tell that sucka he can get back (say what?)
Misdemeanor and Meth in your area (say what?)
Are ya'll ready? Come on, play it back (saw what?)

You wanna front, what? Step up and get bucked
And if your feelin' lucky, duck, then press ya'll luck
Ya'll got me effed up, over tracks overreact
Once I start, like a bullet, ain't no holdin' me back
I'm all that and two mac's, ya'll fakin' jacks
When I cock back like Busta Bust and make 'em clap
Here I go again, who blow in like whirlwinds
Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends
Got to get it, and when I'm gone
Ya'll bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home
I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones
Got aim like them kids in Iraq who toss stones
And I got drugs in my system, we thugs in the system
That put slugs in victims, Mr. M-E to F, bomb threat
As long as I ain't no game, there's no contest


Ticallion is phatter than your fattest chrome chain
I guess that should explain why I given the dope name
Ain't nothin' free, everything got a fee
How the fuck you got a car and ain't got a pot to pee?
I'mma grown man, so I do grown man things
Why take half, when I can have this whole damn thing?
It's Meth, baby, drop top, navy Mercedes
I'm number one like P.E. or Tracy McGrady
It's all good, everything I spit, all hood
And if ya'll gave me one wish, niggas, I wish ya'll would

There go the apple of my eye, my black butterfly
Don't try to pass me by, like you do them other guys
You do with brother's lies, about they baby mothers & they wives
And how you need they ass to survive
I ain't a bit suprised, and I ain't try'nna give you bad vibes
You probably had a bumpy last ride witch ex
Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest
Until you got that order of protect
Girl, I'm far from a threat
, boo, now hold for a sec
Relax with the Meth, take a load off your breast
If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose
Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes
Girl, that's how you lose
Before you play the game, know the rules
Cuz still ain't nothing changed but the jewels
You still paying dues, when we should be laying on the cruise
Some icecubes, playing with ya boobs, knawmean

Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
Cuz you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride
Let's ride, don't trip, got your back, I'm your man
I keep it G, like they do it in the hood, and
You give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real, then let's ride

Hey, pretty ma, you look sweat, I mean
You the type of treat, I've been dying to eat
I see them other dudes try'nna speak, flossin' them jeeps
They wanna whistle & beep when you crossin' the street
Have mercy, to these big hands and big feet
Use me once and use me again like fish grease
Body perfect, primadonna, oh my god, mommy, work it
Make a nigga wanna get a job
I love chicks to hate staring, hate man sharing
Hate it when a bum bitch is wearing what she wearing
Huge attitude like the size of her badunk
Double XL, she the ""Eye Candy of the Month""
Johnny, but ladies call me Big John Studd
Is it my big club or my big long hugs
Go figure, if you got an itch, I'm ya nigga
To scratch it, and bring the hook back while I'm at it, now pass it


Let's ride, I start up on your right
Peace and then we'll fight
I'm starting to fall for love
Yes, I will, yes, I will
Let's ride, don't need to think twice

Got these wanna-be gangstas, sleeping with they lights on
Shook up by the python, everybody got they eyes on
Not only is the streets watching, the streets is talking
And word has it that these rappers don't come around that often
Take it from the most slept on, you're wearing open-toe sandals
And I'm looking for some new toes to step on
And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up

Yeah I’m Uncle Murda from the jects
Yeah I’m disrespectful, but get a lot respect
When I’m waving the tech, you better protect your neck
Got em looking like Inspectah, the way their hitting the deck
I with the METHOD man, its feelin like the 90’s back when my tech use to jam
18 putting pressure on these chumps, sending niggas that’s in their 30’s to go & get my dutch
Cash rules everything around me. I’m cookin a brick
Feelin like the chef, wearing my Cuban linx. I was ODB, creepin with dirty ho’s
Bumpin 36 chambers with 36 ho’s
Fuck the world, don’t ask me for shit
This that Brooklyn, Shaolin Big & Meth shit
This that shit you bump, before you catch a body
NY back on their shit. I hope these niggas copy

Show some respect when we come through

Thinking niggas plotting on hairs, think they not when they is
This is 
Staten Island

And I ain't found a court that can judge me, the block love me

Fitted, nine inches bigger than yours
This Meth dude got that food, and he serving it raw
Told you before, 
I bring the pain
, and now I'm hurting them, pa
Hurting them, pa...

Up from the 36, back on that bullshit
Okay, I'm reloaded, strapped with a full clip
Staten Island's the borough, Park Hill, we still click
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, that's the Clan, we run shit

Aiyo, you fucking with some capital G's, Allah Math
Streetlife, Meth Man, plus the Masta and me
Soldier I, make it happen, indeed, my sick gift
Had the highest paid ho, get it cracking for free

Like the twenty inch woofers, that's in back of the V
Leave ya brain, like you spazzing on E
It don't matter who you happen to be, nothing swagger like he
Keep a dirty cop close, never talk with no feds
Tear the roof off the mother, right along with ya head
And I ain't talk unless she talking bout bread
You would swear that I'm rocking New Balance, how I'm walking the ledge
Son, I'm just a little off of the edge, as I stalk
The mean streets, for 
paused
 types, callers are read
Killa Hill where the warriors bred, I'm a 
Resident
Patient,
 it's gonna take more than the meds


Special invited guest, I came to put the rumors to rest
Rip the rest of the slugs through your chest
Put the chest to the back of your vest
Trap your packet, take the money and jet
Niggas posted, but you posing no threat
Punk, you pussy like the opposite sex
Front, see how many shots you will get
I'm not asking, I'm demanding respect
I'm just a man to respect
Watch your step, son, your funeral's next
Streetlife is the man in the flesh, I got one hand on your neck
The other hand is attached to the tech
Your next move could mean life or death
Make move, take baby steps
Hold that thought, nigga, save your breath
We hold courts, in the streets, we rep

I’m like Thor’s brother, so low key
I might swing a hammer

Put a shooter where Ko - be
Tell ya like somebody done told me
Never trust nobody who owe me and any wife is a trophy
If Meth the mortician, you know that shovel is on me
To put em in the earth, I do my dirt all by my lonely

I’m all about the Benjis
But that bring jealousy and envy
Don’t trust niggas, they smile it seems friendly
I’ll be damned if I pass up
It’s for bricks when I mask up and run down
On em to get my cash up
Cash Verrazano J Reeds is getting lined up
Sam Rothstein when I lean slump with the 9 tucked
Come and take a trip to the dark side
Fuck around with pigs, they gonna find your body hog-tied
No guys saying they neutral but playing both sides
Homicide housing young cartel with dope tides
Your boy ain’t playing a little
Have em engraving a tombstone with your name in the middle

Fugitive on the run, felony warrants
The police, kicking doors, question all the informants

Blunt in my mouth, gasoline draws on
Vocals, got a laser beam, no other option for you
Die or embrace the team, offers that you can’t refuse
Handz On music, motherfucker, yeah say it with me
Now get your smart phone hater and take a picture with me
Consigliere, no phones, Jimmy whisper to me
Ride ’til I win the war, Cops put a clip in me
Carlo’s, got killers on the payroll, 
Killers on the lay-low
Killers that will kill when I say so

There’s a war going on outside, nobodies safe from

A politicing with these clowns, bout to shake something
I’m gonna hit em with the pounds, that’ll break something
Y’all better run and get your boots time tight black
Y’all fornicating with this money, get your life rap
Straight music, motherfucker cause it’s like that
I come and hit em in the dark, call it nightcap
And I be fucking with the starks, he my ace boon
Don’t let us catch you in these parts or we gon' bake rooms
And yo them cats you running with, yo they some fake goons
I’m bout to sweep em in the finals, gonna shake brooms
The situations getting chunky, tension mad thick
Like you could cut it with a knife, cloak and dag’ shit
Hanz baby, PLO on some Arab shit
My killahs coming with them cannons, bout to blast shit

Streetlife chip off the old block, the hard rock
Apply pressure to your neck ’til your heart stops
Got ‘em all lean like codeine, microphone fiend
I’m an addict, I’m addicted to rap cream
New day is dawning but I’m stuck in my old ways
Gave you fair warning, 
I’m reloading, okay?
I ain’t gotta say it’s on, pop up at your front door
Early morning, guns drawn, like ding dong

Cash, I get it up, my niggas, I can’t get enough
Won’t stop rocking ’til I’m sitting up on Diddy bucks
A semi tuckin, witty fucker, picture getting city stuck
This city buck is sick of flipper, motherfuckin’ city bus
Big whip, coasting, throat stroking, slow motion
Slow groove, so smooth, old school, Billy Ocean
Caribbean Queen, mean body, Dereon jeans
Cherry bomb, the way she blow me, she like  dreams

In apparel, keep us camouflaged in the shadows
That's where I bring this tale that you never get to tattle
Obliterate the tri-state, and the crime rate
Tell them swine niggas fly straight,
 you can call it fate
And if it ain't mine, call it fake, bottom line
End the case, spoonfeed the track just a taste
Of the side dish, soup of the day, 
I come Wright like N'Bushe
For them Dead Presidents
Fuck what you say, and he say, and she say, and they say
Vacate the premises, caught up in the melee
Sentence this song, to twenty-five years hard labor
In the system, where it takes the form of my wisdom
Respect mine, take my time and protect nine
Next on the frontline, Mr. Meth
No more no less, what you see is what your ass get
Set it off I suggest
There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything.. anything.. anything.. anything..

And niggas love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm, I'm not a gentle, man
I'm a Method Man
Baby, accept it, utmost respect it

Stop, look and listen

Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop duke left Mom duke
The fagot took the back way
So instead of making hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritating like the hiccups
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches
It's the Praying Mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfucking rap phenomenon

I shows up then leave tore up, ain't nothin' changery
One too many Kamikazes, I'm a zombie
Stumblin' out the party, I was duckin' paparazzi
I shoulda skipped last call and hit the herb spot
Or hit the studio, maybe, because this verse hot
My first shot, my bird hot, by the third shot
Curved the THOT, the thirst real but her purse not

Crooked Letter I,Tical 0: The Prequel,2004.0,"Ooooh! We have returned
Yeah, show you how to flow again (show you how to flow again)
It's the rap rule again (hehehehe) Yo, yo..
 (Method Man)
Street, Meth, we ride like A.C. and O.J. (y'all niggas crazy!)
I runs up on you in broad days, I'm a Loose Link
I carry's the Heaterz, always
Small timers, get left for dead in the hallways
It's that ill breed, move in warp speed, follow my lead
(Me and my Co-D's, about to O.D.) let me procede
I'm that O.G., you're not in my league (you know my steez)
I put the smackdown, on you killer clown M.C.'s
 (Streetlife)
I rock for all my niggas (I rock for all my niggas)
That's why I hurt to be here, okay, let me see here
Stat' Land
, crooked letter is I, we back, man
Harder than a dick on viagra gettin' a lap dance
Hittin' like a back hand (I slap y'all kids)
As if we in a game of spades, and y'all renig'
John Blaze
, not the clothing, cuz some of that is slum
(Son, I'm already knowin') cut they jeans mad young

In the Crooked Letter-I, it's do or die
Shit, every man fights to stay alive
In the Crooked Letter-I, you should not try
Meth Tical, Streetlife, Killa Bee, why..
 (Streetlife)
Stingy with my dough, even stingier with dojia'
(Told y'all) You'll never go broke, long as I yo'ya
Maintain your composure, or party over
For stank bitches, who get it, twisted like yoga
Holla for a dollar, yea, and y'all ain't gotta go home
(But y'all gotta get the fuck outta here)
Who stay ""Lo"" like Jennifer, won't see me a lot
But when you see Vivica, tell her she a ""Fox""
 (Method Man)
We rollin', big truck, sittin' on chrome (twistin' a bone)
Talkin' to a bird on the bat phone
Zonin', out the area, roamin'
The closest you could come to my style, maybe, is clonin'
The omen (I'm warnin' you now!) Niggas is holdin'
Run up, watch me put one up in your colon
Chizzle town, thugs in the club, like chicks posin'
Lambchop niggas is sheep in wolf clothing

 (Method Man)
Beware, danger, shoot off your flares
Warn all your dogs (tell 'em we here)
The Stat' (we don't bust our guns in the air)
Never that, y'all don't come out til the coast is clear
(Who you suppose to fear) Street, I fears no one
You all thumbs, I probably murder you with your gun
When I start lettin' off (niggas is jettin' off)
You straight chicken broth, we holes in your terrycloth

Double O, 3, long time no see
Who mind parts seas, and cause blind to see
Some think this industry is just all rhyme and G
Then he make it to the door, and he can't find the key
Don't know what it be, to make y'all follow my lead
Or make this pretty thing on her knees swallow my seed
If rap wasn't rap no more, what would it be
I don't know, I'd be zonin' sometime, must be the weed... that's that shit

Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you

Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cuz we above

Yo, uh huh uh huh
Staar
Surround sounder, blunt smokin, remy downer
Hip-hop sizzar slingin my raw in your flounder
You get skidawed, undertakin' undergrounders
This lyricist, lounge with low, that be lounger
Aliens is out of townish, fuck applause
Niggas clap now with forty pounders, and fourty-fours
Is it all, fair in love with war
Young 'uns with guns, acting like they taking yours, uh
Live by the sword, they gonna die by the sword, uh
My vocal cords break the laws that apply to nature
Low and these niggas love to hate ya
Request the henney straight no chaser
Twin towerin' I skyscrape ya
Now gimme yours

Trifled disciple, arch rival reppin with weapons that homicidal
Star leaves you marked from the start like tribal scars
(Allah punk) I'm hazardous as a bomb and arms spinnin' like Christ
Recitin' psalms in the streets of Babylon
(Verbs I gather well) ??? data shells
My squad camoflauge your wealth
Like the bible with parabels
With the navigator, spittin razor sharp, breath laser data
That'll tickle you now, but sway you later

On this one call me Lee Major
Million dollar man, bionic or proffesor chronic
Still not a player, I just fuck alot the panty raider
Get shortys mad, they curse you wild on your sky pager
Stankin' ass

Yo Mr. Big Mouth, better duck down or bite the bullet
You niggas got guns but you scared to death to pull it
Bet if I pull my gun I'm gon' squeeze
I'm startin at your head, son, and stoppin' at your knees
I hate your screwmugs, rumble counterfeit thugs
Niggas want mine, bet they come and get it in blood
Fat potential, gave birth to a corrupt mental
Foul thoughts paralyzin temples, it's just that simple
Chorus
You better come with your best gun
Niggas be holdin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be bowlin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now

Best to come with your best gun
Niggas be rollin', it's all war no fun
Niggas be holdin', you niggas under pressure now
My squads down for whatever with whoever now
Let's get it on

Arm leg shots to hit the spot like a four fifth Glock
We got this hip-hop shilock and all you clique got
Was lip lock, heavy heat, steady street sweepin your peeps
Hawks, machete chops puttin' cease to your petty fleets
This raw rebel got more metal than pop
And rock groups, when my Glock shoots the scores settled
A ground attack, I'm bound to clap rounds of rap
Clowns are found flat, face down around the map
Simple minds, cripple smiles, my rhymes are four five
The size oh two nines combine, can't even tickle mine

I told you once, I told your ass a thousand times, chump
Body in the trunk, stay in line punk
Fuck wit me and mine

Yo
You be the actual, sixteen bars, comin' after you
Never go against my team, they might embarrass you
Slit-slang terrorist talk, fully armed
Put your hands up, I'mma put a hole in your paws
Ruin your side show, eyes low, brains fried from hydro
Two choices, bass off or either die slow
We all scholars when it's time to clean a dirty dollar
Attack the boards, it's like a rotweiler

Niggas comin out they shoes like they Usher
These motherfuckers on the run, and they socks from
The bounty hunter, Iron Lungster, rain and thunder
Here come the lightning now I'm strikin' back at niggas bitin'
Pushin' buttons just to step away from self-destruction
Inch and a half away from touchin' somethin'
Suckin' away from bustin'
Yall brothers laugh now and cry later
I rap from Alpha to Omega, sixty four to Sega
Whoopin' that ass, walk you dogs through the lookin' glass
Been burnin' MC's since cookin' class
Makin' it hot like the summer in the crackspot
With blacktops, my nickle slot, triple bar, hit the jackpot
On each block, I'm the remedy, send them back to me
After detock, shorty got knuckles in the Reebok
Plus we got a problem with the Benz
(What's the problem with the Benz)
She want the six-hundred, but she ain't got the ends

Pick my ho's with the same finger I pick my nose with
These flows get, hotter than most chicks, get the picture
I'm focused, got nothing but cock for cock-roaches, bitch, I'm gone before you noticed
Ducking these coppers, try'nna make the coldest
Spot you with the bricks and the baking sodas
Me and my soldier, we taking over, taking 
payola
From all these stations and record labels, they killing culture, tell 'em niggas
""Walk on""

Yo, 
I blow ya minds, like Kurt Cobain
My block is hot like Lil' Wayne

I'm ready, hip hop is not gon' be the same
Like the Roc and Dame, I'll dot the little change
Nigga, I ain't scared, boy, yes sir
If I wasn't a beast, you niggas wouldn't whisper
I'm like, y'all can fuck y'all self, I'm getting paid daily
Plus keepin' it real, keep you broke, can't tell me, nigga ""Walk on""

Huh, now go say that I don't quiver, and any chick
Caught with dirt under her nail's a gold digger
Yeah, I tell the people, like I told RZA
Man, I got Meth and on the day that I don't, I'll let you know, nigga
Nah, no carbon copies, they ain't got me, but they can watch me
Jewels jingling, middle finger at paparazzi
Not too cocky, but still, ain't too many niggas can top me
So bounce you foes and pull ya shoes up, nigga ""Walk on""

Don't even blink, think fast, make the right move
Got a gun on ya, like Pinky had on Ice Cube
I don't play, homey, I got my stripes, too
I'mma sky high-a-trist, I smoke in a flight suit, nigga
Recognize, like Sam Sneed'll ""back down""
You sick and tired of wack niggas, then act now
I show you how it's done, nigga, 
Gilla House
Give you a whole clip, turn your ruby glitter out, nigga ""Walk on""

And beat ya feet up, I'm sick with these dice, so put ya g's up
Then back a lighter tree, about to get the energy up
I milk like double D cup, plus, I air it out just like a sneaker
Will win, and then ""key"" your car like Alicia
Yup, my Meth is off the meter, 
more Yankee caps than Derek Jeter
Try'nna catch me a diva, then I'mma catch and meet ya
Might spill a thong, but still a don, still got
Love, for my baby moms, we just don't get along, hold the fuck on ""Walk on""

Allow me to reintroduce -- nah, I don't need it
If you ain't got it since '92, nigga, beat it
Hop in the 4 of ya 7, black two-seater
Pull out a hammer, big as a vacuum cleaner
Nigga, I roll heavy, bitch, I roll steady
Get that dough Reggie, me fall off, really?
You better ask who the best rapper in ya hood
And when you mimick me, muthafucka, do it good, nigga ""Walk on""",https://genius.com/Method-man-walk-on-lyrics

Make marijuana legal, make marijuana legal (well speak your mind then)
Ok, I will, no one has the right to tell me what I can do with my own body
What I can eat, drink or smoke, this is a free country
And no one can take away my constitutional rights
Hey man, can you put me on and I can say anything I want
Is that what I need to do? (Yea)
Then why isin't alcohol made illegal? Why isin't that
While you drinking it, it hang on and disposes your liver
Besides that, it's a habitat for alcohol
Besides that, cigarettes are much worse than pot
No one ever got killed by pot (you tell 'em, you tell 'em)
God damn it, man, everything, you can get us anything you want
(Anything you want, marijuana legal
Make marijuana legal, what's so bad anyway
What's so bad about feeling good?
There's nothing wrong with blowing crack, yea!)
Stop, look & listen, guess who coming up?
And y'all was dumb enough to think that Method's number's up
Pockets so fat, they need a tummy tuck, you hungry fucks
Can sum it up, I give my money up, spit at a honey
Then split a honey Dutch, roll it up, can't roll with us
If you can't hold your liquor, throw it up, y'all know what up
See we them niggas, ain't no ho in us, the flow is nuts
I'm off the meter, momma wished that I was off the reefer

Nigga, trust, I got that Killa up
What y'all ain't feelin' us? Ain't feelin' ya
When half ya niggas posing similar, yea
Ladies and gents, I think this game need a enema, yea
It's ""common sense"", I Used 2 Love H.E.R., now they pimpin' her, yeah
But if you Enter the Wu-Tang, you tripping
Like somebody tied together your shoestring, now listen
I'm the, real deal, come on, come back to get ya like bad karma
Y'all niggas is throwing rocks with glass armor
Fuck the court system, pleading the fifth
And if Def Jam is deaf, start reading my lips
I'm cocky, possibly I got my reasons and shit
They ain't built a man that can stop me from feeding my kids

And if you don't know where I'm coming from, never know where I be in
Most likely, where ya start at'll be the place where you eating
And anybody hating on him, hating on them

In this business, you either in it, bitch, or you in the way
Sky's the limit, I ain't come here to play, or come to shit where I lay
Who in that six blunt, clipping his tray
Sippin' some Ice Water, dipping with Rae
Tipping these tricks, dripping for pay
And knowing half them bitches is gay
T.M.I. blowing tree in sky, we on the job
So be abvised, that wack niggas, needing apply
S.I., represent til we die, this track is pitching to fry
Enter the Dragon, I be spitting that fire
Keep ya balls off, so calling you dogs off

Topsey off the Limon Bacardi for sure
Loungin near the bar section, rolled the L
And kept steppin, concealed weapon, razor sharp
Blue star hatchet, in the sleeve of my jacket
Who that kid, on the dance floor lookin for matches?
Burn somethin, one toke got me blasted
Took another toke then I passed it, choke!
Fantastic, herb ain't no joke
Especially that indo smoke mixed with hashish
Ladies on the dance floor, shakin they asses
Got millon dollar broke niggas, that makin passes
Honey with the eye glasses, body work is Boombastic
Skin like blackberry molasses, mmmmm

Can't we all get along, without the ruckus
Got big bouncin muh'fuckers, tryin to rush us
I can take a hint, what? Can smell the stench
Of a hell bent environment, the odds against us
Back to the wall y'all, refuse to fall
All hands on deck yes, prepare to brawl
Uhh, every time I try to have a good time why?
Somebody always fuckin it up, killin my high, damn
Monkey wrench they whole program, party over
By that time I'm dead sober
In the midst of this whole shit fo' soldiers, dead gone
You can tell that they was heat holders
Everybody hit the deck when they expose tech, I fled the set
Bitch slipped and caught a broke neck, some Brooklyn kids
Rushed the coat check, they whole set, stompin Duke
Half to death and took his Rolex, it's horrible

Who I’m Iz,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You know it, just like before, muthafucka
It ain't never went no where, we still drink forties
Still got niggas that'll whip that ass for me, come on
The real way... yeah... another Rockwilder joint
Up in your muthafuckin' mouth, nigga...
Come on... put my fucking dicks in they mouth
I ain't playing with ya'll niggas, come on, come on
Come on, God damn, hit with the... with my what?
God damn, with the what? Huh, muthafucka, mutha -- yo, yo

I'm anti-everything, ya'll niggas is for
Eat up everything on my plate, then eat yours
Ain't got no table manners, I disrespect the law
Off that 99 bananas, disconnect a jaw
Throw your muthafucking hands up, never comb my hair
Never pull my pants up, I keep it cracking
For the whole borough of Staten
Got to keep it ugly, bloody sanitary napkins
Catch me on the 14th of February, actin'
Like I got no love for this whole world, smashing
Anybody asking, no questions, and answer
Pop another X for the extravaganza
Bong bong, can't nobody fuck around with John John
Take you rappers on and your man with them pom-pom
From Vietnam, from the phenom, forever mo', back like before
You see my Clan, see my M.O, act like you know

Who I'm is, at your crib, with his bad ass kids
Who I'm is, fuck ya'll nigs, we get down like this
Who I'm is, the phenom, them niggas can't live
Who I'm is, we ain't got shit, something got to give
Watch ya step, kid (huh), watch ya step, kid (muthafucka)

Watch ya step, kid (yeah yeah), watch ya step, kid (yo yo)
Watch ya step, kid, watch ya step, kid (cook a bag of 'dro)

My middle name Mud, dirty water flow
Leave a ring around the tub, grimy mothafuck
Kid, I don't give a what, if you feel like I feel
Throw that third finger up to the sky like such
Follow this, funky like some staircase piss
Take a wish, breeze you when your track run sniff
Off the snow, that's the only way I can grow
We them kids in the back, yelling ""wack"", at the show
Looky here, I'm steppin' to the game, like it's my rookie year
Home court advantage, two blunts, one beer
Beware, I'm from a place, where
They pop for that CREAM and that bling bling, yeah
Jimmy Crack Corn and I don't mothafucking care
So react like I'm strapped, keep your hands in the air
Pain is the game, and it's full contact
I ain't got to say my name, let the whole world ask


Ayo, Rockwilder, this beat is off the dog collar
Hit Ja Rule at D36 tell him to holla
At your nigga, murderous flow that I deliver
Consider this M.C.'s last chance to reconsider
Their future, cuz ain't no future in fronting
My crew need something cuz we ain't used to nothing
The hardest M.C.'s rock the hardest production
Dick stay hard all day like when we fucking
Meth with the F.C., my disk's in the decks
Like the clip in the tech, and we risking your neck

Suckin' your mouth with a torn stockin'
Rapped around and knockin' , I'm creepin' when you parkin'
Shoot out the lights, darken the area, then hop in
Pick up my bigga nigga who helped me figured the plottin'
Droppin' the tops, splittin' the dough

Tippy? Tippy?
How high?
The Ultimate high
'Scuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of six pence, a pocket full a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture?
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Tical get, blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your house'n projects, I represent the Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes, 'Apocalypse Now', the gun blow
It be goin' down, diggy diggy down diggy down down
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigga finga all y'all niggas hit the decks
'Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcores
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam Bitch
Plus, the Bombazee got me wild
Fuckin' with us is a straight suicide
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Murder 1, lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breakin' all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
Fucka, we don't need no rap tour
I'd rather kick the facts and catch you with the rapture
More than you bargained for
Tical, that stays open like an all night store
For real, I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existence, M-E-T
Ain't no use for resistance, H-O-D
I bees the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian Musk use to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I don't stop till I get enough
Your shit broke down, light your flare
Since the dark side tears you into Hollywood squares
6 million ways to die, so I chose
Made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the rap
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
And yo my man, hit me now
(Tical)
Bitches use to play me, now they can't forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check Glock
Empty off a lickin' off a hip hop
Fuck the billboard, I'm a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your Billboard spot?
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the funk doctor spock smokin' Buddha on a train
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize, Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
How high? So high that I can kiss the sky
How sick? So sick that you can suck my dick
'Til my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on till the Ruckus get, home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We don't need your dirt weed we got a fuckin' O
Check it, I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screamin' for the antiseptic
Movin' on your left kid, and I'm methted, out my fuckin' dome piece
Plus I got no love for the beast
Hailin' from the big East Coast
Where niggas pack toast
Home of the drug kingpins and cut throats
(Hey boy, you's the rude boy on the block)
(You try and stop the bum rush you will get popped)
As I run around with a racist
My style was born in the 50 stair cases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, I'm the second one to hit it
Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and Glocks in ya
Enter the centa, lyrics bang like rico-chet
Rabbit, I brings havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin' blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smif'n'Wes
Punks take a sip and test
Who split your vest
The funk phenomenon
I'm bombin' you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama
Just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with, or played with
Fuck the pretty hoes, I love those, Section A Bitches
Hittin' switches, twistin' wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Diga
Boo, scared you, blew you to smithereens
Fuck the marines, I got machines
To light the spliff, and read Mad magazine
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya 5 times like US AIR off an instrumental
Look I'm not a half way crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks 'em up proppa
Ask Biggie Smalls 'Who Shot Ya'
Funk doctor, with the 12 Gauge Mossberg
Look, I got the tools like Rickle
To make your mind tickle
For the nine nickle

Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)
Couple nights shovin' hard by my damn self (Damn self)
By my damn self, out there by my damn self
I remember I was goin' hard by my damn self
My damn self, I did by my damn self
I remember niggas had me out there by my damn self (Ha!)

Break a moment of silence
I ain't dead, my life is frozen 'cause I'm goin' through it
Niggas sendin' threats, it's only right that I'ma hold 'em to it
I ain't scared, I fear for whoever say they owned up to it
We don't hold grudges, they just shootin' 'cause I told 'em, ""Do it""
Say the wrong name and now he goin' on a killin' spree
Get it playin' cutthroat, they don't wanna deal with me
I got 'em creepin' wit' these murderer intentions
Your hood is full of pussy, I be on it when the shift end
I'm close to the edge, so why you guys pushin'? (Woo)
Ten thousand strong, Leonidas got his life tookin' (Uh huh)
They say it's good to grieve on a full stomach
Droppin' the audacity of hope is what the hood wanted
Tryna figure out what's acceptable
The man behind the Cardigan, that album is impeccable
My niggas got the loud homie, if it's stressin' you
We lampin' in the isles, bring the papers and the Method through

It's family, nigga, break 'em
Just when you thought you had all the answers
We changed the fuckin' question

I remember I was goin' hard by my damn self
My damn self, I did by my damn self
I remember niggas had me out there by my damn self (Ha!)

I'm writin' scriptures, but they'll never quote it
I'll always tote it for any nigga who say he want it
A moment, 'cause my father never claimed a fool
A full breed in a pit of bulls
We ain't got shit to prove (Facts)
I know some niggas who can't read but they can stitch a bone
I'm laughin' at you niggas flippin' rules
My uncle Carl told me stick and move
It's young F.R.E.A.K. though
Got these niggas tuckin' they chains like I was Deebo
Ran through the Carter like Nino, just me and Geek though
On the set I'm sendin' 'em slugs to free my 'migos  (Shee)
This back block deserted like Baghdad
I'll be damned if they flash cash
Reps comin' equipped wit' a gas mask
See a killer but don't push me (Nah) and cash rules
I'm outta my mind, play with my grind, I'm on my bully (Shee)
See when y'all was tellin' stories 'round the campfire
We was havin' shootouts, my whole camp fired

Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)
Couple nights shovin' hard by my damn self (Damn self)

Another day in the life
Uncle Meth but this time I brought the family in
Murder was the case, you can't relate? Then you ain't family then (Nuh-uh)
Not even a cousin, Auntie Em or even family friend
Plan we in come with the ratchets, we some handymen
Got my nephew in the Uber with them shooters
Got my dawg on Eukanuba, put a shot through your medulla
I don't hate you moolies, just an addict for the moolah
To my cash rulers, never give a package to a user (Nah)
That's my position, opposition can't maneuver
That's a clue to why I'm sittin' in position to manure (Pfft)
No Kamasutra, get your karma, you basura
I mean garbage and there's clearly nothin' promised in your future
Look at this old head drippin' on a back block (Back block)
Rich, workin', like he whippin' up a crack rock (Crack rock)
Fresh out the pot, pack flippin', make the trap hot
And the family hustle kinda tiny but the stack not

Young nigga jookin' on the back block (Back block)
In the kitchen whippin' 'til my hands hurt (Hands hurt)
Foreign door, push got the trap spot (Trap spot)

Hey. I swear I never change
If I’m with you in the sunshine, I’m with when it rains
I’ll never switch, I’m still the same
Get caught up in the mix, I never snitch or give up game
I’m no squealer
Police be trying to pick the killers brain
Not familiar, that’s why some brothers go against the grain
I’m La Familia, I’m hands on
But that don’t mean the name I’m tryna fill ya
My hands strong, i ain’t trying to take your chain
I’m trying to kill ya
Orangutan, you monkeys tryna
Hang like you’re gorillas

My method is the illest slash illa
I’m trying to get the guap, cash scrilla

Frown up on their face leave ‘em bleeding, who want’s what?

The tool gonna spray
I suggest you stay in your lane

I bang with a gang, a poppin mind bangin up thangs
Accurate aim, well-trained, angle and range

SI Vs. Everybody,Meth Lab Season 2: The Lithium,2018.0,"Lyrical terrorism
Yo, yo, yo, yo

Me and my niggas, we comtemplate and puff sour
How we gon' crash an airplane into the Trump Towers
Freedom of speech, go grab your heat, then pump showers
Don’t want the money this time because I want the power
Fuck tracks, bust nuts through wack condoms
Carried the staff for so long, think I got back problems
Flow greasy, stack paper so easy
This little nigga stay here, open, like Cole Beasley
I'm at an all time high, you can't stop the feelin’
If my success make you sick, here's some amoxicillin
Six doses, beats is hypnosis
Meth Lab is open, bitch, so get focused
It's big business, we sellin' them plants
And nowadays I got more P's than Kerry Durant
And all the smokers called it dope, so we gave it a stamp
Dispensaries got stripper poles in case you girls wanna dance
One thing you gon' know about Apocalipps (What's that?)
Feel I take this whole shit 'cause I’m an optimist
You poppin’ shit, then pop a clip, get knocked then lock your lips
And if you snitch I'ma hit you in your esophagus
So I don’t deal wit'chu Dave and Busters
I got an angry little mob that'll smoke all of your dutches
Now, keep hatin' thot, eat a sausage
Minnesota or Cleveland, I’ma get love regardless
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool

Yo, we the kings of New York where cash rules (Cash rules)
In this game called life, you can't lose (Can't lose)
And don't nobody get it confused

Your better run the receipts, we pay dues (Pay dues)
We'll check SI live, we bad news (Bad news)
And don't nobody get it confused
It's Staten Island vs. everybody this time, fool

Yeah, yeah
My game patient, it's complicated but so am I
Patiently waitin', I 
Playstation, I'm so NY
My foul flavor, one word is blick and I'm fortified
Big bully, Michael Jordan wearin' a forty five
One in his head, if he ain't dead, he borderline
Dope, every rhyme that I say, go 'head and snort a line
Sublime, 
if you didn't know I'm a water sign
Whatever floatin' your boat, just know the water mine
Stick your toe in, the water's fine, I'm positive
And I'm thinkin' positive but I'm thinkin' the problem is (What?)
That when I'm thinkin' 'bout opps, I'm thinkin' opposite
Plus I still think I'm in my Prime 'cause I'm an Optimus
My clan on top of it
Gettin' poppin', we poppin' it
'Cause in the spur of the moment wouldn't care, just pop a bitch
Meth proposterous
S-I, no stoppin' it
And once we get the key to the City, boy, we lockin' it

Yo
Don't ever lil' bro me, nigga, I'm big homie
On Deck like Inspectah, yup, the weapon on me
Do not get confused, we just switched up the hustle
Probably took you a minute to get it, all muscle
Hit that emoji, these rappers is phoney
They'll kill for some of this DNA, but you can't clone me
This is God given, hard livin', Mars' vision
You new niggas can't really rock to our rhythm
Nope, this is massacre music
This is Meth Lab, a death jab, let's back into it
You tired of the producers dancin' all in the videos (Then what?)
Then come to Staten Island you little silly hoes
They see me go back, you see Sparks like Omillio
Young legend gettin' this young money, a milli, though
And I don't throw shots, nigga, I shoot 'em
I still white tee, Yankee hat and Timberland boot 'em (Let's go)
This is easy work
Probably see me in the street promotin' peace, still do you greasy, jerk
I been bangin' since Meth was on that stoop with Mary
I was loungin' on the low when the hours were scary
Everybody was choppin' back and forth 'cross the ferry
These bars are one on one, try not to compare me

Staten Island vs. Everybody
There is no competition

Don't crowd my mic, alright, give me room
And I'll show you holmes, how a Meth should be born

On the trigger

Even on Christmas Eve, I out rhyme whoever rappin'
Slime, shoulda tapped in (Uh)
But he blind to the facts and, um
What the album, track one
Time for some action (Haa)
Past time for the last time I rhymed in this fashion
True Religion, he never thought he'd die in his fashion
But I got time today, if you dyin' then ask him (Uh huh)
Bars, forensic science, that's if you tryna catch 'em
Lord, I think I'm over it, I ain't over here actin'
I say it over and over, I ain't overreactin' (Woo)
What you picture is death, I'm just closin' the caption
Who knows if I'ma blow, I just got my nose in a napkin (Choo)
Super Saiyan, technically, I'm electrifyin'
To be specific, what I specifically specifyin'
See that's progression and I'm especially rectifyin'
Any confessions, I don't expect to be testifyin'

So pure now, killa, ain't nothin' gon' move
Meth Lab's back (We're back!), pardon the goons
Back in the kitchen with it smellin' of fumes (Smell it!)
Charged water, hard crack wit' a spoon
Staten Island, straight up, fuck the platoons (Fuck 'em!)
Heard the meth heads callin' you
Meanwhile it's mumble rappers soundin' kinda foreign (Soundin' foreign!)
Find 'em pressed with Molly, tourin'

We either gettin' live, edit that (Edit that!)

Y'all live stream and think you litted
Ain't seen a face to face in a minute (Nope)
Call 'em exquisite, come and crumble your waves
I got that lithium for days
Homie, sharpenin' blades, yuh
It's Mr. Parker, he get sharper wit' age
Be at your door with the beard, I ain't talkin' no raids, fuckers
Black mufflers got the cowards afraid
We make the situation grave
We'll better dismantle your trades, nigga

This is no glove hittin' the bar, bill open hand, callous slap
Rough, ashy knuckles spark, split your face rap
The quick loose your tooth jab, the fifty two clap
A hunnid rounds backin' 'em down, the house trapped (Uh)
We still keep a bat in the back, the the bone crack (Uh)
Still spittin' actual facts for bank stacks
Cue ball in the sock from the pool rack, snap his neck back
Every time I think I'm out, I get pulled back
It's like I relapse and catch a flashback
I took the contract to kill an emcee (Uh) so masterfully
So who better than me since '93
Get you tied to a tree as a target if you wanna be

Yo, I'm a old young nigga (Uh huh), I do it for sure (What?)

How I break 'em like a bad habit, hit tracks like it's target practice
Then let these darts take a stab at it
Niggas ain't got it, ain't never had it

And the passenger seat behind the field
It's your boy, physically fit, mentally sick

That the crowd, is either singin' to or fightin' along, fightin' along
I'm try'nna tell you drugs is not your friends
And girlfriend, don't try and front like you got your friend
I'm at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
And my chick's a man-eater, she be swallowin' men
Aight, live from New York, it's Saturday night
I got pipes that drain your confidence, and battery light
Aight, mami tight, but she ain't really my type
If ya'll don't see me treat her right, then she ain't really my wife
When I was young, I was stayin' in school, obeyin' rules
Play with my food, what makes you think I'm playin' with you?
This is it, ya'll better come on in, the water's fine
Jump on in, let's do it to 'em one more 'gain

Whiplash
, hit you actors with the drum
Ain't no actin' where I'm from, nah
I'm in Staten, get it done
I used to be a student, wasn't really into schoolin', I was truant from the jump
Kept it movin' with the Knicks, Patrick Ewing with the dunk
Beat bump, soundin’ like a body movin’ in the trunk
Pump shotty, got everybody movin' when it dump
Side note, if you a boss, then you movin’ where you want
I got high hopes, if you ever saw when I was broke
In the game since a kid, they never saw me as a G.O.A.T
Yet, I'm scorin' and feelin' like I’m Jordan in the post
Doctor J cool but now I like the coroner the most
Hanz and Sheek Louch, damn, they bar'ing the flow
Who am I to knock they hustle like a warrant at the door?
Life funny, I'm feelin' like I'm Martin off the show
I'm just tryna get this money, buy the Foreign off the show

It go to puma layin' hammers, cabinets finish the job
Big Barker, he involved, Doctor paint a collage
Still a student tryna shoot for the stars
Still improvin', tryna rape all the odds
Rap architecure, nice with the bars
Meth Lab 2, call it the deuce
And when you talk about it later, better call it the truth
The analytics, paramedics, pullin' up at the booth
I heard them engineers, pioneers, put series on loop
I guess them niggas didn't get it 'til proof
How them killas'll move
That's how them gangstas get they money, recoup
The psychedelic relics dyin' to shoot
And, yo, I'm built for the Borough
It doesn't matter who came wit'chu at all
And, yo, them corny niggas destined to fall
Hey, yo, they down to dilute
I'm from the Staten, Hanzarelli the Brute
And, yo, the boogie barker, same wave just a different saga
It's lookin' easy 'cause these cats is trakka
And, yo, when is all these rappers gon' learn hard work, far as music concerned, trumps talent
Yo, a point of return
Yo, bet your money, yo, I double the bank
And, yo, whoever lose could pay for the stank

Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something

Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something
This is what I’m into
(Verse 3 - Method Man)
I’m all about this caper, in the group with 9 members
I ain’t trying to split this paper, but that’s another issue
I ain’t rappin with you haters, send you back to meet your maker
And I bet nobody missed you
The island be official, without the striped jersey and the whistle
Put the pistol to you dog, Michael Vick you
Method I’m the Shih Tzu, It only take a word for me to sic you
I mean get you and them goons are going with you
(Chorus – Method Man & Donny Cacsh)
What you getting into, I ain’t doing nothing
Same old shit, making money, niggas frontin

About to cop a bag, get a dutch, and fuck something

Act Right,Tical 0: The Prequel,2004.0,"Yeah, that's right everybody get some act right""

Awww shit! Ya know the name
Who flip flows like chessboards, there go the games
I'm drugs to the brain
Even on the 14th of February I ain't got no love for a lame
Back doin' my thang, right
Livin' the fast life
Bitch grab a seat at the bar, get you some act right
If that don't do it then rock, lets bring it back like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Ever since I came up, rappers done changed up
Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up
Y'all don't think my shit off the hook, then y'all can hang on
I'm like a king that's so fresh so clean
I leave niggas like black coffee, no cream
Come inside the party fuck up the whole scene
(That's right everybody get some act right)

Get up get up, ya know what we came here for
What up what up, get your asses out on the floor
Come on come on, I've been away for far too long
Guess who's back and far too strong for ya niggas (now)
We feelin' good tonight, we hittin' 'dro like
We gettin money and gettin' honeys that flow like
My mic, my clothes, my life, my dough
(That's right everybody get some act right)

Ya damned if you do, ya damned if you don't
Step inside my Range and get blammed if you won't
My Clan in the joint, man we got it locked
Like whatever niggas got in the bank, I got it stopped
Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
In this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
I get tips from B.I.G. and Pac when they blastin' the heat
If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me
My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now you're stuck with me
I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky
(That's right everybody get some act right)


Extra, extra read all about it
Who shits they grounded, flies all around it
My trees don't doubt it, they green as a salad
All American Express I never leave home without it
I'll never go pop, Meth Man I'm bout it
Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded
I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it
(Damn right everybody get some act right)
Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good
(There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could)
I'm that boy in the hood that told Red Riding Hood
There ain't nothin' but wars in my neck of the woods
So! Who's ready for MC Whoa
What's beef?
 Beef is what I got teeth for
I eat up everything on my plate then eat yours like
(That's right everybody get some act right)


Stand up! Staten Island, Lond Island get some act right
Every borough
, New Jersey get some act right
Each state, west coast, east coast, dirty south, midwest get some act right
If it ain't well, it ain't right
If it ain't Meth, it ain't tight

Ayo I'm done committing crimes homey (I'm a star)
All I wanna do is shine homey (from afar)
Get this money till we tired homey (picture that)
I'll retire when we tired homey (bring it back)

Uh
What I write, fatality type
I keep it real but ya'll still reality bites
Go ahead and call it what ya'll like
Just get my salary right
I could tell em their paper thin but that would be lie
Tell a Judas to never cross me coz that would be Christ
We bout gettin millions with ice, yep that would be nice
I ain't picturing peas with rice, what you see is the price
Word to S.P. with rights and a gangsta's lean
That's promethazine and Sprite
Go and live a day in the life
Lose your life for you ends
You could spend a day if you like
That's a privilege, you see it like everyday if you white
Smoke trees like all I need is mary j. in a life
Boy please, pardon me it's like a fart in the breeze
That's a benchmark, some players will never start in the league
Look at me, real MC gotta start and appease
Plus my maroon fives make it harder to breathe

Leave ‘em bleeding out with his shoes & his socks off

War dancing. I ain’t trying to make it rain though
You slow gassing. I’ll leave you brain on your Durango
First classmen, old school with the Kangol
Thug passion, that pussy juice like a mango
Hulk smashing, make it jump like everlasting
God body Ramadan, 30 day fasting
Six two brown skin fellow with the Caesar fade
360 waves, side burns with a little graze
I remain relevant; I’m a raw element
High street intelligent. Product of my tenement
Son of Anarchy, smoking that Bob Marley
La la la be killing these niggas slowly
Wake up, smell the coffee, sleep on the street is costly
Pay attention to the warning signs, don’t cross me
Give ‘em hypertention. That niggas is getting salty
I’m quick to pop off back the fuck up off me

All in together now, chinchilla bullet proof
Hoodies for any sign of winter war weather
And daddy gonna get that cash so clever

Better yet, scratch that, ya’ll don’t get a pass then it’s on
We Hanz On, everybody watchin the Don
Got their eyes on the kid when they should be watchin their own
Telling lies on the kid, they said he’s not in a zone

The mad stola, the mad stola

Ha ha, nah let me stop
Word up this is a Def Jam production (Sandman)
Featuring, Johnny Blaze word up
Another Sandman joint, dirtman on the track
Flip the script, script the flip
Check the steez (believe that)
Check it out now, check it check it out

I get drunk off of cheap wine and hold frontline
Niggas wanna front, fine, fuck with me and mine
Rain on your sunshine
Swine niggas come as hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it, only five percent live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Peep the Stallion, half of y'all need to quit it
Frontin' hard and be soft as a cotton knitted
No balls at all, if you do son then get with it
Razor sharp in my jaw bone I might spit
I'm dealin with it on a everyday basis
Roam where it get cold at and stack glaciers
In the zone it's Tical once again stoned
Throw your hands in the air and puff a Meth bone
Did you ever get the feeling for that phat shit?
Something different from that R&B and rap shit?
Well here it come, from the gums of the one, I amaze 'em
Fire in the sky, peep me now, Johnny Blaze 'em, check it
My mind's on the rhyme, ain't a damn thing funny
Gettin' money, Blaze represent, kills the fraudulent
Fucker giving me the grill
Nowadays everybody trying to keep it real
4th Disciple, hit me with that 30/30 rifle
Beats from the streets mega-trifle
Rap gymnastics, flipping from the cradle to the casket
Take another pull, fantastic
It's the Method not the Plastic, Man
Coming down like hourglass sand, check the tactic
Flow P.L.O., P.L.O. now you know
The ultimate and rhyme legitting
Peep the counterfeitten or get snake bitten
Filled up with deadly venom, Johnny Blaze get up in 'em
Play 'em out like Lee denim, can you dig it
Can a brother eat, can I live it
Gets no deeper, whoever slipping get the sleeper
Hold, faces of death, bodies cold
On some Evil Dead part 2, swallow your soul
Yeah, and it don't stop
The body body body body rock, yeah
Hip hop, we sat out in the dark (in the dark)
We used to do it out in the park (Where that?)
Hill Avenue, ain't a damn thing new
Stay true to my Clan, I'm a family man
Loyalty brought me royalties
To the Gods I give my heart and soul totally
It's a bond can't be broken, that's my life
I'mma die if I think twice, I'm not jokin
To the essence if I'm half stepping
Politician use the system, as lethal weapons
When we slip up, lethal injection
Hah, everyday life's a lesson

And clown; Niggas relyin on special effects
While the khakis and chronic, got the bitches still breakin they neck
Move the crowd without breakin a sweat
Trend setter, with a Beretta, so keep it on deck
Cause you never know when Xzibit gonna move through the set
Don't be scared, just be prepared and quiet as kept
At a night club, talkin bout you don't go out
And you tryin to got to school and make a certain amount
But the last part, I just couldn't figure it out
I guess its real hard to talk with a dick in your mouth
Lightweight, like confetti, steadily tested by motherfuckers who ain't ready
To deal with the legendary
Soopafly, emcee, and bullett logo
Shot callers, clear the whole block like we po-po

Round and round we go, it don't stop
Till we all get dough, c'mon, make it hot
Baby girl to the pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop, pop!
Lookin good with your stink-ass
Type of ass make a nigga pull it over fast
Make it hot, baby girl to pussy pop, pussy pop
Lick shots for the pussy pop, pop pop!

Well, you gotta pop the pussy, get rid of the next with a name on your gums
It's the ?Bidulo Gang? bitch, we both want some
You got titties and ass
But I got a dick and some cash
You ain't talkin bout shit
Then I'ma smash, bitch
On three, on me, bitch, you my property
Daddy Jayo Felony, ain't nobody stoppin me
And I said daddy, bitch thats what you gon' call me
I ain't no simp or a wimp
I'ma motherfuckin pimp
Tear spots in my hoes, make they high-heels fall off
You got me ? the fuck-up, if you think I'm goin soft
On ya; I'm hard on my hoes that's how it goes
Bitch, get up off your toes, and get my six-four
? My name, you bounced, so you might as well break bread
And only Dulo niggas know, whats the head
My name is Billy Loco and this is my opinion
I'm coming from SD, and Dulo is my religion
Be-b-b-b- atch!


I don't save or pray, or ? clothes
All I really wanna do is win the game, fuck hoes!
In Jamaica, at the Half Moon Villa, with a killa
And a cocain dealer, layin low from the law
See it all comes down to who's quick to draw first
Pay attention, prevention, ridin off in a hearse
Mister X to the you know me
Thousand-dollar bitches wanna pop the pussy for free
The disfunctional member of the Alkoholik family tree
Frequently bang bitches, Wu-Tang, Killer Bee
Hennessey on the rocks, with Pina Coloda
At the Ramada, make you work hard like Donna
For the cheese, got you down on your hands and knees
After that we kick back and burn up some trees
Mad shout, cause Xzibit's not the type to be treatin
I'm an Alkoholic and I'm late for my meeting

My pinstripe comma deletes your power bar
Dr. Octopus tentacles, same as different song
Bob Digital instrumental, nothing's indentitcal
You biter, non-writer, Mr. Potato Head or Ida
Deep-fried crinkle cut, one nickel cup fucked your whole LP up

Perfect precision marksman, spit darts an, flip charts 'an

Mista pitiful, your whole shrap stack is dispicable
Undernourished, your shit cannot flourish
Cherish every moment of his love before you perish

Lookin for a bird, I can hitch, into your atmosphere
Take your pussy out like a pap smear
Make you smile, at the same time crack a tear
Smack ya rear, vagina saliva, Trojan wear, rough rider
Up inside ya, dick applehead, opens up your clit wider
Taste the apple cider, you become strong, then become a ?prider?

Burn one and sautee, bringin you different ways to sword play

To the midnight, butt naked wit a knife
Ask my alien likes, I've been crazy all my life
Hardtime homicide, time flys, do or die
Crooked ass and crooked eye, scripture from the darkside

Our rappers must be on that Lindsay Lohan
I think that snow bunny got 'em open
Your 'erb smell funny and I funny like we jokin'
Look, if it ain't about this money, don't approach 'em
If you do try and play, I got a K that can coach 'em
Pen game, poke 'em like an inmate enforcer
I'm for that, it's nothin' like a doormat, you're welcome
Huh, shout-out to Jadakiss and French
I got two French vanillas French kissin', that's a pimp
If my goon don't stretch 'em wit' the weapon, that's a ten
Little meth in your possession, that's possession wit' intent, bruh
It's a hard knock life, but we find a way
And we still find the time to write a rhyme a day
I'm tryin' to send my babies to college
Why you rappers babysittin' your pockets?
I want your life or your wallet
Brr, that's the sound of the roscoe
Mexicans is vatos, skinny jeans is flacko
That means I'm tight wit' you, I'm ready to fight wit' you
Please, and that don't mean I'm tryin' to be polite wit' you
Nah, see, I ain't even try and griped wit' you
So take your team if they ain't tryin' to lose they life wit' you
Back down while I'm puttin' this MAC down
But only for a limited time, homie, so act now
Bruh, keep it a hundred and a Backwood
Who else could think on an empty stomach? I'm that good
Far from the slave ship, just far from basic
Started from the basement, now we're y'all replacements
Rap star Belly, magazine, who sixteen?
Son, you all ready, headshot, all beggin'
Man in the myth, take a stand, any stand on the Fifth
I'm tryin' to hold it down, I hold the Clan
Get a grip, Lord, from this jump I got my hand on the ripcord
And I ain't tryin' to bite the hand off your bit Ford
Now y'all done got the Method Man on some rich border

What?  Huh?
You know
Huh?
It's like, you don't limit yourself to one thing
Your mama
Got to broaden your horizons
Broaden your joints
Keep your eyes on the prize
The struggle goes on
Eryday (ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
Eryday
And I'ma live it through my music
(ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha)
You know how we do
Choose or lose from it
Verse One: Method Man
Pull your shoes up, don't get stuck
Or get your frame struck, when my squad blitzin
Hittin like Mack trucks, head splittin paper written
In windy cities like Chicago, no bullshhhh
You see me spittin at the kitten with the lost mitten
As we engage in cold war gettin frostbitten
Once again up in these stank drawers baby listen
One mind and for one cause, heavy hittin
The penalty illegal ruffnecks, we bring ruckus
In pursuit of gold lines, can a n---a touch it
If I can't see ya can't truss it
A shady character like Buzz Buzzard
Lay him out like a plush rug-ged
*mimicking Brand Nubian* Now you can love it, or leave it alone
We drink death and puff bone
Draggin your body out the end zone
And any way the wind blow that's where you flow
That's why you be the first one caught, last to know
Body layin out on the flo', substitute
Heavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'
Third and long, quarterback pack the cannon on
I go deep he drop bombs, *whistle* that's when I touch-down
Six points, what now?
Once again who comin through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous
Ever since I came with this, and wrecked a body
You convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous
Offensive shotgun
Calm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun
Deep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game
You win some you lose some (uhh!) that's how it goes son (yeah)
You win some you lose some (uhh!) it's in the game ... (yeah)
You win some you lose some, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game
Verse Two: Ricky Watters
From the football field

You win some you lose some, it's in the game)
To the mountain, yaknowhatI'msayin?

You win some you lose some, it's in the game)
Freestylin, profilin, won't catch me smilin
Straight from Fema Island, buckwhylin, I'm stylin
A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
S--t locked down, like my n----z out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your earpiece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
And thrill, lyrics spittin, through my lips
Doin backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Watters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
The rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be?  It be I, the n---a with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb (boom!), guard your grill
It's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassvile
Drillin rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff
Another TV, and they loved it
(You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
You win some you lose some, that's in the game
You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
You win some you lose some, that's in the game

Got your crown and your throne, little castle you can rest your dome

Ridin’ for Outro,Tical 0: The Prequel,2004.0,"Three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night
The in-flight drug used to induce the hindsight was dust
The moonlight was robust but they couldn't see the beauty in it
Their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin
Senses and feelings distorted they boarded their vessel Nessel
Discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
To complete the mission they had no decision in
No longer do they use our light and dark hues to create the vision in our towns
But now they red and blue override our brown skin
We've been conditioned to let off them rounds when we see another color rag
Or, hear another brother brag about what set he claimin
Poverty, drugs and poor education should be the target
But we won't stay gamin that
We'll kill and maim another cat like there's no shame in that
Like there's fame in that
We hang out them car windows and bust them slugs
In the name of genocide in disguise, so we don't take blame for that
But if there's honor amongst you thieves in life
Then what the fuck you hidin for?
Recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin for",https://genius.com/Method-man-ridin-for-outro-lyrics

To the naked eye
Where them criminals
Better have your 8 essential vitamins and minerals
The wu is coming through you know the outcome
Critical
Condition in your physical for injurin
The officer and gentleman who stack by the benjamen

Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up care where heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch
In a white trench
Bustin off two macks I'm like ""I'm hit""!!!
I'm just playin, I clear the croud out

Ladies know who we are and
Dream of fuckin a star

Shotgun in this man car
Burnin up
Forever gettin thrown out the club
It be us Paul
Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know

I throw a 5 in the power
Poppa wheely with the front end hittin speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin change out the fountains at shoppin malls
Rats can only afford Chuck E Cheese
The blood in my jeans is tough like Buddy Lee
Semi-dart auto off ya, blood coughin
Meth pull the last spark plug with a heart pump

Call me will, enemy I state
When 4 Doc run the scam
New jacks studderin, that the man from the upperhand
Punch, atomic bomb I hit many
From Bricks to South Park you dyin with Kenny
While you bailin I'm trailin
Rockin hard hat helmets clip the satellite servallence
When I walk by you better not be kickin
Or I put two more in that terriyaki chicken

You've just been fitted for them seeman shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back
Kung Fu
52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots
I'm the has been that have not
Battle kids at Maxwell's house
Know when I'm good to the last drop
What's my name Meth he's name Doc
Just like urban
See me in the gran transportation splurgin
Drivin with a turban who push a black suburban (come on)
We rollin windows half down through the urban
Network law lay it down like a persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtain

Get out your car sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that filled with paint balls
And brauds got the nerve to act funny
You a champaine ho, with kool aide money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that town quick
You back down a point on nfl blitz

Blazing, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, 'cause I be that house over water
Forgot in the realm that be deep as the Poseidon
Adventure, niggas need to touch they freaking picture
For the sickness, that be spreading with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doing on my enemies
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, rushing through your down street vicinity
Blunt smoke, in the air reveals my identity

My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's getting deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas looking all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got the finger on the trigger of a pistol
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Then I add a snapple, nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
Then we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet the tent when I'm coming to your town
Black man, the rental, God, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from GLOCK then beware
I buck shots, we move up, the buck stops here
No more dough will be made

Yeah, yeah
One time, yo
Never liked son from day one, bring you tool
That nigga stick you and play dumb, hate a bitch-ass
Who care where you came from, you ain't prepared
For when the pain come, this nigga's scared, shook to death
From a cold stare, stunnin', knowin' my brothers fiend
To do you somethin' over here, we head huntin'
In the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin'
I smash pumpkins, hard rock be in the cafe
Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us
The last days, makin' sure I get the last say
In the food chain, is you predator or prey?
If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back
Crack your vertebrae, lookin' for a better way
To get my point across, thoughts accelerate at the same speed
Of the murder rate, Lord, never perpetrate a fraud
'Til my nigga Carlton Fisk see the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth
Life's a snippet, one way ticket
Time tickin' fast, blink you might miss it
Semen on street shit, you might catch fifty stitches
Body bag sprayed up, buried in muddy ditches
I play for keeps, bust heat you catch cold feet
My rap sheet, speak for itself, concrete
Evident, killa hill, resident, double dart agent
Secret, intelligent, my rap style's flagrant
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street life, deck and mobb deep, play for keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin' when you gotta eat, we hold it down
I move like Mad Max 'cross the wasteland
One hand holds the head of the last brave man
Made man, Cuban link chain of command
Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand
My live team turn the club to a crime scene
High beams flash, promoters die behind cream
Get your face blown, might face the chrome
We take this more serious than just a poem
I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent
About the foul shit goin' on in my life, current event
It's evident I smoke cigarette down to Brownsville
Thinkin' to myself, how many lives must my pound kill?
Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase
Hemmed by Jake, worryin' who might turn state's
So I chill, put my killa niggas on the battlefield
On the low plottin' silent murderer, never doubt still
Never follow beef, hey, beef follow me
Wanna settle it in the court? I say settle it in the streets
Like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it
Now you dry snitchin', because you got knocked with it
I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute
Stash my dough secure the funds of profit
Yo, extreme rhyme niggas, you wastin' your time
Fuckin' with my niggas, extraordinary line swishin'
Your mind out position, tryin' to figure this shit
Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this
Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song
Doin' this for too long, to not come strong
You're only a pawn of viet dong
Tryin' to form against mines, you musta just been born
Secluded on a distant farm, this is the real world
Where niggas get shot and shanked, where there's tremendous pain
You get your frame inflamed crushed to dust by the next man's clutch
It's infamous you fucks, intense bad luck
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street life, deck and mobb deep, play for Keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin' when you gotta eat, we hold it down
Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready
For a war here, fuck peace, what?
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street life, deck and mobb deep, play for keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin' when you gotta eat, we hold it down
Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready

Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye
Cheeba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle
Niggas thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught
A bad situation, cause I'm a sandwich short
Of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
Style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
Missiles, I be comin through like the four-nine-three-eleven
Tearing up the power-u, Me-Tical
A bad motherfucking Buddha Monk, what the fuck
Hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
Out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
Of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
A nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbing on my nob like an all day sucker

*bell rings*

I'm going all out kid no turnbacks
You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black bugging
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a concrete jungle, make the punt
Cause niggas act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggas stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowing
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop
No question, cha-cha-BLOW in the session
Bloodshot in that direction, cypher

Attack you like chess moves best move
Yo, yeah, yo
The boards, your ass
'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uH! *bell rings*
'Tack the boards like chess moves best move
At Rae through, comin at your motherfuckin crew
Live direct, yeah you better step
Gunshots ring on the set, let's jet
Motivate, to the gate

Come meet these killers in the flesh

5 thousand dollars on the love sofa
Stealing public houses with them love coca
Still love the culture and them bud smokers
But to my soldiers that cross line, that loves over
See I ain't never wrote a raps over
A loss cost but a win free, 
Situation fishy like some bad chocha
Or y'all just tryna twist me like some bad yoga

Park hills you know what it is
Nowadays I got bills and kids
Like bills in that type of shit
These niggas busy tryna keep it lit
Homie lying on the smartphone
I'm tryna tell em need to stop holmes
This shit ain't bout eating babies
And have em have me acting crazy

I'm too hot and still fire baby
And 2pac is still alive baby
I love my family cuz they mine baby

Whatever happen to them crack babies
Hello  smoking some crack maybe
And I don't know where you rappers getting your batch lately
Before you rappers, its a rap send in a fat lady

Do ya dirty call ya boss hog
Terminate em like a loss job
I see his death to all these fake frauds
I swear to god I'm so serious
Got me getting these guns if you curious
I said the stat and we the best
From killing out here to the west

Got labels calling cuz I rhyme slick
You, you never get the ring, you like a side chick
Ask berry crock where them pies trick
The dark knight and I'm back robin no sidekick

Shell shocked like I'm 6 months in the bush

Hiking in the snow with 40 motherfuckers expiring the blow
Footprints up timbs are wallabe souls
We cased to placed like Barnaby Jones, hoes
Lay it down like plats in ya hair
Ride off with your money then clap in the air

They skirt out my with Rick ran down tires
What a chicken I met who hand out flyers
Look I'ma areas, I don't have it

Bounce like box springs on your craft-matic

Kane’s Theme,UnKnown,UnKnown,"* This is an alternate take from the promo version of ""WWF Aggression""

Ah-ahhowwwwwwwwww!
We are... here...
To lay this boy... to rest...
And so shall you...
Be put, to death...

Beware of the six-six-six
So morbid and twisted I'm sick, sick, sick
Mad and sadistic, dark like sun when it eclipses
Grab your crucifixes and RUN...
From the hellfire fiend, The Big Red Machine
Heads get chopped in the guillotine, burnt in kerosene
Now you don't believe in the unseen
By any means necessary back to the cemetary
IT'S KANE!
Chorus: Method Man
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable (It's KANE!)
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable
Unstoppable, unconquerable - impossible, unstoppable

I rise from the tomb
A quarter pass midnight, full moon
The theme music kicks in, you'rre doomed
Soon comes the bell, it's me against you in a cage match cell
You get a chokeslam from hell
LOOK OUT!  Great balls of fire, no doubt
My flame can't be doused, this is what pain's about
Lock all the doors and the windows in your house
Night of the Grim Reaper, tales from the Crypt Keeper
IT'S KANE!
Chorus

Feel the tombstone piledriver
You hit the floor, thankin God you're alive-ah
Hail Mary take no prisoners and no survivors
Found scary like a convoy of drunk drivers, ahhhhhhhowww
Tragic, that old black magic
A-tisket-a-tasket, a coffin or a casket
Grateful Dead, nightmares that make you wet the bed
Visions of bloodshed dancing through your head
IT'S KANE!
Chorus 1/2

Sucker Mc’s,A Taste of Tical O (Part II),1995,"Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo same time same channel
Nasty vandals too hot to fucking handle
Bring the ruckus to all you knotty head fuckas
Shit's like Hammer Time, niggas can't touch us

Straight up and down Wu-Tang forever
Come tougher than DJ ?'s leather
Make a better tomorrow
Condition your atmosphere, air like feathers
The fire come, transmit vire come
The higher sire come, we burn your wire
Wu-Tang be number one...

Four years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Meth and it went this way
Yo, we took a test to become an MC
All the withers in the crowd got amazed at me
God threw me inside his Cadillac
The chaffuer drove off and we never came back
Meth cut the record down to the bone
And now I rock solid chrome microphones
Now we signing autographs, with cheers and laughs
Champagne, caviar, and bubblebaths, but see...
That's the life that I lead, you sucka MC, we G-O-D
Take that and move back, or catch a heartattack
Because there's nothing in the world the gods could ever lack
I chill at the party in my b-boy stance
Walk, cap low, 45 in my pants
Fly like a dove, that come from up above
My nigga's Iron Lung but you can stay one love
It's just a one two three a three a two one
Throw your blunts in the air for the god Iron Lung
Blow them right in your face with the bass
You messed up, come in first place, the real rap taste
First come, first serve basis
Coolin out boo, take you to the def places
One of a kind for you people's delight
And to you sucker MC, you know it ain't right
Bet you bite all your life, cheat on your wife
Run in a gun fight with nuthin but a knife
Bangin with your boy, slingin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
It's the one two three three two one
Throw your blunts in the air for your dunn Iron Lung
Smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
Come in first place in the real rap race
Go uptown, buy a bag of brown
You sucker MC, a sad face clown
Gettin OD ready to rock crowds steady
You drive a big car get your gas from Getti

I'm ODB in the place to be
Didn't go to St. John's University
In the streets of Brooklyn I aquired the knowledge
A Law of Mathematics that's higher than college
I'm fly on skins that I gets in Queens
She love filthy swine and my collard greens
I'm dressed to kill, you know our style
Cause niggas don't know that Dirty Dogg fly
If you wanna see me baby come, you know Dirty Dog is number one

Who on this? The Fenon, them niggas can't live
Who on this? We ain't got shit, Summin Gotz ta Give
Y'll done flipped y'all wig, blacked out the kid
Die and live for my nigs and my bad ass kids
Freeze , lookin at your ice like please
Plottin on the mouse trap, about to snatch the cheese
I heard y'all kids is 'bout that, psycho therapy
Fuckin, where the cow chat? Blue till they bury me
Never tell a lie, like George with the cherry tree
Now it's cherry pie, if it's not broke, let it be
Ain't nuttin nice in, New York, stick ya for ya cake and ya icin
All that tough talk don't mean nuttin when ya up north
So keep them hands where I can see them like ya want freedom
You know that sayin, if ya can't join 'em
Beat 'em and push ya way in
We ain't acrobats but we flip on occasion
Pick the Pace up, past snaggin, throw your waist up
Niggas writin slum juice with Jacob, fool
You're like dude, I don't like your fuckin attitude
Frontin on my Clan from Shao', we ain't mad at you

Yo, Starks dippin cheesy face, meesly pace
Ghostface, jump out the window for a little taste
Droopy luck, my main bitches call me lazy
Educated birds say, ""Ghost, you're so crazy""

Cappa slide thru with the Ghost
Post up like paint on walls
Drip jew-els, big heat ruffle inside the bubble-goose
It's the odd couple, holo-points follow you home in Staten Island
Playin with the big toys that make noise
Echo in the hall, a scared voice
Niggas start to act choice, but Dunkin 'hinds
Didn't know Betty Crocker had them two nines
Made the club moist, shattered the windows
Dust heads runnin, the black kingpin buzz the Black Jesus

Yo, the words you talk better be the words you walk
Body you in the van while the nurse is off
Put your vein out, watch me insert the dart
Till it bleeds from Bricks to the Persian Gulf
Light curcuits off, thirty-third if my brain is off
That explains why my language off
My gun aim and cough, y'all ain't trained to brawl
Y'all more like them training bras
Wet behind the ear, you're not prepared
For the project flow, with extra stares
I pass out a vest to wear (bullets'll fly)
Yo, a hard wire, startin bonfires
Pullin mask, so you know it's me
Your weave got more seeds than odb
Can't smoke wit'cha, watch Ghost tie rope to ya
Def and Wu will open ya

Your shit lice
Baby shake your shit 'fore your shit lice
Get rich like...

Word, it's me y'all
We in two sixes, flirtin with bitches
Dime plush, takin pictures
""How you doin baby, my name's Ghost
Don't get caught up in my chains or the way that I speak""
Seek intelligence, slickest nigga doin it since Grease
Check out the greys on the side of my waves, my crew doze on Riker's Island
Stretched out, malled up in the cage
Pull a? Out on Jimmy Jam, shakes Space Jam
Silky texture, Jordan jumped up like Clyde Drexler
All up in the parrot, nose numb, real as they come
Biggie's Versacis, Snow White rabbit
Hands is like photographic magic
Funeral love, boohoo when we hug, don't make it a habit
Hit the gym in two weeks, my back all chisseled
Elbows unique now, meet the new me
Ghetto fabulous, Tony Atlas
Zulu Nation in the 80's, in front of Masey's I start my own Chapters
Tyco, Nike glow, velvet pose
Special effects, high-tech armors, murk you after shows

Ghost'll hollar exbefragilisticcalisuper
Cancoon, catch me in the room eatin group up

Shoe fly shoe, Wally dark Clark crew
Fuck y'all wan' do? Crack a brew, smoke an L or two

You wet cowards, I'm live wire
Ya bitch ass probably wash ya hands wit Palmolive
Yo Bricks holler, I got the plan printed
Load it and it goes like summer jam tickets
Fam can't dig it, pop goes the wea-sel
You be hidin under your peacoat wit people
I told cops, roll blocks, no props
Fo' pops, Hennesy back and we both shot
That's how we go out, are you the thug type?
To ride down like Hopper from a Bug Life?
Watch the movie, haters tried to eye screw D
Your beef in small claims court, Judge Judy
When you and I meet up, the fight heat up
Bloody up ya wife beater then light weed up


I melt wax, Cuban Link chain react
Breezin through these tracks wit the highest of velocity
Play me like Monopoly
Pay me everytime you trespass on my property
I'm Dick Dastardly, no use in cop blockin me
Sloppily, your woman on the stop-watch clockin me
Possibly I rock well, somebody always watchin me
Livin in the street life, my eyes seen atrocity
Undress a kid properly
When I keeps it movin that means there ain't no stoppin me
Constant motivation, the god fiend bury kings
Proper education, Allah sees everything
How High, just another form of elevation
That's why I choose to build from the basement
Twelve-thirty-one-ninety-nine, times are wastin

Allah Math, break the phonograph in half
Promoters on some bullshit, short wit Johhny cash

So high that I can kiss the sky
Who wanna (kiss) be the next ass that's kissed goodbye?

I'm hotter than greese
And I got bigger fish to fry
In this cold world, no tellin' who's supplying the heat
Who put niggas on Elm Street and hope they die in they sleep?
I got my sword on, not a average sendin' me in
What oxymorons, this is where your ending begin
That's just a method
If it ain't, I ain't saying it is
Some call me father like a priest, but I ain't playin' with kids
Pass the dutch, my blood pressure that's what's up
And that shit that y'all was writing all day...
That's my nuts
Stay focused, stay in ya lane
I swing a hook like Candyman
If ya sayin' my name
Ain't nuthin' change

Ya know why?
Cause that tough talk 'ill get ya nowhere fast
Champagne bottled if ya go there smash
Hits after midnight and still cash rule
I'm lovin' Cinderella and her one glass shoe
I'm is what I'm is and that's all that I'm is
I've been spoiled, my kids called it like it is
Watch out now, who buyed his milk as a cow?
And his fat farm come with a hoe and a plow
That leave you sleepy
Defeat me, how?
You greasy, yo' bitch got a eye on her knee
They call her ""Kneesee""
Ten years and counting
It's been me and these two balls now
And we ain't thinking bout bouncing
The show ain't over 'til the fat lady sings
'Til then, I'll see more ass than a fat lady('s) jeans
Folks wanna picture me broke, watch the birdie
Then let's get dirty like Westwood and Jersey
Come on",https://genius.com/Method-man-the-setup-2004-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics

Spit in your mouth, piss on your bitch
We them wrist getters, everything real bout this, duke
You f*cking with them niggas that's splashed up, slave master's master
Dumb move, blast your slut
We want it all, living in Persia, burn something

Yo take that, drive that around the corner
Yeah, shit on your crew, nigga, it's Wu
Rap athletes, the trap sheet bigger than you
If you ask me, the Cash Rule
Nigga, eat that pussy, you cat food
I sneeze on the track, get at you
I'm sick in the head, I'm getting some head
If she ain't bout getting some bread, don't get in this bed
Real talk, mami, you gotta bounce
Wild like Indians, Al Capone-ians
Not from Chicago, my gun named Margo
It's only when we in beef, we humble in deep
Might kill four-five niggas, die in my sleep
I argue though, who the best, we hardly know
I came through in the S, wash me, yo
Yo, yo, do that for me, go around that car
Niggas, digging they nose, and digging they ass
When I got chips, can't none of ya'll dig in my bag
I pop shit, my killas is black, I got chicks that got chicks
My real world realer than rap
I'm hot, bitch, material, Meth, beyond lyrical
Wake up every morning eat that Captain Crunch cereal
That's that shit right there
Dick game super, grupa fish, Cris' Krug' lottos
I'm a bring it back, one wish
Fresh to death, I'm always, always Rae in the hallways
Yeah, always stay
Ya'll rappers gon' feel my pain, but the other way around
When it's going down, I'm gon' rain
That's my chair, nigga, get the f*ck out of it
Yo, f*ck you, pay me, if Dirt Dog could see me now
He'd probably say ""F*ck you, pay me""
Blowing smoke clouds, shit's crazy
Doorag your dome, get wavy, rap ain't done shit for me lately
It's ass backwards, this game trynna play me
I bet this never happens to Jay-Z
Get money, f*ck them haters, real talk
Pay me, play me, weigh he, just the right measurement
This may happen in a day, G
I'm a keep it real, for real G's, niggas is lame
Industry pussies, we can't feel these
Regardless that I'm paid in flossy, rich in the mind

And started backing lames

These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name

Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live

I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man
Repeat Chorus

Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines

Reporting From The Slums,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Should I, could I try to say
That I want you every way?
Should I, could I try to say?

Another pack to sell, another crack that got knocked in jailed
While others layin' with the daffodils
Fuck around and seen the cops was the ones busting
At your head, damn, little nigga, you ain't done nothing
Store trips turnin' into corpses
More sips of that Henny spilled, debts are costin'
Of course it's Yah-Sin again, makin' fans tremblin'
And skin 'em and, known to meditate and count Benjamins
Word to mommy or whoever maker
You've been climbin' up the stairs, I'm an elevator, tell your neighbor
That hater attitude is keepin' us down
They wanna know my secrets now
Everybody searchin' for a deeper sound

I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out

Staten Island is iller, off the island they feel us
Some people might not get us but they don't doubt that we're killers
The system tryna kill us cause they don't doubt we're guerrillas
He home after that body then we don't doubt he a squealer
The dealers, everybody wants nice things
The realest get murdered over money and dice games, I get it
If your trap life's a gimmick then everybody a critic
That's a nice place to visit but they ain't tryin' to live it
Raw is how I give it like UG
Cops be askin' questions like, ""Who's he?""
But I ain't sellin' no loosies
Brother when you walk in that room past, you lose me
That's why we never kick it like Bruce Lee

I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
It's gotta be a better way out

Sufferin' reality, perseverin' my salary
Trapped inside the drama like lookin' at Grey's Anatomy
Thinkin' of ways to capture the plan the creator have for me
It's principles when you the one takin' care of your faculty
Test tube, baby, the meth lab, the left jab
Right hook feel like I million dollars in X tabs
Gotta be a better way, llamas with me every day
It's goin' down everywhere, I'm laughin' while they let it spray
Real niggas' mamas cry, real niggas gotta ride
Some call it revenge, but still it's a homicide
Wonder how their father feel, will real niggas shed a tear?
Or do they only shed blood? They feel like they're forever feared

I'm reportin' from the slums right now
Another mother, someone just shot down
The way she cried was a frightening sound
Man this shit gotta stop somehow
I'm reportin' from the hood right now
Another momma, someone's just shot down

Got to get that part, baby
I'mma do it like this, baby, I don't give a f*ck, baby
Yo, yo
I walk in the spot, and I see niggas standing 'round
So I ask what's going down
Got a girl in the back, a blunt in the mouth
And a chain on my neck, hang to the ground
Hey, I said how you feel?
Baby look tough with a gangsta grill
I ain't rich, but I pay my bill
I'm like Jay, I'm trying to drop me 'a mil'
My hood tripping, chrome wheel whipping
With all these hoes, you can tell I'm slipping
Shots of Patron, got bird eye vision
Even broke niggas wanna learn my pimping
Yeah, yo, let's be clear
You're unaware what's in the underwear
She said 'yeah', I said 'yeah'
Pulled the purp' out and put it in the air
Aiyo, I smell something burning up
So I throw it up, and I put it in the air
(Tell that DJ, turn it up
While I roll it up, and I, put it in the air)
{Higher, we gon' take it, higher, watch me move it
Higher, we put money in the air} Put, put, put, put
Put it in the air
When I come up in the club, and I see my niggas on the wall
And I'm like 'yo, what's wrong with ya'll ?'
Got these girls in the spot, and I don't care if she a bird or not
Cuz I ain't really trynna talk to ya'll
Got a pocket full of stones, grown with a pocket full of bones
I'm a class act, I follow with the chrome
Lane switching, got your misses on the phone
Baby girl, turn ya head and teeth missing out her comb
Look, I want this money off the books
Little kush, and a Playboy bunny that can cook
You wan't the truth? Man, you f*cking with a crook
But these niggas want the juice, now they f*cking up the jooks
Jimmy Crack Corn, and I don't muthaf*cking care
Cuz the green is the only thing puffin' over here
So be clear, put this bug up in your ear
Meth and Doc put it down, yo, put it in the air
A dude like me, keep a boom boom in the truck
So you hear Doc rolling up
Middle finger in the air, to my haters, yo, what's up?
You can tell Doc f*ck shit up
Hey, nigga, I'm so hood
My hand on the pump, niggas understood
Bitch, I'm no good, I swear
Light shit up like Times Square, put it in the air
I got a bottle of Patron, I'm the only one that spent that cash
But everybody try to get they glass
Now we can all have a drink, if you trying to put some dough in the bank
But if not, ya'll can kiss my ass
I need a, Cinderella that can give me the loot
Better yet, a French vanilla that can give me the scoop
Oh yeah, just so we clear, put this bug up in your ear

Whips and chains, I don't wanna argue
The big whale that's writing fishscale
Like me, better believe, I'm too hard to harpoon
My goons, think like Chris Wallace

You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me I'm a make sure we
Be livin in the fucking lap of luxury
I'm realizing that cha didn't have to fuck with me
But cha did now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Verse Two:
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Rockin three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I can be your Noah you can be my Wiz
Then I can be your Sun, you can be my Earth

Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
When in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real
Chorus: (Method Man]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)

Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man
Repeat Chorus

Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines
Repeat Chorus",https://genius.com/Method-man-say-call-out-lyrics
Tim Westwood Yonkers Freestyle,UnKnown,2011.0,"Uh oh you shoulda give me this beat.. I woulda... What?! Hold on, lemme see if I got something for this... no no no no lemme see. Lemme see
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh uh oh. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh uh oh
Crime scenes, coppers and sirens, helicopters and high beams
The tensions is rising, fiends keeping their pipe clean
This is what life mean? A dollar and a dream everybody wants nice things
The kid was only nineteen, holding his chest now he's fighting
For his last breath, he's seeing death it's frightening
The grip on the ghetto is tightening, you try to do the right thing they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream, sirens and light beams
Firing off bad shots, hittin' people they ain't mean to pop
The neighborhood's in shock, block extremely hot
'Nother black teen shot that's a dull routine to cops
They shoulda got good grades, worked a minimum wage
Now he layin' on that stretcher with nothing in him to save
Keep it ghetto and whatever ghetto you at
Just don't love the ghetto, cuase the ghetto don't love you back

Tryna' be around this music it's therapeutic, first thoughts of the day it's so clear
When I walk in my head there's a voice that talks, in my ear I can hear it so clear
 You think i'm buggin right?

Listen, oh shit.... Yo
The average man wouldn't last that long
She like to work out, run marathons
She wear tight skirts with no panties on
She's a six foot one bronze Amazon
Singin', complaining all the good men is gone
I'm from Babylon, she reads the Qur'an
Visits all the jails and the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel, her smell was strong
With skin like velvet she rocked my bed
She gave me long head, sipping Long Island Red
She spread eagle at the tip of the bed
She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music's therapeutic to me, rap music's therapeutic to me!

Hey yo
You ain't lived till you made your first million
And top models wanna swallow your children
I thought I told you Wu Tang is for the children
Way before rap movin' crack in your buildings
Yeah, now what’s the price of rice in China?
These women tryin' to raise the price on they vagina
Me? I’m trying to live the life and get the grind up
Like Diddy, but I ain’t trying to give the Shyne up
Pop pop, pop-off no question, see Ol' Dirty, like it raw no protection
When the kid hold court, no objections
Meth needs his money at the door, no exceptions
I go hard in the paint on a rapper
I go harder on a pussy no Viagra
You think I’m tripping, ain’t into tricking
But keep a snow bunny in the kitchen
I’m the master like Killa",https://genius.com/Method-man-tim-westwood-yonkers-freestyle-lyrics

 and Method Man]
: Yeah, that's Charlemagne, who was in the house earlier.  Mad beats for days.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just get loose, do your thing.  Let me know when you, when you done.  Let’s go
Method Man: Ooh, that's kind of banging right there.  Yo, yo

My lifestyle's hectic—so what?  I need the duckets
I know that I’ma die someday, but I'm like, “Fuck it”
My moms know the way that I live, and she's disgusted
Just bought a pack of Newports and now I'm busted
Shit's going down, and I'm not one to miss it
Jelly upstairs to the lab and get the biscuit
Brothers making G's on the block, so let's risk it
Waiting ‘til they go in the spot and try and stick it
First kid I caught on his way to get the med shit
Had the loot tucked in his sock like I expected
Caught him for the loot, the drugs, plus the med shit
Told the kid, “Run or I’ll shoot.”  He got the message
Counted up about five bill’, now I'm staffing
Up the blocks with the crackspot, me and my weapon
Came through the back with the gat that’s off safety
Plan: get the money and run, and make it hasty
But son wanna pull out a gun and try and waste me
Let off two rounds, I jet, he starts to chase me
Duck behind a bush and vanish—poof, magic!
He ran by the bush, I jumped out and I blasted
Let three shots in his back, now he's a tragic
Case of what happen to those that got a habit
So when you see me coming on through, a plot get thick
Don't try to say that I'm on some shit.  I’m on some militant
What you wanna do?  What you wanna screw?
Who you wanna bang?  Yeah
I'm here for you, son, I got your back as long as
You keep it real.  Word, I got your back.  Brothers want
The drama but don't know how to act until the chrome
Pointed at his dome, head cracked.  Come on, let's keep
It real, no disguise.  Recognize I'm from a small town
Called Nigga Do or Nigga Die—that's why
I'm stressing that brothers keep their thoughts on their lesson
Resurrect your mind from the essence for real
Ill block niggas get rocked, like, by the dozen
What up, cousin?  I give a pound to my lounge nigga
Feast, my ninja.  Killa Hill, 10304
But the GZA got me wide, it's going dizza
Make my way for the Ooh building.  Now I'm
Chilling with my neighborhood villains, thug life.  It be
On now, hit the gun pow' as I murk another cow
Mr. Method show you how niggas do it
I studied, lived the life of good, bad, and ugly
Hard time caught a nigga lovely, but that ain't nothing
Before I die, I'ma leave the world with something
To remember me by, the real would be I for
You fronting, ass-out rappers to capture
I'll rip your world apart like a natural disaster
I keep it live, something more than ‘85
I utilize my third eye, got me thinking
Maybe you and I should get together for whatever
You'll never be alone, make it lifetime or better
And you got it now, we be lounging, Tical
Word, son, I like your style.  Ooh
]
Method Man: Yeah, and you don't stop that rock, that rock.  Ooh, yeah, and you don't stop that rock, that rock
: No doubt, no doubt.  Charlemagne with the beats

Hah, yep, and it comes back
To attack like the crack
With that monkey off your back, what you wanna do?
Fuck the crew, the F-U Man
Like my man Eddie, come back
Your raps is confetti, I tear ‘em to shreds, so be
Dread (*Burp*)
Burping on the track like that, come back to rap
Known to catch wreck on the set be the Method Man
For sure, Mr. Meth
]
Method Man: Haha, yeah, what?  Whoo!  I like this joint.  Who you said made this here?
: Charlemagne

Charlemagne, he's the nigga of the year.  I like his style
Oh my God, he gets buckwild.  This fucking
Beat is golden.  You said no curses
But I came back with the verses—aah!—like
Satanic.  Haha, get dramatic
‘Cause brothers got to catch a Craftmatic addict
Type of bed.  You ought to lay down and rest your head
And catch what I said when I bring
It back to the bozack
Grab my joint like that ‘cause it's all good in the hood
Back, back, back, back to my man Biggie
Smalls—he's the illest.  Take it
To my man Willis and Arnold, backbone
Of Diff'rent Strokes.  We was old folks.  Spread
Sin through my kin.  Ha",https://genius.com/Method-man-wnyu-891fm-freestyle-94-lyrics
