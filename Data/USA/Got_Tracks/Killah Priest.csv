The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

Life is a test many quest the Universe
And through my research I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving Earth
Life is a test many quest the Universe
And through my research I felt the joy and the hurt
The first shall be last and the last shall be first
The basic instructions before leaving Earth

Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was 12
I loved doing right but I was trapped in Hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying plus the praying
I didn't like staying 'cause of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up looking at loot, butt and thighs
During the service he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men
'Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia or the abyss
With no trace of trivia left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemns the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like the genie
No hocus pocus 'cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks, embroid it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide
The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

Life is a test many quest the Universe

The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
Life is a test many quest the Universe
And through my research, I felt the joy and the hurt

The Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth

I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the Devil fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye extortion
I quiz son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasian were really the Tribe of Edom
The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles and some are plunging evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness
Peace to my nephew Marcus

Thebes, city of lust and evil
Men deserve injustice
They deserve their cruel priests and evil gods, for we are vile
No more than a crawling disease on the face of the Earth
The grave is the only cure from our vileness",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-bible-lyrics
One Step,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"]
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
KP,  Iron Sheik
In these times we gotta take one step  forward 
Put one foot in front of the other , my brother
Yo, check this out

Early natives related to thrones of David
Captured by some patriots and thrown on slave ships
They stripped us naked while their wives picked they favourite
Lives were wasted in the hands of the hated
Driven from the Garden
Now we starving in the modern day Sodom, they call it Harlem
Worldly problems got us at the bottom
The Earth crisis had the righteous grab their ice picks
Seekin psychics for advices, I stay in ciphers
Our life is connected to the second son of Isaac's
Which had a tight grip on the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother
""The elder should serve the younger,""
 words heard in thunder
Down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger
Now it's cold in summer, the soldier slumbers
Behold a number
600, 6 and 3 score
The same as Esau, who ate his meat raw
In the time before
They climbed aboard a dinosaur
Information held behind the doors
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here
Then they gave us crack and beer
In the back of the stairs, please adapt your ears
Add or subtract the years
And form the unwise and watch the sunrise from sunset
None slept, one flesh, one breath

One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)

Devil's marveled, they caught us playing with the gold marbles
We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle
Before the Devil sold me to the unholy
He called my father Toby
, 
I live life amongst the lowly
The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Euphrates
Maybe they sent germs that polluted our sperm
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes
And told us certain lies and each day a servant dies
But in the halls of Pharaoh, the walls are narrow
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom
Now Freedom, let's feed 'em, feed 'em
They took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica
Promised us 40 acres and a mule
Treated like an animal, understand the jewel
Brought to the 50 States
Deuteronomy 28, Verse 68, it all relates
1555 is when we first arrived
We tell jokes with some get high and watch the fish fry

One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath

One Step, One Flesh, One Breath

 day
The day you will experience something 
Heavy Mental
Never done, 
Heavy Mental
..

Information begins gathering
Starting to pattering the Stargate towards Saturn
Between the eye socket is where I will build my sky rocket
You don't need any passport, all you need is a thought
Suddenly, the soul becomes hot as coal
The flame blows from out my brain holes like a volcano
The brain begins the process
As we start the conquest from out the physical bondage
The thought launches
Voyaging 144 billion light years through the shadows of your imagination
Now open your eyes, do you see the flaming arrows aiming at pharaohs inhabitations?
As we begin the racing like a sparrow through the narrow population, seeking purification
The destination is the Holy Land of Bethlehem
Eat lamb with Abraham and break bread with Son of Man
So slowly, hold these hands and stretch forth from the skies like a rubber band
As we begin to snap you above the land out of the atmosphere
Don't look back, why? We're 
Almost There
Just try to prepare and adapt to the air pressure
Now we searching for the mental treasure
Pleasure beyond the measure of yards
You can't comprehend a god or the distance between stars
Picking up quasars inside the radar
As we're going far past any astronaut
Moving so fast in this aircraft everything we pass get hot
From the take-off, the blast turn the glass into rocks
At last, my supreme task was to no longer walk on green grass
Until I become a beam of gas and travel through extreme draft
Unable to be picked up through cable
Out of the reach of all manners of sky examiners
Heaven scanners, giant antennas and high tech space cameras
No evidence in any cemetery obituary
Not found in any library or dictionary or encyclopedia or media
I'm in star mode
 
with the discipline of Damo
I broke the U.S. bar code
Now I'm on Allah's road to journey into realms of the cosmos
Where only God knows or goes
Blow like the UFO to give up my work clothes
Only to glow with a holy robe and explode through the mysterious black holes
Deep warp through the outer zone without a phone to the unknown
To sit on my throne alone, 
Heavy Mental
The pilot on this galactic plane of knowledge
Through culture, my sculpture lights up in ultraviolet
So you can see my brain is symbolic to a palace
Therefore, I keep my hair stylish
My flesh solid and my teeth polished
Next stage, examine my x-ray
Take notes for your essay and let the cassette play for longer than a decade
As we begin to blaze through the Milky Ways
Repent from our filthy ways, replenish from the guilty days
The eyeballs swell up to size of eggs
Neon dreamland, wing span 7 feet
Between my eyes is the beak
Destination of the riders to reach is the peak
Angelical landscape will take the physical man behind the hidden gates of space
Ultimate escapes as we go through a phenomenal rate
As we cruise going into magnitude
As we break up into a multitude of molecules
Going through a long hollow tube with a scholar's view
As we wearing the white garment
Passing sound waves that's supersonic
Passing the comets, star clusters
Changing my physical structure till my lips begin to pucker
Kissing Christ at 
the Last Supper
Grabbing the brass cup of wine, (
Heavy Mental
)
I feel myself getting older
Sitting on my sofa in the position like yoga
Till my mind passes over the solar system
My wisdom novas, I am the controller
I begin to loosen up my shoulders
Forming each joint into the Sun's 8 points
Then I begin to rise like helium, escaping the Millennium 2000
Meditating to the soft notes of a violin
I've been on Mars
Building the holy synagogues
 for the royal seminars
Long before they had the renaissance, there existed a Hebrew lodge
Heavy Mental
A phenomenon from out of the matrix
The world looks at me with envy and hatred
Just because I appear to them half naked
Rising into a spaceship with an arm full of solid gold bracelets
A phenomenon from out of the matrix, 
Heavy Mental

Now the only time - 
Heavy Mental
The only time you should catch.. 
Heavy Mental
Only time, you could have jet lag is if your cassette drag

From Then Till Now,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"Peace Killah Priest (peace, wassup man?)
Chilling baby (I'm with you)
Yo, I wanna know what's going on
Ever since that Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth
I wanna know what you gonna do for us right now
It's been a while baby, we waiting
I've just been chilling, been chilling
(I been in the lab writing and stuff y'know?
I just been on my, y'know, know what I'm saying on some)

Guns, shootouts and crack sales
Black males who pack jails, trapped in Hell
No peace, cold streets, surrounded by police
This whole week, buildings with no heats
No lights and gas pipes with slow leaks
Dog fights and lowlife throw dice
The whole night thieves creeping in the midnight evenings
We saw through the misty regions
Go to your house, take a vial for the demons
Moonlit, the lunar eclipse
Prophets stand in the midst of the seven candlesticks
I can't take it, beauty that was once sacred
Is now getting facelifts, fake tits
And fake lips, cold embraces
Memory erases, from the slave ships
My princess, I used to spot her from a distance
Holding my infant, burning incense
The moment intent for her to step into my white tents
Now we step in precincts for your ebony prince
The smell of frankincense, once treated like a Pharaoh
With royal apparel, anointed with myrrh and aloe
We used to wallow amongst the mallows
We had herd sheep and cattle, now we battle
Used to pass over brooks of Kidron
Towers of Lebanon, the pool of Gershom
We used to sing songs upon Mount Hebron
How is gold turned to bronze and shhh
How is gold turned to bronze
We was the wisest and the richest, now we turned to snitches
Women turn to bitches, in the time of harvest
We was the smartest, worshipped Wisdom like the Goddess
Now we act retarded, forsook the Wisdom of the Fathers
We used to have a thousand flagons of wine
In Palestine, now we drink Ballentine
And raise up in the violent mind
We used to have a hundred measures of oil
Eighty measures of wheat and barley, we live Godly
Listening to Bob Marley, before the devils robbed me
Chasing us through the African safaris

From Then Till Now
What goes up must come down
What goes down comes back around again
Where it all began, began, began, began
From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now
(repeat 2X)

Singing holy anthems, lamping with all my handsome grandsons
Hair long as Samson, inside my gold mansion
They used to wear purple Pampers
But now we Black Panthers, some are actors and dancers
It's funny how the dollar bill have my seeds holla for meals
Mother swallowing pill
Roads seem hollow but still, grab a bottle to heal
It's like a noose of seventh seal over Brownsville
What's the difference between the ghetto and death row?
I'm trapped up with kleptos, the Tec blows
I'm left to say a flow, where the cries echo
And echo and echo and echo and echoes
From the Crystal City, near Getti
Children used to grow on lilies, now they roll up Phillies
But the Pyramids of Cheops is my weed spot
Sometimes I eavesdrop in the books of Enoch
We went from studying epistles of Paul
Beneath a waterfall, rubbing crystal balls
But now we spray paint initials on the wall
On the wall, spray paint initials on the wall

From Then Till Now
What goes up must come down
What goes down comes back around again
Where it all began, began, began, began
From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now

Blessed Are Those,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"No monument will mark my resting place. I will leave only this, the story of my life. I have lived fully and deeply. I have tasted passion, crime and even murder. It is for you to judge me. You must weigh the good against the evil, the passion against the tenderness, the crime against the charity, the pleasure against the pain

It goes: life, difficult times and mad crimes
Some pay the price, while others refine
Blessed are those who struggle, God loves you
And Wisdom is the principle thing for Kings and Queens
(repeat 2X)

Many of lives will end, it's like a sad song from a violin
Trapped like Daniel's in the Lion's Den
Tryna pierce the iron skin of Leviathan
Souls blowing in the violent winds
God help us, if we die in sin
I hear the trials in the cries of men, that's when the riot begins
Like things never get better, we forever
Serving Nebuchadnezzar since the days of our ancestors
Slaves to a mad pleasure, building great architectures
Sharp dressers, smart professors
Start my lecture, I build lyrics like an art director
Show it to you like the film projector
Blessed Are Those who struggle, from day to day we all hustle
Coming home with sore muscles, scarred faces
Scuffed knuckles, we all share the same trouble
Separated couples, sometimes it seem like
There's no escaping, the clutches of Satan
Spending years in state pens, awaiting patient
Dreams of a scholarship, ended by a hollowtip
Politics and number slips

Verse Two: Killah Priest
Once shoved in ships, now we Bloods and Crips
Thugs with clips, niggas who love their cliques
Hit the clubs and shit so they can rub their hips
Hugs and flicks, niggas with drugs and whips
Cash Rules this Rotten Apple, they got a worm in it
Corrupt sinners, in my man's Jeep
With the windows tinted, sipping Guinness
Observing all the clinics and liquor spots
They make me lick a shot through the rooftop
I never seen the glory, in the ghetto it's the same story
Cigarette butts and cold coffee
Black faces and white mouths
They cry out, for the White House
Ain't no wealth shared, it's welfare
And poor health care, self scared
It's senseless, the way they got our black princess
On public assistance to end our existence

It's a blessing... to struggle
It's a blessing...
(repeat 2X)
Yeahhyeahhh, it's a blessing, just a blessing
It's a blessing... *fades*",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-blessed-are-those-lyrics
The Winged People, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Do you really know? Or were you taught what you know?
Do you believe or do you know?
Is your faith blind?
Or is it bright as the Sun?

They were here before Adam, descendants of Anu
Took on mortal fashion, built themselves statues
In the image of themselves to worship themselves
Built towers to themselves to remind them of when they fell
They came from a station in space, an angelical race
Giant in stature, helmets and capes
That they wore, visiting this planet to explore
Long journey from their own because their race had war
It's said they called their planet Nibiru and that they were fallen heroes
They saw gold, saw trees and life more liberal
Astronauts with afros and locks
Jet beaming into a ziggurat, they crashed on rocks
1.21 gigawatt, some passed over crops
In the tablets of legend, they said they opened the floodgates of heaven
Describing ten monstrous brethren
Chopping up their grandparents into seven pieces
Now they're looking for a region, they traveled eastern
Found a garden called Eden, they saw a being
Forced to bow before Ba'al or be exiled with the tribe of reptiles
Now called the Rothschilds and X-Files
Life begins breathing hydrogen inside of high winds
Milky Way violins heard by the wise men, observed in Orion
The windows with no end, the black glass in the sea that extends
Within that sea exists carbohydrates, these gods were hybrids
That went back and forth 'till they mixed with star bread
In the foods of thought with proteins
Protons and Adams produced the whole gene
To infinity to density to matter to atom to cells to organisms
To metamorphism to waters of the living to bodies back to godly",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-winged-people-lyrics
Tai Chi,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"The Sunz of Mansion has been opened up
The door is open, yeah, yeah

It's 9-, beware of biochips
Our shit hits harder than slave whips like I waited to give tips
From Egypts to seaships to being chased by New York
Cops out the precincts and words was bricks
We building projects to pyramids, evil kid
I destroy your ass like London Bridge, smoke trees of weed
Take off the leaves out the twigs, pure truth is what I got to give
A lot to live for, you ain't rich before poor
It ain't peace without war, how would stand without a floor
Under, over, toxicated, sober, younger, older
You're elevated higher than a Empire State
Elevators I roll with creators and cremators
Stalking through this nature, the Heaven Razah
Capacity in your brains beyond the clouds of rain
Seven and a half are contained
Space was my birthplace, meditate in cocoons
Now see snakes in human costumes

Expand your mind (Expand your mind) (4X)
In time... in time...

Call this the blind man talk, cripple man walk
See nor hear nor summon Sasquatch
It's evident per segment that unseen beings
Speak no evil, the all eye seeing
Tapping into the worlds vision with the proper rhythmic meditation
Situation on lives from state to state
Rent to pay, state debate, contract dates
Cheddar in error, slave mental death to the treasure
Washing my robe in the blood of the lamb, constant plan
Never strayin New York cause I rock supreme on the block and never
Black bring on the axe spring the ghetto compact
Put em on tracks, and let's see how they act as the aftermath
Increase accelerate the Sun you had no radia-tion, to burn to ashes
Ain't one of the parties you been crashing
Bring the beat and I'mma slash it
My niggas make sure the doors have been barricaded
It's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ?block spin?
But make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts
Redrum mania reincarnate to another shape
Bomb flashes, what can happen, New Jack-in
Your rappin ain't the Magnum so when he cought up to half these
Niggas even stole the soul of the streets in motion

(Expand your mind)
Expand your mind (Expand your mind)
Seek and you shall find

Walkin through the pineal glands, like it was a unforeign land
Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway
Through a long dark hallway
Use your conscious as a compass to avoid being conquered
By nonsense, use your subconscious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
And leave bread tracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
You might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understanding is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatric could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
Cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
Which is always competitive; therefore
You must never let it live

Expand your mind (Expand your mind)
Seek and you shall find",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-tai-chi-lyrics
Cross My Heart,Heavy Mental,1998,"(One two, one two)
No doubt
(The microphone's on)
Cross my heart, hope to die, word is bond
(I've been waiting along time for this)
Here we go, Killah Priest, '97, '98
Y'all know somethin'?

It's the Byzantine king, supreme
All kneel kiss the ring
 
into a Elohim
I blow steam from the families of the Maccabees
Smack emcees, watch 'em scream, ""Your Majesty!""
Make 'em suffer
 the capacity of tragedy
Hold the crowd down like gravity
Back the fuck off, stop grabbin' me, hands off me
Niggas start to bore me, I'm gettin' sleepy, I need some coffee
Me and my Wu-bandits, we bury niggas deep in the canvas
Body bandage like some mummies
You fucking dummies, you can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited, the most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out, ""Killah Priest!""
I leave the blood spilling in the streets
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville
The seven shields on windmills across the killin' fields
Never forget it, tell them rap critics
I speak in arithmetics, so they can never get it
I'm too scientific, lyrics explicit
I roll with thirsty niggas, thieves and killers
Tigers, gorillas, faces like Godzilla
We stomp rappers that smile like a car dealer
The God iller, cross my heart hope to die
We multiply, by the hundreds, drunken by the thousand
See me outside your show browsin', beating up your soundmen
Player haters and players, we give 'em cold stares
Any last prayers?

Concrete techniques, bomb beats that cause casualties
My faculty, hold it down like gravity
Rapidly 
threaten like weapons to adolescents
Ghetto residents
 
quick to past tense your present
State of the slums, kill for a plate of crumbs
Fake ones, they're coarse with smiles and snake tongues
I'm deep into this,I sometimes gasp for air
Deadly warfare, hot blocks, cops, and cold stares
Shots blare like fireworks on July the 4th
Weapons get tossed, fugitive slidin' off
My forces combine, new world, 2009
Digital criminals, we make mills in cybercrime
It's all planned ahead 2 times, 
I see the signs through a great mind
The heaviest chains could not bind

We stare you eye to eye, we tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die

High ranked officials in armed tanks with missiles
Blood drizzle, simple fact, you slept on the issue
That before you started jerkin' off Joysticks and Sega
I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
True fine tune it, ship enough units
MCs ask, ""Who be those rhyme killers in masks?""
No doubt, difficult task to last in the square
Beware, infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious with no opponents and blast through components
With microphonics, watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti that came approachin' this
Our incapable love speech remains motionless

We stare you eye to eye, we tell the truth no lie

Atoms to Adam,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, wow, wow
I see chariots in the skies
Men and Earth looked surprised as they flow across the sky
And I see the light deep into the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land
Swift as light, we took our flight, the chosen people
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, Lord, Lord
The reasons why we here
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, woah, woah
The reasons why we here

Before being born without physical form, a void in the vast
My space voyage begins between the asteroid
Before I landed upon the planet, it looked abandoned
Lost and stranded
I became a force that demanded life laws took flight
One course of the night, searched for any source of life
Light was the know the ledge coming from the edge of the Universe
Went past the Moon to the Earth, then from the womb to the nurse
With a slight remembrance how I came from a distance
To an instant existence with 5 senses
The quest for man repentance
While others cried, I exercised my third eye by hearing a lullaby
Then I magnified inside and became intelligent and wise
Transformed from the celestial
Shot through a sexual terrestrial's testicle vessel
Small as a decimal where I nestle
Nine months later, special delivery, the Killah P-R-I-E-S-T
From the fetus to the cleavage, from atoms to Adams
From atoms to Adams, from atoms to Adams

I see chariots in the skies
Men and Earth look surprised as they flow across the sky
And they see the light deep between the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land

So I begin between the meteorite, now I walk like Christ
Except I'm not sacrificed by the righteous parasite
Searching for paradise which is the birthright
Of a celestial Nazarite with appetites to bite from the Tree of Life
To smite Edomites, Sodomite, Moabites in the land of Canaanites
Following 6 flaming lights burning over 1 million degrees Fahrenheit
Bright as neon beyond the satellites
The flight takes me over cattle stocks
Blocks of ice, I began to flock, flock, flocked
Flocked across Mecca with a vivid projector
Seeking my accepter, looking at Rebecca
Two sons bopping through Jerusalem like the hoodlum, aahh
Principalities enables me to see the other galaxies
Releasing all calories by 8 author biters and allergies
I'm the author and the writer of a biography with God prophecies and challenge Egyptology philosophies and Greek mythologies
Going through the glossaries of Socrates
With Pharisees and Sadducees
Going through geology with degrees
 
I contact the Hasmonean dynasty
Approximately 168 BC
Transform from the Wu Killa Bee into the families of the Maccabee
I can see every species in 3D and hear them clear as CDs
During my pilgrimage, I walked through the wilderness
I had the privilege to see the pyramids
Which gave me the will to live
To roam through the villages and heal the kids
Walk across a bridge strong as Farrakhan
As a voice echo like Sarah Vaughan across the great Amazon
Stretching out my hand like Yon till it reach Babylon
Behold the physic phenomenon, quiet storm
I wander out on horizon from the top of holy mount Zion
Holding a staff and turned into a python
Killah Priest a living icon
Sitting in the form of a pentagon in the center of the octagon
Walking from Tyre to Sidon to Lebanon to the walls of Hong Kong
Recite the 23rd Psalm, long gone before the crack of dawn
Dodging and weaving through the Garden of Eden without eating
Speeding, throbbing, lobbing, evolving all the regions

As they flow across the sky

Those that were uncivilized was chastised
While the civilized were baptised
Twelve Tribes began to rise like bees from the hive
Causing seeds with their wives
Starting apartheid as scribes carried the archives
Follow the star guide as we glide through the windows of the far side
Across the dark sky, then over the ocean tides
The unidentified flying object hovers the projects
Scenery, Gothic sky can pass for darkness
As the thugs transform into prophets, the body becomes cosmic
As the floor becomes carpet they rise from out the toxic
And the wasteland and the garbage
Where faces of various shades of chocolate
Dropping their narcotics and the pork sausage
No longer Hell's hostage
From atoms to Adams..
(as they flow across the sky..)
From atoms to Adams..
(as they flow across the sky..)
From atoms to Adams..
(ever see the light, deep into the night
Of daily mars among the stars
In that distant land...)",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-atoms-to-adam-lyrics
New Reality, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"Its true! It’s a tiny little planet
I leave it sometimes and travel all over the universe
I go to other galaxies and visit strange alien planets
I zoom right through things like meteor showers
And skim over black holes
It’s exciting

Children of the lower worlds less fortunate
From the orphanage, tear drops, coffin lids
The upper world feels your pain
120.000 years of rain for the young and the slain
Your memory last for centuries
A tribute for what you been through, may your life continue
Live on on other planets where you see the great ones standing
Even though they took life for granted
It’s like the untold stories of 
Kelvin Martin
Investigation found the macs and volts in his apartment
The informant, mob cops, crime bosses
And cover ups, FBIs and flying saucers
Watching night watch, online love affairs and true crimes
Congregation of Masons showing new signs
Government conspiracies
The X9 hollow in the hands of this Killa Bee
Jericho flesh build walls around my mind from a speck of dust
To my exodus to the black holes to the nebulas
I hear mystic messengers in raindrops
Crack the code of the crop, my brain locks
Then slide out the chamber
Ink sprays all over the paper, the diary books of a gangster

Welcome you to the New Reality
I welcome you to the New Reality

No more prosecutors’ excitement remarkable federal indictments
Million dollar drug bust while thugs discuss
Mathematical enlightenment with masterful writing
Mind travel need no license, just high science
And incredible rhyming what happened to Tyson?
They killed his mind, he stopped fighting
Early eighties the man was a giant
A nightclub owner secret friends with two Columbian drug lords
They all traffickers, 
Saint Valentine’s Day blood massacre
The heart in my chest is the shape of Africa
My brain is lavender
Accepting calls from 9/11 plane passengers
They say they never aboard the government used remote
So let’s revolt, someone cut the cord, at night the sky ignite
What’s that falling fiery rings I am king
From higher heights I sit beyond the neon cloud
For aeon my name rings out loud the future is now
Eternal life is in the journals I write
Exit, I exist as one, there is none besides the Son
Beyond boundaries without change of movement
Only elements and ruins concealed within myself
Thoughts of a seahorse submerge deep in the cosmic water
I breathe the source of life then force planets
Small to gigantic, gave them commandments
The wings of the wind, fly by flapping across the entire atlas

Profits of Man,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"Even Kings die, thrones rust, skeleton bones turn to dust
Memories are blown in the gust
It's about how you live when you were here
How you celebrated those years
Were you a follower? Did you try elevating your peers?
Were you sincere when you gave the prophets your ears?
Or soon as trouble come you disappear
Listen here were you real?
Did you show love that people could feel?
Did you have jealousy but keep it concealed?
Did you smile at your man's face?
But all awhile wanted to take your man's place
Moving around like a snake
I know you hate that term, don't call it that
Seen lately that's why the Priest been falling back
Cause when the Revolution start
All those cliques that fall apart will soon be the Devil's mark
And none the adversary will have a heart
The letter from Priest, my freedom of speech
Y'all read 'em and weep
The demons that keep you from the path just laugh
That's my ink pad looks like Stained Glass
A collage of art, that show scenes from the Nazarene's past

From my connections with 60 Second
The Art of War to in the city, signed to Geffen
For 5% lessons, Israelite tribal dressing
Disciple Armageddons
, 
that Bible record
To 
Sunz of Man
 
to damn near becoming one of the Clan
Members I remember, in Brooklyn
, 
GZA and Masta Killa
To my last chapters with the RZA
Testimony stops, 
Ol' Dirty got knocked
Came home and signed with the ROC
Cocaine combined with rocks
Rick James style, his nickname ""Wild; Old Dirt Dog""
It hurt us all when his hearse disappeared in the fog
I stayed digital, never analog, original
Always camouflaged, turn them cameras off
Light those candles God, I'm the example
Like I'm speaking from panels y'all
The soul inside of me is fiery, society lied to me
They said,""You gotta die to be free""
My diaries of anxiety frightens me
Light will squeeze through my crack buildings where my writing be
Striking my page with hyphens and brighten my T's
To my seeds, the uncivilized time has come
Y'all better run, the time has begun

Yo, from total strangers to best friends
To best friends to brothers
From brothers to never calling him again
Their coffins descend, one flies to a place of peace
The other Lake of Fire, devils hauling you in
As one began, one ends, the Earth still spin
We're hurt, tears in our shirt, spirit must transcend
What you think sleep is for? A deeper cause
Preparing us for the other side till the Reaper calls
Either or, we're breathing for try a reason
Arrived rich but we're leaving poor
Stand naked when you see the Lord
I stand protected when I see his war, till I exit and I'm free to soar
I'm embraced by space, though it's cloudy around me
Its light weighs from a tree till they wither the brown leaves
Bounty's of blessings 
from my heavy mind
To every rhyme I said, looking from Masada
From the Church of Priest
, 
the dark August
Till he showed you the art on his Offering
Oops, I call it the gift, Behind the Stained Glass
It's a frame of my pad, I started this
Release the toxins, breathe out the oxygen
Now see how shocking you fools if you think the Saint will lose
I say things that'll make the picture in the paintings move
Now after this ink this jewel, look!

What profits that man?
Who would gain the whole world yet lose his soul
What profits that man?
Somebody tell me
What profits that man?
Somebody tells me
What profits that man?
Who would fear his enemy and think he didn't exist
What profits that man?
Somebody tell me
What profits that man?
Somebody tell me
Somebody tell me
If you can
What profits that man?
Who would gain the whole world but lose his soul
What profits that man?
What profits that man?
What profits that man?
The way good and evil could never balance equal
And no man, for no man could be both good and evil
From strings that are attached to each other
And that string tilt to one way or the other
Even into one grain that'll strip us
If you've done evil, then I guess you're missing it
It'll be the over-taker, the architecture
What I could build will kill",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-profits-of-man-lyrics
Come With Me,Priesthood,2001,"As I lay upon my bed, I stare at the ceiling
The feeling inside me is dead, what's that voice I'm hearing
So I reach for the spread, pull it back, saw demons
Making my wife give 'em head, I wake up screaming
What is the meaning, am I dead?, Am I still dreaming?
Will I wrestle with this devil whenever I'm sleeping
Wake up behind the metal of a federal precinct
Or be found in the ghetto taking several of beatings?
From policemen, will I die for what I believe in?
Will I ride until I'm no longer breathing?
I need to know until my soul is leaving through that hole, I see Him
Up that road to meet Him and behold His kingdom
And I stand before His judgement, my body a ghost
I'm seeing dozens of my cousins, distant and close
Whether relatives or friends, I remember them both
Then I walk, what's that? my end, then a voice had spoke
It said..

Come with me, I'll take you there
Come with me, have no fear

All I saw was fire and smoke and bodies that roast up
Young adults that were under a cloke
And took a number of oaths 'til they hung from a rope
I said damn, I saw my man pull a gun from his coat
Ran up before the preacher popped one in his throat
I ain't scared because the chair share hundreds of volts
And I know this is not the place that he wanted to go
I want to leave because this place here is punishing folks
So I fell on both knees, face pouring with sweat
When an angel approached me, placed a sword on my neck
I cried with every bit of pride all on my breath
There I was strapped to a bed having war on my flesh
The priest threw holy water on me, called me possessed
Doctors held me down but I tore through my vest
Psychiatrists came, read the results of my test
I threw up over the nurses, left the floor in a mess
Come with me! Come with me
Chorus x2

I dreamed of harm and blood, rusty chainsaws, bodies in tubs
That painted walls, saw armys of thugs
Saw men made zombies from drugs
Enemies from centuries fill my body with slugs
There I was in paradise, the marriage of Christ
I saw nazarites, all gathered in white
Written down in the tablets of life
What it means while the church at the Vatican fight?
There were flames, I passed through a traveling light, I was changed
Became a phantom of the night, the upper plain
No longer suffer the same, had enough of the pain
Felt a rush in my vein, words stuck in my brain
Had nothing to gain, everything to loose
Which cliques of the game do I claim to choose?
Saw every ancient tomb and the saints in bloom
Heard the sounds of the trumpets as the angels blew
Come with me!
Chorus x4",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-come-with-me-lyrics
Brilliantaire, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"An Alternative Myth:
If, there is any such thing at all as intelligence
And love, and beauty, well, you found it in other people

Sitting in my chair, then the vision appears
Staring at the wall, the wall turned into the spheres
And the spheres held the planets
Some were distant, some near
Outer limits, I in a instant was there
Warm currents were rushing, infinities came in abundance
Centuries seasons Zodiac by the dozens
Prophesying thy coming, and it was told
I hold the mic way beyond the hundreds
The mic turned to greatness
Greatness took me to the sacred places to give
Threw glory over me like a blanket
Then I reclined so I can see the design
Voice said close your eyes, cuz all we need is your mind
And the rhyme like a storm as the currents blew me on
Through gasses, I saw places where planets were born
And the voice that spoke to my ghost majestic
Let's show you the essence
Let's reveal to you the presence
The Seventh Seal of the heavens
Within the will of the legend
The seal of the lessons
The skill is perfection
Knights kneel before the weapon
Alchemist of the sinister
To heal within the message
To build effervescent
I feel shadows all around me
They said they're just the pharaohs tryna crown me
There's tarots of crystal balls within your boundaries
You're now free to explore
All the visions encountings your mind can soar
For all the wisdom and counseling
A psychic mystique; I've been writing for weeks
Every time I say a rhyme it whitens my teeth
Make angels pillars of stone - people pillars of salt
What I reveal under the cloth, when Killah would talk
Swimming in the cosmic gulf, and the rivers of thought
Where the healers was taught
But in the mirrors seem lost
And they finished the planet Tiamat on the Shabbat
Then they planted Eden crops when the evening would drop
When there was nothingness
That's when Yah made the covenant
On the cross' blood would drip and the corpse buzzards pick
Time and admiration, stress and aggravation
I don't do yoga but I can stretch your imagination
God tears turns into prayer beads
Falls over the neck of Cardinal wearing the wooden Mary
Whisper verses over the buried, in the Celtic cemetery
And he held it till his visions were heavy
Like a time machine saw the dynasty of kings
Through the mind it was seen, the skyline turned to wings
We wear paint beads, water or oil
Saint holy men, beggar or royal
Angels, devils, or aliens, which do you believe in more?
Do you receive or restore?
Do you want peace or war?
Do you wish to live free or by law?
It gets deep to the core
We perform prayers faster than charities
Go on pilgrimage but do we know what real healing is?
Research a million in years, the real healing is here
Without the billion, I became a billionaire
From natural disaster, till the days of dinosaurs, the raptors
To common laws, to all kinds of war, till the rapture",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-brilliantaire-lyrics

Landed on a sick canvas
Now I roam this dead planet, head bandaged
Insane, preachin God's commandment, feel me

I move through the dark regions, and won't stop
'til we even, until you bleedin, until you stop breathin
Givin careers a severe beatin for emceeing
It's something that I don't take lightly
How the fuck you ever invite me to a duel?
I drool before I break fool, then I drag MC's
Beat em down to they knees, grab your necks and squeeze
Till there's no life left, they lifeless
Then micless, what a crisis
I give them a good night's rest
I break they biceps, and triceps, thighs and necks
Breast area is the best area
Before I bury ya, I make sure that you never ever, ever, ever try that shit no more
KnowhatI'msayin? (Word is bond!)
Your ambition put you in that fucked up condition
Leave you with your own conviction, shit was not fiction
Now you in a state of non-fiction
Make you beg for mercy if you ever approach me
I blow your head off when I talk, chop off your arms
And bash your head in, you know where this shit is headin
For a dead-end, stop your sweatin
Like Otis Reading, got your pants wettin
Snuck up on you at your wedding, at your honeymoon
Turn that shit into doom
Turn your rap cassettes into your fucking caskets
You God damn bastards
Lyrics I mastered, rhymes burns like acid

I'm complete analyzer of your entire eye
Gave you no time to crawl, so walk on by
I'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie
The good to your bye; your question to your why?
The wing to your fly, low to your high
The Dirt Dog, I be the God; the tear to your cry
I drop in it, cleanse the Earth's
My place to birth strong, gave me the eye

The fatal brave to grave, the ceremonies from religious cults half man and half goat
Tomorrow hopes, based on the horoscopes
We followed goats, our nose and hella smoke
Fire breathin dragons, I rubbed the gold lantern
To the see the future through the crystal ball
The triple walls of fisher wants to miss the fall
Offense see the coffin often
I fell at the doorstop coughin, I heard the pipe organ (cough)
Saw some men of a white origin
I saw Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and George Bush
Barefoot, sucking from the titties of a wolf
Upon the brazen altar
Six men offer their only daughter splashing holy water
I ran for the, camcorders, now I'm plagued with curses
I roam the Earth's surface, snatchin purses
Allergic to catholic churches, what's the purpose
Religious worship, is worthless
I visit ancient sanctuaries, where the saints were married
But now they buried cause of Satan's fury, I faced the jury
Held in court like Christ nailed to a cross
Confront my knowledge like Christ in front of Pontius Pilate
Days of violent, standing in a haunted palace
The government wants my wallet
 (x2)
I'm complete analyzer of your entire eye
Gave you no time to crawl, so walk on by
I'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie
The good to your bye; your question to your why?

There comes a time without no money, drugs and guns
Just the Mind as a Weapon for the blind, deaf and dumb

Here we come, here we come, use the truth to overcome
Here we come, here we come, here we come
After my dagger enters, blood drips from ya liver
I set up real world niggas out like I'm Tommy Hilfiger
Take the motive vibe, eye of a killer
Place drugs and arms on drug dealers
Satan says ""Satan get behind me""
Georgio Armani, custom garments made from Godbody
I said the truth hurts ya weak spot like karate
Illuminati/FBI's couldn't watch me
You won't survive with a Versace
Or when the gunshot hit ya body
I'm on some next shit, it's a war, get out ya Lexus
You on my guest list, so choose ya exit
To ya deathwish, the useless get buried my a homocidal of unnecessary
We be drinkin' royal wine, pumpin' wine berries
I never drink the blood of Mary, ya ass don't scare me
The enemy is my worst enemy
Virus to this music industry, come and deliver
Ya water, ya penalty, niggas they be killin' me
Like they mobsters from Italy
Meanwhile Kings hate Queens in captivity
Al Capone clones and brains in slave chains
Check the herobome, transportin' through white robes
Headphones and telephones, to make the unknown known
Before sticks and stones broke bones
We was conquerin', Roman gold robes
Kidnapped, naked away from home, now we red guest rolls
Called by Jon Doe now with the Red Rose, the communists
Snakes transform like Optimus Prime to a suit and tie
My mind detects like a lie detector
We don't need Gadgets to be Inspectors
The only knowledge, got on Mecca reflectors
Ain't nothin' funny, I burn ya rap clothes and ya money
There's too many crash test dummies
Wearin' shades cuz the truth gets too sunny
Me and my true fam', we spread history like a museum
Put ya guns down and use ya two hands
Keepin' documents stack like the paper at a newstand
The old man ordered the Mr. Officer to stop the lock up
The black orchestra, scuba divers in Nautica drownin'
In the blood, road warriors don't budge
I offer the same office of death of a life of a slave
Bright light keep the bats in the caves
Some sold their soul to the Devil to get paid in bundles
Betray sense, back to the grave in the jungle
And the camouflage nation never change, now they're humble
Makes the world rumble
They shock the world from all, skyscrapers crumble
And the running back fumbles


Killah Priest
We used to wear Cuffies studded with Rubies
But now we into Gucci, Tommy Gunns and mob movies
Kids ya get robbed for ya lucci
My black woman, so many names, something
Their whole wind, sting
For ya mind and I'll be the string
Use a form of Yoga, turn my mic into a King Cobra
Pull out ya brain Nova, my album'll touch you like the death of Malcolm
Stalk prey like a falcon
When I design poems, each line shines like a rhinestone
Will leave ya mind blown, lost in a timezone
Politicians follow traditions, they got Clinton spittin'
Some are supersticious, a group of witches
Reduced to bitches, everyday they shoot switches
I'm on the loose takin' pictures
At all the Devils, I drop science like metal
Black as Othello, heat up a mic like a kettle
The kid says, ""Settle down.. down.. down""
I'm supernatural, factual, actual, the master
My garment is laced in Jasper
Jade, amber, the ladies pull out their cameras
At the 7 Shield Commander
Salute the troops when I was away to recoup'
As a juvenile is when I had to prove style
Was too cock', it made him shake in his boots
Must choose spot between Gates and Truth
And got with the boys and did biz and got lig
Re-nig and made noise like toys and kids
Words around the block, the cops versus us
And got my Glock cocked now I'm ready to bust
Aimin' at Jack with two gats, who to shoot at
They moved back.. but hold up before we do that
Let's do a rally in the alley
And niggas that'll rally in the valley, ready to retali-
Ate, why realize the hate from the trials and their dates
Doin' miles, so they foul from the state
Or do abort their health and aborted all their self
I hold my ammunition cuz I take the sword of delf
Vicious, whoever seem suspicious, hit him, leave him twisted
Just lost my job and got evicted
Thugs and drug dealers gettin' slugs and squealers
They hug the killers and drink mugs of Miller's
And have ya vexed in a hold up while the cops eatin' donuts
Families is broke up, families is broke up
Families is broke up
Broke up.. broke up, what?

Ein Sof (Paradise), The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2012.0,"This cigar's good
I’m gonna tell a story
Yeah, that's what we’ll do

At night the lepers break into the temple
And drink the sacrificial vessel dry, a condor into the sky
Cigar smoke reverse in front of my eyes
Back into my mouth, the fire goes out
My room turns black, the Moon gets fat
Beneath it there are secrets, dealers with crack
Killers with gats, hoodies and cap, I’m out of body
I become the streets breathing through the sewer hole
I am the belt that shooters hold
I became the building that’s chilling, Murals, R.I.P
Across my brick stomach, someone’s coming
Barely could hear what their lips are mumbling
They stash a bag between my bones
Suddenly, I am the bag, holding three crystal stones
The crack inside me yelling they can’t breathe
I tried to use my cemented abdomen to push them free
They told me if they find their supplier, he usually finds a buyer
Then it’s off to the Lighter, the tube of Fire
They said then we become as One
We transform into something strong, a gas, toxic form
From solid to killing brain cells
It’s insane in this hell, so please free us
Fall upon us, crush us to Dust
Just then two fingers grabbed him, one wore a ring
I became a sleeve, the wrist spoke to me
He said his hand's about to freeze
Heard a conservation between a ring, told a story of a finger
Who pushed the trigger for them little killers, we call them rocks
His hand got hot, I became as hard as liver
Yell, ""Stop!"", he's riddled from shots
His turned dark, I woke up and lit up a bark

Glory, money, judgement, fame
Demons, temple, alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise
The Glory, the money, the judgement, the fame
The Demons, the temple, the alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise

When I sleep I dream of deers, a black forest. rivers of blood
Pentagrams on the mirrors of thugs
Scary mares of my enemies filling me with slugs
Haunting my memories, it’s the misery I love
I wake up with prayers under my breath
Make sure the stairs is under my steps
Lately I’ve been writing pages under distress
I want to see the new life that’s promised
I want to see the men who lived honest
I want to see the things of Nostradamus, Prophet Muhammad
I look around; all I see is garbage
Kid searching through a dead man’s pockets
The projects, we try to survive
Why we only ask questions when we high?
I want to see the Messiah's enthronement
I want to see the peace and light on the night of atonement
I want to see Heaven on Earth, the afterlife the rebirth
The Nazarite bring Peace to our turf
I know the Devil want it all reversed
It’s all up in the Universe, but you have to some research
If you a leader of your crew, they wanna kill you
You see higher than your team, they wanna shill you
If you talk about the problems in your hood, they wanna replace you
If you try to do good, they gonna hate you
With this mindstate, what do you do?
What path do you choose? Either way you have to pay dues
They say we all born to lose, we're set up to fail
I’m on my roof top, ""Victory!"" I yell
Like Obama did it with the girls and Michelle
I look at this government and load up my shells

Glory, money, judgement, fame
Demons, temple, alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise
The Glory, the money, the judgement, the fame
The Demons, the temple, the alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise

A story of a man, who told a story of another man
Who told a story of another man

Quantum Spirit of Creation,Planet of the Gods,2015,"My millennium years is in the hundreds
The abundance of the Earth's circumference
More verses under the summits, reverse the compass
Bursting of thunders, let it rain from the brain there's a storm
Each unit is drawn like a cuneiform, grow wings like the unicorn
I sit down writing rhymes from noon to dawn till the moon is gone
As I remain in solitude, I do the impossible
I can move a molecule like a marble move
The hollow the cube dissolving into two
The rhyme revolved and turned them back into fuel
Thought of mind and it turn into food
I drop a jewel that's too heavy
Bars is over his head, he's getting sweaty
Can't pick up the line he ain't ready
Steady doing push up with you pushing your luck
Pressed for time then I wait, this gem is for the class of the great
The star elder, the cosmic heart astrology chart
Mars dweller, body becomes cellular
Encoded with DNA of poets, sky gapes
Guided to the cosmic on a landscape, my phantom escape
Saw myself standing in a round structure, dome shape
I heard the gods Ausar, Abzu, and Heru
Somewhere near a pyramid in Peru
The Adonai, Most High, I and I
, Elohim, King of Kings
The Nommos from the cosmos, serpents for the logo
The first Sapiens were the hobos
Quetzalcoatl from the star Sirius B
Gods from the period B.C
Perfect like the pendulum through energy continuums
Half brain reptilian called the Anunnakis'
Landed in the safari of Mali saw the Dogon tribes
They had scaly skin, proton eyes, floated on in the skies
Nibiru, Vishnu, Neteru, the disc move from the sphere cube
The Earth was void and formless, empty without voyage
Weight and density they formed their assembly
Darkness was upon the face of the deep
With their conscience they found the space to create heat
So they moved upon the face of the waters to create in these quarters
Moving through space in these saucers to show and prove
It got so hot it evaporated then made it cool with their aura
Then one spoke, ""Let there be light!""
Then they took the ray and called it day and the shade they called night
Within their specs they formed the gas clouds
Of energy, mass perfect and round
With widths, depths, and pounds a system of planets, inorganic and organic
Amino acids, chemical catalysts,  catalysts becomes enzymes in time became cells
That fell until oceans, became whales (wells?)
Creature with fins, then skin and shells
So they started high above us, the sky structures
Then they made pigment and eye colours
Their glory transmitted to man image through chromosomes
Divide the combined clusters divine wonders
Multiplied in wide numbers, knowledge, singular
That's one from plenty gods
In their glory they spun us the Sun, a duality
Two wisdom when in their glory again created a system
New reality, a school of alchemy
They formed the trio, understanding
Meaning under the heavens is standing above your ego
And culture was the tetra-geometric of four
Freedom gave them the power to add one more
5 that's a pentagon
This gave man the idea to draw the shape of stars
Equality, the subtublet the blueprint of God
The 7 sides of the heptagon
They wrote their names in the book of life, the angelic lexicon
Complex they begin to build a octogon
That's eight and every nine thousand years is born in space
And reformed and reshaped
God's spirit inside a hydrogen case
That let us create, body then face at perfect temperatures
At 37 Celsius
And give them trees for vegetables and cereals for healthiness
Have you not heard, have you not seen dimethyltriptamine to the mausoleum
Back to the gods, back to the star beams
Origin, their cells fell and the ocean became whales (wells?)
Organisms and the time before, then the dinosaur",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-quantum-spirit-of-creation-lyrics
Color of Ideas,Planet of the Gods,2015.0,"Ancient worlds with airplanes
, scientists can’t explain
Shadow pharaohs travel aboard portal trains
Through wormholes abode, without burning coal
At dusk priceless busts like Tut and sit on gold
Before the lord raindrops hit the globe to wash away the giants of old
Before Adam lying in the garden with his ribs exposed
Reconstruction of the cosmos, the worlds that God rose

The imagination has a bridge to fascination to which we live
In Genesis take a pilgrimage to the wilderness
Stop searching for the wiz
What you need? Courage, heart or a brain?
Rediscover each part, I'll explain
The tin man is the working man, he had no heart for retire plans
The scarecrow was the Farmers
Y'all know they say southern people had no brains
Without them we get no vegetables or grains
Zion was the lion, had no courage
Dorothy and the dog now is now uncovered

The origins of the kabbalah
The Moors bend before Allah
The articles of the merkabah
God moves in the aggadah
Black Jews salute, Yahawah
Yahweh, Yahuwah
My medulla go through futures
A pearl in the sky
A cloud in the shape of a shell in the land where Oysters die
I stood on the beach, I started to cry
Sand shot from eyes, I dive in the ocean to dry

Memoirs of of tomorrow, a ship lodged in a bottle
Societies beneath a sun inside a Earth that's hollow
Fuel burst from Apollo, a crew search for a marble
That can give each human the feeling like it hit the lotto
The sky fell by the head of a swallow
A thousand eagles lifted it off it's body
And back to the cosmos, book scrolls and novels
Subatomic clouds above a conscious crowd
That stand on radio actives sand
Hundreds of white garments bow
Beneath the moon is the barn owl
Land of the black alien wizards
Alpha Dracon star human seas, Luciferians and mystics
Priest the autoraptatrone, the megaspitacron
The grand mic holder, the HipHopgrapher niggergon
Melaninated wars, he elevated from floors
Back into the light holding a mic
Through metal spaceship doors that hover the lake fog

Play em back to back sit back enjoy the spheres",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-color-of-ideas-lyrics
Mystic City,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"I've found a star (What's deal god, I heard you got some)
I've found a star (Bad news about Killah Priest, ya know)
I've found a star (Out here, right now it's madness)
Where do we go from here (Things going on, word, shooting up)
After the storm is clear (Lot of cops, ya know what I'm saying)
Where do we go from here (It's madness that's going on in the)
After the storm is clear... (World today, so what I've gotta do is)
(Open up my mind, and then try to, ya)
(Know, take it from there, from what I)
(Can build, ya know what I'm saying?)
('Cause, ain't nobody gonna, nobody gonna)
(Look out for me...)
It's the end of the road, It's like the red moon over Tibet

Theory of the 12 Monkeys, left in this cold war hungry
We kill over blood money, the cops seem to think it's funny
We murder over pennies and crumbs
Plenty of guns, crammed in the city slums
The man pity none for this next millennium
Kids starving when they breath you can see they kidneys and lungs
They left blind, skinny and dumb
Sights far from a pretty one, praying to God, when will he come?
But half of my crew is atheists
While the other half's waiting on a spaceship, I can't take it
Screaming life is what you make it, so called fake-friends
They all snakes in the end, trying to hide they face
Try to blend one mistake, I see them grin
Try to say we of the same kin, because we have the same skin
I live amongst the unholy, we all role weed
Thick as Jamaican rollies until the lords scold me
And told me, you'll be my next Moses
Go sake the hopeless and the homeless
With eviction notice arrive like the infant Joseph
With a grudge to Caesar like the Blood of Jesus
I told the Judge they don't love us, we don't love 'em either
My sword would drink the blood of an unbeliever
My sword would drink the blood of an unbeliever
My sword would drink the blood of an unbeliever
My sword would drink the blood of an unbeliever

Where do we go from here (where do we go from here)
After the storm has cleared (after that storm has cleared)
Where do we go from here (like nights over Tibet)
After the storm has cleared...

My home is where the psycho rage
Spending long nights and cold days
Inside a bible cage
Is it the curse of a bible plague?
Welcome, to the cyber age
The air's burning like a microwave
The holy lands sees miles away
I pour out some Alizé
Beneath the skies cause the clouds are gray
Jackals pile the graves of the older slaves
Reptiles arise, from out the caves they invade
The dirt under my nails got a story to tell
I wrestle with angels like Michael L, spending nights in Jail
Beneath the Hell's dungeon, with the drunkards tongue kiss
We all haunted and unwanted
Forgotten city where the air stays hot and misty
I see crack fiends with rotten titties
Twist the top off a whisky, each block is risky
That's why my shots empty, till the cops come and get me
I stay in green camouflage, I see cameras on Mars
All ready to start, scanning our cards
World famine at large, they got us trapped like
Shadrach and Meshach, and Abednego
I'm looking for the city of gold, I pity the soul
They take humans and start branding them like food cans
It's like the six points of the hexagram
Resembles the sects of man, all my children in Bethlehem
I dropped the Tec out my hand
Dropped to the earth caressed the sand
Yes I understand now
I heard a voice say, ""Come hither""
I walk while others slither, lead me to my father's river
 
Where do we go from here.. 
After the storm has cleared.. 
Where do we go from here.. 
After the storm has cleared.. 
Where do we go, we go.. 
After the storm has cleared, the storm has cleared...
Where do we go, from here, where do we go
After the storm has cleared.. the storm has cleared
Where do we go, from here, from here 
After the storm has cleared.. 
Where do we go, away from here

Melodic Pt. 2,The Offering,2007,"Yo, yo, what up, son? Yeah
Get your weed and your Heineken
It's melodic, Yo, yo, who got a stogie on them?
Priest...I'm dropping the Killah
Beloved the beloved beloved brothers come on

When doves cry doobie fly Cooley High school kids
Watching White Shadow my favorite character was Coolidge
Movie slides the shots and the car chase
My favorite was Al Pacino in Scarface
Cool like DeNiro in Casino, old Mob tapes
It made my heart break when Fredo ratted on his brother Michael
Godfather 2, we replayed the Don's drama in school
Article 2, my 16's are like
Billion-dollar budget movie scene on big screens
Al Green is doing my themes
From off the Greatest Hits which is my favorite disc
Play it, it skips, the screens burns from a tiny brown hole
In the center the bulbs pop it's the picture
I learned to handle bars on the mic
Before I handled bars on the bike, I hold it tight
Drug dealers homage empty promises acknowledge this
Broken dreams smoking fiends lying on the roof
Some are nodding with the belts tied around they arms
Out cold, pipes still in they palms
A household about five at night four are gone
To roam the streets around Section 8
Here's my Offering pass around collection plates

Dreamers dream, melodic flow governed by Kings
Wings of a phoenix bird take up my words
And peck 'em down to a compound, observe
Refers his master

Stainless glass windows of ancient black Negroes on my casement
My visitors, thug niggas hopping out of spaceships
Like ""What up Priest? We just swerved across your spectrum""
Word, had Armani spacesuits, holding two bad alien birds
Saying ""Neek neek neek"" translated means ""where's the herb?""
He fucked the green bitch, I took the blue one
Up in some alien pussy
""Nigga, save the crew some!""
Yells one of my dogs
Just came home from Mars
He was up in this bar where this lizard bitch was stripping
Bugging, like we acid tripping
Addicts in my vision
The scene turns like it's Claudine
James Earl Jones, hot combs over stoves
Dax hair grease, a rare piece of footage, hood clips
Narrated and composed by the Priest
Curtains close on the streets
The score's done by the poor but the pure dreamers


Handwriting's on the project wall
Spray painted in the modern day Cuneiform
 on black uniforms
You might meet a crackhead that made it, to translate it
He can tell you who's fuckin' with broads, and who related
But you gotta know the ghetto password, so he could say it
In the Hood we turn throwing up signs into a language
Rather blue steel or stainless guns, we gonna buy 'em
Riots, we gonna start 'em, fuck it, they got problems
Pour me some more crushed grapes in my cup, it's envy and lust
It's automatic semis we clutch, to David Ruff
We carve knives out of elephant tusks
Eleven of us, then build about the angels and the God we trust",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-melodic-pt-2-lyrics

(""They spit like something else"")
Maccabee (as the books get close and we move on)
It isn't human
I'm get you nigga (or the other) this how we do it

I hide my face like the Elephant Man
Follow you, reach out of long black sleeves with skeleton hands
Touch rappers, watch them rot, their skin fall off
Boil in the pavement on a cold boardwalk
Then I laugh like the Joker while pissing on them
Then put on my hood wait on the next corner
The next victim look in his face with tears in my eyes
That crystallize and turn into stone before they fall from my dome
Like an avalanche, the way I spit sound like an African chant
The Priest run through MCs like I'm trampling ants
Peep the form, it's the Vatican stance
The Pope victor the first the flow spit with the curse
The sicker the verse the more bodies we stick in the dirt
Wait around I'ma pick you a hearse
I like the long black ones, drive around while spinning on two wheels
It's whatever you feel, blue steel
On black day, silver clouds when the mac spray
Turn rappers back into clay
My minds a museum filled with microphone exhibits
Of rhymes that I write that look like pictures

Aiyo my technique is berserk
I predator y'all niggas, pull your fucking skin off like a t-shirt
Retort, no remorse
Donate aborted rappers to stem cell research
I spit a few bars and niggas is FUBAR
You wouldn't ride on me if you was driving two cars
Homey, the mind of Cesar Augustus
Rocking a Caesar, eating a Caesar salad in August
Plus I'm illustrious, I've been with the Moors
Born and raised in L.A. by Monster Cody
Slowly chose the dark side for ice cold 40s
Like Obi-Wan Kenobi with an iced-out rollie
And might fuck a white bitch, don't get it fucked up
Love black chicks but they don't like to suck nuts
So tell me what the hell am I supposed to do
It's like sipping sizzurp in Houston, I'm supposed to screw
Talk slimy like okra, TiVo shit backwards
Just to make Harpo out of Oprah
Rass spits sicker than most groups put together
Cause y'all put together, I put fool to leather
And walk over dead bodies like Rise of the Machines
Don't be surprised nigga, it's Idi Amin
Rappers get ate up like the number on Kobe's jersey
Goddammit, I pop the clergy

Canibus, the only MC on Earth
That did geophysical research about the new rebirth
The Sun turn the Earth to rotisserie dirt
Listen before you start dissing me first, this will be worst
Twelve degree pole shift displace the ocean
They send space probes in, they come back broken
Armageddon omen, Planet X inbound and rapidly approaching
None of us are chosen
Field manual 2-0 dash 4-6
Your life's getting away, you better run for it
Population reduction, mass destruction
The reset button is coming and some of us love it
The return of Nibiru, we will prepare you
Stay away from the media, they will scare you
Rappers respect beef, tactics and technique
I'ma show you how the best compete, let's peep
My verse on the mic is surgical strike
Of herbal delight with no personal life
Live Saturday Night, sacrifice batter the mic
Jab to the left, jab to the right

I'm the scripture sculptor, volcanic
You ignoramus I'm the future
Volcanic vulture firebird
I fire words catch this cannon
All opponents poetry Leonus
Spartan you just can't sink me
Shots, Hell's Kitchen to Helsinki
Since I was born its all about Roman
Since the Roman wars I been Caesar
Master sieges, master of diseases
Throughout the Legions, temperatures beyond degrees
Terrifying like Saddam in legions
Ingenious fuck ya, I don't wanna have to bust ya open
But I think ya looking to closely
And I don't wanna have to bust ya eyes, fuck it, fuck ya eyes
Fuck ya mama, fuck the drama
Who needs it? Who like it? Who bleeds it?
Who think it? Who smoke it? Who drink it?
Motherfucker I'm a start shrinking
Each and everyone of you niggas, you just particles
You walk in and get read like articles
Shredding I'm a teach all y'all

Where you gonna hide? (Information)
When the truth comes down upon ya

Information, we have to come with the laser scanners
In supermarkets and department stores
And direct mail houses
Were to record every single items we purchase
Data about ya daily habits
And movements will flow into the beast system
From spy satellites, constantly circling overhead
Watching us like it’s sporting
6-6-6 database investigate
Entire race heading for a cyber-space
Riots breaks inside an Empire States
Every move you make is recorded on tape
Some of us are wired prisoned behind gates
Hidden miniature videos in a brief case

Recording our every activities: indoors, outdoors, day and night. Obscenely invaded our policy, our prophecies

Star gazin', cause Allah is far amazing
Than any graven god of a pagan
Raised in synagogues of Satan
Awakened with the scar of a nation
Left beats scarred an shaken
Robbed of education, my birth was foretold
From deep within my wardrobe, embrace the crossroad
We once wore gold, but now we electric probes
With silicon brains, synthetic
All faces are strange, pathetic, check the eyes
A man can’t even recognise his family
I blame it on humanity for this insanity
Spy satellites, the last battle for life
There’s no day or night, CIA
Take samples of my DNA
New borns, grow horns, placed in uniforms
Shipped off to the military
With they killed and buried

Interactive TV sets will be watching us, just as we watched them. They will also report back to the beast at computer headquarters. 
Our telephone conversations will be automatically wire tapped
 
and transcripted by the national security agency
Honesty, modesty
Poverty, famine, the sons of Amman
Deal with reprogramming, iris scanning

Breaking out of Satan’s bondage with long garments
Like we bionic, no longer paying homage
Remember after ‘9-6 we wear biochips
Now it’s ‘9-7, beware of armageddon
Bloodsheddin’ and beheadin’
Head on head collision in the valley of decisions
We locked the beast in prison

Can you help me? I’m looking for a man
A man? What's his name?
Jesus, I must warn him
You’re too late, even now he’s before Pilate
They found him
He was betrayed to them, and by one he loved and trusted, by his disciple, who sat at his left hand
Why?
Because men are weak, because the are cursed with envy and cowardice. Because they can dream of truth, but cannot live with it, because they doubt. They doubt, the fools. Why must men betray themselves with doubts? Tell them, the other, find them and tell them not to doubt. Even now not to doubt, tell them to keep their faith. They must keep faith
Wait, tell who? Who are you?

Sit down take a lesson, stop guessing
For years I had grace, saw your mad face
That only showed bad taste, run around like you’re delirious
Foaming from the mouth like you’re furious
I’d rather be serious it keeps the audience curious
These fantasies are nothing for your fans to seize
It might cause casualties
Hollywood is not your neighborhood

I burn and break and intimidate
I come cold as when the winter break
I put an end to snakes, pretenders and fakes
Shake like a earthquake,

Your pops should’ve bust you on the couch
Or sent you down the mouth
Next time wear a condom,

Though we make love to Jezebels we prey on virgins
We move like Yahuwa in black Excursions
Blood the color of grape wine
Skin tone the color of bronze
I rose from the grave with 9's
And if tears were dollars I'd feed the children
Replace the White House with a project building
I'd stand on top of it, signal in a rocket ship
Hold my dick like I lock down the continent
I'm magnetic, 
I attract metal L-shaped objects
With hell parallel niggas hit decks
Yo my hand like fire in hell after a shooting
So nigga if you know like I know, keep it moving

Fuck that museum heist decode alarms, blowing my palms
Turn the knob slowly hear the click, then we open it
Flee with the rarest canvas, called the Della Strada
A fifteenth-century painting of DaVinci's Belladona
Tie up the Pope, my man's in the Helicopter
Next to the Russian Pilot blowing marijuana
I smell the ganja showing the picture of the black Madonna
Flying over seas full of squids and arowanas
Stole the Mona Lisa in Rome with phony Visas
Disguised as a tourist taking flicks at the Pisa
My cards and my passport reads Dr. Philip L. Glascov
At the airport where the FBI waiting with their taskforce
Cleared customs, pulled the mustache off
A shootout is my last resort
Now we back in the air to the Metropolis, Project shit
Hellhole is bottomless
The beast will crawl out of it
Apocalypse, Communist
Name remains anonymous
Behold the Pale Rhinoceros
It's obvious, don't even shoot it if the shot's a risk
They say I'm too Hitchcockian
When I spit about the projects we in
I'm Jesus resurrected in the drop-top BM
I'm Larry King Live from the hood
Showing scene by scene of murder
So what's good?

Wish I could stand still and watch the world blow up
But then I wouldn't get to see the seeds grow up
Wish I could stand still and watch the world blow up
I'd be the sign that the gangs of the world throw up

Motherfuckers tell me that I live in the last days
Stupid fucks, you think AIDS is the last plague?
See man made God in his own image
Culture, language and his own limits
Even his own spirit
So he could fool other men
Into believing in his own gimmicks
Stomp the Atlantic, pivot the planet
While niggas turn their cheek to a Catholic faggot
My thological gangsta
Crying if you spit it hard
You get your bitch gang-raped by Minotaurs
No facade or exaggeration
We were born to rule the world after Revelations
You could call it God's wrath or Allah's math
Like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre slash
Bars of death when I spit 'em out
Concentration camp gold ripped out of a Jew's mouth
Melted into Swiss Banks
That's how the world works
We like the Mamluks to America's Ottoman Turks
Fill the country 'til the bottom will burst
Nazi pope
, sniper scope shot him in Church
Warrior castle, slavery surviving niggas
Harlem North Philly nobody live-er niggas
Bittersweet Apocalypse I laugh at the end

Cause when your world is over, mine just begins

Prepare yourself

When I relax my thoughts and my brain hovers New York
My third eye glides with the view like a hawk
They find my mind is automatic
Rhymes are tragic, found in the attic
Lost you in Asia, minor, find you in a laser beam
I'm supreme, my mind state is like a dream
Stargazer scarred from the radar
Beyond Gods and moms and airwaves and channels
Desert rats and camels, reptiles and mammals
Standings of Daniel, Emmanuel and Samuel
Ezekiel's wheel over tall trees and hills and mountains
Fountains, rivers, lakes, brooks and ponds
Inhabit by rabbits, snakes and swans
Energy is solar light barrelled beyond the Sun Controller
Over Jehovah through the days of Noah
Tremendous speed around the Octaman Sea
Black Sea, Sea of Caspainia
Persian Gulf all the way to Mediterranean
City of Atlantis, skin is getting tight as a mantis
Priest style is organic, mechanic seagulls, swings over the eagles
Soars over cathedrals built during the medieval
Shall remain in the ordained Byzantine Empire
Take you higher one stage as a massive fire
But still like Niger, arch rival of Constantine
Dark Ages got sparked through the stages
307 A.D. Constantinople ruled mobile
Seeking global floating motion over the Arctic Oceans
Scan the land, every inch of the sand
Never bring plans, animals, woman, child and man
Beasts and fish every inch, length and width
Come through the abyss over Egypt
A space odyssey with more angles than photography
More exotic plus it's erotic like pornography

Am I almost there?
Yeah I'm almost there?
Am I almost there?
Yeah I'm almost there?
Am I almost there?

I'm a space cadet from a tape in the cassette player
By fasting and prayer, I'm passing the ozone layer
I meditate then I'm near top of skyscrapers
View fluid nature, dropping, blew through a vapour
Then there's paper, the wind that take you
Quiet as the breath in your nose
Appear in the cold from the depths of our soul
Which has no weight, constants rotate at a slow rate
Through the black holes over rainbows in Kuwait
Destination, operation, alternation of the Sun
Circuit stars, positions seasons, I weigh a tonne
Immortality through galaxies, I'm burning
It's like accomplished, plus the compass keeps turning
Pure as a virgin, release heavy burden
I travel when I preheated the urban
Hit the firmament, shock waves are permanent
Rays of children gaze and stand amazed
So long, I'm going to the place Paul Apostle was born
Which is in Tarsus, small city in Cilicia
Then I moved south, all the way to Nigeria
Row the Tigris River all the way to Assyria
Mesopotamia all the way to Syria
Euphrates to the Ur of Chaldees
Up the Highland located near Iran
Further crescent till I reach a section
From each direction, from East to West and
From North to South, all over the equator
Neptune from the womb of the creator

Blessed be, Priest, fly 'mitri's, Dashikis
Suck from the fine titties of Nefertiti, slept in tepees
Kings bow, kiss the ring when they see me
Is how they greet me, take trips weekly
Dwell by the havens, fed by a raven
Ate from the beak of eagles, sat with Hebrews
Broke bread with the holy people
Bit from the tree of good and evil
Ate this dry fruit whole, swallowed the seeds too
Lived in the land of the strong and feeble
Some had egos, some were peaceful
Smile when they greet you
I appear, appeared through the windows
With weirdos, saw widows who played with dildos
Nymphos, wrapped they legs around satin pillows
Silver robe, holding the rose
Mexicano, latin and negros
Lived the life of thug passion heroes
We live in Projects with ghetto belly dancers
That enchant us, when you see us bring yo cameras
 (x2)
Yo, it's the view from Masada
The saga, Priest the author
The Godfather, the scholar
I write drama, deep composer, the best Noah
They watch us, build for hours
Behold the, behold the

Yo, we sip wine around golden candles
Wearing mantles, telling ghost stories
I propose a toast, as a whole splash of lightning
The sky's is stormy, then it dawned on me
It was a dope fiend and two Hell scorched shorties
That lured me, to my first orgy
Apartment 4D, met a fine Harlet named Audrey
She adored me, she seduced me with her beauty
Neck full of jewelry, she wore a see-through gown
With her eye she forced me to lay down
Then she asked me, was I new in town
And with a smile she said she has peace offerings
This day she paid her vow
Let us make love and afterwards we worship Baal
This fair lady, when she tried to play me
Get me in the bed to spray me
Kisses of her lips taste like 
Taffy
Plus she wore the scent of Tasprey
Ask me if that attracts me
Whispers in my ear are pure blasphemy
She said I decked my bed with mur, aloes and roses, cinnamon
It's a place for gentlemen, with a youthful look I entered in
The sins of men, the devil's lust, the luck of women
With cat eyes, her man's a Rabbi
Walks with a raincoat, top hat, bow tie
And walkie with a cane, puffin his pipe
Saw me through the blinds fucking his wife
I busted her twice, grabbed me by my windpipe
Pulled out a knife, 'nough said, bloodshed at the end of the night
 (x2)
Yo, it's the view from Masada
The saga, Priest the author
The Godfather, the scholar
I write drama, deep composer, the best Noah
They watch us, build for hours
Behold the, behold the

Yeah, yeah
Got to lay down the law, you know?
Masada the beloved
Killah Priest, Macabee worldwide
Yeah, pour the wine and raise your glass high into the sky
Yeah, like that, haha
Yeah, yeah, we just maintaining
Word, fuck all y'all fake ass other niggas
Yeah, what?
Yeah...",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-view-from-masada-lyrics
Shadow Landz, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"My pen's the goggle lens, rap is ATVs
Hopping over sand dunes of mans' dooms
The grip'll tell where a killer dwells
Hides out in Cancun, fucking Spanish women
Tanning in sands his hands is trembling from rubbing lotion on her
On nude beach, two freaks, she's a goner
From street corners with heat on us
Come horseback riding with a tyrant who loves whores
But acts violent, he lures old women inside tents
Gets the knife in, slicing, it’s trifling
Lighting, spells out letters as he streak across the skies
P-R-I-E-S-elec-Tricty!
Come snowboard with the Ghost Lord
This what I wrote for, this what the horoscope saw
Soar from out a celestial academy
Look at the tree of life diagram see Priest's anatomy
From the medieval family called the Maccabeez
I grew up, left the Abbotcy, now they call me “Your Majesty”
Don’t be mad at me; I’m just a deity
I took on an alias
Cause we can’t pronounce the true name of the aliens
The African-Aborigine-Israelien, King Arthurian
Half-Nazarian, half-celestrian barbarian
The Sefer Yetzirah cards said Priest is a God
Go ahead read them all, you'll still see me as Lord!
Father's Enoch, my Mother's the Sephirot
Blessed, born naked near a barn in a dessert
Placed in the arms of a shepherd
I let the truth loose, before I take exit
Laugh to myself, how y’all calling me Walter? Body never dies
It just turns to the white suds on top of ocean water

The transformation of my lines, the transmigration of the mind
See what’s in mine, a seed full of rhymes
Magicking classics, tablets go way past time
The Moon is for season, the comets for signs
When I’m writing, I have actual sightings
Come bring the good tidings, my offerings is essential
Take a glimpse into my view of my mental
I’m washing in the lonely streams
The blood stain cloth, king on his horse
Only in my dreams he would talk
Telling me this is Hell, just leave
He was compelling showing me the music industry
My records not selling, my ruins and the end of me eventually
Said if I don’t go back, the road is black, the crows attack
I step back, spoke in a rap then formed into a Golden Axe
Blood and feathers, it seems like we fought forever
The skies turned terror, his eyes and flesh turned leper
Then I turn to this heffer, she told me ""the skeletal figure
Rides a white horse slowly across the fields, this means end change
Accept that life is cyclical and that you're lyrical immortality""
Then I saw morgues around me, it got cloudy
She walked away, paused, she said ""justice will be yours
A fair decision will be made in your favor"", then I transformed into a gangster (Priest), can’t believe that I wrote this on paper
(Stranger, damn, stranger, damn)",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-shadow-landz-lyrics
Listen To Me,The Eternal Thought of Killah Priest (Bootleg),2009,"I light my candles under Saint Anthony
Burning rosemary for friends and families, for those buried
For all humanity and soul's heavy
Ride through life like an old Chevy
Look at the world through your rear view
And honk your horn till they hear you
So after you're gone it's tribute
For all the pain that you've lived through
Rainstorms are now clear blue
A king's gone on your mural, wings form in the spiritual
The ritual for those we long here's my tears and a tissue
I opened it, look how they turned to diamonds
Shows your reflection cause you're still shining
The worldly body had to do some dying
Transformation, so I leave this here with the plants of fragrance
Before you roam the land of the ancient
My mind's an enigma filled with broken pictures
The spiritual thug could see clearer now

So, just listen to me, just listen to me
Just listen to me, just listen to me

Light up a cigar let the aroma reach ya
It's like the smile on the Mona Lisa
Holding a child that rose on Easter
Like a cloud passing over Giza
Peep the style of my older teachers
Sipping Crown as he blow his cheeba
*raps in Hebrew*, the brother’s keeper
Where hustlers lead up
The mothers and grievers receive a hug from the preacher
Abundances are cousins and nieces
And nephew, God bless you
Markus daily you made the heart heavy, departed too early
You the seen the reign of stock on that dark prairie
On know your ghost floats through them bars pearly
Comfort for Aunt Chery
After cremation we dreaming their faces
In Kingdoms that’s gated, though it seems spacious
It’s meditated in Heavenly places
All human families that destined will make it
God became Man so that Man becomes God
On the land and amongst stars
Reminisce when I ran with my young squad
Cuff his hands, caught a gun charge
Bullet wounds, jailed, some scarred
Shout outs to Love, Shop, Brood, Tommy, Rocket, Sun God
From Gates Ave. Niffy was a great man
Put his face inside a stained glass
Wearing crucifixes and gang flags

His weed storm passes on then it rains down on my peoples
I see Sean Bond walking through walls
I see Mark Spark flowing through halls
Tommy Rock coming through floors
Plus continue grieving my heart
When I speak in the dark, I weep in the park
The spirit departs of Mark
Lyrical sharp as shark
From the roots to the trunk to the bark
This is my art; this is my Ark of Noah, Joana
Farewell I sail from the Narc's which is the holy body
Stained Glass paragraph, preparation of the gospel of peace
Apostle or Beast, colossal on streets
Starring at the walls till the walls become a door
The Door opened, before me was a great ocean
And a throne with my two sides, my Omens and my chosen, fantasize
I let it fly from hell or rise
Mesmerized by the enterprise starship, mega-size
God lifts then our hypnotised projects flipped its scribes
I start climbing out this hell-hole as the souls go


There's no eyeing like understanding
There's no blindness like ignorance
Better then a young man's knowledge is the old man's experience
There's no evil to sickness, nothing so dreaded as death
What's the heal for forgiveness?
Pride before fall, look inside myself and did some cleansing
Drop my defenses, begin the rinsing
Tonight a lion sleeps in the heart of every brave man
Like a cave in the African lands
The Immaculate stand to inhabit what's grand
Above is the black poison clouds
You only got one life so enjoy it now
And cherish the day before you perish away
We all inherit the grave; these are the letters that say:
Together we pray, Heaven's amaze
Shed tears in my silver Offering bowl
Incense burn Patchouli smoke for the lost souls
At the fork in the road",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-listen-to-me-lyrics
Clyramids,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The solar light made me glow all night
Become one with me, inwardly
Take these limbs off of me
Like a winter tree, flesh leaves
Shedding the body of his leaves like a breeze
Buzzing like a bee
Infinity, my center being
Divinity, I inner breathe
Higher awareness, higher of self bliss
A ball of energy pulling the chi from my pelvis
To believe to be free and careless
'till out of my body, the shell lift
Warm, calm, gone, psalms
Inner prayers to find my inward stairs
The center chair is just there
Nothing compares, how one become pairs
Back to one into layers, becomes clear
I'm not dead, but not alive
Only inside, the inner vibes
Snow leopard creeps upon me
But my surrounding changes to palm trees
The praying mantis, enchanting
With a swaying standing, advancement
My head turns seven directions at once
But I'm still staring at the front
A journey to the shortest distance
Sort of like a resistance
As the rigor mortis stiffens, the coffin's risen
Absorb and listen, I'm orbiting, I glisten
From wisdom I'm given, all in my system
Till it comes out of me like a prism
I'm fringing, cringing, looking for that emblem
Staring into the darkness inside myself
Cosmic calling for someone else
But the voice just echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes
Finally my soul let goes
No more depressed soul
Looking down a threshold
My heart begins to beating, I start believing
I start breathing
The art I'm conceiving from a dark region
No more pyramids, but these are clyramids
Changing to pyramids, this is my puramid
-
(Hook) x 2
This is the journey to see Cairo
Inside my soul
To seek higher than what I was told
Further than ancient Egypt
This is ancient Me-gypt
Hieroglyphics exchanged for tattoos
Believe it
-

The nine visible attributes
During my lyrical path, salute
Drop the jewels without parachutes
The math come in groups : Love, joy, peace
Long-suffering interrupting my being
Abruptly seeing
Gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness
Temperance, deliverance from outside interference
Join the experience, the spirit go inward, in
Remove the nine thousand year cloth, I cough
Arms coming uncrossed
Holding the Ankh for months, and millenniums
I spoke like many of tongues
Counting backwards from infinity
To the first century
All the way before B.C
You still can't figure me
From the song I did from a Didgeri
I am the temple, I am the pencil
I am the mental, I am the symbol
All tremble
I'm the peninsula to your state of mind
The inventor to the greatest rhyme
The adventurer, travel quasar time
I am the eye between the crack of dawn
I am the weight that broke day
I am the pilot aboard the higher planes
I'm the conductor on your train of thought
On your tracks to your past
Tunnel vision, wisdom
I am your opposing team when you're in the zone
Just to bring you home
Who am I? I'm just a poem",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-clyramids-lyrics

To give you vision 

Intervention
Life adventures
White winters
Israelite upon the night remembrance
Celebrate existence
Snowflakes take the shape of a bright empress
My cold hands reach for the princes in linen
But then there’s shoot outs
Drug wars
Liquor stores
Cops kick in the door (yo yo what up?)
Visions of war
Prison ward so high
Bodies stiff in the morgue
Drug sniffin dogs piss in the halls
They frisk us on floors
While hitting our jaws
Twisting the laws
System is flaws
Wisdom no more
Hating ourselves
Gated in hell
Overpopulated
Those that thought they made it
Still taking our wealth
Raping ourself
Pyramid falls
Into stone man lakes
Most high would call
We used to hear him from space
Mosaic laws
Appeared in our face
Angels applaud
Mothers embraced
Strangers explored
Manna we taste
Cosmic thoughts
Turn my brain into a gothic quartz
Crystal
Now Israel
Kneel before a coptic cross
God knowledge was lost
Used to be flossed
Now its nudity taught
Your beauty decoursed
Light menorahs
Recite the Torah
Anoint my head with white waters
Bright aura
Welcome to the psychic life of Walter
Israelite Christ talker
The sky walker
Faithful Gabriel angel
Husband son wife daughter
The righteous order
The sun light the moon night
Yo who’s the author
I write by torture
All so the good life can offer
Street reporter
Priest speaks to pro tools recorders
The wise man
From the highlands
Hold our wives hands
Righteous eye scan
The mind span
The tribes stand
We’re aryan
The most high’s plan
If the eye brand
Skys is tanned over the hot sands
Yo we entrepreneurs since dinosaurs
Yom Kippur
Palms on floors
On Rosh Hashanah
Love thick as a rasta’s ganja
Twelve sit in the father’s honour
Natural mist was cast upon us
The tea ceremony
The holy of holies
Sacred testimony
The trees a bodhi
The priest were bony
They pointed slowly
Showed me it was me
In Nairobi
Teepees of the Hopis
Inside it was smoky
The chief spoke ghostly
His eye was stony
The sky was snowy
The vibe was cosy
The tribe watched closely
I got at them with poetry
Culturally
Nobly
Vocally
Ultimately
Globally
Totally I flow Jehovatry

Yea, mothafuckas

This is +Horsemen Talk+, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk

Don't you know the shit could get real when your ass get smoked?

This is Horsemen Talk, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when you wind up smoked?

I spit volcanoes, twist heads, spit lead
Then boast like the angels, the scorpion tongue
Come close I'mma sting you, I'm Morpheus' son
Part two to The Matrix, I'm atheist
Only God is my gauges and the clip is my church
Show the beginnin' and the end when I'm spittin' my verse
Voodoo curse brought back The Horsemen from the grave
Four headless mothafuckas now clappin' their gate
Stomp his chest in and put the fuckin' axe through his leg
Chop his head off, cause the livin' mothafuckas never seen the dead walk
'Til now, Horsemen spread his corpse across the ground
Priest pick niggas off that talk, with a pound, c'mon

This is Horsemen Talk, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when you wind up smoked?

The headless Horsemen nigga
I'm back, give me a fired up Mac
Seventeen different satchels of uncooked crack
Dogs don't associate with cats
Horses beat niggas with metallic wiffle ball bats
If time could rewind I would have rewound before
Knocked down, surround and drowned before
Concentrated, ligaments separated
Pronounced un-hoofed with the hoofs pound
I'm Kurupt, Young Gotti, the Headless Horseman
I'm the one that started off extortion
Contortion began to spread to scorchin'
Featherweights came with the enforcements
And forced the enforcements I'm forcin'
And open the doors, let all the force in
I never really gave a fuck what it's costin'
Time ain't money cause I take my money
And I take my time when I take my money
I'm always careful when I make my money
I know about niggas gettin' quaked by money
But The Horsemen here though
Comin' through with the Hennessey and dough dough
I'm lookin' at the niggas peepin' out the hoes
I start cookin' mothafuckas like kilos
(*horses neighing*)

This is +Horsemen Talk+, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk

Cock my Beanie like Anna B C, Gwen
Release the beast, G heat, creeps beneath me
Like the over fiend ET with DVD
Feasibly he see beyond 3-D
We the glitch in The Matrix
Neo - ""these niggas got computer code runnin' across they faces""
Temporarily trade places
I define Hip-Hop and transcend it
Take linear time and bend it
The biggest lie ever told, ever since the 13th amendment
Was whoever told you, you could contend with men with tremendous?
For rhymin' magnum mentality, for rhymin' over instrumentals
Flow like menstrual
Mena trois menaces, murder fresh-maker like Mentos
Rock like cement, cum like semen
Judgmental demon, mad lizard
Y'all niggas is fembots
We bend blocks with big shots
And kill your little homey like Kid Rock's
I kid you not, kick rocks or kick box
I'm like a one legged man in an ass kickin' contest
You're gon' get your ass stampeded repeatedly
And immediately Hannibal Lector gon' feed it to me
Please believe what you see
Or see it to believe it
Heard men are from Mars, that's why I floss on Venus
Wipe out the species, extinct ya whole genus
So fresh and so clean this
The OutKast of rap, Horsemen attack
The only thing gon' pop is my collar and a gat

This is +Horsemen Talk+, Horsemen walk
Get the fuck out the way before The Horsemen stalk
We headless mothafuckas and we lacerate
Don't you know the shit could get real when your ass get smoked?

Use a dull blade and sever ya neck
You're whack because I say so
In my platoon niggas like you are good for peelin' potatoes
With your manicured hands and gay flows
I murder your first born after it's only a day old
Rip the Jacker rips the track up
Rippin' rappers, eight sack, rippin' that ass up
Niggas back up when I attack with my axe up
Swingin faster than Tiger Woods at The Masters (FORE!)
I decapitate you faggots
Then gallop over ya body with a horse and carriage
Kidnap ya widow, fuck her in a wooden cabinet
Pass the pussy to Priest and let him stab it
Ask Ras and Kurupt if they wanna get at it
Laughin' like madmen, swallowin X tablets
Natural born spitters that mean business
Millennium niggas, got the Sword of Gideon wit us
And we all got a bone to pick
Niggas talkin' about frozen wrists and how much dough they get
Go to war with them like the Bosnians and Bolsheviks
Put an umbrella up they asshole and open it
While I'm still holdin' it, openin and closin' it
I break they motherfuckin' pelvic bones with it
I will sabotage, everybody knows that shit
A nigga spittin' like me ain't supposed to break
Now I got a formula that's guaranteed to work
The Horsemen, remember you heard it from me first
Four niggas that done been through it
With more knowledge than the Druids and the will power to do it
My cranium pumps uranium
My first name's Germaine so my heart probably pumps Germanium
When I die, they should have my wake in a stadium
You can witness my body beamed up by aliens
Radiation poisonin' that will probably make ya skin fall off

The Offering,The Offering,2007,"He rules in the neighborhood he rules
Huh try on your robe man, yeah it fits it fits me too
I like this ""Emperor"" huh priesthood
The offering is now brung to 'em
Show us how you do this talent (what the fuck is this)
It's like this look

Nonchalantly I plant the words in the brain like ganja seeds
Horizontally the way I write Gandhi
Beneath a palm tree's calm breeze
Like the summer in the late 40s
Before the mob kick in the door
Of the Don squeezing automatic Tommys
Ablaze of glory that's how he lays
A lamp shade Duke Ellington played
The screen start to fade cut end the story (cut, cut, cut)
Yo the next one opens up soda cups
A bottle of grey goose in a room full of applejacks hats
Cock ace deuce sam remo laced boots tapping the floor
A lit cigar goons got my pops liemmed up with gats to his jaw
He said ""where is the child that said to come from the Nile
Now in the PJs"" he paused and freebased did a line (snnnniff)
""Not to be sublime but the kid is ahead of his time
He turns Kool Aid into red wine
Besides that he professes
He should be the next king of BK (sniff)
Besides Kane, Big and Jay
GZA was underrated but still
The Words from the Genius was the best stated""
I ain't scared to say it back in the day we had groups
Like the Dismasters, rest in peace Mike Ski
""Part Time Hustler"" ruled to me
Divine Sounds, Disco Ritchie and Shelton D
I take it back what people do for money
Money money money the offering

Pay your tithes and your offerings
This goes out to my niggas in them closed coffins
OGs who was coke snorting
On death row, dead men walking
And them mothers never had abortions

I come to bring y'all ass whippings
Rappers this y'all disaster
As it's written he is risen with mac slugs
AK shells a mask and gloves
They made their Hell
A basket thug and hollowed be thy tip
Anoint your forehead and empty a clip
For the average y'all spit
And I hold my pen like a syringe
Inject my paper with the thoughts of a gangster
Scene 3, nullets sail threw his Tuxedo
He fall for dead in the corner of the cathedral
Doves flock to the ceiling chirping
The murder of the godfather
It's just my version a tied turban
Rest on the god's dome
Science study the structures of my jaw bone
It's similar to the great pharaohs
But I dealt with the streets and space travel
Big Priest from the ace apple

Pay your tithes and your offerings
This goes out to my niggas in them closed coffins
OGs who was coke snorting
On death row, dead men walking
And them mothers never had abortions

See the offering is pureness straight up hip hop
That's what I'm giving you know
(Yo hold up man yo Priest what happened to peace?)
Oh; oh yeah peace peace peace peace peace

Greed made ‘em thirsty for money

I need a knot, shit is gettin’ hot
The others said, “What could we do?
It’s on you”
He stared ‘em down as he passed ‘em the brew
“Hmm, maybe you see my view
Follow me upstairs on the eighth floor
And I will show you the door”
“The eighth floor, how is that?”
“That’s where my cousin is slingin’ crack
Be grand whatcha y’all niggas is puss?
Y’all seem shook, to have niggas ambushed”
One other kid said, “You sound like a savage
Couple of years ago you spoke mathematics
I peeped your ways now you carry automatics
And try to give niggas traffic”

He stepped on the elevator
“I see y’all crab niggas later”
“Call your cousin, and warm him of the setup
Before the brother gets wet up”

Essential,The Offering,2007,"The night's a dark lord well dressed seducing our sun
Upon the dawning of her full day he usually would come
Galloping upon his winged horse
Leaving trails of stars across the planet the night scene of New York
Comes to life with lights pubs clubs with thugs
Mobsters gangsters criminals dealers with drugs
Loud music crowds are moving up and down blocks
In and out of spots cops watch for a foul shooting
So how we moving my soul scour through the clouds
Where the moon ah sit
Like the wise owl searching through a gloomy mist
6 will bring a casket down to its tomb
Another child gets pushed through the uterus
From the womb we're intuitive
Eternal peace or damnation depending what we do with it
A genius or a lunatic
A general or a fugitive it's essential...

IT'S ESSENTIAL
(Talking)
Word
IT'S ESSENTIAL to be a man of your word
Take care of your seeds
To the young kids honor your mother
The greedy night is full of demon smiles
And every hustler wear horns
And every fiend comes from the ground
The FBI got satellite radars screening our child
Jacking off to our chaos the beast get aroused
There's another world with under bosses rich not into flossing
Put hits on certain lawmen
Who pick who runs for office
If they switch then the guns are brought in
Who parted with professional ball players with big endorsements
Who love to trick on hoes that sniff blow in bathroom toilets
They alcoholics go through mad divorces
See their wives in the papers with half their fortune
Then there's the mob leaving tips a hundred bucks at the bar
Big spenders around the dealers shuffling cards
Evil laughter puffing cigars
In a room full of goons tats cover their bullet wounds
Rats are pulled from lagoons
Mexican mob doing shots of tequila live niggas
Throwing up knots in their pictures
With gang signs at the same time
If crack was awards and could frame 9s
You would have plaques and coke scale and money stacks
But there's another party with Presidents CIA intelligence
The federal defense Executives with the Aliens Iraqis and Israelians
And by the time of my demise the one who talk to Cain shall rise
The second time while Abel blood rains from the skies
And who knows where my soul will fly I'm near a cemetery
On top of a dark hillside it's essential...

Keep it health
Always keep a clear mind
Look at the world in front of you

Snow fills the night air, as the wind throws her thick white hair
Across her face icicles appear fall from space
Like tears white frost light flakes
I'm with my peers remorse at the wakes
So many cats I know I lost his way
Sprayed up by bullets I'm in my Woolrich
We cross them graves my man spoke mad hoarse from pain he said
""Yo Priest, just think of what lost today""
The city lights look like the ice around a rich man's wrist
Where every hustler big dreamer prays it grants them a wish
By myself right off the belt till hit the Van Wyck
Cruising jigsaw my thoughts I need a plan to exist
Should I get on it like them Cuban Guerillas?
Fly to their country make a truce with their killers
Move in a villa
I come with few of my niggas they come with theirs
We politic on struggle and social affairs while toasting beers
My man had cunning ideas to get rich with mobsters
But what if it didn't prosper?
Look what they did to Hoffa
My feet buried in the sand out in Nicaragua
Or on a cruise out to Venezuela
On a ship with a pool designer clothes and expensive tailors
Sipping cappuccino favorite flavor is French vanilla
Exotic foods catching shrimps no more menace failure
The Offering is the movie my others albums were just trailers
I can't hardly sit through the news watching fictional tool
Political views the sky is dark as the original Jews
Subliminal clues left in the hieroglyphs
Where the ancient empires exist
Walk inside the cliffs in Cairo read papyruses
On a wall full of gaul of Judas the disciple's kiss
At the last supper nowadays it's the microchip in the skull

IT'S ESSENTIAL",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-essential-lyrics
Alien Stars,Planet of the Gods,2015,"Priest the magnificent poet
I walk inside a Hindu Temple
Tripping while I fall and transform Into a trail of lotus
Then disappear like hocus pocus
When it comes to stretching ideas I do aerobics
So start flexing your joints
Because I won't stop till I'm done stretching my point
The art of the rhyme started in the mind
A paradigm shift sperm hardened into a spine
His spine turn into the caduceus
The two dragons begin the looping, I ride to the gaze of Anubis
The Mayan stars to turn different ways like a Rubik's
I could take a topic that's worthless
Boring eyes in the popular searches just by dropping these verses
I'm a prisoner of the moment, so when I see a pen, I go in
I start my sentence, I hit my bars, that's when it begins
Now my fossils is found in the cosmos
Link with the bones that they found in Morocco
Link with the mic that they found in the Congos
It was guarded by people wearing the ponchos
The burial plot surrounded by bronco's
Standing on hind legs, behind him was a cave
The anthropologist stood amazed
This is divine soil, the paranormal
Prime-mortal that came through a time portal
To rhyme for you, can't trace my race
From a different time and space, I was never designed from an ape
Was never a primate, I'm from a place, called the mindstate
Wait! My first nation was called the imagination
In time, we became determination
To put substance in the perception of oneness
Spinning spiral threads, creating a cosmic spider web
To catch wonders, in all planes of dimensions of matter
Counters of information and data
Balance of mental sensations we gathered
The carriers of light, through the triple stages of night
Then I blew greatness into phrases that I write
In the land of Erech, when the madness entered
Only when the Father repented and the Sabbath ended
The land of Admah where Cain explained to a scribe
What happen between him and his brother when he died
He smirk as he commanded his army to do drills in the dirt
He said, ""You know what really hurts, after you departure
I really have nothing left"" and by the time I'm deceased
I'll probably transform into the Angel of Death
And re-enter your atmosphere, dragging angels by their hair
Fire and brimstone raining from his spheres
Blood and crowns fallen while we sit on our horses
And I laugh as I look at my family portrait
I figure I found the first city
And knowing in their heart, they showed pity
Who want to rule the Earth with me?
The God of the Garden, the first son of Nod
The brotherhood of the marking
Detached Lamech and Tubal-cain
Kill em, the removal of the brain
The land of cannibal, the mistaken me as an animal
Now mistake me as Hannibal
Thousands of elephants impaled on the fence of Heaven
This mountain shaken the gates, I'll be a legend
He turned around, screaming ""victory"" to his brethren
Which turned into skeletons in seconds, he turned back
His flesh also melted in the face of the army presence
No weapon is formed

Kings die
God's live on
Planet we on

So don't contest who's the best lyricist
When you rhyme like from the futuristic time of period
Also you rhyme like you climbed out of a pyramid
And you shine, like you returned from a pilgrimage
Or a shrine, like the minds that designed the Book of Genesis
And mankind, made in Our images
When your message like the Epic of Gilgamesh
When your imperfection is accepted, you're limitless

I scared myself

Democracy,The 3 Day Theory,2010.0,"Can-I-Bus, wash off the rust
This is prophecy, I ain't just talking tough
Democracy Rules Everything Around Me, D.R.E.A.M
They put me in charge of the new Tiger Team
Illmatic, still savage, still at it
Mechanics build the rhymes, I build the mechanics
Binary language, trinary programming
To copy rap flows nowadays no challenge
Smoke don't rise in the opposite direction
Overhead projectors don't stop till perfection
Gallop over the poles, after the election
The master of impressions, like 
Zecharia Sitchin
Permission to get crunked up, ask the instructor
Big Brother, nigga lover, want lyrics this summer
We live in tumultuous times
, I must be outta my mind
Recording rhymes like I'm soldering wires
Behind giant porcelain tigers
 with needle nose pliers
They told me I was hired, so I left with those buyers
My shit got less talk, but it's a bit lighter
Tell General Myers I'll fix both fighters
Situation or awareness in all areas
Knowledge is the disease we are all carriers
Of Flownitis, flow the nicest with no guidance
From the Hip-Hop - anti-virus
Sun rises, 30 arc seconds the sun spot crisis
Put fucking blisters on your iris
Ten observations per satellite
The higher masses orbit the rhyme, the faster I write

First let's take away the planets, erase the stars
Delete everything in the solar system and the concept of God
Now it's just us standing in the darkness
I invite you to a contest, its quiet complex
You want light? Use your conscious
You want sight? Create a content
Your diction must create friction
Sparking thoughts as they listen
To enlighten someone confused
Watch it burn down to where the thoughts stems from
It's like a pen when it goes into a gun
From within, explode, then it's done
It lights like the glow of the sun
Imploding the black dot
Then explode or blow to a hole to a black spot
This friction cause a resistance
Which is the cause of all existence
These laws are Scientifics, so pay attention
The method I use, connected by tubes, digest it like food
I complexed it for fools, they can't keep the message or jewels
I left it for you, place the record on spools
Now the speed is 33 seconds per move
And rotation, that's the globe creation
Light up the whole nation as motivation
The sky had streaks of white fire
The angry cloud noise, entices the writer
Mystique alphabet, brightens his eyes up
The syllables connect, his eyes become fire
Like the Messiah, he begins to talk in a rhythm like tension
Grabbing the mic from outta the dimension
He begins spitting, split atoms
The rhythm had 'em in a trance
The rhythm enhance, his sentence advance
Till he begins to look like a lamp
His head grew incredible, impregnable
Impossible, what letters could do
It put me in a pedestal, Priest of Nazareth
I came back like Lazareth

High Explosives,Heavy Mental,1998.0,"I'm a space cadet with a tape and a cassette
Player, mind faster than prayer, I'll pass through the ozone layer
I meditate then I'm there, high explosive
Lyrics are high explosive...
Chorus
Been up, dated, microphone mighty king David
My eyes have seen the spaceship, Lion of Judah
High exalted, mystic ruler, black stone call me
Abduler, skin made of solid pewter, my wisdom takes off
With such great force, global space walk
I breaked off leaving legs, frost, shake the planet off
Cause different ships, mountains and cliffs, planet shifts
Mind drifts, this is it, I've been abducted
No longer stuck with, the corrupted
9 to 5 puppets, I blew away my change, buck it
Bite my crutches, the faces of the public
Scream for justice..
Chorus 2X
Stalked like Moses, lead the hopeless
Raise ? water hoses, I stomped the devil like a bed of roses
Drinking wine and eating raw locus, mind full of high explosives
Armored tanks stay focused, I get ferocious
Turned to the black lotus, I'm only here for a moment then I'm gone
I teleport, throwing bodies on the third rail, scorched
I smell a corpse, I stomp through hell with a blazing torch
Riding a pale horse, with the pitch fork, my head full of sick thoughts
Leaving arms, ripped off, my legs are criss-crossed
I start to sniff salt, witches and dwarfs
Cut you, back and forth, horizontal, do your kung-fu
While I haunt you, and bring horror upon you
Licked my ?, and stomp you, I run through your kingdom and conquer you...

What Part of the Game,View From Masada,2000.0,"Oh so you a killer now?

O so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
So you sold mad drugs?
O so yall gangstaz now?
What part of the game is that?

First of all everybody can't mc
Second of all, y'all all sound wack to me
Third y'all sound like a group of wannabes
Either it's 2Pac or another B.I.G
Here's the truth for ya rappers, be ya self
But y'all scared to do that, cuz won't see no wealth
Matter of fact when y'all leave the ring leave those belts
I ain't gonna stop till every word is felt
Most of yall cats never bust no gats
And most of yall cats neva sold no crack
And most of yall cats better thank god for rap
Cause most of y'all left the hood and can't come back
Believe that, niggas ain't trying to see no plaques
Specially if your pockets are fat and theirs is flat
Niggas like an applause, ever heard of gun clap
Ever heard that click clack, rat tat tat tat
Damn money what part of the game is that?
So yall gangstaz now?
What part of the game is that?
O so now y'all thugs?

See a lot of y'all cats never been upstate
So why ya getting mad and all bent out of shape
Gangsta rap? Come on yall was on roller skates
And now ya trying to blow up on the next mans mistake
I've been broke to long to let a nigga rob me
Be up in ya lobby, at least 5 deep
Creep in ya crib and pop 5 in ya sheet
Pop another one nigga trying to rob me
We ride in these streets, survive in these streets
Niggas get high, niggas die in the streets
Fuck that, I roll up on the side of ya jeep
In the range asking for change, hidin my heat
Get smart, I let one fly through ya seat
Through ya heart, leave a nigga lyin beneath
2000 who wanna side with the Priest
And I'm lounging all my niggas playin for keeps

Oh so you Biggie now?

Nah you think you Pac?
What part of the game is that?
Oh you a warlord now?
What part of the game is that?
Hey yo Ras tell em
What part of the game is that?

I'm live evil, I know live people
Anxious to bang ya wit heavy metal like Magneto
Now who really on some gangsta shit?
Not every nigga with a stomach tattoo, bandana and a click homey
You ain't dope just cuz ya sniff it, or lace ya blunt with it
That just makes ya a wack rapper and a drug addict, get it
These niggas rhyme like they AK spray shit
Sell a ki of yay shit, gotta ride, homicide, every single gay shit
Get smacked in the streets by some real nigga who don't play shit
Hit the pavement screaming it's just entertainment
And that ain't it, life sucks like fumigation
My obligation, expose all ya funny bunnies
Rappers actin slash fudge packin for the money
Cuz next week if the new fad was hip hop fags
You'll find a lot of these thug niggas in drag, believe that
Oh so you a thug?

Nah you a gangsta

You are the love of my life
You are the love in my life, my life
You are the love in my life, my life
You are the love in my life, my life

With God control, I take a photo of the globe
Like a space probe, let your tape roll to roll
My ways of life shine purple rays of light
Ways that are right take long days and night
Then I enter where there's no interfere
No sense of care, tense at the prayer
Then we exalt like cities of Lebanese
Drop with heaveness, must be Heaven-sent
Left with evidence, ever since you left
Seventh prince, and the pleasant scent of sweet smells
Exhale, I'm as deep as a well
Watch Priest prevail by fear and love
Let's soar through the air like a dove above the star circuits
Where Allah is perfect
It lies like an olive tree, woman follow me
Through the galaxies, just acknowledge me
We'll walk the calorie across the Sea of Galilee
I give you rubies for your beauty, you look as fine as jewelry
I chose the finest, your highness
I chose the finest, your highness

You see my instructions are not silver
In knowledge forever then choice gold
For wisdom is better than rubies
And all the things that may be desired
Are not to be compared to it
Our wisdom will dwell with Punics

You're my one and only, during our holy matrimony
Attract my homies, subtract the phonies
What it manifold, make a man explode
Love episode, give me rest when I'm old
So clear and unbefouled, plus running wild
Caught you as a child, brought you under clouds
Never earthquakes when I'm home from work late
Never forget your birth date, I love you
Damn your understanding have me hunger like a famine
Prepare for landing, for landing, for landing
Aborting the River Jordan like a RZA recording
Fourth Disciple, bring forth the cycle

Gods of E.din,Planet of the Gods,2015.0,"He first appeared with workers and engineers
Through the Earth’s hemisphere and the Ozone layer
With angelic space gear, the Sky God
That travel in celestial pods of bright stars
The father called his children, the children came down began building
A technology brilliant, they flying stealth along the Cosmic Belt
These gods had help, but the help disagreed and went for self
That split the team of the Elohim, they came for Isis blood
The Nine wore righteous above the 24 sat on the left and the right of the judge
Carried their creation across the darkness to the Earth they set up bases
One shot a laser and left craters in their faces
They had lovers and enemies, discover the infantry
The Mother of Divinity storm like wizardry

The gods of E.din the stars there’s a meaning
Who do you believe in Angels or Demons?
Did man come from Earth or somewhere in the universe?
Who was here first un-pure birth – Gods of E.din?

Givin’ birth to a race of reptilians in the base of a pyramid
Escape, create apes before the Genesis
Genetics impregnate the gods Kings were beheaded
Workers were murdered, along with the seven scientists
Meaning of Orion’s Disc
Spirit Kings put Zion at risk, did the Mayans know this?
Or the Sumerians? Winter Solstice fill the Vatican with explosive
Then there was war in Heaven, the angels were spiritual weapons
Verses alien god legends all brethrens, Michael with his rifle
Anu and his disciples, wars before the Bible
Destroying stone work in a huge domed church
Catacombs out in Rome digital network – web search
Can you perceive god consorting Eve?
While Adam slept after eating from the tree of knowledge
About his colleagues and the walls in his palace
Adam never had a naval,  Adam was never born
Adam the angel fell from storm, made after they form he was warned
Anu verses Set, the cube is the net if YouTube is the set
He chopped his body into thousand pieces

Lotus Flower, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"His heart lifted like a glass of champagne
Fame Streff off his name from Brooklyn projects to hoods in Fort Wayne
Stand and applause by the hands on the clock
Above the audience watch pitch dark as he stood on his block
The night is agitated D's invaded with affidavits
Places faces and cases some were crack related
The young dude stood on his Q spoke to his crew
Words were smooth watch how he move
Glock on him to fly words that's in the ears of his peers
Words sincere tie not prepared 89 in fly gear
Before our eyes he took it there, said this is Sodom and Gomorrah                                                              years are numbered days are shorter
We need to switch up study the Torah
Kick the Shabbat change our name and call our brothers ak
I'm tired running ducking from cops
The crew wrestle with thoughts
No longer the transport and hit lil man off
Too many transplants in our camp we loss
I knew this judge his words was exceedingly strong
Unnaturally warm handout sentence like a storm
Rain on your boar from his horn
It was classic how he took the weed and passed it
Dumped the ashes and blew out the cosmic gasses

Bridges of dark matter giant clusters of rocks
Harmony of the universe a trillion years of buzzin lights
The only thing the cosmic world rose petals and snowflower water
Drawn up to shower fills up the macabre
To love is the true meaning of power

He sells his drugs and alcohol and they Rich
Took a fall become poor because of snitch
My will stands as pillars of Testaments
Repent to restrenph there goes that weed sent of peppermint
Stay focused the final hour approaches
Just try the coldest The Lord drinks from the cup of the sort saint
Magic fire Choctaw Indian we cover our face with warpaint hold up I think I need more ink
My arm the tattoo Lady drawn the sphinx
Silver needle that oolong tea that green and white in the winter mountain
Where they pick tender leaves we brew to smell aroma
God called but I hid like Jonah, I'm in my crib studying yoga                                   healing my ulcers ride the cosmic Wave like Noahstanding in the Celestial court caught thought till it's over

We're going to turn it on
We're gonna bring you the power

Peace yo, yo my name is Priesthood
I’m from a planet of a thousand suns
A million years and I came down to your galaxy to MC
Know what I mean?
I’m from a time called forever, that’s eternity, know what I mean?
We get into this right here, uh, get into this, yo

Amazing platonic solids, rhyme tonic with knowledge
Robotic machinery hand blasting mic rockets
Take off then dock it, futuristic lizard with lyrics
Jewish mystic descendants, Hindu with vision
Temples, Hasidics with Christians that listen
My mission of them, who came to Earth first from a star burst?
God-shirt warm with pockets of conscious logic
Cosmic garments, doctrines, Lord Marduk from stardust
That God touched, planet’s space product
Fell from grace to hard luck
My wings became arms, feathers became fingers
On that day it stormed, my face grew meaner
Till it screwed to a cruel demeanor
Chasing money pursue till the beast bring his crew with FEMA
There will be war between us forever

During the battle Harlock realised the Zetons were trying to lure him away from the Earth, leaving it unprotected
So he turned away from the enemy spaceships
And chartered a new course back to his native planet",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-opening-lyrics
The 7 Crowns of God,Elizabeth,2009.0,"Escorted to my torment, my pen opened up the coffin
It's horrid and quite awkward
Let's walk with, Walter, forward
See me trying on God's ornaments
The hooded King gleam like porcelain
Y'all seen the portrait in portions
It immolates greatness like 'The Offering'
Prince of the presence - The legend
To befriend, to call them brethrens
But that's dead when, you fill his ears with poisons
What's his origin? You're supposed to enjoy friends
But instead you try to exploit them
Now you trying to avoid them
Shape-shift your weed branches with fire
Blow out the negative gases, I rap with passion
Not for fashion, to provoke reaction
Your chances are slim for being shady
I'll have all of 'em relapsing, I spit classics
Open your mind and your mouth is where I fit the magic
Open the canvas of your thoughts is where I spit the graphics
 (x2)
A-alikes is like mind
A-alikes is like mind
Day and night I write rhymes
Day and night I write rhymes

I'm chasing destiny, past my future, it's therapy
Telepathy, look at my face, see a ruler
One day riding my scooter, the wheels came off, became horses
The seat became a chariot, my yard into a fortress
I'm sitting off a cliff, the sky open, begin talking
Telling me my fortune, saying I should be hit with stones
They should break my bones
Leave me on the ground and die all alone
Bud out your bones
I will stack it like Legos
The dirt I will stretch it out like Play-Doh
And form a body, then breathe the breath of life
You will be resurrected with mics
Then form a hex with light
There will be no copies, you are mine
 (x2)

Now hold on, let me explain
God captured greatness, shaped it into a form of a brain
I was born to be king, 'The Offering' was drawn in the flame
But this time adore me with rings
Not gold rings, but rings around Saturn
Check the pattern
Of rhymes I wrote, and that I mastered in
Okay, he mix greatness with immortality
And added God morality
A throne spoke the name of Priest
From a palace on the mountain right off the sea
It said the 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'
I perform lyrical sorcery
God's tailors made my regalia
Lightning from my fringes, and thunder for embroidery
My hand that candles, offers two CDs
The secret private life of plants
The diligent and militant, commodity and colonies of ants
The spiritual and telekinetic mind of children
All rolled up in rhymes that are chilling
Black Lost Tribes of Israel, official
With bars of truth
Chopped up in crystal, no fishscales
Baking powder of Satan power, devoured
Pots of boiling water of Torah
Though the dragon with his legion of demons screaming
In my coke kettles of slaughter
Place a capsule of your rap dudes to take back to school
This is something to relapse to

Guns for gun streets filled with rivers of blood
Raised in the PJ's with real niggas and thugs
Eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood coming to a theater near you
It's all love
Guns for gun streets filled with rivers of blood
Raised in the PJ's with real niggas and thugs

I'll make Mussolini wear a Kufi
I talk like Dr. Ben but look like Malcolm holding his Uzi
Peering through curtains who would I murder?
Pearl silencer screw on my burner four four caliber
The new Nat Turner I'll make Hitler wear a yarmulke
KKK celebrate Kwanzaa
Should I pursue further?
I'm like Tutankhamen with the tools in my garment
Put a few in my cartridge the moon and stars lit
Light up the hood it looks like a techno club
We slam dance to this music when the Tek blow slugs
It's ghetto thugs, welfare and poor education and gang love
Sitting in the Federal waiting
(Hook)

What did Malcolm think split second before he was shot?
Did he think to hit the deck on the floor before he dropped?
Or did he just say ""Fuck it"" I'm ah die for my brothers?
Cause by killing him just made his words teach others
Like Martin Luther King he preached peace
Like the West East beef finally that shit is rotten
Place yourself in the shoes of a people's leader
From drug kingpin to President either is off the meter
Your best man can turn it or squeeze ya burn you and leave ya
Beside a lonely road or inside a meat freezer
That's the way it goes on the 3rd rock from the sun (earth)
Alone circling the light were we begun where we become
A follower to a general with soldiers to run
They move off every word of your tongue
Fearless and ruthless when you was young pulling your gun
Not scared to shoot shit remember it was all in the fun
If it's power you wanted can you control over a hundred minds?
And these are grown men who've killed over a hundred times
Every champ team has an arch rival
And it takes one time to mess up and niggas don't like you
You start to want peace, niggas want you deceased
Your money low, niggas want you to go
Who else but I can bring the most haunting flow? (Nas)
You soon to see the best of me
From a boy man to a king hear out my destiny
(Hook)

When my fam is at stake
I think of how much slander I take
Then I sit back and watch tapes on Alexander the Great
I start studying how he bloodied men
I think of rappers I'm a massacre
Metal armor cover my skin
Take me to war, fuck y'all
Priest is Ivan the Terrible
Stare at my eyes, they're unbearable
You collide with the generals
Surround me like the most high
Surrounded by Cherubim
Who'd imagine the illest collabo
Priest and Nas are incredible
He's spits ether, I spit urancha
Describe how you devils move
Scream on MC's as I recline on my pedestal

The reep of presents, I reach for my weapon, stressing
Compulsive disorder, I step closer to the alter
Confessions, a preacher touches my dome, I soak in the water
My presence is there, but I can't see it quite clear
But I can feel it, next to my nine, there's a bottle
And there's a spirit, I feel sheer bliss
I've been baptivised, but I still feel bad vibes
From niggas, used to shoot fair ones, but now we pull guns
Quicker, I took a lip from the liquor
Took a hit of the L, the mixture, had me feeling sicker
Paint a dark picture that flicker, load my clip up with shells
The air got thicker... two more shots of Tequila
Stare at the mirror, the face is too familiar
The reflections of a true killer, whose real
Though I'm drunk, I pick up my pump
Stand looking like Huey, but slumped
It's Nostradam' and Saint Thomas, with the uzi in front
My Garden of Eden is apartment where they puff they trees and
The serpents alerting through the weak secretions
The earth's scent from a furnace, quiet, Priest is teaching
Big Apple's a hassle, project tabernacles
Telling stories through the urban tattoos
Bullet wounds, some serving capsules
Thug Vatican, Priest lounging between two Greek statues
You try to front, and the heat'll clap you

Hot as a bullet that went in Abe Lincoln
Your page is the inkaholic, addict for drinking
The hundred proof truth, pouring down my platinum ink pen
Niggas is slipping, niggas forgetting
The child of Medusa's risen, twisted snake heads
You should envision, ice grill ya'll to stone
Hypnotism, born with intuition
As an infant to keep me living, my moms fought off bats
Giant size, flap your wings, sicks with attack
Crying eyes, the next rapper king to react
The science God, is to know thy self
To civilize those around you'se a slow process
I release on my own recognence
My sirconscious, on a track as bomb as this one
Ear's to intertwine with, I kick a verse
Til M.C.'s get the curse

Struck from a bass drum
Then I would pass the pad like glass to my man
And he would take some
He used to shake from
Overdosin, we both endulgin
Eyes were bulgin, remaining focused
But the brain was frozen
It's the same as smokin
We would just stand, just stare
Film would appear, and tapes would start rollin
It took us way back like a-tracks, it's so amazing
My man used to say that, this ain't rap
'Priest, your lyrics, are too vivid'
'They more like pictures, you can feel it'
'Yo, you gifted', it flows like liquid, mystic
I never witnessed such things as beautiful
As unusual, like a musical

So say 'Black August', and that's the chorus
It's so gorgeous, it's so beautiful, unusual
And 'member y'all this is no rap
These are moments captured on a kodak
So hold that
So say 'Black August', and that's the chorus
It's that gorgeous, it's so beautiful, unusual
And 'member y'all this is no rap
These are moments captured on a kodak
So hold that
(So hold that, so hold that, don't hold back)

Yeah, yo, yo
Music fallin
Like leaves in autumn
I hope you caught one
Please hold it close to you
It's for the pupils, of the new school
It's chicken noodles
It's vitamins, rice and beans
A nice cusine, you like it steamed
Or broiled?
Grab it like soil
This mic is royal
My pens a needle, my arms a notepad
My thoughts a dope bag, my rooms a coke lab
I cooked up tunes
My homie smoked tash, and used to throw cash
Out of born fishes, they want the raw lyrics
Shoot or sniff it, you call it
Alcoholics listen
Smiling, while nodding off, mumblin
'This kid has talent'
Then pass out, while spillin they quarts
Then open up another gallon
I smoke from a chalice, who wanna challenge?
I spoke inbalanced
Priest the magic man
Presto, there goes your ghetto
Colored, increase your level
You gotta love it baby


Yeah, uh huh, yeah
I get em with the rhythm
Twist em, spittin like exorcism
A poets wisdom, give em vision, dialect
Just listen, to productions
Let it flush your system keep discussions
To a minimum, watch me I'm winnin em
Those imprisoned from the bling-bling
Locked up like sing, sing
Until I ginseng root
Right into it like a fruit again
Sight to the blind, speech to the mute, yeah

It's all day man
I can't believe what I'm hearin
You know what I'm sayin?
What I'm seein, it's beautiful
I could go all day long, it's the life
Yo, I could just keep going (Priest)
Yeah, check it out, yo (Killah Priest, baby)

My heart is jaded, star gazin, R rated
Nickel-plated, manipulated
It gets better when it ages
So amazing, I say 'Amen'
So majestic, emotions like a slow record
It's like a epic, or a shiny necklace
Catch me at the guestlist
At Black August, check my performance
I'm brainstormin, rain pourin, no need for umbrellas
I'm tryna tell ya, best seller
Thoughts angelic, soft like velvet
Take off my helmet, the warriors home
Like Centurions in Rome
You know what I mean? I just zone
I could go all day with this

A locked cellar, watch Hell'll
Freeze over take ya' lower
Break ya, boa constrictor hit ya' like Liquor
Tipsy or sober, whiskey in your soda or vodka
Chop ya' with a blade made of copper
Kick your head off like a soccer - ball
Raw alcohol and it's over (arrest over) in October

It's gettin' cold, gon' punch a hole through your solar plex
(And it's Over) I mark X on your chest
It's Over (The dead bury the dead)
Ain't gonna be no rest

Just pretend, watch me blow like the dust in a gust of wind
Flow if you rush when I adjust the pen
Take you miles, and miles, and miles
Leave you at the river of the Nile, Now
Deliver the foul fact
Found in a pile in the stacked
Books that were took
Take a look - back, as I take you further higher in to the sky
Where ya' eyes like visions, Surprise!
We're died back risen, building of aeons upon you peons
Knowledge, yo crazy Knowledge we be goin, OFF!
Now your lost, tossed in confusion
Saw an illusion of the car that started cruisin'
Actual day, Mathematics brought rage to his attic
What's the weight of a flame? State your name
But he was afraid of the height, glazed at the light
Strayed, couldn't stay for the flight
Ran to his book of rhymes, it took up some time
For the brother to hook up a line
As if he had a fishing rod, but my mission is God
Science I be dishin' out be hard
Deep in his eyes, contacts, plus saw beyond that
Saw the brother couldn't respond back
Try to rhyme after me and hold the weight
But the science done dropped, yo, the nigga's shoulder aches now Let's take a trip, travel through the mind
And play the trick when he unravel the rhyme
Bloodthirsty no mercy, when I find a victim, he motions
Stick em' with potions that I've developed to make ya'
Body swell up like venom, once I'm in em'
Then I skin em' and skull em' after that I call em
Back from the essence, who the fuck want more lessons?
It's over!

Know what I'm sayin? It's over
The dead bury the dead, it's over
Your career -- it's over
All you wack MC's (finish em up) -- it's over
Finish em up

Blast, burns back in to elements
Development of the gas around the mass of the Earth
Hunted and iced
Were we nod through the forty thousand
Miles that occupied by people cars and houses
Over this, your mom was just browsing
Thought I was part of a cult
So, I dispose over the bogus and focus energy, toward the enemy
I ain't burnin' G's, chemically for affinity, Attack!
Third eye, what occurred my, vocal formed into a storm
With loud thunder that left him in the crowd wondering
Now, you wander, on many thoughts you ponder
Fell asleep, tryin' a seek the beyond-er
While I would ponder; microphones, reciting poems, strikin' domes
Hear frightening moans -- of HORROR!
Speakin' evil Hebrew from the Torah
Slammed the mic, it turned to a serpent,
 open the curtains
Show em' things he couldn't interpret
Destroy the Earth, fill it with gunpowder, cables, sun power
Build it in one hour
Then reveal it through a sunflower, sure to shower
Showing the power of the Lord, Messiah
I absorb the fire, water, oxygen
You can't comprehend to these strange doc-trines, stop the winds
Beyond the orbits of Dionne Warwick
With no broomsticks and magic tricks to this
Return of the Iron Maiden
Stomp your corny ass like the Raven
What's the matter? You frostbitten? you lost your mittens?
I seen you under the cross submitting
Seeking remorse from the Christians

It's over!

Huh, it's over!
Your careers is now, finished",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-its-over-lyrics
Happy,The Offering,2007,"A homeless man smiles at me
Showing no teeth
A young man laying dead in the cold streets
He was a victim, beaten bad by the police
And every day another funeral
There's more grief
And every day I like to pray when I see the sun
And if there ever was a lost tribe we the one
In every hood, there's a project with us in it
The old man in the dust goin' nuts - finished
Years before they used to say
He used to own a business
Caught him on taxes
Guess you're black
You got to know your limits
And everybody try to be happy some way
I think of dinners in the winters on a Sunday
And everybody's poor
But we always pulled through it
Cause of Marvin's influences
We always played his music
My pops said he was a troubled man
Courtesy of Uncle Sam
Then I hit the streets and start hustlin'
But I can see my grandmoms when she dressed for church
A stylish hat, white dress with a matching purse
And I could hear her singing loud with the choir
Marching in, with the face of joy
Proud cause her heart's with Him
And she could live everlasting in pure peace
No longer worried eyes, speak to him before I sleep
And I stood by the door when she came at me
She said ""You got to endure, and learn to be Happy""
(James Chorus)
Stood right beside me
Look deep inside me
She had inspired me to be
Happy
Stood right beside me
Look deep inside me
She had inspired me to be
Happy
My friend wrote his mother
""Mom, I'm doing better now
My last year in college, told you I wouldn't let you down
And how is things around the house?
I know you still fussin'
I finally heard from Ralph he said he had appeal comin'
He wrote me last week, told me him and dad don't speak
They both be actin' like they kids if you ask me
But anyway, how come you never wrote me back?
This is like my fourth letter to you
I was hoping that
You could send me something
It's gettin' cold winter's comin'
I know you standing, laughing
Saying that I'm up or into something
I love you mom, Sincerely Yours""
As the nurse paused
From reading hers letter body attached to a cord
Into a breathing pump the stroke she had was too much
She's in a coma, been that way for a few months
And if her son knew, believe me, he would split in two
And going back to using drugs before quitting school
But just smile, cause your mother's still here
Try to live, and be proud, make her heart full of cheer
Fill your mind with tranquility, she's free
Give your hearts space and liberty and then peace
The words are golden, emotion, devotion
Just hush, feel her touch for a moment
My life's paradox, watched by crooked cops
But the Lord carries me, just to be
Happy

Dedicated to my grandmother, Ms. Louise Staley
I love you, Grandma",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-happy-lyrics
Citrin,Planet of the Gods,2015.0,"Gentlemen you’re about to witness lyrics by a chemist
Witness biophysics written like hieroglyphics
Predictions like Bible scriptures traditions and tribalism
So step right up see it all if  you’re quick enough
To get in line for the most prolific rhyme

Any clear idea what you’re trying to trace?
An asteroid, an orbed mineral safe in a shell, a shell of stone
With power, in this shell something travelled to the Earth
Alive – as far as we know it
Is there a fifth planet, there’s no doubt about this it’s giving us CS sequence
It’s the Asteroid
What’s the distance?
Something over 500,000 miles

Where these stones were once computers is tomb raided by looters
Excavation rumors said these rulers died from a tumor
From the Land of Sumer, sat around blowing hookah
The unknown off the coast close to Montezuma
The ancient man from the future
Raised on thoughts of Buddha
In the page I lost my humor
Now rage is my consumer now the rhymes are incredible
Format impeccable concepts intellectual
My page is bi-sexual my pen grabs its testicles
Cause the mind is very flexible
I fuck with the track because the rap could be edible
Digestible medical terrible incurable
Identical to hetero terrestrial  for his genitals
Rap professional I can reach celestial pinnacles
Or catch a mineral place it in the subliminal memorable
Remove the nitrates watch his mind break
As his soul vibrate at a high rate
His spirit gyrate at a speed he can’t titrate
Brains broken, it’ll never work again
Malfunction

Now I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition
I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition

432 Hertz I put in this verse A elder from Earth
Welded the universe into the heavens and hammered the bracelet
Around the god’s basement then going into myself
Then coming out multiplying the creation
By adding and separating playing with the magnets
Of the planets the size of thought is gigantic
Engineering the data on my writing base
That’s where all the gods would gather - life in space
Increasing the lights in the matter for size and shape
Throwing the matter into the stratosphere
Am I clear can you hear picking up some static fanatic
New exhaust memory loss wintery frost on your mothers board
Impale a rapper then grab another sword
All gauges locked to prepare for shuttle war
Shoot nukes from out my booth
Send rocket dogs envied the size of parachute
The comet at night, the Cosmic Christ
A cross, made of quartz, you’re in a gothic night
He bleed til his arteries shut off
I put his conscious on ice tombs with air compressors
For the ancestors – to wait. Roll back the stones
I’m coming from space I told him he’ll never repair again
Take him through currents and RPMs take off his head then his limbs
Rip him apart then put him back together, Press start
Destroy his ego with the torpedo sharks
Took the Citrin from the planet Saturn
Placed it in the Garden of Eden for Eve and Adam
It’s for liberation and Karma, check my armor in rapping
I took Armageddon and placed it in my pages for ages
As disaster

Yo I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition
I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-citrin-lyrics
Looking Glass,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"Uh, looking inside my book
Uh, one time, uh 4th Disciple
Uh KP, dimes, uh, in the looking glass
Live for everything, when I open up my book
None for nutting knaw'mean?
Seeing the looking glass

Life and Death is like a carnival in cemeteries
Ain't nobody left that's honorable they all been buried
The Chronicles, from Muhammad schools to Gods name vary
Black people are the promised Jew's cause we lost already
My cross is heavy, I carry it - this is my burden
Look in the sky! See chariots, why the Earth is just burning
The worst is determined by the birth of a person. I'm also hurting
Soul searching, I go to the sermons of elder Gerry Burns
Life as a failure, my worries return
I know cats who could of went pro
Wasn't born with a silver spoon to his mouth
But put a silver spoon to his nose
He was nice in football but every time the hood call he would go
The projects is like the insane asylum, full of gangs and violence
Pain and problems, heavy rain I hear violins
At funerals, it's the usual - explain this knowledge

Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass
Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

The pastor preaches, wives and widows open their purses
Throwing dollars hoping one day they meet Jehovah in person (The Lord)
Miracles; a man who can't walk leaps out of his chair
Saw the same man a week before walk up his stairs
An old lady who can't hear, she just stares
Showing no facial expression
She's a victim of racial oppression
Her grandkids she pray Angels protect 'em
A knock at the door - it's agents and detectives!
""Your kid's been hit by a stray"" (Oh Lord!)
Another dollar got to find a better way
Another day, another lesson, life stressing
Dice games, liquor stores and pool halls
Money on the table, spot that Q-ball (Rack 'em up)
Winner takes all, now rack 'em
The nine ball symbolizes the planets
The last ones to get the black one
To get 'em you have to crack 'em
Listen to this ""innerstanding""
Absorb is more than just gambling

Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass
Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

Remember 
W.D. Fard Muhammad
The prophet that gave Elijah his knowledge
Elijah gave it to Malcolm
But on their way to the promise they ran into problems
And only through death they resolved
From the Mosque to the school up in Harlem
'Cause 
Clarence X left, started his own set
Gave a new breath of fresh air to the projects
With the 
Supreme Arithmetics
Young teens got hip to the devils tricks
But in '69 the God got hit
But you can still hear him when Poppa Wu parts his lips
And there was 
Dr. Malachi Z. York
 with deep thought
Called himself ""The Lamb,"" ""The Nuwaubian,"" ""Godly Man""
Built his own Egypt on the top of the sand
Then there's 
Yahweh Ben Yahweh
, called down UFOs
All these men the U.S. knows
It's like our mind deteriorated when drugs came in
And it took us back to the cavemen

Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass
Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

God’s Time,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"My pen's a microscope
Beneath its lens show real life I wrote
From all my sins to my righteous quotes
I look within and realize there's hope
I begin to cringe, struck by lightning bolts
From outter realms I saw Michaels bow
The angel'll sin just like a ghost
I begin to cleanse, speak under the Bible's oath
And when I end how many mics I broke?
Begin to live the words Christ has spoke
They're losing the friends desired most
The half-less mind, their chance to shine
They blast that nine, that glass of wine
They handed me insanity
Vanity families of humanity
Stay with me through calamities
The dark skies have electric fields
See the wheel within wheels, impregnable skills
Thousands of volts from post lasers
Nonlinear optics behind quasars
Within the triple stages of dark there's a black stars
Around the universal cosmic, lost NASA
Somewhere there you'll find my raps but only have bars
We gave the devil his time, now rebel in the mind
The ghettos designed to keep us sleepers
The grim reaper meet us, poor education
We explore revelation
War of the nations, claw of the pagans
Washington, watch Shaitan
See the mission through man made religion
In the floor of Masons

Shout -- x9
Live -- x9
Love -- x8
Gods Time -- x5

From money and wealth, you'll ugly yourself
The hungrier I felt with nothing to feed me, streets will mislead me
Where the eyes are greedy, I vibe on CDs, his eyes on TVs
The cause of justice and missing no expectation
No interpretation, I'm cold with vexation
My soul is a wreck waiting
Recreation with mind and spirit combined let's feel this
It's time we hear this, mind is sheer bliss
From being rebellious, overzealous or too jealous
Make us failures, mistakes from elders
From being careless, god help us, Satan held us for decades
Time to cross over to the next phase
The atheist is amazed at this
Awaketh thou sluggard, why covet thy brother
Consider the ant that gives it to the plant
The plant gives to them, so be it to all men

Shout, shout, shout, shout
Shout, shout, shout, shout, shout
Live, live, live, live
Live, live, live, live, live
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
God's Time -- x5

The Devil trembles when he knows the body's the temple
And God is in you, it's hard to continue when it's hard to offend you
He starts to set traps, that have you setback
The last round in this death match, so strengthen where you're best at
I promise you won't regret that
Was I regarded as Job? Or should I take the carpenter's role?
It's dark in this hole, that's as far as it goes
Harps of gold, impossible, pot as a rose
Remarkable soul, the resistance, instincts intakes a poisons
The devil's enjoyment is so annoying
Exploiting, morally destroying
Around a flag their serpent's coiling
My spirit's boiling, it's simple
If we sin don't do it again, ask for forgiveness
This privilege saves us from max in their prison
Attraction of wisdom, not this plastic system
The faction, we victims
The aspen is venom, relax and it's your ending
Families deprived of their lives
The archives, lost tribe, pork rinds
But it's a new era, a new beginning
A new ending, a new time, only a few inches
We getting closer, you choose, you make a decision
No collision, turn off the television
The Hell in women eyes and males we like we failed the mission
It's disciplince, militance, no tolerance for the ignorance
We live again, refuse to lose, spark minds it's God Time
Every bar in this line is stars aligned
Turn on the searchlight, see we the owners of the birthright
Reverse the curse like we sold the drugs that's owed to us
Let's get what's owed to us, what's really owed to us
We bust the guns when we was young
Now it's change a higher plane, the sky is in my range
The third, I have wings

If I Die,View From Masada,2000,"Now I lay me down to sleep
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he keeps
If I should die, before I awake
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he takes

If I die, may the sky turn forever gray
Neglect the moon of a light, turn the sun beige
May the Lord open up every grave
Every prophet that was slayed
May they roam the earth for thousands days
Give 'em a body of a slave
May the Lord strike this earth with pestilence and plagues
If I ever lay, may they cover me with weed, ash, hip and sage
May every thug raid, may they bust in gauge
May every judge pray, when they lower my cage
And my flesh return to wet clay
From which I was made, my bones rot and decay
If I rest eternal, may the Lords send great inferno
Till this day I write my journal
Journal, urban journal (Lord)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he keeps
If I should die, before I awake
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he takes

Dear heavenly Father
The reason why I stand at your gates holding two revolvers
'Cause down on earth I had mad drama
Protect my body from the tabernacle of robbers
I pray that an angel take my body
Before the doctors have a chance to do an autopsy
Burying me near Bob Marley, or even Haile Selassie
Surround me by his Israeli posse
What I know shocks me, the seven heads of Giuliani
Six-six-six, illuminati
And Lord make sure they mummify me
I put every word in my diary
So in time, every eye can see
Send death to the world, that's haunted
Kill 'em with torment, let the beast rise, that lies dormant
No more life insurance or police warrants, for me

Now I lay me down to sleep
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he keeps
If I should die, before I awake
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he takes
Now I lay me down to sleep
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he keeps

When I was born gynecologists surrounded my womb
Now I'm gone archaeologists surrounding my tomb
They suit me up in perfume, in that small church room
Don't cry, I be back to earth soon
Felt the fever of thieves in my blood
Born to live after the sunset of the world
If we die of another man's ignorance
Remember Lord, they ain't innocent
Before they acted nigga-ish, tasted hell bitterness
Swallow my tongue, like a licorice
Though, running through his naked wilderness
Mad as a jackal, with the dry mouth
That prowls the grave at the time of drought
Bury me near King David
Somewhere in the oasis
Fill my body with Godly fragrance
May I sleep with the ancient
Feed my flesh to the ravens
Wish death on every pagan
If I finish my night in some gutter with my throat cut
By some fake friends who had me doped up
Fill this whole planet with smoke and such
If I'm murdered like Abel
May I fall in the arms of an angel
Fuck a close friend, they can change too
Return to the earth as Gabriel, hosting my own funeral
Looking unusual, may the earth choke and spit up my coffin
Use my body as an offering
God bless my offsprings, (show him the way)
If I die tonight (show him the way)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he keeps
If I should die, before I awake
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he takes

Body of Light,Planet of the Gods,2015.0,"Rhymes compressed in the complex conscious
Context concepts its contents
Here to comet, come pest conquest is accomplished
On the planet till the mind launches
Thoughts teleport to the realms of darkness
Like a cosmic starship, subconscious where God sits
Standing on the shoulders of the galaxies looking at a New Reality
Above the Earth, beneath Gods balcony
Through the Universe through the eyes of the storm in the forms of an Odyssey
Shooting torpedoes at the evil from the wheel of Ezekiel with the wings of an Eagle
I come to heal the people, snatch the seal and reveal the Hebrews
Nimrod birthday, day of Christmas
Food for thought out of satellite dishes
I snatch out your biochip, rearrange your manuscript
Make you into a brand new kick
A secret life of Daniel Smith, a robot that will grow in a box
Put codes in his clock, your head explode when I flow off top
Four kings ruled for seven thousand years
In a time heaven fell from the spheres
Priest, the legend would appear
With Angelical weapons in his gear
Like war-hammer, helmets with deer antlers
On the throne with pair of panthers
Warlocks and Witch elves with the powers to switch realms
Got owls to spit spells, got knives that will split elks
Warrior face with thick whelps
Why need a fountain of youth, when I’m surrounded by Zeus
Well rounded in the truth, giant fist pound through the roof
MCs get hit with the nukes
I arrive at the door of immortality violently
Those of challenge me, I have a dead MC gallery
A mortuary with heads on the doors are scary
These raps walls are heavy, get grabbed by the paws of the hairy
I kill MCs, destroy their souls
Catch ’em at the crossroads with crossbrow
On a spirit horse surrounded by red crows
Like I read those dead scrolls
And the dead rose, Angels breaking their bones
Their wings turn into stone as they're returning home
Into the divine realm from the mortal world back to the mind-elm
This rapper’s a juggernaut, what I jot is the brother lot
MCs are turn to the pillars of salt
Killah’s a force, revealing the source, still in the vault
Made with the steel and the bolt, like Peyton Manny I’m standing
A plethera of greatness shaped into a crown of praises
God of the ages, sacred language found in my pages, catch phrases
GodzWrath, bars of math and science
Vampire Vikings Insane asylums, tyrants and Lunatic Island
Trials of witches, bow for forgiveness
Head full of stitches, bed full of crickets
Peaceful walks through the cemeteries
Hail Mary sends the worry
Body swinging from the tree of knowledge, Adam and Eve
It goes slower and slower
Purple lips, the hand's getting colder and colder
On his skin were a bag and stick
On his forehead is written Judas, I left the game with music
Came back engulf the flames with shooters
With Ein Sof, the name of the rulers
Mediate on the will of the star trooper
Tea running down my face like Buddha

The Dogon lift up the Trilithon
The Poem-Killah had formed, the Rap Christ lay on pillars of thorns
The 8 Deer Ocelot Claw, prophet on walls
Great as the Lord, great is his name
Swinging sword at cyborgs and robots
And y’all go watch wind-up toys, ya niggas get your throat chopped

The Book,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"From black planets I fell from space
Through a neon cloud, to touch down created a 
Nephilim
 race
Chased my bad spirits, six wizards captured me
Hid me in the village
Durin' the earlier periods where I crafted my lyrics
Assassins will hear it, paid by the Popes of the Vatican
Lightning flash, it was grim
They wanna put daggers in my skin
Soon as I grab the pen
What would I reveal that they're scared of?
I guarded it like 
bear cubs
In this war, it's all fair and love
Their Cardinals were arguin' in front of the dragon statue made of marble
They wanted the novel of the Street Apostle
The thieve gospel, what was in the book that had 'em all nervous?
What was the purpose? They gon' on a serious of murders
Grey smoke raise outta the bullet holes thru the Stained Glass
Held by six ceremonial dressed Presidents, Rabbi's and Arabs
(Hook) 2x
Our Father, who art in Heaven
I will be thy Name, thy kingdom come
I must bring out guns in the name of thy son
And the Holy Spirit make my enemies feel it

Raised around killers in lobbies wit sick smiles
Wit nines in their belts that'll shift crowds
Weed smoke turn to thick clouds
Shorties do the weather report
OG's sip 
Crown
, in this grave is where the rhymes are made
Crimes engraved, in the brains of the adolescence
Adults pressin' charges
Regardless if they wasn't raised by their fathers
Deadbeat daddies, in the street wearin' khakis
Hangin' off their asses, 40's in their hands
Shorty is gon' be a man, you in ya 40's, no money in ya pants
Is this what they're really afraid off, or all of the above?
An Intelligent Thug, gun to the president's mug
Take it in blood, niggas hatin' on the love
Back shootin', 
crabs in the barrel
I stir the soup till it's brewin'
Pour the whole barrel in, this is when the battle'll end
Passion of my pen, craftsman wit the lens
Or is it the injustice of our Government?
Spit 48 bars of coverage, Ark of the Covenant
This art has my blood in it
(Hook) 2x

Flames of brim pebbles, stream of fire
I drain the tires screechin' off next to a corpse in the streets of New York
The dead corpse get up and talk
Warnin' me off the brothers in my own fort
Suddenly my bedroom turns into a court
The corpse turns into a judge
The judge stares across at a jury that found me guilty
A misjudge of character; I was embarrassed of my action
Cuz... I thought I was supposed to be friends, count my blessings
The Counsel in question, mount of confessions
At the time of the arrestin', they said I was finished
My time is past, but wit my bare hands I grabbed onto the grass
Pullin' myself, now all I needed was Brooklyn to help
Begin kickin' paragraphs that the hoodlums had felt
They begin openin' the Bibles that they took from the shelf
Pray for them, that they spitefully use you
I stepped back, start examinin' who's who?
They said I had a head full of loose screws
Priest! I kick the flows that'll scrape the new school
Blood in my vein, its runnin' true blue
How did I know? They make it known in my dream
It could be somebody in your own team
That wanna pull the throne from underneath
I slid, under my sheets, still asleep
Everything I was shown was deep

Uprising,The Offering,2007,"(Priest talking)
Yea I'm gonna come back and do that watch
Huh what sup here we go man
I draw deep rhymes in hieroglyphics
In tribal pictures of niggas survival some with trifle endings
Stuck in the beast the three sixes Bush recycle Hitler
I swam through menstrual cycle bitches
Blowing the widow spider kisses
Word to Christ disciple of them bible scriptures
Decipher my lyrics you see my coming my predictions
Witness my mind dimensions my rhyme adventures
""Wait"" rewind this sentence check for clues some are missing
It stuns my vision but my 3rd eye is like a Cyclops
It sees deeper than the niggas on my block to Comstock
I can see further than my eyes can look past all the murderers
And all the crooks in the law books trying to beat their case shootouts
I'm a flee that states 3 to 8 it's going to go down before I see the gates
Priest the General crown with the five emeralds
Byzantineal side with the criminals, livest interviews

Yea nigga pass the crown around nigga
Put your money in this the offering nigga
Pass the...pass my crown nigga yea its gonna
Go down check it
So read your horoscope in the bars I wrote
Priest the project ghost
I show you tales of shootouts in the cosmos
Hold my rhymes like a tarot card close
""Look"" see the black prince that wears a dark cloak
Looks kind of Goth though
In Heavy Mental I showed you my art growth
Look at my silver sword swinging in the calm snow
But in my imagination these fallen snow flakes
Could make the globe shake
And leave craters in the earth that rotate
This one's for Israel revolutionary fist held
Both legs impaled by the devil's dagger I stagger
Let off a clip then fell
I lost my grip slipped in the pits of hell my crown fell off
Down a hole grabbed by a million tortured souls
Burning flesh as they tore through my clothes
This arch angel stood my body up
Lifeless but righteous handed me a pair of cuffs
Alright then the sky cut with streaks of lightning I ran into 'em
Like a Bison eternal fighting forever

4 Tomorrow

The cargo ships rocked in ocean tides
Their freedom watched from the open skies
Cried for his chosen tribe
The great Amistad wave goodbye
You'll never see her again
Currents of strong wind
Took niggas on the long ride
Naked have I came, naked shall I leave?
This hell I see, I've written it in my form
So if my time calls you can press play like it's yesterday
It's been a decade since the best say (

Y'all hear 'em again, my serum's the pen
If death follows, so lie for now
The apostle, grace be unto you
Till the coming of shallow, I wrote this...
(Hook) Priest

What's sufficient for the ears?
Redemption is near
The hope of Christian, religion is listen but fear
This desire put us back in bondage
To weak and begging elements
Living devilish in our conscious
We became monsters
Cause all we want is the chronic and some liquors
And tat on some scriptures and I miss my sister
Pictures haunts my mind, it turns realer
Look inside my memories mirror
Heron had her in sedation, till she became an AIDS patient
Her last days she laid shaking
I stood by her grave waiting
For the preacher to finish his sentence
I dropped the rose in the hole then I left repented
It took part of my soul; turned my soft heart into stone
When I strike my chest it hurts my hand
Is our freedom even worth the plan?
The dope merchant glance
Then look back at the fiend like ""you heard the man""
Who wanna take a stand? Hopes are hollow
The adolescent hand chokes a bottle
No role models, wherever the streets leads ye shall follow
(Hook) Priest
(Priest talking over the hook)
I see the future
This for the future man
Ha-ha, I want the future to hear me
I want everybody to realize
That when I sat and I wrote this
This was for...

He quickened my heart after foolish women ripped it apart
Swimming in a dark sea that was living with sharks
The last enemy to destroy his death, what's next?
Given the power, all things wicked will end in an hour
The corruptible, must put on end corruption
All this and his destructions
God to men discussions, he looks at us in disgusting
Sky erupting when my pen is touching
Deliverance from this ignorance
Idiots are oblivious, it makes God furious
Surrender yourselves, ye members of hell
Offenders are given to jails
The devils agenda's to get in oneself
All we wanted was help, the common mind is blind
The honorable is hard to find, there should be no sign
Liberty is defined, the spirit must be circumcised
It's deeper than just tribute time

Devotion to the Saints, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"Hehehe, you know I guessed it
You would be the only one
Who would dare to come here, you got courage
Huh, hmm, before you get a chance to fight with me
You must observe our rules, and meet these two swordsmen first

Whatchu know about steppin' out the crib like it's 20 thousand
And all fives, dust still in the fridge
Either or, yo, I rock like a meteor
Bitches know when the kid's high cause I fuck with the TV on
Winter time blowing, had the suede boxers
Petite fillers for the whole team, eight watches
Ladies and gents, watch me, every line is snake venom
Creepin' up on your brain like Excedrin
Blowing out veterans with a speech impediment
So underground I stay beneath the crevices
Bitter wars over coke stores
Arabian jewelers keep hitting me off for the cross
Shiek's wealthy princes and ayatollah
All I gotta do is kick a verse, they like hold this
You my nigga, dun, word to the light on the phoenix sun
Want you to take my daughter, give your queen a son

Halt, you leap me? That's right, I have heard you're the master of dragon's sword Right, hahaha, maybe, but try me

NY fitted, Jordan 13's on the feet
Splash blood on my threads, how I murder the beat
Like medicine to infants, out of they reach
In a charcoal seven with the chardonnay seats
Now my name ring, I played the born, and bare the storm
Now I made king, I weigh my arm, and they respond
Stay gone off that haze and Don, game long like
Triple overtime, overtime stay strong
The great one, fake none, put it on the Bible
See me face to face, look me in my eyes, deuce
Spartacus flow, soul cookies in the vinyls
Only time I go soft, raw pussy on the cycle
Your highness, INS, darts catch your body
And all a nigga saw was the sparks from the tommy
Papis split the fishscale raw, copping polly
Big brother Rollie on Deck, got it roxy

My rap is like a holy drug cart, documented in my sentence
Around the edges, sold my presence of my life beginning
For born bloody swarm, early to a Godly finish
To naysayers throwing stones, hoping I'll diminish
The skies open, til I rose from three or four dimensions
With great rings, less then the dollars the grave bring
Meet the afterlife, chapters I write, with great king
A spiritual , hearing from beyond
They talk to me through a cloth coofie, Lord's beauty
And I'll admit through gems of life, I lost jewelry
Amongst the land dwellers, never trust what a man will tell ya
They give you stone for bread, you found dead
With no dog to smell ya, passing acid in your liquor glasses
When they pour it, have you throwing up blood and courage
Just a week ago, you spotted them walk in
With your enemy, and you recall it
They wasn't mean mugging, they were talking, plotting on you
But God made me unnormal, your diary rise
Breathing the immortal

It was mean, while I'm fixing
His identity, overthrown by the republicans
But our people are still suffering, I am determined
To reorganize this justice, to help our people
By overthrowing the republicans
So help me to regain our position
We will overcome the republicans",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-devotion-to-the-saints-lyrics
Salvation,The Offering,2007,"IT'S WARRRRRR
(Hook)
We are one, we move as a unit, this is our mic, we are one!
(Who is your general private?)
Killah Priest We fight the ungodly
With the righteous sword of justice
And we will follow him all the days of our life
We are one, we move as a unit, this is our mic, we are one!
The plot was to stop the Nazarene break up his black regime
Smash his dreams from being the greatest that rap has seen
They laugh while scheming on ways to stop him having cream
That's blasphemy to not mention his name in magazines
Luckily the young warrior had mad esteem
He kept writing, back in his lab he hit his pad extreme
And in the midst of all the chaos he took half his team
Called 'em Black Market and Maccabeez
While the serpent use the worldly things to attract his queen
Broke his heart she played the part Mary Magdalene
Hissing his words that the other side of the grass was green
But I ain't trying to hold you baby go ahead flap your wings
Gun in the waist of his baggy jeans stayed strapped
Yankee cap above his durag lean
Police that pass flash sirens outside his projects
Where the dealers push crack to fiends
There he did some soul searching now he's back redeemed
Look at his album cover stained glass of the king
Wallpapers of gangsters hang up
Next to King Solomon Amen Ra and King Tut
Beneath that incense burns frank incense the fragrance of the prince
Priests the saint the angels fight in his defense light the hemp
It's bright take a glimpse at the crouching statues
Within the tall fence of his castle
(Hook)
I called on Michael, Gabriel and Uriel to pull me from hell
A jury of twelve await my burial they said they want my great material
My vision blurry can't tell I hear the bells near the church steeple
Where Rafael awaits his fate break the curse of evil
I'm holding rosemary beads it's scary roll the hairy weed
Inside the blackberry leaves
Its cold but what worries me will my crew leave when they bury me come hurry see
The Brotherhood climbing a hillside at the fall of darkness
The night arches over the projects
As they speak of the legacy of Priest the artist
They share words of his hardship
And he sung his psalms to a harpist
His garment was blood soaked
Around his crown he wore halo of blunt smoke
Below his navel his guns poked
So may this Offering give your thoughts wings?
May it fly high start soaring pass the corpse of kings
Beyond the cloud scraping mountains
Travel the way of the falcon
To a tucked away enchanted Island
You land see the ruins of his old palace
The wide stone steps that leads to his throne
You see his face made of hard stone
He just sit there and zone
My eyes are open but they're empty as the painted eyes on a doll
Walk inside the fog sit beside my catalog
See his face? It aged to something strange come in range
Upon his sculpture grows weed vines with small rosebuds
So show love to the Priest revelations and this is my salvations
This is my salvation
(Chant)
(Hook)
'King of Mysteries, who wast and art
Before the elements, before the ages
King eternal, comely in aspect
Who reigns forever, grant me three things:
Keenness to discern your will
Wisdom to understand it
Courage to follow where it leads.'

Travel foreign countries where they bury mummies where Monks be
Travel to Istanbul to the castles of Hungary
Studying my Chakras, drinking ayahuasca
Gave me psychic thoughts
My spirit God morphed into a Jaguar
My brains took off like NASA
Ran around the jungles fast as NASCAR
Talking with the faces of the Egyptian cat God
Chewing holes in the sky, follow the black star
The tarot card shows the Avatar
Meet the priest named (Drakkar?)
Told me focus on the inner-Lotus, notice the petals
Voice sounded kinda Polish, enemy roses
This old Devil, I'm the cold rebel, Slash, Othello
Parts of the mothership is inside of the Ark of the Covenant
Cain received the mark for his punishment
From the hand of God, then fled to the Land of Nod
Where he camouflaged, lift the candle see a scar
Embarrassed he vanished and start to scavenge
Then found the people that were here before his parents
There, he took their women, hand in marriage
Bare children that will soon invade the planet with killings
And declare their selves as gods, but what odd?
Who were these people from the Land of Nod? 
There lied a King who ruled with vigor
Stay with me so don't lose the picture
You want a wife you can choose my sister
You see my kingdom we can make it bigger
We are the serpent people

He told me I should save you

PWOWR (Problem Solver), The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Light the incense it gets intense
About to invent sentence after sentence
‘Till the chapter’s immense
To capture the listener’s interest
With this creation it’ll take a little erasing
Lots of meditation and concentration
Above me, the moving constellations
I move my lips like I’m conversating
Ideas are combinating
From five spheres of a conscious Oasis
Amazing, wait ‘till the rhyme begins aging
I'm like all nations in the body of one man caged in
Shooting rhymes from where planets are incubating
My ink starts spraying, bones are decaying
A throne is awaiting
I zone on these phrases

I can hear the angels

I write scrolls
Took the clothes of my future
Performing lyrical Kama Sutra within my medulla
Extracting the negative like a juicer
Attracted to her letters I seduced her
Now I'm standing naked in my thoughts
Exposing the body of my memories
My mind’s genitals connected with space minerals and releases relativity
From male to female changing chemistry
Inside that invisibility gave me the ability to be visually lyrically
When I squeeze the pen, it releases effergin
It gave me black swan bumps beneath my skin
Perform lyrical lobotomy
See the odyssey
With the proper MC
As the sun sets over Tibet
The monks pour me more tea
As I write near the stream
This is more than just poetry, with the pen I'm quite extreme
Just a project kid but when I write it gives me the insight of Kings
My mind goes way back into the cradle of knowledge
Angel Gabriel standing before this toddler
The bib of high science
I build a castle out of rhyming
I'm the capsule and the vitamin
In the womb of space
In the nursery of thought
In my room I would create, rehearsing my verses I would talk
My Similac was the pen in rap
My three eyes were the lens; it begins to snap
The longer the poems the stronger my bones
I'm on the desk as the writer
In my mental I would wet my diapers
Drinking from the bottle of Apollo
Writing the Gnostics between two cosmic tigers
I'm the Messiah, the solar facts, and the actual facts of rap
I'm 120 degrees, an abundance of cities and seas
And I’ll punish plenty MCs who try to run with my steez
My tongue is a gun and it’ll squeeze
I’ll burn sages, turn the pages, and I've heard these phrases

I can hear the angels talking in the background
I can walk on water
My wings can flap now
If I'm not here tomorrow
Light a candle and say a prayer
Close your eyes enter the Enterprise
I'm about to take you there

So what’s in the psychic world of Walter Reed?
With the Mic I see Isis
And my rhymes open up portals for the mortals to see the immortals
Gods, kings all calling for me
Talking, giving me ideas from Heavy Mental
To the portrait on The Offering CD
Oftenly
Negative thoughts cause distortion so I take caution when I lead
So look both ways before crossing my mind
Watch for signs
Stay along each of my lines
Place my rhyme envelope of quotes
In the inside pocket of the jacket of History
Over the long t-shirt of infinity
Which hides the heart of the city
I use both palms to shake the hands on the clock
Time stops, I make honey come from the rock
I took my rhyme buried it deep into the sands of time
Let the salt water nourish it
It won’t grow into a plant but something you can climb
First, it starts from a pebble, to a hill, to a mountain
Which will pour sweet waters down from its fountain
I am the biology of belief
Hip Hop is full of stars
I can read astrology of the streets
Psychology of the Priest
Deep as the philosophy of the Greeks
The prophecies from the East
My mind holds the forbidden science
When I’m writing
Can I get a witness when I’m rhyming?
Can I hear a Amen?
Been doing this before cavemen
Been doing this before the ancients of language
Look at somebody and say God is not dead
Just nod your head
Listen to the bars that I said
Words from the Matrix
My eyes are the spaceships
My mouth is the oasis
I zone on these phrases
I CAN HEAR THE ANGELS
But hold up
See why I look in the sky?
Inside of my soul is all the 12 tribes
And each of them channel in prayers to the Most High
Simultaneously and at different times
My right palm holds the strokes of one million scribes
Disguised as all twenty-seven bones inside
After my poem’s designed
Then I zone of the rhyme
In a black mist I exist
I spit and the sun was born
Using positive and negative protons and electrons
Rhymes were nuclear explosions
The atoms composing weak and strong
In one billionth of a second the galaxies were formed
Meteor showers, comet’s blast, loud and quiet storms
In my magnificent mind the problem was solved
Now let’s get creative
The rhyme is the data
And I heard these phrases

Look up into the heavens. What you see there is a vertical multitude
Of stars thrown across the empty spaces. Whereas the whole infinity
Of things might come down on us, how shall we not stand astonished
And abashed in seeing the immensity of heaven, and what
Greater still, that of a sovereign lord who made it? Chokma

Violins play, Rose petals fly in the wind
Mans bargaining with fallen angels but he dies in his sin
The world is in chaos, many try to pretend
I stop smoking weed now I get high off my pen
Grandma's alcoholic she might die off the gin
Devil smirks I grab a gun and blow off his grin

Thirsty youth in my hood just escape the gun blaze
No more church on Sundays, just wake on Mondays
He didn't value his life now six feet my son lay's

read the history on the black Messiah
Judges burning niggas and scorching their souls
When I walk I come across the fork in the road
Next to the black hawk on the pole
Hear the voice of the crow, when the wind blows
It gives me goose bumps and makes me tremble
Project temples with shattered windows
Street renaissance, thugs released on prison bonds
Become icons in gold chains and tote ions
Heart of the lion, hear the harps of Zion
Honey lips to sour words from bitter tongues
We live in slums, niggas pull the triggers on their guns
From day to night, the grave sight
Where snakes appear shed fake tears
Ghetto, seeds born with gray hair
Trying to escape from here it might take years
Priest modern day Shakespeare


I cut the world off from within the pain in my pen
Got me written scribe did my feather in blood
Niggas fuckin up so I remain cold inside
From the pain but I still strive
From my brothers slain in the street
Ordain in the ghetto and hang
Bang with the finest, steppin out of caskets
Or line us up kill for the kindness
The dimmest broads turn states evidence on small times
I use smoke L's like chimineys
, search for the remedy
Till my pain friendly fire let the devil in me
Every minute feels like infiniti
Time I trapped in it like enemy fire in the city
Of hope surrounded by dead energy, fallen Elohim who beam rocks
To bitches who sip Henney on the rocks
Who would kill me for pennies

Thee unconscious acts of the soul
Harness trapped in my conscious no parole
No control over the soul

'Cause like you I'm from the park and the benches
So what could I lose but make a conscious decision
'Cause I'm known to spaz
When I'm asked my remarks on this business
This game will do you in regardless of friendship
So excuse me when you reach for my palms

I'm telling my testimony to the Supreme above
Ain't I from thy genes?

Then there appeared a bright being, with white wings of a dove
It's lightning, people screamed and shoved
It's frightening, but I kept writing

And crucifixes, ruthless bitches

And getting corrupt, like Catholic church
And child nudity pictures

That's enough son!
That's enough!
Stop!
Nah...hold up...
Let me explain a second
I signed my first deal with Geffen records
I told them crackers ""I ain't no muthafuckin' Stepin Fetchit""
To my recollection, those bastards were like
""Cool, we'll drop you, have our A&R go find the next one""
I said ""I'll sue!""
They said ""That's alright, blackie
Take us to court!
And your lawyer Larry Studnickie? We been breaking him off""
I almost felt ruined
And in the midst of the confusion
They sent a muthafucking intern
Saying ""we don't understand his music
Now how the fuck we market this?
He's talking all that God-body and that prophet shit""
I said ""Damn! But it's still street!
It's real! Niggas can relate to it!""
In return they said, ""Priest throw that shit in the sewage""
Meanwhile, niggas like Nas and Kiss and Pun
Is telling me I'm nice
Down to G Rap to KRS One
And GZA told me all this shit would happen, just keep rappin'
I said ""that's peace, God, but I ain't muthafucking tapping""

Gang related, slang debated, nickel-plated
Pistol waving, he a apostille of Satan
Crystal is jaded, a fistful blazing
The secrecy keeps amazing
Secrets of my imaginations
Spinning animation, under the canvas, they're awaiting
My reawakening, still funny my girl's cheating on me
Bubbles in my stomach and one's sneaking on me
She's a freak, she's alone and she's horny
I fall asleep; I see a boner in orgies
Insecurities, impurities
React furiously, compulsive disorders
Witch torture, big Torah, Rosh Hashanah
Lit the menorah, God aura
I'm flying disc or saucer, over my head
With the crack, Ghetto Jezuz miracles
Turn rocks into bread, shots at the head
Duck it, got up, it's nothing
God gangsta, a rebel, I'm ready
For devils on all levels and pagans
I'm brazing sickles, amen, patient",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-let-us-pray-lyrics
"The Seer, the Poet", The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"[Intro: dialogues from 
The Twilight Zone
]
- You don't drink, do you?
- No
- Well, that's what killed my Jack. I told him it was the devil's work, but he wouldn't listen to me. And you can see where he is now
Oh, the devil's all around us, mister, all around us, everywhere we go. If we don't fight him, if we don't stand up to him, we suffer eternal torment
- Yeah, I'm sure you're right
- I know I'm right, and I'll tell you how i know. It was on a Sunday
I was ironing, if you please, and that's when it came out of a clear blue sky. Oh, the dear good Lord's own sweet breath and His voice like an electric shock- I was revelated! Oh, praise Him, mister, and praise his good works! Do you read the Book?
- What book is that?
- Why, the good Book!

As the night falls like black curtains all across diversions
Urban streets showered by a hundred curses
A man is murdered 
watching serpents now surface
Lurking through his denim purses
The birdhead chirpin'
, 
I zone-trip through seven universes
My chakras working while addicts purchase from the heroin merchants
Behind my screwed face is a gold pharaoh mask
Within my eye is an hourglass
Skin like brass, standing on unfinished corners
With bleekers on us, 
Lilith watches I watch her too
Through my telescope 'til this world envelopes
Inhale brimstone smoke, 
graphics from my canvas of hand scripts
My ink brush of luck if every sea was ink
If every tree was a pen you could see what I think
Would you do it again?
, 
my divine presence
My throne's not for threshin',
 
my mind's the weapon
Its essence is seven
,as soon as my poem begin
Make your bones cringe, 
amazing like the Stonehenge
Amun-Ra
Priest, the God

Right before I get in my zone, I sit on my throne
I write vivid hieroglyphics on stones through mystic microphones
Places where shadows were born, so carol my songs
The Pharaoh has called, so travel, come all
Right before I get in my zone, I sit on my throne
I write vivid hieroglyphics on stones through mystic microphones
Places where shadows were born, so carol my songs
The Pharaoh has called, so travel, come all
So travel, come all

The wings of Heaven is tied to the wings of the ghettos
Tries to soar but they're pulled by the strings of devils
Our claws get netted, then they pluck us, no justice
Our genetics, esoteric
, 
great grandmothers suffered, they cuss us
Then cuff us, we was accustomed, we precious
I pray like Adam the Giant in an Eden of lions
Flaming bodies in the horizon, way past Orion
There's a city arising with celestial princes, prophets and kings
From off every planet forming a solar regime
They say, ""Come brother, join us.""
But my time is not up so I lay in the cut
My voyage is not for many years, so while I'm still here
I spit that solar-fact rap
, 
that street kingpin
That tall man with green ski, feel me?
'Til then, and I see wings in my lens
I rep the hood, I love Apple Bottoms, 
stress is no good
It leads to that bridge over Gehenna
I rather see the earth greener
Disobedience led a curse between us
The mystic physics of Priest pictures in Kabbalistic Scriptures
Dissect the High Priest Rhymes
Of wardrobe of Coogi, the luggage of Louis
I lynched my gold neck, hung with jewelry
Beneath my hair cut, I wear a Kufi, feel me?

Right before I get in my zone, I sit on my throne
I write vivid hieroglyphics on stones through mystic microphones
Places where shadows were born, so carol my songs
The Pharaoh has called, so travel, come all
Come all, so travel, come all",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-seer-the-poet-lyrics

Me and my nigga - what!?

The emperor, chief sinister, street minister
Guarenteed in two bars to finish ya
React like a cat when he arches back
Give a fake rapper a heart attack, once I start to rap
I'm a vocalist, nigga, supposed to rip
Last Poet's told me this, hit ya in ya head wit my explosive fist
Then I finish ya off with my tremendous horse-kick
What now, nigga? Look at ya, talk shit
Can't do it, cuz you ain't got no teeth in ya mouth
And I know ya just tired of me, beatin ya out
Ya trained all year, in a karate class
It took one second, to put yo' ass in a body bag
From a shotty blast, I walk up in ya club and ya parties don't last
I like to pop shit, don't get me started
I slap y'all motherfuckers like y'all little kids in kindergarten
Squeeze yo' head till yo' kidneys harden
Now watch this, I'mma call my whole motherfuckin squadron
And tell niggas to just start robbin
Cuz y'all niggas is fucked up
And Brooklyn niggas is really ready to get ya
I know how to hit ya, and cut ya open
But don't worry, cuz I'mma stitch ya, with a rusty screwdriver

Niggas bop yo' heads to this, real shit
Call up yo' clicks to this, it's realness
You feel this in yo' streets and village
Spare that new shit, Priest killed it

Call up yo' clicks to this, it's realness
You feel this in yo' streets and village
Spare that new shit, 'bus killed it

Yo, yo, yo
Yo I'm a Macabeast MC and I possess the ability
To run at top speed without bendin my knees

Then, hurl niggas thousands of miles an hour, towards it
Fuckin heathen, wrap my hands around ya neck region
Then I start squeezin 'til ya stop breathin
You weaklins is playin tug-of-war wit ya tongues
I knock the teeth out ya gums and suck the breeze out ya lungs
Hit ya wit a blow your physical frame could never sustain
You'll probably never walk ever again
Nigga, you think you rhyme sick? I leave you lyin stiff
Put you in a horsemen heimlich til I break ya spine, bitch
Stop cryin bitch, before I hit ya wit the Iron, bitch
You can't rhyme bitch, the one triple nine's mine bitch
The pain'll make ya voice change octaves
From low-pitched to high-pitched, every hour we kill a hostage
We judge MC's by they lyrical fitness
And punish DJ's for puttin corny stickers on they mixes
Smack the stripper bitches for askin for our autograph and pictures
You'll be scared to leave the club wit us
You scratch my back, I'll scratch your's bitch
I'll eat ya salt-fish, if ya suck my sausage
I got an atomic sub, armed wit a sub-atomic scud
Ready to spill ya crimson-colored blood
The four horsemen on the back of four quadripeds
Puttin four hoof prints on ya foreheads, motherfuckers!
(There it is!) So bop ya heads to that, uh (There it is!)


Fuckin pussy emcee's, gon' get a shot in the eye

Never Existed,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"Stop playing man, fo'real man
What about that rhyme Killah Priest....
I told you son, there was never a Killah Priest
There was never 'A View From Masada', there was never a 'Priesthood'
There was never nobody that kick lyrics like that son
Fo'real, y'all niggas' is buggin'
Fo'real, I'm serious son, there was never a Killah Priest

He never existed; he was part of RZA's experiment
He was only in their imagination
Part of RZA and GZA's conversation
There was never an album called 'Heavy Mental'
That was only in y'all mental
Last song, you think somebody can make somethin' that strong?
That was didgeridoo instrumental, now hold on
I'mma show you why that nigga never exist
And why this cat never spit
Killah Priest the idea came from early Egypt
I'm talkin' way back on the other side of the map
Egypt was really called Mizraim
Name came from Noah's eldest son, his name was Ham
They told stories, relaxin' their thoughts
As their brain hovers New York
That third eye glide with views like a Hawk
Notice Hawk - Falcon, same thing
These was practiced by their Kings
Then Killah Priest came from B.C
That started wit the Sheikhs
They had Killah's that would teach
Noticed how they spelled Killah
K I L L A H, take the A, L L, add another A in the H
That's Allah; you see where I'm goin' God
And Priest was also in Egypt
See, don't take everything literally, peep it
Yo, flamin' arrows aimin' at Pharaohs' inhabitation
Racin' like a sparrow through a narrow population
Keyword: 'Pharaoh', they left codes back then
So their name would last on the globe, when it spins
He said: ""Pharaoh, of the big apple""
Lettin' you know, another code
I judge wisely between two pillars of ivory
Why two pillars?
Look that's Greeks takin' from the Egyptians again my nigga
See Killah Priest never died because Killah Priest never was alive
Notice how other rappers never talk about him
Even in his own clique, cuz he's just a clone kid
They say he use to talk to this girl from Roc-A-Fella (Amil)
Well, why they never drop nothin' together
They say she had a baby by him, but where's that?
I'm waitin' Black, look the Sunz of Man album cover 'Saviorz Day'
Where he at? Look man, I'm just kickin' facts
He don't be wit no Wu-Tang
Maybe I'll sit back and let you explain
They said GZA discovered
I checked GZA's latest album, Priest ain't on none of them
Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth (B.I.B.L.E.)
That's GZA's song, PROVE ME WRONG!?!
He was never a Gravedigga
Killah Priest was made up by RZA son
(Outro)
Word, shit, fo'real son?
Wait a min, hold on, that shit is crazy son
Wait a min, hold on, what about him & Canibus battling?
But nobody else was there, just him & Canibus?
Forreal?
Yo son I'm trying to tell you that was Canibus rhyme
Killah Priest was never there, son they made all that shit up
Why the Horsemen never drop? I'm tellin' you son
Cuz they don't wanna expose that to everybody
And let everybody know that they be just makin' Killah Priest
That dude Walter Reed he mad funny, he don't spit ...
He don't spit it like that man, he's a cool guy man
Fo'real, nice dude, he's really funny too
He's my man, word! But um yo son I'm tellin' you man
That Killah Priest concept that genius tho, I like that
Yo RZA, you get all the props in the world for that man
You get all the props in the world
Yo y'all Wu-Tang niggas I love y'all man
How they gon' make up somebody like that, that ill son
They created that, fo'real, yo y'all was magnificent man
Sunz of Man and puttin' all that, hahaha
I got it now, oh I got it, it was part of...OH!!
So if they do that then nobody had to come against them
Cuz... oh I got it, I got it, I got it
So whadup wit Dreddy Kruger?
Wanna hear about that, oh that's part 2

Tower (The Visitor), The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Verse I
Behold from Nibiru
The 900 souls of a pharaoh
Speaking through my lips to the ghetto
Hello
Shalom salaam
From the Om beyond
Alone from the eons
Now devil be gone
I come to talk to your presidents
Why do you have aerial defense?
I have evidence
Global dragnet space system
The World Wide Web
From Egyptians listen, vision
I talk from The Emerald Tablets from Thoth
Just rapping my thoughts
Inhabitants of the world with gravitational force
From the cabinets of Nazareth
I gathered this
Astro-theology versus Castro’s philosophies
Knowledge, eyes to see
In my afro’s astrology
The Leo, Virgo, emerge souls
Libra, the ether it gets deeper
In Scorpio, Horus shows Judas
Seems foolish?
Did Christ feed a multitude with two fish?
Pisces, I write these
Crown of thorns the sun to rule us
Before they bury us, Sagittarius, the mass of gas over areas
Capricorn, in the blackness it was formed
The Aries, Aquarius, squares in the circles fit
Virtue off my lip I spit mucus
Showing you that the future exists
(Hook)
Look through my eyes
Become solar energized
Higher powers
I am the tower travel inside
The head of the Sphinx is a woman
The body’s a lion
Transform
He who stands godly vs science
(Repeat)
Verse II
Greetings earthlings
Where herbs spring
Which dirt brings
Where birds sing
And chirp with perched wings
Deny god, prefer kings
Even England serves Queens
So how y’all searching?
To every person, man or a woman nursing
Ultimate light
The solstice bright
Focus the sight
Plague of locust from my mic
Washing my chakras
Cleansing my aura
Transcending from water
Beginnings of Torahs
The cube within the cube
The wise can pretend as a fool
But the fool cannot contend with the wise
Most High, multi-skies
Solar energize spectrums over Nephilims
Crop circle makers
Planets, strange craters
It’s just human nature
Shooting lasers sky fireworks
I’ll take you to a higher verse
This is for the babies that died at birth
What’s life worth?

The Egyptian

HOREMHEB: Are you trying to tell me that you'll fight against me?
SINUHE: Oh, you will win that, too. For if you fail to silence me, you know what I will do
HOREMHEB: What will you do, physician?
SINUHE: I will go among the people, and try to answer the questions that burden their hearts. The questions that I have asked myself all my life, wherever I've wandered in the world, and which were answered for me by a dying man (e.g. Akhnaten). I will wear the clothes of a slave, and kick the sandals from my feet, and speak to the wives as they fry their fish before their mud-huts by the river; to the porters on the docks; to the smiths by their bellows; to the slaves under their yokes.

Born to be immortal face buried in mountains of coke
We sail 100 winters, Black Fridays and 12 storms
The wind hurls on through heron(heroin) we bare arms
The beast is updated, no ancient Babylon just a computer that skeets lasers, a freak of nature stole our peace replaced our street
With gangsters no longer 666
Its 9 digits, mind physics, defined eurythmics, scene fiction
Psycho glyphics
The news is now Youtube, every eye glued survival statans the God of the new bible, the lake of fire revivals, graven idols, Obamas Moses, a red sea of refugee solders, the crucifixion of the old Jehovah that blew out millenniums and rolled Jeeps over, The skys beige today the color of that dead mans skin is grey, breathe life in em, stand up come out of them graves the young hood daughters that that hold the kings forbes keep turning stay in your orbit, they like the diamonds, anklets, baguettes reflect, but its Yah light thats truly shining

Golden Pineapple Of The Sun,Planet of the Gods,2015,"VERSE I
Hip hop's been altered
Since the Psychic World Of Walter
Now it stands like the Rock of Gibraltar
Hood clips footage of flying saucers
Magi rabbis close the Torah
Fallen angels disguise themselves as planets
Reprogramming from ape man to kings riding a mammoth
Moldavite falling from the heights like it's manna
I heard once you can't serve both God and Mammon
And it all happens on the 3rd rock
Sunspots, graveyards and gunshots
Space gods the ones watch
Nazis flee to the moon, build empires and a space fleet
To return to earth to take police
Camouflage avatars
Mutagen agents
Chasing
Leaving unknown lubricant trails inside the staircases
After two thou hit
Prepare for foulness
Space gear with gods striking our planet with battleships
The stone pharaoh splits
And nuclear lightning left the castle chipped
Left the casles chip light your candlesticks
VERSE II
The CIA plan to murder the evil galactic dictator
Over big paper
Rich gangsters
Diamond traders
Smuggled into the city of the skyscrapers
E pluribus unum is the one-eyed saviour
They massacred millions of African children
Trafficking women
Assassins for emblems
Psychiatric advisers interview the survivors
Books and schools prove to be liars
Crooks rule they move on messiahs
Help gather the unwanted beings
From all the kings in his control
Transport them to this globe (earth)
Beings stacked around the base of volcanoes
While preachers and drug users claim to see the face of angels
Just stuck looking up for months in the same clothes
Memory editing from medicines
Virtue worlds from the heroin
Hold on we just got here let us settle in
Inside the moon is a night club
With trillion watt light bulbs
A green woman took us in and showed us nice drugs
Parents of a young genius killed in a plane crash
We all kneeled before the faces in stainless
Two armies charge and disappear into each other
And where they disappeared a UFO hovers
The god holds the mic
No two MCs flow alike
And no two stones are sodalite
(golden pineapples of the sun
King of the amethyst catacombs
If another ice age grips the earth
Prepare ourselves to fly home)
VERSE III
We went from reading the future in the cosmos
To computer consoles
To every human in a household
Having to have a barcode
Make me wanna leave the condo
And flee back to the Congo
The great Sphinx head of Giza originally portrayed Anubis
The heads of Saint John, Paul and Peter
Under the feet of Seleucus
Then Jesus betrayed by Judas
Then Caesar betrayed by Brutus
Only drink tea when it's made by buddhists
But nowadays teachers betrayed by their students
Drug kingpins are sprayed up by their ruins
In the first modification
Of the god races
Left scars on faces
Spoke through a storm using Mars language

Is an angelic dialog

Lord Marduk, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Yeah, Killah Priest the Iron Sheik
Moon Cricket, yeah, like I said
There is no beginning no ending to this rhyme
This Kingdom Rap

When I brainstorm, power outing
Flash light flickers, showers cells, devour the trails
Like thunder I’m under the spell
Rain dance, thoughts splash take a glance
I’m in a trance, note words across my pad
Until the meteorite ignite, strike the paper
Then I write over some human nature
Zigzag lightning, frightening, white wings
Left hemisphere of the brain, through my thought glass
See the forecast, try to explain, the weather man
With letters I can do anything I want
Put together interviews, it becomes cloudy
Then I can’t see the boundaries
The rain drops of these ink blots
Won’t stop till I paint art
Of thunder rolls into a scroll

The first chapter. Number 1
Number 2. There’s no beginning no end. Alright

Ancient villages, lived a man of Gilgamesh
Pre-dates the pyramids, wrote from clay cylinders
Deeper than Homer and The Iliad, Enkidu
Welcome to the wise man and the idiot
Before synagogues, before incense and mosques
There were Demigods, men from stars
Sent from the wonderland of Oz
Nebuchadnezzar, Nimrod, built towers of Ur
Been heard Aristotle blunted the herbs
""Let there be light"" God under those words
From Atom to Adam to Atum, life begin in the womb
The cradle, the casket, the crater
To other planets, the Sun and the moon
From Neanderthals to cannonballs
To Moses stood on the rock
The burning bush, returning to Kush
From worlds now and worlds to come
Not found in no books, no hook
Seven Tablets of Creation

The black king sits, wearing a hat with the wing disk
Ashes from the Phoenix, Supreme Genius
Saw myself in a million dreams killing Philistines
Brilliant King, Brazilian Queen on my arm
Y'all catch fire, liars like Cilvaringz
Forgive me but this is napalm
Call me Marduk from Stardust
A new attribute according to my Pharaoh suits
Priest celestial counterparts, removes his ship
This is it, the zoo from the cliff

Mercilless
This is Gebu sight chess boxing, your move
Yeah, Rhyme theory

We’re under power movements
Dominant on continents
Hard like a stiff ya nigga
Soft like an impotent
Magnificent, blackness, your high excellence
Got mad power, so keep your dead presidents
The highest level, pray to Imhotep epoch soul rebel
Tamed men Tasmanian devils
What better, to be a wise man or a fool?
I’m wise, but I can play the role of a fool
Fuck school, unless you learn the lessons of life
Don’t piss against the window, fuck your friends wife
On a roll like dice, I poker before twice
Ya never saw me or sold for a small price
General Idi Amin Dada
I kill traitors, close your mouth, level lever
Blood diamonds cause violence, code of silence
We need international African alliance
To make life more better, with more cheddar
Times are getting redder, and I’m a go getter
So where the loot, cave dweller, with Ogallala
My fist sniffs your beats and your a capellas
Amazing like grace, my sweet sounds embrace
By the millions and millions from my race
The new deadly doers, so now you know lugging
I slug Batman, yo Priest come robin

I am the Angel Gabriel, with my brother Michael

A portrait of a killer known of formerly as a priest
Ceremony ceased tabernacle released
700 jackals loose in the streets
The ashes of his enemies blow under his feet
Thunder and sleet blow doors open, in the cathedral
The candles go out-the portrait open his mouth-spit
Apocalypse, dark mist drift past MCs with blood on their head
Sworn for the dead, spread the skies out like an endless table cloth
Chop ya legs both off, stable you in the navel with a pitchfork
This is witch talk-warlock rhymes with boss hog grimes
Snatch outcha mind-put it at the end of ya spine
Brush ya teeth with my nine-who wanna battle
Let’s take a raffle
I’ll meet you with a scalpel, slice ya Adam’s apple
Never disturb the dead-ya bones are spread
Poems are said, Ouija board spells out
Priest Of War, you’ll be eaten by my sword
The man unfinished I throw you in god’s prison
You do a sentence of repentance
There’s no remembrance of forgiveness, my torture’s endless
Inches for inches, I’m relentless
I go into heaven, kick the gates in
Fight angels-get you to shake
Drag ya ass out by ya halo up that street paved with gold
Then I throw yo ass back to the globe
See I own ya soul, you go to hell
I fight against bats just to get you  back
I wrestle devils, run through fire
Kill demons just to finish ya beatin’
While ya friends still grievin’
I’m worse than death, I’m worse than pain
My lyrics kill again and again
Liliths kiss you, take you to the cave near the red sea
Where the skeleton remains of the dead MCs
Ya flesh leave depression proceeds
Walk down my stairs of echo, within my ring of Texas chainsaws
You came as war, came with the devil
Leviathan fiery breath breathed upon you
The planet’s my footstool
The king of Gog and Magog, the great grandsons of Nimrod
Sacrifice his limbs to my god
When they buried Medusa she left a graveyard full of statues
Which rap would you choose?
Which axe shall I use?
Witch hunt the devil asked for you
Tie you to a stake
Like Joan of Arc-these forms of art
Of galleries are different ways of ya casualties
You die violently!
I write with a violent pen
Someone like I’m tattin’ ya skin
When I spit the entire Vatican cringe
I’m back for you again
Let the bats ascendI come from hell’s wide mouth

Eternal Thoughts,The Eternal Thought of Killah Priest (Bootleg),2009,"(Intro)
What happened here officer?
Detectives have seen a dead body on the floor
I got this
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
There was a man there... there was a man there
-
A young man solves a murder case
By touching the bodies of victims
Put his hair to the dead mouths to listen
A woman wakes up in a bed screaming
'Cause her ovaries are missing
She's paralyzed, then the warm lights glisten
A man lifts up a truck to save his son
Another visits his son in the grave over a gun
A family attends the graduation; the other family visits a prison
Caught up in the system, or you rise to prism
Childbirth to ploughing dirt
From a smile to a smirk to a frown, now we hurt
Everything in the ground of the Earth
To billions of planets and elements found in the Universe
The question – the answer – the problem – the solver
The puzzle – the single – the couples
Life and death to life after death
To resurrect this mic I adjust
The sermon – the prayer – the ritual
We all prepare...
The Church – the Mosque – the Temple to the school
The mystery is the future, it's the history
The failure to his victory",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-eternal-thoughts-lyrics
Covenant,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"26 million worlds that exist
27 trillion worlds that come within the words of my tongue
Also the Book of Life and Book of Death
A heart shape like the world map that beats on my chest
My eyes are planets twirlin' in my mind is gigantic
Mental aneurysm, comets, astroids invaded my system
Satellite camera vision, smart clouds hover my wisdom
You still wanna battle a God? My empower less stars
King of Cups, you can see me in the tarot of cards
So lay down your prayer rugs
Confess your sins and bow in the Mosque
It's the Dalai Lama in Armani armor
Between two towers that's lodged
Follow the Wao like the Buddhist Tao
Teach peace or transform the Priest, the ruthless Angel
So what you want huh - horns or halo?
The man wit the goat head or the law from Gabr-el
I don't need a record label
All I need is a mic and a hi-tech cable
So I can hook it up to satellites
Now y'all can see what Heaven is like
To make seven thousand trillion elements a night
Call it the greatest our day the lessons at night
Then form the Earth within that, my pen tap, my lens snaps
Then I go black, then form two more greater lights
The one rules the day for all human life
(Hook)
Make way the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies
The Month of Tishri, The Day of Judgment
This is my covenant

Jesus of Nazareth, my hair grows like green asparagus
On the tallest cliff where my castle sit
I spit - atom split, your brain anatomy, the matter shift
Produce dopamines, serotonin, your endorphin's click
Every cell in my bodies lit, it's like lightning bugs
When I'm writin' it's like drugs
Benzocaine, light on Cain
Kills the pain when I'm writin' your brain
This rhyme's steroid, take it like an asteroid
Call me Elroy, my ink pad destroyed
Let's voyage; my fist's the foundation stone for my Mayan temples
Six millennium to finish this poem, infinite rap
Last Supper see me in the back eatin' snacks
I slapped the Devil on a Friday
Play lotto, a string of good luck and misfortune
Lost all my bread on a Sunday, I fasted at horse run
I bet 20 on red, lost all my cash in Blackjack
Now let me back track, drunk all the whiskey by nine
And Church by 11 and flirted wit the Preacher's daughter
Got in the panties by seven, Priest the astronaut
Psychopathic plots, gats and crack
Wardrobes for my pops, and that's hip-hop and you don't stop
(Hook)

Satan cast from Heaven, where's the mass of Nephilim's?
The Phoenix rise from the ash and caused the spectrum
Walk in spacecraft call me deaf Tron
Gucci Specs on, Louis painted on my teflon
Y'all respect the Don
Decepticon will shoot lasers from an electric palms
Psychedelic, methadone, in the form of a CD-rom
The flyest street we're on, my back is as big as King Kong
Drink ginseng tea wit Buddha
While me and Muhammad (pbuh) discuss the Qur'an
My words combine wit air elements and make sputa
Rubbin' my third eye when I'm pistol tappin' my medulla
Eatin' figs wit the Rabbi's - goin' over the Torah
Lightin' my Nora's, writin' in water's
Send kosher prayers up to God
Yom Kippur - Rosh Hashanah - Catholic practice
Let the tomato's roast on the pasta
Take a communion wit the guns usin'
Tappin' the Bible, chapter AK verse 47
The book of act, street survival
Drinkin' yac's in the back of revivals
Gimme back my title, number one universe disciple

News from the East, Priesthood has returned
Yeah huh 'bout to get dark Priesthood yea huh yeah yo

World place your eyes on the God at hand
The Warrior, the Emperor, I declare I am
Number one, disagree then y'all R.I.P
As far as I see, the sun only outshines me
Bring your posse your crews your clique your gang
Only takes two to get it y'all spit the same
Say my name — Priest now say it again — Priest
Say to him — Priest, say it to them — Priest
Watch him he's like the new Rakim
On everybody's favorite rapper list I view top ten
I keep boxing I'm a fighter, one of the best writers
I came from Brooklyn with that Bed-Stuy fire
That Brownsville flow
Pounds of 'dro my crown my robe
Who's the greatest king? Now y'all know
Surround by souls that may be from the Dark Ages
They tell me things right before I dart my pages
My art's contagious like skills from parts of Asia
God like paper found on my desktop
Y'all searching for the best well the best just drop it's

Priesthood - the world right in my palms
Priesthood - the projects is my coat of arms
Priesthood - let it be known the lead will be flown
Priesthood - New York's my castle, my house, my throne

It's Priest Ban YaHa WahDa Wum YaHa WaSHI
Say my name watch a hundred cowards die
Fitted head wraps Mediterranean cat
Owl tattoos I carry Albanian gats
The Pharaoh of the Big Apple since Big had you
Since the planes took our twin castles
Gem statues with ten bathrooms
Send Pterodactyls like a sorcerer
You swallow my jewels now cough it up; of course it's us
Priest and the nemesis true lyricist
Y'all started but I'ma finish it
Lyrical shit Priesthood guns like Clint Eastwood
Streets to hood, I been eating good
I brain storm till the ink on my paper change forms
To black clouds and dark spells that I bring on
I'm having constant dreams that I'm Constantine
Wake up guided by angels with armored wings it's

Priesthood - the world right in my palms
Priesthood - the projects is my coat of arms
Priesthood - let it be known the lead will be flown
Priesthood - New York's my castle, my house, my throne

I greeted you all with open arms
And what y'all do y'all grab y'all ratchets and open arms
Kept firing to eventually my ghost is gone
Till I'm lying down and it's my blood I'm chocking on
But my hope's too strong my oaths are real know thy will
That's why this whole sky filled with black birds
""Globe stop"" spinning backwards
My last words are heard like it was the first
The gift and the curse greet y'all and switch in reverse
I greeted you all then open arms watch y'all tumble and fall
Throw up both of your arms in the pool hall

Priesthood - the world right in my palms
Priesthood - the projects is my coat of arms
Priesthood - let it be known the lead will be flown
Priesthood - New York's my castle, my house, my throne

Currents Of Events, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"8 o'clock, the door knocks
Black wakes up, grabs his Glock
Looks for his girl and his man Scott
Scott at the door with the nine cocked
His girl grabs the box, she tells him ""Meet me at the other spot""
Blows a kiss, hits the back window and hops
Black runs over toward Scott, ""How they figure our plot?""
Then far away, they both hear shots
Thoughts of his girl shook his world
He scream ""Cassandra!"" then dropped
The scenes just stopped, the camera pops

Earlier, 7:55, Scott's peeking through blinds
He sense a set up, so he reach for his nine
Looks at his man, Black, on the couch sleep
He's out deep, in the background this loudmouth freak
She's filing her nails, sucking her teeth
She saying ""Y'all should've followed me to my spot
Through the woods, it's right up the street""
He said ""I know"" then, and then they both paused
He said, ""Shh, I hear a car's pulling up near the door""
He called Black, he called him once, twice
But he didn't react, look at the clock
It struck 8 o'clock, then he heard a knock
Nine cocked at the door, Black calling his name
Heard something in the back, sounds strange
Heard the mumbles, box, fumble
He quickly look back, saw Black staring out a window
What the fuck, Black runs over asks him ""How they figure the plot?""
Then they both heard shots, Black face stood up, he screamed and just dropped
Scott opened up the door firing shots said ""Fuck it"", shot in the leg
The scene just stopped, the camera pops

Earlier, up early, 7:30, mad worry
She's thinking, thoughts sinking
About her in cuffs in the precinct
All because of that box, she kept a good watch
On the door and the lock
Her man that she met not too long ago named Black is out on the couch
They all in the house, the toilet flush, Scott comes out, the bathroom
She said ""Excuse me"", he's mad rude, G
He gave her the quiet side, took out his nine
She said, ""What the hell, you keep acting nervous, oh well""
Took out a nail filer, and start filing her nails
She heard a knock, then Black called her name
Her filer had dropped, she grabbed the box
She said, ""Meet me at the other spot, love you""
Jumped out the window, into the cold
She's running in fear, then she hears ""Freeze!""
She slip, falls, drops to her knees, gets up runs
The police shoots, in hot pursuit
Running through the woods, trying to make it to a stoupe
Then she hears a couple of shots
Coming from the house she's just escaped back a couple of blocks
Then she finally makes it to her spot
Along with the box
The scene just stops, the camera pops

The time, 8:15, ahead
Scott's bleeding from his leg
Black is on his knees in a daze
Police raid
He said ""I don't wanna be this way
I don't wanna live without my whiz'""
Put he Glock to his wig, then pulled the trigger
Cops surround the body of a stupid nigga

Two weeks prior, Cassandra's in police uniforms in the line of fire
Acting coach, wearing wires, FBI showing pictures of one Michael AKA Black Washington
And one Scott Peterson, and how she should meet with them
While eating out with the co-workers
She didn't notice Scott staring at her while she was ordering burgers
She didn't notice Scott always alert with the burner
She didn't notice that he soon will have her murdered
I guess at the time it didn't concern her
Now rewind this song, see if this picture is perfect",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-currents-of-events-lyrics
Street Thesis, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"The artistry night settles down over Montego Bay
The hustlers and ballplayers come in to play
Lifestyles give a grand view as Pan Am flew
Some nest down from the iron wings of Jet Blue
Dress shoes beach front penthouse, pimped out villas
For fly niggas, quiet killers
Millennium condominiums with wide pillars
The finest community’s resorts for golf, digital room keys
Luxury spas for broads, shopping, dining
The beach chair with the mayor reclining
A clear atmosphere, see the planets aligning, shining
Dive in the turquoise water, during sun-time
During the moon skyline the stars reflect like quarters
Then it’s casinos, poker the gamblers come out
But on the other side its soldiers, the hammers dump out
They shoot up corners, five Gs stashed for the lawyers
In case someone saw ya’ amongst the snake-talkers
The night walkers the native New Yorkers
All the way across the borders, we hit the streets like savages
Start apartheid like the Africans
M-16 with banana clips
The streets made us like this, I told my psycho-analyst
Can’t handle it

Better than a young man’s knowledge is an old man’s experience
Skin tatted up, my mind is luxurious
Though I stumble I rise, seven times stronger
More thorough in the mind, street thesis

We all in prison, none of us free
Shop in the richest neighborhood, it’s still government cheese
Shove ‘em and squeeze, gut ‘em and leave, blood on their sleeve
Cut ‘em with these, roll ‘em in a rug under trees
Mob dude laughing, cartel assassins
Fucking guy, I use a barbell to bash ‘em
Democrats and the fascists, nukes pointed at the continent
Armed defense board of education decaying
Bombs commence attacks in Iraq, sign of the times
Money over mind soldiers in the line, Jehovah or the wine?
The news takes over the tube, face confused
This place is a zoo, meanwhile at Mr. Chow’s
Sitting down with black cards and fast cars are rap stars
That attracts y’all, if we don’t tell the truth to the youth
About their roots what they planned for you
We deserve the punishment due

Better than a young man’s knowledge is an old man’s experience
Skin tatted up, my mind is luxurious
Though I stumble I rise, seven times stronger
More thorough in the mind, street thesis

How I stay afloat as the GOAT, the rap game needed a pulse
Y’all beat it to pulps, what I seen was a bulb
Above my skull, I took the oath
Expose y’alls team as a hoax, what I seen was a joke
I went in the vaults
The murder I wrote never heard my approach
Silence will I kill the giant? I’m still a lion
With the courage to give y’all the street coverage
Heat busting, flights with the Louis V. luggage
‘Till police cuff ‘em coming through customs
Slug ‘em or they drug ‘em
Bullets through his chest or his stomach
Death is sudden coming from the east, north, west and southern
Streets is stubborn you cheated, you fronted
The priest is governed by higher forces, maybe flying sources
From another orbit or they hide in waters
Found by scientists when I’m rhyming I am Hiram Abiff
My lines are the bricks

Better than a young man’s knowledge is an old man’s experience
Skin tatted up, my mind is luxurious
Though I stumble I rise, seven times stronger

Y'know I'm sayin'
I C U When I Get There

We came a long way from ducking strays
My niggas laid in the alley ways
Funerals were made, by the beauties sprayed
But now I'm different, somethin new today
I'm seein bright tunnels, bein my life crumbled before
Now I'm restored I wanna see more
Wanna explore, standin by the ocean shore
It looks like heaven just opened it's doors, shinin on me
I'm like a diamond homey (yeah), yo...
So many eulogies we heard, usually leads to the urb'
To ease the nerve, but I believe in readin the word
Taking heed from the man that's feedin the birds
The broaden my horizon, it's hard survivin
I'm job applyin, I keep strivin, I keep tryin
I'm tryin to turn defeat to Triumph
There's no place in this jungle for weak lions
Politicians and preachers, they keep lyin
And the streets supplyin, how many times do I have to heat the iron?
Every night there's a gunfight
Fuck misery, I wanna see sunlight
I wanna know at the end that my son's all right
Yo, and to all my fallen soldiers, that's no longer here
I C U When I Get There
I reminisce on the R. Kelly I Wish
Yo, right now I'm writin the remix
Y'all heard the stories of the miseries
Rivals between enemies, there's no love or no sympathy
Y'all heard the stories of the stress, death through debts
Project sex and welfare cheques, with Tecs
Automatics, y'all saw the graphics
Well, I know y'all had enough of that shit
I wanna see thrones, I want a land of my own
I want a zone, finally found my way back home
Sit back and relax, readin my poems
While the sunlight hit and gleam off the stones
It's only natural, I want castles and black jewel
I want statues and marble floors
That's what I have toppers for
Open up Solomon doors
Surrounded by priests, scholars and moors
Say my name, dollars just pour
Not that fake paper money
But the coins that they take from mummies
Everybody in my world 'bout the age of 20
Smell a rose, taste the honey, no achin tummies
I could write about my miserable life, critical nights
Fought physical in the spiritual fight
Israelite, mystical type, like a Hindu in white
Let me tell you what my visuals like
Insights of a High Priest, mind's deep as the blue sea
Purple robe, brown Cuffie is all beauty
Absorb the ruby from yours truly, truly

Talking in tounge til the bitches go blind
Slow down baby, bout to lose yo mind
Now, I lick on breasts, the honeys impressed
Talk about sex til we both undressed
Til she's in bed, tryna put me to the test
Then I beat upon that flesh to put her ass to rest
I can, go for hours, control my power
This position is called the lotus flower
Now the chick is strung, like the way that I'm hung
Cause I could drive it like a slave all the way to her lungs
Aaaaahhh


Hold up ladies, lemme tell y'all one thing
G strings and I like that tongue ring
You really freaky, come over and freak me
Get on top, you all hot and leaky
Oh you need me, know how to please me
You just like the way the ring is on the pinky
Calling me daddy, talkin all trashy
I'm into that fatty, bring that wagweed
I pulled that hair, put that there
Put those up there, lets use that chair
Bring those fruits out, I got ideas
Belly to belly, hands cuffed under that jelly
Split that muff and disrupt the tele

Til Thee Angels Come (For Us),The Offering,2007.0,"Bad person, in the underworld
The bad persons are the bad egg
A bad news, a bastard, a black sheep, the black god
All the vagabonds, thieves, the bums, the mask of the cowards
Villains, the criminals, the scoundrels, robbers, the racketeerers
The Angel said...

Look at the killers, dealers, scramblers, hustlers, pimp
Tho lives are running, police coming, gunning, jumping over fences
Hide in trenches, fight, defenses, ducking bullets
This is that hood shit, show more footage, speak from pulpits
(Fellow Americans, you are now under a new era, A New World Order)
We're all the same as Angels, watching, ain't no stopping
Sky's crack, You lie back, watch, you're in, burning skin, turning in
Hell bound, hell hound, with scales down, 'til their tails ground
Chasing us, barking, we're darking, dropping revolvers in the apartments
Here comes the Marksmen up the stair case, I start busting backwards
Slipping, where is the Pastor? Too many distractions, 9/11
Signs from Heaven, find a weapon, AK, SK, HK's, MK
Mayday, mayday, mayday, rocket launchers, my project's bonkers
We sold drugs 'til it's over, it's time to close up
Yup, let's go, closure, judgement day, thugs will spray
Devil's is running, 'cause they'll realize something worse then Hell is coming
A black bird burning down until it turns to a fire breathing dragon

Look at the things we done, (OH MY, MY, MY)
We live like dangerous, (JUST DRY YOUR EYES)
Until the Angels come, (OH MY, MY, MY), for us

It seems like, a giant hologram of the President's head above my projects
Or the night crawling down like a Panther from a tree where the fog sets
Where you hear whisper out from the darkness, like we've survived
Yo, yo, come here, shorty, shorty, shorty, come here, come here
I got something here for you; Priest beloved, immortal
Travel through portals, behold the Pharaoh before you
I was once a radical poor dude that stood on the corner
Teaching blacks we're the Lost Jews
Why? 'Cause my people's were deprived of Yale and Law Schools
Now they walk around with a head full of lost screws
Never been into rabbit's foots or horse shoes
Or superstitions trying to make me lose my vision
Look up, the nukes are in position

Repute the system, our people are too conditioned
Too persistent, many will come, a few will listen
Razah, Priest, and Obadiah, a new dimension, chose your henchmen's
Crucial business, lunaticing 'til the roots of lineage

Look at the things we done, (OH MY, MY, MY)
We live like dangerous, (JUST DRY YOUR EYES)
Until the Angels come, (OH MY, MY, MY), for us
[Verse 3: Hell Razah & 
Kilah Priest
]
We're surrounded by... Births, abortions, churches, organs
Don't bury me; these Romans will only dig up my coffin
We was orphans who was born into wars and slave auctions
(KKK) Better pray for the day they burnt them crosses
We're the spooks who threw them torches up inside the Bush's office
Wicked forces, Kissed their daughters and sons
And take precaution, now the Priest released this Offering
Renaissance, we're born again, my pen drip the ink for the sinks
Blood of the Sphinx, kissed my eye, wool on his head
While I feed him unleavened bread
Point the infrared on enemies who wish to see me dead
The Pope opened up and read... ""Revelations"" Then he blared:
""I met an Angel"" and he said To drop the gun that's on my leg
I rolled up out of my bed, walked on synagogue floors
My house, Cathedrals, ceilings with Egyptian walls
My diner room, Last Supper style, twelve chairs with King Tut cuts
Cave bathrooms and medieval towels

Look at the things we done, (OH MY, MY, MY)
We live like dangerous, (JUST DRY YOUR EYES)
Until the Angels come, (OH MY, MY, MY), for us

Ha, ha, ha, ha, where are you're going? You ain't going nowhere
Bring your asses to me, you're coming with me tonight
Ha, ha, ha, ha, you're coming with me
1And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit
And a great chain in his hand. 2And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent
Which is called the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 3And cast him into
The bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive
The nations no more, till the end of a thousand years be fulfilled: (Rev. 20:1–3 KJV)
Ha, ha, so where do you think you're going nigga? Where do you think you're going nigga?
Where do you think you're running to nigga? You're coming with me, all your asses are coming with me
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I own you, I own you for a thousand years, Till The Angels Come
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you rappers, you sold your fucking life for over to me you bastards
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, This is the stroll for the apocalypse, you bastards

What y'all niggas want? Go get your set
Make y'all pussies run, Load up my Tek
Attack like lions, Go straight at the neck
Hyena niggas down, My paws on they chest
Show you canines before we tear in your flesh
Breathing down your face son, I can taste your death
I know you're scared now, nigga, I see the sweat
Razor sharp teeth, come close like Gillette
I return like the Prodigal Son, Y'all can rest
The arguing's done, rappers scared
They marveled I've come
Problem One; I can see why I'm startling some
Because I come in peace but my apostles have guns
Son of Man, in his glory with revolvers to lungs
Now stand still witness the god while I rob you for funds
I must say, Priest spits with a remarkable tongue
Now let's us see what deep flows the Masada has brung
Right before I get in my zone, I sit in my throne
Then I lounge, one foot pivot while I'm spitting my poems
My poetry so vivid it was written in stone
They say Priest is some sort of mystic
He speaks wisdom unknown
I'm the poet blindfolded my queen's palms cover my ears
So when I wrote this intuition was there
My brain's a replica of Mecca
My mind holds the secrets to Egypt
But however I stay on some street shit
I write the scrolls on a hundred skulls
My cunning flow is stunning
It's like you're blunted, has you under control
Mumbling to yourself while I'm confronting your soul
Priest, the deity meant to crumble the globe
Behold a flow out of this world
Throwing dollars at girls sliding on poles
To diamonds and pearls
Aligning of the stars Priest be Osiris rhyming
My eylids marked around with black chalk
Like Nas on his album cover I Am...
Like Malcolm my brothers, let's take a stand
Teachers, teacher and the angel came forth holding the scroll
Given the offering tell us more he said
I write street archives with deep dark eyes
My meek heart cries
When I see the murders beneath god's skies
I record and lose the disk but we keep hard drives
Ask Dreddy after the flow
Show you where bodies are buried
Worries cover the face of Reverend Jesse
Just hold steady
I'm 'bout to drop something old but heavy, ready?
Before this rap all I knew was wrapping up grams
Only tracks I knew was on the arms of Sam
Nigga arm was like a pin cushion
Y'all just starting but I been Brooklyn
Central Booking '91 in the pen with hoodlums
I sit still like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Which pen should I grab?
My rhymes is like its portal
I can see in the past
Some say I'm immortal dark skin with a staff

It's time

I'm tied up in the basement, blindfolded by nine soldiers
With rare paintings and fine sculptures
They spoke blatant, their nine's loaded
They put a gat to the back of the blind poet
I want to cry but I try and hold it, one of them notice
Crack me over the skull with a crime motive
They made a toast to my death, I rose to my feet
With the heat close to my flesh
May I say these last words to my enemies passing the Earth?
Laughing at my passion and merge, ""Ok, kill me if y'all wanna""
Slay me and never play the corner, cold winters
You're all goners, tell your mamma call the coroners
You get me, and God gets you, it makes sense, don't it?
In the heat of the moment

In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal

After the sunshine there's rain, after the laughter there's pain
After my chapter there's flames
After the rapture the master shall reign
Shockwaves blacken the terrain, and man looks strange
Open the book, see I'm king, read my name, and see thy wings
Believe I changed, I went with the horse, slept at the pastor's door
Heard the whispers through my enemy's walls
Rode the elevator to the thirteenth floor
Console with Gandhi, since God placed his hands upon me
I rose up commanding the army, demanding my laundry
Talk to monks, holding a pump
Y'all niggas wanna roll, what y'all want?
Shout at Satan, shout at the pagans
Cats waving, one of the brave men; Priest

In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal

I know somewhere my assassins await
Setting traps at my place
Phones tapped, all my actions are traced
I lay back strapped at the waist
Who's this bitch with a match in my face
I don't know, ""Don't smoke 'em, thank you""
Slipped something in my drink with an ice cube
Nice move, bright jewels, she's with this white dude
She said ""I like you, I'm in the right mood,""
And she comes with a price too, but as the night grew
She saw the black heart, the Archangel Michael
My gats spark vital, her arms show track marks
Close the rival (Priesthood)

In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment, y'all know the deal
In the heat of the moment, my enemies feel
The heat from my chrome kick, I can't sell
You hit an opponent, the shit gets real
In the heat of the moment

I Believe,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"(Sample from ""Some Other Time"" by The Alan Parsons Project)
""In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time
It's the evening of another day and the end of mine""

They counted me dead and finished
Though I never reached my limits
Alcohol and strange women
Soon it gave me tunnel vision
Sun will glisten in time
Humble listen for a sign
His baby mother on his mind
Stressing him for every dime
Filed divorced, while in court
She smiled across, wildest thoughts
Child support, now I lost
And I'm like ""DAMN, why recourse""
Meanwhile no deal, cold meals
Flow still, it's so real
""Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears""

Now I got my mojo back
Listen how I flow on tracks
Priest when opposed to rap
I could never be a poster cat
Blind faith lost my way
Many times, I often pray
Walking near where coffins lay
Names on them crossing graves
Or outlined in chalk on pave
Or an entrance to a court from a cage
The highway speeding like
I'm riding a Ducati bike
Finally I can see his light
Flying through a neon night
I could see beyond sight
Like Stevie on them keys of life
Playing for my freedom right
Esau called 'em Edomites
It's rare what you perceive as white
Dreads crush there weed in pipes
The head for the meteorite
It was you that gave me power
My first baby shower till I'm pushing up daisy flowers
Pull ups for eighty hours
Running to the mountain top
Like the man on the balcony shot
Know it was planned before Malcolm dropped
He stand before them cameras pop
While his wife and family watch
Hatred of a man pray this cancer will stop
""In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time
It's the evening of another day and the end of mine""
""Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears""",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-i-believe-lyrics
Energy Work, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Yeah, Wu-Tang, I feel great right now, youknowhatimean
This is it, The Psychic World of Walter Reed
Yo, RZA, just let them know something man
We been doing this for a long time, so, tell 'em RZA, one more time
Youknowhatimean, I feel great right now, let me bring ya'll closer to the culture
It's like Gandhi when he aided his first, something great, something special
Just like an eagle when he watches the NASA take off
Or horses by the runway, watching cars drive by
Well here comes the pain, youknowhatimean

There comes the pain
After the sunshine

Okay, a 108 celestial stems, stretch out my terrestrial limbs
Master the puzzle within, identify the coherent
Combination without aging, I'm spacing
That's just a metaphor, head covered like Skeletor
A fellow law, they said inside the booth is the fountain of youth
But within my ideas I found the reservoir
I let the presents draw, they used to call me weird out of fear
I did the impossible, with no clothes I walked on top of hot coals
Discovered pots of gold, now I jot the scrolls
The creation narrated pre-exist the foundation of language
The ancient and the infamous, untainted for the brainless
Breaking the elements, development, erasing the devilment
Taking from the sacred intelligence
Priest, the heretic, but now I'm from David's heritage
Escaping in an angelic ship, Cherubs did create the skeletons
Shaped through the melanin, embraced it by the Seraphims
In heavy rain, in space, shape the Nephilims
Divine order begin, recorded with my pens, why seek outward
The reward is within, Egyptian empires, hieroglyphic writers
Where they really fallen angels survivors
Was the Rosetta stone owned by Ethiopians
Or the rest of the holy men, we won't know til they shovel our bones
The Indian chiefs smoke opium, this is not blasphemy
Or the devil's symbol the Baphomet, this is just a rap word play
Stuff that I learned from the curb one day
I'm like Daniel in a cage with Gryphons, my face stiffens as I saw a great vision
Grey pigeons that shape shifting in the space system
Laboratories with apes missing, martial law
It's a state prison, Great Britain
Techno Priest, retro freaks, a computerized sun
With electro street, loungin' in a new world ghetto
Playing RZA beats, the AD I done lost clothe speaks
Jaguar paw, Walter the weirdo, what up RZA?
I place a universe inside of each verse
I know your soul need energy work
They said when he was young, he had seven suns above his tongue
The ark of the covenant between his gums

When I’m Writing,Black August,2003,"I just zone out When I'm Writing
Yo

The weed is lit
It's given like an Indian gift
Passed around in a cipher
'til the bitches need pullin' tighter
Put out the fire
Blow out clouds of stress
Now's the test
Who's the first to talk crazy?
You cough, maybe the weed is still in your lungs
You beat ya chest 'til that feelin' will come
You high, viewin' a cipher behind your own eyes
Sayin' stupid shit, but to others you wise
Me, on the other hand I zone
Find a little spot to myself
'til I feel I'm alone
Talk to angels with black wings, silver halos
Build with Gabriel the Messenger
I'm Hugh Hefner, with long robes
In a porn show, women with pretty toes
The dizziest ho's
Then I turn romantic, write in sanscript
I put on my vision that I see inside my pen
Black-out is When I'm Writing

When I'm Writing
Flows go through me right into my pen
When I'm Writing
It's the artist within
When I'm Writing
I'm in tune with the Solomon books
When I'm Writing
It's more than just a song and a hook

My pen's a crayon
With coloring books, displayin' chaos
The black seyance, with the ink pores radared
Age quasars explorin' where the mind caves are
A riches being dug from a king's graveyard
It's the inscription written on Egyptian clay jar
I write rhymes like I'm doing time
Listen, when I hit the pen I start doing the sickest
I got the flow locked behind each bar
And if I get too wild
You can throw me in the box of ya car, it's not that far
My pen's an airbrush, thrown over ya favorite sweater
My notebook's leather, I write with a feather
My pages look like a Renaissance painting
Visions of St. John's conquerin' Satan
All made from my imagination
It's Priest, Lord, the Bishop of Vikings
When I'm Writing


The way that I write, it's like a painting
I put on aprons
And brush my ink pen across the palette
Stare at the projects
'til I see somethin', then write about it
My pad's a canvas, filled with anthems
And words from the black panthers
To crack scramblers, to crack gamblers
To gat handlers, to cats in handcuffs
Doin' life
I lock myself in a room and I write
Rhymes I could do a life-time
When everything's relaxed
And I'm in my right mind
I sit still for months like a monk
'til Buddha bless me and grant me
With the wishes that I want
I want a thesaurus with clairvoyants
I rhyme for the enjoyment, my mind voyages
Ever since the day that man evolved
Scrapin' white chalk on candy walls
From the Stone Age of neanderthals
I've been writing",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-when-im-writing-lyrics
Color of Murder 2 (Old Castle Hop),Elizabeth,2009,"(Sample)
Elizabeth didn't confine her particular brand of domestic discipline to Hungary
On several occasions during her life
She was in Vienna to visit the court of the Austrian king Matthias
Despite protests, she tortured servant girls here at her house in Augustiner Strasse
(Hook) 2x
The color of murder part 2
Put ya heart in a cube
Than rip it in two
Pour molten silver in ya eyes
I'm a poet and an executioner
What color do you see when you die?

This one's called the Judas cradle
Operating table, chop the navel
It's very painful
First take off his white angel
The complaining wolves are very hungry
Never close the womb in his tummy
Curses open up the tomb of the mummy
Color of murder, lyrics are like burners
Talk to the bad spirits, open up the furnace
Get me the Virgin
Next is called the coffin torture
Hang 'em up side down, overweight
Sharp blades loose braces to support ya
Sometimes death occurs when idiots splurge out words
To the Mantineia, millennium emerge
Such pity, I get busy, stomp teeth on curbs
Go head whisper prayers, unprepared beware
And may you fall on death airs
Next is called the Brazen bull
Quiet, we in the woods with gazing wolves
I show up in the hood
Disturb ya, with the color of murder
The Virgin worker, tear drop, they kneel, stop
Watch his heels lock, from hip-hops to old castle hop
This ancient battle, bones break over rocks
Next is called the Rat torture
Very painful, send prayers to every angel
Than ask me what those heavy chains do
It's real, I kill so graceful
From the mount Grayskull
Pow, now you taste blood
(Hook) 2x

Water torture; turn my back, here comes Walter
Blood slaughter, drip, drip, drip
Till it's like a boulder falling on ya head
Ya friends, ya bird, ya dog, all are dead
Depending on ya crime, sentences is the rhyme
How about tearing off ya clothes
Burying you into the snow, up to ya nose
Let any animal or insect eat at you slow
Chewing thru ya bones
Scream as loud as you want, we're all alone
I will let you call ya moms but bars on my phone
Next the chair of torture
In the air prepare for my daughters
Beware when they cross ya, head's in the courtyard
Tryna escape, eh-eh-eh
(Hook) 2x

I have tortures exclusive for witches and liars
Blasphemous, homosexuals, I pull out the pliers
I heat 'em up in the fire
But now it's your turn since you claim you a writer
I perform rap torture, breast ripper
Look what my raps offer, who's ya best spitter?
Saw torture, it's war, make 'em nauseous
Slaying my iron maiden, I design for plague men
You praying, I ain't playing, the Virgin
I'm numbered, spikes on every wall
Hear their screams up the halls
Or when I'm sliding bodies in the morgue
Next, the Spanish tickler
The style is vicious cuz, or anything in particular
Oh, the Flagellation whisperer
Real torture, baby this
Young that, little this, I'll bought ya
Execution in my texts of music for ya
Look at me, look at Lucifer
I'm in foot roasting, for niggas boasting
Steak burning, take turns turning
Me and Walter in the Thumbscrew torture
Crucifix crosses, crocodile scute
Who wanna battle? I'm the New Yorker, a wild dude
(Hook) 2x

Holy scriptures, the state's prosecutors study Leonardo's pictures
All fraud from the renaissance age

Man controlled like a puppet, the Earth is center stage
I've been deceived by modern day Eve with a weave
Poison me with lust from venom, ever since she was made
From the rib cage, in a world of theatrics
Same wantin new Babylon, the Mac spits
Rose remain deep, like the masters who crafted ecclesiastics
Telepathics, communicate by telegraphics
Bomb and corrupt Catholics
Tie 'em to the stake like Joan of Arc then burn 'em to ashes
Hard rush when I catch slavery flashes
Been born again like Paul on his way to Demascus

My faculties stuck up jewels, 4 different diamonds

Annual bangouts from Jericho to New Jerus'
I walk through my hood like Christ with my apostles
Thief in the night, niggas watch my light reflect through my ice
The flame in my eyes, Gabriel's blood on my wings
Seven fold solo man, Eloheim crowned king
I walk through the desert, the Lord is my shepherd
I steppeth in the name of my father to pharoahs and fiends
Feed independence, I be the black stone in a column
My Mac-11 scope the seventh pope of Romaness scholars
My throne, is seated in soul, a sembiance placed in mine
The breath of life, livin spirit, now my soul embrace the knowledge
As I step in light, while the thug in me is chasin shine
I rise above the low and have the heat at guys takin up space of mine

Yo, yo, yo, ayo

Yo
Black posse, clap guns at the anarchy
White man in the van watch me
Video cams is in the lobby
We change skin tones like chameleons so they can't spot me
Runnin out the buildin, cops shot me
I played dead on the ground like you cowards got me
Until I heard the engine of my man's Kawasaki
I raised off the ground mad cocky
He shot past it and snatched my body
We cocked a shottie, popped three at the swat team
The black helicopters swoopin down, flashin (What? What? What?)
Thousand volt watt beams, watchin on TV screens
Streets are flooded by the Neo-Nazis
That's when Gabriel gave me shells
Then I load my automatic and I blaze the world
Fuck this world and everything in it
I ain't gonna stop until my job is finished
And my words are infinite
My life is governed by a higher force
Sometimes I think I'll end up like Christ and die on a cross
The sacrifice, close my eyes and the fire come forth
Start spazzin then I blackout, I'm grabbin my Mac
Clap at the dragon, the beast, that paddin my streets
It's organized in the hood where we gaggin police
I wake up stabbin my sheets, see the monster grabbin my feet
Pullin me beneath, havin a head like Bill Gates
With a mouth full of platinum teeth

Déjà Vu,Black August,2003,"Certain... Twilight zone

He stared at me with his cold eyes, who was this old guy?
Dragged him in the building, as police drove by
Took out my four-five, cocked it, put it to his forehead
Dugout his pockets, went in his shirt, and took his locket
Threw him near the garbage, aimed the gun and shot it
Then dodged quick, I dashed, so fast, felt the wind go past
Everything went in a flash, hopped over the trash
I ran around the corner, cut up the alley
And made it to the back-door, into the lobby, then I stopped
My eyes was shot, all my stolen goods dropped
My body stood still like a rock
I saw this kid holdin' a four-five, with the same old guy
With the same cold eyes, I looked out the building
Saw the same cop car roll by
It woke me out the trance when I heard a shot
Saw the old man cry, shit drop, by the garbage
Kid disappeared somewhere through the project
So I chased him, called his name, 'round the corner
Up the block, through the alley
Though the backdoor into a lobby
When I came in, I saw the kid backin' up, with his gat in his clutch
And floor full of stuff that he stoled from that man
I glanced over the kid's shoulders, I seen the same old man
Another young dude with the gun in his hand
Pointed at the old man's head, makin' demands
I looked out the lobby door, saw the same police man
Drove by, it was no surprise, I said shot
At the same time I heard a gun pop
Looked at the garbage, saw a man lyin' there crouchin'
Couldn't believe what I was watchin', I walked near him
Should I fear him, I said to myself, it's gettin' weird son
I told to old man, stared in his cold eyes
At the same time I felt the ghost go by
I looked up, saw me, holdin' the four-five
I glanced back at him, asked him, what's happenin'
What's the meaning? Am I dreaming?
He whispered, the locket that you stole from me
Open it, there's a picture
So I opened the locket on the silver chain
Saw a picture of him, and he had the same initials as my name
Hope I'm not goin' insane, I can't explain, somethin' is strange
I took off the old man's frames, put 'em on my eyes
At the same time, the old man died
Then I cried, I felt like something inside me died
It got weird too, cause out of nowhere
I asked myself, do I fear you?
And a beard grew, I felt my face, took out a mirror
Looked in it, my hair was silver and in terror
My body got cold, I broke the mirror, I felt I was old
So I closed the locket, put the chain over my head
Hid the picture in my shirt, like a curse
I stood up and walked outside
Where a kid was waitin' for me, with a loaded four-five
I didn't say a word, I just stared in his eyes
Said to myself, I know this guy
Then he grabbed me by my shirt, then he dragged me inside
I asked him why, but he didn't reply
Fuck it, I might be high
He reached in my pocket, he dug in my shirt
That's what I thought, damn, my locket
Went and pointed the gun and cocked it
Then he shot it, no, what's goin' on?...
He stared at me with his cold eyes, who was this old guy?
Dragged him in the building, as police drove by
Took out my four-five, cocked it, put it...",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-deja-vu-lyrics

Thugs thieves and killers let us bow in prayer
Our father who art in jail I shall be thy gangster
Thy kingdom of guns and thy will swing a razor
On the street corners as it is in prison
Give us gats this day and spray our daily lead
Who testify against us we pray they soon be dead
For thine is thy kingpin power and the glory
Forever more amen now pour out some 40s
For shorties 6 feet under hustlers and number runners
Surround our Ghetto Christ at the last supper

Bullets with tips that's hollow
Silencers that fit the nozzles, banana clip that follows

First there's Pistol Paul then there's John the Ratchet
Right across the hall two cats he sold his crack with
Along with gangster James the other killer Andrew
One like the Son of Man stood within the seven candles
With was a number spot raided by a hundred cops
But Ghetto Jesus stood there till a gun was shot
And there was a Murder Mark along with Tom and Phillip
They hung in the park
Talking 'bout stacking mills up along with Money Luke
Him and Peter Black the wild one of the crew
Never scared to squeeze his gat and there's the Nazarite
Shaking three pairs of dice kiss them said the Anti Christ
That's the crackpipe he blew on 'em rolled them on the corner
All his disciples got warrants
Crackheads that's the torment

Uh!, buzzing
Ok, let me count
It goes

It goes eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch a dealer with his blow
If he squeals we let 'em go
Tax his silly, penny blow
Niggas, spics, grab your nines
Cops is rolling down our lines
Sell your blow, get off the track
Hide your doe and flush your crack
Change your clothes, dump your gats
Stay on your toes, watch your back
And the officer picked this thug right over here
One grenade, two bananas, three hammers, four
Five vests, six bullets, now we want war
In the inner city bang-bang, he laid behind the fence
Trying to blow his nine at sixteen Crips
""I'm hit, I'm hit"" he yell to his clique
But they're busy running so they finish off the clip
Red rag, blue rag, one two three
Pants sag, du-rag, guns on me

Give me that money and then we're free

Bodies laying, shotty's spraying

Streets is mayhem, cops is aiming at our playgrounds
Looks like a grave now

Hieroglyphic writers from Cairo-Egyptian's tribal Bible predictions
Drug addiction to thug addition
On holy street versions of murders
Two cathedrals with dons as the icons of all his peoples
Shakespearian my theory is the great words that shake villages
Priest God gift to the Mic
The Dark Israelite, Cosmic Lord of the Project
Apostles, street gospel, hood astronomy
Crack astrology, crime philosophy, like psychology
Project anthropology but gangster prophecy
Seen through telescopes from herb
See land through colts and grams
The dope man aborts of lands on the word
Chill, chill, just chill, chill

Ooohhhh Yeeeaaaa
I'm +On The Way To The Top+
And you can not stop
I'm +On The Way To The Top+
And you can not stop
When you drop the drive and it's all Hip-Hop
Feeling as though you got
You gotta make it pop
And it's all Hip Hop
Yea, yea, yea...
Yeah, it's martial law in my hood
We're like sheep that surround by wolves
When the sun set the project turn into woods
Segregate instead of separate
How can we elevate when hate got us living in this police state
I see the Pope as a member of the K.K.K
We got enslaved when it's black solidarity day
While the Eagle of America is hunting for prey
We say, 'Eat them', 'cause our freedom been given away
They say my bars is like a law firm
Y'all niggas burn with short term
They wanna put a curse on my sperm
So when I bust off it turns into some maggots and worms
Too late, how to multiply my spurn is born
In the form of Malcolm X versus Damian Thorn
I'm sworn into this Oak with a crown of thorns
I asked my Lord for forgiveness
Before I jot me a sentence
A young king, they surrounded with princes
From the lineage of God's image
Co-defendant of my old descendents
This was the birth of a 'Sun of Man'
God's plan in Madonna's hands
Got Judas on the witness stand
Trial jury they glance
It's like Ham up in Haiti and France
Front row at the MGM Grand with coke gram
That's why my people grab eagles when it comes to they fam'

Yea, yea, yo
Aggressive and progressive, inspired to be the best of at
Anything I touch and I think of I'll manifest it
When I die, statues will cry blood like stigmata
Holes in my hand and feet die for this Hip Hop shit
Twenty percent style, eighty percent substance, intelligent but gutter
Street music I can run wit them
America, land of opportunities and death
Poverty and wealth, corruption and racism
(__*Speaking Spanish*__) but still I'm a park shooter
Got them fake dudes scattering, the kid is back
Enough flames to put in your hand
See my songs are more healthy 'cause I load them with facts
And my clique never slipping 'cause I load them with gats
Revolutionary minds street player combined
Park bench with a bottle of Don, that's what I'm on
I don't wear a head wrap but my mind ain't trapped
This is thug intelligence, the words are eloquent
But I smack them with the butt of the gun just for the hell of it
I'm like antibiotics to rap, hypnotic in fact
Melodical product of blacks in this nation of traps
I'd rather die like a G then go out like a rat
If the street life you chose you gotta accept that
I'm sinister syllable, serious subliminal
Sick of the ordinary and tired of the regular
Turned off by the strange, face make me throw up
They shaking they Nike Airs every time I show up
I electrify tracks, my rhythms are infinite
Y'all dudes is impotent, can't stand direct
My lines connect with intellect, man you gotta respect
Go to HMV spend a percent of that cheque
My mind is one of God's greatest designs
You do yourself a great disservice when sleep on mine
You can't hustle a hustler
Tangle with a tustler
To bleak you with the muffler
Quiet any loud fucker, swayed beige Chuckers
With the Army fatigues, the one wit the leaves
Like you hunting in the woods in the trees",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-on-the-way-to-the-top-lyrics

What up little nigga, what you smokin on?
Only 14, product of a broken home
Out late, tryin to tell me that you're makin your livin
Tryin to see how much weed you can take in your system
Indeed, take out the seeds, then he finished his sentence
Askin me what I believe, have I ever repented?
Type of shit niggas talk about when they get high
Passed out, hazy eye, lettin days go by
Bullshittin one another with the same old lies
Tryin hard not to show all that pain inside
Saw the clouds turnin black like an angel died
Preacher sayin you a curse if you don't pay your tithes
It's like that to the day that our loved ones die
Lookin up at the sky, ""Please sun come shine""
But all we see is dark days, ain't no sun rays
Only gun plagues, in My Hood

We've got Pirus and P-Stones
Damu and El-Rukn's, in Hell feudin, the 60's movement
The death of Newton, the resurrection of Clarence X students
The revolution, this is rebel music
The other day a young lady threw her baby of the roof end
Six niggas died from homicide and drug shootins
My homey's mom just went of the loose end
From drugs abusin, this is thug amusin
Bloods and Crips, huggin the strips
Lovin they clips, sittin on dubs in they whips
Folks, GD's and vice lords, when night falls
Black pimps and white whores, from the immortal words of Jeff Fort
To death do us all, the sets I recall, til we rest in the morgue
From the pilgrimage of Larry Hoover, to the Tribes of Judah
We live our lives through ya, in My Hood
Chorus

Cuz outside there's a Cold War
And inside niggas waitin on their roll call
When friends, dies niggas ride for their road dogs
Don't know why we all cry when the soul fall
Yo, we got uncles comin home from doin a bid
Move in ya crib, with 
you and ya rib
, is how a few of us live
The rest is always in debt, feel with heartaches and stress
Can't argue cuz God makes the test
I hear oldies from OG's who go OT
Some OD in doorways, out cold for four days
It's like that all day
We gat rollin 60's, foldin 50's
Triple-O's in the Windy City
Latin Kings, Manhattan Queens
Spanish cobras, band of shoulders, families of soldiers
40 busters, 4 corner hustlers
From west side, to Bed-Stuy
Neta's in fiestas in neckties, Wepa
Ese, and Chevy's with hydraulics
This is God Knowledge
Spin it down for the hood, it's all good

Hard Times,View From Masada,2000,"The prophecies of a poor man end on a train
Take his last breath
Slumps over drops his last bit of change
A mother pacing by her window pane
Staring hopeless at the gentle rain
When the messenger returns telling her
That her child was slain
She reaches for his picture frame
Open up the good book read the scriptures
And sighs his name
The skies full of flames
Streets are gothic
Twelve niggas lay dead in front of their projects
Reminding D's of a classic mob hit
Bitches gossip, about they men being targets, or suspects
Niggas in the lab taking goldenseal
For tomorrows drug test
Scared niggas hugging they techs
Don't want to get plugged next
Outside there's a bloodfeast
We all product, faced with hard luck
Since the wrath of God struck
Now we like ""Yo Tone let me borrow a buck""
He like ""Yo what the fuck""
Niggas was born to be skeletons
Or was it the curse of this dark melanin
When I die will I open my eyes in Hell again
With these jealous men
Lord forgive me but I smell a gin
On the lips of winos
Sent a plague turned 'em all into Albinos
With horns coming from their foreheads like Rhinos
Read it in my last testament and my hidden scrolls
See my icon straight faced with a torn robe
A beard and some cornrows
The whole globe hears when I perform my shows

We go from hard times to part-times
From part-time back to hard times
That's the start of crime
Till the day we see the father shine
Light on us, trying to warn us
We play the corners

I visit monasteries
Where dons were buried
Approached the bench with teary eyes
Tryin to con the jury
Christ said those of you without sin, cast the first stone
Those of you without ends, blast the first chrome
Is it the prophecies of Deuteronomy
That drove us to this poverty?
Trapped with starvin seeds
Fightin for sovereignty
Cold nights make the toddler freeze
Blood over my wallabies
Raining mahogany
Here's a dollar for the trees
We worship weed like idolatry
Silly bitches with conniving thoughts
Sticking knives and folks
Don't understand what it's like to be a black man in court
Niggas up screamin all night
Complaining that their handcuffs are too tight
Kicking on the cell till they cut out the lights
It's like a curse
Walk besides white women they start holding they purse
I just ask you for the time bitch
What you got anyway? Some of the Indians turf
The Beauty that once flowed from the Nile
Like the Moses child
The hand that writes is a good as the hand that holds the plow


Some say the spirit of a dead angel lies within me
Look in my eyes, they're empty
Poverty stricken beaten with the rod of envy
Lurking through the shadows of death
Dragging my wings, saw the image of a beast
Ram, dragon and queen, heard the bragging of kings
Whose laughter was as bitter as a scorpion sting
Forced in the ring with idiots so many cliques
Letting out automatic clips
A dead lady combing the hair of a bastard bitch
I spit graphic shit you ain't hear half of it
From my fucked up marriages
To dealing with miscarriages
From drinking with savages
Driving hazardous
I'm here today to meet the man from Nazareth
Where's the pastor? Show me where that chapter is",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-hard-times-lyrics
The Offering (Intro),The Offering,2007.0,"(Priest sighs)
UHHHHH
This is it huh? (Greetings?)
The Offering which you was telling me about?
What are they brining?
Their candles are lit, they walk in burning incense sticks
Holding their camels' head low while presenting their gift
(Your offering sir)
Exotic animals, perfumed oils, gold for the Prince
For the King dynasties your faced carved out a cliff
""Well done!""
I do the honors and call all you friends
In this ceremony of peace, here's the Priest Offering
Shootouts, drugs, liquor stores, broken projects
Where niggas jet... D's predict a war, I jog up my steps
I hear ""Freeze! nigga hit the floor!"" A yard from my rest
I drop my keys, someone clicked the door, I jumped in the apartment
I swear my heart left that time I dodged death
I said ""God Bless""
Salute the gamblers, one shuffled up a card deck
Ran in the room, dice game going on
Ice chain, folded arms
Niggas in a cipha one dude low
Throw them bones across the floor cause my thoughts of wars
Is going fast, I ran in, frantic, panic, damage
I paint Sanskrit across my canvas, outlandish
Watch the constellations take shape
My conscious elevate like binoculars
Eye on the great space probing along the face of the deep
To below on Earth where the cops chases the creeps and the thieves
""Priest lead us out of hell like Moses""
Past the snakes, all the vultures, the Greek sculptures
On the court buildings, chalk ceilings with cross revealings
The Lost Children they keep oppressing us this the Exodus
Cops arresting us so press your luck
Peace and togetherness forever kids
Imperative we free our heritage flee from the devilish and habitat
Black on black crimes and crack 9s we clap
They cuff your wrist behind your back
The ghettos infested with drugs and police
A wino with no teeth rose and said ""Priest, go preach!""
He had flames in his eyes, told me it wasn't from wine
Opened his arms then showed me his signs then read my mind
Said ""Yeah I look familiar you saw me when you stared in the mirror""
Drop off his dusty blanket
And what was standing there was a King's ancient royal robes
With diamonds and rubies, God's beauty, life truly
A blessing, in my essence, Priest
I slid the lid back off my coffin
This happens often before I started speaking, I start coughing
Then I said I'm back with another classic called the Offering
It started storming and hailing
The church start reeling the preacher falling over the pew
Peep another view I'm writing lyrics while fighting spirits they poking pitchforks
A hooker lip gloss smears on my cheek she threw her kiss off
While trying to stick a dagger through the Priest
Beyond the offering see the elephants come in
This is the offering
It starts off I used to finger paint While in class
The teacher sorted me to see a shrink, cause my craft
Was sorta different from the other students for instance when I would color
I would cut my finger smear the blood to describe a slain hustler
The painted brothers was seen in my drawing then that got boring
Then I moved to pictures with glitter on glue
A book of rhymes of street niggas I knew roasting
My brain's turning on the spit slow motion
Flames are lit within in my skull there's a thousand bulbs
Rotisserie shit lyrics I can't get warm I'm too piping hot",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-offering-intro-lyrics
When Will We Learn?,View From Masada,2000,"When are we ever gonna learn?
One day we all gonna burn
Life in the fast lane
Are we ever gonna change?
Same shit, different day
The price that a thug pay

I heard a wise man once say ""thugs pray""
But still slugs spray from the double barrels
Fallin pharoahs over the graves of the sleepin prophets
Release the pain from the deepest closet
It's like a secret that we keep in bondage
Mothers weapin from they projects
Cursed be that soul, send to haunt the empty halls
Memories painted on the wall
Like The Lamb's Blood on the doors, of the black Hebrews
Nowadays the same people on subway trains sellin street news
A ghetto movie, with no sequels
But I still show you previews
That will free you, from your evil
An old man, cookin her-on, over hot tea spoons
Old G's are all evil, usin dope needles
Wearin fan parafanil's
We live in the black hole, where no one can hear us
The valley of the dry bones, without reflections in the mirrors
The world fearers, first make 'em feel us
Come on!


The Solomon couldn't say it better
It's all vanity, and sanity
We come from broken families
My own pop's abandoned me, black becomely
The spirits of Lords upon me, I grew up hungry
Now we chase money, and live grungy
The fears want me, to bring me to the hills of this country
So they can jump me, fill me up with lead and dump me
Damn right I said it bluntly
I ain't scared of none of y'all monkeys
At school my teachers used to flunk me
Hopin one day I turn to junkey
But only God can judge me, words of Makaveli
Black Israeli, hear me? Told you y'all niggas gonna feel me
Killah Priest AK Masada, sincerely yours


So check out my darkest secrets, my truest confessions
Come to you as a blessing, parental viewing in this aggression
Is advised, tune in to the wise, zoom in your eyes
Step up closer, to the light, like that child on Poltergeist
Wisdom be ultra right
Explosive to the sight, 3D, virtual reality
Verbal mentality, come with me
Load up your gun with me, run with me
Become one with me, this is channel three
High definition, ghetto TV, DVD
Cable networks, stick your fingers
In the bullet holes in my sweatshirt
Take it out and taste the blood, so you can see that its real

So look at life, where will it take us?
Into the lights, stay strong and don't break up
Band together, the strength and unity
Be strong and live longer, this is not ya eulogy

Dearly beloved we gather here to celebrate life
Peace to Empuls he found my wife
May y'all never depart, I reach deep into my heart
Pull out every foul thing I've done
Where my eyes browse upon my son
Remember y'all the one so listen
Got a third part, which is the best part
So when you get out in the world the game of chess starts
Remember concentrate before you make a move
Deal with the truth in ya square
And remember God is in you
So you don't have to search outside the Earth
Just go inside this verse, plant the seeds in ya mind
Watch it grow high as a turf
Just look around - remember you are the Church


Victory is yours if you lead of course
End all, make sure you know what ya end is for
Remember every seed is pure, military wants you
The cemetery will taunt you if you let it
Help you escape the hands of the medics
Perfection and this message
You my sons, my reflection
And this is a deep lesson if you keep stressing
Will bring about a deep depression
The only answers is your friends in a weed session
Look read a Proverb a day, observe life's survey
Think of my grandma in the words should say..
""Don't run down the halls"" Now she's joined with the Lord
Walking down the halls, bless it the all
People rise, some fall, stand tall

Inhaling continents make me fatal to angels' halos
Grave clothes, eight crows peck death
Switch minds up, drink blood from a cup
Wizards and witch fables
Keep out of the reach of children, poison seeps through buildings
The psychic and the healing, the tarot deck
The pharaoh's death, the apple 
The maid paid one million for her crew dealings
This product can be ignited under certain circumstances
The virgin of a candle standing
Shake, and turn the can upside down
His spray, priest is on his way
From down syndrome to grabbing the crown to infinitive thrones
The clowns ascended from stones
Remove the small cap, from the spray nozzle and write ""Priest""
The praised apostle, running clockwords outside a circle nine times
Sit down, Indian style, to sip black wine
All competition is given death
From her words: ""All praise Elizabeth""

Crack unsaturated fat, this is King David's sedated rap
Praise and save your amen, I'm misbehaving on tracks
Arms of heron with elephant palms
The medicine strong I'm on
An death to all, cholesterol flow
Vegetable oil, mixed with hydro
He's wheezing,  needed, losing ounces from bleeding
Tube feeding, blood oozing from all regions
Of the body, harmful when swallowed
Palm full of hollows, songs of apostles
What's important, give it to you in portions
Call it caution, read directions if affected
Call 1-800-something, the operator answer blooded
I'm from the dungeons, who can fuck around, nigga?

From the county of the gods in the land of messiahs
Path of the thirty-three stars in the hands of Osiris
Babylonian talmudic setting
Speaking the Shekhinah in God's wedding
The messiah has a palace in the highest heavens
In a celestial temple mirrors the image of a earthly presence
Sit in mystic Hasidic circles
With God virtue
No curfew
Bars will unearth schools
For a hundred thousand years one king ruled
Then read the Talmud then Midrash
The pyramid vast
Beneath the universe
The moon will burst into gas
Rabbi ben holds a zohar
That speaks of the old gods
That walks in space becomes solar
God studies the Torah
Then split the night
Dividing the upper and the lower waters

Away from the sun
Worlds in the past and worlds to come

In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live
As the World Turns around negative and positive
At the edge of the nights, The Guiding Light
That leads to Another World
For the Young and the Restless beware of your Deathwish
To All My Children in the General Hospital
The most impossible
We got for you the final saga of the Street Operas

In my location is where they run the operations
You either stuck or getting bucked by the train station
Word is bond it be on after dawn
They hit you up bad and watch you drop and they gone
They 9 milliliters make bitches scream high-pitch like a tweeter
But shorty is a strong believer when he hold his heater
I use an ounce of my mind to make rhymes
And a half of my brain to cause rain
'Cause life is like a game with no instructions
Streets they be tussling to have a brother busting
The adolescence carry weapons in they section
A wrong direction, when they all pack protection
Forgotten knowledge, is all symbolic
And hedonistic, they need statistics, for cops to search
They pop you first and dig your pockets later
And maybe catch you for money or your pager (give me that!)
Or slice your throat with the razor..
An old man told me once, sitting on a chair rolling a blunt
""I had a son your age, that ended up on front page
From the impact of a 12-gauge
His assassination drove me in a world of hatred
Today is hard to face it""
He showed me old flicks, ""he was up for a scholarship
Today is hard to swallow it
Damn, I never thought life could be so short
I still see him on a basketball court
The bullet took a part of me, the doc said it hit the artery
Every now and then it bothers me
And all the prayers that I gave God
Wouldn't bring him from the graveyard""
That's when he took his picture
And said, ""young buck the streets'll get ya
It's either that or the price of liquor
Even me, I learnt as the days grew
That death is only a stage of phase two
Thank Allah that he made you""

In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live

What they discovered was each other
A band of brothers and sisters

But their skin bare fins and scales
A new beautiful world
A digital heaven
Nine crystal moons and suns that formed a rainbow seven
The scientist took notes of their sector
While the astronauts recorded it in their records
On board was a crew of doctors and professors
That took pictures for their lectures
What happens next is disastrous
The land and crew was destroyed by an asteroid
Only two survivors a man and a woman
The man was from the crew
The woman was from the planet
That didn't see the asteroid coming
She kneeled down and draws in the sand
So he can understand
She said her people called that land Idan
And that her name was Eva from a planet called Urt
His face full of dirt he just smirked
He said we'll name this planet after yours, then he pause
He get on his knees, then he draws

They have to touch it
So the ebony women you have to feel something
They change the faces of Queen Kahina
I guess they didn't want the African features over Medina
They couldn't change the faces of Makeda
The queen of Sheba
That made Solomon faint when he seen her
But that was a trick, he had to think before he breed her
Alexander the Great
Desire was to make his own race
Eurasian
After the invasion of the Asians
He put his troops in all nations

Outer Body Experience,The Eternal Thought of Killah Priest (Bootleg),2009,"I'm drivin', I'm speedin', I feel like I'm dreamin'
I'm thinkin', I'm drinkin', it's crazy
Funeral, my sister is gon', the dial is passed 80
It's hazy, I can't see straight on this freeway
No seat belt on, I'm buggin'
Buss a head, I see somethin', I can't tell if it's gon' or comin'
Suddenly I see a lightning, hear a horn
His head is straight for my face
I tried to smash on the brakes
It was too late, was this my fate?
I went thru the windshield
But experienced it from the back seat
I watched my body go thru, then flames blew
I felt the warm beam of light
I seen what they called the Christ
Look like I saw a bright wings that moved
(Hook) 2x
An Out of Body Experience
A close encounter of some kind
Please Lord Show this thug sign
You be the light that shine
Or peace in heaven designed
Was it outside this world or inside my mind?

Went out the back of the wrecked up car without a scar
Walked around to see my body, it couldn't be hardly
It was a dream probably; I looked again, God Almighty
My vision got foggy, I heard from a distance, sirens
I looked again, there goes those white wings
I felt now weight, somethin' grabs me
Next thing you know, we both swimmin' thru space
They showed me Ancient Kemet they existed in this place
At peace I saw the Canaanites, warm flames of light
The ancient head tykes
A place of 12 sons that lit up the night
A voice said ""Welcome""
My vision got bright, I saw the ancient Israelites
Purest crystal, visual and all white
They took me and embraced me, I felt safety
Handed pearly gates keys, my mind was spacey
(Hook) 2x

I saw the inhabitants of the Arabic Prince
Brines that couldn't even be recorded on films
I saw shim from the seed or the soul
The keeper of scrolls, the grim reaper exposed
His sickle over enemies of Israel
The sacrificial fulfillin' his will
The embryo in space embraced the son of Ishmael
The burnt faces were Asians, ancient the saint praises
Some were famous amongst men were nameless
The judgment, the covenant, the blood drip from the lamb
The Son of Man, comfort hands, the flesh is death
Except the new concept, too complex, we use ya conscious
A long rest, confess, your endurance is ya insurance
Then I heard a word spoke, paramedics said ""She got a pulse""
Everything disappeared like smoke
Then I awoke, tombs at my throat, surrounded by my folks
My moms sayin' the Bible quote - the Lord of host
Only knew where I been, what I've seen
The eyes of men, quiet y'all, he's tryna speak
I'm starvin', I mumble words, I'm hungry, I need somethin' to eat
Quiet deep, white streaks of beams driven from Elohim
The All Supreme, finally called Kings and Queens, Astral Projection
(Hook) 2x

The body of light, God made by night
Kefir, language of Angels, he speaks the marble in white
I'm eager, understand the language of plants
Too advanced, ancient then man, he spoke treegulus
He ate air, the breath therein and prestigious
The Anglen beings of all seeings, the fourth region
Mel Chezidek was there, all abort we leavin'
The boy king was there, the Nazarenes was there
So was Lucifer, and the tree of life

A baby grab a Mac 10 from off the shelf

God holds up the universe by wearing Orion's belt
The man from God's country
Where the monuments reconstruct themselves
A futuristic mind
Computer design
Modern tech priest nukes the world of crime
Of rogue elders hybrid warriors evolved angels
Pyramids become live volcanoes
Astronauts that found heaven
A crew of convicts and twenty-four scientists
Went their own direction
They discovered a god with a child face
Sitting on a throne with a crown and cape
He held in his hand book of the resurrection
They know on earth land they'll become legends
This Wu technology Wu great minds
Creation of a Killah Priest Wu-Tang designed
Wu-Tang explorers Wu flying saucers Wu-Tang everything
Wu-Tang enforcers
They saw the world to come
The gospel of apostles as blue flares shot from a mechanic sun
They all grabbed their gamma guns
Helmets was hellish
As my Uzi weighs a ton faces angelic
As a throne of fire creation of the Messiah
11 47 hours high-powered
Captain of the tower 51 Stargate a system
The target of victims
Are a new Jerusalem
The iron rust of the craft aluminum
The officers floated through the tube of titanium
Shooting at the creatures with the wide cranium
Sky Mesopotamian
The language that they spoke was Akkadian
As he blinks at the ball of fire
He saw the red rocks the dust filled air
Engineers from the spheres
They called his name Enoch
In his hands was a computer called a Sephirot
The Hebrew astronaut
Landed on an Egyptian planet called Ma'at
They said you're standing on wave fields of consciousness
The feet the black invisible light as the comet is hit
His man said let the monsters talk
It's like Malachi Z York meets Mr Roarke
The plant the plane the mothership lands
Those from heaven to earth they came
Let us make man

The astral plane it falls asleep it dreams of black holes

With OCD and it's in HD
Thief goons riding through sand dunes
To the Skull Woods with their power gloves
Overlord followed by wolves
With their horned headdres like a bull
Nine Bronze Age
The older gods struggling with the priest
And they're warring
The kingdoms grew violent
Over time after the war it was silence
The older kings blood rivalries and beliefs
Hit the streets
The prince is dead
The priest convinced it was the plagues
The sky was dark blue bleeding into purple
A hundred thousand demons feeding on her virtue
Spitzer space telescope
We saw the falling craft leave a trail of smoke
The man from God's country has a power glove
I can feel the emotions in water
Can punch out demons

The Law,Priesthood,2001,"A wise man will hear and increase learnings
And a man of understanding will obtain wise council
To understand a proverb individually
The words of the wise and the riddles
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge
But fools despise the wisdom and instruction
Heed the instructions of your father
And do not forsake the law of your mother
For they will be graceful way beyond your head
And chains about your neck
(Worldwide, look)

All of my pain is on the pictures in my enemy's frame
Written in blood, my ambition is driven by thugs
Got two Glock 9s and I fill them with slugs
Call me Saint Valentine, cause when I kill 'em it's love
Say my name, Masada, life full of pain and drama
Bloodstains and horror
Here my voice out the Hell flames, I holler
I write with the pen of the reaper, stare in my eyes
Look deeper, now turn into stone, it's Medusa
Reduce your flesh into bones, prey upon your dead meat like a vulture
Dig out your eyes, send your soul to Hell
While your body is covered in flies
Spazz like John the Revelator trippin off of acid
The desperate man with a handful of Tarrots
I'm the ghost of Mozart, possessed my arm
The blood of 2Pac drip from the pen in my palm
Stain the paper, swirl it around, see the vision
A thousand prophets locked in prison
Free 'em all with the rhyme, short sentence
Unlock 'em from my brain cells, plague the Earth
40 nights of rain and Hell, Masada, spell my name in braille

He who despises the Lord will destroyed
But he who fears the coming will be rewarded
The law of the wise is the foundation of life
To turn one away from the spirits of death
Poverty and shame will come to him who withstands correction
But he will dodge a refute will be honored
He who walks with wise men will be wise
But the companion of fools will be destroyed

I post up in front of the world, witness my pearls
Unleashin the masterpiece, actions twirl
Like a twister, the riddler, picture my moment
Filling scriptures with my niggas
I pour the liquor on my own, trick!
Bullshit, until the apocalypse hit
Laughin with the angels, just watchin the shit
Hands out your pockets bitch, the Glock'll spit
Leave the Earth in turmoil when I'm poppin' clips
Kill the devil, I'm the rebel lost in the streets
My only fears is when I sleep, I'll be tossin' deep
Or if the woman in my arms think of crossin the Priest
Proverbs, God words, nigga I'm talkin' to thee

Let's reverse the way of the righteousness
In the midst of a passive justice
I can establish the everlasting from the beginning
Before there was ever an Earth
Blessed is the man who listens to me
Watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors
For who shall revise me for his life and obtains favor from the Lord
But he who sins against me warrants his own soul
And all those who hate me love death

Telekinesis, I see through dreams
A conqueror of all world like the Hebrew kings
I'm David, reincarnated over again
A gladiator of the universe, a soldier of men
A warlord across the field, returnin from battle
With blood upon my shield with an arm full of arrows
I'm a warrior, elephants kneels as I pass
Holdin skeletons of the soldiers that I killed in my path
With the heads of their leaders still in my hands
Hold it up, lightnin strikes, brightens the night
Turn my hair whitened like Christ then flash out of sight
Head back to the cemetary, my job is done
Volume one, Priest, part two is when God will come
Read

Choices of wickedness brought me nothing
But righteousness delivered from death
The Lord will not soften a soul from righteous to fairest
For he casts away the substance of the wicked

That's right, we destroy all ya'll punks

L-Theanine
Tetrahydrocannibinol

Street, devotion, love an open slug makes ‘em soak in blood
Emotion’s touched, families clutch, mothers cry a flood
Wishful thinking , then it’s drinking or get high off drugs
What’s in the sky above? A zillion devil masks
Worn by the ugly face that makes mirrors crack
From a Christmas past, Crystals in the glass
Then the lighter, then it’s star trak
Then where mars at, they lose weight
Eyes dilate and roll far back, fuck that
It’s the god of rap, real niggas nod to that
My bars are facts, not fiction, the social system
The ecosystem, the theory of complexity
The cube, I’m talking neo-vision
Orange, gold, the sun, I’m talking, Leos listen

L-Theanine
L-Theanine
Tetrahydrocannibinol

Yo, seductive poison take out your fam, yo, you’ve been anointed gun in your hand, catch him in front of the unemployment
Through the news stand, bullets made a clear voyage
He grabbed a child for a shield, screams, he ran toward his car
But bullets beat him to the dashboard and his wheel
Holes through his neck and his shoulder
His last cries and alibi connect is over
True stories from a killer’s perspective, a nigga’s collectives
DA put him away, should have seen the smile as he exits
Project novels, Street gospels
Touched the soul, like a little girl is fondled
By hands that cold
The Tao and physics of Priest
Make lyrics that’s street
Vivid on beats
Mystic and deep
The eloquent, intelligent
From worlds above and beneath

Verse III
It goes off like a silent bomb and quiet screams
Invasion of a killer army from violent scenes
From a snow castle wearing frozen crowns
Gold tassels, fringes hanging form his royal gown
Mountains, ivory fountains, walls of mac 10s and SKs
Esés, gold-headed falcon
Colored glass windows on his limo
Gladys Knight can’t it be all so simple
Peep the raw dosage
Quiet explosive of the writers focus
So esoteric in high voltage
Like 200 milligrams of dilaudid
I’ll have ‘em nodding

Seven billion stories, angels kneel before me
I build it for majority, seniority, I photography
Prophecy, my bread conceal maturity
The one man that's more than everyone, minority
I stare in the mirror and see infinity
Deep entities, galaxies and planets
A king leading infantry, I see immortals
Majestic, since boar head - the Caesar
The afros, the cornrows
I'm blessed with more flows
Just accept it, no homo
The holder of the rainbow and the volcano
Flows both fierce and precious
My garment alike, these are bar mitts I write
Like the Bar Mitzvah of Christ
Hare Krishna when I'm holding mics
Behold when I spit a sight
Israelite, I could spit death and hell
Dead body's skeletons inside a cold cells
Or the ringer of Church bells
The breaker of spells, the healer
Hopes life is well, the Killah
My raps come out of a shell
The pen hits, my mind click
Tongue led off hot nails
Crucifix, Judas' pix, you wanted to flow
The lifestyle, what if I had doe?
Y'all wanted the gold and all the ice now
I write down, what if I was rich?
None of y'all wouldn't exist
I'm convinced my son is a prince
Under my skin is wonder of men
Kingship, wings sprout pass the genes
Cover my clips; I'm strapped with mac-10's
That murder y'all demons

The suffering poet, the ladder to Imhotep
From the grave of Joseph, the journey like Moses
The mercy of Jehovah, thou requirements
From my higher intelligence, from my wars in heaven
The Lord is my Shepherd, born again
Draw my weapon, days of longing
Strong within, over grave that's storming
I descend and sit in my throne
Out of hells catacomb, the ladder of stones
The castle, I prepare my rhythm and poems
Take off these chains, Priest speaks 700 names
No one is the same, until redemption
My rhyme concealment to the time of revealing
Intertwine, smell the hemp scent
Smoke the weed that's growing in my thoughts
I stand next to the Pale Horse
The captive emcee, the sleeping prophet
Rappers forcing the end, calling on the comet
Rhymes are atomic from out of God's department
Topic, my head is the cave of four winds
The plague, I draw with the pen
Armaged' I saw with my lens
I stand in front of you all
Divided by a Red Sea walls
Look ahead I see shores
Walter Reed, peace, I endure
There, where there's no vacant place or an empty place
Gases avoid, I started with the one thought asteroid
Eye lids open up, solar flux, burdens uncoiled
In this formless mind, the asteroids erupt
The small rocks blew up into dust

I said to my son, my son said to me
That we gather my beam, behold I am the three
The trinity, the words said to myself, let us form a rhyme
My spirit moved across my mind
We debated for days with wordplays
And the word became flesh when I entered the text
Enter my page thru no sex
The rap conception, immaculate
My rap's to die for, the lost lessons
Crucified the rhyme, to rise in three minutes
A new sentence was invented
My rap's adventure is endless
My poetry is strong, my art's pure
But my heart and my rap is relentless
Not to get religious but these rhymes are pictures
Vivid as Black August or historical scriptures
For listeners and visionists
From the carving of the rhymes talk
Awakens an ancient force
Imprisoned in my poem's source
Zone, no limit in the realms of thought
Unborns must die
Loosen up the saddle of the ghost horse galloping in the sky
Divinity track lucky seven, infinity's back
God codes been broke, now the memory's zapped",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-i-lyrics

Who helped form the man from out of the dust
Who helped make the lands and fill the sea up? It was us
In greater form, we helped create the storms

They hold harps and play God his favourite songs
Touch the heart and make it warm
They taught the preachers, they sit on 
ether
Some say they touch women in the bleachers give them seizures
They fight demons, they like creeping
Angels, they govern kingdoms, yo come on


Angels, they brought the message from the heavens
Confused man about immaculate conception
They dress in all black in their presence
They know the answers to mans questions, while he's questing
The 
cherubim
 in the jeroboam
Man should cherish them, but don't worship them
Why? 'Cause they here to service men
Angels, they walk with plain clothes never let their wings show


Angels in which you imprisoned, show us visions
Play with your children, introduce us to women
They surround leaders and politicians
Acknowledged by Christians, followed by wisdom you can hear them
They could be around you right now, sitting with their wings hidden
The ghosts of the night drifting, float on the night skipping

See my most desires
Smell the smoke from my flesh as my ghost rise up
Hear the voices of 100 choirs
And angels looking down at my body attached to wires
Priest kissed by the widow spider that spit saliva
I write for lifers and boxers at Rikers
I write pain
Blue ink replaced the blood in my veins
Thug in this game, flooded up rings
Cluttered up change, quick to pop a slug in your brain
If you a killer, then slugs we exchange
We like the mobsters, bullet shells and choppers
Cop cars and road blockers, they tryin to knock us
Catch us duck behind the bitches, d's tryin to pop us
On CBS News while the world watch us

I do this shit for my thugs
I do this shit for the chicks at the club
I do this shit for the niggas that I love
I do this shit for the streets, cause a nigga gotta eat, luv	(2x)

I write theories that's motion pictures, y'all hear me?
I spit it clearly to roast y'all niggas, feel me?
Gangster, life of a don my icon
Sling on my right arm, rubber grip tight in my left arm
Body suited with teflon, it's Brooknam
Raise a eyebrow at the child, respectfully bow
Pay hommage, gold studs in my garment
Hot slugs miss me cause I'm God-sent
If it hit me, it's God's wish
No man taketh a life, I'm late in the night
Catch me in the hood shakin the dice
Contemplatin a heist
Some say my team is Satan's alike
Cartel, pop shells till our heart fails
Brooknam, a.k.a. Roswell
Clappin at the spaceship
Bitches with fake tits
At nightclubs
We live the life of a true thug


I feel a holy spirit comin on me
My lifestyle: based on a true story
Read the credits: name appears alphabetic
On clear film with no edits
Masada bleedin in the hands of medics
Priest, I live it epic
Spoke on records, majestic
Physique: I stand six feet
Observe my posture, my click's deep
Director's edition, just listen
The words breathe on my sheet, I write a novel
Speak on behalf of every slain apostle
My slang's hostile, say my name as gospel
Masada, pop 2 through the confession booth
Don't say nothin, pull my weapon and shoot

Telekinetic, writing ambidextrous in their lectures
When I'm rhyming it's esoteric
Actual facts Mt. Everest, 29,141 feet high
What's the weight of the sky? The actual length and size
All I know is that I can't fit in it when I rhyme
I'm about this high, use your mind for measurement
I'm about to give you an estimate
Use the scribes for testaments
When I spit it's either a polar shift or a solar eclipse that's it
So when I write I breathe the breath of life into the Tree of Life
Chop meat like the Edomite
So raise your fist for your freedom rights
I visit like the Rizqiyians visit Nigerians

Creation of a Super God,Planet of the Gods,2015,"VERSE I
First the brain created itself
Inside of a mind
Around the island of thoughts
In a world before time
Then a fiction process starts
By telling itself it had a heart
The imagination began putting itself apart
This is called the animations period
By collecting proteins from the star Sirius
Let us create gods after our own images
From his own genes formed the king mysterious
Later transformed into a ruler
Then placed inside of a computer
Then later turn the mic into the future
That turned pens into bazookas
I'm from the world where gods are the prophets
Technology turned cheetahs into rockets
And lasers turned eagles into starships
The mind can build y'all never stop it
The rhyme's a wheel within the cockpit
Twelve hundred leagues under the sea
The god scientist formed this MC
My mic haunts the future city of dreams
Artificial gravity space viking around rings
VERSE II
Through the galaxies fallopian tube
I came out in a goo
Widen my view
Horizon atomic energy fuel
The first post-cyber rappers were used like super robots
With a fixed sequence of subplots
Hundreds of rappers would come from one blood drop
Blood clots wizardry on gold box
This science was called the stock character process
With organic arial objects
His first planet life feel
Was called the play test
Where he spit on the clay and made flesh
Infinite mind where the great light spun
In the orbit of the  eight white suns
The double phoenix ring
I came from Venus a king
Submerged in my mother's womb I was a submarine
Shooting rhymes like a pilot of a giant bio-machine
Attacking the central nervous system of religion
Read the verses on my pigment
Before I bust into the pigeons
And flap around the earth with a bat's envision
I rap intuitions
So listen to my mission
Then I turned my telescope into the heavens
The skeleton the ghosts the legends
The rhymes I wrote were weapons
As I rise out the molt a shepherd
Your demise 'cause you approach a leopard
The results it supersedes the expectation
Millions of volts breathe into a X-nation
Always inventing something new
I'm above the sun the stand point of this view
A billion worlds above the noon universes
Revelations
Space locations
Vanilla sky
After planets collide
Genocide
Alien hive
Lost tribes on horse rides
Holding a torch it's dark get scorched in the stride
Rappers falling short circuits
The thought merchant
Sea urchins MCs worship
Bottom feeders

Now followed the creature

I walk past, they start wavin'
Each arm, a thousand bracelets, face it, I'm the greatest
Made women drunk from the royal fragrance
I rock the latest in fashion, my jewelry flashin'
In other countries, they can hear my magnums
When they blastin', I heard they sound like thunder clappin'
Hit you in your stomach, watch you start gaggin'
Who gives a fuck if you're platinum?
If you're lyin' in a wooden casket
For good, now that's 'hood...

Yo, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess

The sun, you see him quickly when I'm poppin' my gun
It's on...

Thou shall fear me, only as thou'se been guilty
Feel me, sincerely yours, Priest, now industry tried to kill me
Before sat at tables, like the Savior at The Last Supper
Amongst nine rap lovers, three crack hustlers, with gats covered
Peep my last words, in the Proverbs, observe me
If you're worthy, I 'member your ass show
When ya'll was wet and cold, I cover ya'll with robes
Gave ya'll flows, when ya'll give ya'll soul
I gave ya'll flesh, covered ya'll bones
Breathed in you, sat ya'll in thrones
Now ya'll betrayed me, I raised thee from babies
To ya'll were grown men
For your birthday, I gave ya'll your own pen
To write with, beware of vipers, and snakes and biters
I taught ya'll about the depths of words and dark sentences
Now ya'll don't remember shit, but try to mimic it
When I see my crown, just give me it, it's mine
Seek your own rhyme, it's on, seek your own rhymes, come on!


I lay rappers down, with the mac or the pound
Pop 'em, stretch 'em out with they backs to the ground
Leave 'em lost in the woods, gotta find them with hounds
My four five'll turn a nigga from fatigues to bow-ties, no lie
Put a nigga close by, the Most High
Or he's a Dream Catcher, the Indian myth, pick one
Semi or fifth, your shell get hit, ladies spell my shit
A-D-D, I-C-T, I-V-E, lick your lips, come try me
Contestants, hook 'em up to I.V
In hospital, I pop pistols, fellas get ya hit like Hot Nikkels
Killah Priest, the Priest Stone, or High Priest, I pop three
Leave rappers in memory, the winner be me

Forever Regime,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"I laugh at you peasants, the death birds keep peckin'
I'm destined for blesses
My lessons adolescence till I'm out of the presence
Her outta the essence, the hour of seven
The tower of heaven, the power of legend
I place flowers on dead men's, you cowards beheaded
Dark clouds hover the Reverend
My rap industry, ministry, her menstrual bleed
Every couple of years, here's a cup full of cheers
While she's cut from her ears; to where the other is pierced
Die bitch, we back ridin' the Cherubim
Back leapin' from wing-to-wing mockin' you
Jack honorable Kings, infallible
Vendetta, Berettas wit treasures in Queens
Together we sing forever regime
(Hook) David
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime

Came to reign like the Prophets, let it pour from the sky
Look close; see the Empire formin' in my eyes
It's like a thousand stars shinin' for a moment in time
Had to fight thru all the haters layin' dormant in the sky
So I started from a Trojan, cut the cord and I cried
""Please Lord"" I live for glory, evil forces to the side
King David in my splendor, I was gorgeous in my prime
Had armies ridin' horses look like Porsches when they glide
No borders on my fortress, here's the portion of the pie
I traded fortunes for a name and stabbed the order in its eye
The warrior stood tall like a sword was in spine
Brought 'The Offering' wit Priest, said the source was in ya mind
Make sure the angels sing the chorus, holdin' torches for the tribe
Tell the story for the shorties and record it till you die

The planet ran to Mars, rest of y'all granted the hand of God
I can't stand it, crack the granite when I'm managin' bars
The paper scratched out, lookin' like a bandage and scars
But I survived far enough to see the guns in green
Pearly essence like the ocean, its so marvel to see
I'm audible like the presence of the Lord when I speak
The world is an audience designed for my glory to breathe
Recordin' my deeds enormous like a feast when I feed
Mental fruit to the people not what the snake gave Eve
We need to kill off the evil wit the force of gang green
So I can transcend to heaven as a spirit and gleam
Throughout galaxies, stretch like an infinite stream
The power is limitless, Priesthood combined wit the Kingz

I take a verse from Saint to hallelujah without a hollow point
I still move right straight thru ya
Lines like a wop-bama-booma
Smack ya head thru the Mardi gras
Mighty far, the Calhoun fall
Eat my way thru this track for a mars bar
Back to the Chicago line
Ain't no train gon' off this track
Pilot ready to crash, I'm off the Richter scale
They gettin' ready to bring a better deal
My raps is whateva, foreva kill
Heaven's the mega skill
Type my hype shit, wear a crown like Evansville
I keep it straight then a better business bureau
Serial killer wit more bandana then thrilla in Manila
Wit split seconds away from being simple
Burnin' thru rituals, make a cloudy days become visual
Don't get it fucked up, whether it be sunshine from digital
Gut splittin' on spiritual, lunar draws original
Wit heat seakin' material, 60 Sec the miracle
Mind fury icicle, cold pop ya top like a Michelob
Don't make my circuit or triple load
Open ya mind up like vapor, I'm the Vicks in ya nose
Open you up till I become a hole in ya soul",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-forever-regime-lyrics
Gallery of the Gods,Planet of the Gods,2015,"Each unit of the ascendant life is a veritable training school that the stage of existence just ahead
A school which is attended by ascending mortals until their translation to the regime of the superuniverse and the attainment of spirit existence

I hear nothing in the halls of gods
See me walking on floors of stars
Paintings on walls so large
A sea of orbs and stone citrine from the planet of Mars
As history takes my hand
Leads me to a victorious land, down ladders that spiral
Resembles the helical strands
Of DNA or Jacob's ladder or the pineal gland
Beyond Pluto, saw the hidden places, the creations of new globes
As we travel I look at 9 like whoa
As we ascend into the divine abode
3 billion 6 hundred and 80 million miles away from the Sun
Divine clouds open up, my density comes
And with it, its kings from off every planet
Trillions keep coming while the rest is standing
We stood enchanted, I spoke first
""I represent the planet Earth, my place of birth""
There was silence around the Universe
For a time and times to come

""You're in the galleries of the gods
Amongst the legends, in their presences from galaxies of afar
Kishar, Melchizedek, Enoch, Ishtar
Moses, the man from Nazareth, Khufu and Set
The Merkavah Machael and Gabriel
Abel, Adam and Seth
Gallery of the gods
Amongst the legends in their presences from galaxies of afar""

I said ""I am the king of dark words
That put rhymes together in proverbs""
Again they said nothing, they just observe
Then the silence broke, one spoke and said that we're honored
Well done, now welcome the lord of lyrics
They all applaud as I'm standing in my over spirit
It's ultra mystic, travelling through our bodies
Are lightning bolts and blizzards
They said, ""Come, we'll build an upper room in the place
And spread a roof in the black silence
We'll call this place your rap Island
Where you'll be writing rhymes forever and making albums""

You're in the galleries of the gods

Amongst the legends in their presences from galaxies of afar

The day I was thrusted to the councillorship
They shown my cinematic clips
Proto-Sinaitic scripts, enigmatic words of magic and hieroglyphs
There were people and tongues in tribals and cliques
The empirical contemporaneous data from black matter
That hammered the ring in the heavens
They said, ""Your being will be a rap legend""
I got power, picture rottweilers running up the watch tower
Into the omnipresence, my cinema
My brain is a replica of Nineveh
The heavenly body produced the celestial body
At high rates produced the terrestrial copies
All up and down Ur, through the Nile valleys
Up in Kish to the land of Mali
Decorate the temples with Walter Reed's initials
His writings and epistles all through the gods' galleries
Emotionally paralyzed as the pharaohs died
Dogmatic, unable to see beyond rules
Grip closely on doctrine is not cool
They can't agree to disagree
They don't discuss, they attack
A-alike attracts
Do not choose to proceed to understand the world
Disconnected as their souls were hurled
They copy the ideas
And take credit without contributing new things
They are addicted to hype and conspiracy evils

How Many,The Offering,2007,"My mind is designed like a Mayan pyramid
When you climb up the steps
You can get where the emerald is
I left witnesses for those who didn't believe
Show the depths of sentences, y'all forbidden to leave
Alphabets become images, you listen to see
How the breath of the lyricist can breathe 3-D
Trapped in each bar, it gets deep with the God
Like the five pillars that they teach at the Mosque
Try to defy Killah and you seek a mirage
Terrifying thriller, have you reaching your heart
Priest finna get dark, dark as he can get
Dark as the first nine Pharaohs that ruled Egypt
Dark as the moon cast the shadows that cause eclipse
Dark as the ladies with the tarots telling you secrets
Dark as the gun barrel right before you squeeze it
I enter your mind like an auditorium
Your picture was distorted but I restored your film
Now you see clearer, my pen has a lens
Like I'm sitting in a theater
Come back again
Remind you of Rakim, but I'm not him
Though we one and the same, the second coming of Kane
I'm like Kool G Rap, put the Uzi in rap
Or KRS One said it was cool to be black
For Slick Rick announced that the Ruler was back
Back in the days when gold jewelry was fat
Before Wu or Biggie, Nas, Jigga or 50
That was New Yiddy, they ruled the city
On the West Coast, it was run by Death Row
Pac gave 'em Thug Life, but I just hug mics
The grip of the python, the strength in my right palm
Will crush a competitor's life form

How many MC's must I defeat?
How many rhymes must I show 'em technique?
How many metaphors?
How many letters in all
How many times must I show you I'm better than y'all?
(2x)

Rhymes after rhymes, metaphors and lines
Since eighty four I recall the time
Left MC's inside of morgues and shrines
Weak technique get absorbed like wine
Then I piss 'em back under the trees and vines
This rapper that rapper I proved I'm better
Next one, I'm about to battle Webster
Do you think you can handle my pressure?
The weight of my thinking when I play with the ink pen
Is he old or new school?
Nah - I'm in a class by myself
Plus I drop math then I blast like a stealth
The bars you spit I use for chin ups
Soon as you lay 'em down, I press the bench up
Then I start spinning like them windchucks

Fire Stone, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Yeah, it's Killah Priest right here, The RZA
You gotta go in on 'em, youknowhatimean
It's been a long time, a long time coming, play games with him, yo
It's going on, I'mma go, ight

I spit dope, a triple mean, mixed with Listerine, in my sixteen
Kill rappers pon contact, rap combat
I drop lyrical bombs at, my palms crack
Microphone tribal stone, long gats, bullets get thrown
Tear up your flesh, break your bones apart, complicate your heart
Flatten your arteries, put your brain in a park
It's hard to breathe, arguably, my niggas glide on the arc
Lyrically, rearrange your face, banana clip for my apes

Nahimean, you know what this is, it's Priest and the RZA
Ugh, yeah, yeah, we been doing this for a long time
Yo, Wu-Tang, Sunz of Man, we gonna go all the way in

Black heavens, a palace with bulging walls, that push the paintings awkward
Above the broken floors, Roman war
Iron fingers, look, I just broke his jaw
Bodies lay like dolls, coming from the great fog like Greyskull
From a graveyard, through cave walls
Check out the cover, it's that Malachi Z. York? Nope, that's just warped
With a psychic mind and deep thought
From a palace or a shrine with street talk, ready to blow heat off
From other worlds, balance on a see saw
No one's rougher, hang with Goliath brothers, snatch a table cloth
From the last supper, wrapped around my dome
Just grab the microphone, and spit the bible through poems, I'm in my zone

Youknowhatimean, you know what's going on
Priest and the RZA, RZA and the Priest
Youknowhatimean, Psychic World, let's go

I'm like King David, wings waving, psalms in my mouth
Armed in my trials, with gauges
Holy orbs been doused, I'm royal from the 8th house, great bout
Seven churches, seven virgins, seven spirits, seven lurking
Seven stare, seven lamps, seven prayers, seven seals
Seven ant, seven horns, seven angels, seven trumpets, I crack you like the dawn
I break day over your head, pray for the dead, golden veil, chosen hell",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-fire-stone-lyrics
Wubian Nation, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Yo, I move like a UFO ship, a smooth prince
The eloquent stance, intelligent man, while shooting
Rhyme from the Byzantine face, with seven holes
Nuwaubian, Israelite faith, my weapon blows
Fire pearl, fugitive chased from higher worlds
Priest move through FBI states with white girls
There's benzodiazepines, sedate the culture like the Europeans
Two hundred grams of , build sculptures
Of the high proximity and fitted me pale
Paradise lost alone in this wasteland, he wears an ice cross
Lamping with the gold white Porsche, lights off
When he talks, breathe so cold you see white floss
You can see the sidewalk, you can see the white chalk
American tragedy, men who killed Malcolm
Icepick, confessions of a Mafia hitman and crime families
Brother minister, the brother's keepers
A sick grin, they cleared out the mall with street sweepers
Try to front, tell, in the hood, will bury ya
Priest sniff out beats like dogs sniff out bodies in wooded areas
Investigation, journalists on child murders
Jihad sip with serial killers, KKK and the hot burners
Every eye lurking, slay the beast when my iron emerges
Killah Priest throw fires at serpents

Prince of Persia, five fifties, most of us sly and shifty
Can't take the cake when you die, why evict me?
Diamond cut needles on the twelves, my niggas blow off the sales, come back derailed
I speak with the strength of power sour, black reefer and flowers
Build me a palace in Egypt, I own McDonald's
Cranberry grenades, hood parade
Make sure my peoples safe, send the US the cure for AIDS
Everybody know my portfolio, Gucci sneakers on
Looking real, yo, this is my polio
Bro man with the gold lamb, gold glam
Show his hand off, I got the Scorpio in sand
Brand new rebels, rolled up, keeping it pulled up
Snatch your kilt, sipping African milk
My levels, is more higher then them devils
Check me in another ghetto, the circle",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-wubian-nation-lyrics

Boast not against the natural branches
But if thy boast thou bearest not the good root
That the Lord has planted
You who will rule the planet
For if the first fruit be holy
The lump is also holy
The roots and the whole tree
And thy will grafted in amongst them
Being while olive trees
I'm looked at your trunks stem
I see the strange fruit hiding in your leaves
A dollar tree, trick-knowledge is their policy
My souls be set on fire
I rose from the depths from liars
Breath of Elijah
Never the less be full of joy and comfort
To the worldly things and out with things and conquered
Strange women and parties and alcohol
I devour them all
And gave 'em back when I heard my call
Cause I felt you there
You had my back when no one else cared
It's like a flare burning in mid air
All I could do is stare
I feel something in my system
It's more than a rhythm
It's just a voice calling me back to redemption
I'm walking over heated coals
Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
This life's eternal, I write my journal
If y'all could feel this
Feel something touching my spirit
I see the clearest that I ever seen
This must be what heaven means

Name till I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And my buckles where my barrels is kept
But I don't need it anymore, it's pure
Devotion I saw, I'm hoping he open this door
Remember not to transgression of my youth
But witness my grand presence; God made me new
The patience, the aching, the praying
Long suffering, the dedication, the new creation
To my adversaries that I would have buried
It's not necessary, the old things become new
And this is true, straight out the blue
My spirit is renewed
Out of body experience what's my options?
The adoptions, the glory, the covenant
The giving of his judgment, the government
The service, the promise, and the fathers
And that shall cover it for Israel

Having to abolishing their flesh, amity
And the Lord has slained all my enemies

But fellow citizens of his lineage

Strung out, never that, young dude, clever cat
Eat shit, smoke spliffs, get high, reminisce
Innocence, bulletproof, any one, pullin' through
Junior High, do it fly, fuck in grade Summer school
Comin' through, get me drunk, blunted too, every month
Hundred shoes, every son, wanted jewels, never front
Got older, hunger grew, watched most the younger fools
Squat out from the guns they usin', not close to the most of them
Quarter rolls, microphones, one, two, revolution
Sons due, evolution
, in a rhyme, ghetto music
In the mind, cuz I'm movin, in time, intwine
Lines all out of ideas, thoughts expose the road
Painted pictures, mask very clear, like a spear
Fallin' from the atmos, 
my raps soaks
In the pages
Kids I play with, different flavors, instant paper
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I just breathe, the breathe of life in the mics
I fill my notepads with sites, now, guide you like God did to Israelites
I just breathe, the breathe of Imhotep
Into my cassettes, fate awakin' you, holdin' in like herb in your chest

I'd rather spit it to it right, then a dome
Like a jewel in a throne, microphone, recite a poem
Hypotone, mellow out the ghetto route, track thugs meadow out
Crack blood devil house, gat slugs, here's your addict
Pushers of conceited habits, took us, look and seen me mad it
Cash laws, blast hog, gas talk in the hood
Black boars, burnin' wood, crack walls turnin' good
Nickel bags, crystal mag, blackout, semi' four
Black watch, ready for war, sasquatch, fantastic four
Blood, strength, through the Clan, wear the colors of our black
Love our mothers, love our dads, sister drug out on that glass
You ain't mad when they ain't sell refer, jump out the window, chasin' Jesus
Hunt me in the garbage, told me, he's a prophet
Used to recite scriptures, and dust, now our skin poppin'
Gems drop in '88, baby cake, first born
I'm crazy late, words long, worst one was '91


Second son, I'm stressin' young, blesses come, record deal
Kept it real, tess my skills, '96, my third born
Word born, vicious like he held him tight, and mellow hobby
I'm the father and the author, change my name to Masada
First rhyme, search mine, first crime, I stole a ring
Sold it, soak in dreams, felt guilty but the feelin' passed
Learned to put, all my feelings in my past
Kids that had a thinking, took my books and bring
Gave you read, all these laws
Blow coasts, smoke spliff, old flicks, focused
Flip cake, chicks scrape, that's me, thick braids
Swift blade, in the pockets, sick days in the projects
Slick way, I'm the stocking cap, I just got in rap
Family, photo albums, gun, drugs, know the outcome
Book, sweater, picture very, wedding flicks, obituraries

O Emmanuel (Zoom),Behind the Stained Glass,2008,"From her womb I went zoom
Through a misty gloom pass the moon
Through a gape in deep space
Finally I had room
To create, I shift shape
A single thought brought me through warps
I transport to a spiritual land but not loss
A strange cause
I circled around, driven by force
I lit up the night with light
Become one with the light source
Just like a hawk, with black wings
Black as the night, flapping
I go up, the stardust left in my trails
From a strong thrust
I felt the rush blowing through a gust
1200 spirits flying out of me
I see an odyssey
There was Enoch, Elijah, Emmanuel
The man with nails
Through his hands and feet
Blessed the meek
I felt asleep in the deep, couldn't speak
When I awoke, still a ghost
Still afloat, Assyrian folks I see starring at me
24 elders called the ""Lord helpers""
Behind them were many more in white they all held doves
6 on the left, 6 on the right
Now let the 12 judge
Books were opened, I looked at the golden throne
For them that was chosen
I looked again, catacombs
I see scattered bones before this chapter close
Let me break it down for ya
Enoch represented that the black man is in us
Elijah meant the sun fire
That's why he was taken higher
Emmanuel showed us the black man's hell
This white man's jail is their heaven
Wait on the seventh
I'ma show you where we're heading
(Jeni Fujita)
I'ma show you where we're heading
And I'ma show you where we're heading
Enoch, Elijah, Emmanuel
Hero Emmanuel
Hero Emmanuel
Bring his captives home
Bring his captives home
Bring back the remnant of Israel
Bring back the remnant of Israel

I heard the missile go ""Ka-boom""
Saw the clouds like a mushroom
The whole planet in such doom
The Egyptian's opened up King Tut's tomb
Kawasaki went ""Vroom""
My spirit outta body
Nail Cheselden Anunnaki, Godly
Eloi, Eloi, ah, Eli, Eli, rise
Seven plain, the unexplained
I don't change
Their continents were like lightning
The pyramids were like the Mayans
Beyond the Orion
Star followed by the Three Wise Men
Flying in the spiritual Zion
The Constellation showed the lion
The dawn to the horizon - their eyes on
And the angel has said ""come with us
You need rest, where there's no height, no depth
There's no weeping, nor-no death
Nor-no bone, nor-no flesh
No blood, nor-no sweat
Can't enter all except thy Holiness""

There's no weeping, nor-no death
Nor-no bone, nor-no flesh
No blood, nor-no sweat

So when I write my heart, that emulates life
All heights and all depths
Large nations and small sects
Standing ovation for old texts

Who wrote the Bible or the Holy Qu'ran
While the pictures show 9 Templars holding arms
Crusade wars assumed their cause, produced their swords
The Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want
I called to the heavens, through Hell I walk
Humming the hymns within, salvation from a foul nation of sin
Genesis 10, how the races begin
After clouds brought this place to an end
Crowds of people occupy the spaces again
Eve children, weed building from the same tree that killed 'em
And Adam became a dragon, he said that he was from Saturn
He rubbed a lantern within his tavern
He came to build pyramids within the villages
Put up statues but it wasn't in their images
He say they built it from the top down
Mysterious circles found within the crops on the ground
His hand pointed slowly show his teeth was all black when he smiled
His garments smelled of myrrh but couldn’t hardly understand the word
Malnurtured but he bowed when he worshiped
And it seem that he shout a loud verses
And between 3rd steps he lift his hand and said, “Bless”
He take a bite of this plant and recycle a chant
His voice would get lower then he was sort of in a trance
Then he extend his hand and gave me the plant
As soon as I touched it, with this mind he instructed
I could be corrupted or abducted
I ate, I felt dusted, I started bugging
All of a sudden I saw the destruction and the reconstructions
I walked on fire and talked to Elijah
Saw empires implore their writers and reward their fighters
Kings that wore the hoards of tigers

Art imitates life
So when I write my heart, that emulates life
All heights and all depths
Large nations and small sects
Standing ovation for old texts

A glass of water, a tank for all
Carry the blood in a pit of fire 
Under my pits of wire, strapped with bombs
The whole world is gone, see you in the sequel reborn
A wise man said we're dying in dread
Children won't last, chemical gas
Save the world, difficult task
Hollywood is much different from a Cali hood
Burn down the government? I probably would
Me and my Annunaki army is good
Even the mantis prays twice and once a day
He keep his arm folded just in case he forget
And even a snake praise His name when he hiss
Dance with the Devil so I had to split

Developing Story, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013.0,"Ayo, turn that TV down
Here is fifty thousand dollars, let's do this
I want him dead, nah mean?  Don't even worry about it
You going to take him out? Yeah

Amongst the heat busting
Weed functions, street discussions
A fleet's coming! Niggas keep hustling
One rushing, his head blooded, his eyes all wild
The night sky had a devil-like smile
Rain, lightning stabbing at the earth
Which takes us down to an area where murderers lurk
And burglars search through bottomless pockets
All alone apartments, a place well known,  controlled by crime and convicts
A place we all familiar with, it's called the projects
Now take a look at the scene, that's in progress
A black Chevy slowly brewed around the block
Holding four killers with loaded up Glocks, they scoping the spots
Their eyes were gouging the city housing, for areas least allowed in
More less, least the crowded
From the distance heard police sirens, quickly faked the silence
The night's air became every thug's greatest challenge
Each assassin wore the face of violence
They found the spot, then they docked
Each killer leather missed they mark, they quietly submarined around the park like a shark
Bestowed through the dark
Four hooded shadows, high against the crack wars in war apparel
These outlaws travel
Eight silent, creaped upon the back of the lobby door
When on the other side lays all kinds of war
Nines and razors, guns galore, ones with lasers
Cooking strangers, look at danger
Gangsters and gamblers, Hustlers are servicing customers
Murderers and grandmothers, smugglers and grams and others
Blocks away, the noisy street murmured
They took out their burners, perfect time
Their mood was fact, murder
They spot two, they crack workers
Playing games of chance, they quickly advanced
They stalked cat-like. Ass tight amongst the crack pipes and scattered dice
The lobby domino with stairs, a vague trace of weed fumes hung in the air
Each heart played a game of truth or dare
Eyes surveyed the place, for a familiar face, and traps
Each clutching they gat, cause everybody strapped
They spotted the hit, eyes were fixed, let the other three knows this was it
A smile twitched, ghost-like, at the corners of his mouth, before he shot the dude name out. The kid slid out
He crouched as he squeezed the trigger
In a sudden all types of death, and bleeding niggas
Bullets hissing, like locked snakes
Hands suddenly stopped on the clock of faith, his body rocked away
Horrific sight, reporters said the grizzy murders, happened last night
Eleven shot, now pronounced dead, bottom beds
From pounds and bread, to rounds of led
Now the soul's dragged down by hounds pulling the sled

Sisters started free-basing
Brothers stop the self-hating
We need some reevaluating
Some growing up, stop the handout
Stop holding the cup
You think we was old enough
Peep these jewels while you're rolling your dutch
Brothers having a form of godliness
But disregarding their kids
What kind of God do you think you is?
Man you are how you live
Yeah, you know 1-20
But he has a home in the city
Reason why you're on the phone from Poughkeepsie
We follow every rely-on
Put it together, we free our mind storms
Brainwashing, CBS is watching
Television Evangelist grants you a wish
Their modern therapist for the devil's pit
Designs for the ghettos to fit
On the top of the federal list
Now tell me who hell is this?
Rebels throw up your fist

We all born sinners
On the corners with them law offenders
To get it all is a core agenda
Everything is real, no false pretenders
But while days pass, time flies
Minutes flash, the mind dies
Bigger graves, New York Times
Chalk lines, the thought's blind
Prices on your enemies head
Cause nowadays dudes got bread to make you disappear
So that goes for your fist in the air
Angela Davis or Jesse Jackson
Affirmative Action, you burn or the casket
Let your moms know before you go
Ghettos the ball in the chain, it's all the same
And heron spoon fall into flame
Right before it dissolve in the vein
We're scared to read the scriptures
Cause they don't act like your niggas
But even the Messiah will crucify between two thieves
They come for me spray Uzi's
(Reporter)
Excuse me Priest?
Priest can I talk to you for a minute?
My name is Tiffany from Stained Glass Television
Can I ask you a question about the Black Market Militia
And your beef with the industry?

Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing,Best of Killah Priest & A Prelude to the Offering,2008,"Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Just not need a friend, now I yearn it every day
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Was it the blind then, the blinded goat, then follow the pig
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Jus not need a friend, now I lurk in the gutters (Watch this!)
If you blind then, the blinded goat and then follow the pig

Since the dawn of day, men be usin they minds
To do, wickedness, but ain't nothin changed
My God, things are still the same
So I got on my knees and prayed
Lord, oh Lord, above, shine on us, your previous love
That is what we need today, that our flocks won't go astray
Cuz some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing

Shock waves...
Now after survivin brothers connive and some smoke the lie
Sendin vibes like they shocks, I recognize
Then inspect the eyes when I detect the lies
I analyze standin wise in my enterprise
I judge wisely, as if nothin ever surprise me
Loungin between elevators and lobbies
Pockets knotty, full of Bills like Cosby
Smooth as Isley's, Brothers
No time for lies in your alibis
This style'll have you die, evil multiply
The snake slivers, plus the bite is bitter
They play you like the fiddler
The truth makes you sicker, June 4th put me on cause
351 bought off the third son, the rain drives plate of drums
I use the truth to overcome, a soldier from the slums
Call Solomon, Rudy is like a ruby to me
Zaria is like a sapphire, teach her daily
Words are clearly, yearly come near me
I prepare thee for the future, future
Tribulations and liberation, for ya nations
Killah Priest keeps it deep, plus the slogan
Wolf in sheep clothing

Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing

Shock wave ... shock wave!
I face the east in my place of peace
And wicked men divide sin
They have a zil, but lack the will
So they kill rather then build, a fed
Too many brothers die, while the mothers cry
And in the White House, are names are being wiped out
I got the right route, I hold a tablet, control the savage
Like I'm Moses, brains thick as water hoses
Starve the devil like a bed of roses
And use dogs to sick 'em, while the TV noise will trick 'em
Exploit our victims, while the rich applauds the system
But I'm the sheep in wolf clothing, only feats if the hoofs cloven

A Crying Heart,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"(Priest talking)
Yeah, yeah, my name is Priest
You know what it is man
Here me out there world
What you got on this man?
Big time we gotta get it
What's over there? I go it
Lock that, Priesthood, knaw'mean?
It's real son, it's real son
(Hook) Priest
I only fucks - with - what's - real

Let he who have sin, sin no more
Tired of kicking in doors, shootouts,, blood and gang wars
Chainsaws, tied up spouses, cocaine laws
Hawaiian outfits with SKs that bloodstain walls
Till you're losing ounces, niggas see the life that drug game calls
You're crying fountains on the calls, saying, ""Please, she's only four""
Pleading the merciless men that murder your kin
Sending you threats over the phone and they murder again
Now you either make the payments or funeral arrangement
Contemplating, federal building put their name in a statement
Poor choices, take this like the gem from the pearl of oysters
Still wet on my tongue, rep where you're from
And your boy just see real niggas respected
Deliver this message to the dumb and the deceased
We all from the streets, made they rest in peace
While I wreck this beat with techniques
Resurrect speech with flows are deep in soul
I tell Ms. Rahman, I'm sorry what happened that evening
But it was Tone; his name came up now we even
And Mr. James I wish I could change, but Todd
Shouldn't of did what he did, you can't blame Rob
And Ms. Stevens, what can I say? A close call
But it wasn't me you visit at the morgue
When they killed Spark that night, my heart went to the right
My chest got tight, that was a hard one to fight
Hood mysteries that no one could figure out
Plain and simple, facts were there
Going through packs of beer
Make me run to the roof; let the Mac off in the air
You was always strapped, gave me dap then threw up the pairs
Like yeah, I missed those years, I dish out tears
Strange dreams at night make me wish you was here
Tommy you should have watched your back
Instead he let them niggas plot and then form an attack
His shots echo, bounced off the building in the ghetto
Mass genocide, inner-city children of the borough
And Mr. John, I did what I did cause of revolution
You're damn near sixty, may you lay next to Newton
The dollar bill, ""In God We Trust""
Does God stand for Guns, Oil, & Drugs they gave to us?
(Hook) Priest

Its project living regardless revolvers are spitting
When drama is lit, ganja get clipped, the mission
No bottles with ribbons, just hollows from Henchmen
Hell swallows us, death follows up
Bullet shells, toddlers get bucked
Black male role models are fucked
The little girls promised the world but tomorrow turn sluts
You either playing basketball or pushing crack in the hall
Or either rap or getting macs out the board
Now what's that, white supremacists?
No rights for immigrants (no rights)
Life imprisonment, some get life sentences
Secret indict, wife swapping with businessmen
We fight militant, deep as the words they're writing Genesis
Black paintist Rome-like the images
This goes to the judges and the sentences

My Life,Priesthood,2001,"My life, though things may seem hard
My life, I know I can depend on God
My life, things might not always go right
My life, but at the end I'll see a bright light

So many types of women, a life that I was livin'
The clubs, the thugs, the nights that I would give in
It didn't feel right in my system but I was with 'em
Trying to fight the feeling but I was just like a victim
Caught up in the rhythm of dough I was spendin'
Drinking down venom, the bacardi and lemon
The bartender grinnin', the party's just beginning
And I was sent into it, it was probably endin'
I mean the stars, the cars, the cards that you charge
To the brauds that you meet at the bar, it's all a mirage
I even ignored my true calling from God
Hid like Jonah in the club with bottles of corona
Surrounded by models and owners, and cronic smokers
The ones that you find in a coma, play the corners
Gun holder sprayed the foreigners
But today I'm no longer, much stronger
Witness my song, cuz

My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means alot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes alot to turn a player around
My life, especially in the playa moment when he lays on the ground
(In my life)

Taking straight shots of liquor, leave a spot on my liver
Bustin' shots at my niggas praying cops come quicker
Cuz the life I got, somethin' not to live for
My kid's 4' 5"", and 12, surviving hell
My nigga Boog died in jail, the rest of my niggas crying bail
Laying in an iron cell, I tried going to church
But it seems like the Pastor keep molding a verse
Until my mom go in her purse
The Lord knowing I search, I needed therapy
My heart's beating heavily, I'm seeking heavenly
For the rest of me, my man says stay weeded, that's the recipe
Until the cops arrested me
My destiny is to leave a legacy, I don't have much
But if the Lord credit me, you'd see the best of me
I found a new life the day within the Bible page
While the popcorn's in the microwave, I hop on a tidal wave
I'm being stress free, I can do it if you let me
If I'm wrong then correct, or it just could be
Or it just could be

My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means alot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes alot to turn a player around
My life, especially in the playa moment when he lays on the ground
(In my life)

Since this record is nearly over, bring the song to it's closin'
Jahova, lights that novas over life and cultures
I'm seein' nights turn solar, ultra brightens the globe up
I roll up to niggas with no luck, slow bucks
Spent, hold up, silly cops coppin' doughnuts from bakeries
Shootouts awaken the seeds, D's chasin' the thieves
In projects hoping to receive large checks
For their children, police and the mayor chillin'
While they're the biggest villians of them all
I'm building with the children by the mall
I hear the rumors saying ""Priest be on some other shit
Trying to unite the bloods and crips""
To show 'em how to overthrow this government
I start spazzin', talking about the mothership
Throwin' off my publicist and start talking about the Hebrew covenant
While I'm still thuggin' it, I keep it real, that's why they lovin' it
In my life...

My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means alot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes alot to turn a player around

Drama,Elizabeth,2009.0,"The journey, peninsulas, states of a cruel emperor
Pay your tax or axes from the Knights Templar
The Anglo-Saxon of rapping, for me it gets extraneous
Men to trust, put your ear to my paper while my pen discuss
The silent fall of a righteous kingdom, the cries of freedom
The scare speech of the boy king, would the crowd receive 'em?
The nervous Senator, would the people believe 'em?
The government getting dressed ready to deceive 'em
The lost and found, let us bury treasures in the ground
Empires sack, behead 'em with the crown
The Wilson sisters all of 'em drowned
The picture shows the image of a man leaving the swamp towards an old Church
That said, where ghost ones haunt
The kid writing his lyrics guided by spirits
God like appearance in armor, so light ya ganja
The persona of the music is horror
When I write it's an honor, it conjures drama...
It conjures drama... (echo)
Drama... (echo)
It's drama... (echo)

I came back to where rap was first persecuted
Made merciless music, more ruthless with murderers influence
But with a smooth kick, that  a church boy can groove with
So light up the L's, I build thunder in the skies over Hell
And the oceans for the lost souls to go in
When a hot coals take over their skin
The Omen's approaching, one Savior, one slogan
One prayer, one potion
I'm in his layer, the slayer, here comes this goatman
What type of life is this for a made star?
My A&R wishes to see me in the graveyard
The president of rap music put me in his radar
Hire goons to start shooting, but I'm a quasar
Priest is smarter, if we kill him, he'll just be a martyr
My leg kneel, better take words aligning my chakras
Tried to get me like Michael Jackson
A disciple of rapping, lyrics spin and slide
We'll walk a psycho with passion
Comma, contrast, Contra, dondra
Drugs, llamas, tundra, it's drama...
It's drama... (echo)

The beast within eat at my skin
Come out of my flesh, break through my neck
But what? The beast has something lurking in him
It searches through his limbs, it tears through his fur
It glances at the Earth, but what lies inside of it is something worst
It comes out of his hooves then runs in the woods
Holding his stomach cuz his lungs feel full
Than it howls like the wolves it burst open
Here comes the shogun, I saw the piece to show men
He's golden, deep, speaks words exploding
Black ho's are born, wind-pool's form
Meteor storms, Mars grows corn
Monster man throw blows than grows horns
My words are tetrahydrocannabinol
Your brain's the sword, I plant in you all
Chew feel the mouth like cannon balls
I shoot at ya insanity walls
All ya vanity, humanity falls
It's just some thoughts for the marijuana
Just some payback for your comma
A shell to protect your armor
I just call it drama....
Drama... (echo)
It's drama... (echo)
I just call it drama
Drama... (echo)
I write drama
What made 'em write like this?
It's drama... (echo)
What made 'em make beats like this?
What makes 'em rock like this?
I hold the mic like this! What!?!
It's drama... (echo)

Goodbye,Black August,2003,"Uh.. Black August
Good Morning America
It's Killah Priest back at ya
I'm feelin' good tonight, uh-huh
Priesthood, Big U in the house, SoulStice
We gon' do this, stay focused
Yeah, I feel it, uh-huh
Yeah.. yeah, yo, yo

The mouth and tongue of Malcolm
Tellin' my publicist, fuck this government
Go 'head and rate my album, this is the judgment
Vacate the island, billions will start wildin'
The feelin' of violence will have trillions in silence
Or watchin' the news, Arabs against Jews
They bombin' the schools, political fools
Liberal move, is all confused, gun users
Instead of peace talk, fuck this world
I ride for Z. York, pass the heat off
I blast at Farahkhan to overthrow Babylon
Fuck this world, that's why we carry on
By the Email Fidel, tell him meet me on the D.L
No longer a free world, think of shank or Verra'
This be the days of terror.. SoulStice

Oh shit, amazin' grace, how sweet the sound
Savin' slaves, for another body found
Bound to the streets where we drown if we sleep
We make heat instead of peace
Struggle to eat, and breathe
On Shiek metal swords before we eat
To teach, shake my head in disbelief
41 shots, a young brother deceased
Gunned down by police, is there no justice, no peace?
So fuck the police, listen, I walk with P
Ignorance leaks like back streets of sickness
Or disease, and our weakness, we bleed
Deceive to believe in this modern Eden, we thieve
Conceive through this belly, we beasts
Ninety thieves stalk woods for Priest
Leave out this laws of Camenites
We strive to rise like height
But through hate we over-weigh our fate
And fall like meteorite, to spread the self-sacrifice
Instill like these parasites, in birth rights
Prescribe a mind of 360 degree fahrenheit
In the dark like midnight, these words I recite
I once was blind but now I..

See the light..
Freedom fights in prison, sprung from religion
Taught by elders, the system failed us, no one to help us
Priest and his Priestess. We sit on thrones judging Egypt
Peep the eclipse, the shadows cover the moon
The Devils govern the fools, they stubborn as Jews
Pearls before swine, I quiz them, they need more time
Seek the wisdom, free your mind
From the cobras, it's Priest and SoulStice
We came to teach the culture
We can stand the heat like vultures
Open ya wings, the soul of a King
Song of a Queen, dawned with the rings
Bow and kiss 'em, if he's a fraud than strip 'im
From all this badness, greet him with daggers
We more than rappers, we the masters

Even after.. World War 3, the war of intelligence
The court, self-defense is common sense
Third corridors and drug stores
Immensely spokes and leave scars of no evidence
Dense minds outlined in chalk, the refined walk
Can rise again like cocks, a resurrection at box
Religious, intravenous, take my name in vain
Clinically insane, hold secrets
Mentally slain for their repentance by the government
Hold the third commandment, who's the man sent?
Modern Lazurus, hands wake the nation

It's revelations, I'm takin' medication, my head is achin'
I've been buying weapons since the 11th
Stars and stripes vs. a star and crescent
God's blessin', be a soldier, I gotta speak out on Oprah
I'm Under Siege, I grab my gun and fatigues
Plead my woman and seeds, hundreds shall bleed
I speak blunted from weed
Do y'all really want peace or y'all wanna see war?
Crates of candles or crates of C4
Why they rich and why we poor?
If he Jacob do that make him Esaw?
Is Colin Powell really Bush as Igor?
Why did terrorist attack the entire Eastern seaboard?
Who taught the men to kill theyselves?
They're received Allah's rewards, we need to read more
Priest, I rap with razor blades on the side of each jaw
In the millennium, war against Palestinians
A century is done, plenty of guns
Plenty of bombs, many shall come
And my name, a homeless man ridin' a train
Day and night, leavin' my head with migraines
It's the atomic age, we either smokin' chronic or sage
The blood of Jesus, Decepti-concept
Martin Luther King had a dream
Gun shots create a smokescreen
We throw on concrete, I wear a bandana like the Panthers
Back to court with my handgun

It's real as the masonic seal on a dollar bill
Conspiracy theories that got Kennedy killed
Or the secret governments, Blood and Crip
Worldwide, look at the future through your third eye

Everythin', strugglin', comin' up
That's why I'm writin' to myself right now

Gotta make this come up, man
Get that dough, do these shows
Up late in studios
Tell all these groupies no
Not right now, gotta write down
My life on paper, again
Spend the night with gangsters
Spend the night with strangers

Feel the slice from a razor
In my hood, niggas fight 'til they make up
Shoot dice 'til they blaze up
Po-nine come and chase us
Through the streets, feel the slice on our faces
So many nights in the cages
So many fights, outrageous
Niggas pullin' out gauges
Bullets flyin' outrageous
Better run, better duck, hit the pavement
I'm outta luck, backed up by my payments
Patience, runnin' out
I'm all alone, with the gum in my mouth
Pacin', back and forth
I'm on the phone with my son and my spouse, thinkin'
Of good times, jot down hood rhymes
From the tour-bus to the corners, it's torture


Feels like I'm in danger
Paranoid, slip one up in the chamber
Had the gun in The Rain
Cuz'of the pain, I'm a thug, do you blame us?
I came up through the gang stuff
On the train with the chain tucked
Rings and a King Tut'
Three-piece suits and a clean cut
On a job search, better not get robbed first
Situation gets a lot worse
Percipitation is hard work
Lost youths, no-one to talk to
Sixteen-years old just jumped off the roof head first
Could be the network

Another beer that's spread on the earth

For the wake, for the snake, for the cake glist'
Know bitches that make wits
For the sake, the grape, the rape and the fake tits
Speed it up 'fo the jake hits
No time for baked bits
Make hits, write down where the lake sits
From the blocks, take trips to the lines, to the flake glist'
Ride around in the '86

Let the Earth bring forth grass
The herb yield seeds, the fruit fall from trees
Working daily are the honey bees
Then all kinds came abundantly
And everybody in the jungle free
But times change, now it's guns that squeeze
Crime family smuggle ki's
USA is a large company ran by quiet societies
Privately the hood diaries of Brooklyn killers in the '80s
Harlem was heaven, project legends
Supreme had Queens; the Bronx was repping
Then the west Coast let go
With gang-banging, the game changed then
With ""Batman"" and Raymond Washington
The streets in Watts begun
No cops will come, what block you from?

Our ancestors brought from Africa on slave ships
Now return in the air in first class trips
Passenger six, window seat, relax I'm viewing the fish
The trees, the seas are blue like the jewels on my fist
From the islands of Costa Rica we share that same light
Children play with marbles of gold, return the plight
We share the same light; we share that same life

We weren't enslaved 'cause our color
Look in the Bible page and you'll discover
The real reason why we suffered
We fit the prophecies in Deuteronomy
They took the true Jewish colonies
And brought 'em to a new economy
Through Willie Lynchings philosophies and brutality
And through poverty we lost numerology
Once in tuned with the galaxies
No we only see using weed astrology
We took up a blunt culture
Lost memories, last night fights from being hungover
Young soldiers become sober
Deuteronomy 28, verse 28 will set the record straight
It states that he will struck us with ""madness and blindness
Confusion"", no power or refinement, no movement
Now take a look around at our environment
Drugs supplying, guns firing
While the president is hiding
And we admire them, white police patrol there
But they don't leave near
So they don't care who gets killed here
Or confined to a wheelchair
Our ignorance made them billionaires
Verse 29 says we will be exploited on our long voyage
Unemployment for their enjoyment
No longer called the anointed
But coons, niggers, and spooks
From Bojangles, Jiggas and Snoop
These deuteronomic codes expose
Our dishonouring roles
Verse 30, I will send you and your king
To a nation that neither you or your fathers have known
The valley of dry bones

Our ancestors brought from Africa on slave ships
Now return in the air in first class trips
Passenger six, window seat, relax I'm viewing the fish
The trees, the seas are blue like the jewels on my fist
From the islands of Costa Rica we share that same light

About it man?

We live like crows and a hermit, searchin for a higher learnin
The fire's burnin, lightnin bolts comin down
Hittin both coasts, leavin niggas comatosed
That's why I wear the chrome close
And we'll all meet the omen in the moment of most
Runnin in churches with my gun, I'm nervous
Disrupt the service, ask the pastor, ""Where do I worship?""
My life is worthless, I done seen so many nights and murders
The enemy stuck a knife in Curtis
I wake up in cold sweat, grab my Tec, I'm hopeless
All my homies pullin on roaches of foul coaches
Or loud explosives, return to the hood like the child Moses
A bastard in a basket, my gat spit
Till the palbearers close the casket
And that's it, the end of the chapter
The beginnin of the next one
The resurrection, imperfection, after death come
The black son in the ghetto section
The light protect them from the iron weapon
This is madness...

This is madness, this is madness...

Mystic night beneath the cherry moon, we rarely move
Peace to the ghetto nation, three million population
Guns poppin Satan, feel our feather wings
Eloheim as we bury kings
Our fathers pumpin garbage in their blood streams
The novel of Apollo, every thug thing
Blood, money and cancer inside a dope fiend
My hungry team sellin drugs, Verazine got me feelin buzzed
Ghetto breed felonies, my niggas face the judge
The witness tryin to place his mug, the D.A. tryin to taste his blood
And the lawyers is the court employers, showin fake love
The court system is 33 and 1 third of a mace and club
While niggas is still beefin and tradin the slugs

Who's to blame? I hear cats callin my name
Sayin, ""Please, don't fall in this game!""
We're all in a gang
It's like the ghetto, got me trapped with a ball and a chain
To them crack rocks I swallow, absorbed in my vein
Nightmares of bein shot, record in my brain
My neck and soul dropped and fall in the flames
Every night I wanna roll a Dutch, scared to sober up
I'm like a bird in the cobra's clutch
I'm like a bird in the cobra's clutch
This is enough...


You bought this Proverb baby!
Every day I hear violent screams outside my window
I see black hurses followed by limos
On your forehead I see the devil's symbol
3 6's, do the arithmic of the witches
And Grand Wizard, can you withstand the blizzard?
I see prophecies unfold that was told by the prophets of old
Looked up, I saw the clouds in Heaven roll
Back like a gigantic scroll
UFO's came down to damage the globe
3 rolls, saw the lamb with blood on his robe
While the beast shove us in stoves
And the government swallow our souls
I'm gettin drunk of a wild Irish rose
My brain's haunted, roll with much pain and torment
A fire like Elijah that came with the warnin
Bodies bein carried at the sound of the organ
Saw the skeleton, the rider of the Four Horsemen
Pull out my dick, chop off my foreskin
Take the blood and write down my four sins
On the side of Satan's coffin, I see angel's corpses
I start to gettin nautious from demonic forces

The great blunt cloud
Drift through his dark cold nostrils
While intoxicated thoughts fly like jets through the weak storms
We calm with Hennessey, written on the side
Picasso, my art flow, my flow never dies
Eyes Wide Shut with sluts, I fucked them, in all positions
Leave nuts on their chins in menage et troises, blase blah
Lord forgive our soul as it drifts through the infinite hole
The judgment, the covenant
I speak on subjects from a thug's death
Devils with pitchforks lift the corpse from the eternal fire
I sit across the mother and the messiah
The holy one told me to come
Outer body experience, not worried, released or tense
Now I'm in a dark age, periods, but curious
A knight in the night on the black horse while bats cross my face
Lost my way, wearing nothing but satin cloths
Rats eating at my face, I take my gats off the waist

The Earth spins in (circles)
The smoke rings go in (circles)
The energy flows in (circles)
The clock flows in (circles)
The Earth spins in (circles)
The early morning wind's in (circles)
Smoke rings in (circles)
Energy flows in (circles)

West Philly really on that you can quote me
In Arizona, homey, 
I hoo-dance with the Hobey
I leave the track smoking until the great circle is broken
Everything is copacetic and cosy, but uh...
The galaxy is governed to certain emotions
Whether in a cypher getting right with your old friends
Or tight fit, nice whip on some chrome rims
Or flipping bricks big enough to fit Stonehenge
What goes around comes around then revolves
It's called karma, yes, the universal law
From The Last Em', Jamal, dominating overall
Still shining like the wheel that Ezekiah saw
It was a circle, life and death meet in the streets
Form a circle, ionic particles of heat
They come in circles, now our cypher is complete
In a circle, Last Emperor and Killah Priest

This is.. hot raps that'll impact ya chest
Everything in motion comes to rest
Even the condor builds his nest
Then a plasma plaque or patch to the west

2Mex hip-hop opera part two, plot part deep, part copra
Unstoppable, cops just popped Hoffa
Now there's no stopping of the blood to mop up
Still burn, Children of the Corn still crop up
I'm as revolutionary, had the flu shot
You motherfuckers still living in the blue shot
The solution, to control the whole of the soul
Of the loose gun, man in the trance, translucent
The ones, some of the pawns, send the militant hunts
And then there's the haunts
Around the necks of your uncle and your aunts
The renaissance of the science, and the sonnets
The sauna of the mind switch, defiance in the sonics
The age of enlightenment and the dawn is upon us
Even in the age of electronics they still warn us

The Sun moves in a circle
My aura glows in a circle
The spaceship is a circle
You can't touch my inner circle
Your black eye is a circle
The gunshot is a circle
This wedding ring is a circle
And everything is a circle (X5)",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-circles-lyrics
Confession Booth,Elizabeth,2009,"I split atoms, crack codes, took rap to a plateau
Did everything with words but never got the plaque yo
Big Pun won best ""Rap of the Year""
I gave 'em dap, we both cheered
Said I shoulda got the ""Rap of the Atmosphere""
Pun showed me love, both of our missiles were scuds
By the time Nas talked that pistol and glove
By the time Pac was official the Thug
He showed me love, he told me his favorite was...
Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth (B.I.B.L.E.)
He told me he loved GZA's verse
I just took it and smirked
RZA was convinced I had something powerful
Rhymes full of rocket fuel, put me on the 'Gravediggaz'
Got mad when I ain't spazz on the lyrics
Fuck it, give that one to Bazz
I never had feelings
Knowing what I could do with the #2 pencil
Knew I was invincible, I pretend to play cool
Told Ra I didn't really want it
I was cool just being a fan; ""Liquid Swords"" was coming
Judge wisely, Basic Instruction, my introduction, it's on

I signed to Geffen, my girl got pregnant
My mind's the weapon, designed as a message
Implemented my life lessons
What sparked ""Heavy Mental"" was very simple
Its what I been thru, nothing to pretend to
When GZA snatched me, I was looking like one of the Isley's
Staff beside me, braids, never grew a beard, looking weird
But when I write Brooklyn disappeared
I sought thru seven stratospheres
God idea's, assault rhymes
The last thru millennium years
Him and RZA claimed me up, Tray gave me my first cut
I use to kill rappers used to lay in the cut
I traded the bucks from breaking them up
Gave me Mathematics on top of Israelite books
When I rap the underground shook
Met a foe, Canibus, now I can admit
That when we battled we was throwing planets
I was shocked for no man could withstand a gigantic gift
We met later as 'Horsemen', we begin to talking
Bring Ras Kass from a whole another orbit
Kurupt, beat them beats up, now the 'Sunz of Man'

Like all great crews, the things we gon' go thru
Just a part of the music biz, we all paid dues
Problems with egos and listen to too many people
Yesterday that's your man, tomorrow it's legal
The thing that bugged me up we was just getting started
Barely finished the project
To be honest I didn't appreciate y'all picking Priest to be the target
Everything said in darkness came out of the closet
Though I never shouted out a comet cuz I'm out in the cosmic
So in my house there's conflict
I got the brothers their first deal
Kat Jones was the backbone of just keeping it real
Shabazz left, P and Razah was cool
Me and 60 was old school
Marvin Gaye tapes, Stevie Wonder greats
Al Green the moments, Earth, Wind & Fire remakes
But than when shit didn't work out
Brothers blamed the Clan
Man, we had to stand up and be our own man
It wasn't the Clan fault that we was at a halt
It's because brother didn't wanna revolt
I wanna chill, make more music
But than here we got with this deja vu shit, plain stupid
But we still all brothers, it's all love, I have no doubts
Cuz every other day... the sun might come out",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-confession-booth-lyrics
Sword Clan,Elizabeth,2009.0,"The path of peace, the Jedi saga continues
Gangster, ganja and criminals
He drinks his white tea, olefine
Brain chemicals and out of God is identical
He takes it to the pendulum, since his pen begun
The super saying in the youth of great men
He was slaying, he start praying, ate men
Galactic Guardian rap, what you charging for tracks?
I wear my heart and my axe, my art is black
I'm like a character out of Marvel
We are DC, old model, he's remarkable
Between two pillars of marble
Delta Probe One, the ShoGun
A bow tongue, then throw raps like daggers for fun
Y'all try to get me, all y'all from toy land
Y'all Milton Bradley brands, all y'all stance
I'm coming for the hood Grammy, along with my sword clan
Along with my sword clan...
Along with my sword clan...

A dark side, seeing when it's dark skies
He wears the disguise, the lotus flower buds
I'm taking his blood, a power from above
Bow down, cross my legs, Indian style
In a pow-wow, the thunder dance
Meditate, talk to Magneto and Professor X
Y'all world's last chance
Telepathy like from the mind of Stan Lee
My strength in the comic world is like family
Your pix sticks of style of rap is weak
Try another technique, the angel and the beast
The seven hundred angles from the priest

I'm the life maker, the life taker
The incubator and the cremator
The ink on paper 'till it extinct to vapor
Trap rappers in my cosmic cube
Fuck Rubix, that dude was a fool
There's a shape that I twist that you never thought exist
Shape-shifter transcend to self-awareness, self-consciousness
Out of me came the beyonder
Stars and planets and continents
Repeat at rapid speed, God doesn't bless the tree
But the seas, the seeds make the roots
The roots make the tree
The trees give off fruit, the fruit give off breeds
That's different juice, the mic give off oxygen
Now y'all can breathe
Golden age, the diamond age
I take y'all to a new rhyming phase
See the heroes in the Halls of Justice
All over the walls with mics and clutches",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-sword-clan-lyrics
Theme Song,Priesthood,2001,"Theme song..

Have you really understood what Priesthood means?
Royal Kings turn fiend chasing hood dreams
Bring it back, it ain't hard as things seem
I speak the facts as the tracks made the hood theme
Have you really understood what Priesthood means?
Royal Kings turn fiend chasing hood dreams

Song of a rose, mass in a tinted window, they play my intro
I walk like I waltz in the road, instrumental
Have a nigga sentimental, statues and monumental
The kind that Ghengis Khan was sent to
Sorta like Islamic temples and castles with demonic symbols
My armors ripped too, Imma spit two
The promise that I give you to the virtue that's on my garment
I'm Godsent, my right hand raised, I'm honest, pay homage
I lay in garbage with the hiphoppers, ya'll think about it
Theme song
Chorus

When King Tut closed his eyes, I opened up mine
Felt the pulse in my spine, I choked and I whined
I was sent here by God to bring hope to my kind
First words was a note I spoke in a rhyme
My album'll touch you like the death of Malcom
Comes in CDs, cassettes, internet, and volumes
I was raised by a certain column on my info
I know the CIA got 'em, they want me to stay at the bottom
But I rise to the top, why not? my Glock, spies watch
But they can't do me nothing, because we kings
This my theme song, and this is how I sing
Theme song


Preach the novel, sit upon a seat of marbel, teach the Gospel
Street apostle, found my name engraved deep in fossils
I spray bullets at you, eat your hollows
Make it hard for you to even swallow
You be that way until you reach Diablo
Bet your family's gonna weep tomorrow
Ya'll walk the path that the Reaper follows
Sorta like the cat in Sleepy Hollow
Ya'll get wacked, I pack a burner like the heat and charcoal
Build my castle like the Count Draco'
God forbid when I let the gat blow, my hat low
Despite a belief, the trap door, spinning webs with leads
Ya'll get clapped and that's that, with the rap flow

Exorcist,The Exorcist,2009,"Each flavor jolly ranchers
Eight astronauts in space
Analysts suffer from brain cancer
Now they speak backwards
The Earth awaits the center of mass as they arrive
Only to thrive off a human flesh
Santa clause wife breaks her neck
And beaten to death, the Jesus theory was just a hoax
The devil catches The Holy Ghost
From a psalm that the Archangel had wrote
Hitler jerks off on the top of Jezebel's head
Give the children stone instead of bread
Chop off his head, split his body down the middle
I'm like a three year old and your bones are skittles
Riddle, diddle, little, sickle, pistol
Piddle, paddle, rattle, tattle, taboo
The bottle of Vicodin or Oxycodone
Now I see Martians, wavin' ""Hello""
Their arms are long, their teeth are yellow
Pop another gram so I can see the Son of Man
I look up, oh yeah, the Son of Man
Now you see, now you don't
The trick is makin' them believe but they won't
Who killed 2Pac and ODB? Somebody's watchin' me
Paranoid drinkin' Coca-cola
The coffee cup spills over, I grab soda-after-soda
A drive-by shootin' at a weddin', so upsettin'
White gown, rice rose petals, blood spreadin'
Fuckin' then killin', killin' then fuckin'
My brain's empty, my heart feels nothin'
My left side is numbin'
I ask myself, lemme ask you somethin'
Tryna catch my breath while I'm tryna write somethin' so fresh

80 grams of Dilaudid, dopa- troponin
Hydromorphone, my eye's low, I morph into a King
Holdin' idols of the mammoth, gaff mist of stream
A psychedelic, angelic, relic
Used to bind Leviathan's wings
A night perish, his wife's precious
Holdin' his head, slide off his helmet
Lizard face, she drops 'em
Looks around the reptilian race wit long part tongue
My pupils dilate, my brain goes cuckoo
I must annihilate, I leap yoo-hoo
I feel great, a basket full of snakes
Upon the tablets, a long beard, a stone I still scrape
A poem of madness, I shot the devil on Easter eve
Behind hell's walls, you can still hear his wife grieve
She wore white on his funeral
All dead animals came back to life, it was beautiful
Lookin' unusual, a long trench-coat, lookin' grim
Ground hems spend smoke, slightly build posture
It's Priest the Mobster
A sick smile, holdin' his next vic', a small child
Could it be the next Savior?
Look for more millennium flows

Jeshurun,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"We will shine in his presence
The truthful, when we find all his blessings
The power, we shall receive
Yahwu, eternity
The judgment is coming swiftly
The kingdom, the golden city
That mission, fire and brimstone
Freedom, no more hate 'cause our skin tone

What if you found out everything you've been told was a lie
And the only way to find out the truth was to go inside yourself
And no one to provide you with help
Would you reach for that .9 in your belt?
Or go get the rifle from you shelf
Put the barrel to your mouth and blow your own brains out
Or do you want a second to figure this whole thing out?
What if I told you nothing is really what it appears to be
You wouldn't believe me 'cause you a program from reality
Little fluffy bears, little cute lions
Thanksgiving Day, the underworld alliance
Secret societies, the brotherhood system
You can only join as a client
Spy satellite dishes, Christmas, the protocols of Zion
Science they stole from the Mayans
What if you found out the man in the pic
Posing as Jesus was really Cesare Borgia
Would you do some study on that or would you really care?
What if you found out that the United States was a business
That's why they never address the president as the president of America
Would you go in mass hysteria?
But the president of a corp like your boss
Your corp is named United States
Would you unite or separate?
So who's the presidents of Americans?

Glory, we will shine in his presence
The truthful, when we find all his blessings
The power, we shall receive
Yahwu, eternity
The judgment is coming swiftly
The kingdom, the golden city
That mission, fire and brimstone
Freedom, no more hate 'cause our skin tone
It's coming with angels with swords
The fallenshall be my war
For us, Jeshurun
For us, Jeshurun

From ashes to skull and bone
Bone to flesh, back to life, back to breath
Out of the dark came the light
And out of the life back to death
We all gotta go, it's the inevitable
Like the meek humble, good in heart
Inheriting the Merrill Lynch, fuck the sharing
We want America for vacation spot
Gracious opt, mansions in Morocco
Vatos, no more potholes
We sell the pacific, terrific ain't it
Known nation wide we famous for the ink pen paintbrush
Cause animals ain't us
We the royal family, lost tribes in Egypt
Fell victim to the vanity
No different from the cameras we be in
Damaging the man and your sin is the end result
Diminishing even though we need the benjamins
Balance is the key, I'm ready for a dominion y'all
I'm finished man

Glory
The truthful
The power, we shall receive
Yahwu, eternity
The judgment is coming swiftly
The kingdom, the golden city
That mission, fire and brimstone
Freedom, no more hate 'cause our skin tone
It's coming with angels with swords
The fallen shall be my war
For us, Jeshurun
For us, Jeshurun

Glory
The truthful
The power
Yahwu
The judgment
The kingdom
That mission
Freedom
It's coming
The fallen
For us

I Destroyed You In Front of Your Leaders,Planet of the Gods,2015.0,"You an android something that my hands destroyed
The feds built you I'm a push you into a asteroid
Then hole till you turn into the black noise
The super God has no time for you Wrap Boyce
Go head rap about how much money you got
How many guns you shot, how much jewelry you rock
Go head act it ALAN just stand here and WATT
I'm still not impressed The Rhymes mean cruddy special-effects
Now watch the bodies I catch
And I'm a take you apart in the valley of death
Are you a man or robot, open his face just like a post box
Body swell shots a Botox
The beast sit over the city like co-ops
Kids slam dance to Biggie with mohawks
The missiles to Mars attack of the gods
The cat people found the math to the stars
The wizard of Oz The Land of Nod
Noble Drew Ali Master Farad i'm back on my job
My writing is pure de ospa, street opera part film noir
A French movie about gods in war, a Greek lexicon the gout amos                                                                   medieval African poets during the sau
Walking the labyrinth looking for the amethyst
Nuwaupians returning from planet rizq                                                               grad donkey y'all can flee into a Mammoth ship
They called em evangelist plus the philanthropist
In the catacomb Beneath the gravel and stone
Lives'll ruin supercities that battle for thrones
A Pharaoh unknown I'll unravel his bone
I saw a gold microphone in the master of poems
A castle disowned jumped into a time capsule alone
Flew to a current time stood up in a Tabernacle fully grown Build
Rhymes like The old macks old Tex I zone castles with chandeliers
With my enemies hands and ears all over the dome I inhale a universe exhale a super verse that foretold
The coming galaxies and the future Earth i call it my home
The new graffiti is the Kundalini kool herc girls with Wu bikinis
(Chorus)
""I destroyed you in an island called berzerk x8""

The scenery apocalyptic 0 Dialogue just Heroes with firearms
Empires of the gods The fighter from the star
The might of the saw he light a cigar star day cap is long
The MC from the breeze from the Big Bang galaxies
Far as the eye can see the bit range
All hail the man with the swift rain
A scientist with a thick frame destroying the planet
Rappers cliffhang NY they keep dangling
While I crack they rib cage pass me the mic like a hand grenade i'm much different then the man you played
You barely breathing like the last cancer stage
And your rhymes are disturbing
Look how many eight-year-old you have to twerking
And it ain't real when people out here Hurt
Throw on the operating table close the curtains
Face the surgeon whats wrong too many Molly's probably
You got the kids dream about Bugatti's
It's no longer illuminati it's the illuMennazi's
Robot world cartoons of parties
So if a biuld you I'm gonna take you apart
They give you a brain I'm taking your heart
If they build you a wall i'm putting up art
A clud all this nasa David types
Stomp his compressor and megabytes
Take out his conductor destroy his framework
Reactors shut off can't talk his senses are lost
The beast killed the chief of finance on top of a power plant
The towers in France caught signals
Original digital beam from the planet of God
I'm living proof I bet his eyes has sparks
No where to go in the ocean women taiga Shark
Greatest of all time got writers block
He ate the whole rhyme up the finest watch
The type business like quiet professional
Mature but un pure skeptical more vulgar lil older
Chain-smoker the games over he takes yoga I destroyed you

Jacob Never Died,Elizabeth,2009,"From being led through the desert naked and desperate for water
The Lord is my shepherd, destined for order
But we are his sheeple
Protect us from the wolves or lector tryna do us evil
Never read the Bible for survival
All I know is rivals grab rifles
Despiteful, or disciples are God work
I read Proverbs, for knowledge I starve and thirst
Deal with the sun and the moon, and the stars a third
On the curb puffing herb
Nah I puff a verse, get drunk off this word
I observe spiritual things; I've seen Israel in my dreams
Come true as I succumb to, in a lesson what a blessing
Learned from Timbuktu, or King Tut's tomb
In the Just schools, from the Noah to the three sons
This the reason, Shem, Ham, and Japheth
Now open up the tablets the origins from Shem
Peleg, I look in the mirror everyday
Look at ya self; this is what the artist had felt
Solomon dies, his kingdom splits
One tribe take to the sea in ships
The other say near Egypt, occupy the land
Till their grand's had grand's
While on the other hand
The one who said self have a new plan
Forgot the old way of the Lord, the Covenant
The other children grew up in it
To 70 AD the reign of Titus advance crew ships invaded with the army
Weapons and navies, killing women and babies
Causing Solomon's offspring to flee deeper into Africa
After the massacre, they went to Zimbabwe and Mozambique
Seen an ocean fleet that cause commotion on their beats
Where the Roman Priest held us across, lives were lost
That's after the divine force, they quickly desperado to Morocco
Where they developed other God gold, also when Allah rose
Check my bar flows
Were they shocked when Solomon's children shot 'em and killed 'em
Lots of 'em pilgrims
Fought millions of miles under storm clouds
Where they met these peoples calling themselves Indians
Never reminisce, look at each other eyes and forgot when
Prophecies from old, remember you was told
From the voices of the scrolls, lost souls",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-jacob-never-died-lyrics

Hey, lift the bad ears, taste the hell flames
From the luger, sharpshooters marked Lucifer
Packed twin share of bones bones, rock Hair-rab bone
Voice like baritone, misty skies
King and his queen on his throne
Cleanin stones, clean jew-els
Sent by Gabriel from the neck of Emman-u-el
White pearls, that's it, in the oyster shell
Voice excels, Judas upheld
Take videos of my queens pretty toes
Gold slippers, no clothes, my wife's my stripper
You go sister, teeth on my zipper
After we make love, we read scriptures
Then we look at our child's pictures
Priest the livin saga, Masada the beloved

I'm certified rap legend
You gotta love it, Beast the way I hug it
Streets the way I thug it
New shit, Priest exclusive
Y'all niggas is slaves to my music
Y'all must be buggin

Told y'all I was back, yo check this out
I'm like twisted metal with a twisted flow
Twisted mental, twisted halos
Chase the pace O, check my stage show
Played pool with the nine planets
Rack 'em in a Bermuda triangle
The archangels, God singles
Stroked the harp, first one on Noah's Arc
Stayed close to Jehovah's heart
Kicked Street Parables, played the flute
Raised a cobra from the barrel, comb my afro
Souls from Cairo, a slash between the Genius and a man goin' psycho
The right flow, make the night glow

And if they die, I resurrect from one-two checks

With a rapper tied up with a saw to his knees
Wearing a bloody tee, I see, If I'm not mistaken

He's carving his face in, In the dark basement
He's laughing, While rapping, Lightning strike
His scream, He says fucking say my name bitch

Moanin’,Heavy Mentwo (Bootleg),1998,"This goes out, to all the brothers that lost somebody
And all the brothers who got brothers that's locked down
Sisters too...

We'll be moanin' for my peeps, who've got shot down in the street
We'll be moanin' for my brothers who've got locked down in jail
We'll moanin' for my sisters who be constantly abused
Moanin' for the children who the system have failed
Moanin' for my peoples who have die and gone
We trying to be strong, but we know that life goes on

Yo, melodic war chamber, bang ya, 36 styles of danger
Murderous, floating in the midst of perfect strangers
Killarm Saddam we're built with golden arms
Prophesies about the black bomb, we drop, bodily harm
The shot graze ya, who snitched the cops neighbors
Thick crack rocks invade your block major
Spots been taking his time for move making
Mood thugs breaking and leave your styles faking
Cream is the theme of this wicked world we breathing
Scheming whilst dreaming I fantasize a squeezing
Zoning, thinkin' about case I grab the foam in
Blaze off, one to your dome, your left moanin'

I take a walk through the park at night, living the black life
And while I'm stepping over crack pipes, everybody wants to get high
But nobody really wants to die, they only have fun for a season
But for what reason, plus who do you believe in?
They drink forties with they shorties, telling war stories
Some rebel, and some give up glory
And fame is like a game in the streets
(wassup g) Players kicking game to the freaks, crack buildings
Packed with black children, entrepreneurs producing stacks by the millions
The young kids they want rings and things
The buildings is flooded up with fiends
But I stand strong like a black pope
Gazing through the crack smoke
Repent from the pagan ways
I know your mind strays, but just listen to the phrase...

I'm moanin' for my peoples sleeping out in the cold
Moanin' for the youths who try to make it on their own
Moanin' for my peoples starving all over the world
Moanin' for my people who lost they life fighting war
Moanin' for my peoples who have die and gone
We're trying to be strong, but we know that life goes on..
But they'll be moanin', weeping, and crying out for pain
Lord tonight I pray to you, oh when will it end.. they'll be moanin'

Centrality Of Our Mythic Imaginations,Planet of the Gods,2015,"VERSE I
Wonderful lost civilization called the Land of Mu
Supreme life marine animals
Long ago when this planet ruled
A fate speaker, a great leader, a snake creature
That taught from a cave called the holy reef
And divine coral
We're not immortal
Time portal he would preach
The king of grief
'cause they took his peace
He was sad because the prophecies he'll one day meet
And his people
As he falls to sleep in his water cathedral
Then they ordered the evil
VERSE II
Crash landing of extra terrestrials
Nursed back to health by a small sect of Eskimos
Then they taught them that the air can grow vegetables
And the stars that align and you are symmetrical
Held a serpent entwined
Like what you see today used by the medical
Wait Meta Khemet sin
Sumerian I guess, that's the pre-script-ion
Somehow we related to Dolphins
Melaninated though carbon
Then elevated to soverign
They extended their mythic art
With science that can rip physics apart
See my lyrics is art
The scriptures are dark
A Kabbalistic chart
By releasing the captive Messiah
Ten practice in ciphers
Dressed in crimson sacrificial attire
Open the book of legends
The smoke ascend into heaven
The seven spirits descending in seconds
Feeling the frequency of the Phoenix when it's breathing
All the planets and everything living we all in sequence",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-centrality-of-our-mythic-imaginations-lyrics
Music Of The Spheres, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"To the pythagorians, that discovery had a mystic force, they felt that all the regularities in nature are musical
The movements of the heavens were for them, the 'Music of the Spheres'...


As they had bare the Ark were coming to Jordan, and the feet of the priests who buried the Ark were dipped into the brim of the water, so the Jordan overflowed all it's banks at the time of the harvest, that the water that came down from above, rose up...

My brain's the throne of glory
My voice is seven million stories
My slippers walk through space, Gods territory
The Devils mad, he cast hell before me
But I prevail, broke the spell, fortune teller foresees
Black years for you rappers
The aftermath is here
While I recline listen to the Music of the Spheres
I spit above your ears
It's that Angel music
That sky crack, that wormhole, that star acoustics
Let God acque it
Play it, In the Mosque(Mask?) out my mouth is a fusion
No illusion
My cosmic conscious
Coming like a hail of comets
Godly contents
I sit between two universes
Judging every rapper upon the surface
And laugh at them like a circus
Ya'll mad nervous
I wrap a cloud around my dome like a turban
You can't live to see me in person
You just a servant, so now bow and worship
It's the wordsmith... x2


My mic's the microchip
My rhymes are the hieroglyph
From the edge of a spiral cliff
Hurling my rap books to the wind
Like a staff through a tree I cringe(?)
Then get up with a sick grin
The sacrifice
Thoughts are magnetic
I bring down satellites
Forget ya'll earthlings
I spit for the afterlife
Astral projection
My face see inside of paradise
Either ya'll half man pussies
Or ya'll straight hermaphrodites
Parallel worlds
Your bodies I twirl
Then throw ya'll far into the galaxy
Who want to challenge me?
You out of reality
I come down your flight of prayers
As if they were escalator stairs
The death relate is here
Your respirators prepared
I bake myself a cake using the ozone layer
Happy birthday
Blow out the stars in heaven
Get high taking mushroom clouds
Spit bars of Armageddon
The super God of weirdness
Sincere-ness
Share bliss
I spit that heaven & hell, life & death
That here & now, to outer realms
Genesis to twenty twelve
In heaven, what separates good from evil
Is a giant iron curtain
Guarded by a lion with manes of serpents
Priest, the wordsmith


King of kings
Lord of lords
I hold up a gold cup, filled with ???? of rap(?)
Making an acoustic ball
Revealing all
Inside the mother space craft",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-music-of-the-spheres-lyrics
The End Is Coming,Behind the Stained Glass,2008,"Are we speeding up the highways of life?
No hazard lights on, never stopping for gas
Never to think what we did wrong
Those freeway signs say we passed, says: ""Slow Down""
But you on the road now
You see the accident; you figured you'll go around
So without your signal lights on you switch lanes
Into the other dude's path in the past we had big names
Radio on the forecast said there's black clouds and thick rain
Somehow you think of the cat you blasted in the past
""Thick Cash"" was his nickname; we all brought up in hard luck
Elevators with beer bottle and piss stains
Or was it the ice in the mixture of the liquor
That made you sleep with your wife's sister
Or was it the ambulance lights that made you see the bright picture
You wake up; the horn's blowing, the engine running
The next sign up the road reads: ""The End is Coming""
(Hook) Priest
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""

So you put your hand back on the key, you turn the ignition
Taking off at full speed, a rider's ambition
Caught an empty bottle Tequila in the passenger seat
Glance up in the rear view mirror start patting your cheeks
Gotta stay awake, all the alcohol got you falling asleep
All the poisonous toxins your body absorbed in a week
Look in the same mirror again
See all your so called friends sitting behind you
And that remind you
Of all your mother's words that you was blind to
You lose control over your wheel
You begin to swerve beyond the lines and almost blew
Your tires, bad news for the driver
Your heart's racing fast, there's no off ramp for you to get gas
Just a dark crooked path, you pray patrol lights flash
But when you look through the glass your whole life pass
You see a sign up ahead, it's the toll
On the other side is the crossroad
The croak lady smiles, mother something
She said up ahead the accident one miles says:
""The End is Coming""
(Hook) Priest
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""

The forming nature of man was designed as God planned
Till it was destroyed from the fruit from one hand
Then we built a fruit stand
A life reduction, reluctant to get sucked in
Our luck ends in the cuffs to the pens
Then there's a prayer discussions
Angels or devils, tough decision
When an narcotic is doing most of the discussion with us
Thank goodness we came to the status of a relic
Affectionately regarded, it's true
But it's irrelevant to our times
Devilishment fill our minds
And not to glorify it, 'cause I side with the righteous
It brings out life best in abundance
Dice bets up in the hundreds
Gamble with death, the price is set for us to be hunted
But what did the streets do for us?
But kill all of us, the morgue or the bus?
You lose your life or doing life
You decide tonight, 
(Hook) Priest
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""

""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""
(Priest talking)
Just when you grab on to the wheel
When you're driving over will
It's man's will
It's not an actual car wheel
And your drive is what drives you
The motivation, understand that
Understand this road -
That we're up is a crossroads
We have to make a decision
And know ""The End is Coming""
""The End is Coming""

Murdah Murdah at Dawn,Elizabeth,2009.0,"Whaddup, Woool?
Yeah, they don't know nothing about this war shit
It's Priest, nigga! Woool, whaddup?

Test 'em, tear drops, violent times of war
Hell or love? Bones crush silently
Flesh pierced from swords
Heads roll over rose petals
Horse stands on hind legs
Here come the hero, old rebels come in brigades
Nine's sprayed thru champagne bottles
The boy, man and the slave follows
Cartels wave the ammo, no angle's hollows
Apostles drop thru wood floors
The rope on their neck stop their fall
Victory for all
The ghoul, whorish harlots
Above the stars zips
I pan down to the projects
A murdah in progress, it's heartless
Words bounce off the tongue, unload the cartridge
Monsters, the widow beats on they chest
Weaves those killers from the worlds beyond the flesh
Statue stands naked, a ball in his palm
Over the pawn, the silencers whisper murdah at dawn

It goes murdah murdah, kill kill kill
Suicide notes, lines of coke in the bill
Street life, live like a warrior, grab the steel
But you know that the Gods always build

Posted up attractable niggas
Durable guns like action figures
With threats that's loose on they tongues
Destruction with long strath that hang
Gats in they pants
With a stance like they belong in the frame
Eyes scrolling up the blocks looking for cops
Wild niggas holding their Glocks
Gambling niggas blowing they guap
Smart niggas know when to stop
Rechargeable niggas popping up after some years
Did five in the tier
Strong words he let it hold in the ear
So many menus of holes he been thru
Streets continue
Just some jewels for your mental


Amongst the heart that wears coats of larcenies
Arms that squeeze
CAT-Scans a different brands of weed
Gangsters paradise, palms of green
Investigate a murdah weapon
Detective burn his injection
Infected the hood with wide spectrum
No suspects, the rest, just a blood on the dress
Polygraph, analysts took the handprints of death
Lie detectors, scanners in the eye retina
Shootouts with cops fleeing with the cash register
Clouds of letters spell W'A'R'
Bullets shatter the arm
Gunmen lingers, the hood looks like the battle in Nam
Priest look like the Pharaoh turned God

""Surrender, or pay the consequences!""

Against the Spiral Zone!""

Silent Assassin,The Exorcist,2009.0,"A nigga got the call so I'm the boss
I get up, go outside, jumped in the ride
Before I grabbed the wheel and peel, pushed the stick and drive
Checked my steel and slide my gun to the side
Lightning is cut and through the dark skies
Spell and revenge there's hell in my lens
No bumps, black goose fly outta my skin
Teeth pullin' on black gloves over my hand
Tryna hold on to the wheel while I'm drivin'
Only emitted before I reach this Island, so sick I'm smilin'
This gon' end in violence
I taste redemption in the air, that I seasoned wit time
Watch it simmer in the mind, I cool it wit off wit the nine
Better yet I got the M82A1, a sniper's gun, this should be fun
See tomorrow he plans to speak before the Congress
About an Underworld conglomerates
He plans to hold a conference to introduce the microchip
But I got the contract to leave 'em stiff, they ordered to hit
(Hook) 2x
A hit on the Rothschilds
A contract on the DuMonts, the Machiavellian lost files
I want judges, presidents laid down
Before the Order of the New World goes around

There's this house, I wonder where his whereabouts
I circle around this crib like in the form of brewin'
Windows down for the shootin', black shades for the viewin'
Roll ova by a tree then no one can see me
Binoculars around my neck
I sense death and tits in every breath
Murder steps, I see a light come on
Cross you, so nothin' goes wrong
I see a head come in the room, it's a lady holdin' a baby
Mouth open, stick out my tongue, tasted air like I'm so crazy
Then he walks in caution
Walks over looks out his window like he knows
I talk to myself real slow
He's lookin' deep into the trees like he see me
The woman makes a gesture in the back
But he just stares, he knows I'm here

The Vast Bottomless Sleep (Cosmos),Planet of the Gods,2015,"My writing's like sci fi, population of the earth spread wide
Till it inhabited the twelfth planet on the sky
But back down on the land
To kill the Pope and the leaders of the alien tribe
The son of man must find the reptilian hive
Where they hide, the six human beast inside
With six fangs as teeth, six pairs of eyes
Beware of his pride blasphemy is his bride
Wearer of the dragon crown
Sitting in the spirit wagon with flaming bulls pulling him around

I'm from where volcanic ash blotted out the sun
Till the earth begin to freeze
I'm a prisoner from the lost universe
Behold the prophetic MC, they captured beautiful women
Began the mutating 'til they never stop aging
Scientist capture beautiful women
Start the mutating til they never stop aging
But I'm such a prolific writer
What happens if the lady is a martial arts fighter
And mutated to half a tiger and half fire
I'm the wizard from the white Phoenix city
Where Elohims come out crystal frisbees
From the super rap committee
From the future back centuries
Indy lift up veils to unseen worlds
King of tales dark the art has spells
Hundreds of infants with wings
Grey smoke surround my body like ghost
The darkest words I ever wrote
I spit words into a sea
My quotes flow as quick as my eternal spirit

Define the most high beginning
Multiply the living poltergeist in my writtens
Approach solar lights high yellow
Burnt orange and crimson
Dimensions depth width lengths
Gaining strength
Take a glimpse read the glyphs
In the valley of the dark side of the Moon
Through an alley of art lies a tomb",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-vast-bottomless-sleep-cosmos-lyrics
Sanskrit,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"I rise up in the mornin' like a dragon rise up from the forest
Yawnin', fire breath, I flex to stretch my biceps
The dragon stretch his wings, his press plate gleams
From the sunlight it seems and flies up towards the sun
I walk toward my window like my time has come
The dragon turns towards the Earth
I turn towards my verse
I've been writin', a teaspoon of lightning
Turns the meek Priest into a lion
Touch heart like the swordsman cryin'
The dragon flies toward the wizard
I pull out my sword of lyrics
It's like sendin' evil lord of spirits
Absorbin', feel it, the claws grab the wizard's neck
I scribble in my tek's
Priesthood the frozen lord delivers the death
(Hook) 3x
In my Sanskrit
This is my manuscript
Killah rhymes are hand written
Then placed on canvas

Tonight I sleep like a lion
From a war I was tryin'
Pleasant dream of my enemies dyin'
A couple of cuts across my chest and guts
But so what? Under my finger tips
Smeared blood and traces of hair
And chip bone and the ashes of the faith I seared
My dear, my sword breathin' heavy
Tryna catch its breath, tryna digest
The residue of them dead flesh left
Under my boots is rocks and mud blood from troops
And left is small groups
My snore sound like men at war
I lay like a king on the wall
My heart pumps royal blood thru my veins
The type of blood belong to kings
No disturbance, I sleep beneath the Virgin
The Witch Lord's workin', all of y'all my servants
My rhymes have hair, a full body is hard to compare
Entrance of the Viking come near
She eats ya young, y'all wives are hung
She's at the top, she sits on my tongue
(Hook) 3x

This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
Look into my future
King robes, rose pedal's - throne
And all the world's my name's known
And I help create the new non-Heavens
This is my blessing, my mind's the weapon
So come battle, done by a hassle
The Pharaoh, I wear a hat wit the glow attached
Around the universal bowl
And this is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung

Psychic Priestyle,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"The most amazin', my raps appraised them
Priest the made men, as far as rap, my heart been jaded
Carve his face in, mask like Jason
Rock the stars like a bracelet
As far as evil go, I possess Satan
Turn off the lights nigga, quiet the Grand Mason
The first one to approach you, alien invasion
Telescope look at the sun, moon, stars
Of 'KP's engraved in
I'm here but up there is where the rhymes are created
My style hunt niggas like Emily Rose
Plenty of flows
The four-four waist is usually where the semi would go
Unless it's the Uzi and it's a beauty since I broke off his nose
Now it hits more then one when I fire
From the tongue of the Messiah
Y'all rappers are all washed up, throw 'em in the dryer
Nah, I'd rather hang 'em outside on the wire
Y'all rappers must love death
Go against me is like holdin' ya breath
Bullet proof skin inside my mind, my brain's holdin' a tec
Y'all rappers are dead now
Get ready cuz y'all rappers are dead now
Get ready cuz I am comin' now
Get ready cuz publicist is dead now
My rap's proof of gangstas and bosses smokin' cigars
Fine eloquent ladies walkin' around wit no bras
It's a magazine full of stained glass kings
I'm the last hope for mankind like what the Nazareth seen
Magnificent, beef? I'll blast from the genes
No agent or booth, I stay in the youth rappin' 16's
The Psychic World of Walter Reed is royalty
Respect the loyalty, biter is an act of forgery
I deal wit them corrigibly
Accordingly I wrap the mic cord around their knees
Then I snatch back till they look like midgets
Something indigenous, I spit fuckin' ridiculous
All of them think your style is fuckin' nuts
Well welcome to syphilis
I usually grab a bitch by her weave
Like bitch I told you to leave
She's like ""Nah Priest, please!""
One destiny, one dynasty, one king
Drivin', starrin' at the horizon
Glarin', compare me to Orion
More like Osiris, two sided, like the Gemini
But it's Priest the Lion
The Leo, Cleo, psychic, I get deep wit this rhymin'
Writin', so many people tried to deny 'em
But he keeps climbin'
Yo, my man hung his phrase up in the air
It said ""PWOWR"" caught his words let it sit in my ear
For days, many hours
While in the shower, the heat fog up the mirror
Water drip to a letters, it couldn't be clearer
It spelled: P.W.O.W.R
I saw my face in black space around couple of stars
Come drink the wine of my realness
From the cup of the Gods
Or eat the grapes of my wrath, blood from my bars
My man lit up the haze
The gray smoke showed us the end of days
Hip-Hop's in a dead state, I bet it come out of them graves
The Psychic World of me, it's not a PG
It's the autobiography of the unknown hottest emcee
Neva get noticed, that's why the double is approachin'
Y'all in trouble, the due date's closin'
Give back my style, let go of my flow
Come out of my king's robe, leave my kingdom
There's a difference between me and them and me and him
It's Priest amongst the immortal men
Prepare nigga, 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'
It's difference between me and them
'Psychic World of Walter Reed' nigga comin' soon",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-psychic-priestyle-lyrics
Real Rap Shit,Elizabeth,2009,"The Priest writes like Shakespeare on dope tryptamine*
Acid tablets, unfocus when I wrote this sixteen
The savage graphics, display his madness
Heads full of stars and planets
Eyes and mouths shoot lasers and beams upon the canvas
Rappers beware, the Mantinian
Customize rhyme in his hardrive
Above the dark skies, open up his archives
His bars provide, I hang words up in ya dome
My chair becomes a throne
I snatch ya body out of ya bones
Body of God, so big I can't fit in a Mosque
I can't fit in a Synagogue
My head is the galaxy, my center is Mars
My pen's the Milton Bradley, fun pool
For thugs and goons to play in
Happy 12-gauge and mac-10's, telescopes
With the photography film
I spit that artistry flam
Rap gats snap shots
A biblical rose and prophecy lens

This that real shit
That real shit
Shalom ock
I spit that real shit
This that real shit
That real rap, that real shit

It's like Demerol, write rhymes my skin will crawl
Light's dim, sweat roll from my chin will fall
A sweat pool of jewels
Work the pencil like a tool
Black faces, white cloth
Brothers from the Synagogue
Pause, Jesus on Ecstasy pills
A hydro-prophecy electro endorphins released thrills
Spill cringe up his grill
Spread love or shed blood
Lead buss, red flood
Twelve thousand characters in my mind barium
My mental have flesh
Words are the swords from the stone poem
A T-Rex caliber, Doctor Mindbender
My nurse squirts the syringes as she entered
The surgeon emerging, latex glove
When do I begin? Rhymes elevate the child world
Curious kid, mind of Priest
Mysterious rhymes increase
Pyramids designed in the East
Lines get deep, ever learning playhouse with the gauge out
Stars implode and explode
Take ya hoody off ya forehead with doubts


Ya style is machine washed and dried
Extra cycles for you wack writing dudes
Fabric softer and dyed
Cut off his thigh, hang 'em outside
All y'all niggas is wack now
No cheerleading in the background
Backhand smack you clowns
Who wanna get down?
See I'm King like the Emperor of Beijing
Who put his words up in the solar-screen
I'm what the lion told his cub those were dreams
Orion rhyming Osiris papyrus
Pilot brush soon as the King eyes shut
The volcano Priest erupts
Woool hook up the beat
Now I'm making some more, after hip-hop death
The resurrection, the future blows out his breath
I spit, split morgues into two
Skeleton rapping in veteran's jacket
With medals and badges
Bad medicine, reaction, the pills don't work
From the hills I lurk
From the fields they search
Life after life, feel these verse


Man, fuck y'all, Sir Lancelot plots is flop
I'm Arthurian with Glocks, my bars are barium
The Barbarian, move, watch this smooth alien in clots
Shock you swim in aquarium with shark
Watch the thick glass, bitch ass!
Reach for the mic and get ya wrist slashed
Psychic doctrine, spit with Solomon oxygen
Purple seasoned with olive skin
The virtual of Jesus is what I follows in
Stand like Giza, invade like Ottomans
Aura from the Torah
Horror from Walter make me the Killah Priest with ya head to offer
Light the Menorahs, sprinkle the waters
Séance from the graveyard
The grey shark crayons, clay chalk
Days are dark, write a flow that'll enlighten the globe
It's raining; you seem to hate fire bowls
And one flaming soul, it's Priest
The mystique of a Beast with the mic when he writes
He's the light; he can burn any emcee you know


Man, can't deal with the God, u'no'I'mean?
Line for line, yeah, it's that real shit
Yeah, it's what y'all wanna see right?

Wanna know how I got here?
How it all came to be?
My beginning?, yo

A dark December eve my mother conceive a species
Some sorta rare breed believed to be of God's seed
With royal blood flowing through her genes
Answer would come to her in her dreams
The child you bare is a king
He's the heir
Magnificent chair
Also shall wear the rings
Till I give him a pair of wings
In January she fought off bats
The FBI firing gats even lion attacks
Running from wolf packs through the woods black
Never looked back
A serpent bit her on the leg
But she took that
From February till June four months of gloom
2 more months before their doom
They try to consume a child inside my mothers womb
She withstand the hurricanes and twisters reading scriptures
Earthquakes till my birth date I was given
Even slay the first born children
It was bone chillin'
July 30th came
But that wasn't me that was my nephew
God bless you
He took the first cause you was special
Then it was August
She felt something enormous in her organs

My beginning and the ending while the world is spinning
Menage's with strange women the devil grinning
But I gottta keep my head above water
Molded without the martyr black august and I'm the author

They knew the time and the date of my arrival
Doctors and preachers opening bibles
Philosophers stood wondering
The sky thundering
Inhaling old widows wailing
Windows open
Wind blowing curtains across my head forming a turban
Do not disturb him a stranger said
Standing at the side of my bed placed a crown upon my head
My eyes were black pearls staring at the map of the world
Born to conquer the angel then handed me my armor
Killed in my honor revealed to me where I should wander
Until time for take over
Y'all reigns been great but now its over
Now I lounge in castles surrounded by great statues
A pool of jewels old kings swimming thru women and rings
A joyous time so sing


I was born 40 nights its stormed hell spawned
I latched onto my mothers arms
Writing my name my pen became somewhat of a chain
A beard grew intuition given me a clear view
My hair turning white
Perm like Snoop Dogg's (biatch!)
I seen black boots in the fog
Skeletons and army fatigues
Dead friends warn me thru dreams like Ebenezer Scrooge
I shall lead the schools show them secrets of the ancient masters

Greatest Lesson,Black August: Revisited,UnKnown,"Our reason for fighting is this..
We were only meant to fight in one war only
That battle between the sons of light..
And the sons of darkness, ordained by God
That is our service
Now we see that this is that battle and we will fight..
Under your command

Priesthood..

I stepped in a church ashamed, naked and hurt
Wet from the rain, my face shows pain
I'm desperate in search for answers
Grabbed the pamphlet that the ushers handed
Blood stain shown through my shirt
Cause beneath, my arm was bandaged
I walked up the aisle but didn't stop 'til I got the altar
I was being blocked by the preacher's supporters
But he'd seen my torture
So-called friends filled me with false love
I spoke ""Sorry I have nothing to offer
But lost hope and an empty soul""
See the Devil tempts me like Jobe, everything I had I now owe
He took my girl, shook my world, lost my crib
It was all his except for my kids
That's what I thought 'til I'm at court with my wiz
She doubled-crossed me then slid
She forced me to live in solitude now the bottle's my food
I follow no rules but if the gospel is true

But he stopped me cold and called me a fool
He said I was rude the way I'd intrude
Then I tossed him this jewel..

You judge me but what would you do if you was me?
If you saw through my eyes
If you've felt the pain that I've felt inside
What would you do? Would you cry?
Ah, thought so, I do sometimes..
See you have a home and a swimming pool, the big backyard (yeah?)
Large living room, fed with a silver spoon
You probably sinning too but don't know
Pardon me if I'm offending you but I won't go
I question my faith, been in a depressional state (yeah man)
Self-hate, one day blessings will wait
Stared death in his face, planning my 'scape
I've seen D's stretching out tape
I've 'visioned prison dates, injected with the venom of snakes
Women with grapes, slept with in rooms pyramid-shaped
Walls covered with hieroglyphics, I'm far from religious
It was said in my first introduction
Which was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
For me it went deeper than just reading a verse
Seeing it first, I needed work

Musifixtion,Black August,2003,"{*dogs barking*}
Priesthood
It's time to ride on y'all
A cat named Priest, yo

They say it comes like a thief in the night
Some say you see fire when he breathes on the mic
The legend has it, his neck and his back is tatted
On his arms are scriptures of psalms
Just vision a Don with vultures on his shoulder
A pearl gun in his holster under the seat
One on the chauffer, twisted cobras in front of his ride
Gun to his side, blunted eyes
Lookin' up at thunderous skys
The wonders arrive, statues change position
Stone eyes open up, pupils follow me inside
This is the time, the twisted mind of Priest
White wolves leap out the woods
Bite at the hooves of all the horses
Return like Christ in the hood
And the month now is Black August, c'mon

They all deny me (pain...y'all really wanna get guns)
Stood right beside me (pick one, which one)
Try to divide me (if y'all really wanna go for it)
While y'all all musify me (holla back and let a nigga know)
They all deny me (pain...y'all really wanna get guns)
Stood right beside me (pick one, which one)
Try to divide me (if y'all really wanna go for it)
While all y'all musify me (holla back and let a nigga know)

Picture me on a black cross
Black crows near both arms
Blood drippin' from both palms
And I'm squirmin' cuz the sore of my wounds are burnin'
Tossed from the wombs of virgins
I seen it all, medical room of surgeons
Read it all in the KP version
I look down, people spittin' and cursin'
Everybody quiet, listen to the sermon
Record execs dress like Romans
Pierce in my side, I'm goin through convulsions
Starin' straight to a jet black ocean
Three times I heard the rooster crow
Cats I used to know denied me but now use my flow
Used to feel my taste, my eyes searched the crowd for a familiar face
All bein' persecuted for purchasing the music
I'm like the works of a Judas
Or does it when I hurt my movement
While crooked lawyers gamble at the foot of my cross
My spirit leaves to the hoods of New York
I see streaks of lightning, angels with white wings
Above me flapping across the skies
They thought I died until one of them heard my cries


Now I'm back with blood on my hands, blood on my wings
Clutchin' two sub-machines, duckin' and screams
Two fully loaded magazines with M-16's
Clappin' in the crowd, I empty out and reload
I squeeze low, with one knee to the flo'
I'mma get all you bastards
Loadin' up bullets the size of carrots
The kind the CIA find on the Arabs
When I'm through y'all won't need any caskets
I'mma leave y'all for the birds and the maggots
Then I'mma strike the matches
Burn up ya corpses, it's like I'm possessed by forces
Priest the sorceress, then the clouds gather
Then the foul scatter, in the air I can taste the warfare
Y'all didn't think I'll be back for vengeance
Well y'all wrong, now suffer the consequences
And I came with armed defenses
Highly trained to break your fences in
Chorus

Yeah they wanna musify me man
Just like they crucified Christ
But this is music, they musified me
But just like him, if I die
I rise in three days
Believe me don't search at the grave
I'll be in the PJ's hahahaha

I Am,Behind the Stained Glass,2008.0,"I was born like that, I live like that
Feel me? Free, so let it be
I Am... King, transform the God
Of who? Of me

If I could write my own obituary
I tell of things I've seen and heard, I'll admit not a bit was scary
'Cause it was real so I'll feel no remorse
For those who try to crucify me then kneel to my cross
Why do women love to come in my life then leave?
Then hate the way I talk, he tries to walk righteously
They listen to their friends, my sins, my short comings
Impregnated your thoughts with their nonsense
When all of them have lost husbands
Wives have trials, try to save lives
Life and death is in the hands of what you feed the family
Think of poisoning the God? Then plea to insanity
Nah, Satan you a liar, internal fire
The life eternal of things that concerns the writer
The brighter inferno of ring that make the sky light up
We're bound by honor, we're bound law
What I found is armor, his word is the sword
Heard by all but felt by few
Before I make a cause, my inner self I view
If Corinthians is correct, gave you the respect
Not the jealousy of the next couple trouble of steps
Let's cuddle to death

I was born like that, I live like that
Feel me? Free, so let it be
I Am... King, transform the God
Of who? Of me

My manifestation came when you were hand to hand with Satan in reign
My crown rolled upon the ground, I'm slained, drizzling rain
Wait, my adrenaline done came
I'm still in the game, I rose like Neo
Behold, meet me in the sequel
For the people, the soaring eagle, fall like D-evil
Divinity sentence me, infinity, imagery seeing scenes when I dream
My genes is like that of a King but that energy leaves
Like a spiral of Bibles, going up it's Jacob's Ladder
God break up my matter
Spiritual body is formed, so long, stop trying to hold on
Appear in white and gone like a snowstorm
Belove it, be not ignorant of this one thing
A day with the Lord is a thousand years
Yards of blood, miles in tears, clouds turn clear
I'm finally there
My mind's prepared to climb those stairs to my destiny
My kindred body set it free; the spirit alone let it be
I got my weaponry; secondly my seventh plane is heavenly
The unexplained is shown of me, the mysteries, the thrones
I'm giving keys to the bottomless pit
Solomon whits, the obvious man will marvel at this

I was born like that, I live like that
Feel me? Free, so let it be
I Am... King, transform the God
Of who? Of me",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-i-am-lyrics
To Be King,Elizabeth,2009.0,"Alien abduction, crack pipe seduction
His weed lip proceed to see shit for telling what's coming
Malachi York talk, see Pale horses running
Gray clouds gather over slave, child and master
Dickies cap turn to a crown, royal pen fell
Laid down this chapters
Red carpet hurling from God hands
Out of heaven's projects, 900 worlds before me
It's no object (Nope)
My six inner eyes foresee so cosmic
My heart beats outside of my chest
To be king these fools, to be lied on my death
God energy hides in my breath
I spit seeds, divinity colliding with flesh
I speak jewels after diamonds are pressed
Inside my skulls are all the bodies of Orion compressed
Now come bless
 (x2)
To be king - The child, his death, his glory
To be king - The word of mouth, the texts, the story

My bars artery bleeds photography
See the artistry in galleries of galaxies and odyssey
Unroll the scrolls of dark prophecies
On top of black gothic pew
Reporting crimes that shift the globe
Priest, the fallen rise, his Book of Job
They said toxins finally took his toll
But look behold, I take you on a Brooklyn stroll
A street kid to a king in robes
Since a shorty throwing dreams, I hold
I'm having strange diagnoses when I'm writing hopeless
I focus, rhymes are drug, potions potent
I fill my blood with a dosage
I see cop cars clapping at convicts, in hot pursuits
Niggas shooting burners and hiring prostitutes
High heels, dark corners, Timb boots
Dealer with lots of loot, demon in amour suits
Houses, barnyards filled with militia groups
I also see a thousand palaces in the sky
My third-eye unchain a phoenix bird, fly
I see hundred of prophets in my conscious
Reaching for my palm through a fence
Then read the psalms, you a prince
 (x2)

My rap's a bad poof for baptizing gangsters that's old school
Niggers and killers, rocking gold jewels
Visual Pro Tools,  tryptamine, sixteen
Xanax, hands a sketch, orbit trip
Hieroglyphs across your eye lid screens
Livest kings, rise of the machines
The manatee, gold body
Volts run through us, Pope's Godly
His heart beats like God walk through the streets
The three Killer P trilogy
Stone heart of Mozart, flow's dark
Blows wizardry, gold frames
Flow on the stained glasses, break it into fragments
On this canvas from the carving of the dragon
Blasting the futuristic model Magnum
The hollow's atom, the Red Sea under red sky
The Blood King, Young Jedi
The fire and the blood rise
Shoot outs his eyes and his mouth
Devour all, power fall from the outer laws of the universe
I shoot a verse, bring down his walls
Spread the flower for his morgue",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-to-be-king-lyrics
Killah Man,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"Afternoon cartoons - Gatsu come
Part chew gum, hard screwed slums
Killah's are familiar, the cost-stealers
Shark niggas in dark oceans of omens
Cold wind's blowin' - 'Fuck the World' is the slogan
ShoGuns give a fuck for no one
Even hot weather, shot and pop together
Gangster teardrops, life endeavors
Mexican Cartel of shock tales
Spark L's of smoke spells
La Familia, we drink hard liquor
Takin' shots at the killah
Weed grows out of Solomon's grave
I place hollows in gauge
The night swallows the day
Police ride around wit the old Chiefs
Circlin' the block, no curfew
Crime don't stop, nine's go pop
We close shop

Incitin', writin' wit the mic enlighten them
No hype in sight, enticin' them
Take a vicodin like a Viking helmet wit two long horns
Try to hold me but I'm hot and too damn strong
Meltin' them, King Kong held the gun
Take the planets, play ping-pong against my shadow
Throw God's armor on, who wanna battle?
Clash of the swords
Talk like a Lord then die like a Lord
Live today, die foreva, pots rye from pressure
Hot spray eyes wit peppers
Acetic niggas neva learn
This is alkaline rhyme wit calcium line
Neutralize mineral high, newest calories
Shoot from balconies, read the world is mine
Tuxedos, duck from eagle, buss at you and your peoples
Cuss when I discuss how I'm gon' to defeat you

Temple of the Mental,Intonarumori,UnKnown,"Time... come...
Wake up... what?... wake up..
I can't get up yet
What we have here is the experiment
(My eyes, I can't see)
It's called the 6 million dollar man
(I can't see) He has the speed of a cheetah
The site (I can't see) of a falcon (my arms)
Strength (what's happenin to me) of a hundred guerillas
(What's gonna happen?) Welcome to the new world
We gonna give you a name (What is you talkin about?)
What should we call him? Let's come together in one mind
What should we call him? We should call him The Electric Man
Right, we gon give you a time, to break out
Time of life, and then the hunt goes on
Ready? Let's start the clock
Electric... Get outta here, I'mma break out, I'mma break out

Outta one came many, Electric Man runnin through the Electric City
Ruled and govern by electricity, it's like a dream
Our superiors are pathetic and they show synthetic pity
Road blocks are set up by robots, cops to check your code wit a red dot
You can hear man plead for his self esteem
For the love of God, we all sufferin
We fall asleep, they handcuff us in our dreams
We wake up and scream, the world explodes if it's overload, we hug our pillows
Heads inbreeded wit barcodes, it begins to burn, slow like charcoal
Millions of civilians ride by the carloads
They head to the ships of the cargos, they head back to the Congo's
After the bomb goes, ban 'fro's, Beetle brand clothes
You wake up in your dreams yellin, silent screams
Every time you breath is recorded by scientist teams
DNA, mind is demonic survey's when you speak, they confuse you wit wordplay
Claimin Christ never rose on the third day
That was a Good Friday, and the day he fell was on a Thursday
The undisciplined, the ignorant, the insufficient
And the unworthy, screamin for God's mercy
R.L.S. get bloodthirsty, many were persecuted
Executed, that have no soluted
Family trees were uprooted, anyone found on the streets were obsolete
Military killed the unnecessary, cops would cheat
Death, grenades, blades, anti matter rays
Through age, hurricane tidal waves of slaves
Follow the maze through the grave
Those who disobey, now obey
Somethin satanic invades the planet
Panic, the Sun of Man versus the Uncle Sam
Line intruder meets the computer, alert ya sharp shooters
Send the weapons that where nuclear up to Jupiter
New stars, Lucifer, global drag that space this
And the racist of the great wisdom of Malcolm X
I'm stressed on house arrest
New World Order, the slaughter as Solomon and Godorrah
Beast rises from the bottom of the water
Havin seven heads wit plagues
The feds versus the dreads, the reunion of the Soviet Union is ruined
Watchin every day like the movie True Men
Thugs push off their last minute drugs
Marines jump in their submarines and get their machine guns
No more sunlight, the final fight
Bring forth your pitchforks and your pipes
And you shovels, the rebels and the Devils are now leveled
Bacteria becomes superior, man becomes inferior
And the day of the prophets, so did the little child
Lookin through the windows of Spartan
The sky fill wit total darkness, the world of total stillness
Energy arisin from a local village, no more privilege
Men hearts'll feel this, vocals are silent quiet, do you feel it?
Peace and quiet, no more riots, soft like whispers
We see men wit gold slippers, read the scrolls of scriptures
Garments were angelic, gold robes that were sowed wit velvet
Silver helmets, children were silk, drinkin soy milk
Laughin and lookin at the world that they built
Calm lake, smooth evergreens, new redeem
Food for the kings and the queens
They all seen shakin the tambourine, shakin all the cymbal
They dwell in the Temple of the Mental
No more poverty stricken, robbery, guns be clickin
Forever burnin in this furnaces of affliction
Over dose and drug addiction
Thugs who just buy the system, will shut the blood of the victim
Sacrilegious, savages trapped in prisons
Trynna adapt the wisdom, they sit back and listen
To the old timers, the beast out the clotheslines
Bullets claim the lives of minors, shoot-outs in front of local spots
Even TV's takin photo shots, we in the third world
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
Terrestrial escape through the east gate
Electric types of prones, protons, neutrons
Electric soul, electric glow, electric probes
Electric lights light up the night
Neon, skies, neon site
Note the flight, first man, mind and sometimes
Resemble Einstein's now turn into Frankenstein's
What's yours is mine, I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail
I'll give my life before my word fail",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-temple-of-the-mental-lyrics
Time,Black August,2003,"I know how tough it is *gunshot*

My life flashes, I'm eight years old, my face stares cold
At the pastor, as he picks up the robe
He reads a chapter, his voice is like, grabbin' my soul
The seeds turn blacker and finally it fades out slow
The hearing after, a whole brand new screen show
I hear laughter, it's my birthday, I'm eighteen years old
I'm on gates between Monroe, eight fiends and young hoes
The flake dreams with gun blows, wake screams and blunt rose
Up, they lit it, some hit it, I'm drunk
So much, that I can't see straight
Another flash, I'm in a fancy place
A waiter walks over, hands me a plate
I trance it to escape, but it's too late
I shoot my casket, my moms screamin' bastard
Ya'll know who killed them, filled them with them lugers
Ruger, you God damn hoodlums
But it's too late, I see the king in the New Jerusalem
I can touch the gates

Time keep on ticking
Stay focused, ain't no time for politicking
Got to keep our young brothers out of prison
Every day, I dream it feels like a nation, listen

Was this my fate, to be judged in this place
Angels watchin' me, I step up to plead my case
I see his face in black space, okay let me back space
Somethin' went front between that gat and my waste
Somethin' went wrong between the slow reaction when they were clappin' my way
Is this the judgment, the place where every thug has been
After hearin' gun fire, and slugs go in
Are you the chosen, or the one known as the omen
The gates are open, I wanna know where I'm going
Is this the place I was destined to come, I slept in the slums
Next to a bum, saw death pestilence and guns
I was born cold naked and young
Mouth open, rings slashin' off of cardboard, wettin' my tongue
We prayed for the shepherd to come
I was called a monster, I was a youngster
Crawlin' out the dumpster, toes were bloody, clothes we muddy
Eyes were crummy, peeped to the skies above me
Cried I'm ugly, found out this life don't love me
Despised by the country, paralyzed in my one knee
Talked to the most high, Priest, hug me, real, real


No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Priesthood, Savoy Murda
G-13, what's poppin', oh, no, no, no
No, it's real, it's real
It's real, just sing it when it's real
It's real, it's real, it's real, it's real",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-time-lyrics
Vendetta Kingz,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I laugh at you peasants, the death birds keep peckin'
I'm destined for blesses
My lessons adolescence till I'm out of the presence
Her outta the essence, the hour of seven
The tower of heaven, the power of legend
I place flowers on dead men's, you cowards beheaded
Dark clouds hover the Reverend
My rap industry, ministry, her menstrual bleed
Every couple of years, here's a cup full of cheers
While she's cut from her ears; to where the other is pierced
Die bitch, we back ridin' the Cherubim
Back leapin' from wing-to-wing mockin' you
Jack honorable Kings, infallible
Vendetta, Berettas with treasures in Queens
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime
Together we sing forever regime
Came to reign like the Prophets, let it pour from the sky
Look close; see the Empire formin' in my eyes
It's like a thousand stars shinin' for a moment in time
Had to fight thru all the haters layin' dormant in the sky
So I started from a Trojan, cut the cord and I cried
""Please Lord"" I live for glory, evil forces to the side
King David in my splendor, I was gorgeous in my prime
Had armies ridin' horses look like Porsches when they glide
No borders on my fortress, here's the portion of the pie
I traded fortunes for a name and stabbed the order in it's eye
The warrior stood tall like a sword was in spine
Brought 'The Offering' with Priest, said the source was in ya mind
Make sure the angels sing the chorus, holdin' torches for the tribe
Tell the story for the shorties and record it till you die
The planet ran to Mars, rest of y'all granted the hand of God
I can't stand it, crack the granite when I'm managin' bars
The paper scratched out, lookin' like a bandage and scars
But I survived far enough to see the guns in green
Pearly essence like the ocean, it's so marvel to see
I'm audible like the presence of the Lord when I speak
The world is an audience designed for my glory to breathe
Recordin' my deeds enormous like a feast when I feed
Mental fruit to the people not what the snake gave Eve
We need to kill off the evil with the force of gang green
So I can transcend to heaven as a spirit and gleam
Throughout galaxies, stretch like an infinite stream
The power is limitless, Priesthood combined with the Kingz
I take a verse from Saint to hallelujah without a hollow point
I still move right straight thru ya
Lines like a wop-bama-booma
Smack ya head thru the Mardi gras
Mighty far, the Calhoun fall
Eat my way thru this track for a mars bar
Back to the Chicago line
Ain't no train gon' off this track
Pilot ready to crash, I'm off the Richter scale
They gettin' ready to bring a better deal
My raps is whateva, foreva kill
Heaven's the mega skill
Type my hype shit, wear a crown like Evansville
I keep it straight then a better business bureau
Serial killer with more bandana then thrilla in Manila
With split seconds away from being simple
Burnin' thru rituals, make a cloudy days become visual
Don't get it f*cked up, whether it be sunshine from digital
Gut splittin' on spiritual, lunar draws original
With heat seakin' material, 60 Sec the miracle
Mind fury icicle, cold pop ya top like a Michelob
Don't make my circuit or triple load
Open ya mind up like vapor, I'm the Vicks in ya nose
Open you up till I become a hole in ya soul",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-vendetta-kingz-lyrics

Though I'm not with you now, let's connect in our spirit
Cut out the lights, talk to my ghost in the dark
Let's share our pain, my niggas bring me close to your heart
So the devil thought he broke us apart, nah, we lick through the stars
Through the ink that I write in each bar
Show the soul as we share our most inner thoughts
Cuz I heard God listened once sin is taught
Beginners walk through my hood and I show you my struggle
Then we walk through your hood and you show me your hustle
Plus those marks on your wrists, it's where the cops had cuffed you
Hard luck too? Well me too, screaming peoples
Let's make a peace truce, unify all of the gangs
No quarrels between us, you and I is the same
As we build on a higher plain
Like pyramids too mysterious for the human mind to explain
Come on!

All praise is due to man, woman and child
To the monuments that stand at the top of the Nile
Let everything that have breath in it, give praise
To all my homies in the struggle, get paid

When will they profit? The game is where I lose my soul
How many options did I have before I choose this roll?
Let's see, what did spark it? Fuck school and hoes
Live in the projects, never rocked the newest clothes
It's psychologic, somehow it seems foolish though
From my pockets, only love for jewels and dough
Catastrophic, the walls came closing in
On all sides, the pressure expose the gem
A war cry was the breath I was holding in
A poor scribe dopest as the golden pen
Called wise, blessed among the chosen men
The lost tribe, my words were woven in
Each line like words I was sewing with
I sit divine, my palm hold the globe with a grip
Flows I spit, shows I rip, that's showmanship
Tell the maid from the robes I fit
A blackness covered the moon from a lunar eclipse
A passage leads to a tomb beneath the sands of Egypt
Candles are lit, and the keys to the pianos are hit
There's the phantom, the mummy stands at the cliff
Aztec Indians studying my Sanscrit
Puffing peace pipes, Priest gets deep when he writes
Bars are mystic, written like Horror-glyphics
I made it hard for critics to follow my lyrics
Come on!
Chorus x2

Uh huh, Feel it, where's the troubles at?

Rogue Godz,Planet of the Gods,2015,"VERSE I
Pilot dragons sailing through the eyes of monsters
Conquer island of the scientist
Iron ship flying disk
Landed on the shores of the moors
Men of war swinging swords
Battle axe pharaoh hats
Shadows trap the light of the day
As we pray
Approaches the end
The vultures ascend
The coldest of winds
Blows over men
Poet transcends
The holder of pens
Soldiers begin to shoot
At the birth of Zeus
From God's roof
Then disappear like poof
Gog and Magog
Rogue gods
Torpedo cigars
The baldheaded villain
Rubbing the emerald skull
His words were chilling
From the land of Null
Tell the account
Send the amount
For the count
On Mount Yugoslavia
Removed the bodies of Dr Smith and his sexy sidekick
The bitch was high risk
Right then bullets flew through the iris of his Isis
He grab the nurse that gave him his dialysis
They both fall into his gold obelisk
Beneath an iced out sign that read
""Annuit coeptis novus ordo seclorum""
Bleeding, one bullet caught him right between his ???
His native tongue he began talking
Zat Yat art grabbed his heart
His eyes rolled back, he said ------ lie
Close his eyes, then he died
His demise
Tomb raiders
Ziggurat builders
VERSE II
Space pirates, skeleton kings
Snake empire seraphim wings
Star Osiris reptilian queens
Eggs of vipers build the machine
Ghost ships on the rivers of blood
Float silent through the cliff killers above
The evidence fits between the murder and glove
Prosecute justice and handcuff love
By then the dragon will win
The world's beauty pageant
And take home awards to every movie imaginable
Also the winner of fashion
Become the biggest star
Right before declares himself a god
Speak in an unholy accent
And grab access to everything that's blasphemous
Wear the head of a Baphomet
With the 7 on his chest like Kapernick
But his team will block out the sun
As he leaves the people as savages for the Nazareth",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-rogue-godz-lyrics

(So what we live by?)
The laws of the most high
(Moses?) Yes!
He received that on Mount Sinai
(For the Israelites right?)
Indeed, 'cause man once believed in other Gods
They received the sun, moon and stars
(From the Egyptians?)
Yeah they were enslaved over there
For over 400 years of hard labor and tears
What a coincidence (Almost the same time?)
Yep! Black people had spent over here
Which brings me to this important fact
The ancient Israelites were black!
(If we keep his laws and study his commandments
We can chase the devil right off of our planet
If we don't lie, hate or kill one another
Boys obey your fathers, girls obey your mother)
And this is law
Sing along children
Sing along

Who killed Abel over jealousy
And this been going on for centuries

Your Condoleezza's, your Oprah Winfrey's
(And who is that?)
Michael Jordan, your Muhammad Ali's
(Tell us more about Esau)
And Jacob, sure
Want to hear more? (Yeah!)
Well they were twins in Rebekah's womb
And they were fighting
(Fighting for what?) For more room
I guess, so she suggest, she should ask the Lord
So she prayed, while her husband Jacob snored
And she was told: ""These two kids should be two nations
From the womb they shall be separated
The one shall be stronger then the other
(But they were brothers)
And one loved by the father
The other by the mother""
And look deep in the story you will discover
(The mysteries)
The first kid was hairy and red; he was a hunter
Sold his birth right because of hunger
The second child was a cool peaceful brother
His skin resemble his father and mother
Nutting more to explain
Let's say later on in the chapters their names changed
And nothing ever stays the same

Discography of all of my music
Pro-God, call it a movement
On the stage with the RZA to the Gravediggaz
GZA use to say I was his favorite spitter
Lyrics on how I made pictures
Though I never really wanted it
Till they put mad challenges in front of the kid
I was a fan of the Wu-Tang Clan
A bigger fan of Method Man
Stayed loyal, respect the fam
R.I.P. to Grym Reaper (That's my man)
And my pen gets deeper
Diary of a Madman, went like this
RZA use to brag about my rhymes
On that song I had a chance to shine
But I ain't want it
RZA told me that a storm was coming
Even a Messiah blow the trumpets
But when I got there, I wasn't prepared
So I said what I already had
Which left all attention on Bazz
Which felt that the tension was bad
But that wasn't the vision I had
We both came in as solo artist
I didn't care who flowed the hardest
My mind was on my nephew Marcus
Tryna rescue him from the projects
But that didn't happen
He got shot, D got knocked
He sees my block, I see this cop
Said he was dead on arrival
Cried, tryna read my Bible
I had sick thoughts and revenge on my mind too
I wasn't thinking of vinyl
I was thinking like final
But time moves, it past
Bazz gave me his hand, help me to stand
Back then we didn't understand
God plan is far too advance
Man, I knew I had something that would prove just the theory
Once the world hear me
Liquid Swords, I get on board
To record Basic Instruction, great introduction
Since the plague for destruction
For the fake emcees with the weak production
When I adjust the pen it get sucked in
I break emcees, I shake emcees
We shake emcees till they sound like me
But there's only one, sincerely son
Compare me to none
Maybe Rakim or Kane or Kool G Rap
Priest write movies and cracks

Nah'mean, that's how that go right there
Y'all know the history of Priest
Priesthood, aka the Sun of Man
It's what we do, no'm'sain
Bazz you my man, you know how we did
Back then, Diary of a Madman
To everybody out there, nah'mean
That's just a lil brief, walk through
All my reign and my tears, you'know
This goes out to my nephew Marcus, ascended

So what you want, huh?
So what they want, huh?

The bullet or the bribe, cartels bomb shells
Cocktails with wine, poison choices under the sky
Fireworks, dye in the dirt, crime experts
Nine in his shirt, street line the work
God design, stars burst
My mind twine with the universe
Thru this verse get reclined
Bone analysts await the baggages
Quicker Judges who await the packages
Gats to rib, all under cameras
Here come the savages
Master this, in one place 'till I finish the line

Organized crime are murdering cops
Shark attorney eat kids swerving on blocks
Burial plots, machine gun shots
Supreme got knocked
Or the psychic of the righteous
What draws me to write this?
Is it the universe hands or what the planets demand?
Or is the essence that brings a hundred Gods on my presence to stand?
What makes me write this record?
What makes him give this message? (I don't know)
Is it just us or justice when this mic blow amps

Two trillion demons that I trapped in my ring
Flow thru my chips like people walking thru Beijing
Praise the king, Polonius dream
Body building with lyrics
Rap increase till I'm labeled supreme
I gave y'all eternal life
Day turns to night
From the grave I returned to the mic
To the page I turn on to write

Smell the heat as I send you to hell beneath

The Last Supper,Black August: Revisited,UnKnown,"Our Father going through Heaven I'll be thy ming
They Kingdom Come and will be done
And Earth does it in (.. ? ..)

The last supper, Christ around the master brothers
Same story but this time they have color
Stars and moon hover, everybody wrapped in covers
In the upper, the lamb's tell him what he has to suffer
Last cup of wine poured, a knock at the door
Simon Peter had his hand locked on the sword
Every eye watched the Lord to see what he do
But he was peaceful, before he knew
The time was at hand, they should kill the Son of Man
So the man sat down, all the disciples around him
Him and his center, then entered the twelth member
And Christ reached down, took a loaf of bread
Divided it amongst twelve heads
Then he spoke and this is what he said
""This is my body for rememberance, I'm dead
Likewise, after we sup', in this cup is my blood
Which shall be shed for you for the love""
He said his grace then ""Let's grub""
Everyone dug in their plate by Christ's face didn't budge
I guess he was searching who the snake was
Then he said ""Also one of you shall betray me""
Take Matthew, looked at him like he was crazy
He felt scared then they all worried
Asked him, ""Who could it be?""
Then he said, ""The one who dipped his hand in the dish with me
At the same time I do mine that shall be the sign""
His head in a forward direction, he reached down
Across the table, Judas reaches like his own shadow reflection
I guess every could stop guessing
So Judas looked around the table like ""What the fuck?""
He got up and walked out
Everyone shocked, covered their mouth
(Oh shit that's Judas son? I can't believe it!)

In the day that we live
We live, never consider those that were here before us
Did the same deeds so they wrote to warn us
Though as it was written, let it be told
Check for the clues as the story unfolds

So the Messiah chased him to Mount Olive
Told every man to stay awake, at least to daybreak
Beware of traitors and snakes, keep the faith
Scribes and Pharisees are after me, then the chapter reads
Upon the hill where he kept it real, he knealed
Told the Lord, if it's his will, let it done
The death of his son, will have his reward when the ressurection comes
Then he rode from his prayer, glored of his hair, walked down from the lair
Saw his disciples lying there, screamed on them
With that he walked back to his PJ's
Then he begins to talk about how he's betrayed
Die and rise in three days and Peter so afraid
That he spoke out in rage, stop the land from speaking
He said, ""Whoever put his hand on my Lord, we'll kill 'em all
This is the acts of a real Christian"", but Christ just listened
Leaned back recalled a vision, told him coldly
""In the final hour, before the rooster crows three times
You will deny that you every known me""
At the same time Judas comes back with a money sack
Attached to his jock strap, gave him a kiss on the jaw
Christ asked, ""What was that for?""
Soldiers kicked in the back door
Like cops, Peter whipped out the ox

Damn.. to be continued
Then.. a View From Masada
You'll know the stories unfold every time

Shots were fired, screeching tires, cars peal off
Screaming kid knealing by the sidewalk
Cops swarming at night dressed like cyborgs
Villains escaped from a time off
In 2000, crime in New York

We all go blood, we all gon' go
Look at these thugs man, we all gon' go
We all got a plate to eat

Fall of Solomon,Best of Killah Priest & A Prelude to the Offering,2008,"What up, Priest?
What up, cat?
Since you're one of the dopest MC's that I ever heard
I want you to kick the story
Yeah, I got one, already..
The dopest story I heard, check it

Thieves in the temple, a priest murdered at the doorstep
He heard the hounds of horses, surround his fortress
Look down, the whole town with torches
Blood on the door knock where our lord slept
Night before the see-er saw it, so they slept nautious
Broken windows with cannisters, hidden cameras
Masked man at the top of the bannister
Shattered glass everywhere, someone pushed his man down the stairs
A knife in the back with a note attached, read 'Beware'
Looked up, saw a blowin curtain, a open window
And heard the whistle of the soft air, someone screamin 'warfare'
So Solomon takes cover, a servant yells out 'the bitch is cursed
Don't touch her', but he trusts her, he also loves her
Calls her the Rose of Sharon, his bright morning star
HisLily of the Valley, a spy cut her throat inside a dark alley
Someone knocked his daughter off a balcony, bloodshed in Galilea
The cowardly flee to the hills of Cabarea
Thieves of a hundred gates, the queen of cities
No one shows pity, flyin spirits, floatin demons, fallen saints
Soldiers walkin by their ranks, service of the East gate, scared to drink
What would our leaders think? Every man lookin at each other, scared to blink
The seed inside the sanctuary, scary
Portraits of Saint Mary, with Mona Lisa
The Queen of Cheeba, strokin a cheetah
Other mid-wives sayin 'I don't like the way he treats her'
Pass the reefer, bad cheeba, Solomon judge wisely
Wisdom spoken of highly, hair knotty, ask God 'Why me?'

It's the street life that I write
From beginning to end
Dealin with these lies and deceptions
Like the fall of Solomon
And all my niggas in the State Pen
Who doin five to ten

Order these guards to untie me
He said men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his soul
If he's captured he shall restore it, seven fold
A legend unfold, let it be written in the scroll
Solomon's gold, swallow them whole
He said 'Fuck you!', make me another Pagan God
Usin brass poles, spies layin up in the closet
They open the door, they spray holes through the prophets
Solomon whispers, a man reaches in his zipper
The king killed by his own bishop
Hid beneath the bed but gave himself up when he hicced up
Tears of a child, 'Daddy, get up!'
Fast forward, you see Malcolm X fallin from a pulpit
Sprayed up by bullets, dead over bullshit
Niggas layin on the pavement, holes in their Woolridge
Look what the wolves did, full clips and cartridges
Imposters live, adoptthe kids in front of corner stores
Poppin shit, throwin up gang signs at the same time
Them niggas roll dice and fight canines/K-9's
Should I wake 'em up or let 'em stay blind?
Cause education seem like it's only shit to a thug
You either Crip or you Blood, really? I'm sick of the grudge
Y'all niggas need to dip it in blood, I should walk by
And take a flick of your mug, show you how vicious you was
Neighborhood overflooded with liqour and drugs
Young queens grow up to be strippers in clubs
Man, damn son!

Rocket To Nebula,Rocket To Nebula,2020.0,"Y’all climb, I’ll take the shuttle up
This rocket’s towards the nebula
On board with the prophets and the messengers
Withdrawn from the conscious of the regulars
I’m just an agoraphobic space cadet that hasn’t had his head checked, that rides around in a space-mobile, saying “Ya haven’t heard my best yet”
And until I find my place of rest, I’m an insomniac with conscious rap
It’s common facts
Ask around, don’t go Google who got the promise back
‘cause only the streets gonna tell you the real about the psychosis of the compulsive locomotive poet
The force explosive and claustrophobic astronaut that used to rock a flat top
Star track from Tibet, Nassau Project magna-bot
Head like a gigantic radio, back more knobs than a military watch
From the martians to Earth, I was a gift, I arrived in a glass box then ran into the jungle like a Sasquatch
When it came to blackness, Africa is my mascot
But really, this album is a reflection of things we take light
How to make it right, like I hope you had a good night rest or have a safe flight
Balloons at the delivery room
Or that feeling you get when someone says I’ll be there soon
In my life, you’re the most important
I love you, or you’re simply gorgeous
Or they just say, “Just stay” or just “Have a nice day”

Intro (Blackball Me),Priesthood,2001,"Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to +Priesthood+
If you purchased this album from a store
Or you got a copy from a friend
You about to witness one of hip hop's greatest secrets
That the record industry tried to hide
Due to lack of promotion and scandalous intentions
Priest was forced to take his album underground
And now he will no longer suffer
Reviewing this album, you gotta ask yourself why
Look at every song, and I'mma let you decide
He is one of the greatest MC's, ever to roam this planet

Father forgive me, it's the 
Henny
 or 
Remi
Or maybe it's the many of fame, this world planted in me
When I was just a child, I was misunderstood
Til I saw your finger in the cloud, I was picked from the hood
I was in the myst of a crowd, when shit wasn't good
Til I heard your voice out loud, then I lifted it good
Doctors wouldn't tell me, the teachers would often fail me
And for a grown child, that shit, just wasn't healthy
When the bitches hadn't dealt me, never planned to help me
But now I'm a man, I understand what's really wealthy
It's not about how much tuition you got in your bank
But it's bout how much ammunition that I got in my tank
Yeah, yeah, now y'all scarred cuz I'm talkin revolution
What ya rather see me dead by a fuckin execution
If y'all probably go to bed, cuz it's less confusion
All your see in yo head, is my electricution
But I'm comin back, and this time I'm strapped
And fuck +The Law+, cuz I'm bustin my gat
And I'm wanted by y'all, and my niggas know that
Cuz once they fire, my niggas shoot back
And straight up on some real shit, I'm a lyrical jewel
Ask a wall in the air, and pay ya spiritual dues
Fuck the B.A.'s, cuz nigga suck a dick
And all ya rabbling backstab, I'm not fuckin wit
Aiyo fuck poppi' collars, I'd rather cock the revolver
And have ya momma cryin, while ya sister's watchin them dollars
I'm one of the best, next to 'Face and Jay, Nas, 'Pac and Poppa
You can say Priest or Masada, fasada, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+

+Blackball Me+, ya just +Blackball Me+
+Blackball Me+, motherfucker, +Blackball Me+

So, fuck those critics, I ain't got no religious
What ya thought, ya act suspicious, but ya get it
So chill wit it, plus nothin of y'all, ever been in my shoes
Ya probably, play wit a doll, when I payin my dues
That's the type of shit that darkens my heart
Where was y'all motherfuckers when Marcus got shot?
Where was y'all when the guns sparked up my block?
Where was y'all when my sister, was coppin those rocks?
Where was y'all when Pooh fell in my arms?
I had to drag him out the buildin, when them niggas was gone
Where was y'all when that nigga, put a gun to my chest?
Pulled the trigger, but no fuckin bullets was left
What ya figure, that my life was filled wit happiness
Ya wrong, I tell you for real and not the fake stories
Ya can get mad and +Blackball Me+, motherfucker

+Blackball Me+ (5X)
+Blackball Me+ niggas, +Blackball Me+
Ya know ya bad motherfuckers, +Blackball Me+, +Blackball Me+
+Blackball Me+, +Blackball Me+
I still come back, motherfucker
It's time, motherfucker
Now you left me to judge, fuckin critics
Monkey judge, fuckin wit a muthafuckin prison
Cuz at the end I'mma see you redemption
Believe that, why tell the truth to Allah...
+Blackball Me+ motherfuckers...

Many people feel haunted
By what they call evidence of evil forces in the world
They see genocide, senseless violence, plagues
And they blame demons, or the Devil himself
They believe that demonic spirits can actually possess a human body
And that only rituals of exorcism
Can lift the possessed from the darkest regions of the unexplained",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-intro-blackball-me-lyrics
Nothing Like It,The Exorcist,2009,"15 wit one in the head, could did it all
No friends were called, then I recalled
Somethin' smeared on the wall
Close relationships I hated it, we split
Dated this chick, atheist
God stained seven but he played the six
Dated CO's, left 'em wit bulge
Kept me in clothes, but said I wasn't respectable
So the sex got cold
Little did I know, I was the next to go
Drivin', starrin' up at the horizon
Flyin', windows down, blastin' the stereo sound
Pass the carnival, the Merry-Go-Round
Goin' up the mountain, to the Indian burial ground
Nothin' but glowin' eyes on the hounds
Sounds of howls, but turnin' the heads of owls
Come thru the white clouds
Look what I found? The psychic
(Hook)
There's nothing like it
There's nothing like it
One of a kind his mind
And there's nothing like it

The last days, signs of the time
I'm on some crime, blind by the television
The hell I vision is rivers of fire
Accordin' to the scriptural writings
There's no after death for the spirit inside us
The afterlife is those chapters we write
All great place a peace, not that lake full of heat
Could you imagine listenin' to a seven headed dragon?
Grabbin', madmen chewin' their heads off
Less talk, while the communist is stabbin'
Now I think those were metaphors and the letters of Paul
Greece and Rome had Olympics, naked gymnasts
For instance, he would say it, if it related
The race is not given to the swift
But, to them that endure, put on the whole armor
We wrestle not against flesh and blood
He was watchin' the Olympic Games thru a prison wall
So the dragon heads were their empires
Led every word of God be true and every men the liar
(Hook)

I turn listeners to my prisoners
Doin' time on my rhymes
Soon as I hit the pen they get to my channels
Stimulatin' the brain cells
Trained to use well, while writin' I ask myself
How long is the sentence?
Not until each line is finished
Usually the bars end a little past the margin
Tho the court in my thoughts
The DA is the clean page; the judge is a ink spot
Right where I think plots
Below the thinkers is the hung jury
It comes to me, truly
What makes me write this? The feelin' inside

Slaughter House Freestyle,The Curse of a Virgin (Bootleg),UnKnown,"My soul will devour all; bring 'em to my thresh to floor
Weapons of war, smashin' head in the wars
They're dead in the morgues, behead 'em wit chainsaws
Black blood in guts, rain within my slaughter halls
Dead flesh cover my apron
From rappers, from bad statements
Wrath of Satan, outta my mouth come flappin' Ravens
Wit the Key to the Bottomless Pit
The great chain in my hand
You rappers stand on quicksand
It's time to quit man
I chop rappers down to bricks into grams
Put 'em in bags, break 'em like crabs
Open 'em like clams
If y'all niggas ain't fam, y'all better stand - clear
This is my redemption, this is your submission
I spit slugs, watch me split 'em, rhymes are radiation
Consume the eyes in their holes
Grab their skulls than crush 'em like coal
Put 'em in my mixin' bowl, full of wicked souls
Let the rhymes cook 'em till the pot whistle
Till the top fizzle, rhymes are not pistols
These rhymes are drop missiles
I leave mammoth murders once my canvas surface
Hands on the mic is like hands on burners
Rhymes are like bullets, carat size
When I let off everythin' to appearance die
I'm stompin' bodies like Hawaiian berries
So deep Anthropologist will have to find you buried
Rhymes are deadly; Behind the Stained Glass
Than I throw you thru that same glass
Till you tear your frame in half
Aim - blast; I offer you for food to pagan Gods
I put graves inside the yards
Scatter your bodies like a deck of cards
I put braids on bars, you're afraid of my bars
React like you've been tasered
It's what I do to a traitor
I'ma Gladiator, I hit the pad like a laser
Hit your dad like a Quasar
I stand still as Mount Rushmore
There's no luck in war, gun buck to the floor
I'm wild as an African insane asylum; the witch nurses
Rhymes will carry you rappers like big hearses
To a big Churches, to big sermons
After I stick verses in your head like pins
Bow, bitch!!! Worship!!!!
Approach me; I'll bring on World War III in 5D
So you can do more than see me closely
Rope around your neck easy, hang you from a Comet
Than clap at you wit nuclear rockets
Before you start the shit you shoulda stopped it
Now you look awkward, floatin' in darkness
(Interlude)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, I ain't playin' no mo' games G
Kno'am'mean? Behind the Stained Glass II gon' be a lil bit harder
Hahahaha, welcome to the Slaughter House
Put on my gloves, its ova! Geah, you know the name
I ain't gotta tell you, whadup Starkim?

Lyrics split you in half, the Wolf versus the Calf
Soon as hooves touch the grass, I'm on top of that ass
Out the woods, no homo, rhymes are pride choke-hold
Till your eye balls swell up, the shell buss
From the sawed off rhyme, the 12-gauge page, the AK lines
Call my dawgs on stage, we okay nines
My note page is a cage wit barb wire lines
My pen is lightning strikin' down my rhyme
I hurl rappers off the Planet Earth like vacuum suck up dirt
They see half-rooms and Stars, now they're deep in the Universe
I pick up rappers like I'm playin' ""Jacks""
My rhymes will touch 'em like ""Duck, Duck, Goose""
""Mother May I"" they let the Devil loose
Rivers of fires, waterfalls of blood to slaughter y'all
Floods of tsunami's probably, an avalanches of rappers
Build dams and I'm still advancin'
Meteor showers, Comet storms, the wrath is approachin' dawn
Dragon sits upon the right arm, I transform big as Megatron
You betta warn, my mind wit the letters will swarm
Too complex for the norm
My lead will start to warm till it's screamin' hot
Than I place the rhyme to ya mind like a heated pot
Cook you from the inside, witness then hear your in cries
You bring a bad vibe; I bring war like somethin' seen in Sci-Fi
Special effects, when it comes to rappin' I'm like the Devil in flesh
The medals on my neck, Othello wit the tek's
Grab the mic like I flex
I'm liftin' weights, wit heavy bars that I press
Who wanna impress, I suggest
Watch me execute them, this is more than music
It's more like Priest shootin'
Niggas talkin' live - I just know how to do them
Chop 'em up, rock 'em up, push 'em to a veggie-nusion
Yo execution!",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-slaughter-house-freestyle-lyrics

Ya'll comin' to this game, like ya'll the nicest
But, anyway, get rich, get brain
Get off the wall and do the damn thing
Get off the floor and do the damn thing
Get off the floor and do the damn thing

Silly rappers, when will you learn
You play with fire and you will get burned
Cuz now, I've been low, lately, waitin' my turn
Turn off my radio cuz I'm not concerned with ya'll
Weak rhymes, same topics
This one's for the streets, for the projects
For my g's with the weed in the apartments
For my dogs in the law hit with charges
Fuck them, cuz I love ya'll regardless
For my chicks in the whips dancin' bra-less
Hair done, nice face, lookin' flawless
I got that thing, bust off, lead objects
Ya'll cats are lame, no threat, it's a promise
Name your favorite rapper, well, he's fake
And you fake, that's why you fuck with his tape
I'll take that thing and just bust in your face
You're not real, same flow, no style
I pop steel, lames, no know who go down
And I don't give a fuck, who run the city or not
Cuz the streets is real, even Biggie got Pac
And I love those niggas, but I don't love ya'll
Bust a slug for those niggas, but bust a slug at ya'll
And I get physical, visual, very artistical
Givin' party people something, funky to listen to
Hizza, hey, my rhymes is blizza, blazed
Cross your fizza, face, down to your waist
Raps, I do this, since the music influence the truest
I shoot 'em with rhymes, execute 'em with lines
They knew since their kind is all stupid
Beats we loop it then they cue it, they foolish
And I stand to prove it this time, come on


Cuz it's new year, best to come correct
I ain't hear a style that I can't do yet
I ain't hear a rapper, that I can't move yet
Get off the wall and do the damn thing
Get on the floor and do the damn thing

I see it, then write it, believe it, I'm psychic
The nicest is here, the rest of those cats
They was last year, well do something...
I heard it, the beefs, the murders, the streets
The cursin', that's weak, do something
Different, for instance, the Priest is brief
A technique, I proves my point, with the pen and some gin
Thoughts and beats, I'm blendin' it in
My records will spin, everybody knows the kid can flow
Rip a show, or lift a soul, but this time, I gets that dough
Plus I'm not, 50, or Biggie, or Diddy
I'm Witty Unpredictable, lyrical masterful mind
Chapters of rhymes, irresistible lines, metaphors is clever than yours
Sever your jaws, I'm ready for war
Like Pac in his Makaveli era, ready for ya'll, with a Glock
And rap to spread to deadly terror, I squeeze on this whole industry
Enemies please don't sit with me

Places I’ve Been,View From Masada,2000,"Yeah, take it back, in the days
You know, of reminising
Just, just chillin
Word
Late at night, ah shoot its damn near morning
Check it out
From shootouts at block parties, from God Bodies
That flooded the project lobbys, cold degrees
Smokin weed, talkin 'bout the black and latin seeds
Durags and universal flags
On the ave little niggas throwin up tags
They get defeated, almost bit the broken tree
I recall, niggas who was nice in basketball
Just as my nephew, he had a gift that was special
But instead at least seein him with a scholarship
I'm lookin at him in the funeral parlor and shit
Life is a bitch, some go down, tryin to make it rich
Some say ""fuck it"", and start takin shit
Sometimes I wish, when bullets are sprayed, the fake niggas get hit
Cuz you know, we know
When you lose something that you really love, is hard to replace it
But we have to face it till the day we lay

From niggas I've seen, places I've been
Have my share of fake friends, ran with evil men
Chillin with the snakes is a sin
But through it all, I kept it real within

From the giggles of a murderer, or the hugs of a burglar
So many faces tryin to read us, I need an interpreters
In these dark dreams, where the car thieves lurk
Around the park, Jeeps, NARCs creep
At night the sharks eat, streets is so cold
As if they hearts don't beat
From niggas with tanktops, yellin bank stop
At night they fight like gang cops
Wet eachother like rain drops
And keep sinnin till the game stop
Until there's no longer breathin
Shit at last the soul is leavin
They goin nowhere fast
Tryin to escape this life is a difficult task


To the little niggas on the corner holdin their dicks
Rollin in clicks, had to get control in their strips
I ain't provin shit, bad asses cuttin classes
You need your ass split, maybe that will save you from that casket
And I copped the blast quick, with young black males of black bastard
See those niggas who trigger happy?
Maybe they will take the lives of mad niggas' daddy
I know it sound harsh, but I gotta kick it like this
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it
Go to save the righteous
And your ass walk around here lifeless
Trust me, I know it, you say I'm psychic
When the order hits its gonna be a crisis
And believe me, I ain't gonna be concerned who's the nicest
We made a crack sale, away the next fighters
When you look up and see that sky lit, you will know Christ lives
So until the next time, or if there is one
Check for the jewel, I left deep in your eardrum
Be aware, and stay awake, because we got to watch the snakes


Know I'm sayin? We gotta wake up motherfuckers
We gotta sit together
Word, you know?
For all my motherfuckin, gigantic army
And just, you know, being together
The sky looks like Coney Black, nigga
Be aware
Yeah, fuck that shit",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-places-ive-been-lyrics
The One,Priesthood,2001,"In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth

(Never met a force) I am the one
(Never met a force)
(Metaphysically in the state of euphoria)
Behold, I am the one
(You are the one)

Within dark heavens, hands open up books
Billion eyes stare before 'em as the audience look
Cosmic lights, it's gothic in the midst of the night
A state of nothingness, a shear bliss descended from heights
From gases, I'm drifting to a liquid to ice
Becoming frozen, the one who was chosen for life
It was I, just a spirit transended from Ja
The 7 heavens, the sixth plain, they switching my brain
I'm like ""Damn, I'm being transformed to man from angel""
I thought it'd be painful, then he reached down his hands
Forming the sands, ""Let us make man and stand until the land
Let's make him dynamic after our likeness
Making him psychic, seeing it was right with our conscience
In our own image, but let's give him limits
Thus his needs for seeds and his womens
And I will plant his emblem to bring him back in rememberance
In time to come, for he was told 'I am the one, I am the one'""

(You are..)
(Never met a force lead to metaphys
Metaphysically in a state of euphoria, euphoria)
(Never met a force lead to metaphys, in a state of euphoria, metaphysically)
I am the one
(We were tight back then)
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
I am the one, behold

So there I was, flesh and blood, black mud on my face
Naked I came from a celestial plain descended from space
In a distance, my existence was fallen from grace
And in an instant, became an infant, I will fall in this place
Called Earth, made of plant, rock, water, and dirt
And a name that I forgot, was called Walter at first
They cut my umbilical cord, a toddler
I learned how to scribble on floors, I got older
And learned how to dribble a ball
Until the controller opened up my spiritual door
My brain novas and out my mouth, the lyrics will pour
I was born with a seven on my chest, ya'll decipher the rest
It's just begun, because ya'll will know soon
I am the one, behold, I am the one

(Tight as the snug of your embrace)
(We still got the love that fills this place)
(I've held in your arms, but never squeezed too tight)
(Never met a force metaphys
Metaphysically in a state of euphoria, euphoria)
I am the one
(Never met a force lead to metaphys, in a state of euphoria, metaphysically)
(Be yourself if you want the best, be yourself)
(Ask them what we did and when we did it, they'll say 'fuck 'em up')
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
Behold, I am the one
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
(How late do you have to be before you're absent?)
(In your indos and in your outdos)
(This is, is all a war, as it is, so shall it be)
(If being is what it's about, I is)
(If being is what it's about, I is)
(What goes up, has to come down)",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-one-lyrics
The Devil’s Eulogy,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"They all attend, his demons, evil spirits, lord of the wind
Fallen angels, black abyss, bought most of his friends
His coffins full of abortions
Outside the black temple, dragons were swarmin'
Enormous, abomination came wit the children of Cain
Damnation and hell join hands
Black rain that anoints to his blood clan
Blasphemous near his casket weepin'
Comin' in multitude of demons, lost souls
Followed by a mass of heathens
Complainin', crows were screamin'
Then somethin' parted the rain
The stars changed
Ultimate light entered the room as God came
His face had my face and half of the entire human race
He walked in God dimensions and God thought
God on looks, God talks, the quiet sung dark musically
Sung dark musically, they read the devil's eulogy
From the end of heaven and Earth, came one walkin'
A thousand year curse, talkin'
From the direful of abyss
His wife leans over kisses his hard dead lips
The room smells like burnt sofa
Above his body, a tall gothic sculpture
Scriptures were written by Hitler
Stalin, Darwin and Idi Amin
The ET's arrive on the scene
I stood in the back, it was new to me
The devil's eulogy, they read it
They read the devil's eulogy
I read the devil's eulogy

Uh, uh
Just walk with me in this world
Fire with me in this world
Walk with me in my shoes
Uh, yo

Leaping through the wormholes bussing at cyber cops
Behold the pale president; clap 'em fifty-nine shots
Evidence of the aliens, footprints of the Sasquatch
Duck from the Cyclops, creep up the side Glocks
With America's cookbook, that's when my hood took
The recipe for thieves, and how to be a good cook
From angels to agents
To prophets to politicians in the kitchen
The melting pot new edition
The evil that men do, let it brew in the stew
Blood on Bush apron, Planet of the Apes again
Human race is dead, they get gray skin
Satan slay men, amen
The ravens pick the flesh from the bones
The streets alone, I click on my chrome
Touring with God and I sit on my throne
Bitches sucking dick, niggas nuts hit
Get 'em pregnant, send 'em presents
I get arrested, I confess, it's so majestic
I hold my open for Armageddon
Is my armor shredded? By the claws of Esau
The frozen BEAST then thaw
Now we finally meet at war, once more
Guns for anybody with the devil's arithmetic
Across his head and wrist
The predicament, the predicate's shoot at the president
Got evidence that he's prejudice
My residence switch, I move with unlisted phone numbers
David Ik's said there's clones of mothers
Its raining fire, skeletons drop stones upon us
Leaders of the Lost Ark, peaceful fingers
Across harps strumming, the end is coming
The plague, the angels blowing trumpets
We fight the BEAST along with his corruptions

We fight forever nigga!",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-shadows-lyrics

Was it sincere with them feelings you brought
Kept it conceal, now you double-cross
We made vows, now I have to pay for a child and stay on trial
Baby we wild, all I can do is through you a sick smile
Fair well, hope you get ya share hell
What you thought, we didn't have to go through nothing?
What you afraid of losing something?
It's suppose to be u-s not the whole USA
You gon' regret this day, it's betrayal

Yo, all these niggas out here backbitting and snitching
Told the FEDS I stashed weed, mad blow in the kitchen
See me coming out the truck with a four in my grip
They was pointing at me, looking at my gear and my kicks
Peep this kids that I stuck up, and told 'em I did it
My niggas be smiling in my face and knowing they wicked
Send songs to the police, man, get 'em a plaque
Smile like a bud-head nigga, his mouth is the crack
Blowing the dice, stabbing straight in the back
Niggas smoke crack, stick niggas up when it's track
Watch how they run backwards, dirty like a fuck
You be seeing the rats
Sitting in the car with the boys that sneak out the door
They got photos of the clique when we was pitching the raw
Somebody telling, they giving up crazy information
Tryna parole the kid, but I'm already on probation
Witnesses at the police station
Laughing while they cover their faces

And those people you trust... yeah y'all be joking and stuff
Next thing you know you smoking on dust
They switched the blunt when you asked for a puff
Watch you get open and laying in the cut
Wearing ya luck, now you off guard and extract
Now you stuck, it ain't real when you tryna hit ya man's wiz
Tryna go up in the ribs, while he doing a bid
Crab snakes they backstab and left the knife break
Smile at you with a tight face
How you dig a man like that?
How you feel as a man as a rat?
How you not gon' handle the gat?
How you wait and see I'm falling in the trap?
It's not real, it's not real, if you are how you feel
It's not real, if you with the homies
But you making side deals
It's not real, if you won't blast the steel
Or grab the wheel, or take a hand for the bill

Whut Part of the Game? (feat. Ras Kass),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Ras Kaas)
Oh so you a killer now?
What part of the game is that?
O so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
So you sold mad drugs?
O so y'all gangsters now?
What part of the game is that?

First of all everybody can't mc
Second of all, y'all all sound wack to me
Third y'all sound like a group of wannabes
Either it's 2Pac or another B.I.G
Here's the truth for you rappers, be your self
But y'all scared to do that, 'cause won't see no wealth
Matter of fact when y'all leave the ring leave those belts
I ain't gonna stop till every word is felt
See most of y'all cats never bust no gats
And most of y'all cats never sold no crack
And most of y'all cats better thank God for rap
Cause most of y'all left the hood and can't come back
Believe that, niggas ain't trying to see no plaques
Specially if your pockets are fat and theirs is flat
Niggas like an applause, ever heard of gun clap
Ever heard that click clack, rat a tat tat
Damn money what part of the game is that?
So y'all gangsters now?
What part of the game is that?
O so now y'all thugs?
What part of the game is that?
O you sold mad drugs?
What part of the game is that?
O so you killers now?
What part of the game is that?
O you gangsters?
What part of the game is that?
You gotta be something
What part of the game is that?
O you a hustler?
What part of the game is that?
See a lot of y'all cats never been upstate
So why you getting mad and all bent out of shape
Gangster rap? Come on y'all was on roller skates
And now ya trying to blow up on the next man's mistake
I've been broke too long to let a nigga rob me
Be up in your lobby, at least 5 deep
Creep in your crib and pop 5 in your sheet
Pop another one nigga trying to rob me
We ride in these streets, survive in these streets
Niggas get high, niggas die in the streets
Fuck that, I roll up on the side of your jeep
In the range asking for change, hiding my heat
Get smart, I let one fly through your seat
Through your heart, leave a nigga lying beneath
2000 who wanna side with the Priest
And I'm lounging all my niggas playing for keeps
Chorus:
Oh so you Biggie now?
What part of the game is that?
Nah you think you Pac?
What part of the game is that?
Oh you a warlord now?
What part of the game is that?
Hey yo Ras tell em
What part of the game is that?

I'm live evil, I know live people
Anxious to bang you wit heavy metal like Magneto
Now who really on some gangster shit?
Not every nigga with a stomach tattoo, bandanna and a click homey
You ain't dope just 'cause you sniff it, or lace ya blunt with it
That just makes you a wack rapper and a drug addict, get it
These niggas rhyme like they AK spray shit
Sell a ki of yay shit, gotta ride, homicide, every single day shit
Get smacked in the streets by some real nigga who don't play shit
Hit the pavement screaming it's just entertainment
And that ain't it, life sucks like fumigation
My obligation, expose all you funny bunnies
Rappers acting slash fudge packing for the money
'Cause next week if the new fad was hip hop fags
You'll find a lot of these thug niggas in drag, believe that
Oh so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
Nah you a gangster
What part of the game is that?
Oh now you a killer
What part of the game is that?

Militant,Black August: Revisited,UnKnown,"It's too militant, it's too militant
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo

Aiyo, we night breathe, move through the night at light speed
With Timb's on, baggy denims and white tees
We rest inside our tents, with Mr. Lightly
The right trees turn my eyes to Chinese
Then speak like Israelite, become Christ
A crown of thorns placed on my head and gun fights
Escape through the night, for holdin' my sons tight
Chased by shadows, runnin' towards the lights
Relatin' to pharaohs, I speak from peace pipes
Each night, then you burn all friends of 'dro
Givin' praises due, abundance of dough
Held by the ebony prince, heavenly set
Down to the streets where we plan our revolt
Amongst strangers, and clouds of weed smoke
Addicts and heartless that love to deep throat
I sit amongst goons, gangsta, ex-felons
Ex-cons, addicts discussin' our rebellion
On the phone with reverends, holdin' up my weapons
Waitin' for the beast to set off Armageddon

It's too militant, throw your gats up
Nigga, wanna act up, nigga get clapped up, what
It's too militant, throw your fists high
Let that catch a whip ride, nigga, we split five, why

It's too militant..
I shoot through trench coats, don't trust kin folks
Keep my friends close, so I can watch 'em
Through hard laughter, never know what he's plottin'
Hunger, then he slipped his hands in your pockets
Clip your wallets, it's nothin' personal, it's just projects
Watchin' a videotape of Christopher Wallace
Footage exposed, bullet holes in the side of his jeep
We hold it in, 'til we collide with police
Ride for 2Pac, and all the soldiers every been shot
Though they body rot, they spirit rest inside of my pen
Each of 'em tune in, I write the Blueprints that's Stillmatic
Build with Arabs, my mic can heal the masses
Or feel the caskets, I studied the books of Iron Octopus
Ladies ride the hook, niggas spit the verses
A pit of serpents, stand and curved in a s shape
Then I make your death date
I'm hell spawned, drawn near the Hell's gate
The Indian lady warned me an old man, with pale face
She said ""Fork tongue make painful kisses
And Priest, when you talk, all the angels listen""

The North Story,The Eternal Thought of Killah Priest (Bootleg),2009.0,"Desert Storm type nights above
Hajji state of mind I'm drifting, tripping, I'm tied up
Blindfolded Vietnam culture close in with blowing torches
Above us the portraits of the Last Supper
I'm coughing up blood, Priest where's 'The Offering'?
A voice of the madame heard through the soft wind
Chased by the hateful words of the town's people
Deep within the walls of a brown cathedral
I look up blood in my eyes, veins showing through my skull
The flickering light bulb
I'm straining as my eyes bulge
This is my last reaction for peace
As the assassins let their Nines release
I hop out my chair running in slow motion
Hail of bullets sailing like a boat floating
I'm going nowhere

A North Story, it's a quiet murder

I fell, release my last revelation
Spoke of corruption and mass devastation to the world's nation
Let go of my masters, I that brother Priest speak of offerings
Tides I bring, 
Nines they ring, knives I swing
The skies turn black, the streets flood with blood
Statues crack, the rain fell from above
In the shape of heroin needles, hailing down crack vials
Blunt smoke so thick it's hard to see through
Then all the real niggas who died open their eyes
And all the real hip-hopers crawl out their graves
Come meet the witch doctor, lightning strikes the cave
Through my bullet holes I bleed scrolls
Written by the lost souls on the crossroads
Look at the heavens talk to the crones
My thoughts are scary, talk to skeletons inside of mortuaries
I preach peace at the Devil's feet before I'm buried
I hope the Lord is ready, my sword is steady, my aura's heavenly

Let the monks in the monasteries bring it in
I have a story to tell

Well this is it, gravity keeps grabbing me
I'm losing sanity, I'm gradually tryna get up
But I can't, look ahead, I see bright lamps
And the ground underneath seems quite damp
I sink in, I begin swimming towards this image
I venture off into different dimensions
My cosmic body begins the twisting
And stretching all further into the essence
This is not for the thug, this is not for the streets
This only for the thug and the streets that think deep
Priest I quantum leap, 
woolly hair and bronze feet
Cosmic, Gothic lights, through air pockets beyond heights
Star collapse black holes, I flap with the wings of a bat
Tail of a tadpole, rest with the pharaohs and wake with the 
King David
Seen naked entering into a green spaceship
I'm like the comets Christ, garments white
The smoke hand lift the tomb lid then the smoke seeps in
Priest beginning, Priest ending, Offering",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-north-story-lyrics
Diagnose,Elizabeth,2009.0,"My pen's compulsive, obsessive
It never gives itself enough credit
It's explosive, Ritalin should do it
Odd behavior, with the bars on paper
When I write to this music, reactions
It's like sadness, to laughter
Though I'm spitting classics
The thoughts of madness, it gives me asthma
Rather than think, it sinks into deep depression
Deeper questions, performing neurosurgery
Words in 3-D, its sick disease discovered
It slowly occurs to me
Go into ya ashtray and light a roach
The test results are back
Let's see what I'm diagnosed or why I wrote this rap

My paper keeps gaining weight, fat shit
Like this the bars might break
The diet pills in my writer's skills
Should I put the mic back down and wait?
Not good for the heart, caffeine sixteen's
Raps need more greens, when it eats, know what I mean
Sentence experience hemorrhage, lyrics insulin
Hydrocodone pen, oxycodone toxin when I spit hot wind
With alphabets that connect syllables
Ill individual, I spit visual, lyrical
Go in ya ashtray and find the roach
Hear the results, I'm an addict
Addicted to the mic, here's the diagnose

The flow don't have enough sodium
It leaks, that's why I speak from podiums
I teach, two weeks have me on opium
I wrote it 4pm
Last night a glass pipe mic detach from life
Dependency, since my entrance
Instrumental CD's, influent sixteen's
I'm trafficking rap
Shootouts with my mind to get it back
I got it like that, it's in my luggage
As soon as I begin my subject
I finally can go public
Pay the stewardess on my mental plane
Go thru customs, I might buss one
If the beat feels the same
Receive testimonies from past fiends
Rakim spoke, I listened, took notes
But when it's my time to speak
Something got caught in my throat
It's not fair cuz I'm still using
Sorry y'all but the street music
Go in ya ashtray and light a roach
I got the results
And laid back and read the diagnose

The talk of women, brought from the star system
Dynamic emergence, wordsmith within his turban
Tats of the Virgin, power of planets emerging
Back from hell's furnace, born again, torn from sin
Broke the spell out of my shell, call the hermit
We're twirling books like Merlin within the firmament
The perfect balance, I hold my chalice
Accept ya challenge, I won't budge
Hardwood thugs with hammers and Timb boots and gloves
Woven the greatness, flowing with blood
That's just the basics
After I spit you'll see the Matrix
My heart restored with war, my grape's the realness
My wine of pillage, sip between lines made of pillars
Under his feet the word ""Killah""
So print this out of ya data zone
Priest returns home, battlezone nigga!

Surrounded by a sculpture of women
Antisocial when I wrote this rhythm
The vultures got in them, gave us hope at the ending
Game is sour like the Pope of a lemon
My hand's a gram; I put dope in each sentence
Energize rhyme, electromagnetic, genetics
We writing esoteric, y'all could see the signs
I did what I could do, from the animal woods environment
The hood to analyze it, y'all could see the God designing
Deep minded, I stay rooted, sage music
Plus strokes of touch, your ghost hugs and shows
They love it yo; I do it for the souls, c'mon!

Raps raise the blood pressure
Customize rhymes to fit ya mind size
Difference between suicide notes or love letters
The light between my eyes enterprise
Rid you of mental waste toxins in ya doctrine
This oxygen is space
While ya head blows I pop ya face
Take loads off ya mind and do lunge
A newer army, flood the world like tsunamis
The greatest gift, from dark towers, Excalibur
He's down, now who's the next challenger?
That's when death surrounds ya
Desert Eagle peck ya by the silencer
Indirectly, diary, words are fiery
Thru the eyes of Reed
Thru a tube there's I.V. creating magic
In some minutes or some seconds on the record
In the sentence my pen wand shoots stars out of measure
P's God, I rhyme, cause pressure
Mind's the treasure; they call me water-head

Nah, its Walter again y'all, Priest is on his death bed

Inhale a thick aroma of reefer
The blunt ash falls at this moment I'm deeper
Zonin', writin' poems, headphones on, completes the cipher
I'm eager to reach the youth as a writer
The truth is inside us, the beautiful mother
Who's wiser? Darker the skin, the more the appetizer
Amplify their eyes wide shut
The 85ers can't recognize us
They won't get it; we live to its limits
Her jewels are endless
The food polish pearls wit friction
The world infliction, addiction
As the Earth twirl out in space, suspended
Animation expensive, canvas paintings by Claude Monet
You're in the streets all week but wit the Lord Sunday
It's more gunplay, more funerals
More young graves, the usual
Heard Marvin Gaye or Big Pun say
""It's so haaaaaaaarrrrrrdddd!""

You a soldier wit grenades wit the pin
The wages of sin is death
The greatest offence is deaf
Wait, you enter in as a guest
But you want, revenge or respect

So here's a tribute for judges gon' mute
We salute, fire congress Smith for tellin' the truth
Cheers to the system felon on you
Rebell or get loose, here's to the troops
Mandatory suspension
This goes out to the cameras wit the bad lenses
No love for the hands branded wit sixes
Peace to the man-hand wit the crucifixes
I know Lucifer's listenin'
Peace to Black Jesus
The Black Jesus that relates to wave cap and sneakers
The Black Jesus that won't judge either
Cuz he knows about the back of the bus and why we buss heaters
In him we trust, plus he's a thug to keep us from locked up
Or shot up, we love Black Jesus
And for the people that say he ain't a saint
He right there wit us in the clank
And only thing that make 'em cry is the white paint
Black Jesus, I saw 'em packin' a stima
Not to kill you, but he knows it's real too
We love you Black Jesus, he'll neva sell out
At the White House, matter of fact he might get kicked out
Cuz he wants the hood to hear what's he's talkin' about

Arms open wide

Give me answers to the when, where, how, and why

That my peers was here before me

Do you know the color of murder?
Do you understand what the color of murder is?
(You'll be written out the will of Priest)
It's what I write, this is Priesthood
Neo... You know, Angel of...

Yo, my ink bleeds fatigues on paper
Place it on gangstas, beneath light poles
I write scrolls of hood tales
My tight flow's a blood trails of ink
I dreamt of rhymes and crayons, color to spray on
Brothers, my rap is like drawn book of crooks
To sing along wit covers, made from concrete
Open, it in ciphers, I paint flows
As they come off the Prophet tongue
I rock a King's robe, holdin' my papa's gun
My metaphors is hard like the feathers on thorn
Helmet, it's Leo' Di's letter, dawg
Rockin' bluish velvet, this man is no rapper
The pen in his hand is used to cast a spell
Black Israel, my fist hail like the Panther
Laugh at rappers like they stand-up
The man gon' hand touch my gat
And my words are, the colors of murder
(Hook) 2x
He's like Michael Angelo wit the flow
Or Leonardo Da Vinci, his pen squeeze like a burner
It could hurt y'all, and these are the colors of murder

I sat my pages wit the poison pen
My choice of gin is anything earlier than 1600's
Hell of a stomach, I take straight shots from the shells of gunman
Invade your block wit elephants comin'
Like Hannibal comin' from Carthage
But it's more like the Priest comin' from his projects
Load the cartridge in my marker
And my pen is a scope, check the murder I wrote
The flow gets darker (What's the color dawg?)
Two cups of Dracula's blood
Three teaspoon, a goon, a gat and a couple of thugs
A small funeral room, a fitted cap and a ice mug
The skies color of maroon
Where young brothas doomed
Over crack, his shoulder shrug
The little brotha went too soon
From a hot bullet, from a burner
Wonder if he suffered?, I don't know
But I write the color of murder
(Hook) 2x
(Interlude)
This is it, the colors of murder
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, I laugh at ya rappers man
Yo, y'all niggas gon' make me laugh son
Yo, this is the color of murder now I'm writin'
Check it out, uh, uh, uh - ha-ha-ha-ha

Fuck y'all rappers, I love to war
What do you think all my armor's for
Take ten paces back, then draw
But the draw dunn revolves wit the pen
Colors that blend, the complex to your end
Dress me as your Highness
If you get me mad, throw you in my wine-press of my wrath
Now I'm drunk from the grapes of violence
I sip the colors from the Devil's chalice
Chemicals imbalance, and my brain, migraines
I can't go further, and my words are, the colors of murder
(Outro)
Dawg, the colors of murder
Get 'em in the righteous circles
Tear these rappers in half
I ripped my book apart
This is it, told you I could write it
The colors of murder
Color this, and color the bullets and color the thugs
Whatchu mean? What is it?, What do you mean?
I just finished writin' these colors of murder
It's gon' be so good, what rhymes wit hematopenic
What blends, I need the words, to just match
Gotta attach this to that, sorry
What did you say? I have to finish this
The color of murder
Sincerely yours: Priest, leads of Lards
The Duke of Larks, the Duke of the hood nigga",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-color-of-murder-lyrics
Walts Day Out,Planet of the Gods,2015,"VERSE I
My ADD
You know it got the best of me
ADHD it got me feeling free
And I'm happy as I wanna be
But my head is so spacey
And I'm laughing while the preacher is talking to me
And I'm laughing while the counselor is talking to me
They say ""You're not serious enough
Walter Reed"", as I take a puff
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke
I see the government as a joke
Peeping his emotions through the weed smoke
One by one the squirrels steal my sanity, now I need hope
HOOK
Right over left (x7)
Good over evil
Hallelujah, praise is king
Is it James, is it Lutheran or Constantine?
Just copped us a jar of weed, puff and pass with the homies (x2)
VERSE II
So wake the heavens
Shake the Earth for the sun has smirked
And the moonlight on our beautiful dirt
I'm just high, watching it go by, just watching it go by
And the preacher said ""Let the church sing and say Amen""
I'm just high, passing some Hen
So let the people rise
With our palms to the skies
Rejoice to the Most High
But really, we're the most high
I punched Ty
The usher sees us
In disgust she says ""Jesus""
Grabs us by the collar
Kick us out the church
I seen the tray, I leave a dollar, put God first
The stars burst, look up
The sky is rainbow colors
A dog walks by and said ""Hello""
I said ""Good doggy"", he said ""Good fellow""
Now tell me there ain't happiness in the ghetto
HOOK
VERSE III
Listen up, boys and girls, this is the mystery
They shoved in the pockets of history
See, God's a tailor for fabric of existence is sewn
And now it's shown
Psalm 147 and 4
Mount Seri
Under the stronghold
The base of the Anunnaki
The mass planet decays into anarchy
Alien strong hold remote
Views and army control
Watch files
Who design the Adam to be
The covering protector of Eve
Built a Martensite city
With Hematite glass windows
Precise formula restore mankind
Precise formula restore mankind",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-walts-day-out-lyrics
Born 2 Die,Behind the Stained Glass,2008,"I'ma live, I'm gonna live, I'ma fly, I'm, gonna fly
I'ma live, I'm gonna live, I'ma fly, I'm, gonna fly

""Whosoever therefore humble themself as this little child"" (Matthew 18:4)
The saying was the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven
Wings on the ledge and felt his way home, he sings with his brethrens
Flapping away through the air, white and seems like the pheasants
But supreme in his presence, a king in his essence of woe
Unto the world because are office is corrupt
And false justice broke peace we bought the beast amongst us
Grief of a hustler, beef between brothers
To reap what we suffer
There's cancer inside, we eat off each other
Growing in us like a tumor, false rumors
Up at the tree like a puma on the night of a lunar
We fight here comes the goons of out we live and you die
They sent the apes into space
To plant new life for the lead of only one race
Gun chase make our sons erase, some deteriorate
Evaporate from flesh to spiritual bodies
The masters of fate, still clash us with fate
The mirrors are godly, pardon me

I'ma live, I'm gonna live, I'ma fly, I'm gonna fly
I'ma live, I'm gonna live, I'ma fly, I'm gonna fly

Ever seen me fly, that's me
Ever seen me cry, I see
The dreams of a land I, I need
Four REASONS TO JAMROCK, I MEAN
Poor reasons the more breathing
The more achieving, the more BELIEVING
Then the more reaching, I MEAN
Usual cats stay forth eating
PUT A PLAN TOGETHER, couple of meals together now they all eating

So, ""Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones
Before I say that to you the Heaven and the angels
Do always behold the face of the father
Which is in heaven and the son of man is coming
Save those which is lost"" (Matthew 18:11)
WOW, let that sink in your thoughts
This is a force, a movement, a blueprint of the true prince
We're the remnants of Israelite descendents
We all kindred's, cross out you mimics
Follow the lineage of Genesis
To the prisoners, to all my listeners
Remember my affliction to my sister's addiction
To my spirit conviction, to my sister conditions
To my soul collisions, to my sister's soul submission
I'm here baby girl and through me ye still living
Feel me",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-born-2-die-lyrics
Power Freestyle,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"Flyin' in my spaceship, seven-hundred
Niggas in lobbies, they gettin' blunted
Who want it? The power's comin'
Spelled P.W.O.W.R
The bloodiest bars, the ugliest scars
On the face of my apes
Niggas climbin' the gates
Banana clips, hammers on hips
Niggas put you in the box or a brace
Mack-10 tongue, spit shot to ya face
So fuck a love lock down
Before all the thugs are locked down
This is drugs I jot down
Hip-Hop's back on the block now
And real rap is back now
My mic will spray round
So ga'head and spit
So I can tell you how many germs is in your breath
How many brain cells you destroyed
And how many you have left
So I can tell you about space and depth
While you stuck on your wages, my shit is more outrageous
Laugh at you, your shit's more outdated
So ga'head talk about your cash
I'll tell you about the Stock Market crash
Mash, my raps are enormous
Spendin' your money on cars, you better spend it on a coffin
This is digital offering
Lyrical offspring, my spirits is callin'
Stompin' you roaches, niggas still crawlin'?
Nigga, your brain don't produce data
You're an old program, Priest is major
You're not a killer, an ape or a gorilla
You're soft, sorta like a chinchilla
Break ya chin like a mirror
A thousand years of bad luck
You and your crew can hit my Mack trucks
Your rap sucks, times up, grind y'all in a dutch
Roll it like a flip it in the garbage
Fuck wit Priest is cool, but my flow is HIV positive

I don't know
The Psychic World of Walter, come to the slaughter
Come to his daughter, the Virgin
How it feels to be under the surgeon
Antibiotics, but the shit ain't workin'
Blood plasma monitors, all your breathings
24-hours of cameras, you ain't got stamina",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-power-freestyle-lyrics
M.E.,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"I only love me, listen to myself being me
Egotistical but praise myself for being original
I sit in my own glory, create my own worlds
Write then read my own stories
Neva met the gates made of pearl
There's nothin' after and nothin' before me
Since a shorty I'm overconfident
I see myself in a higher consciousness
Marble water bowl, my holy palms I rinse
Wardrobe then I place my palms on my prints
My seed came from me, no Immaculate Conception
Just royal mattresses, sexin' - I am perfection
A narcist artist, conscience, I am the comet
I am the crown and the garment
I am God and the Devil
Self-interest is self concern
And I meet on no other terms
A king by himself who serves himself
I am so hot my servents melt
The sun is jealous of me
The moon hides her face
It's just me alone writin' in space
32 paths of wisdom, seven forms of God
600 universes under each arm
God's existence, God's sense, God's presence
The first being the cause of causes
The answers to y'all questions
And this is my lesson
(Hook) 2x
I am so selfish when I write
I'm rebellious wit the mic
I'm the jealous type
Bipolar disorders
The mic leave me - I'ma stalk her
It was given to me like God gave the Torah

It give me mood disorders, sadness, hopelessness
I can only focus on it
I gotta grab it, I wrote it on disc
The only thing that relieves my pain like dopamine
Push a record company, find a ghostin'
Cop it, find an empty studio and wrote a 16
It's like a dream when it enters the bloodstream
Can't sleep - insomniac, my palms react
It's an anti-compulsive, make my muscles relax
I wrote a couple of raps then the trouble comes back
Euphoric, brain waves ignites, I can see the orbits
It's not around me, I'm drowsy, I use it in the toilets
A warm rush, my face goes flush
My mic is clutch followed by a light touch
Then I see a thousand palace's of longin'
A ladder of prayers up a spiral of stairs
The writer is here, I don't need a rope or dope
Just a key from piano cane and cuts from a musical note
Look a beautiful flow, I seen the End of Days
Bent up graves, the rival of the Messiah
7,000 new Bible's, the creation of the third temple
The destruction of the simple, the rise of Heavy Mental
Hieroglyphics written on a side of an asteroid
Wit my pictures in 'em, twirlin' towards Earth
Pass, avoid, I'm swirlin' my verse like Merlin in Church
Burnin' Bush of books, read, see a people of Egyptian, inscription
My name threaded in needle, embroidery
Recorded to seduce about his forgery
Here to chew the rap lord then I leave
(Hook) 2x
(Outro)
Yeah, this is what all is about
It's all about me, kno'I'mean
When I write it's all about me
It's all about you too, kno'I'mean
Just gotta give yourself time, kno'I'mean
Be yourself some time being about you
When I write it's about me, kno'I'mean
Me and this pen, me and this pad
This beat from Woool, kno'I'mean
So we can zone out",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-me-lyrics
Dead,Elizabeth,2009.0,"(Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light)
""It is a time when Magic is more powerful than Science
And only those who control the Magic, control destiny
They are the Visionaries.""
""Visionaries, Knights of the Magical Light
Visionaries, with Magical Powers they fight
Powers of mind, strength, skill, 'n' speed
Powers to accomplish the greatest of deeds
Visionaries, Knights of the Magical Light.""

Killers with assault rifles, street or cult rivals
One clique called ""The Hogs"", other's called ""Disciples""
Animosity flavor the air, tasted raw beef
Seasoned with wrong reason, the heat will flare
He let it cook for 380 degrees, .9mm's will squeeze
Those with no jewels found their nose in the soup
They handling cheese, full of holes
That's what they do to rat's tails in the trap
Pulling hammers, some get nailed with the pack in jail
They meet the cat, squeeze ya gat

Yeah, he's dead
Two to the head
The street's not fair
No love loss, no last here
Bring me back some dutches
And the 40 & beer soon as shorty appear

You see cat name ""Big Shoe""
Kept a nine off the safety while watching the news
About these two dudes he knew
Black and Scott, damn they got knocked
By this undercover cop
Yeah I remember it now
Scott told me how it was gon' go down
Said he knew the bitch was a cop
Had the nine in a box
But after they plot
They gon' have that bitch popped
His girl said he was stupid
Told her if she ever left 'em he would lose it
A rough knock at the door
He got in the position as he was shooting
It's his homeboy, said ""Damn you scared me""
Open up nigga, niggas just aired P
In downstairs now doin' u'wees
Fuck that, drop the nine and grabbed the Uzi


The nigga Conan knocked out a horse on the fall for New York
That was the hood talk
That was like '87, Reagan had the destine
Streets still tryna adjust in
Little Bart use to walk around with two mac's
Sit in the park, vines would spark
He gave a few daps to Mark
Restless and peace
Every nigga who walk on the streets who wanna compete
Selling drugs cuz the world won't show 'em no love
And there's a God above us please hug us
Cuz they won't show us no justice
Please show ya face, we could all relate
The caskets and addicts
The hood takes a shape of a demon face (Damn!)
Dirty bastards, we got about six years on the street
Before we hurled in by police
Fuck it, we gon' hurl them in and the Beast",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-dead-lyrics
The God Within,Elizabeth,2009,"When I write I take the day
Pull it thru night, make the Earth explode
Than bring it back as a globe
There's light, scrolls unfold, rivers reverse
I picture the verse, first
When it's complete, its' from concrete
And the streets are deeper than universe
But still around me, gunshots, train stops
And one cop, who hates my guts
So many pages that I've written, my fingers developed paper cuts
Number stores, the stray dogs who chase the bus
Tickets in hands of old women who pray for luck
But when I will finesse my craft
Usually you can see a craft
Hovering the unknown, the tones
Light enters my bedroom, my pupils were red
When I looked up from my pad
Save the Lost Tribe from apartheids
That's you and I
More than the nation that the brothers hold up on that sign on that cardboard
This is what I rep God for
To all y'all next with a sharp sword
Bright words from the dark Lord
Now let's start war


You can see my notebook is my confession booths
Since my youth, all my corrections, fire loops
My connection's with the truth
My life, my stories
Holy water, OG talk of Walter, (the) author
Rise in glory, from being nailed to the pages, ageless
I'm immortal to rap, how you're atheist from facts?
I'm living proof, feel my wombs thru the booth
Relax, resurrections, the sun behind the moon from the roof
I gave y'all parables, incomparable, unimaginable
Hannibal upon an animal, the Mazateen, the Manateniam
Millennium, equilibrium, it's equal to lithium
Ether, either I'm eager to show you I'm deeper than any of them
When my spirit hand reach for the pen
It's God's body, I'm God soul, finding the God that's within

Let's start war...",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-god-within-lyrics
Gabriel’s Palace the Dybbuk,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"In the planet of Brooklyn, place mother starship voyage
Holdin' two boys, cosmic of other planets nevoid
Our space suits consist of apple jack hats and platform boots
Afros, cornrows, four in our group
Passin' Androids, Neanderthal, my system ran to the Panther hall
On our way to the plant, police drones
Shot laser guns, AR's E ones, hustlers scrabble their crumb
The canvas of our slums
I was just a lil infant wit my force shield
Observin' cross field
All the gangstas and all the thoughts were real
It was live, dress fly
How did I know that I will soon be his Jedi?

The pen in my hand was the lightsaber
Didn't know back then it would be my life savior
And when the young Knight took the mic it was major
He would recite words human shouldn't write on paper
Should've saw the bright quasars
Make the Earth look like the moon under the night craters
He battled cats that looked like Mad Max
Swung his lyrical axe wit arrows in his back
The Crying Freeman Lord, had the fist of the North Star
The War God, swung his sword hard
In parks, lobbies and school yards
The epic odyssey continue, his friends knew that he had somethin'
When he took he asked for nothin'
His fate became great and took the shape of Henry the VIII
Da Vinci they scraped, but who would've known?
From his Heavy Mentalist poem
That he would sit on the throne given to Jones (Nasir)
Amongst Rakim, carved in the stones
Big Daddy Kane clones and Jay, BIG and Pac once owned
Scarface, G-Rap, Rick, Blastmaster, half pillars in Hip-Hop's Rome
Method Man stands next to the Giza of GZA
Big Pun, Big L sit up in the ozone
Quasars of Cormega, Ras Kass, Canibus and AZ from the B.C
The Ghost of Ghost spoke and predicted Priest shall come in A.D
(Hook)

From gettin' started to his menu screen
Where we find his items contains the great warrior king
Stood beside 'em was a ghost hawk
Above 'em was a spirit hawk that swoop down and hear it can talk
Lyrics of thoughts, the odyssey
It all happens here in New York
The Bed-Stuy Jedi quickly transport to his station
Known as Brownsville, wearin' a white gown to his heel
The Messiah will squeeze fire, Ghetto Jezuz
Caesar transform the street attire
Got wit the Rose Family, Daddy Rose up in cheetah's
Wit classy Rose, bought a house out in Crown Heights
Brown stone on prospect
The God rest but there's more progress
Move out to Love Allah
Amongst the blood, cuz and the stars
Hollywood this is a long way from where his posse stood
This is probably good, the weather, weed and the waves
Sun lotion on the bathes, bikini straw-hat's and shades
Stood a nigga in Timbs, observin' the realm

Words From a Viking,The 3 Day Theory,2010,"A Heavy Mentalist and his penmanship took him to unlimited
Greatness some say
It was his spaceship others say
He was gracious in the way he spit
Brought God to an atheist
Bought wisdom to a pagan since 'Basic Instructions Before Leaving Evil'
Was formed from the Black Hebrews
But he trapped with his people selling crack living illegal
Strapped with desert eagles and would clap at judges, police too
Two sides to him, he would go to combat and was peaceful
This is more of his stained-glass writing on the Church window pane as a Viking
His name is Priest

I'm the rose and I give this to you
It tears my clothes and this life's so crucial
Prepare the road and my ride's in neutral
Beware of my soul cause my eyes see through you
And my eyes see through you
And my eyes see through you

Love and happiness, drug and marriages
Slugs from the ratchet spit
Secrets of the dead when that casket lift
Bullets left to pull bastard stiff
Mix messages, rich heritage
I come form the Hyksos araget
Six thousand miles through the strong currents
We survive with endurance
Made it through the waves, kid
Outrageous, put in cages
Slaves for ages
Something out of the Bible pages
What made our survival contagious?
Its tribal, species endangered
The rose with the cuts on his clothes
His pedals had fallen in the ghetto
Crowds echo, screams and I've seen the devil
Angels with the same clothes
(Chorus) 2x

Is it the seven in the crescent?
The G in the compass?
Reverend and his message?
It's me in a conflict
Star David - The Mosque or The Masons?
God or the Atheists?
Tomorrow are the ancients
Which way do I go? Which ways do I roll?
New age or the old?
Ways of the crow to the grave in the cold
Or to the grave in the soul with the sun-rays and I can grow
To the pavement in the road
God dealt with Nations so I deal with concentration
So deep in conversation
I reap for combination
Read Psalms when I'm shaking
Call moms when I'm aching
Push your palms when you praise him
My calm words drop bombs on Satan
Farrakhan's congregation
Escaping the longs arms of the state pens
Abomination taxes, television distractions
Her religion is backwards
Asking were they in these chapters?
Will it end with the rapture?
Or will we assail with the master?
Will the devil be captured?
Will the rebels have laughter?
Or will the ghettos be after?
From the baby showers to the grave with the flowers

Where my niggas break in cribs and we shake your kids
Turn 'em upside down, ""Where that bacon is?""

Cats get killed, wack until
I feel it's necessary to get wet in every
Spot from the Glock, drop two double oh's
In trouble your souls, three fifty seven mac 10, better
You say never, I say whatever, spraying berettas
Nothing protect ya, tear up your texture
Applyin' that pressure, it's my pleasure
Hit you from your neck up, I want that respect, what?

My Daughters,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"My daughters are bad; they kill men, record 'em then laugh
I require blood sacrifice, slaughter the calf
One name Ice, the other name Fire
Flames for hair, every pussy cloud desire
I spit 'em out in my image and finish
At the end of their sentence, these women are visions of Virgin
Two-trillion in my mouth, doin' service
Shaped like verses, seductive, darin', destructive
Flarin' over percussions, I spit dark forms of matter
The darkness that draws the atoms
The darkness that bonds the nucleus
That water, alkaline thru platinum
Within the uterus, I spit storms that scatter
Thru out the four corners of the Earth
Drawn from the universe darkness that exists
Before creation, stand before me when I spit
That's how I cremate 'em
(Hook)
My daughters are men, they're lesbian
But they only human when they come thru the pen
I call my verse the Virgin, pray to St. Mary before I begin
Is Priest superstitious or loose wit his vision?

The thought of my daughters is Horus performin
The chorus by August that make the forest hauntin' like stormin'
Around my brain is a black cloud
High temperatures rise from within
Pen snaps now, leaves fall from trees
My brain novas, mind alignin', the rhyme is science
Blind assignments, find excitement
It's like I'm typin' 700 words per second
Too much for this record to wreckage
Perfection, pestilence spreadin'
The usual settin' to a musical dead end
Your funeral, such a beautiful expression
Immovable presence of Priest, like pillars in Greece
No more Killah, just P, no iller emcee
(Hook)

Rebellious stars, fallen angels, hell in Mars
Tallest scales over thin shells of my bars
God and devil, life and death, results from ghetto
Mics and breath, Hip-Hop or techno
Bet those people feel me
Rap's a plant seed in the field G
Ants pack leaves in the hill B
Haters kick dirt till I'm filthy rich
Best flow, guilty, rap's a silky stitch

My used cum will stop at the drain

They dwell inside my brain cell
They tryna escape from the pen
Wait! You said that before and when I'm writin'
I know, but my flow got indicted
I make sure that the bars are unbreakable
Make sure the God is unreplaceable
Make sure his heart's unerasable
Make sure the stars are untraceable
Laws are unmistakable
Capable to take you to Galaxies
Just sit in silence then we'll leave
Look! We're here, just an idea
No travelin', just close ya eyes
And the whole place appeared
That's the speed of thought
Look! You're free to walk
93 millions miles from the Universe
See that little star up there that's Earth
WOW! You think there's life up there
It's just a theory, its gettin' weird
Hear me clear, my name is Adam
It's the evenin' of the day
I'm hungry, let's get somethin' to eat
Let's walk this way

Truth (Turn Off the Radio),Elizabeth,2009,"My life's a great witness to bitches and physics and mystics
Not to seem superstitious or too religious
Over great vengeance, but it seems like my pains was endless
So called-friends that I befriended
Stabbed me in the back with poisonous fixes
I heard this lady say ""It's our pre-born choices we experience""
So what's the decision and what's with the discovered urges?
One without water purges
Body inflames of discomfort
I'm too young for dumb whores but I want more
The battles inside, dust devils of bad luck ghettos
Twirling towards me, impels the pressure of mama's lecture
Coulda made my world end, the toxins were black as coffee
I take medicine for my Medisin
Nothing with ephedrine, deep where the spirits caught me
Turn off ya tv
Turn off ya radio
Turn off ya tv
Turn off ya radio
Turn off everything

Power the crime; I fall seven-thousand times
Haters doubted from behind, angels shouted when I rise
Cuz I'm suppose to shine
Those demons that coulda had me, surpassed me
God grabbed me, my darkest moments were approaching
I had to remain focused or wind up with the Jones' or homeless
Or a tombstone with my name inscripted
When bad luck called I spoke in other languages
As painful as it gets, I'm on top of a Topanga cliff
Stretching my arms for angels to lift
Surrounded by the atheist and told me...
""Curse God and die"", maybe mama hands me a rope for suicide
And gave me a gun of tongue, said you decide
Tied, hung, fried or crucified
What? Good! Let them all leave
I'll crawl on my knees but now it's all me
I found strength, eternity in the dreams I dreamt
Went to sleep a man, but in the morning a king that lift
The coon effect, sits in the womb of brother fly, caterpillar
The math of Killah, from a stomach, half butterflies
But now I'm back, to hover where I demise
Y'all had me trapped, but now y'all suffer inside
Blow with the dust where my wings flap, step back",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-truth-turn-off-the-radio-lyrics
Robbery,Black August,2003,"Yeah, you know I got to get this damn money, man
Nah, I can't take this this time
Everybody got the boy stressed, about to do somethin', you know
Trynna hold me back too long, try to get this money any way I could

Look, my cash nope, baby cryin'
Had enough, I grabbed my iron
Call up the crew, is what you do
Be in my spot, around two
Oh yeah, bring some guns, bring some mac's
I got a way, we can make some cash
My woman beefin', my momma sick
If I don't get it, look, I'mma flip
The doorbell ring, exchange some slang
We laughed a little, ya'll got them things
Okay thanks, now look here's the plan
Hold up, please, whose your man?
Oh him? That's, my man Sharod
Don't worry about him, that's the God
He specializes in gun firin'
Pickin' locks, ditchin' cops
And robberies, goes on, robbin' sprees
He's the, he's the man, here's the plan
Remember the bank, we at before
Well, he headed back to make a withdrawel

It's about to be a robbery (damn right, I'mma get it)
It's about to be a robbery (damn right, I'mma get it)
We about to catch a body (damn right, I'mma get it)
We about to catch a body (damn right, I'mma get it)

Three in the back, two in the front
Loaded up the gats, while we pullin' up
Here's the spot, let's make it pop
Anything move, we make it hot
Doors open, we put our masks on
Our gats poked, it won't take that long
Anybody grab me, I whispered softly
Do what you got to do, to get them off me
Hands twitchin', gettin' feelings
Saw the security, might have to kill 'em
Walk through the door, damn it's crowded
Walked on the floor, then shouted
(It's a robbery!) Everybody down
Don't make a move, don't wanna hear a sound
Looked a Sharod, gave me the nod
Let me know, I did my job


Told the teller, feel the bags
Had the mack, pointin' at the glass
Hurry up, you're movin' slow
Time is money and I got to go
Grab the bags, head for the door
Backin' out, clutchin' the dog
We heard sirens, dashed to the ride
And cop we see, open fire
Cop car, swung around the block
My man Rock, opened up the shots
My homey Lace, real nutty case
Said let's get it on, fuck a chase
Women screamin', grabbin' they kids
My homey Lace, flashin' the shit
Laughin' and shit, homey is sick
Look at Sharod, said let's go
Four desperado's, holdin' the dough
Make a left, yo, make a right
Head straight, though, watch those lights
We're in the hideout, laughin' it up

None of That,The Exorcist,2009,"(Intro) Sample
In large U.S. cities
Millions of people live a life of poverty in old rundown apartment dwellings
The poor tenants trapped in these buildings
Must put up with constant harassment by greedy landlords
Who want to throw them out for higher rents
These rich slum lords go to ruthless extremes to evict poor tenants
And nothing seems to stop them
When you can't afford to move
Even a rat infested tenement can be called home

But when landlords turn off your heat, water, gas, and electricity
To force you to move out
There's only one thing to do, fight!
This is the story of such a struggle

What if he sold a million records, will he sell out?
Then the whole world will respect him
Does he have doubts?
What if he really never exists?
What made 'em write that shit?
On everybody's top five
Why he ain't add to that list?
I wish the whole could hear him
Cuz he has the serum
For the Hip-Hop body been infected wit venom
Why do a lotta rappers bite off him?
And say they were the first?
When you ask Priest about it, he always just smirks
What about the Heavy Mental verse?
Why he so mysterious?
He laughs on the outside but his mind is serious
I can tell he knows more then he shows
Street clothes, but his brain is a UFO
Have you eva had a conversation wit 'em?
It's like listenin' to the instruction to a satellite space system
Does he talk about racism or atheism?
Or do he just hate religion
He's fly, then he looks like a bum then he's fly again
Wonder what's his outcome?
Well, soon all y'all will know
And y'all be lucky if you touch me
Science, Astrologists will discuss me
And I'm only at hexagram .03
And when I reach the Aquarian 9, the seven stars will align
The six planets will combine and I will incline
Wait till you see the lion covered in lamb
Then y'all see my presence for I Am
(Hook)
And I don't need none of that
Cars, jewelry, clothes, girls, money
No'I'mean, I don't need none of that
Mansion, a yard, a food, a job, sex
I don't need none of that
Just rap, no'I'mean, just rap for me
Cuz I don't need none of that

They say he's just a family man but he's always lookin' up
I saw him six in the mornin' just stuck
Starrin' up in the space
Other times he's quiet, normal calm face
He likes to eat a lot, entree
I saw him at the mall wit his sons
I saw him at the movies havin' fun
They say he stands on the roof starrin' at the sun
For hours, all rappers he devour
Every year for Buddha's birthday he plants lotus flowers
He talks to the trees but he don't smoke weed
He comes around after a long time, just leaves
A beast on the mic, he teach about Christ
He broke up wit the Israelites
He don't hang wit the Muslims, bounced outta Brooklyn
But he speak Hebrew, he goes to the Mosque
He raps BK, calls himself God
How many times he have to prove he's the nicest?
How many times he said the word ""Pharaoh""?
How many times he had to write shit like this?
Here's y'all answer, as long as I have a voice
Y'all will see ya voyage
Either if I'm livin' or transcendin'
My legend in y'all brains already been handwritten by God

Gate Way,The Exorcist,2009,"There's a season for everything
A time for every occupation of the heaven
A time for givin' birth
A time for dyin'
A time for for plannin'
A time for uprooted that which was planted
A time for killin'
A time for healin'
A time for knockin' down
A time for buildin'
A time for tears
A time for laughter
A time for mournin'
A time for dancin'
A time for throwin' stones away

So what does a man gain for the efforts that he makes?
I contemplate the task
'The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away'
Thy horse is a spirit waitin' me near they graves
A ghost rider leaps out on the saddle of it
Then the horse begins runnin'
Upward beyond an orange summit
That same horse saddled in my cousin and billions of dozens
Before their bones begin crumblin'
To their grave from the mother's stomach
Well, my nephew he wrote one
To that bowl sun, his mother followed him
Way up into the outer realms
Where the clouds are crowded wit men
At night the goons are prowlin' for gems
There's place for grandparents
A far advanced planet
Where dreams go, where Kings and Queens souls
Where everything seems slow
2Pac moves in that dark, Biggie is seein' at our city
It's misty; Jam Master Jay is in that haze
Big L as well, he dwells wit Big Pun in that Kingdom
And J. Dillinger and the millions of souls
Many more will have to go, reason why? I don't know
You try to stay focus, watchin' for that day approaches
You got the coverage of the Lord's judgment
The blood rinse off your soft body
Then placed in the arms of your mommy
She placed you in a potty
Fast forward, you in a staircase in your lobby
Watchin' fiends goin' out on apartment 5-D
Well I know this crackhead name Brother Lord
Always watchin' him huggin' the floor
Many get high and many souls have to fly
The Bible says we all have to die
You look for reasons, I don't know why
This is where the ghetto spirits carve tonight
No owls in flight, no sound in sight
As we float like a cloud thru the dark light
Barkin' of buncha old worn out dogs nobody wants
Hounds from hell, the starvin' night haunts
The flesh is unveiled, pure spirit unbothered by gravity
A body weight to a Godly place
Then drift into the internal night
As they take the eternal flight
They see your majesty, the Gatekeeper
The great weepers, the grave's deeper
And the night is frostbit
So long back to the darkness
That's enough, your majesty, that's enough
Shhhhh... You're sworn into secrecy, say no more
But Father...
No one must know about the hidden door
Close the door and move out the way
Close the door",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-gate-way-lyrics
Trapped,Elizabeth,2009.0,"To laugh, to cry, to have lived once and have died
A thousand times inside of gallons of wine
To have rose from the dead with a rose on ya head
With dirt you smirk, wiping off ya shirt
To fallen asleep to warring under sheets
To having lifemares with real people trying holding you beneath
It's right here, To you needing the Priest
Preacher pastor or prophet or pistol
Prayer words catapult above the candle light
As the stem fizzles above the sharing wombs
They sharing rooms to separated when they were in the tombs
Do the Stars talk to each other above us?
Or are they just exploding? We need a God to hug us
The paranormal, Psychic Evaluation
Small alphabets on the valiums I'm taking
Lost souls run to that black mountain escaping
The Dark Lord Sith on the spitten rhymes
To the world could adapt, I feel trapped, I feel trapped...

The flesh shell can excel
Only inhale and exhale to death impales
The zombie of darkness losing conscience - Tunnel vision
He's lungs slow, he listens to angels your body angled and stiffened
Shell hatched, cosmic seed is risen to Godly prison
Don't get it right we back to the feeble position
Then is the fetus submission, thugs & Christians
From baldheaded and wet to spanking to a blanked
To a name it, to train it, to game it, to sustain it
To anguish the famous the nameless
To water drawing up to raining
It's the figure eight till we get it straight
The S shape to connect to the opposite way
The number 8 double ciphers
What's troubling the writer?
Fears Illusion, prepared you in confusion
What's my conclusion or what's the solution?
Real music! Take the heartbeat and loop it!
Autotune all the moons put the pro-tools
Put the mic to the sun, sing vocals

The Killah,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"(Intro)
Watch this guy, he's killed a lot of rappers
You just gotta check his motives, his styles
I want everything on this dude

A cool guy, quiet low key but still blow heat
Don't smoke but knows how to roll trees
A ladies man, 'two-step' his favorite dance
Expensive restaurants, kid's a vaunt, lives by himself
Owns rare paintings of the Renaissance - in different art
Likes classical music, assassins movement
His cash is fluid, Froogle, type his name in Google
Wikipedia, Encyclopedia, YouTube media
They got his name but no birth date
He kills rappers in the worst way
He snatches their brains from his skulls
Slam it to the floor to see what they would think
Or if they're thinkin' anymore
He rhymes from the back of the crowd
He neva acts wild, the Don profile dig his style
He catches them after the stage then puts them on display
He's often calm, predictive, crazy
Talks to 'em while he cuttin' of their arms
(Hook)
He's the Killah *on repeat*

Murder is the color of death
The artist's the Killah
He leaves ink in a mess
The Mic is a weapon wheneva threatened
He brings on Armageddon, he shows regression
You seem 'em keep steppin'
He's in and out in different cars - a psycho
Have used the body of his victim at the morgue
He speaks other languages; he talks to Angels from cliffs
He sowed, usually blocks the sun when he sits
He once broke a rapper in half
Then put 'em back together all bad
Another emcee thought he was nice
He didn't know he was battlin' for his life
When this rapper strike, he neva hits the same spot twice
This is his hype, this is his weight
This is his duplicate of his rhyme book
We took from our safe
These are his words; see how they're written like daggers
This is a sample of his page DNA
One spit it could split matter
We got leads to his next hit
This map points to where he would go...

Death Physical,The Exorcist,2009,"Will we all sell drugs forever?
Life endeavors, the pipe's the pleasure
Fight the pressure, tides just severed
Crack is measured, go broke then y'all back together
Jail or gettin' clapped, we all are trapped, however
How many gangsta spirits you have to deal wit in dreams
Wake up in screams till you finally feel it
Never realizin', neva feelin' vibes in
But still survivin'
Till around the corner they peel the iron
Eyes them, flashback when you clap gats
That was a payback, bad karma
You shoulda had ya armor, grab the llama
Light the ganja, spirit conjures
When the body goes back to the Earth
The soul goes back to the Universe
Names on plaque in tombs and the dirt
Fact is we all consumed by the work
A young soldier told me the streets is glory
Died before me
(Hook) 2x
On death birthday
Blowin' candles, wooden handles
Damn, he went in the worst way
Death birthday
His presence is no presents
Draw your weapon for protection
We all wear black on death birthday

What's love a bullet wit ya best friends blood?
You see your little sister's kid
Give 'em a pack of the drugs
What's real, you see ya man consultin' the deal
You really jealous but neva really express how you feel
What's heart, you see ya man gettin' killed in the park
You both get shot at, but you disappear in the dark
What's life, it's somethin' we all go thru
From the old school
I know them rules, I know them jewels
Niggas play cool but get you punked
Next thing they get you drunked
Next thing you know you in the alley slumped
And niggas ask you to burn
Turn around and pass you some sherm
You neva learned till that casket discerned
Your best friend haven't been dead for an hour
And you at his baby-mom house wit some flowers
Rubbin' her back, tellin' her she need to relax
How foul is that? Fingertips on her back

Edge of the Night,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"From the edge of the night we fly so high
Within the misty skies, good bye
Seein' flights of devils, flights of angels
We over the ghetto, full moon is yellow
We see this strange dude, walk, we off the roof
We sought to a stoop to a door
We locked and disappeared in the foggy air
Only to reappear, next year, to the same spot
Off the rooftop, we flappin' away-away-away
Outta the hood, far over to the woods
We land, to take a drink, I'm thirsty, unworthy
Near the moonlit, streams, in the night demon
It's like a dream, and in the seas we sip
We gon', we swift, we too swift
Up and up, I feel it in my gut
Get ready to come wit me
The lost souls come see
Beyond a lake, beyond the mountain
On a branch in the black tree
We quiver, and chill out tonight
But nothin' stops us in flight
So in pass a million years
To a thousand in the hemisphere
Pass the hypersphere

Rip off the clouds in the atmosphere
Disappear into the thin air
Yo I'm only seen by human eyes
I'm teleportin', drift to the sky
Mystique moon rise, I zoom by
See the constellations up in close
Spirit's formed, rugged ghost, the satellite
View on my body, while gon' up in smoke
When the sun broke, I awoke
And realized I musta drifted far
Shit I'm close to Mars on this glowin' star
I jumped off, made my way down to the planets' turf
There's more sand and dirt
It's different then the planet Earth
No signs of life forms, just keep the mic warm
The sun is further
I need more then soul or power to keep the lights on
Coldest shit, wind current carries me across a desolate land
So treacherous, bankers won't invest in it
It's pestilence, like the dust turnin' to rust
I wonder what's beneath the Mar's crust?
People like us, lost colonies
Who rarely couldn't keep a strong economy
Use to study planet Earth and talk about astronomy
Maybe we are them; maybe they left Mars in rocket ships
And landed on Earth to beat apocalypse
I started all over in a new world, a new planet
Made the journey for survival, yo, but who planned it?",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-edge-of-the-night-lyrics
I Am King,The Untold Story of Walter Reed Part Two,UnKnown,"We do this for sport
Yeah

The vocal words from the prince from Persia
Silent weapons for quiet wars, expensive murder
Savage , snakes, half man half ape
The migration of the black space, fat lake
The  his own fate
Reflection eclipse on lunar
The medicine man with boxwood should have came sooner
Heavy breathing, the fox feeds on tuna
The pusher's drug, the moon lit his blood under a tree
The warrior priest bush ran spear pinpoints the deer
The armor shows his drama, the blood shows his honor
His mug show the horror, his tongue show the herb of garlic
Milk weed and seeds above the starlit
Below the prophet, the stone breeds the warrior
Golly his body submerged in garment

Who am I King? Who am I Lord?
What was I a peasant? What was I a boy?
What I do pray pull me out the grave
During my journey back this is what I'll say

My kingdom of glory, rose as scrolls of stories
Behold 8 million eyes before me
The test of resurrection, my steps to edge of perfection
I leap into the force of winds to sounds of organs
Harps are flying dormant since God's angels are calling
Whirlwind from the orbit
Infinity runs down the vacuum wings, they crown me Black King
The hands of time push me forward
My face frosted 'til I forewarned them of the warlord
All embrace all, the sword take off limbs
Leaping through rims, the space horse
Great thoughts, if my name died, then rap is back
The psychic on a prophet, I write it, you watch it
Under clouds are dark rings strumming harp strings
I ask this question, who am I?

Who am I King? Who am I Lord?
What was I a peasant? What was I a boy?
What I do pray pull me out the grave

Things We Share (Original),Best of Killah Priest & A Prelude to the Offering,2008,"I burped upon my mothers skirt, threw up it church
Lift my little head, looked around the room, that alert
At first I seen two ladies who reminded me of a nurse
The first creatures I seen while coming to this Earth
In search, my mind still seeking
I seen this little lady life her little arms, shouting glory while she reading
Curiosity, I start reaching for her book
My mommy took my little head, laid me on her shoulders and shook
Almost went to sleep but no not this time
A lot on this young toddlers mind
Dreams of kings, and graveyards and thrones and dollar signs
No one interpret but I guess this day was my purpose
I lift my head again and start searching

My ancestors brought from Africa on the slave ships
Now return in the air with first class trips
Passenger six, window seat, relax and viewing the fish
The trees, the seas are blue like the jewels on my fist
From the islands of Costa Rica we share the same life
Children play with marbles of gold, return the plight
We share the same life, we share that same life

I heard his voice in the side of my ears, mad raspy but clear
So I start to turn around real slow, y`all know
I`m shaking and stuff, that baby thing about to fall
You might laugh but I`m two inches tall
Finally, I see this black man in a black robe
His hair all white, turning pages, saying lets read Job
And above him this white image on a cross
Then suddenly, a light enters my thoughts
Indian Gods look like them, Chinese Buddha looks like them
Arab`s Muhammad look like them
I thinking why I`m in an all black church
But then Jesus have to have white skin
Like him, it`s kind of frightening
That`s why everybody else prosper `cause they won`t convert to me
Your own are supposed to always come first
Not only that but Moses was Pharaoh`s favourite
Made ruler over everything, lay with Egyptian maidens
And Pharaoh loved Moses like his own
Same lips, same nose, same skin tone
Even Hebrews hated Moses, they thought he was Egyptian
Put Ramzi and him together they couldn`t tell the difference
And learn this fact, history proved that
Ancient Egyptians were always and still is black
That makes Moses, Joseph, Jesus and David
The same colour as the tribe chained on the slave ships
Not only that but Moors ruled in Spain
For a thousand years they reigned, we complete that chain
We have black scholars like J. Rogers
While the devil government praise their dollar
I pray for the day they holler",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-things-we-share-original-lyrics

Here I am deep in my soul
Here I am walkin on the sand
Talkin to a man in a language that neither he or I understands
Felt painless, though I'm anxious to ask him what his name is
His clothes looked the ancient and his face was ageless
His hand were sacred as if travelled through places
And I was an Atheist until I was greeted by the warm embraces of the local natives
Now I'm in the middle of an oasis singin praises to a gigantic spaceship
Walkin in the middle of a desert, I felt pleasant
While Kings and Queens and men with wings stand in my presence
In their pure essence, now take me to where my ancestors are restin
They begin to take me by my hands and walked on the sands
To the deep wilderness behind the villages
I looked up; we went to a mystic spot
He said, ""Here it is, there's the pyramids where your spirit lives""
I walked inside, seen myself as King Tut, layin in a green tux
Wings came out in dusk
I saw mummies moon walking out of their coffins
Then a voice said, ""Well done""
Then they greeted me in welcome
The Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Which word best describes this urge?
I refer to a proverb, observe the third optic nerve
It moves clockwork, times stopped but I'm not disturbed
Nothin that you can smell, touch, taste, or even be heard (heard)

Don’t Stop,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"It's amazin' how I just won't stop
The heathens come wit their plots
Mixtapes I drop, then another one
I give it away for free cuz it comes from me
Fuck it, we got more in stock
As space expands, heaven and hell expands
The more souls, the more it grows
I created my plan, I'ma kill the devil Friday evenin'
Come back wit all his horns for souvenirs
Murder all his demons, his followers prepare for war
I'm comin' wit this word, bullets and more
The game don't wanna recognize me no more
Fine, I'll pull a pluck from the wall
Puffy and those niggas gettin' paid off
I tried being humble, but now I'm gon' AWOL
These stars are controlled by a dark force
They hate the light of Christ
That's why I'm not in the page of the Source
Wassup Nas? Join the team, fight against the evil regime
His soul seems torn; don't know who to put on
Well come wit us, and join wit the side of the Elohim
Wassup Ghost? I hear your soul
I know you wanna put your hands around the devil's throat
Two year plan, I'll bring back the Son of Man
Fuck the devil and his team, blum-blum-blam
Where those brothers on the blocks, Google up God
It's God radio, so what's the ratio?
Squeak wide spectrum, sisters I need more then ever

Its Run DMC touger then ever
I got more then one mac on me tucked under the leather
Hold your head, don't play into the media
Tabloids said they don't want your media
Fuck the skinny bitch, I want y'all thick
Unless y'all skinny wit brains then who give a fuck anyways
Radio was my crown of thorns, I ain't proud to put on
Turn the volume all the way up, still didn't sound too strong
Pink hero rappers, won't be around that long
You just a clown for the storm
Fizzles break on the skull of crystal
Bite down to the grizzle, may I continue
Mourn to menu my mind grows like the electric shell or the UFO
It keeps expandin', like the hole is warmin' up the globe
God's house has a million stairs, twelve attics
And one of them you'll find me writin' in there
Walk out the front to the Garden of Eden
Niggas is starvin' or eatin'
It's time to start robbin' and squeezin'
Give Priest a couple of seconds
I rebuild heaven on records
Check it, blow weapons at the face of the old presses
Pass us the glass, seen by the eyes of the mass
It took me seven days to create each line
Took me seven hours to rehearse this rhyme
Just seven minutes till we design
Seven seconds to reach ya minds
DMX in jail, holla at me dawg
Thru it all I see who you are
Real niggas do real things
Fake niggas don't want people to see
They hide, fuck it, be who you was born to be
Why lie? Everybody wanna seem like they innocent
You switch sides, nigga live wit it
Real niggas be like this is what I did
This is who I am, this is how I live
My pockets seem small but my heart and my soul feel big
My heart and my soul feel big",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-dont-stop-lyrics
When I Speak,The 3 Day Theory,2010.0,"In the streets where there's hustle and crime
Through the shorty stuffing his nine
Fiends scuffing for dimes or crack
We know that we packing the gat
When D's attack, we squeeze those MAC
Ease back, the G's stacks, and weed pack
We take a hit off the piff and reminisce
Ask a question how we exist
Dirt under my nail got a story to tell
See the struggle and the hustle through the smoke of my L
See the young lifers through my blunt fire
Vengeful shorty's loading up shells
The gun will light ya, bullets will bite ya
Come through the hood, we invite ya
Words from the streets, the most prolific writer
(Chorus)
When I speak, I know you hear the streets
I know you hear the part of me
I'm knee-deep in the concrete
On my where that block is
When I speak, you can see the part of me
It's so deep in the concrete
Hold tight when the Glocks squeeze
When I speak

My nigga twist, they use to say he couldn't wait until I snapped
Now when I speak, I snap like Christopher Reeves back
What I put in the rap, I'm entirely that
Rock like Ozzy Osborne biting the head off a bat
Shoot lead off a track, my old shit is plutonium, nigga
You could be dead off that
Young Don Corleone, get bucks with Ras
So just pull up ya skinny-jeans and tuck ya sack
I rep the West masterfully, fuck with that
Can't be done, cause ain't no one
Who could turn the streets black like it ain't no sun
Still on that Dogg Pound shit cause it ain't no fun
Less the homies get money too
That's why Ras Kass is Van Gogh
Da Vinci is cousin Blu
He be MF, I stayed low key like the price of coke in Dade County
The Ballerstatus found me

Numbers,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"The Tetragrammaton squeeze come beneath camera lens
Ease some, police come, place cameras on men
Deceased ones lay stiff - posin' on cement roses
On their lids cold winds blow over the ditch
Where the laser pray of that snitch
Hollow tips go in clips, four in the whip
Peep around the block, thieves around the lots
Fiends around the spot, Ds around the clock
Midnight comes - here comes the shots
Eardrums are shot, the beer from a bum drops
Here come the track meat
Dude's runnin' like athletes
Chased by a black jeep, through the zigzag streets
The night looks like a million demon mass
A young girl tries screamin' from her plastic bags
Takes her last gasp, psycho killer fucks her in the ass
Body parts left by the trash
Psycho-evaluation, alley's and train stations
Lurkin' perverts with small hustlers who heard dirt
Let the herb search, a pimp mistreatment
Made his bird chirp, the police chrome heat blow your dome piece
Cars wit the phone seat, the tales from the lone Priest

God bonds the prince of the heathens
While I rinse from demons, holy water glory aura
Around my crown of horror
You down today or you down tomorrow
I'm dreamin' fallin' asleep in Church tryna stay awake
Preacher keep readin' the same verse
The offer trays pass by
With more cash then I have on my thigh
The Pastor ducks somebody did a drive-by
Was it for me? The sky looks stormy
Or am I high? Leavin' the Church in the rain
An old lady came said she was sent to warn me
You're runnin' like Jonah
Just then my cell phone buzzed
I went to pick it up
She said: ""Try to stay sober""
Always alone and watch the cobras
I see somethin' on the 30th day of October
Then she came closer
I reach for my Bible like the gun on my holster
Thugs bargain wit God when they doin' life behind bars
Or in the yard full of scars
Why do women light two candles on the Sabbath?
The Law of Commandments
Born amongst the wage slander and a bandit
In the famine, shots ring
Witness ran, the faces vanish
Somethin' Satanic on another planet, it's all damaged

The soul of converts change their religions
In the streets wit dirty converse, dickies saggin'
The trick of the system - the dragon
The beast wit the seven heads, ten arms
The great whore of Babylon, psychobenzaprine
Ultram, Methadone, Desert Storm, but weapons drawn
The Good Shepherd wand
The sheep that the wolf will creep in wool sheets
Woool beats knock, MPC's, Priest rock
MVP - Most Vivid Poet, the last scripture's open
I'm spittin' omens, 6-6-6 St. Lutheran
Angel of Light, chief musician
Or tombstone tables I write
Apocalypse raps and the art department facts
And the science that could lift crafts
Ya'll ain't hear shit like this in awhile
Original style, lyrically wild
Aphyllous, I kill devilish wit the metal shit
God's gun tells Satan it's a stick-up
Drop the pitchfork, take the horns off
This bitch's soft, gimme back the souls
And all the freedom you stole
Take back all the slum evil you sold
Read 'em in scowls, these are the scrolls
Now let 'em be told",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-numbers-lyrics

Stick my middle finger in the socket
Shock shit, spit in your space and hack, spit
Flow melodic, droppin coals, gettin dough from out your pockets
Dancin topless, look exotic, movin erotic
Who's in the projects with my acomplice?
Kickin ebonics, bow while we accomplish
While you standin there lookin astonished
I'm on some calm shit, you wanna buy the smoke?
Masada be the bomb shit, with my chron spit
Leave you aerostotles armless, yolk you up like an omelette
Hit you with my Shaolin palm fist
And girls love it when I plam they tits

Ladies in the spot, lookin hot (I'm wit that)
Niggas gettin dough 'round the clock (I'm wit that)
Party's off the meat rack, what's the feedback? (Yo, you wit that?)
Yea I'm wit that

Hit the bar, chicks puttin more in they bra
Goin bizarre, rollin in cars
Throw it up par, IV's glow in the dark
Inside these damn near tore 'em apart
Push your Lexus, drivin reckless

Tonite We Ride, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Verse I
My peeps creep up in black jeeps
Black motorcycles, Harley Davids jackets
Tattered dragons, Skull disciples
The one eye of the great seal on our shoulders
Street soldiers. Heat holders
Any tension will make you lean over
Niggers hate flinching and sudden movements
We get to shootin’
Gangster music
Killers with pool sticks, so much cake
We drive around in the cool whip
My mind state is William Crowdy
Killers around me. My vision gets cloudy
Now we on thrones, wizard douse me
Chosen water
Stone pillars, porcelain alters
Come talk to Walter
Fine women all draped in line
All my niggas got crowns on ‘em
This y’all warning, my destiny is calling
(Hook)
Come. tonight we ride, pray we don’t die
Tonight we fly. Ride, fly, pray we don’t die
Verse II
They call me the great terrible king
My back leans. My hands joined with the palms of my queen
Vision fades. we still on the block AKs and crack
The usual daps and holla backs
This brick and martyr rap . . 
I bring flowers for you cats
It’s funeral day
For you and your corny DJ, now replay
I’m up in Amsterdam coffee shops puffing hash
You at the club in the circle spankin’ your own ass
This is stained glass, chrome blast. Now, walk the angels’ path
I laugh and dump my ash. Another toe tag, body bag
You pussy-clot
Trying to test the God
The rest of y’all wear panties and bras
I see a little fanny from your squad
No homo that’s for me and Biggie
He’s gone, now I run the city no P. Diddy
No making of the band
Just me breaking your hand
Crushing like soda cans
Conan, throwin’ lightning bolts at your fam
My fifth shoots fireballs
Why you all tryin’ to front
You know we fry you all up at once
(Hook)
Come. tonight we ride, pray we don’t die
Tonight we fly. Ride, fly, pray we don’t die
Fly, fly, pray we don’t die
(Closing by George Clinton)
Blow us up, they have set to blow us up
Blow us up, with no regret they blow us up
Blow us up, you want to bet they blow us up
Ask ‘em what we did and when we did it

Lock us up, with no regret they lock us up

The Destroyer,The 3 Day Theory,2010,"Uhh, he a fighter
If he's an arm reach of me, he's hit
He's cut, he's bleeding, his face is fucked up
His skin fake, his brains are shook up
Brains are shook, brains are shook up

I was hearing spiritual fall, 'fore you saw me in flesh
Clicking my fingers on the saw, I smoke a garden of cess
Watching the serpents and they going through the cracks of projects
When cops arrest, lay the scanners, paperwork is processed
A bank robbery occured and like you, the hostage
Heart bracket, thought you was fly like a latin puppet
Punk ass, you walk every square inch from light to darkness
Through the carnage, yeah, I'm torn a piece, the flow is haunted
I paint this blood, I'm dirty like the rings in the tub
Spit his thug, hit his thug, get him touched with a duck
Son shining, that's my son, how I sell my sun
Steven King, the throne holder, there's alot on the come
The slur of the guns, the funds, victory and success
The wisdom won the west, will do the size you with time's nest
I heard Farrakhan sick, I'mma kill me some strength
The truth told, time and flow, had to flow flourescent, one

We go to war, let's stay alive in these streets
The spitting will come to vision, when we collide with these beats
We go to war, the five man brigade
Holding live hand grenades and real live anime
We at war, will see us crowd in the trench
Mercenary gorillas, stepping out the myst
We at war right now, faggot, give up and run
Stans can't understand where this nigga, pick up your gun

Uh-oh, hands up, still dropping that shit
Custom block on my hip, bitches love to gossip
It's time to pop clicks, my friend, kid spits
Shift to them, yeah, I got them shits again
Diarrhea on glow, tired to see ya on the flow
Ya'll niggas pizza, I eat you on the go
Seeza, Son glow bright, like sunshine
One rhyme, make niggas pack up the punchline
Still slammin' shit to break your spine
Paralegals, paramedics, come, you paralyzed
You'se a chump in the deck, we ain't playing with those
You can catch me on air live, saying you rap hoes
I do all the falls, I'mma true hip hop it
Think See' slipped up, get your shit popped quick
I bust two, don't make me crush you
You're minimal, feel me, I muddy youse, you tentacle


Priest a blood gut, I stop from no one to shogun
I blow guns, a thousand slug be fronting
Rappers I make 'em, til angels grab 'em and drag 'em
To them pearly gates of the firely lakes, I time with snakes
To make my early escape, through brick walls, beneath the shape of a monster
With six claws, hundred feet tall with thick jaws
Battle me, man? I had the anatomy, I'm from the Killah Academy
Priest, I spit the end of days til your feminine ways
Endless is graves, with tombstones
My body's broken down, like a fine tooth cold
Rappers get scattered, across deserts where scavengers gather
Bones were shattered and bloods get splattered
I'm above you actors, I'm a director
For you direct whores, the mic raptor
I bite your muthafucking head off


I put and end to everything, you earn to represent
If you learn to get the message, you burn, then check the method
Iron lift, scientist, plus the pride of a sick force
Pitchforks, dripping with the light of a lit torch
Stiff poor stick in a game of wet noodles
Do they videos with dobermans, at home with pet poodles
People of the click, kick ballistics with the fifth
I wish Pocahontas would of killed John Smith
Stand firm damaging, trampeling on your chance
Pour a castle in the sand, I'm branded by the hand of God
And I'mma man up, his laws, not yours
Rock raw, I'm leaving challengers and name it on all fours
Ever see my buddhas, through the flesh, my nigga
Quickest way to any heart, through the chest, my nigga

Losing everything, you could collect, trying the ghetto rap",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-destroyer-lyrics

Damage me, how can this be?
Bronchitis, the itis and sinus, take out the tongue
Rubber gloves are the nicest supplier for the writer
Arthritis bones break easily
Too much toxins, I need antioxidants
I spit Grammys out my oxygen
My only family - the hood doctrine
When I was just an infant, the streets grabbed me
Reached through the semen cavities
Took my pacifier out and put the concrete in my teeth
Breast fed me, grey goose, celeb G
Y'all ain't ready
They took me out the crib with numbers across my bib
Moms lost her wig, when jail is just an auction
Depending on the numbers of ya bid
Niggas running under the bridge
Train station, the A train, triple six
Do you blame Satan or God?
Would you sleep in ya bed or a morgue?

Be careful who you follow
Be careful on what you swallow
In hell's frail, pass the L
Keep ya eyes on the bottle
'Cause if I die, those niggas die
It's all thought out in the third eye
Feel me?

We follow drug dealers as Jesus
Look at the prophet like a Caesar
Dresses miracle, preferable leaders
Or a gun handlers, number of the Beast is branding us
Mind damage, slumped posture under the cameras
Cracked cardiovascular, Dracula passed the massacre
The passages aborting reality planes
So foul allow me to explain, young child in the chains
Society now has changed
Groupies, kufi's, gauge and graves, toolies
Bad movies get paid on the roof with the Uzi, popping shit
A mouth with the loose leaf empty clips
Enemies get hit, fly shit

A gangsta glory, bed full of Benjamins, having orgies
Sneak boxes off the floor at least four feet
Jury basements, a brewery, cases of champagne
Painting's costly, maidens
Other bosses talking in foreign languages
40 acres testing aiming
Flossing and dressing walking with ya boys out ya arraignment
Priest glory, UFO boarding
Able to foresee the Moorish King
Strange dudes talk to angels
Beam up great wings
Brush against the thick walls of the other planets
Writing rhymes, they lighting kinds of men
Species and women, my streets never made me creepy
Goosebumps - only if you front
Street Gods and gangster devils

In this drug trade benevolence is ki
King - drops the medicines
No evidence from D's, everything else is capable
Unless it's inescapable
Bad days, we'll make it thru
Never hesitate, the street will resonate
The guns will detonate
The fake and the snake
The hood will legislate
The letters to the states

Ramen noodle platoons
Half gorilla, half baboon
Tattoos paint the skin
The hood sanctioning

Anti or pro?
Which way we go?
The question or the answer?
Shit is serious as cancer
I'm just telling you, yo

Digital thugs in hieroglyphical slugs in the pictures we love
The internet respect or blood, download, pounds of dro
Compact gats and rounds of blow
Recorder of the slaughter bullets hold the footage
D's scan the faces in their booklets
Before they start booking
Child outlet, was Malcolm X house arrest?
Now his heart beats outside of his chest

Behind The Stained Glass,Best of Killah Priest & A Prelude to the Offering,2008,"?Behind the Stained Glass?
You see the album cover
Look behind the picture
There?s something behind the picture
The stained glass

Let?s go beyond the spectrum of light
To a thought, to a line, to my breath on the mic
That?s the cost of the rhyme, I start from the left then I write
Holding the pen by its abdomen
Then started imagining myself through galaxies that I haven?t been
With my index I begin to message my pen?s breast
Performing poetical intercourse ?til the end get wet
It climax when I rap, ejaculating ink when I think
Masturbating to its brink
Then inside my brain is the Big Bang
This is more than just a sixteen, it?s a sick dream
Exploding hypernova, so I write it over and over
The righteous soldier with an Israelite culture
I established the tablets of madness with graphics for savage
Leaving fragments of bo?es, deadly poems, spread havoc

?Behind The Stained Glass?
Oh look ?Behind the Stained Glass?
Behind The Stained Glass
Don?t even search, look ?Behind the Stained Glass?
The curse will come

As I light up from the inside like an exquisite Asian paper lantern
This is lyrics invading, drawing in the greatest patterns
Started through the thermosphere, burning through the air
Down through the atmosphere, through the mesosphere
Broke through the layer, through the troposphere
Past the stratosphere, I?m a giant magnet for ideas
And it rotate light-years, passing through the ozone
Squeeze into the crack of dawn
Then a rap is formed inside my brain, then it storms, rains long
?Til it fill up my pages with stained icons
?Til the mic warms, don?t turn those lights on
Keep them off when I talk
Distant galaxies will rush away from you
Then you sway into a view
Like a thermonuclear flash bulb
Then you see my face splashed with blood
Now when I turn on the lights it looks like a massacre
It?s all over the grass and my gloves

?Behind the Stained Glass?
Don?t look ?Behind the Stained Glass?
Don?t even search ?Behind the Stained Glass

The dark grey tunnels of my conscious is complex
It?s conscious with grave concepts
In a black cave that echoes songs for the ghetto as I engrave my context
Thoughts begin to compress, so I have to breathe with a calm breath
It?s like I?m taking a long rest and it?s beyond stress
?Cause before I pick up my pen my palm sweat
Everything in the song now connects
So come along on a conquest
My mind is outrageous, paragraphs and phrases
Super compounds, nouns, words is written inside the pages
To me the margin is just holograms
When you write like King Solomon
Everything seen through a scholar lens
Take you to the outer realms
No oxygen, just watched a film
Whether it?s drawn in Sanskrit or even handwrit?
Or even painted on the canvas, as long as you can understand it
__ places out of tablets, books or handed in a pamphlet
Or information from encyclopaedias
Now we write graffiti ?cause we were pyramid architects
That is some mysterious art I kept
Mega irregular comparatives, superalitives, adjectives, adverbs
Bad nerves, do not disturb once the wrist swerves
It reads this word, Priest, the Da Vinci of this century

?Behind the Stained Glass?
Don?t look ?Behind the Stained Glass?
Don?t even search ?Behind the Stained Glass
Don?t even look ?Behind the Stained Glass
My real attribute can only be heard when a astro shoot
My thought crawls
?Behind the Stained Glass?
Up through a narrow cone that comes out of my dome
Just like a pharaoh sitting on a throne

Pull another out in Beirut
Damn, hangman with daggers in his hand

The seven spirits of the virgin emerging
In my right hand
Fly crawls up her eye, she spoke
My head low, replied: ""Why?""
She said: ""Eat bread"" jumps out the spiritual dumps
Holding a ultra-gun
I triumph, my life slump
So y'all niggas better beware this year, prepare
For the uprising, this is my assignment

Eagles and black wishes, Black Christmas
A Santa with the hammer, L's, loading clips and shells
Thunder *, bodies hanging from the antlers
Call the ambulance, cuz, transplant thugs
I emerge
From the verge
Bullshit
Sever the life cord, the axe of the reaper
Y'all hate nature, well, welcome to the urn of the cremator
Court's adjourned, attend to the king later
Stars alignin' when I'm rhyming
Welcome to Orion and to my second assignment

The murder angel wants you
Black dogs want food, black fog myst in front of the moon
Hawks grunt, * did you throw up your lunch
Light-headed, at the sight of your windpipe shredded
Your wife beheaded, your pets put in pots
Cooking pot, a Brooklyn plot
Is a cushion for ox
Been stabbed in the back more times
Write witches kisses
I'm working with, blood vacuum through the room
I write this doom priceless tomb above his head

To the galaxy as we know
I'm back, Killah Priest
Yo

The big world
Big dreams, big scenes
New ideas let's take it to the extremes
New way of life new way to write
New age of thinkers
Believe what I say (breath) on the mic
I'm still strivin', I'm still thrivin', I start drivin'
Park the car, stare up at the horizon
I can see far past the orion
Venus and mars, suddenly i see the stars alignin'
I start climbin', outta body experience
Pass the warmer climates, never stop for perseverance
I'm back more stronger than my first appearance
Like Moses from the mountain or the pilgrimage of Malcolm
I came back from the dungeons with a new album
Found life, so many ideas for viewers to like
I called it Black August, cause it's the month I was born
I painted a rap portrait, told you it's more than a song
Told you it's more than just poetry and words in a song
I'm telekinetic, connect with the other side like John Edwards
Standing by myself staring at the dawn
Woke up outta this trance from a car that honked its horn
(Chorus 2x)
Yo, On the highway speedin', windows down I'm weavin'
On each side of the rode, I'm out of control
Sparks fly from the side cause I'm skiddin' the rails
Leavin' all my words behind for prison in hell
No more being strapped, police giving me mail
While ya'll having fun and I'm sittin' in jail
Nah, I've dried my tears for the last five years
Ya'll been usin' me, stealin' my ideas
Then lied to the world like ya'll pioneers
But when a young lion's feared
Whatcha'll do? Ya'll take and put it in a cage

Toss popcorn at me, No, I'm not happy

Ya'll know when I hunt I leave a corpse

But I prove the unordinary, stood the test of time, My
Flesh, my mind, my spirit arose in the lyrics
Was hidden inside of the soul to reveal it
Every emotion is an emotion of my pen
Words of the gem it shines in the minds of men
For those that don't receive light, it blinded them
So when they do, push rewind again
Over and over till they feel me getting closer
Till I'm more than just a picture on a poster
Till finally break down on they sofa
Then they show love, the room's gettin' colder
Then they feel the presence, I give em' the message
My words make the hair stand on their arm
Embrace my psalms, like a child embrace his moms'
So sing along, and feel it forever

Puff a Cloud,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"My man rolled up a path of souls
Said he packed wit gold
Lit it up, took a puff his eyes has closed
Coughed in his speech, said the endorphins has released
Off into peace, a cool speech like the spirit reached outta his chest
As the weed ascend chased away in happiness
I smiled; I lift my drink off destruction
Fiery sea, rushin' down to my stomach
But it filled in wit spirits and mellow instructions
Knowin' water's released, selfish mystique
As he chief's, reachin' thru the cloud, passin' to me
Exchange for a drink, we took a moment to think
Damn, look at the world thru our eyes chink
Our black suits coulda been white
Watchin' our man cut the wedding cake, him and his wife
Flyin' ribbons; fly women throwin' rice
But the cold night at the grave sight
Droppin' flowers from his creation to the day he lost his power
Then we both just there stuck, thinkin' to ourselves
Damn another high Priest smoke cloud, he stands up
Daddy said he's thru wit the needles
Said he's thru usin' his peoples
Said he's finished beatin' his wife
The preacher told 'em ""Yo you're cheatin' ya life""
Meanwhile I write, lady sings the blues
Child on the six o'clock news
Face twisted and confused
Old man liftin' his booze
A lil girl rubbin' her bruise
The destruction of the angels
Streets bargain wit God, who's gon' save you?
Turn to this bars, y'all need a Savior
Not a mirror between bars to look at ya neighbor
Jail time is hard, razor scars
Traitors in yards, gangstaz and Gods
Shit is all odd, no'I'mean?
The ascend of a good brother, the down fall of another
Who's to suffer but the mothers?
A fiend said she seen the dragon in a crack pipe
She said it breathed fire at her
She quit smokin' that night
But the dragon morphed into her man
Took her by her hand
Let her by the dealer she copped the bag
Told her no one gave a damn
She lit it, then his face bust open like stitches
She jumped outta the window, sixth floor
Amongst the dice and the liquor
Shit, damn, what we gon' do?",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-puff-a-cloud-lyrics
Street Matrix,Elizabeth,2009,"In the galaxy there's a cube, the cube is the net
The net is the streets where killers log on to connect
Neurotransmitters dealers' recept
Looking for a transplant niggas for the body to reject
Thru the street deep, neurons, niggas form like cells
Holding heat, molecules that'll buss off at least shells
A round of ground of ya domes town, chrome four pound
And park in lake areas, hunters release the hounds
Here's where the peptide feeds on they own proteins
Single iron will blow ion
Niggas contaminate the bloodstream
Arteries clog ya lobbies, receptors not enough oxygen
Red cells camouflage with shotty's
Peptides are synthesized in the neutrons soma
Caused the block to go into a coma
Synaptics die, rush, switch the chemicals after the weed aroma
Removal of the blocks, brains mechanism, may affect the system
Get out of line, flatline when the tec will hit 'em
Respect the wisdom or its death in prison

Attack the killers, follow white rabbit dealers
Downholes Merovingian ho's, holding ratchet triggers
Underground railroads like modern Harriet pictures

Ecstasy bitches walking in the streets
Coffins beneath, opiates, OG kids
But nothing in New York is sweet
Jezebel show ya bitch with the bullets she caught with her teeth
Blocks are sedated, till the Glocks is waving
Cops are caving, shots are blazing
Like the Nazis invading, dude's beefing
Till the glucagon, PCP's start secretion
Than this bitch whispers a secret
The laws of attraction, war there's action
Capping, stabbing, the old lady telling the captain
While the analysts grafting, so take a trip thru the mind
And take a trip down the train line

Street Opera (Original),Black August: Revisited,UnKnown,"Struggles.. in the ghetto, going through hell to come out right
This is what we must go through to reach heaven
That's what we go through
This what we go through to reach heaven to escape hell

In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live
As the World Turns around negative through positive
At the edge of the nights, The Guiding Light

Children in the General Hospital

In my location is where they run the operation
You either stuck or getting bucked by the train station
Word is bond if beyond after dawn, they hit you up bad
And watch drop and they gone, they 9mm's
Make bitches scream high-pitch like a tweater
But shorty is a strong believer when he hold his heater
I use an ounce of my mind to make rhymes
And a half of my brain to cause rain
Cuz life is like a game with no instructions
Streets they be tusslin' to have a brother bustin'
They adolescence carry weapons in they section, a wrong direction
When they all pack protection, forgotten knowledge, is all symbolic
And heathenistic, they need statistics, for cops to search
They pop you first and dig your pockets later
And maybe catch you for money and your pager (gimme that)
Or slice your throat with the razor
An old man told me once, sitting on a chair rolling a blunt
""I had a son your age, that ended up on front page
From the impact of a 12 Gauge, his assassination
Drove me in a world of hatred, today it's hard to face it""
He showed me old flicks, he was up for a scholarship
But it ended by a hollow tip
Damn I never thought life could be so short
I still see him on the basketball court
Fought in my life, I shedded great tears
Tryin' to escape here, but for me it might take years
Walk towards these fears and I'm still here
He rolled back in his wheelchair
And said, ""The streets is vicious
And all the witches play you for your riches
They blow you kisses and show you stitches""
So then he pulled back his pictures

Blow gray smoke rose over the city potholes
Obituary to those we missed we buried
Or like gospel scriptures of each niggas
But there weren't saints
The bullet ink helps us paints those pictures
Mornin' grandmother
Brothers holdin' their mothers and faintin' sisters
The streets gather wit people
Than as time goes, small groups fade off
A day walk thru the cemetery, I could hear the grave talk
Couldn't cheat death, tho twice he bet
Not Eve to the trees, he kept switchin' the debt
Left-handed, under the dirt soon become under a college campus
Later a place of research and vistin' planets
Will we eva see this gangster again?
No more Timbs, no more 20 inch rims
All the jewelry don't matter, all his money were scattered
Far as the crumbs his wife could gather
No guns, no beef, just eternal sleep
And all you had you couldn't keep
The hood creeps about a week then soon start to forget
Your memory turns to a history
The nigga you use to had beef wit is now livin' in your project
And that's hell

No time for talkin' backwards
I'ma blow this automatic
Your whole future's goin' down
Goin' down-down-down

What crosses the mind right before you're flatlined
Do you see bright? Do you see night? Do you see Christ?
I wonder what heaven is like?
Paramedics bring life, to we go where each of us came from
One comes cryin', one goes silent
Which is worst? I don't know, it makes my brain numb
When brothers squeeze triggers to cease niggas
Do they think of our future before they shoot ya?
What was it a Pale Horse thoughts of William Cooper
Nailed to a cross, all leads variety of anxieties within my medulla
Kennedy was shot in the head while ridin' the Lincoln
I wonder what Lee Harvey Oswald was thinkin'
When he tried to escape and hide in the theatre
Did he see Mr. John Wilkes Booth in the mirror?
For street cred niggas take heads
For a block they don't even own
The red, blue and gold is in the colors of the rainbow
Heads hang low, when it's a four year old that had to go
No halo, no big bright wings
At the end the dust conquers all of us

Took me a while to find this
I wanna shoutout Jay Elect
And all the Gods..
[
Verse: Killah Priest
]
Was he born in the cosmos, formed in the fossils
Unified the wheels, left the seal where the crops grow
Left shapes that’s visual, cut by a spiritual lawn mower
Did he walk with the apostles? Talk with the gospel
Disappear in a synagogue, or die in mosque old
Or appear with men of god, or discovered the lost scroll
Was he reborn as Van Gogh, Aristotle or Picasso
Was he formed from New York lights or winds from Chicago
How’s he one man? that sounds like an ensemble
Will they dig him up like charcoal, when they find his soul is part gold
Preserve his mind for millions of years, or display it in an art show
Because the words that he uses, only a few can imagine
At night, when I write, my soul infuses with the Dragon
There’s nothing new under the planet, there’s nothing new under Atlantis
There’s nothing new under the sun, you’re confused with the enchanted
I vibrated out of the universe, at nine thousand terahertz
Sound and light formulated, from matter I was due at birth
The story of every plant, animal and human’s birth
They said they built Sumer first, some say it was Egypt
Let’s reveal the secret, they say Lucy was a priestess
An open letter to the church, more mummies more tombs to search
I’ll be out of sight, out of mind, do the work
And I’ll be back at the end of time and I’ll prove my worth

The esoteric fabric of the Universe this is the blueprint, everything in existence comes out of the vibratory state which is called in quantum science quantum mechanics, the unified field

Outro 2

What has been will be again and what has been done will be done again, there's nothing new under the sun
We think that we have the leading edge in technology
""We are the apex"" of the world civilizations but I don't think this is true
More and more despite the foot dragging and... and the, nay saying by archaeologist and historians and everything else
We are more and more coming to learn that apparently at one point there was a planet-wide highly technical civilization on tthis planet... and something happened",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-infinity-lyrics

Sideways from cop cars {*cop sirens*}, echoes through his ears
And the rain blended with his tears, heart full of fear
He's exhausted from the loss of blood, his head is drowsy
He thought to his self, ""Damn, all the fake niggas around me""
So he fought off a thug, breathin heavy
With the weapon in his hand that he held was deadly
His face was sweaty
Damn, what you do when you at the door of life and death?
Plus you staggered 22 blocks, with a bullet in your chest
Plus you soakin wet
You might catch pneumonia, suddenly you smelt smell death's foul aroma
It burnt his nose hairs like ammonia
He inhaled deep then fell asleep
Opened his eyes in Hell
Where he saw every nigga he made the sale
Every crack addict with a bad habit
Every drug users and every needle abuser

Watchin' the secret sands, remind me the extinction of man

All harmonic, Priest is like a god when he speaks
Plants his feet on the ground, wore the crown

See cats on the train beggin' for change
Need medicine for they pain, I'm in heavy rain
Sweat testin' my aim, carve in my bullets with the president's name
Destined to reign, feel guns bust while cats discuss
About the gats they bust, and loyalty among employees
The more weed, the more they mind's stay freed
The more the nines get squeezed, the more the crime leads
The more they blind me, push that light far behind me
I seeked ashanti's and monks in the hills, I dwelled months for real
No deal, but still hold the steel
Sometimes I spaz out, pull my pad out
Then my pad sprouts to a crackhouse, filled with drug dealers
Some thugs, some killers, my pen's a paintbrush
Colorin' the old school cats with gangstas

There stood the king of ancient Babylon
Carry on; I stand like Istanbul for that religion y'all pulled
The king grew more angry, strangely
A strange tree grew in front of the old castle
The tabernacle chapels were all black
His axe, hacked off the heads and arms and legs
A fog from the grave was all gray and thick
The king's ears went pointy and weird
His teeth grew fangs and it hanged from his jaws
The lord of lords, the Moors adored
A cheetah stirred and slept
He leaped runnin' into the night
At night, the light, that the clouds threw
Cut trees into two, the eagle lands in his nest

The flyest suit, but it was all a facade
But somethin' in me was empty
Those mass of smiles was buried by me laughin' out loud
And our nights ended wit countless of women
It was temptin', a smooth dude I befriended
But then he said... and that made me go
Oh shit, then at the end of the night we broke out to a fight
Some he said got to my head
Something about him had me really on edge
And the ho's were laughin', I mean it was embarrassin'
And the devil got mad and told me to take a cab
I said you take a fuckin' cab
This is my car, my whip
All these of chicks, all these ho's that gave me away
This is mine and not yours
I looked 'em in his face
Then a hand touched my shoulder, and said:
""Sir you had too much to drink, come out the bathroom
Get out of the mirror""
Huh? What? Where's Sheila?
Ahhh, now I remember, I had beef wit this mothafucka
Where he at ""Who sir?""
The mothafucka who brought me out here
Nigga was standin' right here
""Sir I don't know what you're talkin' about, but we about to close""
So I staggered to the couch and hit the door
It's cool, you mothafucka ""Get home safe sir""
I feel bad, but I'mma get you",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-drinkin-with-the-devil-lyrics

[Verse 1: Killah Priest & 
Auto-tuned Killah Priest
]
Uh
I'll take your brain around the universe
Like how Uber works
Grab some peppermints
And here's some bottle of water if you in thirst
Now computer search
I dial-up the location, destination, is through this verse
The pen I write with is nuclear
When I sit on my throne all I do is smirk
Easy
I used to catch the train on Kingston to utica
Easy
Came disguised as a jeweler from Jupiter
Pull out your heart to 
the carbon like my
 in the hood
Easy
Holy rhymes that intimidate, Lucifer
Show me any god or king I'm not ruler of
Pull out your heart to  in the hood
On my way to Jerusalem
Whats running through my vein is the super blood
Easy
Yes, I'm Harry Potter of the Chakras
Wait, I'm Harry Potter of Cabalas
My mics magic it entertains toddlers
The unexplained is conjured when i sit with dalai lamas
And deep rastas, puffin marijuana
Moon crickets, pyramid Cabaka
The tombs lifted Lord Fury spit the lava
Killah Priest between pillars my mystique is like a jaguar
Easy
So my condolence to my opponents, for atonement
Easy
Took you apart, put you together like components
You break my bridal to me, losing control
My bars a scripture, trap listeners
Become prisoners of the moment
Government clonin, diss yall till yall faced like christ and the romans
Kill devils, execute satan, persecute romans

Funeral admission, visions, savage rain, 
Flood waters, blood offers, flyin saucer , no warnin",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-carbon-light-lyrics
Crop Circles (iTunes Bonus Track),Elizabeth,2009,"The Democrats never came to my lab or visit my schools
Not cool, I showed up with street dudes to funerals
Can't name a politician I ever took a flick with
Just reminiscing skeptics leave it or accept it
Just listen; president never checked my report card
Television screen keep flashing the sports car
At 16 the rappers on my wall inspired me to floss hard
The newspaper blowing in the wind over the courtyard
Just one more day written on the face of that cross guard
Lil shorties give each other dap
The same time drug dealers reaching for their gat
The same time the fiend head steam up his crack
The same time the lil girl leans on her back
It's just a vine virtues thru the crime hurdles
Sacred topic when I drop it, this is Crop Circles
I use to look at magazines and rap teams, they had millions
Thoughts came to me by the zillions
What if I had that cash?
I probably built a spacecraft made of gold and windows with stained glass
Or recover Christ bones, turn my hood into Rome
Parades every other day, I turn my bed into a throne
But this what happened, a few cats while I was rapping
Knew I had the law of attraction, towards broads I was a magnet
They were frauds, plus I had my own fashion
I was flashing, fellas got jealous
Instead of them seeing my record in plastic
They rather see me wrecked in a casket
Told me if I got rich that would be it
I redesigned the hieroglyph, tried to outlaw the microchip
Try to buy a mothership, loving it
I bring Michael Jackson back
But this time with the diamond in his lap
Getting tattoos, cursing in his interviews
Blowing purple, just don't stop
The wisdom I drop just call the Crop Circles
Peanut butter and jelly, because knuckles and scully
Blame the president, we thought ephedrine was healthy
Jehovah Witness youth at the door
Reagan never cared; he only scared us with nuke and the war
A congresses are convicts, what y'all screwing us for?
I was loose with the jaw; assistance prepared a noose for the poor
Oprah Winfrey never gave us a call
She gives houses away to her audience
What if I'm out in the hall?
Old black man join lodges, young man wear camouflages
Attention to their sergeants, and my sentence is where God is
Essential in my essence, they call 'em the Prophet
But y'all call 'em the artist
Just some virtue, subway train, the Broadway & Myrtle

Dark Evening in Hells Pool,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"These harlots they tear at my flesh, they eat up my soul
Regarded as Job, layin' naked in the Valley of Bones
Skulls of dead woman grinnin', it's scary
Till they're crushed under the foot of a gremlin
Mother Mary, demons screamin', I said ""That I am""
The all eye seein', the skies cryin', I'm freezin'
Icicles on the hairs of my nostrils
The Apostle, light-years, I was there like a fossil
Flood's the blood, mixed in the dirt
Made red mud, slush of guts
I wanna stand up or pull back by sluts
That's when the sky had erupt
Waves of electric white light
Graves across my eye sight
The dark waters have thick mud
It intruded my rich blood
The skies open, the eyes of Omen
Rise of the Roman, ridin' the trojan
Arrivin' ShoGun killin' the Conan
Here's the token, God told 'em his real name
His real name, he told me his real name
He lives again, concealed in the frame
It's still stained, the paint glass peels in the pain

Come take a journey with us
This is light in the form of sound
Sound in the form of light
Cuz when you look Behind the Stained Glass
You see the seven star spectrum

They broke the windows
Their face turned old and wrinkle
Don't stare into the God eyes
Flowin' ash, dark in the sky
The fog that covered the Church part of the syze
A mob begins to fly toward their face
Hell Mary full of grace
Let's exposed Stained Glass
Shoulda neva pulled the drapes

I spit revolutionary, ready to shoot and bury
Presidents, we predicates to the fullest

Che Guevara, I spray whoever, mega
Prophecies, I drop sixteens, that you can watch on screens
It's 
Mackavangelo
, flames and the candles will blow
From the garment, of the God sent, jewels the size of comets
I spit wizardry, with imagery
Of a Panaview film, I take your through realms
From 3D to 4D...

From shot foes, from mouth closed, with they in they drunk out mode
Whether I can brawl or not, never punk out though
So come to one of our shows, see we don't waste any time
I go straight to the Mike, like the Punch-Out code
You're a conscious rapper, you'll be an unconscious rapper
Unless I'm unconscious after all the rum vodka Snapple's
I'm the one, God, I ask ya, why me?
Never mind, I already know what the others won't get it
Til I'm in heaven, so
Many reverends told sinners where they headed tho
They're not God, so like a yes man, you'll never know
Oh, they wanna guess things, without facts
Passing judgments like your honor's breath stinks
Your mistake, I meant to bomb these fuckers
If there's any fucking doubt like Gwen Stefani's drummer
And I'm into comedy, brother
YouTube the video, you gotta feel it
So you could witness the fly up close on screen like Obama killed it

Your wife embrace her for a lab, she said she wanna see through
So I went straight for the ass and gave her the crabs
You faithful and mad, wanna fight me, here we go
I take Life like I stole Mikey cereal
I'm buying all you sell-outs, the hell out
When I stay behind you, but I just raised the bar like I'm the father
Of an ale house
You hot clones, but you not known, you try to diss
I talk to God obtain the deed to your life, you got owned
And your bitch she got boned cuz she goofy
Ask me to buy a drink, so I bought her a round of roofies
If that ain't raw enough, I was war when I stuck gucci guns
And talk tough, I'm suppose to think you hard as fuck?
Go ahead and pull, God, see on Earth your laws do not apply to me
So go ahead and shoot me in the head and you'll die
Call me out, you won't hear Rah rule

Fire Lord,The Untold Story of Walter Reed Part Two,UnKnown,"He stood beside the gate and twist his back, arch holding a stick
Beneath a cliff, his back hard
His face and eyes seem molded and fixed on the beyond
Unknowing, unspoken
He reaches his arms, then turned over to his palms
And said, ""Inside is the writing of the Holy Scribes""
His eyes shut but then slowly rised
He gave off ghostly vibes
Smile his gold teeth shined
""Ah yes, would you like me to explain what's on the walls""
Such a frail frame, his hand shaking as he pointed
""This way, follow me
It's right outside a hollow tree where owls be
Near fountain peak right below powerless creak
Our rates are hourly
Mister, I didn't get your name

Standing in awe at a god",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-fire-lord-lyrics
Blessed Are Those (Original),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It goes: life, difficult times, and mad crimes
Some pay the price, while others refine
Blessed are those who struggle -- God loves you
And Wisdom is the principle thing for Kings and Queens
(repeat 2X)
Many alliance will end, it's like a sad song
From a violin, trapped like Daniel's in the Lion's Den
Tryin to pie-rce the iron skin, of Leviathan
Souls blowin in the violent winds
God help us, if we die in sign, I hear the trials
In the cries of men, that's when the riot begins
Like things never get better, we forever
Servin Ebekenezer, since the days of our ancestors
Slaves to a mad pleasure, building great architectures
Sharp dressers, smart professors
Start my lecture, I build lyrics like a art director
Show it to you like the film projector
Blessed are those who struggle, from day to day we all hustle
Comin home with sore muscles, and scarred faces
Scuffed knuckles, we all share the same trouble
Seperated couples, sometimes it seem like
There's no escapin, the clutches of Satan
Spendin years in state pens, awaitin patient
Dreams of a scholarship, ended by a hollowtip
Politics and number slip
Chorus
Once, shoved in ships, now we Bloods and Crips
Thugs with clips, niggas who love the clicks
Hit the clubs and shit, so they can rub their hips
Hugs and flicks, niggas with drugs and whips
Cash Rules this Rotten Apple, they got a worm in it
Corrupt sinners, in my man's jeep
With the windows tinted, sippin Guinness
Observin all the clinics, and liquor spots
They make me lick a shot through the rooftop
I never seen the glory
In the ghetto it's the same story
Ciggarette butts and cold coffee, black faces
And white mouths, they cry out, for the White House
Ain't no wealth shared, it's welfare
And poor health care, self scared
It's senseless, the way they got our black princess
On public assistance to end our existance

Among Gangsters,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"From apartments to porches, from park bench to corners
From lobbies to alley's, there's warrants a warrin'
Warnin' for flags and dress codes
Death holds everyone for ransom a fresh note
Hit up Escobar's grandson
Responsible for mountains of coke up the U.S. nose
They clamp thumbs and kill wives, it's hand gun if your bill's high
Suicide, two in his thigh, one flew in his eye
It's time you die

What makes a gangster happy
Could make a gangster cry
No mercy in a killer's eyes
Those time flies, niggas get high
Babies are born, gangsters die
Which way we choose is up to you to decide

The never world bosses, warehouse office
Collect the shares and count their losses
Then extortion, their girls are gorgeous
Underworld wit Porsche's
Nauseous, bullets break champagne, enormous
Analyzin' the fortune, crime lords across the chair board
Cigar smoke, expensive painting on the walls
Which hears them all, this place is bugged, it's tapped
They hired a rat; grab the gut to make me trapped
Now how we gon' pat

What makes a gangster happy
Could make a gangster cry
No mercy in a killer's eyes
Those time flies, niggas get high
Babies are born, gangsters die
Which way we choose is up to you to decide

Gun battles, kidnappin' murder
Betrayal, unleash the demons of the never world
Grab the pearls, sexy girls, sheer stockin'

Thug's option, shoot his way out
Or sleep eternal in a grave house or slave route
Hide-out, Nat Turner, gats will learn ya
Collapse wit the burner
Dead fingers clutch, his tongue out
Floor full of guts, his horse screamin' pullin' him up
Damn you shoulda ducked

No mercy in a killer's eyes

Daddy Rose; they said they keep him
So I plan to get even, they got me and my team on defense
No justice, we ain't leavin', Impala engine Chevy LT 1's

See I do it for my niggas and y'all do it for me

From out my beehive, which is in the slums I'm from

And I hit hard, so kids whip tar
Nowadays I spit bars till I zip to the stars
But don't get it twisted; tho I deal wit the physics
You can still get wit the biscuit
Tho I'm mystique but real
And scientific, kick truth you can feel
That's that G/Ciple, just that G title will get you status
Your crew's cross paths, but now cross wit the baddest
Everybody who betrayed
Thought the devil was gon' get you play

Here it go baby... genesis..

Back in the days, it was much like this
Inspirations make me wanna reminisce
It's my genesis, it's the life, it's the love
It's my genesis, hook this mic to a plug

Afros to box braids, locks and waves
Fades, to flat tops, it came, the boxing game
The bus stop, the pop locks and spades
Knuckles, doin' the hustle, I chuckle
That's me the young dude, playin' kung fu
Run to the store to get more junk food
Hero and a small Sundew, hard headed
That's why I flunked school, back in the days
When the Bishops and the Lords used to rumble
That's a Brooklyn thing, the hoodlum reign
Shots go off at block parties
Muslims and God Bodies and big posses
Different crews from different schools, it was school
Grandma watchin' the news, I'm dodgin' principals
Graffiti writers, guess who's on Riker's
Guess who's pregnant? Guess who's the lifer
To Laudi prom, robbin' the ciphers
Don't mess with Sun God, he's a fighter
It was, '80's, Michael Jackson and leather jackets
Bicycle fashion, my last words of a king when he's rapping
Swing flurries like a champ when he scrapping
Grew up fad, notepad, that's all I had
It's the only thing that bring me back to past


It's the Priest, bless like sheeps in white sheets
Clothes fit me like robes, right to the T
Pearls huggin', back up, me and wifey
It's so elegant, my words add flesh to skeletons
Once it's heard, it covers the flesh from element
It's the medicine, take it for the soul
It's better than gold, Proverbs, makes your pops burst
Starbust, above God's Earth
And the moonlight, I move like a Greek move degrees at night
I write movies that masterpiece, the cornerstones my poem
I lay bricks like a mason, my words can move a nation
Throw pens out the page, the same way you pull a pen out a grenade
And watch it explode, yo, my mind explode, divine and glow
Back to the days, where the rhymes was made


*singing along to the beat*
Yo, come on, let me hear ya'll sing it, it go
*singing along to the beat*

Thousand of Omens will rise
As I unveil hell's terrible tyrants
Look deeper to my irus
See the black streets around my eye lids

Welcome,Welcome EP,UnKnown,"Ahhh hahaha - come with me to the hood
Killers, thieves and murders

Beneath the pale Moon the night watches the goons
Hop in the costume dressed as killa clowns
As death feel the town niggas surround
They see grave near the Marry Go Round
Beneath the slave burial ground
(What else you see?) There's blood on the pavement
There's thug in the states
There's Cops from patrol just watching with soul
I turned hot to turn cold, something's burning my soul
It's the Brimstone, fill it when the wind blown
Push my skin against the bones
I cringe as I smell stitch from the chrome
Its home, the projects, bitches gossip the Glock clips
Cops sick, just watch shit, when T.V. brainwash it
The pain of the Projects, a slow process
No progress I'm held hostage with thieves
Receive princely fees after they empty your sleeve
Your enemy squeeze, Tec .9, its death and crime
It's all stress something that's left is blind
It's the prognosis of Moses
The Jones', the hopeless, the homeless
The oppress and slow death souls are left, no rest
Shootouts everyday like the old West

Who'd you rather serve? God or Devil?
Welcome into Earth's graveyard with shovel
Or do you rather be amongst the living and enjoy your life?
Observing the stars from distance the voyage of light

Each day I hunger, feeling my days are numbered
If I go under, who will be there to raise my son up?
Feeling discomfort it's sounds like I'm hearing the trumpets
Blowing across the sky feels like the spirits are coming
By drilling and pumping, stealing is corruption, face with women seduction
Sitting and fucking the beginning was nutting
Genesis forbidden the plucking'
From the trees of Adam & Eve
Gathering leaves, the madness it sees
The magnum will squeeze, handguns and weed
From the days of Egyptian clay powders
Since the days of grave robbers to the days of slave drivers
On the Mayflowers, they gave us powder
Nowadays our devoured, we're afraid of the power
Like cowards we lay in the shower, pray for what's ours

Who'd you rather serve? God or Devil?
Welcome into Earth's graveyard with shovel
Or do you rather be amongst the living and enjoy your life?
Observing the Stars from distance the Voyage of light

The Sun darkens, the Moon's covered with blood
I'm in the projects, in a room with couple of thugs
We all share hugs light candles, sit in circles
And read from the ghettos manual
As I open the book filled with crooks, thieves with dirty looks
Pictures of killers and niggas and drug dealers
We all get the chills but we still keep turning the page
I'm burning some siege
Beneath the red light bulbs, read the life of thugs
Sort of image of Knight, some blood, some gloves
Some slugs, some ice, some fights in clubs
Ivory tribal are like Africans they mad tribal
We close our eyes too, the ghetto bible have recitals
Think all about our rivals, draw tattoos on our back too
My man just got one of a fat pterodactyl, we eat fast food

Who'd you rather serve? God or Devil?
Welcome into Earth's graveyard with shovel
Or do you rather be amongst the living and enjoy your life?
Observing the Stars from distance the Voyage of light

Close the Book, that's enough
Until next time, I'll tell you more tales
More dark imagery and show you more pictures, come on!

G/Ciples,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"Alone in the desert, in the zone wit the chrome weapon
Eyes shut, back, touchin' kiss the Stonehenge's
Think of myself, yeah I'll be my own legend
From the pavement till we made the throne connection
Stare deep in the ozone, see the crescent
Lightsabers shoot, turn the sky fluorescent
Since we fell from grace we became Nephelims
Now we regulate everythin' from here to a wide spectrum
G/Ciples, baggy jeans but the gun's pressin'
Devils let the Ds sketch 'em, all white chalk
Look up see the white hawk
G/Ciples driven by a light force

Behold the spiritual force endorsed from the source of the universe
This the birth of the sun, Solar Biology
Planet and stars form around the 19th Galaxy
This the Rapture of the 24 elders
144,000 were captured within a tetrahedron
Planet X 2012, the Zodiac marks the
Arrivin' of the Aquarian age
The next stage where the mind and soul battle between
Wit this G/Ciple in a D/Ciple

In a D/Ciple, enemies and rivals
Bleedin' in a Y-pool, squeezin' my rifle
Flee our rival, on ya knees for survival
Believe or you'll die fool
Niggas hate cuz when we speak
We talk like we hidin' the fleet
We discuss like Zion's at reach
They say when you listen to Priest
It feels like you sittin' in Greece
Verses' calm and peace
Then you hear bombs then missiles release
They say his eyes was red wit wine
His face's like its bred wit lion
Speech like it's laid wit lead and iron
Heavy, G/Ciple we triumph

Kill a legion of you crabs
United Snakes of America
And to the Republic of all you fags
An abomination of your pagan Gods
Invisible & visual, injustice
And all peace to all, we at war wit St. Igor's
We the law writers, so your law don't apply to us
God guide us, we are survivors
We bring the sword to liven things up
""O' Emmanuel"" I got a bag full of shells
Ready to shoot for justice and hand me his rail
Full of his blood, you showed us ya love
And for that we ready to blow slugs at
The CIA, FBI, FEMA and SWAT
Our nina's cocked, try to become between us, get shot
We're like David & his Mighty Men
Feel God when we write wit the pen
Fear God when we fight to defend
Men wit no name, no job, no fame, no money, no house
But somehow we own everything
Priesthood, peace-wood
Bring it back the practice, no distraction",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-g-ciples-lyrics
My World,The Untold Story of Walter Reed,UnKnown,"The gangsters I know place guns on tables
While they're eatin' their cereal
Don't you know that's dangerous?
They're quick to bang shit
Around the house, on the phone wit some lame chicks
Look at you funny when you're talkin' knowledge
Look at you hungry when you're talkin' dollars
They love cartoons, only time they laugh
The X-Box, Playstation, move on your last man
They play Mortal Kombat
Wait for their lawyers to call back
We pack and G-stack and squeeze gats
They all got cases, welcome to the underworld nation
Where niggas wear mask like Jason
A heart like Satan, gun spark give you a spankin'
Of conglomerates of arm lunatics
And when there's sudden movement or jumps they're shootin' shit
My niggas in the wheelchairs keep the burner on the lap
And anybody act up, they get the clappin', Mac-10s
Niggas wear face of ice and cement, hover by minister and demons
Out their ears and they're comin' and leavin'
Good evenin' and welcome to my hood
(Hook) 2x
Welcome to my world where I come from
There's a place called the slums where I come from

Niggas failed their class in math
But know how to breakdown an ounce into a gram
Look at it, tell you how much can go into a bag
They're great accountants
Breakdown ki's in the amount they spent
Know how much owed from who and when
They're like lab scientist when crack is cookin'
Ask my homeboy Matt from Brooklyn
He said: ""Niggas don't got majors in Geology
But professors in scholars at Streetology
Criminology, Prison Philosophy""
Athletes when they're runnin' from police
Poppin' benches and fences like they want the medal from the Olympics
Bobby got a shotty in the trenches
Crackhead finds that crack don't need forensics
For instant, relentless, I stand where homicide stood
Raised in Brooklyn, welcome to the hood
(Hook) 2x

The ghetto street chew up - it's bricks
The bricks eat thru the wall
The wall is now on an apartment
The apartment tears apart two room to a kid
The kid stands up, begin eatin' his skin
His skin dissolves his bones
His bones swallow the marrow
Grabs on to his soul
His soul comes out, eats his spirit
It gets scary cuz these streets we live in
A killin', robbin' murderous village called the ghetto
Every nigga livin' in it is like waitin' on death row
Come down the Walls of Jericho
Spray rounds at five-o
High five, hit the hydro, street survival
Epic deep tribal, I heard blood say as it ooze from the body
Say to the semen: ""Good evenin', greetings but I'm grievin'""
The semen asked why, blood said:
""Well I probably be stepped on
I'd rather be swimmin' thru my owners arm
Comin' from my owners heart
This never endin' story gets dark""

The Abyssinian Sword,Best of Killah Priest & A Prelude to the Offering,2008,"Yea niggas, its Priesthood back up in this motha'fucka bitch
Yea niggas, tear niggas down, +The Offering+ is comin' soon
Yo, the next beat yo

I sit back watchin' The Discovery Channel on Hannibal
Wonderin' if it's sortin' Elephant intangible, Priest is animal
I can result to a Cannibal
Fly ya motha'fuckin head like its put into catapult
Or turned to a T-Rex, dependin' on what beats next
I rock fatigue ya niggas rock v-necks
I slap a rapper in Brooklyn so hard - the nigga get up out of the BX
Is that ya man? Well you'll be next
I literally push a nigga face in
'Til it come out in the other end
'Til he see his crew out the back of his head runnin'
""Like yo dawg don't fuck wit him""
And while you thinkin' of a rhyme
I sprinkly season on yo ass
I got pots cookin', this is not the lookin'
This nigga don't see it comin', I'ma make a pasta wit 'em
Two shots for Brooklyn, two shots for BIGGIE and Jay
Fuck that peace can make his own piggy bank
Ya'll wanna name names -- but see I fuck wit Nas and I fuck wit Jada
Fuck wit D-Block and fuck all you haters
I fuck wit Ra, fuck wit Canibus
I fuck wit real niggas who can spit
Who can do it like this?
You shake my hand I crush your fingers and pop your wrist
And if a nigga respond to me -- he gon' to bleed
Fuck a rap group, we gon' to need an Army
And I got nuclear rhymes, so you gotta get use to these lines
I'm like George Bush before the buttons pushed
Niggas loosin' they mind, I snap your back like broom for a spine
Priest is an epidemic, invented inside a clinic, define all rap and end it
Wit punch lines to give a nigga crenches
And When I spit the Statue of Liberty flinches
My sentences go inside a niggas heart and rip it apart
This is heart, this is Mozart, on acid you bastard
You a fuckin' faggot, open that nigga casket put 'em in
Ya haven't met the strangler, I got a torcher chamber
Wit ya names on and I name ya, I rearrange ya, cremate ya
I'll change ya, I complicate ya, you in constant danger
I use a nigga air for souvenirs
Your blood and guts all up in the mic booth smeared
Nigga use to screw face, now his face is on screws
Hangin' up in my crib, this is what I do to you
I use your head as a vase, Priest is a beast
A dark force, A dinosaur wit lock jaw
A killin' machine the breathin' guillotine
A demon hearin' your scream, you?re bleedin'
I'm still in ya dreams I'm not leavin'
I'm like the curse of Emily Rose when I entered your soul
And I kill you from the inside out
First let me burst your heart, then cry out
And your scream sounds like music to my ears from a beat machine
It's sweet to me; I listen to it like its classical music
I bring through it, I beat your ass wit a motha'fuckin' pool stick
Poke ya eye balls out wit a tooth pick, want me to prove it?
I'll do it; I'll spit 'til my mouth is all white
Like it's covered wit cool whip, BITCH!, +The Offering+ nigga, Priest!
I'm comin', I'm comin'",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-abyssinian-sword-lyrics
Movie,Black August: Revisited,UnKnown,"To the listeners, here's a movie
I write in black and white, or color
It goes deeper than Warner Bros., or Steven Spielsberg
You can feel the words, I write rhymes you can see
It's not just punch lines, it's a movie, it's a movie

For all the land there's Earth

Inside my head, there's an auditorium, with rows of empty chairs
Right above, light bulbs fill the chandeliers
Right below, there's a balcony, that's where I would be
I look again, now there's crowded seats
And an audience surrounding me, the lights go low
And out of nowhere, my notepad glows
Then a motion screen show, my paper becomes a movie screen
Each word is a character that plays a part in the scene
You start to see pictures, but it's only for the listeners
Welcome to the theater


For the admission, all you gotta do is pay attention
My ushers guide you, to where I'll be sitting
It's the intermission, all you gotta do is listen
To get a clear vision, the way I be spitting
The story changes with the rhythms
It comes at you in 3D, it's not just a CD
It's more like DVD (to tape it), I turn radios to TV's
My pen: the projector, and I'm the director
Each line guides my recta, I turn looseleafs to whole movies
Color show is Rudy, a film written by him, rated KP
Bring your lady or your babies, sit through the album
Turn up the volume, stare at the speakers
Til suddenly your in the bleachers
Lookin' at the main features, viewing the coming attractions
Guns blastin', tons of action


I got love stories that turn gory
From Mafia hits, to politics, follow my lips
Acknowledge my flicks, once I stopped writing, the room brightens
I pick up my pen, then the movie ends
I stop the flow, then the curtains close
The audience stands and leaves the rows
At the same time, another group comes to see the show
I put down my pen, then the movie plays again
It's the vision, what I'm sayin', rewind the time in your mind
Yo, sit back, the seat reclines, you read the credits
A barrage of letters, the ink comes up in cartoons
I'm in a dark room, the words become characters
Actors, with leading roles
I talk from the bullhorn, which is the pen I hold
Capital letters become buildings filled with children
Or merry-go-rounds, lights, cameras, action, the stereo sound
My pen's a wooden puppet, and I'm the ventriliquist
I turn listeners to the vision-ists
My hands written in scripts from Gods to gangstas
To painters, to King Tut, what up?
To entertainers, it's all good, when I write
With this piece of wood, it's a movie",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-movie-lyrics
Unknown Source,UnKnown,2019.0,"Verse 1
My life's a open scripture to a motion picture
Director god writer myself starring me age 12
The storyline is a shorty divine glorious time made it through hell blackouts the crack house my nephew smiled made em a sell packed on Rikers isl the grave or the jail
Many hung there self in the cell you brave till you tell
Many never graduated or graded from Yale
From what the OGs told me he spoke ghostly
But every things real.. thats its suppose to be hand on his steel close to me soon as it get real we both can reach
But now I'm up in the age but still touching the page with rage
Brushing my grays I call these the luxury days
Its just a stage or a phase
Wiping the dust like Lazarus this is my exodus
From you baphomets laugh at this you savages this is practices musical metaphysical movement for requiring the optimal with smoothness
The Alex Haily in Pelle Pelle my novels are deadly
Colossal and heavy the rap model is legendary
I got quotes from popes these secrets from masters of occults
Even the prophets wrote
They said 'Unknown' look how much you grown
This is chess..your pawns are thrones this is finesse your songs a zone
Whenever I'm at the microphone surround that spot with orange cones
The monotone-god is home
Ring around the rosie my crew was pack of wild coyotes
Play records by Bon Jovi
Hold it spin it backwards listen to metallica slowly
You hear the teachings of Aleister Crowley
Mind balanced between malice and holy drink from a chalice thats smokey
For thanksgiving I flew to Turkey capture the statute Sophia as a trophy
Everywhere i step grows bodhi trees i'm moses seed
Golden beads mr reed mostly

Ok back to the movie black was beauty
Hundred brothers packed with kufi's universal flags
Du-rags news flash cash and jewelry
Details official site Brooklyn country USA language forgotten
Cause our ancestors pick cotton
And there ancestors was Akhenaten
Before that its was astrologic the last of the prophets
Its catastropic release date was coolin 3 mcs tape
Never hit the box office cause we were in the box warring
The company credits was every brother and sister that the feds deaded
My soundtrack was underground rap weed and outta town with crack packs
A lot never made it back suitcase with a hundred grand
Till that dog nudge his hand should of dropped it and ran damn
Now he with the folks the court room is white like coke
His life on a tight rope so just chill and light some smoke
So just zone just zone just zone just zone this is unknown

Wu Hoo Freestyle,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"I spit fire; exist in worlds that may be higher than yours
Little boys run play wit your toys
Fingerprints in the universe, I move asteroids
Paranoid, I go deeper than you, pass a void
Rap, enjoy art full of secrets, come rappers, get destroyed
They call me the King of the Heathens, for reasons
I start squeezin', buss off rhymes, like a couple of nines
Cup full of wine; sip the niggas that's trippin'
My mind's a millennium, shootouts in space and Amphibians
Plenty guns, African race and half Indian
One third Phoenix bird and Reptilian
Dark-ages, new-age, call me Mantanian
Chair turn into a throne, I'm Justinian
Ruthless, fist turn into stone, I kill many men
Nine-hundred souls of God
Seven universes of sun, moon, the globe and the star
It's in my heart, so of course in God's form
When I spit, niggas just don't hear my shit, they log on
Check the inbox, when I press in, it's Hip-Hop
Homepage of rage, more things to watch
I send 'em a link, the more they think...
Pop-up, hard luck, bars of snuff, the screen touch
Within my head is all a jury of King Tut
I hard and I jerk off my pen, my ink bust
I cobra clutch the mic wit incredible grip
I spit unforgettable shit, till your edible click
Your Beretta's don't spit, you have barrette and some hips
No homo, fuck around, you'll be in medical stip
The rhyme pump shotty, gave 'em a hell of a lift
It's the 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'
All can bleed, force from, tank top tattoos
But his name is Shirley, early",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-wu-hoo-freestyle-lyrics
People,Black August: Revisited,UnKnown,"(People) Is the world we live in
Full of innocent, Yasa's word, we the victims
(6 billion people) To the suburban area
Filled with doctors and lawyers
Cops and judges, we all suffer from paranoia
(6 billion people) From the White House to Hollywoods
To everybody hood, to down south, to deep in the woods
From my hood (people) to my hood, let's make it better, overstanding
(People) To six million people, that on this planet

As the moon appears like a pearl in the mists of the clouds
I move up through the shadows til I'm at the cliff of the aisle
I sit overlooking, the borough of Brooklyn
As the Devils start to settle and the cement is pushed in
The ghetto comes to life, you can feel it's pulse
I hear, every corner breathing like the streets awoke
It grabs you, it makes you, so you can't escape
It's the phantom, it haunts us, it changes shape
And the building's most chiling, described by children
As the gateway to Hell, it holds the ghosts of millions
Come close to it, it gives you the most grossest feelings
As the black sky open up, my soul is exploding
Back down to the surface, where these seeds are nurtured
With alcohol and drugs, which leads to murders
Born poor, broke and hungry that's when thieves emerges
But to, rob their own, defeats the purpose, and


I write for children, who really can't express their feelings
I'm their voice, their thoughts, the way they talk
I'm their worries, their fears, their dreams, nightmares
Through that tunnel of darkness, I'm the light that's there
Just stare, look into my endless eyes
See a child walking on stage, his very first time
And the same in the White House when light goes out
The night comes down, the Earth leases unrighteous sound
With gunshots, echoing, through the dark
It's the sand of the ghetto's heart
Put your ear to the ground, you can hear it pound
Subway trains, run through the tunnels like blood through his veins
People in cells, carry like fluid to the brain
Clouds filled with red rain, the sewage drains as the nostrils
And I'm the arsenal, I'm here to set fire, til the entire empire is on",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-people-lyrics
Warfare,The Exorcist,2009,"Grab guns, soldier fatigues, black rosary beads
Black candles held in many prayers are under my breath
Spread death to the snake tight
Snappin' cobras all around me
Talkin' to my coffin, I'm ridin' till they see my brake lights
Y'all must hate life, love death
I suggest a blood fest
Let the slugs open the thug's chest
I do an autopsy on your body
Makin' incision wit the slug from the sawed-off shotty
Blood splashin' the white walls make you look sloppy
You got the drop on me, I go kamikaze
All hail Priest the Great
I'm back to eatin' steak and cleanin' the plate
Any beef y'all wanna grill, fried or baked
Crabs in the bucket, I add the onion
Powder, makin' chowder, wit the old bane
Let the water broil till it souffl
Whoeva claim king I'm slayin'
Assassinator, I'm grabbin'
Juxin', slashin' till they gaggin'
Head in some plastic, nails on the plague pit
Fuck king, I'd rather be a killer
Achilles, Philly's, no one's realer

""Deadly warfare, blood-thirsty""
""Devil smirks I grab a gun and blow off his grin""
""Gotta hunger for the mic""
""Here's a lesson from God, show 'em how we rode hard""
The grippin' tale of the killer's hell
Will he prevail? Oh well
Stakes around his building where his enemy's impaled
He crossed the path of black dolls
Black dolls wit scary eyes oh Mary cries
Black blood you slip, try to stand, fall back in the tub
Crack your skull on the metal forces
Bones and crosses, gray skeleton tones ridin' horses
Aren't you tired of flossin'?
My losses can't amount to my mom's fortune
So go'head Knight me, like I'm King Arthur
For freedom, I do it like Leonidas did for Sparta
The 300 of G Ciples, squeeze rifles
Take on enemies and rivals
Who want it? Sound the trumpet
Aim for the chest, neck and the stomach
Death is comin', the art of seduction
You honor my thuggin', my palms are destruction
My Psalms are instruction
Basic Before Leaving Earth
I'm at the grave-ship when I'm meetin' work

The killers and dealers and niggas
And go see the essence of the ghetto
The Devil's hell flows over wit lava
Shot us wit revolvers
Gun chargers, help us dear Father
Last night the spirit of a hustler came to me in all black
His lips were cracked, he followed my tracks
His skeleton, half exodus face
He spoke of his fate, its ghost in the race
It left no trace, I just heard a voice
It's tellin' me to make a wise choice
Life is too short; you live it to the limit
I fell lucky for this privilege

So recognize, recognize
Recognize, recognize

Look at life as precious and its essence
Destined for perfection, young ones show regression
Adolescence learn adult lessons of cult progression
Out in Bohemian Grove, nina's and robes
Bathin' in no clothes, goat heads of more lead
In the Middle East rulin' elites
Facts of force hood, the mysteries or Lady Liberty
Killin' spree, niggas is free, not quiet yet
You neva know what your life to expect
Build wit the mind, like mine
Stay wise, civilize, and recognize
(Hook)

For the butyric habits of the doctor's tablets
They both addicts, pharmaceutical is illusional
Still end up in the funeral
I use the musical to display the message
Radios don't play these records
Try downloads or underground shows around the globe
Crown glows on my black hairs, rappers beware
I give you back those years
Priest-Obama, flow drama, coat of armor
The owl and the lion and the Madonna wit child
Stay fly, open ya minds, 3rd eye and listen
And just recognize

Though it's hard to understand you, my love
I send you a dove, sweet melodies & motions above
Jo' we almost a same, I soak in the rain
Calling your name, passions from past time
Float through my brain, from your neck to your solarplex
And know enough sex, your shoulders and breath
Heaven blessed, I can rest every part with the art
Before we depart, I got something to say

I still got love for you
The kind that'll make your blood boil
Our love, will always be royal
Plant my seeds inside your fertile soil
And when I dug in, I struck oil
I still got love for you
Huh, I still got love for you
Uh, I still got love for you

Your my love, my black pearl, my girl
A ruby, you're all my jewelry
Your hair smells like pear
I love it when your in underwear
I go in your brassiere
Though you left me, my dear
I know one day you will return
In my stomach there's a flame that burns
And a pain that yearns, but I adore you
I still got love for you


Baby, I love your instructions
The way you got me sucked in, I'll start nuttin'
Diggin' your back out, yo, until I blackout
It's so deep, I can't write it down
Cuz the way that I'm feeling now
My heart just pounds, like a rock upon the ground
Cuz the way that I'm feeling you
Is always been true
I eat your fruit, you sip my juice
It's so deep, I won't get no sleep
At night, I can't even rest
Thinking about you on my chest
Baby, meant to be together forever
Yo, no matter what's the weather
We will go through the storm
We will carry on, and on and on
We will carry on, and on and on
I got love for ya


Baby, you just got to understand
These demons, they got the upper hand
But if you wait, I'mma show you the plan
Will show you how to stand
Against the trials & tribulations
Yo, ain't no tribute to Satan
Forget them cats, just let them keep hating
I'm talking to your spirit
And I know you could feel it
If you out there, and if you care
Yo, give a nigga a call
Sometime, baby, sometime, sometime
Cuz you on my mind, sunshine, sunshine

I still got love for you
The kind that make your blood boil
Not the kind that make you royal

The Virgin Pt.1,The Curse of a Virgin (Bootleg),UnKnown,"'The Virgin' carried by four Rabbis'
The arrow fly, hit the painting
Portrait cries, the view on the paint changes
Looks toward the enemy's castles
The cannons explode, they're hit by their own shrapnel's
The view on the paint changes again
Looks toward the other end
Opposing army starts suffering
Disease's the death of their Caesars
Believers of 'The Virgin', turban wrapped
I walk whole in the urban map
I now possess the portrait from the 1400's
I lift the cloth and right to her face
Crush grapes, stern in my vase
I put the curse on you rappers
Disaster - meet y'all at daybreak
Funerals flooded wit brothers, the Reaper at their wakes
I turn 'The Virgin' towards them to destroy them
Spoiled limbs fall off, their eyes close, they die slow
When I expose them to 'The Virgin'

Hail Mary full of grace
Help me lead my enemies toward their graves
If they follow - sleepy hollow
May they walk the path creepy shallow
Death is certain once they meet The Virgin

Rappers I tatted unto my skin
So I'm Leviathan with the iron pen
Angels will burn, Hell will freeze
I impale emcees once they stare at The Virgin
Blackness emerging with nightmare
Blood drip from his right ear
Cotton mouth, feet go numb
I start rotting out, have y'all forgot about
The Priest and The Virgin
My page there is engraved
My pen is a Cherubim
And crossover, cross back as a Seraphim
I sever limbs, tear off skins, beware of him
He who possess The Virgin

Hail Mary full of grace
Help me lead my enemies toward their graves
If they follow - sleepy hollow
May they walk the path creepy shallow
Death is certain once they meet The Virgin

Castles wit skull walls, thrones made from emcees' bone
I sit alone inside this dome
Carpets made from dead flesh of MCs who want it next
My haunted hex, pentagram flow
My hologram souls inside of Pandora's Box
Just torture, y'all watch, the portrait
I push swords through limbs, none of y'all live
Guns to ya wigs, my wizardry is witchery
I turn emcees on spics, watch 'em fricassee
From the sea century
Come one from behind the Sun, the Devil and God and one name
I came to bring the metal and rod and some chains
Thy come to bring y'all under the Earth
While y'all under the curse of The Virgin
From the furnace, Priest, I speak dark words
Grave sentences, a fake entrance
9th Templar, remember I sent ya
From my cloak, my dagger, rapper's
Justinian Niger Rider, dust enter inside your skeleton
Spider crawls up outside ya, burn with fire
Do not disturb 'em; he has the curse of The Virgin",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-virgin-pt1-lyrics
The Chase,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"I killed the devil now they lookin' for me
His demons were schemin', I ran out the project wit the Glock 40
Cocked, bumped into a cop, grabbed this shorty
Hopped in the ride, peel off and drive
Got on my thigh, swervin' towards the Church
On some Da Vinci Code, windows low
Wind blow, it's windy yo
I stick my head out speedin', deep breathin'
My eyes closed, I done it
Fires of hell is jumpin'
Babylon the greatest toll, The Harlot Woman
Turn back into the ancient stone face and begins crumblin'
Out of the unfenced corners of creation
The body of all God's children escapin'
I pull up outside of the Church
Saw my mother first, kissed her on the cheek
Quick, where's the Reverend, (""Doin' the Lord's work"")
I ran inside, he's on his knees, get up we G's
I killed the devil, we free, rejoice
(You what? You did what? What he said?)
(The devil is dead, what's he said?)
(The devil is dead, what he said?)
(The devil is dead)
He lyin', he denyin', nah I'm tryin', what he said?
(The devil is dead) What? The devil is dead?
(The devil is dead) The devil is dead?
You mean dead, dead?
(The devil is dead) What?
What he said? (The devil is dead)
So we partied up, somebody came up in the Church and lit a blunt
Almost made me drop my Hennessy in my cup
It was crazy, the Church turned to a party
A smoke house, 70's music, electric slide broke out
Grandma and the Preacher did the Hustle
Even the choir boy bust a move
I made it, do what it do
I sat back, I thought about all the times, all the harsh crimes
Times we sold crack, the time we had to get strapped
All my dudes up in the mac's, first blowin' their gats
To all my niggas that neva comin' back
That's deceased in the streets
A tear made his way to my lids
So many brothers and sisters doin' bids and neva lived
So all the Gods and Muslims did their thing, even the Hebrews
And everybody came and danced and let go of their egos
Cuz we all God's people, and that was my job
It was done, it wasn't fun, but I killed the devil last night
Yeah he tried to put up a fight, but I caught 'em
I was lookin' for that mothafucka for a long time, a long ass time
So my job is neva done, next time I see you brother
I'm gon' hand you God's gun, and don't get uptight
Just know I killed the devil last mothafuckin' night
Yeah, yessir
The devil that was inside of me
The devil was inside all of us",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-chase-lyrics
The Coming,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009,"Pyramid forms, Kufis and dashikis
Books of loose leafs, appear in the tide beach
It's weird, but I'm here, amongst 12 Monks for months
Waitin' on me to write, and the pages they stay blank
For days I think, days turn into years, to engrave my ink
No words, no sounds is heard
Just observe wit the patience of a decade that God has served
Thoughts came slow like a plant when it grows
My brain is the soil, my mind is the hose
It can't hold, sweat drips off my chin
Onto a damp robe, and the flame and lamp goes
The example of a Prophet, a genius, a new Jesus
All of us whisper; ""What will he leave us?""
Tension breaks, the look on my face goes
From curious to serious
My arms drop, then my palms jab, the greatest lesson
The answers to age's questions
To keep the ancestors and atheist guessin'
They look inside my book, and the words say...
""Love thy neighbor as I thy would love thyself""
It's Priest, peace, much prosperity and health",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-coming-lyrics
The Long Ride,I Killed the Devil Last Night,2009.0,"(Intro)
( lockup ) I really done it this time, I can't believe this
(Man up, stop talking)
I'm just a kid man, I broke my mom's heart

Starring out the prison bus windows
And mountains of snow only 17 with 40 to go
Thinking of all the pussy, weed and drinking he be missing
Damn why the judge wasn't leniant on my sentence?
Hit the prison system
Grew up a victim now he's faced with killers
Premonition you envision gotta make it nigga
Try lifting weights to get in shape
Spoons are scraped for wounds to make tatoos on face...
That afternoon he was raped
He decides that he couldn't take it
Make himself a cloth bracelet
Put it on his neck draw his breath
Last test may you rest in peace or in pieces
According to the laws of the street shit
Nine releases, pits walk off of leashes
Crime increases, Crip chalk line on his cement
Behind the precinc
A good friend you find you gotta keep it
Snakes will try to buy ya secrets, try to find ya weakness
For jealousy reasons I'm tired of telling these heathens
Overwhelmed by these demons
Secret meetings kinda swelling ya melon from what ya man is speaking
Open they closets see skeletons reaching
My rebellion strategic
Teach it grab the nine and squeeze it
See I live it and breathe it
Raised in poor schools where the principals are parapalegic
90 percent of the students a failure for reading
No elder achievement just welfare receiving
Who do you believe in?  God or this Government?
The stars and they publicist
It's hard cover-age school yards pushing drugs on kids
Drug dealers lost they minds
Little kids shooting everywhere no aim cross that line
No morals we be judged for that
Slug or crack no-ones loyal just a shoulder shrug
Perhaps we went way past the borders we going to far
Save my babies from the street but mom I'm going to far
Back of a cops car I box wit God
Wrestle with devils play chess with death seduced by my ghetto
Play dice with my life a flirter of murder
Tease the grave courted my sanity slept with my rage
If life's a bitch then deaths a bastard the presents the gift
I guess that what make me a rapper
My mind , my pen, my pad that's the ministry
The holy trinity, only serenity, divinity
My pen will squeeze footage in booklets of Brooklyn
For hoodlums I put lens on pens and push film for ends!",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-long-ride-lyrics
The Virgin Pt.2,The Curse of a Virgin (Bootleg),UnKnown,"(Killah Priest)
Underworld Governments, rich rules, dark wizard brew
They lick blood from her wrist
Witch weddings, secret sermons
Goat beheading, the oath before the brederens
Private sessions, smoke assend to heaven
These mens are Nephilims, Hilary or Hitlery
Obama or Obamination, the mystery of iniquities
Conscious serpents of Satan faces the Queen of England
Queen Mary stand before the King's buried
They all are kindreds
Great Britain, across the face written
I had a vision I was cosmically swimming
Not trying to go under but gravity kept grabbing me
Head first down the cavity
I heard the gnashing of teeth
I heard a dragon breathe
I'm moving at a slow travelling speed
Just a small speck of dust
I'm worm sliding through the Nebulous
Just my luck, that's all our verse flush
I'm spiraling downward, I woke up 6 in the morn'
Benny Hinn was on speaking about the Beast wit ten horns
Iraq and Lebanon, I turn the seven psalms
From a lake a head respond; its war
Priest I'm steady wit the sword, I'm ready Lord
(Chorus) Priest 2x
Hail Mary full of grace
Help me lead my enemies toward their graves
If they follow - sleepy hollow
They walk the path creepy and shallow
Death is certain once they meet 'The Virgin'
(Killah Priest)
Blood in the eyes of a painting, Jesus - Satan
Idol worshipping Pagans, crucifixion
Whose true religion, Islamic - Jewish tradition
God talked to Adam, Lucifer listens
That's the perfect Judas intentions
Mariology, scholars read bones
Anthropologies, fossils in seas - Theologians
Thrones Greek and Romans - Theia chosen
Anglican Church, rebellion of the Turks
Ottoman, follow him, keys of Solomon
Masonic, demonic, catch me leaning up in the project
Head wrapped wit a towel like a Pharaoh
Kool G apparel, Jewish castle, who wanna battle?
Enter the curtains of 'The Virgin'
Amongst the merchants attack you like the King of the Persians
Witness the sermon, weed burning
D's lurking the streets of the urban, circling serpents
Where a red devil sit on the roof throwing lightning down like Zeus
Gimme a mic booth and outta both of my eyes light will shoot
The unorthodox report from the blocks
From who called the cops to who saw the drop
From who snorting rocks, who caught the plot
My linage is from God image, we wear turbans
But now meet me in person; I tatted 'The Virgin'",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-the-virgin-pt2-lyrics

In search deep in the mind
You'll find it funk always living the heart
You know what I mean?
Brainstorming till the ink change form
Doing it
(Killah Priest)
From black space to face of the deep
Passing cosmic lights, till our Earth spin beneath the passage
Till the funky cosmic rhythm, that lies up in our solar system
Now I unfold this wisdom
""If you suck my soul, I'll lick your funky emotions""
Sound's coming from these deep Omens
Tap upon my pineal glands
My third eye swift as the bird fly
The eagles did land
(Chorus) Priest X2
In Galaxies we meet, Aliens and Sheikh's
Kings in the streets wrapped in gold sheets
For one common 'cause we came for the beat
(Interlude) Priest
You know, somebody had to plant it
That's where we in, somebody planned it
Since we lived on the planet Earth
So it was a plan at first
(Chorus) Priest X2
(Interlude) Priest
I could see further then my eyes could look
(Killah Priest)
A new government swerving in my mother-ship across the globe
Pop out wearing a Sorcerer's robe
Musical keys flying out my sleeves, funkyfied the masses
Got Aliens pop, locking with Aztecs
Green afros, resemble the Astros
Tripping of an acid, my eyes turn purple like I took the tablet
Looking Lazarus, moon-walking from his coffin
Octopus on the corner talking

Do you see? Do you see?
Travel so far to get to the past
And I turned back and looked into the future

And the pad was without form, no writing

Day of the Prophets,Heavy Mentwo (Bootleg),1998,"Lookin' at the Earth filled with darkness
Through the windows I ?spot it?
Seein' the crimes, evil times, backslide
As the fornicators, investigators, scorners and haters
Adulteress, kids, sorcerers with witches
Snitches carvin' bitches, scars and stitches
Death threats, TECs, welfare checks and sex
It's my desire to see the Messiah return to burn the entire empire
From the Book of Zecheriah
Chapter 5 require you attack the map from the north
Behold the pale horse; the Earth force
Make way, run for your 12 gauge and your AK
Mayday, mayday, mayday, war parade in the USA
The White House masquerade, universal ray
Spiritual renegade, the street's a barricade
Death, grenades, blaze the anti-matter rays
Aims, blaze, New Age, hurricane, tidal wave of slaves
Follow the maze to the grave
Those who dis-obey now OBEY
Something satanic invades the planet, PANIC
Sun of Man versus the Uncle Sam
The lion of Judah meets the computer
Alert the sharpshooter for the intruders
Then send the weapons that were nuclear up to Jupiter
The new star will be LUCIFER
Global ?
The racism; the great wisdom of Malcolm X
I'm stressed on house arrest
The reunion at the Soviet Union is RUINED
Navy seals, babies killed, the scholar reveal the secrets of the dollar bill
New World Order, this is slaughter
As Sodom and Gomorrah, as the beast rise from the bottom of the water
Having 7 heads with plagues
The feds versus the dreads
Universal violence, I remain in silence to throw the enemy off the balance
I'm the good shepherd that protected the sheep form the leopard
The thugs push off their last minute drugs
Families get their final hugs, the marines jump in they submarines and get their machine-guns
No more Sun-light, the final fight
Bring forth your pitchforks and your pipes
And your shovels, rebels and the devils are now level
Bacteria becomes superior, Man becomes INFERIOR

In the day of the PROPHETS (x4)

Ghost in the cloud, smoke arise over the crowd
I heard the cries fill the skies after I revealed the lies
And the destruction of the sword ?
As the reaping of the unholy and the unjust thieve
The whore mongers wonder, thunder, lightning striking
It's frightening, the rain ?
The weak stand upon their feet in white sheets
Quite deep as the Earth tremble at the symbol of the seven and the twelve
Heaven and Hell, be well
War, missiles, nuclear missiles, disaster, burn up the pastor and the cross
The day of the PROPHET
The messengers of the apocalypse
From atop of the -apolis mountain
Slowly amountin', countin' seconds away from the final day
Man, woman, boy, girl begin to curl
It'll only last a minute once I'm in it to break the timid creature
The soul seeker
Give me yo 9 millimeter, I would not meet ya as a man
Isaiah 42 verse 13, scream, the sword sharpen, strokes
Across the throat, pokes then you cold
Business ?
? last croak
The day of the prophet, winter turns colder
The babies are dressed like soldiers in their strollers
The great sacrifice, the Anti-Christ, THE HEAVENS UNITE

The Great Seal (iTunes Bonus Track),Elizabeth,2009.0,"The dirt colored clouds spread wide across the skies
Over mouths that lie
And hover heads of evil thoughts, dead birds fly
Money, religions, pigeons walk in circles with their heads cutoff
A city with love lost, drugs across with Jesus with feet missing
Christians pray, call out of them graves
Listen, chapters, psalms, verse 1:49
All of us blind, look at shorty in crime
Pause, the years gave no reward, weep more
Souls restored, new face, say ya grace
Saints, mama faints at the wake
Electrical fence or a wedding cake?
The choices we make
Let the Church kneel and I stand up
The gun the shield his handcuff
The system stamped us, the TV brand us, cameras
His Holy Grail fell, fathers getting darker
Martyrs in hell, hotter, gangsters holler from shells
Hammers, hands, feet with nails to a dollar
Cold sell, all ya answers is backwards
What we hear for? What's our true name and culture?
Some seek salvation at the aim of a soldier
The rain gets colder, our reign's getting closer
Jehovah Witness without the Watchtower looking over
I'm a Brooklyn roller; I speak how I suppose to
The rifle on my shoulder.... BAH!!!
Judah Benjamin, Levi since knee high, we live Aruba night
Moonlight, goons bless you, Gesundheit
Corrupt government, erupt, disrupt coverage
Michael Jackson's assassin, had a tab from acid
Or tablets, still can't add to his classics
He wears a mask, now he's with the Arabs

God is - Yahuwah, revealing his plans
God is - Zechariah: 5, Verse: 9
God is - I see her face as I lift thine eyes

I took off the corruptible flesh, put on an indestructible vest
Loading Bible verses, playing Russian roulette wit death
The Devil's laughing with his lustful passion
He wants me in his Lake of Fire, dissolving like aspirins
6-6-6 cough medicine in the cabinet
Murder Lucifer, you can't move
What the lord has established, two semi-automatics
Two Torah tablets for the author of madness
I read Surah, to me his alter is a magnet
One might ask why did I choose Israel
It wasn't me, it was His will
Until it's revealed, my lips are permanently sealed
You think this government gonna save us? Nigga is you crazy?
You can't see them killing us lately?
God bless the Christian, I pray for the blind religion
Who can't see the time we living in the prisoners behind the system
(Chorus) Priest

Follow me to a world without envy and hate
Just a planet that twirls, infinity in space
In grave they swallow with death in Hell
And his preys is followed, wit breath in bells
On a garments of elders, kings and saints
And martyrs that stood with wings on a sink
And the thugs can smile as they walk up the isles
Wearing tattoos and bullet wounds, flesh backs of the trials
Galaxies of a calm peace
A pure light riding over the crew, storm beneath
A shadowy warm heat, embraces our face as it burns off our skull
We go deeper into space to a - great cosmic gate
Where his prophets wait, in there we will conversate
In the dawn, pours out a vase, in the waters of a grace
Where she says ""welcome to her twelve sons""

Spread peace and love, holdin' crucifixes and lighters
Outside wit the thieves and liers
Murder and hell stood by
Wavin' was the image of God
The Virgin begins to cry
Why mother, as she looks in the eyes of others
She said: ""It's not for him but my children who suffered""
We got to the burial plot, the bottomless pit
Where he was dropped along wit the apocalypse
We watched from the top of the cliff

You can't do nothin' positive
Twist ya fingers up and bang
And keep reppin', poverty, King's and fiery

Just do the knowledge, remind them
Sit down, their palms are red, I'm the Mystic
Black finger nails, blue lipstick
Who is this? You hear music in the background
You see backs and hear sounds, your trapped now
You see wolves and blood hounds
You the big bear in the hood and still a thug now
I'm turnin' the streets into graveyards
We lay them in cages, the eons left precise in clay jars
Put 'em in tombs with mummies, and foreign countries
Slept under the stars monthly, I'm starvin', hungry
I pray to God on one knee
Explodin' quasars confront me
In the heavens I'm one legend, peace to Genie
Many Shieks have seen me, many gypsies are misty
Present from the Pharoahs themselves
Share their myths in pyramids
Late wives bein' curious, my spirit lives
Forseen sectors from my ancestors
Burried beneath the sand treasures
You should know I'ma one legend

I inherit this jewel, never sit with a fool
Never eat with no booze, they'll poison ya food

In the ghettoes the Devil's painting is that of serpant
Who does he worship, better serve us or turn to dust
I bug out like I'm smokin' a bomb
I seen niggas in coat of arms
Vikings, Knights, Kings the sky's brightenin' from lightenin'
Angels give me white wings to fly away
In Heavens hotter ways, night turns to day
Back to darkness over the projects
The Indians fear and clap calm 'til they bodies dead
And wings come out their back bone and they flap home
Crack thrones with King's slumped bodies over

Pictures of niggas within the scriptures with the same style as me

But did they swing box cutters in gutters and blow trees in lobby's?
Nah, theres for Bethlehem puff the wild irish grand
Till he told him that his hours at hand
Fuck that my last suppers at Benny Hanna's
A strip club wit sick thugs throwin plenty dollars
Ice chain the Dice game wit the Semi Revolver
My passion is of the hood life, gangsters and killers
Niggas represent the struggle sayin Priest we feel ya'
These the Paintings of a Saints wings, the Lucifer horns
Shootouts and stabbings the youth is all gone ( feel me )

We get shit lifted niggas
Roll a spliff take a sip a the liquor
Spark the coke now I'm definately wit'cha
We get shit lifted nigga
I move through the smog of the city life
Blend with the grimy gritty type we make moves at night
Got a kite from my scrap he about to touch down
We spent a yard up north and walk the block in the town
Travel at the speed a sound
A moving target's hard to hit, thats why I keep it moving kid
Paint a picture without a brush I put my life on sketch
Every line is pain and my love is intricate
Drink liquor till the bottle hollow, Thankful to see tomorrow
Thankful to see my man we gotta continue the plans
Grands upon grands is what we trying to stack
And there ain't no turning back unless the guns pointed at me
Dog I caught a hole in my back
I guess thats payback for all the dirt I did in the past
I seen life pass before my eyes in a flash
I been caged up wishing I could be on the ave
I been in a dorm , wishing I could be in the lab
My loyalty is priceless, my heart is genuine
You gain a driving force if you got me as a friend
I blow ganja smoke in the air for all my dead kin
And I vow till my boy pow wow will win

Fresh out the dugout watch the picture begin
On the mound striking em out, snipen em out
All the new birds you heard how I'm pipen em out?

Once the head spit, dust off my prints
Bullet wounds left more than an inch
Six in him and four in his bitch
Ya'll should just stop and just call it quits
Only gonna end up in the morgue or the ditch
When I start rhyming, put my all in it

One clip, take a nigga to the exit
Pray that he meet death quick
Poison body like asbestos
Shot him when the tech spit

So what ya'll want, dog, what's the deal?
I ain't got, nothin' for ya'll, but lots of steel
I ain't, runnin' from ya'll got shots to peel

Pump shit the opposite of what you feel, fuck what you say
Wanna see me trapped (uh-huh), fucked in the game (okay)
Locked up in the pen, or, caught by the flames
Nah, caught up by the same thing, Glock to your brain chain

Clap ya'll rappers to the point of extinction

And hell is slow, puffin' out your nose
Creatin' fogs of old school flicks, I do this for kids
My music, my gift, broken ghettos and harsh reality
Made me thorough, my art gallery, nine uncles
I flunked school, robbin', rope chains, the street have no name
Fiends that preach the dope game
Deep like the blood of my nephew, soaked in the streets
I heard it scream through the concrete, rest in peace
This last release, the flesh that eat, want me
The pen comes to me, I open my books, like scrolls of Moses
I look, I see skulls and ghosts
I shook, the Bible, I wrote it with hooks, come on


The pen, the pad, the friends I had
To the live it ends in vag', it's like grin to a laugh
To wild outrageous, and then I'm mad
To a face that show expression, depression, begin to look sad
The tears come out, it's weird, I dumb out, pretend to be glad
Cigarette on my lips, I don't even smoke
I leave that to Kruger, I gotta stay afloat
Watch the way we maneuver
Peace to Tutta, held me down in Cali
I see the future, flee from troopers
Revolutionary blood, sweat and tears, obsessin' with fears
Paranoia, got me needing more lawyers
Got me reachin' for guns, see I'm comin' for ya
Hold up, I stargaze, into God's face
Embrace Allah's grace, sun and moon, star gates
Space, is my place of birth, made my way into the Earth
Came to the lunars of kings, held coins with wings, come on


I gave ya'll, all of my Views of Masada, the drama

A rap athormesis, but that got restarted
So I Revisit ya'll, with more of the God, that roar in they heart
Yo, Priest, you still hustle, Priest, you still struggle
Priest, you still bubble, them streets is still trouble
Them thieves will cuff you, lock you up in pens with men
That couple, friends will cut you
Poor education, the ghetto is hell
Heaven is Park Ave., the system is jail, religion wears a dark mask
Worn by faces, wind up in newspapers
A true gangsta, til the wheels fall off and the gats is on E
Two gats is on me

Y’all wanna be the GOAT, I’ll be the wolf dressed up in sheep clothing when it’s time for hunting lamb
Last time I won a Ram
The street was starving to market a new artist from the projects was my hunger plan
80s was the number man
Teena Marie “Square Biz” was my summer jam
God body, hard rocks and block parties, y’all just don’t understand
It was jackets by Farmers and leather bombers and boots with the lumber brand
If you was Spanish or Italian it was Far Rockaway or Coney Island if you want a tan
The beach was the holy water
The New York of Rich Porter, Robert Walker, Latin Quarter's, Manhattan lawyers
Staton right across the waters, shooters and slaughters
Brooklyn fiends, Bronx, Queens, beans by Goya
I used to dream I was the voyager and beam beyond the borders
Rap was my hypnosis, I noticed my lids closing then opening moment
Flowing, I’m going, I’m going then finally gone
Feeling myself coming back when I yawn
Reciting the book of Psalms
Practicing the Tibetan burning palm, black dragon fist
Hiram Abiff, I am the myth, the labyrinth, black man from Nazareth, implanted wrists
Sacred land of Atlantis was where hands on the canvas
It’s like ancient Sanskrit, then I vanish
Control the planets

What’s the word of the renown?
Render your opponent helpless and at your mercy
The elders of eternity, the welders of mercury
In my father’s shelter there’s many universities
Within a potted cellar, there’s plenty of nurseries
Time is not to waste
And don’t be an astronaut to take up space
And never interrupt your enemy while he’s making a mistake
Because volatile words is like a double edged sword
And victory is when your opponent surrender on his own accord
Just like the proverbs as a solving Viking
It’s best to win a war without fighting
And it’s better to read a person’s thoughts without writing
Can you feel the force without trying?
Can you heal from loss without crying?
As I reveal the courts transport from the Mayans
Interview within myself, have a talk like O’Brien
Pull up a chair, sit down and open up about the Orion
In a system of the stars with bars I’m reciting
But I’d rather talk about the makings of us
Love, bouquet of flowers, summer showers and winter’s cusp
Spring coming and going in autumn winds
Lunch with friends
Watching a bird bath where the sparrow cleanse
A heart-shaped box covered with opal  button barrel gems
It’s all coming into view
I’m comfortable when I’m talking about…

And Officer Murphy always told me on the ground and in the century
There's a whole lots of gangstas
The huslters and the playas
This is the hood where I came up
Look around ain't shit changed much
We all in the struggle wit the same luck
Lemme get some of that aimed at ya puff
The new cup of brown now ain't tough
My big homie Tank said watch me call his bluff

We gotta do somethin'
I mean I'm tired the way they treatin' our women
Women tired of the way we treatin' our men
Gotta a good job now and you ain't fuckin' wit him
Cuz of yo black ass that's why he's up in the pen
He was there for you and all you had to do was be loyal
Instead you let the lies' of boss spoil
No morals, so awful and unlawful
And I'm sincere when I said I spilled the tears
For real niggas that ball
Cuz of dudes who act like broads
They pretend they're real but really frauds
Light up another philly dawg
Let me kick it wit y'all
A double minded man is unstable in most of his ways
It hosts in the grave, it ghost in the cage
He stores most of his rage, hides it wit a smile
But on the inside he frowns
Waitin' for ya luck to go down
You clowns, you workers of evil deeds
Children of mischief, coulda had a blessing but you missed it
It's so unrealistic, come feel lyrics
My tongue heals spirits wit the realness
And to you dead-beat fathers that wanna be street martyrs
Straighten up ya posture
You're not worth the streaks of my marker

Up the block was the park and the subway train
We party every Friday ’til Sunday came
Then it was church, go in my pocket, here’s a bunch of change
There’s sister Johnson giving unusual  range
She limped in, sat down after she hung up her cane
But my mind was on block parties and the summer games
As the choir sang to the organ, a drummer banged
The preacher had us baptized, but we backslide
Born black with pride, afros high as The Jackson 5
Life here was no picket fence and apple pie
People relying on just enough cash to survive
Projects, the acronym we visualize
Projects, where drug dealers and criminals hide
The object, to keep us minimized
The process, remove fathers from mothers and children lives
I know a Blood who’s sick but can’t see the word “Crip” in the word prescription
I know a Crip with high blood pressure, too much of salt he committed
Now do we bang on each other, or do we bang on our symptoms?
Too much processed beef
Is it artificial sweet? We hypertension
The sickness, we need to fix it
Water to flush our system
Keep us from the morgue and out their prison
Stay off the hog and the chitlins
Hot Fries, Popeyes, where are they getting all of these chickens?
Turkey jive, Five Guys, it’s  of addiction
To the place where our hopes and dreams try to fly like birds with broken wings
That’s why we smoke herb for our dopamines

Snuck behind it slowly,  a spear
Young rabbits unaware once the summer is near

Only mystics come here

Broken terrains of cliffs
Outcrops and ravines
Streams filled with fish
Quiet nights and quiet light
There’s movement
The moon lit

Before I grabbed the wheel and peel, pushed the stick and drive
Check my steel and slide my gun to the side
Lightning is cut and thru the dark skies
Spell and revenge there's hell in my lens
No bumps, black goose fly outta my skin
Teeth pullin' on black gloves over my hand
Tryna hold on to the wheel while I'm drivin'
Only emitted before I reach this Island
So sick I'm smilin'
This gon' end in violence
I taste redemption in the air
That I seasoned wit time
Watch it simmer in the mind
I cool it wit off wit the nine
Better yet I got the M82A1, a sniper's gun
This should be fun
See tomorrow he plans to speak before the Congress
About an Underworld conglomerates
He plans to hold a conference to introduce the microchip
But I got the contract to leave 'em stiff
They ordered to hit

A hit on the Rothschilds
A contract on the DuMonts
The Machiavellian lost files
I want judges, presidents laid down
Before the Order of the New World goes around
There's this house, I wonder where his whereabouts
I circle around this crib like in the form of brewin'
Windows down for the shootin'
Black shades for the viewin'
Roll ova by a tree then no one can see me
Binoculars around my neck
I sense death and tits in every breath
Murder steps, I see a light come on
Cross you, so nothin' goes wrong
I see a head come in the room
It's a lady holdin' a baby
Mouth open, stick out my tongue
Tasted air like I'm so crazy
Then he walks in caution
Walks over looks out his window like he knows
I talk to myself real slow
He's lookin' deep into the trees like he see me

How I Write, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"When I’m all alone, my chair is a throne
My desk is ruins found from Soviet Union, made of marble and stone
My hat is a crown
Finally my destiny’s found
My journey begins
Pick up my pen
Like a brush, start to scuff art galleries and galaxies
Once my pallet is squeezed, the pilot can see
My crown now grows great wings
The music sound is a breeze
I begin to lift off like a king on the back of a dragon
Anything I imagine can be seen in my graphics
Tablets of magic
Telepathic at the dawn of the Sabbath
When I write, Mount Sinai lifts up to the heavens
God passes judgement
The gathering of the brothers
My mathematics emanate lights from the mysteries of divine thought
Seven hundred new Torahs go forth
If I give them the Quran, show them the hand of beyond
From lightyears to eons
In space there’s a great mountain where all the dead climb, tryna make it to the top before the  tiger gouge ‘em
Beyond that, invisible castles where all the pharaohs and all the Mayans talking and dining
And Malcolm X walks in with Medgar Evers, whispers to King
Nat Turner and Harriet Tubman are seen
And Obama’s grandmother is busting, yelling at everybody, “We have our first black president!”
The heavens commence to party, acting up, standing on tables, dancing
Marcus Garvey holding up by Molly
I see the sinister smile of Haile Selassie
I begin to write more and more
My mind was sore
I can see the , given the , the  and the , the , the divine order
My mind’s aura
My body swims across the cosmic waters
Dividing night from the day
Calling the moon from out of the grave
We were a nation before we were slaves
Remember that
This is how I write
Write
This is how I write
This is how I write
Through a ball needle, I can see all people
Absorb  like a cosmic eagle
Landed on the sharp surface
Many things to interpret
The mind is perfect
One of god’s greatest designs
Since the dark gray curtains that hang through the seven thousand universes
How I write is like day turning to night
From beige to light
From the grave to a life
From a babe to those pipes
From rock showers to media storms
From watch tower, my graffiti is formed
I sit with the cosmic Egypts
Nefertiti on my arms
I write with the whole city in my palms
I give you an updated song of psalms of King David arriving on a spaceship
Scribes try to trace it, scribble, erase it
I show you how far I can take it
Beyond Mars to places that’s sacred
To other languages of ancient shit that  prints
The vegetables came and went
Celestial
Through concentration, I can see the constellation
This my revelation
This is how I write
This is how I write
This is how I write

This is how I write
This is how I write",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-how-i-write-lyrics

Got projects after projects, not even the Feds look
If it's Crown Heights, stand around lights

They wear black apparel, the streets are black and narrow
This go for all Brooklyn underworld allegience
Who by night gather up their teams and

Whose direction, fools love affection, Vaccine goo injections

Carol with a white pimp, took a sniff of nose candy
Eyes low hoe said those are family
And said she’s chasing the 38 worlds the lord promised her
A lost black girl posing in front of the photographer
Could have been the one in front of the teleprompter
Or exploring our world from helicopters
Now she’s under the care of medical doctors
Savior day saints, latter of prayers, gangster give thanks
Got ‘em out of them stairs, which way is paradise?
The shooter gave him bad advice
A drug user grab the pipes, let his steam dream the promised land
Abandoned angels with harps in their hands
The blind deception of man ‘cause when them drugs go away
He’s still hugging them graves, you’re still rubbing those grays
On your beard, asking God why you’re still here
Your hand print in vomit and beer
Shedding tears ’til they siphon from off your beard
Daddy’s home, come here
Word sincere, my man built on this paragraph
By seeing the spacecraft pass over the city like God’s hand

Quantum leap with Roman and Moses
Farrakhan speak, a nation that’s the chosen
President’s impeached, he faces the omens
Divine radiance, a pillar of clouds
The streets is the craziest, a killer brought down
Shooting wild, ladies hit, “That dude is a clown”
My man said wiping off the baby shit, ""What we do now?""
Abraham never died, it’s about grand entrance and birthright
We lost tribes, double 9s
Bullet proof vests and a cup of wine
I got the word from father divine, the smartest shall shine
The ghetto’s a picture painted by an artist who’s blind
Provocative rhymes, me and Pac is in line
I’m David’s heart and Jesus’ flesh and Solomon’s spine
My conscience is accomplice to the secrets of the redeemer
The coffin of Joseph, Imhotep
In depth, come and sit with my soldiers

I’m a conversator with government crooks, clean brothers with bad looks
Street philosophers, readers of Jacob books
Don’t hang around gossipers, but niggas who can tell if you shook, ghetto patriarch
The rap thought X7, he break ‘em apart, he sniping their marks
Heard he was a sergeant, silent bullets placed in his heart
Night goggles while they’re sniping up hollows
Better tomorrow, ghetto apostle
Saw the Devil tryna steal god souls
Dark flows show you ghostly as he's embraced the hands of the presence
Pleasant priest, divine king or shepherd
My homie rest his head on Solomon sentence
Woke up the next day, sparked the L and spoke in godly dimensions

Fur coats, herb smoke, drop the ashes
Play the curb, show the fashion
’88, Scarface tapes
All my apes caught a case, fought the jakes
Doing quarters in the gates due to slaughtering the snakes
The water’s full of hate
Microphone life alone to write his own
Inside the poem Bible’s known
I gather bones of Picasso, broke ‘em up in the bowl
Stole the skeleton of Shakespeare and Da Vinci’s skull
Placed them in the mix then grinded it to a liquor
Drunk it down while spit  pictures
Listeners, I turn your dome to theaters
The realest niggas appeal to killers
My brain’s haunted
I got a conscious full of convicts
Inside my brain cell as well I hold my conference

Salute, niggas, I got my finger on the trigger
This the life of antichrist, ice and dark liquors
With no mixtures
Knowing soldiers with you when I hold the pistol
’til God blow the whistle, so official
Salute, niggas, I got my finger on the trigger
This the life of antichrist, ice and dark liquors
With no mixtures
Know a soldier with you when I hold the pistol
’til God blow the whistle, I’m so official

So salute

Priest logic, deep conscious, heat launchers
Street rockets be cosmic
Seek comets
Hit the project, release hostage from beast market
Go ahead and chant, ’til you see an avalanche hit the doors of battle rams
Say my name across the apple lands
The MAC in my hand
But lose a firework, write a verse, messiah search
We flood the streets while they die of thirst
Your OG wanna light his purp, pull on the trees then he pause
Shut his eyes, blow the weed from his jaws
Opened his eyes then he reads, “The world is yours”

Suckers, see you on tour
And all you rappers, believe me it’s war
I’ve seen the sun at night and owls in the daytime
The stars align, God state of mind

Stack your paper lowkey, enjoy the wonders and grace
Words spoken of a hustler now buried a saint
‘cause at the end there’s salvation for all of my men
Crucified in the streets and resurrect in the pen
We cringe at tone of the beef, sacrifice for our sins
’til we rise from the corner after life then begins
Bullets take the shape of hood silver wolves
It ain’t living no more
Come outside then it’s pistols at jaws
Lord is my shepherd
Crack fiends running  for more
The drug lords measured and supplied through the lobbies and halls

In this world that we know, only one time to go
Diamonds glow
The sun help us dig out 
We make big holes
We fail at the end of our soul
Scuff and scrap only to shine brighter as gold

So was god’s plans raised in these streets, a harsh land
Survived the ‘80s sweep system and Jeeps and park jams
Garage bands, Duran Duran, save a player, gangsters’ll stare at funerals with tattered ink as his tears
The youth believe in godfathers
Suspicion grab the wrist of the barber
Any snake you with, the fish at the harbor
Grip revolvers, official armor, spit the llamas
The devil ganja blunt lit up the drama
At his wake he lay stiff, kiss his cheek in his honor
Drug merchants, perfect serpent spirit
Jesus Christ the only son and God is one
Two thousand worlds I spit from my tongue
The word was made flesh and manifest me
Holding a tech, show some respect
Poison bitch killed the connect
HIV had him erect, had him for sex
Black suit, hats and veils, it’s Kill Bill style
She buried him and smiled

In this world that we know, only one time to go
Diamonds glow
The sun help us dig out 
We make big holes
We fail at the end of our soul
Scuff and scrap only to shine brighter as gold

The Holy Grail was really Christ and Mary Magdalene’s baby girl
They all sprang, moved to the other side of the world
Quickly advanced to France, became the Merovingians, desert people like the Palestinians
Sumerian texts spoke like the Abyssinians
Yeah, try and cross me like Chris Columbus did the Indians
That’s white devilishment, black president, crime elements
Crack atoms, rhymes come together like matter
Solid to gases, I spit a whole new universe will scatter
Astro shower, astro powers
Every verse is a starburst
My light shines brighter than the sun
When I go outside, I grow flowers
Hubble Space Telescope thug in a spiral galaxy
In cyber hell we blow slug virtual reality
Like the Jetsons, cyborg cops seal off our sections
Grab our weapons for protections

In this world that we know, only one time to go
Diamonds glow
The sun help us dig out 
We make big holes
We fail at the end of our soul
Scuff and scrap only to shine brighter as gold",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-golden-calf-lyrics
Fortune Teller, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Armani jet suits, floating the coop, soldiers salute
King of BK, be brave or cobras will shoot
Drug habits, automatics,  the casket
Six feet deep, eternal sleep, the cause of reaction
They want revenge, last cry haunts his friend
Long ride to the other side through the fog with winds
Where many of the street legends meet in the essence
Over beef, lord, deceased ’til there’s holes in the heaven
Then they stand in the mid world
That’s purgatory but murders before the glory
Angels heard they told their stories
City of immortality, seen by a gypsy
Portal through the galaxies, pity morality
Then what have we learned?
Kings before us scream as they burn
And firewaters tryna warn us while we take we return
We were fools
We pray to the sun for our jewels
Plenty women, dominions, inhibition of rules
For we were carnal, used to argue over worldly riches
Warn our children, they suffer like early witches
They took gold from off our skeletons
As our soul took hold of the seraphims
The scrolls unfold to element
Our eyes wide closed to show intelligence
To sit on thrones of devilishment

I’m your fortune teller
Walk under Walter’s shelter
Sit for a spell, have some brew
Hand me that Rooster and bring me that Kabbalah too
I’m your fortune teller
Walk under Walter’s shelter
Sit for a spell, have some brew
Hand me that Rooster and bring me that Kabbalah too

The wheel of time, it turns, around the ages like a pavement, laid by memory’s terms
Long or short, what we do, born or bought, right or wrong
We depend on thoughts to be retaught
History made some men legends
But legends fade into a grave and those  back here today
Is it reincarnation or retardation?
Should we reach our god or reach our nation?
Should we read the stars or feed starvation?
The fortune teller sees the cards, which way they’re facing
And once in a while, the clouds of chance will overshadow the plans of man, forecast our poor past again
Like King Edward of Woodstock
 on hood blocks
From predators from the Brook-lock
Fellas that took shots and ambushed 
From drug cartels in Mexico with a steady flow
But there are still kidnappings, entrapments and drug trafficking, blood splashing
My crystal blackens

I’m your fortune teller
Walk under Walter’s shelter
Sit for a spell, have some brew
Hand me that Rooster and bring me that Kabbalah too
I’m your fortune teller
Walk under Walter’s shelter
Sit for a spell, have some brew
Hand me that Rooster and bring me that Kabbalah too",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-fortune-teller-lyrics

The Queen of England found a new land
The birth of New York, ’til they let the nukes off
American flags and army fatigues, suits in the Gulf
It’s for the poor out in Ecuador, all the way to the 
They both had pyramids mysterious
Bolivian cartels, to the coverup of Roswell
African tribes, face covered with flies
The news full of lies
They got coverage of live gangsters buried alive
American pie is now Dubai
A few fly
The rich conversate over butterfly eggs and roasted  hearts
We shoot AKs here on the coast with villains 
The Lord’s healing the heart
The reverend tells the pew while placing his hands on the prostitute while watching her boobs
A DA begins to prosecute a box full of youth
Somewhere you hear, “Freeze,” then the cops will shoot
Salt water pools, church  for fools
Here’s the clues, let me walk you through
When you pray, you talk to god
When you meditate, god talks to you
You seem confused
We live in Revelations
Head of the nation is Satan
Conjugation, conquered races
Now we facing condemnation
I’m contemplating confrontation
Final bomb invasion
We psalms in waiting

When Moses was born, the clouds in the skies parted
When Jesus was born, everything grew figs in the forest
Muhammad was born, the stars aligned
From words, looked Islamic
Priest was born, all the water turned chocolate
Born metropolis, it’s obvious
The Ds wanna cop our wrist, from the third planet from the sun
Hammers near their lungs
Cameras in the slums
I make a canvas from the eardrum
Spit with sincere tongue
Seven wonders in the world but I share with you nine
Bear with my mind to flower patience prepared this rhyme
From clay bodies laying lifeless to second breath blown inside of Isis
Wisdom in the  to  to  to 
Check the gems I wrote
My pen strokes artifact photography rap
The pen in my hand is a spray paint can
The thoughts is a white subway train flooded with game
My ink makes stains
Glasses of Shakespearian’s experience

Nazareth, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"I spit that purple spaceship, that pink elves inside a polka dot forest, that orange and yellow ape shit
That big blue building with tiny green doors, fiends on the floor, knocking and shocking, begging for change
My letter take aim, blow ‘em out of the frame
I spread it deranged, scatter your brain
Animal exchange
Seductive bullets that sunk in the heart of a husband
Stunning, the art of the woman
The wife tell detectives
She starts crying, she lying
Laughing inside, that passion, he died
Spying while dining, reclining
Drano inside of his soup, witch’s brew
The bitches knew the witness’s clue the mistresses use
Lee Harvey Oswald to John Wilkes Booth
The secrets of Roswell, six men in 
The gravedigger, grim reaper, the gatekeeper, red crosses
A stake with snake features
Behold the pale portrait
A teardrop of blood from the virgin’s face
Priest the mystic pharaoh splurging in space

The legend has it his neck and his arms are tattered
He’s raptured, he’s back, he spits classic
He’s Nazareth
The legend has it his neck and his arms are tattered
He’s raptured, he’s back, he spits classic

Is heaven or hell sacrifices  impale
Skull hammers crossbone nails brimstone hells
Down upon the ghetto corners
Angel, devils, prophets’ll warn us
Shots come swarming to swatch with they warrants
Life and death, a righteous respects
Ds highlight my steps
Walk through the mystic bookstores
See them cover the walls in stain glass paintings
Amazing man invasion
Suspended animation
Tremendous canvas paintings
Cut off the head of the grand masons
Thirty third president stands as Satan
It’s all blatant
Watching cartoons, Dragon Ball Z ’til I doze off
Hand on a cup of Grey Goose
Shuffle out the tarot cards

Love Is Life, The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Yo, this starts like the opening scene of Claudine
Fort Greene,  Street fiends crowd the clinic for morphine
Lost dreams, the open credits start with kids with the  beverage
Five Percent lessons
Old school dudes smoking hectic
Love is the message
Marking the hands of the medics
Suffer from seizures
Black exploitation films play the features
Cooley High
I’m eight rubbing Judy thighs
That’s my babysitter
, bomber ski hats, my ’80 pictures
My sister yelling, “You a lazy nigga!”
Call me a brat
Four in the pack
My elder sister got pregnant at 18
My cousin Chucky in state greens
I’m counting  in my dreams
Visit by the social worker
Grandma said, “You supposed to worship”
Marks spark when we close to murder
You smile, show me first burner
Reaganology, the senior Bushonomics
 stop pushing chronic
The heroin atomic
The Clintonology
The W. Bush astrology
The stars , they’re all lies to me
The road to hell’s paved with good intentions
The highway to heaven is the rail of a hood relentless
Pay the preacher when I’m gone
Pay the principal at my prom
Pay the bail if I carry arms
Pay the lawyer if I let it 
Pay a teacher if my head is strong
Pay a coach if I catch a ball
Enoch was not transformed to Metatron
God gave ‘em the earth ’til the heavens 
Who gave us the dirt? The reverend 
Who gave us the hurt? The debt is gone
Who gave us the verse? He read it strong
Led by a hearse into heaven’s arms
Marcus, I miss you
Here’s a tissue
Tear drops turning crystals

Love is life, is life
Life is love, life is love
Love is life
And life is love
Life is love
Life is love

Yo, the clouds shape into a dragon
Dragon blows up nine planets
The planets represent my mind canvas
My mind canvas painted by a clown of madness
Blood stains of a gangster’s pain, the graphics
Fathers and addicts
Undercovers charge us with badges
See who largest on the campus 
Granted when go ‘head
The satellites scope us with cameras
Cats selling drugs
Grab the gat, ducking from a hail of slugs
Four deep tatters the realest thugs
Puffing weed, blowing tornados of greed
See the world what you niggas foresee
It’s hard to proceed
Next thing you know you have grays in your goatee
Young dudes call you OG
All your niggas pass on, you only see them in your dreams
Found out your man real name through the eulogy
His son spoke beautifully
No one rep the crew like me
You play the wall where new shorties smack handballs
Try to play the lobby where soon the janitor be cleaning probably
Try to play the front of your building
School bus waiting for little children
Try to hang in your old spot but now it’s a pizza shop
You try your old hideout but it’s a movie theater
Yo, shit’s getting realer
Time is changed
Time for change
Nothing ever stays the same

My past and my present
My name is Priesthood
Is it too televised for you?
Is it too real for you?

Domination, world population
Keep me runnin' while I'm gunnin' at Satan
Arms open wide
Please, Lord, let me fly
Give me answers to the when, where, how, and why
To questions we asked, back of my school class
I know I'm not a fool raised by my cool dad
Then he passed, started cuttin', smokin' hash
Hangin' out late

Damn, I was an I'll shorty!
Thinking of the years
That my peers was here before me
Court cases, buying beer by the 40
Getting scary thoughts
When I'm playing with my Legos
Stacking pieces, I build 'em like a cage yo

Is it my cage I'm in?
Is it the rage I'm in?
Why they degrade my skin?
This way I pray Amen
I say my prayer while I'm looking at the guns flare
A victim fall while the innocent young stares

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Don't blame it on the hood times
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Blame it on the PJs
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
In the lab thinkin'
Hennessy drinkin'
Play with my ink pen
Rhymes start to sink in
I'll thoughts
My own hood may be my cross
Police, my crown of thorns
Same child y'all pounded on
Sirens swarms
Nightsticks
A pipe lit
On the roof, ice picks
And the white chicks
Someone shoots, this whole world is crazy
As the herb smoke swirl, I'm hazy
Can't let the devil get the best of me
This ghetto's not my legacy
The planet is
My middle finger to the flag with my bandaged ribs
The other click on a mag
It's Montana, bitch!

You gotta see the PJs for what it is
Just hood parables
Good times
And life and what we know
The world is what we know
It's like

Moving slow

Melting angelic or hell pens I lock myself in
Y’all get it, vivid, think ribbons
Falling from the sky that’s velvet, the L lit
Dipped with dust, take a puff
See the relics

Submerged like shellfish in the ocean of youth

I jump off the roof

Back to the 15 straps from revolution

It's backs to cufeys on black's for retribution
It’s back to the consciousness of rap and good music
I heard Hip Hop was dead, I showed up for the viewing
Said the ulogy, kept my things for the students
My album's gonna have '97's influence
Psych mothersfuckers that offers an evolution

In Secret Anticipation,Rocket To Nebula,2020.0,"Above the diaspora of Africa
Aboard a craft sits 143,999 passengers, I was the last of ‘em
But in its true diameter, it can fit the whole population of Canada, alongside with half of Panama
We landed far on a place called the Atlantis star
We deboarded, we see forests, we see deep waters, beneath the orbits, unbelievable, gorgeous
It had diverse woodlands, ponds, lakes and brooks encaved inside of an amethyst cushions
Then appeared what looked like bushmen coming from around these sort of old trees
The closer they came, the more their faces looked more and more holy
They approached me, pointed slowly to the well developed ground that instantly became a mound
At the same time, their trees made this incredible sound
Their grass looked clear as glass with  layers, citron rug prayers, above was glaciers, around us was acres
And these people called themselves the saviors
Amongst their cliffs, crags and rocky mountainsides, we the Anunnaki island guides
They said, “Well done, welcome, the floors is just a million miles up high, and you are standing on top of the sky”
They said, “We will take you up by standing on a telepad”
It was hella fast, no craft, no path, we were just there in a flash
They said, “Welcome to our place”
I saw  at the base, all the way to the dining area
It was filled with ruins and blueprints and diamonds they gave to Sumeria
They said, “Welcome to the Nebula, where the impossible is regular, we are part of the alpha and omega bloodline and this is the house of the senators, before the BC settlers, we are the pyramid creditors, we planted the cacao, but then they worship us as the cow, the fish and the fowl, the cat and the owl”
They said, “We came to the crowd and ascended up in clouds, they printed us in the Dow and the Tao, rebelled with the tribes in Kenya called the Mau Maus or the natives in Virginia during the pow wow, kosher food and halal, black child along the Nile, the Yahawashi trial, the UFO files put you with us now, the place where isotope teleportation is allowed
Their profile was a Western old style
They had platinum hair with gold brows
They were robed down with no smiles
They move like laser lights when you’re tryna hold a steel to a wall and all the lights are off and while you’re holding the laser, you cough
They are the force, they turn disobeyers into a pillar of salt
And they have inventions still in the vault, it gets real as you thought
The alchemists, they turn steel into quartz
Inside the raindrops they place  in the quarks
The etherean gods from the halls of the crystal courts
The judges sit on the mothership that turns colors like a cuttlefish for those who discover it
“We created the covenant, we are the higher government, the spiritual Republicans, the prophets were our publicists”
And to open up their eyes and behold another disc
Shape-shining flying object, two became eighteen as the other split, and eighteen became forty after a couple more shifts
Then there sat a green shuttle in the mist
All of this the air ruffled but the sound had a muffled pitch
Then the craft on the lower and the upper switched
And their people were controlling it all by doing a subtle twitch
I mean the brother was quick
It hovered then “blip, blip, blip, blip”
I said, “Wait, are we going backwards or forwards? Eastern or western? Are we taking a northern or a southern trip?
He said, “In this place, it doesn’t exist”
Now zoom into the light on that mothership, now zoom back out as you puffing a spliff, getting a buzz from one hit, frozen stiff with a blunt on your lip and drugs in the dish
You at a reggae club with a chick, rubbing her hips
You got nugs of that piff
I submit at the summit above the cliff of that which cometh and that which goeth
No man know of the day nor the hour
Purple orbs empower me as I absorb the flower, and it’s all devoured, they as tall as towers
The fog, the showers
“It may be possible, but it’s too difficult,” always said by these beings called the doubters
“It may be difficult, but it’s possible,” always said by these beings called the routers
Then came these beings of kings and queens called the strouders that wore a cloak of smoke and sparkles gleamed from their trousers
They spoke louder and more prouder, calling the other gods cowards, while the Elohim scoured
Was this from prescription over counter? Or my visions of a close encounter?",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-in-secret-anticipation-lyrics

And feelers searching the block on who got rocks
They know who got shot and who got knocked, cruise with the cops
Mean mugging, teens, young’uns in front of they buildings where the fiends come in
They cease hustling
Street struggling
It rains with god tears for six long years
It’s crazy, they puttin’ hits on their peers
Fiery wave go through the ghetto

What causes earthquakes? Clips assortments

Somebody’s beginning to shank you
But them angels save you
You thankful

Murdering and lying demons
Filthy spirits, the reverend try to clean ‘em
Underworld is czars and bosses
Cigars are torch lit beneath the portrait
There’s black cars and Porsches
The lost tribes in the wilderness of North America
Ancestors cross that area
More the merrier
More the scarier
Where the mob will bury ya
Goons and terriers
Devil’s disciples with crosses and fork symbols and emeralds that resemble the grand large temples of templates of  of Scottish rights
Gothic likes hang over the stone streaks where there creeps a drone priest
Chrome meets conflicts
The cons click

Raincoat, called his conglomerates
Train smoke right above the monument
He had the documents
Eyepatch, a wise cat lie back and peep it
Check the secret
Now he’s blindfolded, on the bridge, 9’s open and blew his wig
Before he died he took out five soldiers
Crime’s over, detectives got his dental records from his rental wreckage
A Lexus is hectic
I guess they wanna send a message
Dirty work of the devil’s shepherd
Desperate
Yellow tape below the bridge around the lake
Ghetto state
These are the breaks
Black and white seeds are murdered
No traces of the killer’s burner
What’s even further, the streets is filled with unsolved mysteries
Once triggers squeeze, it’s meat freezers or a dirty river or the cleaver
It’s pimps, money, lust and divas

One destiny, one dynasty, one king
Drivin', starrin' at the horizon
Glarin', compare me to Orion
More like Osiris, two sided, like the Gemini
But it's Priest the Lion
The Leo, Cleo, psychic, I get deep with this rhymin'
Writin', so many people tried to deny 'em
But he keeps climbin'
Yo, my man hung his phrase up in the air
It said ""PWOWR"" caught his words let it sit in my ear
For days, many hours
While in the shower, the heat fog up the mirror
Water drip to a letters, it couldn't be clearer
It spelled: P.W.O.W.R
I saw my face in black space around couple of stars
Come drink the wine of my realness
From the cup of the Gods
Or eat the grapes of my wrath, blood from my bars
My man lit up the haze
The gray smoke showed us the end of days
Hip-Hop's in a dead state, I bet it come out of them graves
The Psychic World of me, it's not a PG
It's the autobiography of the unknown hottest emcee
Neva get noticed, that's why the double is approachin'
Y'all in trouble, the due date's closin'
Give back my style, let go of my flow
Come out of my king's robe, leave my kingdom
There's a difference between me and them and me and him
It's Priest amongst the immortal men
Prepare nigga, 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'
It's difference between me and them
'Psychic World of Walter Reed' nigga comin' soon",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-psychic-priestyles-lyrics
Mermaid,Rocket To Nebula,2020.0,"After I burn sage, I follow the mermaid through the worm cage
In a turn of an age, but I can’t discern the days
I’m in a daze, unconcerning of phase
A stage as I follow her through this maze
Coming up out of the etherean waves with a filthy bathe right below the milky ways
She turned and  me with a quilt she made out of silk and suede
Suddenly I’m in middle grade
Then staring into a mirror, gazing at her head that’s fully braid
Face wooly with little grays
Then she took me through this underwater path through these hills that she 
Then through a chilly haze over many graves
I felt silly, this feels really crazed
Underwater castles where the guards of an ancient city stayed
I felt trippy, I felt dizzy, it’s misty
I felt that I have any legs
Is this astral projection or out of body experience or some kind of godly deliverance?
Sorry, pardon my ignorance
Or are we prohibited from  remembrance? Cognitive dissonance
The marsh shows discipline
My bars show the penmanship, penmanship to brilliantness
Brilliantness to the wilderness for a pilgrimage where the healing is
Found the electron plasma
Snatched a leaf from out of jasper
In disbelief, turned into gold then closed my palms, when I released, it turned into amber
I’m onboard a rocket ship where the chairs are detailed with chakra strips
Below us, the apocalypse
Before us, a metropolis
Her fabric must have been made out of magic, I wore it like a jacket
I felt like I was going backwards, this is madness
Then she opened up another tablet that gave me access to the address of the masters
I accept the journey like Paul on his way to Damascus
Or like Jesus to Mount Olive, they both rode in on asses
So I’m doing alchemy sitting beneath the olive tree
Now standing on the balcony studying the astrology, wearing an orange robe, a white man bun, rocking molly beads
Enlightened being, a knighted king
My whole studio’s made of crystal, I wear a cape, my mic is wing
Wordplay supreme, I follow the mermaid queen

She told me many things, showed me another range, the lower and the upper planes
Inner body or outer body, I can’t explain
But I just couldn’t understand something, the demands of this woman
A fish, what was her wish? Do we exist?
I tried to resist, she insist, then we kissed, then my mind went “blick,” this is it
It’s more than just a void, the darkness, the process, the odd guess
Some will get , yes
I remember images, things I recollect
But to put in retrospect, I didn’t wear a vest
And it’s not the long sleep that comes when you succumb to the numb of the warm peace
Once on me, but now the fear’s lifted, the cold is felt
The slipping away, mystic, then you let go of self
The feeling was noted, then the body ghosted
So I descended to the underworld to the house of shadows in a canoe with a much younger girl, without a paddle
Sailing down the “river of no return,” in the quiet lit darkness through the mirror where souls sojourned
Aboard the digital airplane, turned slave, jeweled mermaid",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-mermaid-lyrics
Grandmother’s Land,Rocket To Nebula,2020.0,"By the White Lake in Grandmother’s Land, lived about eight clans
In the midst of the tribes and their wives and children, stood a very brave man
His look disturbed as he came into the Chief’s tent for the third time, drenched, convinced that Little Waters exists
“For the third time, he was with us during the vision ceremony, we haven’t seen him since”
Agitated, he starts punching his own hand with his fist
The Chief said, “Tall Bear, you’re losing your wits, you must get a grip
The Ant People want your attention, and you must resist
There was no Little Waters with us at the fire pit”
“But Chief, he did exist, I’m not sick, he’s the one we should have peace pipe with
He spoke wonderful and righteous, disciplined enlightenment
Do you remember during the ceremony?
We took the trumpet plant to see in advance, our visions did enhance
And you warned us of the ants before we slipped into a trance
Little Waters and you over there, you put an  in his hand
I know because during the ceremony, I glanced
You said you felt the power of the yak and the elk
Little Waters played the drums to bring back your health”
The Chief said, “Please Tall Bear, relax yourself
Maybe we should bring in some tribeswomen and ask them for help”
So as the night stormed, Tall Bear went on and on on how they spoke on upper planes and other life forms
And how Little Waters captured the bison, revisit their boyhood
Joys of the white owl and the oak woods
The spirit journey to the snow wolves
Then the horse dance, sing a rain song
How he came and gone, this was no good
Chief said, “Tall Bear, I knew and spoke to you for many years
I wish your grandfather was still here
But this case is so rare
People in memories just don’t disappear
I have no idea, but please have a seat right here
Maybe you’re going crazy
Have you had sleep lately?“
Then he called for the tribes and the Medicine Ladies
They arrived with great urgency
“What’s the emergency?”
Chief said, “Tall Bear needs your care”
They all looked confused
They all asked, “Who?”
Chief said, “Ask him yourself”
They looked around the room, and said, “Chief, who are you talking to?”
The Chief said, “Tall Bear
He’s sitting right there”
They asked, “Where? There’s no one else here except us and you”
The Chief’s eyes stunned with terror and fear, his face just flared
Moments go by as they all just stare
Hours later the children walk in the teepee from behind their backs then look around the circle then ask, “What are you all staring at?”
The Spider Lady turned and said, “The Chief is very sick and hallucinating”
The children said, “What Chief?
From outside, you all sound like you all were talking to the ancient""
For years, it was only us near the tree called Wounded Knee
Above the hills where the Sioux and the big waters run free
By the White Lake, the night draped in silence over undiscovered landscapes
Day break, pine martins drank from the many puddles the rain makes
Bushes of trumpet flowers, wild grapes, marsh showers and grass lakes
As the sun bakes their empty space near White Lake near Wounded Knee, the birds fly from the tree ‘cause every now and then, that place shakes
The ground trembles just in that spot
On the right night, you can feel a mild earthquake

In Grandmother’s Land
In Grandmother’s Land
In the Grandmother’s Land, the time first began
Who was there? Tall Bear? Little Waters?
The Chief? Or was it incomplete?
Were there three really there?
Were the Medicine Ladies?

Andromeda,Rocket To Nebula,2020.0,"A holy priest and a Hopi chief meet at Snowy Peak
Right below is Coyote Creek
That’s near the dark side
Is right near the Upper and the Lower East
They both slow to speak
One says, “Wait, hold your piece”
“We came here to hear the yogi teach”
Then the chief spoke brief, said, “I brought with me my sister, Golden Geese”
“Along with her is her daughter, Lonely Sheep, my only niece”
She rose to her feet
“We are complete”
For joy, the yogi leaped
His row was neat
While the old woman rolled and knead, squeezed and beat roti yeast for the ceremony feast
Where tonight the UFOs would meet
That’s when he revealed that it’s not really shaped like a wheel but like a lotus leaf and all of us are old as trees
His palms together on folded knees
He calmed the weather with poetry
Our arms had feathers unknowingly
He said since the ovaries he’d been glowing, speaking vocally
Then it turned socially ’til he openly  twinkle in the eye
In a moment he floated free
No man pursueth when the omens flee we both agree
Howls from the wolf den
Owls in the woodlands
Hours with the bushmen
Showers over the brook tend to the worms for bait, put the hooks in
Then throw it back into the lake, then wait
If the fish take, the line shakes, then we start cooking
The trees absorb the toxic wind
Then give off oxygen for the ox and hen to watch the rocks 
Cloudy summer days right before and after storms
Forecast is warm
Spring flowers, violets, bells, orchids, roses, summer softness
Marsh lagoons, dark side of the moon, late afternoon
Wetlands, swamps, bogs, fogs through the 
The singing dogs from New Guinea
It’s misty and blue windy, a few pygmies, new city
Two pennies on the third blue hue of the you and I verse, too pretty
Robotic to aquatic, two exotic tropics on the forest to the rocket
Take off, space course
I wave and talk into the mic
Engage, days lost
The shuttle windowpane begins to frost
Nebula registered
Nah, we in the Andromeda
I hear sounds like a harmonica
Wheels down, checking the monitor
I’m aware I’m the foreigner but prepared like a popular philosopher
Study the stars like an astronomer
Bars are cinematographer
But the style is hidden like the Apocrypha
It was written in steps like a choreographer
My core is in depth like a pure photographer
My nocturnal writing
First I analyze it, then I memorize it, then internalize it, then write my journal on the science, then speak it into a verbal alignment to take you on my vertical assignment to enjoy the personal enlightenment",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-andromeda-lyrics
Mentalude (Just My Thoughts), The Psychic World of Walter Reed,2013,"Just my thoughts
It’s not Heavy Mental, but it’s just my thoughts
When I’m writing in my room, it’s like a child that’s fighting in the womb
Not guarded like a mother and
The rhyme is the publishing
But I don’t want it to come too soon
‘cause if the rhyme is premature, that means it’s not pure
The mind is my screen, the footage scenes are raw
The film inspired by the fiends that lean in my hall and killers and thieves who schemed on my flaw
So when I write a rhyme, it seems like I withdraw
‘cause it took a lot of time to find a means for our cure
So I do this rhyme like I was operating
Deliver the right flow took lots of patience
I would head underground and lock my basement
And I suffered  while y’all waiting
Now before I begin, first I sterilize every one of my pens
Slide in the CDs of instrumentals and blends
‘cause the pencil’s my syringe
Then I throw on surgical gloves before I write my rhyme
It’s open book surgery when I slice the line
Every stroke, I leave scars
But when it’s spoke, they’re called bars
And what I wrote, it’s for god
And not only smoke to get charged
Now I’m cinematic with graphics
The pen that I craft with is the lens to a camera that the photographer snapped with
Writing rhymes the way pictures are developed
The rhyme has no color ’til I kick it a cappella
Process the rhymes in a dark room
It’s where I edit it
But in my film, I keep the negatives
‘cause it has the gems and all the messages
Step two: put the flow under my mind’s faucet and turn the rhyme into a portrait
I go there, redesign the orbit
My thoughts lit
Light up my skull like a jack-o-lantern
My eyes disappear then they flash a mansion
Priest the rap Samson
The black phantom of the hip-opera
I’m the  philosopher, stigmata of Big Poppa
I’m the real King Solomon
Y’all all my hologram",https://genius.com/Killah-priest-mentalude-just-my-thoughts-lyrics

Something wonderful is unfolding within my writtens
Inside my space book, the Jesus, jedi, the unknown, god’s chromosome
Beautiful color tone cover my bones
The sky color of red dye
Beneath the ascension solar system
From supernovas, I unrolled into this existence
Unfolded, vibrated out of light
But icy shadows gave me my pigment
My flesh is tinted, opium scented
No religion, I wrote the sentence
I’m true and living
The summer ghost and the yellow coat
I watch the sky crack like an egg
The clouds spread out like the whites, the sun was the yolk
Liquid sunshine, wishful dreams
Mystic pastime, I fed the fish in the stream
That’s where I met her, Metu Neter, Neter Metu
Before the ancestors came to get her
From a pillar of smoke, she spoke
My humble posture stood by the willow oak
She said, “Killah, you woke, stay woke”
We spoke all night ’til day broke
It’s like I spoke to Gabriel or hundreds of angels
Standing at the top of the trail was a gray horned owl
Storm clouds, then calmed down
It’s late afternoon in the woods where there’s bears and wolves
It’s rare but oh yeah, without a care, I’m good
The freelancer in the flatlands
I need answers, don’t tap dance
More enhanced black man
In the daylight , we never seen the meadows and the marshlands
Ta-da, I make my art stand with a harp in hand
Imagination parades with a marching band
All started from rapping at park jams
It’s funny, sometimes I think it’s all part of a plan
The ghetto never seen the evergreen
Long fields of rain over prairies
Open country, floating fairies
Fine dandelions to sleep in, emotions are heavy
Right here is where you vision a patch of berries
These are Bob Ross thoughts, but my paint brush is how I came up
It was gang stuff, stick ups, cocaine rush
Hop in the trains and the bus
Hold up, let me explain, I never thought King Tut was the same as us
Never puffed dust, maybe once
Never slang much but the football game was tough
Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood was in the midst of robbers on Gates and Hood’s

Enter where there's no air till you find your corpse
Yo, enter with caution it's the hood dark and haunted
See those crackheads with dead eyes their souls been torment
Look at the old man throwing up his body organs
Smell a odor in the air cause of dead corpses
Just keep walking keep observing I'll do the talking
This is the hood they don't visit often
This is the war after nuclear war end
And this is your schools old ruins no more babies
Because the law that they passed at the UN
These the blueprints of the world they plan to ban music
Let the camera crew and the news in
They got the right to hear this
This the truest and the realest you'll ever get it

Come with me up the dark stairwell where dealers dwell
Now ask yourself could this be hell look
See that man with elephant hands
Now take a glance at the skeletons of that tramp and a pimp
Now take a whiff of the blunt smoke guns coke
Young folks that swung dope
This is the year 3 thousand
Flee the housing
Just keep browsing at the ghetto
We call it devil's island
I swear I see the demon smiling
At every child and drug dealing to a slug'll kill him
Yo I feel like the whole worlds lost its base
I'm clapping at the beast by taking the cannon off my waist
Sing along

Chasin' monkeys, the silverback is hungry
It's rainin' tea, comin' from a foreign country
It's the battle sword, the pharaoh lord
A pile of wool, armor of martyrs that he conquered
The monster of honor, bring me agua!
His horse was girded with pearl gems
His nostrils breathe out fire like charcoal, the dark soul
Last as he passes his enemies ash, the terror face scowls
He trampled a nest of doves and bear cubs
While throwin' the spear like a souvenir
The Ruler is here, all cheer
The skies and the moon was clear
Draggin' on the end of his wagon was so-called bad man
He was laughin', lift up his javelin
The lion roared, he twirled his sword like? Merlin Nathal?
Blasphemous became weepers
There stood the king of ancient Babylon
Carry on; I stand like Istanbul for that religion y'all pulled
The king grew more angry, strangely
A strange tree grew in front of the old castle
The tabernacle chapels were all black
His axe, hacked off the heads and arms and legs
A fog from the grave was all gray and thick
The king's ears went pointy and weird
His teeth grew fangs and it hanged from his jaws
The lord of lords, the Moors adored
A cheetah stirred and slept
He leaped runnin' into the night
At night, the light, that the clouds threw
Cut trees into two, the eagle lands in his nest
The hair of the empress
The temptress wore a thin dress
The vampire sire, biter on the neck
The second death, to resurrect
A dagger in the belly, a knife to the throat
