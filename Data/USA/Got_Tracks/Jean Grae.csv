Kill Screen a.k.a. Steve Wiebe,Gotham Down Deluxe,2013.0,"This is rebel shit - Mojave rock
Got polyglots, who'll molly whop you 'til your body pop
I'm never sick, when my temperature drop, it's 7 Up
105.6 hell, praise the rock
I ain't a savior, just your neighbor like amazing Peter
Minus the spider bite, the webs, the Aunt and Uncle neither
But save the reasoning, the need to tuck the dynamite
To even up the nonbelievers
Man humble season was cool, sure
Now I'm seeing North Shore faces, are y'all sure
Turn around and walk four paces
I'll walk forth five, y'all 86'ed in all cases
I'm the figure 8 sideways, always ageless
Y'all in the club aimless, blind, spades shit
My time and space mix, record a rhyme on spaceships
You way behind like you caught a ride on a slave ship
I'm the modern anomaly, brazen Amelie, faceless
Representing the basement, raised up, cage less
Limitless, reminiscent of rapists
Boundaries, got none; rock, paper, shotgun
Achtung, baby not an A.D.D 80's baby I'm not from
Rated G catering eras
I was the type of New Yorker rhyming at night in the park
And hiding a knife in hair and even though Mama was careful
I would be fighting so often, finding the light in dark
Was time and just life in the mirror
Reflection infinite, Escher
In the end, we are who we are, Ke$ha
Late night dive bar, sipping on a vesper
I'm Bond and the villain in one time bomb, test her
Dressed mismatch like confederate soldiers
Told ya best to think fast, this level is over
I'm going for the kill screen, fistful of quarters
Billy Mitchell, I'm a fiend; jumping barrels, famous sauces
Was a preteen prodigy, plethora of knowledge
I don't mean like Albert Johnson, I mean Jean was on to college
I'll never respect a comment from a novice
I'll never be just a common denominator, I promise
I was nominated flyest so you'll see I'll take us higher, the defiant one
The phoenix from the fire, hell mouth leviathan
Only get killed at the end of time so I'm buying some
This is heavy metal - Ryerson
Or Reitman & Mogel '81 either is right man
Life spans eternal ever since I touched the mic stand
Put the mic in my right hand; left hook, goodnight man
Rest good, hype man, Jeannie take it easy
Like bikinis on some white sand is on me
I'm calm b, sipping on a zombie, Condé, Nast
No bath salts spilling in my flask
I'm appealing to your class
Laugh now get shot later with sedatives
Medicate to torture you some more so aww, you better live
Edifice, living in a world full of Oedipus
It's all relative, melanin, nepotism
Tell the kids hell is in, check the prisons
I wanna teach particle physics business
Just as a better business class, syllabus rise up
You wanna get your philistine thighs up
My abilities high as fuck, still willing to try luck
I wish I had guillotine garage doors
Mass carnage, barnyard parties, animals, carnivores
Trash, garbage, Skarsgård hotties, mandibles, parting jaws
Bleeding y'all dry of convictions, the art of war",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-kill-screen-aka-steve-wiebe-lyrics

Back here at square one
Like I just did the home base run
Without winning any bases though
All basic reasoning out the window
Ron Browz shit, Erick Sermon style
Like I got kicked off a cloud
Method Man, ‘95
Rap references because you get em all
You even get that I should have said that it was ’94 (’93)
Hard place when you wanna still rock to it
Living in my glass house
Steady throwing rocks through it
I never stopped feeling the love for ya
I just stopped being the one for ya
I think
Too much
Over analyzing everything sucks
I’m over over-dramatizing everything but
You’re never on the level I’m on, unless we’re cut-ting
Plus then we never argued when thrusting but then
After all, it just turns to dust, brother
Swear I’d never love another if this really worked out
But this is just like watching fitness informercials from the couch
Ouch
I know, you’re lazy
It’s easier to pick a partner less crazy
Much less work, less purpose, less of A to Z
Cause I’m an alpha, bet it’s hard to stay with me
Heart palpitations do still occur though
You and me, some Merlot, situation blurs so
Much I be thinking how this shit could actually work again
It’s even nice to have you back in my world as my friend
Hey, sometimes I gotta say it simply (why)
Cause sometimes things are simple (come on)
We make it complicated for the win, B
Cause otherwise we’d just be faced with all the n-words
Inner child, inner space, inner monologue
We exchange intercourse without a dialogue
Introduce intimate ways to turn our fire off
The thing in us that seeks the spark, light
Higher, moth
I still adore you; you adore me theoretically
So now I gotta shut the door on you
So I can find out who is next for me

You and me and everyone we know
That’s you and me and everyone we know

Cause you know, you’re not gonna find what you’re looking for
Stay searching
You and me and everyone we know
It’s you and me and everyone we know
It’s you and me
You and me and everyone we know
You, me, everyone we know
You and me and everyone we know",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-u-me-everyoneweknow-lyrics
BET Cypher 2012: The True School,UnKnown,UnKnown,"2012, stop saying ""femcee""
It's not a word, I'll hop the curb and hit you with my ten-speed
Bike spokes everywhere
Hi folks, I'm very rare
Veteran who's getting better every year
Sicker than Sloan Kettering, whole floors is lawless
Benevolent applause cause everything I'm spittin' flawless
Praying so much my Spanish friends call me Lourdes
Quarter Loch Ness, 75% Chuck Norris
Incredible dominating performance
Every time, every line; flawless
Gabby Douglas, Dominque Dawes spit
Stickin' landings and the wit is just enormous
Your a Dick Santorum fan, I can afford to pause it
Come back on the fourth hit
Have dudes screamin' ""Have you ever really loved me, Jeanie?""
Rat face, Stevie so at me, Jean Greasy
I'm bad

Some of you MC's need to check up your flow at the Korle Bu hospital
Your punches are weak, your flows don't represent the streets
That's your only disease, Hip Hop refugees
Forget it, because when y'all deliver your flow
Then y'all turn out to be a laughing stock
The music business ain't by force
If you release 2 to 4 singles and you still don't break through
In the future when I am dead and gone
Y'all name a parking lot after me
I'm the rap supreme, I rap in different flavors
Lame rappers go to sleep cause y'all degrading the hip hop scene
So many MC's back in Africa making a perfect meal
But I'm the missing ingredient, call me the Irish cream
Give me a round of applause, cause I killed it
Rapperholic soldier
Obidi I tongue twist 24/7, I thought I told ya
They dig my policy, dig my legacy, dig my energy
Yes! Obidibiponbidi
What else?

I'm decent but I'm despicable, spittin' the inexplicable
Pickin' stems out the piccolo, tickle your brain ventricles
They finally let the nerd with the swag in
I was playin' the background like an adlib
But now I'm greedy like a fat kid
Old lady don't blow my high
Cause my pants hang low and you can't see my eyes
I get faded like Smokey but I'm crazy with the motif
Eatin' rappers, I need mo' teeth, you think I'm obese
Movin' with the movement, you don't need no lease
So fly, I don't need no feet, how I run it?
Keefin' up, when I'm coolin' with my young'ns
You know I keep it 3hunna
Can't take it lower, I used to loiter, these days I need a lawyer
Call your employer, tell him Soulo on the market
I love Indo but Do-Dawg love endorsements
I was never into Porches or Polo Horses
More like Nibiru's orbit, ascension in Pyramid coffins
It's safe to say I'm thinkin' in a major way
I reckon you take your exit and make your way out
Its my time, not Morris Day's now
The more the days go by, the more I'm reminded that I'm a Titan
If there was ever, whats pressure to a diamond?
I'm the Haile Selassie of rhyming
Ab-Soul

You spit dummy, I get money like Clark Howard
BET, lemme show you black star power
It's funny they want me to spit
When really they never play me though
On the real, the alternative is what you hear on the radio
Fashion designer rappers
Wanna climb back inside of their Mama's vaginas
When passionate rhymers become reminders, son
You stay sleepin' on me, you soft the Satin pajamas, son
My hood is like the jungle with lions packin' the llama's
From Vandavere's to Gowanus, I'm so notorious
Fightin' my way back to Brooklyn like we the warriors
Right in your face, ain't no life line for you to call on
You simple like a pimple, you sort of an oxymoron
I'm graceful as Jordan with the fade-away
Write a passage as painful as circumcision with a razor blade
I stay open cause I'm better with words
I'm Frank Ocean at a Chik-Fil-A, I'll never get served",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-bet-cypher-2012-the-true-school-lyrics
My Story,Jeanius,2008,"“If I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back...”  I write
That, but infinity can’t rewind facts
.  
You are
Divinity.  My primitive mind was struggling
Just to understand the meaning of life, forgive me
I never told my mommy, I couldn’t break her spirit.  She always
Wished her daughter extraordinary thinking
, 
so I
Traveled alone, young, sixteen, got in
The habit of not staying at home
, 
doing the
Sad walk like Bill Bixby
, 
a dollar fifty
Trips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me
I couldn’t eat shit.  I fainted frequent
On cold floors and I pause and I think, “Keep it”
I’m lost.  My four friends know 
and just
Fuck at the boys’ apartments for rent
, so I’m all
Wishing that it’s a dream ending soon.  I’ve actually
Erased a lot that I’ve been through

See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be
I know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)

Now all my bitter homies saying, “That’s what men do.”  Feeling
Retarded for seeing partner potential
.  On top
Of that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  
I can’t
Take it, I’m contemplating a Glock burner, a
Cop murderer
.  I can’t leave.  This can’t be
The tears streaming, and I can’t see they lanced me
And I’m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had
To cover the mass amounts.  I’ve had enough
And you don’t know what it’s like in waiting rooms, and out-
-side, their picketing pictures could slay you
They’re screaming, “Victims,” and spitting ‘til they shame you
I hold my head low and shiver, push my way through
They put you in a room where you can change into
Your gown and shower cap
, 
shaking as a fiend would do
And that’s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building
And then they call you and you’re hearing the call of your children
They count down from ten now.  You wanna stop ‘em, but
You say it in your head: you’re out for the cut
And then you wake up in another room with plenty others
They call it recovery.  You’re thinking, “We ain’t mothers”
And then prescription pills, written a ‘script with chills
An understatement.  You’re dressed but you’re naked still
And your brain won’t think straight
Wait.  Can’t finish this

See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be
I know what I’ve done (Please forgive me)

I kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills
Screaming, “God what have you done?”  Cried ‘til I snotted blood
Then got a gun.  My temple ran quick though
From the thought, 
then the worst: I was caught in the same place
A year later.  For me, that’s when hatred started
My faith martyred
.  I’ve dated the father of a father
Then I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt’s
Worse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed
Then I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to
A breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down
I was a failure at that too, 
bailed from
The rap then, but fate took me back in
“Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  
Twenty-seven
With three kids that I never met.  What if I
Was Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how
Their mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell
To the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly
I am a monster, see.  How could I possibly
Correspond with God when I gave the authority
To end their life?
But it’s never over, even if we have a child
They could have had a brother or a sister or both
I’m thinking about another life that almost got close
Praying that, in another time, we could have changed posts
If I could just reverse time, I would
I don’t know what I would do.  Honestly, it’s not good
I’m sorry...",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-my-story-lyrics

Circle tobacco ring blower
I'll murk you black. Get sewn up
My work is black
I got diplomas in the back
That are bursting over the sack that I hold em in
Cause its folder was folding over
I know what they been told ya
But since I'm going in again, it's like drop and bend over
Over and over, with no lube
Get that veteran in embedded in yo stools
Yokels, locals
Slow cruise to yo demise, know it in the vocals
I got no couth, no lies; I'm dedicated, focused
Opposite of Bette Davis oculars, waiting for the apocalypse
Strapped with a cape in case I get popular, so I can drop it, bitch
The clock ticks. Y'all concerned with crotch sticks
I'm concerned with moxie, Take your Oxycontin, and your rocks
I'm The Great Gatsby initials, the Casebasket epistle
The last greatest apostle, the baddest damie
The combination of Gladys Knight and Pips in one place
And a Robert Blake fan
I'll keep you in a basement
While chained to a day bed
With the door blocked with a Maytag
And at four o'clock I'll let snakes in
And stand in the door sipping a tall boy
Coors light and giggle in your face then
Sociopath, with a golden flask
And I'll fill with it gasoline to throw at yo ass
And then fill it up back again with some of your pieces
Your liver, your back, your face a bit of your penis
Double hands with a W
Better do whatever you can to cover you
Jean Lang came to clubber you
Pain, whatcha gonna do

Fuckery level 3000, in jeans and a green blouse
With a crimson stain from a beat down
At a business meeting in a tea lounge
Like, ""Nah, I'm cool, please, sit down
Proceed,"" bleeding out
The whole team freaking out, text-ing each other under the table
I'm office space calm, I offer face palms
Comma face balm for after on my dot com; I'm basically batshit
You basic bastard I never pace it
I crave action, I transform like I'll save y'all
But then I stay Ratchet
I'll bash your face in the baseboards of a burning building
With the passion of a pastor passing plates and getting back millions
Dash in a race and abandon smashing the tape at the last second
Then beckon to children on the sidelines who'd all step in and start blasting
Bach, Sebastian, or Rachmaninoff or Handel playing
When I'm candle lighting and man handling I'm saying, I'm classy
Dokken and Sebastian Bach blaring
When I'm mass murdering turned to decibels
Certain to drown the tears, it's nasty
On the Pulaski bridge, trunk full up with the shotgun, shotgun
Tongue dripping with vodka, dripping on my lap on a map of Alaska
In October, in a black dress and blasting Frank Zappa
The consummate top assassin
The consulate tracking after
And flipping the birds to diplomats out the whip
With an Andy Richter mask on
Cause I passed on getting a sidekick
Cause everybody ain't ready to die for this
I'll drive on dialysis, I'll drive over your dialysis
And keep in mind that I don't even drive; I like challenges
Roseannadanna fan, fan of Dan from Roseanne but not a fan of Prozac
And I don't care how you find them
Wanna know what I'm like, fine then
I'll like fine men, smart men, where the fuck do you find them
No, seriously, I'm actually asking you where can find them
I'm into crime and environments that you cry in
I don't imply it, I vividly give you my end
You'll think I'm lying 'til shivering in a lion's den
In an abandoned zoo naked covered with flies and
Strapped to Kobe beef steaks
Ya don't believe me, for Pete's sake
Man, what the fuck do I have do to convince you
I'm the Freeway villain
Kiefer Sutherland
I love when people suffering
It feels like I'm on reefer when they're blubbering
I'm serious
I'm FCC's damn problem, and
At best Tsidi's man problems
I guess could be the one thing I wanna work on
I'm glad that we're getting this work done
Guess i would have never thought to talk, but who knew
Getting this out could be cool
We should totally do this next week
You're good, you
You look testy",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-fuckery-level-3000-lyrics
Lovesong,Attack of the Attacking Things,UnKnown,"Ooh, that was wrong!  Oh man.  You told me stuff, and we gots to find a song for them all.  It’s appreciation though.  Yo, Dee, to start, play the original so I can get in the mood to kick these verses.  Alright, oh, uh, yeah, yeah.  I see you, love.  I said, “All the time.”  Does it ever puzzle you?  Have you asked why?  Nah.  I know I do.  I do, it’s true.  I ain’t pretending, man.  Aight, aight.  Let’s get into it, for real, for real.  Aight?  One.  Drop it, drop it

You’re alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you?
Have you asked why you seem
To fall in love?  Out again
Do you ever really love?
Or just pretend?
Why fool yourself?
Don’t be afraid
To help yourself
It’s never too late, too late to stop...
 (x7)
Here’s a little story that must be told

She grew up
Believing in passion and love, whose folks divorced and remarried
Very naïve, seen life and commitments that
Should have been dead and buried, highly sentimental, sensitive
Gentle beyond the point she should be.  What might be obvious
To most, she says they’re too bitter, can’t see
The world the way she does, clean lungs, undamaged liver, sees
Thugs through her pink-tinted glasses.  Occasionally, weed
Does make her giggle, listen to some music closer, dudes
Approach her lightly, wanna be her lover, and she obliges
Likes to cuddle under the covers by candlelit fires
Oblivious to lying schemes to talk her out of clothes, says
She’s just in love with love, cuts her classes, spends too much time
Entrancing, romancing.  Things are changing quickly.  She’s asking
“Why aren’t you spending more time with me?” Nigga’s eyes are getting
Shifty, coming over later smelling of pussy on his face
Jeans and sweaters—something’s fishy.  And it’s not what
He tells her, man, it’s what he don’t, and she don’t understand
And, for some years, she probably won’t.  Just wants an honest man
For goodness sake, they’re backstabbing and cutting her throat
Restraining orders follow, but she still optimistic about it
Like Annie, thinking “Tomorrow” maybe will be a better day
I let her pray on bended knees, ask him to send Prince Charming, please
She’s never cheated, treats her man well, cooks, cleans
Dresses sexy for him, halter tops and tight jeans, would break
The law for him, go through a couple of these relationships
Still stays strong, she’s too young and dumb to call it quits
Learns that she carrying twice, scared and afraid the first
Time.  The second, she don’t even cry.  He makes her wipe away
His tears and it hurts.  They always leave and turn crazy, so
She doesn’t flirt, spends time warning the babies
Goes through a couple of these relationships and still stays strong
Too young and dumb to call it quits.  It’s still a love song

She’s got
A good man.  She’s nineteen, he’s twenty-one and sweet and honest
Promised to love her, talk of marriage. She would never wanna
Be somebody’s baby’s mother, use rubbers occasionally
When she’s flowing, open off the affection and gifts and all
The good manners he’s showing.  He’s trying to build a life for himself
Studies late, computer shit, and she’s missing attention that
She’s not getting, sex dwindles.  Crawling in the sheets, he say
He tired, and she say she feel neglect and defeat, just doesn’t
See his ambition, she wanna be the universe and hold
His center position, starts hanging ‘round the best friend more
Crazy attraction, takes impulsive action, dropped the drawers
And falls in love, the world explodes when she confesses.  “Yeah, I did it
So?”  They’re so tight, it’s like he moves when she stretches.  Over
The couple years, too many stresses, girls who wanna fight her
Bitches writing letters, friendships disappearing, plus
He rhymes, so it’s competitive pressure, miscarriage.  They break up
Fifty times a week and make up just as much.  He fucking
And I know, but pretending I’m out of touch.  It’s getting
Strained and gets physical, she cries until the river dries
And leaves her dead and cold, packs up her things and leaves behind.  What I
Had thought was gold was only gold-plated.  Thinking of all
The other ones I could have just left and up and dated
Single after four years.  Starting over never easy, but it
Takes some time to realize your own worth, come into
Your own, play your mental rebirth.  She starts penning some
Better poems, straighten up her bank account, likes to take
Herself out.  I’m getting better at it.  I’ve had
A few relationships, but still too young and dumb enough to call
It quits.  It’s still a love song

Love
All I ever want is you
All I ever had
Needed in my life was you
All that ever was, all I ever had

Maybe it’s
Easier to talk about this shit in third person, learning
Better, looking for nub in all the wrong places like I’m
Eddie Murphy, curse me to repeat the same cycle I’m breaking
No longer think relations make a better woman, just
For life I’m pursuing, growing but hopelessly romantic still
Tasted weather in the bitter climates, love the sunshine better
Dreaming of dream proposals, decent moral values placing
Higher on my chart, trying not to have a shallow heart
But battle scars are deep and reach into the depths of Hell and back
Try to give up the grudges.  Think it’s experience
And move from the clutches of sadness.  It’s difficult
Sometimes, I wish I wasn’t an adult.  Adolescent
Primetime sitcom star, I’ve been too far
And too much, too hard for too long.  It’s still a love song",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-lovesong-lyrics

How To Break Up With Your Girlfriend,Laid In Full (Chapter 2),UnKnown,"Listen up
I'm here to lay down the rules of breaking up
With you girlfriend at the end of relationship
There's lots of things you can do and many ways you can do it
I'll only give you ideas you'll have to walk yourself through it
This is not for players, I repeat, Do not try this at home
If the chick that your with is only so your dick can get boned (This is serious business)
Only follow through if you've been in a horrifying partnership for at least a year or two
Moving on
And if your girl is carrying your seed
Don't even waste your time listening to me
No Yeah
If you want to ditch her cause she's not a freak when she's in the sheets?
Go to the nudie bars and learn how to teach
I'm talking to you niggas with chicks who are gold diggers and brew
Cheated on you, Conceited and getting greedy on you
You know what you're doing
Just every five minute, get your limits on your chilling
Smoking weed or intake of Guinness
This is for y'all
The girls who take the dough, the keys to the car and be in the mall
The only thing she buy you is a phone that only she can call
Psycho chicks who like to scream in the street
Chicks who get off on being beat
Bitchy as hell in front of your mom? Man that's weak
If you live with her but she won't get a job and likes to eat
Or if you've been with her mad long but outside she's still discreet
Never mind, forget that last one, you don't count, beat concerns
If she won't hold your hand in public?(That's not your girl)
This is for men with psychos, fat girls with tight clothes
Devil strippers and hoes who date grade in night clothes
In condoms they break holes
And all their friends are stray pigeons
Listen, you getting fucked is their favourite position
I'mma help you out
Tell you how to get rid of bitches who only want you for your dick or your riches
Telling you
Just doubt before your shit bitches
They ain't your sisters, they trife
Whether your girl, fiancé or wife
Get 'em out of your life

Man they gotta go
I'm just trying to let you know
How to break up with your girlfriend (Oh no)
She trying to do you wrong (Uh-huh)
Listen to the song(Why?)
It's how to break up with your girlfriend (She's trife)
So you better listen up (Word)
You can get stuck or learn
How to break up with your girlfriend (There's many ways man)
Just pick one
You gotta be done (I know)
How to break up with your girlfriend

Number one, run
Number two, threaten her with a gun
Number three, just a synonym for one, flee
Number four, when she goes out just lock the door
Hang up a sign that says closed and keep it up there like you're running a store
Five, never arrive on time, show up for dates two days late
Never ever apologize and I'm eight
Number six, constantly call her a bitch but in German
Seven, start off every Sunday with a sermon
Eight, masturbate, but only with her and only in public, in romantic restaurants (Baby rub it)
Number nine, tell her ""shove it""
Ten, take it back, cry, say it again
Number eleven, make her write an essay on seven
If she won't, for number twelve
Just tell the bitch that she's going straight to hell (I thought we were doing swell)
There's no number thirteen cause I believe in superstition
One four, make the back door your only position
One five, tell her that you need it daily sixteen times
Seventeen, tell her that you had a really bad dream
It was in the office, beat her to death with a fax machine
Eighteen, buy a fax
Next, keep it by the bed
Every morning when she wakes up, hold it over her head
Number nineteen, tell her your becoming a priest
Twenty, tell her that you want to live together, show her a lease
Tell her that it's a surprise, tell her cover her eyes
Lead her down a dark alley to a cardboard box
Remove the blindfold, watch her just feint from shock
Two one, tell her that you had a son when you was twelve
Twenty-two, tell her that you're Melle Mel
Twenty-three, every time that she lets go of your hand proclaim to the world ""I'm free""
Twenty-four, hit yourself repeatedly
And finally when you get down to number twenty-five
Look her straight in the eye and say ""baby are you a guy"" (breath through clenched teeth)
Now look, if none of this works, remember I ain't tell you shit
Just tell her she's a bad job and you quit",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-how-to-break-up-with-your-girlfriend-lyrics
Hater’s Anthem,Bootleg of the Bootleg EP,2003.0,"Liquid content may cause y'all faggot's frames to burst
Insane rhyme structure flame your brain, I blame birth
The game switched-a made a retainer greater picture of lame dames that couldn't be felt with braille scripture
Even deaf kids are rockin' ear plugs
I rip you then stick you with sticks I dipped in arsenic filled jugs
I'm official you bitches. I ignite under certain circumstances
Flip back and have your ass kicked by backup dancers
Cancer chokin' the mad hatter the Jabberwocky of rap and hibernate in
Contemplate and now I'm finally back
The throat changed so hopscotch your ass back
I play close like a thong huggin' that ass crack
Verb pleat scab riddled permanent scars
Scratch deep like a cheap box of CD-Rs
Spread heat like I'm gia's drawers
Pleading the 4th in court like he's the boss then I carry you off
I'm more necessary than violence on the Amistad (Oh my god)
You grown like eating bacon on Ramadan
I'll piss on your shoes and make you clean em with your mouth
Then I'll tell all your friends I'll send Depends to your house
Must be crazy but the speed not to ya lady
File a DNA test so it's not your baby
(Maybe we can be friends?) No, just pretend
I slip razors in your charm bracelet; slit your skin bitch

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

Super enhanced survival shoot em with a crucial plan
Infatuated with music in loops, no scruples man
Phrase-ologist. Non-apologetic mutiliator
Stays all of this defaming names so they can sue me later
Hater, yes
The kinderst gas the fate opposer
Philanthropist, misanthropist, underground soldier
Banana clips just start unloading in your supermarkets screaming till your
Hoarse, bleeding, finding out that you're the target
Monotony flow, contradictory, word plays and like bringing Satan to a
Baptism in a flooded basement
Jean's out to lunch, she ain't even punched in yet
You're a facsimile, I'm the original document
All shock and then lights out drop em in. Selections are very buried
Improper things 
I'm married to rap like J.Lo to scandals
Light up a room like J. Hov's birthday candles
I'm that bright like Steven Hawking's computer chair
Asked out a teacher on a Sadie Hawkin's dare
Parallax you, see the future in my sleep
I'll battle rap you until your gullet starts to leak
Gnash your teeth and smash you then bind your feet
Thrash holes in your dome snatch your soul and retreat
Mad Max-ish the prose so dope it's fantastic
Now fold up your dough before you get yo ass kicked

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, hold up
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, wait, nah
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, ok
Fuck you, fuck you, everybody

Rush the door like a Russian whore
Mail order bitch sent to Dahmer's crib
It's an honor to split your armor blood drip
Like pulp fiction when bits o' bones get on ya
Shit, I just talk jargon disregard margins
Liquid date any enemies rap incarnate
I'm cynical, criminal actions excite me
My mic chords an umbilical that radiates high beams
Humorous, filled with more flow than a cumulus cloud
Dentist mad, he said my words abuse my mouth, so I upchucked em
Gut buck em out. Chuckle loud, duck down screaming fuck the crowd
Specialize staggered mixed 
malt liquor
 with 
jolt cola
Start drinking when cops start lookin' over their shoulder
Nastier than central booking sandwiches
 handling tough
Cranky in the morning after smoking the canibus stuff
Can't see it like Orphan Annie's pupils in the cartoons
Can't be it like tranny's who paid for implanted wombs
Nope. That's not it
Close but no cigar
Dutch lit but I'm passing it right past ya Paul
That's all, that's Jean the definitive minister
The sarcastic lip bar spitter competitor
The un-cosmetic duck shit on your pedestal
Sanitarium released, the most unforgettable
Motov dirt Molotov your face
Then lock you in a box and watch you burn in a closed space
Big face get your shit taken and replaced with a ticking case that's
Strapped to your waist
(Duh) You move to slow sloth boost your movement
Your mind counts time like down south screw music
Who's it
The Phoenix wings spread like an Ox said
I'll knock you out a window make you literally drop dead

Love Thirst,Jeanius,2008.0,"My caramel mahogany fairy tale
He gon' do very well
Fearing for the farewell, stay awhile
We could just lay awhile
See me smile better
Lean your chest on me, make you my sweater
I want the rest of you
Pressing me head-up, I need contact
Your windows reflecting me back
Later I ask where your memories at
Your face telling me that
You need a taste, where the Hennessey's at
C'mon, lace me
Replace glasses with the tip of my tongue
I won't front baby, lady is sprung
And though relation is young
I feel us making a connection beyond
So that I (ssssss) like a chick in a saun'
No lie, won't I
Take my time, let the bass unwind
Claymation couldn't mold a better mind,
 you're sick
And I'll be the nurse and you be the patient
Boy, how insane could it get
You so high, baby

High, you're making me so
High, you're getting me so
High, c'mon
High, you're making me so
High, baby I'm
So high off your love, ooh, ooh

Okay, turn the lights out
No turn 'em back on
Want you to see my backbone and my black tone
Start minimal, raise it to animal please
You're no amateur, please me I'm tangible
Knees be all tangled up, like the handles
Placed on the mantle, that romantic angles
We'll slow dance til tangoing gets horizontal
I know you go longer than flows with no comma
I'm high on ya, you like it don't cha
Could survive by just biting on ya
Like those, high notes, nibble just a little bit
Everything I'm thinking you're already delivering it
Quiver, pleasure unheard
You ain't even done first baby when I done burst
Crazy I'm in love thirst, you are the quencher
Maybe we should be taping so you can remember
I'm just saying


High, you're making me so
You're making me so - high
I'm getting so - high
Baby, high off
Why not
Stop, okay
Don't stop
It's loud, c'mon

Don’t Rush Me,This Week,2004.0,"9th, 9th's got them beats that you just sing to for no reason
{*laughs*}
Sometimes you got to get to know yourself
You gotta travel a little bit
Look at yourself from another perspective
So I try to do that
Come on

Listen, there's nothing like knowin' yourself
Like the way I know that the smoke has kind of broken my health
Like the way I know my flow don't make appropriate wealth
I can't change that
But, funny I'm sayin' that when it's money I'm aimed at
I give a fuck if you frame that or quote it (shit)
I meant what I said 'cause I wrote it—point noted
I know I'm overly sensitive when it comes to, well
Just about everything
And I'm so hardheaded—I don't need your help
Like no advice for these records 'less it's me and myself
Like, I don't ever want to breathe if it requires assistance
Just, just shut down my system
I'm a victim of choosin' bad love, bad luck Lucy
Every man touched seems to be a doozy and plus
I'm attached to this looseleaf, stand on my two feet
So it's hard enough to even have to physically move me
Go ahead, try

I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga (just try)
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, get your hand off me, man)
Don't rush me (you stupid?  I'll cut you)

I gotta be more disciplined
I'm listenin' more to straight logic, blocking random shit that's drifting in
Age is a motherfucker (damn right)
Find myself staring at the little kids, thinking ""I can beat 'em like a stepmother""
Creeping on a come-up at thirty soon
But looking twenty, ooh
The food catches up to you now plenty
Attending christenings of my best friend's children
And then asking who's next
And I'm wishing for six more wishes for Christmas or
Kids on the wish list
Or time machines to be in existence
I'm a team player—not (nope)
The dry wit is similar to Arizona weather.  Say it, nigga—""Hot""
Patent leather sole, tappin' at my bowl
If the album's not platinum, then I'll have to rack a gold
This rappin' ain't for nothin'
Unless I hold plaques so I can sit up on a boat like Colin, roll that
And you know that

I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me (hey, didn't I just tell you?)
Don't rush me (fall back, nigga)

See, this here is the most serious that I've ever been
The most clear headed
My gear fetish clearly needs an account
So if I need, I'll smoke 'em all like Dennis Leary and I'm out
Beef's great though, thanks for addin' more insecurities
Just as I was findin' my level of maturity
Just as I was mindin' my business, tried to murder Jean's confidence
But lucky for me, you're all incompetent
Road block in this, yes
I see 'em tryna put a stop to my obnoxiousness but
I stay long-winded like sayin', ""George Papadopoulous""
I know but I write from this heart with this
So, I've got some things to work on
My moodiness like masturbation—gets its jerk on
My fascination with the fast pace
The money's encapsulated in my mind space like ""What a thrill""
Past dated and I know I'm not in last place
But it's hard to work through it with this masked face
And masking tape up on the window keeps the cold out
And every time I'm laying down, my back breaks because it's old now
I yell too much, get stressed too quick
But the best thing about it—I can change that shit
And still remain who I came down to Earth to be
It's not Jean Grae—that's just a name, you'll see

I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
But don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both—I'm the dark and light
And they say, ""Life means everything to live""
At the same time, I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

Please don't make me kill you, I don't want to
I don't need to go to jail right now
I got things to do
Can't be locked up, man
My momma, my momma
No momma.  No, no
Anyway, yo, thanks man
Thank you 9th
And we had a beautiful lunch
Don't be afraid to talk in the back
Thanks everybody for coming out tonight

Girl in the school parking lot with a fat spliff
Old shit, full circle, Bob Barker, back flips
Got mad rap kids but not a Catholic
Preaching that gospel, not Baptist
Redesign placements, 
nos-ag-stic
Getting too crazy? My bad, shit
Right, you ain't lazy, I'm bat shit
Basket case, you can blame me, it's the madness
J.G., congrats, bitch
In rap's last place, so the vantage point's dangerous
A black ditch underground cave where the canvas
Is the wall around me stained with my blood and my fans' pics
A motherfucker with nothing to lose is a bad bitch
Misconstrued, miss my aim, you lose
Kiss the shoes,
 diss my name, hiss, boos
Your clique is fools, fucking with niggas and jigaboos
I'm sick of buffoons, fucking sick of thinking of coons
I ain't ever dig a rule, or kick a particular tune
I'm penning its venting me nicotine, liquor, and booze
I'm me, 
choose choice
, it's the new shit
Don't be confused, boys, the new shtick is no shtick -- promote this
Offbeat, off road shit, with a Kotex
Flow mo heavy than most chicks
So fuck a 28 days -- I keep a Tampax with my show shit
Right next to an open bottle reekin' of roses
Next to a broken bottle seepin' leakin' neurosis
Sleeping on Jeannie? Most is?
Most ears ain't heard of the beating, cause I'd be most feared
See, it's more convenient to leave me alone in the background
Blacked out, in a basement with a gagged mouth
I ain't want nobody to save me, I'll hack out
Shawshank redemption, no thanks to mention
Act now, get a special deal on the raps out
For free 99 I'll beat 99 acts down
But leave one please, I need a comedy track clown
Your beats jokes relief, hope you finally go that route
If thee is next to Tsidi don't act out
I'm a phe-no-me-non, 
retarded don like my mommy done crack (wow)
A super jerk, call me Clark Kent at sperm bank with girl mags
I'd be like SPIT if I burned tags
I burn flags, burn, man, not books or bras, fam

You Don’t Know,The Official Bootleg,2003,"Black people raise up, anger management cases to the front line
Your day's up, children, I hope you didn't quit your day jobs
Been in it, hosting shit like Canadian Asians host SARS
I'm kidding, no really pa, you're fibbing, you rented your car
I'm spilling these phrases like seizure waitresses holding trays
This is greatness, the most endangered species on the playlist
Hey pay this, you fucks
No need to pay for a facelift you sluts
You slept, stupid I'm more dangerous than Michael's face is
I cut through it like a machete's built on my tongue
Leave you stitched up like Eeyore with your teeth all gums, you weak whore
The meek inherits now, but I speak veteran prose
Like I'm Tom Cruise in a wheelchair with my pants all sewn
Now how many times do I need to explain
You faggot Hannibal Lecter niggas, you all eat brain
I will damage your whole system, hack into your mainframe
Crack your bones like I'm cracking computer codes, I am not playing
I am not done spraying nigga, give me my mic back
Don't ever, ever, ever try some shit even like that
I'm a con artist, a schemer, a dealer, a dope
That you feed to your ears through the speakers and feel it 'til it's leaking out your throat
Teacher, preacher, city-wide spelling champ
Your girl felt it so much, she started doing a bellydance
I'm heavy man, like an ACME safe in a cartoon
I'll drop-catch you man, I'll slam right into your car roof
I'm nasty, the antithesis of this mastery
Keep feeding you and feeding you with buckets of candy
Hand ransom notes to all cops at random
With the planted remote in the throat of the kidnapped grandson
For how many grams, one
Wait 'til they're in range, then pull the little chain
Clothesline them just in time to see the boy's exploding brains
I'm sick, I need help, I climb inside of a track
I tell them, I know what I'm doing those aren't snares, those are slaps
One slap, two slaps, three slaps, four
Then I spaz out and stab - forget what the fuck I was counting for
Don't fuck with me, please I'm asking nicely, back off
Put thumbtacks in my hands and grab your nuts, nigga cough
You don't understand Jean, never in your life seen
A girl with more flow than an Iraqi soldier's canteens
More ignored than a homeless on a train begging for change
More credit due to me than a store that doesn't exchange
In Cali, rip ya mayne, New York, damage ya dog
Get on a plane, la voy aca el encima in Spain
I'm dead wrong, too smart to be beefing with little tarts
Jean turn your scream into murmurs like an irregular heartbeat
Hardly the amateur, can't wait for the album tour
Fall come, I'm bringing the malice straight to your campus floor
Manhandle y'all, in France I'm Jean Van-Damnit
All writing hard like carving the Twelfth Commandment, naw
I didn't skip one cause Biggie penned the eleventh
A moment of silence for all the fallen soldiers in heaven
Now moving along children
I screw with your whole vision like fog in the road, listen
Too hot and you know it, burn like a cock when you go piss
And there's snot in the hole dripping and you gotta go to the clinic
Hey, I'm just guessing
Jean's here to level the playing field
I don't care about your spot or what you got for your record deal
I don't care about your feelings or your marketing gimmicks
I just rap -- been here, you just wasn't ready to hear it
I dropped Attack, critics hollered back with a thumbs-up
Exposing those who didn't -- Oliver Wang, you dumb fuck
Untuck your spine, gun-butt you with a Super Soaker
Make you scream louder than the sound of the background vocals
Choke you with a magazine page, then in a rage
Flip you over like quarters on the back of your arm on Happy Days
I've written about life, I spitted about art
I represent the underground cause they've been with me from the start
No, Jean's not hard now, Jean hasn't changed
I was 18 on the first record, I've just experienced the game
Not a thug, not a drug seller, not a gun shooter
Not a stripper, sex symbol, or anything you're used to
Marketing nightmare, I don't fit into categories
I just rap, make beats and shit and sleep all these stories
All I want is a voice, all the people need is choice
If there's no competition then what is the fucking point
You can't win by default, unless you're scared of a challenge
It's not really a fair game if you don't allow balance

Okay

Let's not play the blame game, I love you
Let's not play the blame game, sure
Let's not call out names, names, I hate you
Let's not call out names, names, for sure

It's really easy to say it over this Yeezy beat
More complicated, intoxicated through Greasy's teeth
I wanna tell you both to free my mind and free the speech
But when I wanna say I love you, only evil leaks
I speak mean and I reason it with a hundred things
Not one the things that I'm uttering when under drinks
Is how I really feel, 
the feelings built a wall up
Skyscraper with every story it gets taller
I'm facing this February with less morals
Less normal, more Nellie Olesen, less Laura
Had it with explorations, less Dora
Less explanations, less mortal
See if I'm less human then depression is avoided
So if I'm lessening you then the stress of it is voided
If I'm questioning who's been in your bed I'm annoyed at
Any answer given so what is the point?
Ah doy, at that
I used to call back and cause pain
To call names, text til my batteries all drained
Nameless anatomy next to me all frame
Add lust and mix and fill it up all the same, this
Can't go on forever so I'll play the plagiarist in this endeavor, change the words from Mr. Legend, let's not play the blame game
That shit's forever less than anything we ever were and I don't get regrets no matter how the rest occurred

Let's not play the blame game, I love you
Let's not play the blame game, sure
Let's not call out names, names, I hate you
Let's not call out names, names, for sure

Right... We were really on the same side
At some point you rolled strange die
Double sided, Trouble written on this game, I
Can't play Sorry anymore, that aim is tired
I give up on winning, you in them women, live it
If you ain't in them women, shit really nothing different
You gotta call it quits when it's splitsville
Or continue to bicker with niggas shit still
Nothing moved, nothing gained, everybody's hurt
Fuck it, everyone's to blame, hope everybody learns
Sometimes I sit and study your name with other words
So one of these days it'll blur with others unrehearsed
The ""he said, she said,"" please man
Y'all fueling it with energy like Keyspan
No more, not me fam, 
we was something 'fore The Nothing came and ended us we began

Let's not play the blame game, I love you
Let's not play the blame game, sure
Let's not call out names, names, I hate you

Aimed back at the tenants, my face crack in a venomous rage
I really wanna blaze all you, burn you like 8 whores do
Hurl you like Florida storm furniture

Pardon the phoenix I mark you plus I bark the meanest
Hardly elitist, I know the struggle
I mostly bubble underground like a soda below some broken rubble
At ground zero, I get down nigga, like them brown people

I'll levitate the scriptures just so I can see 'em better
Each and every letter was conceived by Jean I'm the Coretta
Scott King of my day I mean, standing by my mate, my king
Planning for Jamaica honeymooning, vacationing
Cd breaking in, skipping on this track like I've been scraping it
Scraping it, scraping it, bring it back
Sicker than rap. I'll stick you with a picket axe
Pick up your soul and then control it whats bigger than that?
You don't like the way I flow? ""She needs more emotion""? No
I'll give you emotion its you holding your broken nose
And leave you comatose with a pound of Columbia snow
At your side when the cops arrive, they'll just say you overdosed
This ain't a battle, I would make your cranium rattle
Skull in pain as if a hundred veins had popped a dangerous madam
The Heidi Fleiss of words, like a verse, find a purse
I could make you love me if you fuck with me violence occurs
New York pimp game the worst chick since the birth of the words
That I first met on a Thursday I think I'm cursed
Don't blink niggas, cause I will figure
A way to kill you in a second with my ring finger
Think quicker, my visions multiplied like liquor drinkers

Yo Gabba Gabba's show, when I'm in town the ambulances show
Word evangelist, diabolical vandalist
Infamous, Maya Angelou with Marlon Brando shit
Cantankerous as kangaroos on angel dust

I'm out of order, got restraining orders? Wait, your honor!
He made me do it, I'm a angel, check my face, I'm honest
I make electric chair music
I dare you music

I'm a legend, call John, nigga ask him
And every motherfucker's taking bronze rapping
With Jeannie on a track it's really leaning to harassment
Am I wrong class, NO
I'm an original iconoclast, monotone
Monochrome clothes, 
with her mama's ass
Sly Stone, Everyday People
Colon comma dash
That's a profile of me as an emoticon
I know it's clever baby, because I wrote the song

I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
That's right, now come on
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Now come on

Every day I'm unmistakably high-er
You would think I had some coke or mary jane
On my rider, nope
Only dope is fire up is blokes that I rival
Even though they mostly hate the quotes they know they inspire
I'm too dope to retire
I'm too broke to be tired
I'm supposed to be flyer, not remotely weak either
Climbing over these liars laying lower each lineup
Rhyming over reason
 find her praying rosary kind of, like
Miners, Chilé
Divine bust, really
The rhymes blessed, dressed as the madonna
With frilly, ruffled black lace gloves
And tucking a macmilly, in her clutch bag actually
What's so bad? Blasphemy?
Kill me then, silly
I'll sell more records, and
Still be getting busy
The afterlife beckons with the cash I reckon
Maul y'all like wrecking balls, y'all better recognize
Bad when you see it y'all

I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Now come on, that's right
I rock on and on and on and on
And the niggas ain't leaving til six in the morning
I rock on and on and on and on
Now come on

The Jam,The Orchestral Files (Deluxe Edition),2008.0,"All right, let's get down to business
Pour out some Guinness
Khrysis, get on the jack and tell them they're so finished
Christ to the Jesus, the Jeanius came back as a Phoenix
9th like, ""Yo Jean, I got some heaters""
Well, I got some lines that turn grown men
Back into the fetus position with they penis pissing
Didn't mean to be the meanest spitting
It just happened, you know?
Like getting drunk and then you slip and you're cheating (oh!)
It's been a crazy year -- brought back the doorknockers
Baby hair, one sleeve up like Slim Shady's gear
I'm writing with Afeni's baby work ethic
Plus I'm Aileen Wuornos... minus the murder record
Plus I'm highly unconcerned -- you can find me, mouth turned
Like the smiley up on AOL (you're a fucking nerd!)
Fuck it -- so? You fucks with it, though
The structureless flow
The seemingly haphazard, really exact patterns
So Jean is Jean Travers, y'all is just jackasses
By and large, the fact of the matter that I'm in charge, that rapper
That's accurate, spectacular, fantastic
Scrumtrulescent, uncontested funky, bitch

You all steppin' cause this is the fucking jam
People turning the beat up, my people clap their hands
My niggas keep truckin', my ladies throw up your hands
Dance to the record, just dance to the record girl
You all steppin' cause this is the fucking jam
People turning the beat up, my people clap their hands
My niggas keep truckin', my ladies throw up your hands
Dance to the record boy, dance to the record boy

I need a private insane asylum to grant asylum to me
It could get violent quickly if you don't believe me, God forgive me
An honorary anonymous superstar
Followed by the very time I salute where the stupid fall
A low road, but no going back
Not when you've got a fucking logo in the promo rack
Signing records, taking pictures -- you can no-no that
Gotta finish, gotta win; as God as my witness, I'm in...
And y'all'll have to jump me out of this bitch
I'm talking Eastsiders, Westsiders, Blood-ers, and Crips
All them Decepts, at least three sets and grips
And I'll reset -- until then, it's recess, bitch
So c'mon",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-the-jam-lyrics
Going Crazy,This Week,2004,"{*harmonizes*}

Walkin' down a dark alley, shook as a bitch, lookin' behind me (shit)
I'm paranoid, heart beatin' like clips that unload fast
And click 'til you drop in a ditch
And get colder by the moment while you moan and you twitch, oh
Somebody's followin' Jean
Now somethin's creepin' up 'tween the shadows and the city lights
And it's mean
I can't sleep no more
Can't eat, can't keep food inside of my jaw
Pardon me y'all
I feel it in the air like I'm Phil Collins
The whole problem is ill, my first instinct's to get violent
I can't see it clearly, God wished me safety
If He ever appears then please just God take me
I'm hearin' words spoken when I'm turnin' off the lights
Feelin' hands chokin' my neck, provokin' me to fight
Jean's lost it, sweet Jesus, mind's been accosted
In prison and these visions and yo, I can't come off it
Oh God

I think I'm goin' crazy
Oh Lord I'd wish you'd save me
(Oh God) I can't keep runnin'
Please, somebody save me

And I'm Bushwick, punchin' the ground
 
and Willie D's
Holdin' me down to my knees while I'm poundin' my teeth on the street
Until my backbone is splittin', everything bleeds
Man I need help or counselin', somethin'
How about I Ed Norton it? Find a support group
Start frontin' like I been afflicted with sickness
Just witness some pain, get some sleep, and just maybe
I'll kick this
Insane cliques of dangerous agents from ""The Matrix""
Invadin' brain space
I need a refill of pills, I hate this
Gats'll hold me back from smashin' my grill
And equal package of holdin' nerves back from they will
I'm backtrackin' through the nightmares
Fight tears, 
drown beers like I'm Norm avoidin' Vera in 
Cheers
Much older then years
I'm still runnin' from 'em, all fears, runnin' runnin'

It's a Rockwell song, niggas are watchin' me through my cell phone
I can hear the tappin' through the dial tone
They track me, hack me, somebody's gonna get me hectic now
My neck twitch and muscles stay restless
Brain patterns scattered, hectic hexes on the mind
(where they at?) Suspected everyone I ever met
Better yet lately I've been thinkin' I'd been better dead
Put a bullet hole inside my fitted cap and call it end
The story's ill because the motherfuckers never let up
My mental thrills cuz my Spidey senses always get up
I let off, I let go
I lick shots so they know that I fight
My neighbors call the cops every night (shit)
I won't answer the do' cuz I'm scared
And the dro just won't help but I smoke just to get me right
I see 'em creepin' in the dark, comin' for me
Demons on my terrace and menace in the shadows, I'm scared nigga

I think I'm goin' crazy (uh huh)
Oh Lord I'd wish you'd save me

Flew in the door, and the door marked 9
I marked time on the watch says

Style Wars,This Week,2004,"Man, I pray y'all still
Catching the heat, spill
Mash in your grill and potato smash and your caps peeled—feel it?
Like a teen under bleachers
Valley girls, pep rally cheerleaders
Sluts named Sally 
either
You're brain-dead or your veins pump nothing
If you ain't saying Jean's bumping, name ain't puffing
Suckas rain-ducking.  You'll be running, your frame tucked in
To the pain like I'm Wesley in the King—say something, nukka
Fuck you and the mayor
Dunk on you like a Rutgers player, cut abrupt your layup
I got a luxury layer that needs bucks to pay up
So when I jux y'all, I'm aiming for the cummerbund layers
Son of a gun, she's a hundred-and-one tons—heavy
Chase paper like my momma done named her hon ""Chevy""
Cornflakers.  I'll roofie tall
Like I'm handballs and lose you in a booth or stall
You're a lukewarm goof-off with loot galore
And I'll poop scoop your fans and shoot them all
I give a damn, I'll abuse the law
Get Judge Mathis in a blindfold, feed him wine, lead him to traffic—awwww
 (x2)
We don't have to bust rounds to shut the club down
She'll come for you, hunt ya punks down like blood hounds
Ayyo, it's Jean to the Grae—we like, ""What the fuck now?!?""
Cups up—now chug it down, then spread some love around

Triple-6 soul with a gold wiffle bat
That I hold... and a sickle pole, taped to my back
You fold.  Your hands not fucking with mine
It's just sucking your own dick like I'm tucking your spine
Cry me a river, nigga.  They'll find you in Ipanema
Tied to a line with a leech in your liver
On a beach with a bitch from the song, grinding limes
And your smashed teeth, laughing, while you're screaming and crying
Loose-lipped, who figured this chick'll be
So obtuse with it to flip it this way (Hey!)
My mind sharper than a fucking switchblade—lick me
Don't fixate on a picture, nigga—switch page
I'm Daft, Punk.  Stab you with a catheter
With an open pen, then put the cap right back in ya
You're tappin' a life.  You ain't attackin' it right
I go platinum with no dough and half of your life, dummy

We don't have to bust rounds to shut the club down
She'll come for you, hunt ya punks down like blood hounds
Ayyo, it's Jean to the Grae—we like, ""What the fuck now?!?""
Cups up—now chug it down, then spread some love around

Listen up: I'm Cisco mixed with whiskey
I know the security—they won't frisk me
I'm made of material that bounces off
Your mouth talks of the foulness, crowds you walk.  When it
Deflects back and it hits your limbs
'Til your reflexes slack and you kick up ya tims
It's all personal
Maybe when I'm pulling your purse strings
Cut your life short like nurses at birthings
Curse you with one less finger than Oprah
To Danny Glover in purple, your purpose is over
No soldier could stop it—war's 'bout to be poppin'
I'm like a broken faucet.  You should just forfeit—you lost it
Stick a fork into you—you're done
Niggas with a spork in they lungs, walk awkwardly—I'm warning you
Before you could step to the death of you
Nerve of you—talking shit with Jean right next to you
I'm restless.  In one second, I could arrest you
Wait, I'm giving lessons on what the best can do
Catch you hiding in a darkened vestibule
Slit your neck open from your chest—who's next to duel?

Imagine,Cookies or Comas,UnKnown,"Everybody wants to be loved, so we -
Try again, try and get some company thugs
Like we work there, like we -
Are punking the system, getting jerked there
For the workload, and at your worst low
You reverse-breathe, forget your birthright
Forget your own worth, forget the first night
That you discovered how beautiful this art is
When you embarked on your journey to depart this
Normalized, formal-ass, formalized world
But to form your last words is, ""The world"" -
Is mine, is just the perfect line for us
Get us all, Scarface'd up
The relation of coming from nothing to everything
Does explain us, got nothing to do with drugs (in most cases)
Heart crises seem more superfluous
So it's the curse of us,
 and fuck dating us
Cause we some crazy motherfuckers, our natures
Don't call for being reined in more places
Than everywhere, bury it here, your pride, c'mon
Got nothing to lose, got nothing to prove
I define my place as homeostasis
With Chromeo bass riffs and ""Homey don't play this""
But no, we won't play this, 
with tonys and geishas
With Kick-Ass and Hit Girl, lonely ovations
With phony oasises, Romeo playlists
Chrome to your faces (?)
Urban legend like a Chupacabra with the blah-blah
I know I don't exist, mute la palabra
Mutant demi-god, Zeus said that I was half-Artemis
Or maybe Aphrodite -- haven't lived half of my life, B
So I haven't decided yet who's inside of me
Pause--everything
And I don't really want to choose anything
If I have to; semi-automatic wedding ring
To shoot through these blues with a dude who
Makes the days less fuckery-infused
I'm trying to tell your people to fuck with this cruise
You just want tomfoolery
And I'm not who you are, or who I used to be
I'm not every day, I'm not usually",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-imagine-lyrics
My Crew,The Official Bootleg,2003.0,"My family dream with me under city lights
Pump the lighters, scream it’s righteous, work it out, but y’all ain't hearin' it
Words travel deep in your spirit alone
I cruise the block and use the box to serenade the moonlight with the speakers
Niggas lean back deep in your seats and feel me
Cliques and crews in hoods and gangs who love it, I'm lovin' you dearly
Keep hustlin', jugglin' pressure, life, and success
Those who made it debate it until another's deaf
We buried ourselves under the jail without shovels and dirt on our nails
Bubbles with crime and trouble tales and street violence turned extreme (Calling out names)
To rippin' joints on stage to cuttin' fame time short
To life-supportin' none but just realize what y’all done
We've given 'em reasons to scream on us and it's just begun
What happened to us in the bigger picture?
Don't you understand when one of us falls—step—we're all fallin' with ya?
C'mon (Yeah)

If you believe in us, then we will believe that
(All I need is the love of my crew)
(Yeah, all right)
Then maybe you will do what you're supposed to do and you can say (Y’all can’t hurt me)
You're better than this

I represent for a nation.  Thought we was in it together
But I guess it gets strange when money rains in sunny weather
Tougher than leather?  We're weaker than glass
And shattered on the side of the road.  Try to get a ride, but pass each other fast
The closed aves throw hash, ice, and whips
Have blinded us.  Never mind how the mind just trips for glitch
Shit, niggas.  Rich niggas got us in tow
If it's not enough, they gotta put us all on a show
Y’all lost me somewhere between waking and coffee
That shit changed so quick, I didn't blink and it cost me
Fuck it, it costs us.  You even know where we at?
Fucked with you.  I hear that we can't even open the map
Rap's dead, rap sucks, but thanks to y’all for killin' it
Grillin' it down and spillin’ its guts and fillin' it back up with trash
Wait up… I mean cash
But ain’t the two synonymous with media politics?
(You know they love it)

If you believe in us, then we will believe that
(All I need is the love of my crew)
(Yeah, all right)
Then maybe you will do what you're supposed to do and you can say (Y’all can’t hurt me)
You're better than this

What y’all fightin' for?
For the light of the raw battle?  Naw
Can't be the latter ‘cause music just doesn't matter, right?
Maybe I'm pitchin’ emotions to broken ears
And livin’  in years when shit was spoken clearly without all the bullshit
Pulling clips, replacing kings with court jesters
Bought pressers, proclaimed the best is paid and just forsake the rest
Who made it possible to be spittin'
If you got the same type of us women grinnin', then your joint’ll keep spinnin'
I swear it's like swimmin' with sharks in public pools in shallow water
And some of these artists is fuckin' your youngest daughter
Feel me?  Ain't no real fam—niggas is playin’ you
Trust me—I wouldn't let my brother have his way with you
I'm only stating facts—shit is plain as flood lights
We drop ten.  I wanna fuck you, maybe two, one mics
I'm just tryna keep it done right—want some unity
I want our crew to be just like it used to be

If you believe in us, then we will believe that

Mask.,jeannie.,2014.0,"Man, the things you learn in this world deserve space, their own orbits
The pleasurable, the most morbid
No post-posting your destiny til you're post-mortem
But I guess I'm mostly post-modern in my theorems though
 a lot,  in moderation
But my moderation's higher than the average human
I choose to use imagination more than normal
I'm dreaming right now, I teleported you through portals
Supported with the thought that thoughts become things in an instant
An instinct is to think fast
When you blink, you wait for impact
You blink and Jeannie been past
No blockage and no impasse
Cannot is not in this class, no Ramadan is this fast
I won't promote a groupthink
Emote so much I leave verbatim in the booth, thick
And I would never use this music to abuse things
I just want motherfuckers to do things

Take your mask right off and
Show me your face
I love you
There is a place for us
Promise I'll keep you safe
And show me your
Show me your
Show me your

Show me your

There's nothing wrong with the chinks in your armor
Character building like your damages, sans for drama
And if you're dealing with your issues, bonus
But cannot deal with them with you -- I know you're mostly a loner
But I'm alone in it too, holding your shoulder
And I would like to hold it all if you're feeling the moment
Though we could see where we're going
Pursuing something that's beautiful
I'm a hopeless romantic
I hope this doesn't do damage to all the friendship we're building
I never claimed to be coping
And even keeping closed my , a door that's usually open
Cause you're unusually focused, and that's the nail in the coffin
That I've been laying and loving, just waiting here in the dark
Want to tell you but can't
It's steady killing me softly
I just orbit you often
You're amazing, but fuck it
I keep rejection at bay and my feelings graciously tucked in
Wanna say I want your name to form a suffix",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-mask-lyrics
Before the Summer Broke,Gotham Down Deluxe,2013.0,"I spent about a half'a month
Thinking about the universal laws of karma, bullshit
And all that everybody really wants
To contrast to what they need will make you fuckin’ want to fuckin’ pull clips
From everything you’ve ever seen
Wind it back at half-speed
Just to find the part where niggas lied to you
So check my scene if it applies to you
If not, fuck it; turn it off, bye to you

But anyway, I’m back again
Hope you don't miss me, Black FM
Feet firmly planted in the clouds as always
A sack of dreams deferred, I'll leave em in the hallway
Don’t worry, you won’t have to see em
Coincidence you want the bars, I want my freedom
I guess this is the necessary lead-in
Before the scars, loss, boys, feelings oh gosh
Know when Jeanie be going in on her demons, how far
And not even revealing all the cards
I deal, I dealt with blows beyond the belt, pause
Shit that if I told you, you’d be drinking like myself, god
But I’m all right without a reason to do well, star
My Mama was the last thing I wrote the tales for
Inside I’m tailspinning down with napalm
Strapped to my brain and on my back a flamethrower
Oh, you love it, what you came for
I tell myself that, I don’t really give a fuck what they want
But they paying for it, so pay it forward
Try to think of it like that to save thoughts
I'd be like, I’ll be right back in the same song
Never return and leave the happiest of days more
Cause I don’t get what you be putting me in lanes for
It’s fucking music, what you giving it a name for

I’ve been sayin' everything’s going fine, just takin' some days off
Like everything don’t pay it no mind, been puttin' a face on
But motherfucker, I’ve been goddamn lyin', I’m takin' the grace off
To go back in time, before the summer broke

Well, I guess this is what I aimed for
It's fucking music, what you giving it a name for
I don’t get what you be putting me in lanes for
Never return and leave the happiest of days more
I'd be like, I’ll be right back in the same song
I try to think of it like that, but it seems wrong
Pay it forward, they paying for it
I don’t really give a fuck whatever they want
They love it right, it’s what you came for
I tell myself that, it ain't more
Strapped to my brain, on my back a flamethrower
Inside I’m tailspinning down with napalm
My Mama was the thing I wrote the tales for
I’m all right without a reason, doing well, false
Shit if I told you you’d be drinking like myself, god
How far I got in not revealing all the cards
Oh GOSH
Got Jeanie dishing on her demons
After the scars, loss, boys, feelings
I guess this is the necessary heart bleeding
You want the bars, I want freedom
Dreams deferred, you don’t see ‘em

 Alright alright I'm coming, I just wanna send out
 C'mon
 I just wanna send a couple emails, just gimme a second, I'll be like 5 minutes
 Alright

Whats up vicky
Man I can't believe you wrote to me
The last time that I saw you
You even spoke to me
Remember on 8th street
Chillin' with Peter and he was all this my girl wanna meet her?
That shit was bugged right
Anyway...hummhumm damn is been a long time
I see you're still artistic, talented
Vicky listen
I did some foul shit to you
Even though it's passed
I vow to you apologies a thousand times
How could you, even look me in the eye then
You're a bigger person then I ever was
Or at least I'm trying
I should of never touched 'em
We should of never crushed and
Then straight lied to your face about it
No trace of blushing
But I was young and stupid
Shooting all crooked and keep it fucking up a friendship
For some ass, should of never pursued it
Just wanted to thank you for understanding and reaching out
Love Jean, holla back at your homie, peace, I'm out

P.S. just had to get this offa my chest
I hope you're well, I really wish you the best
And as you can tell i've done alot of growing up
And time goes fast and no sign of slowing up
So if its any consolation karma got me bad
And anything I did wrong I wish I never had
I hope that all this drama we can leave in the past
Please feel free to write back

Hey marshall
I pray to god this is your email
Or else someone is gonna read alot of details
I hope you're doing well, matter a fact I know that you are
Probably married, picket fence, kids, well, best regards
You always had it in you
Motivated, studious, impervious to outside influences that can ruin it
Anyways listen
I tried to reach out before
On the first record number 8, fuck it
It was hardly in stores, 2 days still
I bet you moved far from us
It was a long time ago, about five summers
I just wanted to say I'm sorry, sorry for cheating
Sorry I wasn't honest, it wasn't a good reason
You probably dont care but I still mean it
Still put it in the air and hope that you feel that I'm being sincere
You didn't deserve a broken heart
And I wish you the world
Love Jean, screamalate at your girl


Dear Jean
I see you're doing big things
Congratulations hey I even saw that big ring
Who would of thunk it huh? L-O-L
You even seem content
I notice that you're more focus
Drinking less is well
Anyways its been too many months having henny days
I think is plenty grave, plus you get your penny saved up
And say what?!? second album
Whatever happened to the thought of edging rapping
Still living in Manhattan?
Side tracking note, just on the low
All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
I've acted horribly, and all my pessimism towards your life
Still bothers me
But you're a big girl now
You've fought and made it through
Best of luck homie
And everything I say is true
XOXO space smiley face dot dot dot comma much love, you

Ah cap locks, delete

Ready the cars, fuck it ready the tank, hit the alarm
Trilogy infinity bars
, I'll spit in your mouth
Break in your house, shit on your couch, hit your kid and spouse
Survival shit homey
Driving with a corset made of dynamite sticks on me
Arm me with an army jacket with a pistol in it
I'll just pistol whip you like a bitch, you calling me a bitch?
Your lip is busted dripping crimson on the floor honey
You see it's all fun and games
Until you're falling on my sword gutted to the core buddy
With a 4x4 to your jaw, assaulting your balls with a saw, and some sea salt
Loaded cannon on the other side of a seesaw
With an ""If you see something, say something"" sign (hee haw)
Guitar strings, and a key card with a sharpened end
Will make me carve things in ya deep scars that never mend
But never mind Jeannie right
She's harmless 
calm as condom in a convents quarters
As Common as Lonnie

or women covered in islamic countries
Or conflict in congress
Or in Copenhagen commenting danke
Idiot
I'm unmitigatedly brilliant, bet again
Better go back the to beginning Fezig, Finnegan
Put in your bid again, bet Grae
Kiss the converse, Leroy
I'll windmill bee boy all over your kinfolk
And I don't mean breakdance
I'll throw a hive at boy
And kick him in a windmill and then spin the damn spoke
I'm Pig Pen but swarming with half notes
Treble clefs, bass clefs, 
half rest as top hat
Delivery legato as fuck
 
and not a libertine who liberally fucks
I deliberately say ""fuck that""
Tongue in the second letter of vocabulary
Make it come and go whenever necessary
Yes nigga I cuffed that
Drink a big cup of Never
Bit of hilarity
If you front the flow I dare whatever ya test
I love that
Bethenny Frankel, slim chance of that shit
I'm Dr Gonzo on constant natural acid trip
My natural state is bat country
Do I want some molly? No ma'am, Al Bundy
Marcy Darcy haircut, Daria attitude
Marty McFly Air mags
, pardon the magnitude
I make references to shit I like
I really don't care if it's a hit on site
I'm not blackpeoplemeet
I spit on mics

Vince Vaughn
And I'll stretch my shit out like Cardiff Giant off a plane
Arcane is an innocuous descriptive of the lane
But Arkham is more accurate and smarter to claim
Wayne manner, not the house, but the same mannerisms
Played out, but without the pain of the slain parental figures
Orphan rap, endorphin rap, 
dolphin rape
Wait… how'd that get in there, aww too late
Orphan Black, multiple characters, same actor Jean
With a St. Patrick's Day theme, drink
An almanac of culpable narratives, in back of me
With a quaint braggish Grae lean
Blink, and you'll probably miss it
But I'm glad well you listened
And that the fans who get it
Whenever damn well they spread it
If it's thin as pancetta you do could it damn better
I'm like the Whoville anthem and their mascot forget it
Imagine Bambaataa in Calcutta in 76
With a Cosby sweater on
That's how hot I am
Then imagine Dorothy Parker in Alaska in 1926 sitting a bar
That's how hot I am
Also
Many levels of hotness
My pineal gland is on a vacation topless
Cut me, I bleed agave.
 That's obnoxious
Why would you need to cut me just trust me, it's a process
I could build your confidence
Also be your accomplice (laughs)
I couldn't say that with a straight face I'm way too honest
I'll push you in the Gowanus for nothing
I'll punch you in the vomit button
I'm kinda like Rick Moranis but with Vigo in him (Vigo)
I'm from the land of Cry Freedom (Biko)
I probably would have fucked Mc Lovin
Yipee-ki-yay John McClane
I don't die hard
I don't Dylan
I'll never die at all
I get dye jobs, for sticking up dive bars
And making the old guys lick up the whole stripper pole
And make 2 sidecars, side bars

RIP,Cookies or Comas,UnKnown,"Make your movie in HD, bet you it ain't a saga
Me, I'm a slinger; you a singer like Lady Gaga
I could see through you 'bout as clear as Ciroc Vodka
Knock out your teeth with the back of the mic proper
I don't give a fuck about a chopper
Leave you in the doctor; I-Pod filled with Big Poppa
Make sixteens I call Oscars for actors
Get in your neck and your back like chiropractors
I'm so nice I could give you a fact backwards
""Out hardest the is Ghost"", keep your kids close
Sick when I was nine years old, ask my kinfolk
My people been broke, a couple been rich
If rap was jail, I'd be running the whole pen, bitch
Ghost, Talib and Jean Grae
X-Men of hip hop, and still rock harder than Green Day
Classic like vinyl but let the machines spray

Come on peel a bill off the knot, in ya pocket
Be a super star at the bar, we 'bout to lock it down
Got green in the black sacks of chocolate
Stop it, before you say something that's out of pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket
Rock, rock, drop it in the pocket

(Get your rock out of my pocket, nigga!)
No it's not...like Charlie Brown who got a {ROCK!}
In his pocket trick or treating, I mean I'm a medium
For leaking heat, a freaking genie, Jean's a genius
You idiots, I'm mean to you, sweetie and I'm a queen
I don't swing open like Lamborghini doors do -- whores do
My job is to floor you, block you and ignore you
Pop you like a blocked call, I'm like Rockmore
You watching me like Rockwell's pop song just popped on
(Your lockjaw's a good thing) I'm glad I put the hammer to it
My handlers will handle this (Ma'am, she didn't do it)
Yeah, what they said, don't want no arraignments rocking round
That would be worse than K-Fed doing ""PopoZao""
Right in my momma's house with his little rocket out
Jesus! Wet my fingers and just stick 'em in the socket now (Please)
I'd rather be dead than watch wack shit
Color me gone, fill in the dirt, tell 'em I kicked... ten buckets
And it's all your fault, I'm rotting
Shouldn'ta done that, lied about rocking
Huh, it's all your fault I'm rotting
You shouldn'ta done that, lied about rocking


What is it? ... What, is you tryin to lose your life?
Ancient wisdom like Druids but I'm foolish on the mic
Flow the truest, undisputed cause I do it how I like
It's the crack so the fiends' lips is bluish from the pipe
Nice try, you ain't fly, you lying on the ProTools
Yeah, your vocals mighta flew but you local like Q
Applying these old rules to new dudes don't work
Even though they softer than yogurt, and covert
If you don't work you don't eat
You fuck around and get higher than a nosebleed seat, try to compete
Ya done beat yourself before ya even started
E'rybody knows you don't go full retarded, bogus artists
Rock the stage, you going off the page and making no sense
The way I do these rappers so ugly the flow is grotesque
Your flow is Kotex, it's no contest
You a foe, unidentified flying object",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-rip-lyrics
A-Alikes,This Week,2004.0,"Well if she rocks like a spitter, and she flows like a spitter
Then you know she’s a spitter, and she probably is
And if she walks like a spitter, and she talks like a spitter
Don’t floss please forgive her, she probably is
And if she writes like a spitter, hold the mic like a spitter
Pause boys, ain’t no gutter, you know that she is
And if she rhymes like a spitter, know she rhymes like a spitter
Who rhymes like a spitter, you know who it is
A burnt sky scorched the earth’s flesh
At the same time the murderous text arose
Like a phoenix with the glow of death
A poet two steps ahead like Noah just left
Mo’ and sex holding techs
No, I’m not what you’d expect
Golden pen, exposing men false
Like a fallen disciple, All in the bible
The cause is the calling haiku
The love of words language liquor phrased
Slang in Mecca raised skyscraper
Look a future brighter then your jewels of praise

This life must be what divorce caught be like
I fall apart right just to stay right
Call this caught like night calls to daylight
We a-alike see alike but you don’t hear me though (you don’t hear me though)
When everything else just don’t go right, even if we just pretend that we alright
Call this caught like night calls to daylight
We a-alike see alike but you don’t hear me though
For lack of better words, well that’s actually the worst
The vernacular must map first a path of better verse
Heads are cursed I rap backwards
Like a roll, backwards
Flip the same line another track yes, accurate
I’ve mastered it, fucked rhymed
Killed it’s father, bastardized it
Masqueraded, I roll drive by and patronize it
Must analyze it slow, mathematical
Crack addicts pull
My rock will take you high, like astronomical planes
The money changes hands this year
With this here lisp, you disappear
My bliss is ripping spheres of discs
The wax heatedness, bleeding black blacker
Dreaming of a Caddie, black leather seated
Beats banging, heat ?
Serial scratch Nina, police tracking us all
Side track ‘em in an alley and laugh at the law
You see my way of doing things is sort of different
Never resort to riffing
I just snuff and keep it stepping, listen
Heavy stomp like I’m gravity in hand smashing the floor
Splashed jagged, shrapnel slap in your jaw
I’m like Bill’s wife packing a sword
You must be outta your gourd
The girl’s insane but I told you before

Irrational thoughts often, but find me squeezing the cork often
Competing with wino heathens to squeeze in a coffin
The alcoholic in me’s almost slaughtered like the traveling door to doorsmen
Who was found in doors with the foreman’s daughter Lauren
I freak a little forward, speak a little proper grammar
Rapper with the capital R, back with no capital
Fact is I’m hazardous, Angela’s hell immaculate
Poem’s rap like I’m in an obsessive compulsive cabinets
Neat but still dirty, elite but still worldly
To peak maybe at 30, I speak that I ain’t worthy yet
So grab your drinks and toast them up to the future

Before I go Manson and your man's dead

My paws grubby, greasy
Don't drink Riesling or Moscato, that's a dessert bottle
Stashed up in the purse vodka
Blasted in the afternoon, hostile. Trashed up in a fancy room ...
Hostels- You in
Impostors ruin, the movement of the realest motherfuckers that do it
But I'm Mama Large Marge, you're just Pee-Wee truckin' through it
Pursue her, good luck; I'm fluid as fuck
I move like a loose screw point, hunt
Fast and agile
Teleport rhymes
Nightcrawler while you're fragile, stagnant ballers
Don't give a damn about your dollars: ignore it
I don't give a damn about your problems: you're boring
What I utter, just utterly in the throes of the gutter and mixed with a dose of the beautiful struggle

Billy Killer,Jeanius,2008,"Each morning, my man goes downtown
Where everyone falls, and he's lost
In an angry land, he's a little man

9 A.M., eyeing him
My eyes widening
Feeling like it's Groundhog Day, he gotta try again
Riptide tide with thoughts of retiring
Pride flies and he wired me some truth and inspirement
So I can't fail him
He gets the mail and he's off
Like a movie trailer with those long roads and it costs
I wish you could retain the way he's losing his patience
Fucking transit, travel constantly, the fame motivation
Check cashing day, knowing my face on the spot
The bank teller should embrace him when he talks in slots
And not a day of rest, he walks twenty blocks
And brings me what the villain's got
A little money, little presents I could kill 'em rock
Ready stalking with them, having dark visions of choking 
And fuck , but of course it's his job
And he can't understand why I worry so much
Because he's my man, damn


He's busting his ass like figure skaters falling
Discussing the past label problems,  calling him
It's my drama he's falling in; my momma, she stalling him
He's running out the door and she's saying, ""Go to the store,"" and then
He's rushing out on no food
I feel him getting close to postal
Getting robbed by a nigga for ProTools
And he won't tell me about  in Tennessee
I swear that nigga's dead -- I could picture the funeral, B
Hollering like soon he'll be picking jewelry
I be like, if I was you, I'd be excluding me
He won't go; he smokes, though, just to get by
They fuck up his high with phone calls
I swear to God, I wish he'd snap
Run up in , stab [

And flip the table over, take his wallet, kick his throat in
And leave the knife attached to a note, smoking


Man, fuck

Colin ran around for a month and niggas ain't calling
I hate him going to these meetings, trying to explain
Why Jean is the next thing; I fiend for the ending
I scream when he's leaving, man, I hate them
He doesn't write no more; drawings, he doesn't make them
Pause, we the relation; calls heeded, forsaken
All Colin's creative; Lord, how does he make it?
Naw, I couldn't, maybe, cause Jean's not as good at
Bottling up feelings, feeling all positive when I shouldn't
I'm going with him, bringing some basement to it
In the ass, find a nice place to place my foot in
But he paces my footing, tries to place the good in
Keeps the paper chase going, no complaints
Why shouldn't I worry that what good am I?

Take you out? Do some stuff? Can I take you out tonight?)

Bet you ain't know from the way that I stepped in
The light shown from the second floor down the door that I write, nah
?Ignoring? to the fact that I'm so cute
Boots to the calf ? half top, jeans and a bag
Only thing missing is the ring on the finger
Partying single, getting drunk like Steve Buscemi in The Wedding Singer
Now I need somebody next to me dancing, handsome
Love his mama, no drama, 
don't need a mansion
Trust, I need romancin' plus a weekend camping trip
We could go half on a cabin in that sh--
But Jean don't ski, and neither does he
So we lamp in the hot tub ?switching? it all passion

Now you're fronting like Cupid ain't shot ya, Jean's gotcha
All giggly on the phone, your tone's softer
We ain't even bone and the and the zone it just grows closer
Dinner, movies, the backseat, arm on my shoulder
Ask me, questions, now we're talking relations past
Laughing at the stories and my lack of patience, you
See the drama got you on not dating
Cause the home training lacking in these hoes so you waiting
For a girl who ain't crazy, smarter than the average lady
Ambitious, but still get high, analyze Jay-Z
Smiley faces every time he IM's me
Either brother's a winner or the prize box is empty

I want you back
I want you, boo
Though we ain't loving
We ain't fucking
We ain't through

Sometimes I want you back just to adore you

Insane to explain, I know it might sound callous
Careless, sadist,

Stain your frame of painted veins I bust with cutlery
It's such a shame that you think you're an accessory
You're so fucking pedestrian, especially when you're next to me
Excuse me, sounding too imposing
Fuck it, I'm first class -- I never said I was into coaching
You should listen closely, thinking the song's about you
It is -- you, him, him, and him mostly
Don't choose bad; at times, my choices do betray me
Belaboring the point, yeah, maybe I'm sort of faded
""I'll maybe call you later, baby""; Lord, you're hated
But Lord, of course I'm motivated, low-key hatred
Sleeping neighbors choose euthanasia
Stay together, trooping through the universe forever
I'd rather not be two sedated dapper cadavers
I'd rather feel the pain and tell you never feel embarrassed
It ain't baggage -- I claim baggage like a name tag
It ain't marriage if the gain came through the same fabric
Insane to remain average, I can't have it
My main habit's to change, it creates havoc
You can't fathom a love/hate relation, well
Yes you can, guess again -- you've been aceing them
Replacing them with lying to yourself or fifty pacing them like
Let's get through it, baby
And maybe I'm crazy then for being blunt
I know what I deserve, know what I want
I know that we could never really be a pair
I know that sometimes I still want you there
I might not like you, our connection's rare
I might just spite you, you're never there

My Story (Please Forgive Me),UnKnown,UnKnown,"If I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back
I write that, but infinity can't rewind facts
You are divinity
My primitive mind was struggling
Just to understand the meaning of life, forgive me
I never told my mommy, I couldn't break her spirit
She always wished her daughter, extraordinary thinking
So I traveled alone, young, sixteen got in the habit of not stayin' at home
Doing the sad walk like
Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty
Trips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me
I couldn't eat shit. I fainted frequent. On cold floors and I pause and I think, Peep it
I'm lost, my four friends know
And just fuck at the boys' apartments for rent, so
I'm all wishin' that it's a dream ending soon
I've actually erased a lot that I've been through
See when the rain comes down, I know it's fallin' for me, and only for me
And when the pain comes around, there's nowhere else I rather would be
I know what I've done, Please forgive me
Now all my bitter homies sayin' that's what men do
Feelin' retarded for seeing partner potential
On top of that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur
I can't take it; I'm contemplating a glot burner, a cop murderer
I can't be, this can't be
The tears streaming and I can't see, they lance me
And I'm passin' out, and this is just for blood
They had to cover the mass amounts, I've had enough
And you don't know what it's like in waiting rooms
And outside their picketing pictures could slay you
Their screamin' victims, and spitting till they shame you
I hold my head low and shiver push my way through
They put you in a room, where you can change into
Your gown and shower cap, shaking as a feene would do
And tha's when you think of leaving, fleeing the building and then they call you and you hear the call of your children
They count down from ten now, you wanna stop 'em but you say it in your head, your out for the cut
Then you wake up in another room with plenty others
They call it recovery; you're thinkin' we ain't mothers
And then prescription pills, written a 'scrip with chills
An understatement, you're dressed but you're naked still
And your brain won't think straight
Wait - Can't finish this
See when the rain comes down, I know it's fallin' for me, and only for me
And when the pain comes around, there's nowhere else I rather would be
I know what I've done, Please forgive me
I kept it bottled up; my parent's found the pills
Screaming God what have you done?
Cried till I snotted blood, then got a gun
My temper ran quick tho, from the thought, then the worst I was caught in the same place
A year later, for me that's when hatred started
My faith martyred, I've dated a father but farther, then I moved on
Years past, the guilt's worse and it builds till your heart' smashed
Then I miscarried 22 age, I was headed to a breakdown
Swallowed up some pills and I laid down
I was a failure at that too, bailed from the rap then but fate took me back in
Sin is a tattoo my fingers attached with
Twenty-seven with three kids that I never met
What if I was Catholic? Wonder if they hate me?
Thinking how their mother could ever murder?
Well take me hell - to the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly
I gave a monstacy
How could I possibly correspond with God when I gave the authority to end that life?
But it's never over, even if we have a child
They coulda had a brother or sister or both
I'm thinking about another life that almost got close
Prayin' that in another time we coulda' changed posts
If I could just reverse time, I would
I don't know what I would do, honestly it's not good
I'm sorry",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-my-story-please-forgive-me-lyrics

 (Watcha say, watcha say now?)
Supa Luv (Supa Luv baby, Supa Luv baby)
Supa Luv (It's Supa Luv baby)
(Come on.  9th Wonder)

Well you see
I was a skeptic, hesitant, even when he said
(She's the closest thing to an angel I've ever seen)
Uh huh, yeah right
I've heard that line before
It always carried some ill intent for sure
But then he said it some more
Pretend I've never been in love, I'm not getting sprung
But I could miss it—he could be the one
No one better and he could make me believe that
(She's a lady to the extreme)
About Jean, I'm 'bout to
Call my family, be like, ""I met him mom!  Wedding's on!""
Ready to party, but instead I'm calm
Surface, though, all fireworks, wired-up espresso
His expressiveness is in the presence of ever—let's go
Chill in the tropics drinking rum punch, One Love
Singing it over lunch, he got me, love guns out, dunny
My luck's been out, feel me?
It done run south, left me a ton of doubt
It's never fun getting the run-around (uh-uh)
Was never one to be wooed easy, I bruise easy
When dudes leave me I get boozed up, they don't trust me
He freaking speech, though, and I'm drinking ghost lager
A teensy-more-than-moderate feeling you both gotta
Feeling your clothes cause you're appealing and you're really close
Thinking of stashing you up in my pocket, being ghost
Check it, I'm long-legged—we could wreck my dorm mattress
You could be my new partner, heart, baby—my new fetish

A Supa Luv for Jean
Could you be the Supa Luv for me?
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my
(Supa Luv) I need a
(Supa Luv) I want a
(Supa Luv) I gotta
(Supa Luv) Find him

This one's different, though (Oh?)
Step to me dancing, hand in my back pants
And dance in the back, pantin'
Same line, way fine, he from the Cayman Islands
And my waistline he trace, fine and I flutter my eyelids—I'm
Drinking Patron shots—so much the floor shake
Loving every bit of him—he's sputtering the rhythm and
Buttering Grae's ego with the clean-cut pimp-lean
Strutter with the clip clean, gutter slang—""I think I love he!""
Picture us lovely playing games—he's hugging me
Staying engaged two weeks, eloping out the country
He's so special, not a stalk of potential in him
Y'all, did I mention he's a tall drink of water?  Sinkin'
Into me mentally, intensely feeling him
Intentionally sipping Hennessy—let's leave the building
Then we can build more—he's so hot
He could father my children plus he told me I got
(I got a)

A Supa Luv for Jean (Just for me, baby)
Could you be the Supa Luv for me? (That's what I'm looking for)
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my
(Supa Luv)
(Supa Luv)
(Supa Luv)
(Supa Luv)

Hey, hey
What's your name and how you maintain, huh?
(Hmmm...) You don't say a word
I like you too—like to invite you to a party in my pants
Okay, that was just rude—let's dance (sorry)
For seven long hours, spottin' gems, droppin 'em back
Like I'm bleached on the block again, rock—holla! (Holla!)
Pop my collar.  There was the brother with the drop Impala
The hot model—you could spot his pet piranha
Bet I was sweating; you know better—I'm swearing, your honor (I swear!)
I'd never let him get the better of me but the problem:
He's got those words that block my curves
Get my nerves boxed up 'til I'm impossibly slurred.  I gotta
Stop before I vomit.  And if the cops occurred
It would be drama.  And, plus, my warrant's absurd
It's time to go home, go alone, chill, and relax
But wait, there's the first brother grilling me back
(Heyyyy...)

A Supa Luv for Jean (Where's the Supa Luv for me?  Baby, come on)
Could you be the Supa Luv for me? (And I'm going somewhere again today)
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my
(Supa Luv) I want a
(Supa Luv) I need a
(Supa Luv) I gotta find me  now
(Supa Luv) Come on

A Supa Luv, a Supa Luv, it's just a Supa Luv—hey!
Will and Joe got a Supa Luv—hey!
 and Trina got a Supa Luv—hey!
I know some couples with a Supa Luv—hey!
I got a Supa Luv, I got a Supa Luv
I can't tell you 'bout my Supa Luv cause it's not that time of the album yet—keep listening, beotch!
Wednesday.  Wednesday (What day is it, man?)
Yo, it's muthafuckin' Wednesday (Honey, what day is it?)

Take Me,Bootleg of the Bootleg EP,2003,"(Baby) 
Yea, though I walk through the valley
In the shadow of darkness
, praying to God heartless
(Take me) Wake me up, don't forsake me
(Take me) I pray hard, don't leave me waiting, please
(Baby) Yea, though I walk through the valley
In the shadow of darkness, praying to God heartless
(Take me) Wake me up, don't forsake me
(Take me) I pray hard, don't leave me waiting, please

Oh lord, I'm having issues, more deep than American missiles
Shooting commuter planes and filing emissions official
I've hit depression hard and started to pick at the scabs
From the scar, I'm a mess addressing pain in a bar, I confess
Cause all the rest just mar shit, chest in a cast
Feeling urges just to test out a casket, bless me I'm blasphemous
Jesus pass the fifth, I... have to get lit
Masochist self I'm only half of the health I was born with
(Baby) Save me, take me up high like 'dro
But way far past the stars and the sky
I'm blinding pain like I'm a junkie shooting up with
Emotional novacaine, I'm floating provoking the angels to jump me
In layman's terms, faith's been blurred, even early
I scratched crayon in between the holy word I pray on, but still
(Baby) Three gone, and maybe I'm in barren land
God help me, I'm having trouble with your master plan so

(Take Me) the shadows of valleys of death, God
(Take me) when I'm shooting, taking last breaths hard
(Baby) I want to walk through the valleys praying lord
Will you help me, save me God, won't you tell me, tell me
(Take me) Cause I'm losing my faith, bless me
(Take me) Cause this world just wanna test me

You see this dirty knife on the floor, this chrome nine in my hand
These foul thoughts in my conscious, constantly understand
See we taught to believe if you can touch it and see it, it must
Be real so go believe it. But I've never seen Jesus
I've never seen God, so he's only a thesis
And I'm questioning all these things in my time to depart
I know it's written suicide is giving hell and devils privilege
Only wicked heathens commit it, sin of ages, well fuck it, bring it!
Lately I've been waking early mornings screaming
""Save me,"" dreams of seven horsemen chasing Jean, hastening speed
So I'm raising the barrel envisioning marrow
Splashed on the wall and polka dotting all my apparel
And maybe, Ginsu blades through skin will slay
And split thin veins instead of loading clips that spray
And if I'm meant to stay, then I'll just pass through the gates
And fall a long way back to Earth, so why don't you just


You can see the pain twist my face from a distance
The body's windows glistening red hot from all of the indo
Thinking of my next of kinfolk, my mama
Opening doors, crimson billows spread out on the pillows and floor
I gotta block it out. I'm set on knocking out
Lock and aim and I'm dropping my frame quick when I pop in the brain
And if God's omnipotent, will he slip in and change
And move the pistol so it shoots out of range and the lead whistles?
(Baby) Maybe he's just playing; it'll ricochet
And cripple me strictly for questioning, give me life to the pain
Sickle-shaped body bent in the middle
So little kids who pass me harass me and giggle
My figure's itching to touch on the answers
Hard-headed like exotic dancers' nipples
Picturing the bullets ripping the skin on the mantle I'm holding
Pull back and blow the wick right off the candle
Throw a kiss until the world's out of focus
So now (take me)",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-take-me-lyrics
Whatever,This Week,2004,"He already knew I was down for the cause
But 'hard to get' is much more fun
What's better than that really
Son was like feel me
I was all, nah
Catching feelings truly upset when he had to go
And school me on ways of catching a mate, God
I'm matchin' a date cuz I'm lacking skills
And mack is smaller than an iPod
I'm kiddin I know the macking is rules
Was tackin on the wifey latch since backpacking in school
But he's different though I feel him mo
Can't play it simple, No
Can't fuck up the friendship for them dimples, nope
I need to enter his space and probe his Interscope
Just like I'm vanity lookin for his inner glow
He's not a bad boy, I've never sampled his type before
Moved to New York from Los Angeles
Cali Swagger ain't attached to nothing
We puffin' analyzing the city after he's rolling something
I wanna rock a fella so bad, oh man
Note pad's filled with all the ink his soul had
Visions of us kissing the whole nine
No jive, could picture his whole profile
But I can't step, I risk the chance of losing everything
Our friendship is more important than a wedding ring
Now when he's calling me I keep acting shady
And lately screening all his calls to escape he
Keeping my heart safely tucked in but I can't function
Until the aftermath of our conjunctions passed
Punking out, I'm ducking out his way
Can't look him in the face, eyes drippin with game
My mind's trippin again, damn

Maybe it just shouldn't be us two
Maybe I'm just not the one who's right you know
And maybe we can't be together tonight
Or maybe it's just not good
I mean, maybe you need another girl
Maybe I can't just be in your world
Maybe we just can't be together
For you, whatever

I, J. Grae do solemly need this fresh to death man
Even blind girls can see that he's def jam
I'm in this universal problem
Y'all can probably relate, y'all follow then
So do I give my loving to him
Or would that just ruin everything that we're about
I'm so attached to him
He knows the way I am, tempers un-godly so
Domestic violence could turn to me on death row
He's so persistant with it, we're making out again
We double dating, out with one of his Columbia friends
He didn't graduate, so it makes him feel shitty
We leave the place and wonder hand in hand around the city
He leans in kisses me, his g unit shiftly
My mind is misses sweet we moving into ecstasy
His warmth next to me, now we're all necking
Three hours later naked, me laying in his arms affectionate


Well I guess I, I guess I was the one for you
This is beautiful
Just us together forever and ever and ever
Can I get you anything
Do you need some weed
Some back woods
A back rub
A slice of cake
I'd do anything for you boy
Anything, anything
Except for that",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-whatever-lyrics
Swing Blades,Bootleg of the Bootleg EP,2003,"Everyday caught in the whirlwinds
Back in the studio, belief just hurled in
Still tryna get my pen on, write scripts, and light spliffs
‘Til we high as light bills
Watching for those that might switch
To the dark.  We over here, remaining righteous
Though we spark the sole purpose to spit and hype kids
Make them want to hold open their eye lids
Dangers and missed origins from way back since
The presence of Genesis and Osirus
Life is such a stress
But in the coldest storms I let them off in the Phoenix
Make ‘em want to hold open they eyelids
Dangers and missed origins from way back since
The presence of Genesis and Osirus.  Life is such a stress
But in the coldest storms, I let ‘em off in the phoenix

Over a thousand miles of public housing
Lounging on beaches in the Riviera, tan and doused in coconut scented lotion
Wish I was there.  The story rare enough to merit an endangered species
Tagging velvet ropes surrounding every path
I’m tighter than some virgin’s  pussy.  Don't ever push me
I balance on the edge of cliffs for fun and some are hanging crooked
I never look down—I look to the sky
And envision the place where everybody go when they die
They say that bright lights and angels come and get you
If that's the truth, then I expect the black night blocking the sun—I got issues
Another day with myself, another day without wealth
There's gotta be another way—I need help
And so I pray like I'm a Pentecostal, Sufi, Buddhist, strict agnostic
Hoping one will hit its target.  Take another sip of hypnotic
And lay my head on the pillow and dream erotic scenes
Of killers spilling endless rounds and all of them shooting at me

You know Can Ox got that 
Phoenix wing span
And love hovering over the ghetto wasteland
I got rap just as fat as my waistband
You got a rap that belongs in a waste can
Yo, Jean you gotta change Grae to Hackman
‘Cause when we fight, we swing them blades
And when we rap, we swing them blades
And then we slide on ‘em like the escapades
I knew the end of this book since the first page
Rap sucks, but we still get paid
We smokin’ trees of the highest grades
I spit a line that'll fix your fades
So don't go there—you cannot hold Aire
Look at them reaching and shit
If you touch my jersey, I'll bust your lip
Open your face then break your hip",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-swing-blades-lyrics
Negro Baseball League,The Official Bootleg,2003,"Check, check

First batter up, first-first batter up

Now, enterin' the batter's box
Is a guy who wears Champion socks and likes rings with rocks
Throw up my middle finger to the umpire
‘Cause niggas just choosin' the new talent just need to retire
Check the signals from my manager, the first base coach
He's throwin' signs, tellin' me the label's just playin' cutthroat
Yo, I hit him with a tape or should I say I take a check swing?
I hear the crowd sing, go meet Plug, and the telephone ring
He says I need more beats—wait a minute—no doubt
My temper runs out.  Three pitches later, I strike the fuck out
Yo, shit like this happens to the real MC's
Because the labels wanna sign up the commercial wannabes
And if, it ain't that, it's just a little bit more, sayin'
“Umm, can you put on a screwface and scream lyrics that's hardcore?”
I adore this whole rap persona
But some of you A&R's must be mixin' coke witcha marijuana
Talkin', “Oooh, he got the new shit.”
I'm on his dick but that's an MC that come out with one bangin' hit.”
I split atoms, blow up as if I was atomic
Labels talk so much shit, yo, I laugh at them like they was comics
Check the scoreboard—we're up by one
Two more hitters to go, and the song ain't even done, baseball

First batter up, well, here's the pitch, that's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
First batter up, well, here's the pitch, that's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served

From the kids in the batting cages to the pro players
To the labels and the mob in the bleachers makin' waves
Lookin' at the pitcher like, “Man, what gives?”
They got one-arm fugitives throwin' with prosthetic limbs
Look from the team to the umpire means that the
Man got demoted from stadiums to refereein' gyms
Synonyms from big cheese to the independent label
Couldn't pay up they debt, so they got cut like unpaid cable
B. E. I. S. B-O-L, accent on the “O.”  GOALLLL!
Feel sweat tricklin' down the back of my neck
Tighten my grip on the bat, take a swing and it's a technical foul
Nah, that's basketball… Whatever, good call
How come when black men hit the field, they were throwin' bottles?
Now they throwin' million dollar deals?
When I steal bases, I do it with pride
For Jackie Robinson, certified—forerunner for us
Homeruns, we must hit 'em straight out the ballpark
I'm not patriotic, so I won't sing the National
Underlyin' stipulations playing underhanded ways
It pays to have your representative stay
Or you'll have top executives gettin' all possessive
With your money and it's not funny
But when loot is involved, all problems get solved
Umm, maybe because you supply they cocaine fetish
To finish this, this business ain't nothin' but corrupt
Forget all this garbage—I'd rather play tennis

First batter up, well, here's the pitch, that's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
First batter up, well, here's the pitch, that's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served

Baseball was never for Blacks
It used to be a pastime for Whites
Now it has mad Puerto Ricans
But that's not the point of the song
The point of the song and I make it mad simple
When I be flippin' this script
Is that the industry is all over the mound
Pitchin' but nobody's makin' any hits—hmm
Baseball is not just a sport
It's the verbal, mental, physical, spiritual
Emotional level that we are on
It's about time that all you devils was gone
 like .  I said it and meant it
If you cannot handle it, then for your ears it's not intended
You can play the documented, all athletes quoted
‘Cause when you speak to be exploited, then your spot will get exploded
Bases are loaded, but there is no RBI in the stadium
Where players try to be hard as titanium
I got your cranium movin' when I be showin' and provin'
Now you fear that your career is goin' down the tubes
And it'll be along with industry that's withering
And what’s left?  Ocean’s about to blow to smithereens
I bring lyrical formats that you'll admire
And to the Hall of Fame I will go when I retire
They'll set your world afire.  There is nobody to fear
When every umpire, A&R is screamin' that, “You’re outta here!”
And to your amazement, a tax write-off is your replacement
You gotta face it—there is no other crew adjacent
With sounds from the basement, we rise
We energize, to take over the whole enterprise
By now, you realize that when we're in the place
That we will come fat over piano and the bass
If you're lookin' for security, then you can end your chase
Come home to Negro League and you'll be safe
Baseball!

No doubt, Negro League is in the house
No doubt, no doubt, knockin' runs out
‘Cause we do it like this, we do it like that
I was rockin’ stage just like to a bat
Sent to home back when I be doing my thing
Hit a home run with the Negro League theme
Do it like this, do it like that
I was rockin' stage just like to a bat
Sent to home back when I be doing my thing
Hit the home run with the Negro League swing",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-negro-baseball-league-lyrics
The Time Is Now,Jeanius,2008.0,"Intro 
Aye 9th, you know me and Phonte the Ashford and Simpson of this rap shit
Y'all ain't know
Oh, y'all ain't know
Oh, we creeping up like.. da na na na na

It's Jean niggas, back again
Trap you in the wrath again
Blacker than boat loads of Africans
Or rather like them
This struggle, we can't win
Back bent, over till it slacks, and cracks
Can't hustle harder
I'm like my father
Only in denial though
My mother is like ""I know""
And my brother is quiet so
I fight further
Till I type murder, family cycles and fly further than expected
Titles on my life or daughter
Sorta like a boarder
Still in my momma's house
Get green like chlorophyll and all of y'all be like, ""I'm out""
Gettin' your own shit
Shittin' in your own crib
I'm in no position to be fucking on my own still
This ain't some words on a paper
This is what my mind's made of
Emotional heart data
Like a skyscraper reaching up
Try to stay keeping up and trying to keep my feelings out of the beats and stuff
But Tay, they ain't believe in us

Been through so many struggles in my life
You would not believe where I have been
(I don't know where, I don't know how)
Even my lonely heart and sacrifice
Until the day that my life ends
(The place is here, the time is now)

Now at this moment
Phonte's flow is
Stomping through
Y'all niggas just tip toeing
Soon as they put it on
They say, he's big Willie
You just a Lil' Jon
Trying to get lower
This is proof that thee existence of persistence pays off and it's showing
Cause labels used to play me like
Now they better pay me like I'm Luke Wilson
Check your books, I ain't owing
Tay's a true terror
Y'all ain't busting caps
Y'all gangstas in the studio making a new era
And this is for whoever
Is trying to do me
Y'all need to do you, maybe then you'll do better
Cause I'm gonna be spitting till I walk with a cane
Left my mark on the game
And y'all just scribbling
I'm etched in stone, y'all just penciled in
Number two status, that's your place nigga, live with it

They don't know the shoes I walk in
So I guess they'll keep on talking
 


We gon' build it up, build it up, build it up
And now we're solid
Solid as a rock

It's solid, it's solid
You'll know, you'll
Cos when you hold that thing in your hand and you know it's solid
It's not a liquid, it's not a gas, it's solid, it's solid, let me tell ya again
Solid, solid
So solid
It's what we got, what we got, what we got
Can I have some cake? Is the cake solid?
It's solid cake, it's vanilla solid cake baby

And it's got icing on it!

Icing on the cake! It's got icing on the cake!
Now ain't that the best thing you ever heard",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-the-time-is-now-lyrics
Bum Deal,The Official Bootleg,2003,"We bring it down on the two ‘cause we’re not the ones
No, we're not the ones
We bring it down on the two ‘cause we’re not the ones
We're not the ones, yo, we're not the ones

I.  Drop.  My.  Style like this
Twist, shape shift, bum deals get diss
My flow's been blessed, chopping up at the breath
Expand thoughts, chest retract, inhale the cess
Digression—best defense emcees kept possession
Southeast to northwest, contest to submission
I flex, release, tense muscles and cease
Stole the master key to free 'em from the industry leash
I got a, full mind,  with lethal weapons
Breaking down crews in seconds while the hardcore beckons
But I, stay focused even though triggers attempt
Even though niggas are bent, so quick to represent
Real emcees, we broke, Moet don't wet my throat
I keep a double-edged sword, no one to mute the remote
You need to keep your mouth shut, talking jaja on wax
And no doubt, we'll see what happens with the company tax
You know you gotta recoup, keeping your niggas with loot
And gambling with your soul, 
rocks is your papers they shoot
You're tampering with the art, and you're position's just temp
I got the full-time job from bum deals in zest

We bring it down on the two ‘cause we’re not the ones
She's not your daughter, and I'm not your son
So why you tryna play us like we're dumb?
These deal is for bums

From the cradle to the grave, elementary to the penitentiary
The Black man's been getting the bum deal of the century
Now you want to get with the rap techniques you used to diss
I see you in these Coca-Cola commercials, and it's really making me pissed
But I gotta give my , do and get my boots
Two, in come more through.  True, and get my loot too
But you gotta remember from which this household started
And these labels are trying to gas you up like someone farted
I come more strong-hearted than Lion-O
 is my father and What? What? is 
So we had no choice but to be good guys with appeal
And don't got no time for nobody's whack record deal
I feel we should make one buck out of every album that we sell
If we did, you don't think that I'd know you'd make twelve?  What the hell?
I got a job, she's got a job, he's got a job, we’re all in school
So why is it that you're trying to play us for fools?
‘Cause most shit stinks like bird stool, can't hack it
And I don't want to be playin’ like white shit up on my jacket
Your tax bracket sees you green, while all these emcees see is teal
What are we, assholes?  You can keep your bum deal

We bring it down on the two ‘cause we’re not the ones
She's not your daughter, and I'm not your son
So why you tryna play us like we're dumb?
These deal is for bums

I'm surrounded by: bums
Crowded by: bums
Your style is like: bums
Bums

I need no bum deal for my bung-hole
You sold your soul—now they're in control
Jerked your body like a marionette
Took your pens and your pads and replaced them with texts
No say in the game, rappers sounding the same
I'm sick of Versace, Chanel, and Gucci, drinking champagne
Love's gonna getcha, I betcha, double dare you
Physical challenge, your player shit is losing balance
Get off the job, talk—your whole aura is weak
My black people either got to be Italian or Greek
Need to step off the scene, contracts and wicked seals, for real
Keep your whack-ass fucking bum deal

We bring it down on the two ‘cause we’re not the ones
She's not your daughter, and I'm not your son

Or I can be he wind that makes you moan
Depending how you treat me baby
See I can be the beacon, brings you light
Or I can be blacker, colder than midnight
So how you gonna see me baby
Now either you can go on and choose me
Or baby you're gon' go on and lose me
Cause I can be, I can be, I can be, I can be
I can be, I can be, I can be, I can be

If I could be blatant with, well, what I gotta say about you and I is
What I gotta do to not see it Kevin Smith way
You know, View Askew, babe
Give it to me straighter than a hetero, I'll pay for petrol
We can go riding through the metro (polis)
Put it together because separate causes, misunderstanding, watch
Metropolis
That's like us, see together we marvelous
Hard as the city of the concrete gardens
Split it up, inserts the margins, you get confusion, the words lose purpose
The mark and the target, the arc and the aim like a dart just miss position
If I can explain the way we need to go and where we gonna go, I can do it just like this
Listen
I guess this is the infamous, ""What is this really?"" conversation
Man I hate as a miss is this it's me bringing it up
Predictable dating
But you won't, I've been waiting
I wouldn't bother, wouldn't have the patience
It would be the aphid in the room, wasted breath, but I think you're amazing
That being said... (dot, dot, dot)
Love the way the bed rock non-stop
Love the time we spend, chill, eat, shop
Even iller the days we pretend we wanna be at our own spots
But then you knock, knock, knock
But yet still not confirming lock
I need to know or else just get dropped
Get canned, get blocked
Got plans, or not?


The way you think is appealing I
Like the feeling of thinking of you
Like to know that you're thinking of me
Like the feeling of being us, two
Might reveal how I'm feeling too much
Might be feeling the fear, we do rush
Fight the feeling to flee, to lose us
Type to reel in the scenes and lose trust
Slice the dealings and leave, abuse lust
Cuts and bruises, I see you lose love
But you chose to redeem it, who does?
Fuck the blues and the demons, choose one
Human to humor cupid with some ""cue in the music cupid shit""
Come
Lose the race in the shoes that you run
Fuse the pace of the two into one",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-bridge-lyrics
Crayon Ruins,Gotham Down Deluxe,2013.0,"We flew into the rainbow of the city's crayon ruins
The colours splashed below us, glowing in the dark
And losing meaning by the day
I'm losing my head, but still giving my heart to you
And oh, how beautiful it seemed from a distance
With the moonlight glistening in awe
Of the silence, and the stillness
And the grace of it all

He said, ""The sky's falling""
Took my hand in his, started running for the hills
Well not the literal hills
In little heels I was taking little spills along the sidewalk
People stumbling out of dive bars
I said, ""What are you running for, I was having a good time
Weren't you having a good time baby? Won't you slow down and talk to me?""
But he said, ""We can't slow down now, we just gotta go, babe""
We ran like we were floating on the waves of the concrete
Up East Houston, past the Bureau and the Mercury
I remember thinking, I'm glad I ordered no dessert for me
Passed the gas station, reached the steps of the F Train
Met change at the top of the stairs, I'm definitely
Confused-face emoticon
Then sighted a motorcade
We weren't even focused on, slow fade into the sirens
Climbing, creeping down Broadway
Firemen lying on the corner of LaFayette
Fire hazard signs, we were peeping all the doorways
The environment of violence that appeared on the set
Like we were touring at the Paramount lot
Situation paramount, we turned and ran down the block
And the air raids rang out
People started running, and people started screaming
And the guns started banging from the rooftops
Bleeding civilians started to fall
The millions in New York didn't stop to help at all
And we ran, and we ducked, and weaved behind trucks
As the storefronts in SoHo started to blow their windows
Rejected impulses, we failed to save anyone
And a stray car just missed us on the way to hit a building
We were running past some neighbors passing them their children
And oh, the city's getting gassed from below
It's pouring down manholes, blowing, and
Wrapping shirts around my face and screaming
I said at sunrise, meet me back in Dumbo
Looked in his eyes, kissed his lips with our guns low
Tightened my sleeves around my neck and started bookin'
Towards the bridge, headed to the planet of Brooklyn

We flew into the rainbow of the city's crayon ruins
The colours splashed below us, glowing in the dark
And losing meaning by the day
I'm losing my head, but still giving my heart to you
And oh, how beautiful it seemed from a distance

What Would I Do,Attack of the Attacking Things,UnKnown,"Intro]
Yo, 1 for the beat, 2 for the real (Alright)
Cats who never doubted I was dropping the skill
For all my peoples in the NY and SA who blessed me
A  
gassed face
 to all those who still wanna test me (Word)
3 for the fans who already know the name (Who?)
4 smacks to all wack niggas in the game (Yes)
5,6,7,8,9,10 for the flows
Ay yo, Len.  Drop it to zero.  This how the story goes:

Drama, so close to not completing the missing piece of the puzzle
Quit again, in again, drop suit be followin’
Swallowing pride like porn stars and money shots
I'm hitting ya blocks, spinning as heavy as SUV’s doing 360’s
I'm ready as ever, overdue like the rain in New York
Sustained a steady fan base, but you still don't know me
Hold me in your highest regards, I'm your homie
I relate—it's personal, nothing fake, read me.  Wait, I'd rather dictate it
Relay it to you on a deeper level
Kick off your shoes and light your L’s.  Let’s talk and get to know each other
Better.  I'm Jean, honorable team player for years
Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes
For sho'.  It's crunch time.  I'm the one they sent to piss your label off
They won't fuck with me, unless I'm paradin’, taking it off
Nah, man.  Executives con man
This record is too hot to get pushed back another minute
It would burn a set control.  Well, admit it
You liked it when the first bar dropped
In less than one second, she's already spitting
I need y’all.  You want a change?  Well here it is
Let's stop complaining, make it happen—everybody step up your game
‘Cause everybody's stuck in park or reverse
Lettin’ media choose your path and rape you, market you less than you worth
I was gonna throw your towel in
But honestly, you cats deserve some better music
Plus, come on.  What else would I be doing?  Shit…

(What, what, what would I do?) If, like my people, said, ""I left it to you""
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?) If I didn't try a verse, if I didn't rhyme
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?) If I just hated and did nothing to change it
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?) Hell no, that could never happen

There's so much further to go
I feel like Mindy Cohen doing the One to Grow On
Yeah, I'm old school—40’s and high tops
Triple Gooses and Travel Fox.  Huaraches and Blow Pops
I'm down to earth but still dreamin’.  Peace to Skeme Team and all of my niggas on the come up
Apani and Lyric, we gon' take it there
The rest of y’all just taking up space and you don't even care
It's like you started eating Thanksgiving dinner without saying grace
I whisper a prayer for you ‘cause you cats are lost and probably not gon' make it back
Fuck it.  It's more for me, I guess.  So please don't stress it
The best is yet to come.  This is just an introduction
I'm 'bout to have niggas madder than big titty girls who gettin’ breast reductions
The purpose of my function is to smash, simply put, trash you
Until you cry, ""Uncle, mercy,"" wander aimless in this concrete jungle and curse me
There ain't a need for verse three—I can feel it
That would rob you of your manhood and I'm not into stealing
So tell me…

(What, what, what would I do?) If, like my people, said, ""I left it to you""
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?) If I didn't try a verse, if I didn't rhyme
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?) If I just hated and did nothing to change it
(Tell me what, what, what would I do?) Hell no, that could never happen

Ha ha, yeah man... And it's only the beginning...
Better choose sides now…",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-what-would-i-do-lyrics
You Don’t Want It,The Official Bootleg,2003,"Yeah loser, well if you're choosing to go against Jean
You better assemble a squad that's better than the A-team
With the green hulk and shit that pop shirts
And a nigga with a shovel I can borrow when I drop the dirt
No lord, she's gone bizzurk again
The fucking pen was dripping blood and vision was fuzzy, blurred and then she murdered them
I flirt dirty visions mostly unheard from the mouths of women
I guess I've just been blessed with a criminal intuition
Spit with a girly voice and nerdy with prose
And fully dressed so no one accidentally trips and says, ""Hold on a minute""
I flow so deep that I fall in it
Prolong words like penis and chokes that spin ?
I'm like trying to get free drugs, no credit
So fuck the industry, album had no edits
And fuck Prada, man, I'll ? cause I'm broke
And I'm sorry I gotta stay out of trouble, there's no HMO medic
Ah forget it, I'll just get off the syllable letter
Just fizzle like acid burning your flesh until it's down to the gristle
You listening now? Yeah, wow
Well piss in your mouth wit your own dick, come on niggas, fidget around
I'm about to get on everybody's last nerve
Take half of your crowd, pimp them out, have them calling your house
Nah, just fucking around
Small time like I'm a bunch of horny niggas, circle jerking with your digits, ow!
One for the ladies, two cops ? niggas on rooftops
Busting off shots with illegal 380's and drop
Three for me so I can easily triple it
Minus 8, double it, kick a mean 16
It's Jean, sorry if the intro was vague
The surname is Grae, purpose of the words I say
Just to get the chance to play
And hurt the birds who don't deserve to stay in it
So Black I'll smack you right in your cap
So that your knee can grow
Old nigga, figure it out
It's clever, so let's sing it together

You don't want it
You don't really really want it
You don't really...",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-you-dont-want-it-lyrics
Block Party,Attack of the Attacking Things,UnKnown,"{*35 second intro is a conversation*}

Listen
I don't wanna preach or come off bitter, this is a commentary auditory
Editorial, about the state of things, state of mind and state of being
What the fuck is goin on? How the fuck we gonna make it out?
It's hectic, from asbestos filled classrooms
To the stench of death that's still in New York
The air is thick with it, but it reaches further
Like the world murder rate
Circulate, cultivate your mind and soul, your heart and your body
So stagnant; niggas, get off your block and travel
Stop actin like your flesh is metal and your hood's a magnet
We need to globalize, further spread on this earth
To appreciate the full value of individual worth
To realize how ridiculous the thought of ownership is
And protectin your turf - that's bullshit man
That's how we got colonized
Missionaries create foreign schools and change the native way & thinkin
So in ten years, we can have a foreign Columbine
In some small village in the Amazon, c'mon man

You need to get out your house, get off your block, and see somethin
Go do somethin, go CHANGE somethin, or else we fall for nothin
You need to, travel the world
And when you come back, tell your girl and your girl and your girl..
And your man and your man and your man.. you understand?
So spread the word

It's every man for himself
That's why the black community is lackin in wealth, there's no unity
We soon to be chillin with rich white folk
And that means that we made it
Let our kids go hungry before our wardrobe is outdated
Rap careers are drug related, ballplayers, we need more lawyers
More housin and job created, why we waitin for it to be given?
We need to get up, and get out, and make our own livin
Instead of just makin more, inner-city children
More doctors in your building, righteous cops next door
If the system's corrupt, then change it
Fought for the right to vote, don't even use it
Forget electoral winnin
The way the world's goin, we in the ninth inning
Heh, and we still aren't up to bat
Niggas is happy just to have the rights to sit on the bench
Like floor seats is alright, and that's as far as we reach
Materialistic values, not morals, that's what we teach
I see it in the youth, hungry for fame and money
Not for knowledge and pursuit of the truth
Pick up a book or a newspaper
Take a free class in politics or human behavior
We need to stop actin victimized, it's like we're day-walkin blind
Open your eyes, there's a whole world out there


And you don't have to agree, or just be happy
Content and lose your hunger, push further
Cause I don't believe that pipe dreams exist
The world is what you make it, your life is all that you got
So take it to the limit
Why would you deny your spirit growth and happiness?
And if your peoples hold you back, they not your peoples at all
You know the, misery cliche
Ladies, know your worth; the way we givin it up
We might as well auction ourselves on eBay, to the lowest bidder
So what if his dough is better? Money doesn't make the man
Maybe self-sufficiency would better make you understand
Let's get it together
There's so much promise and it's just goin to waste
We turn crude, lack of class, lack of taste
And trust, they laughin at us
It's slow genocide
And I don't care how many bottles of Cristal you pop
It won't un-expose you as a known pedophile
Native child, runnin wild, to the ends of the earth
I'll see y'all at the last hundred miles, bet
 - repeat 2X

A Little Story,The Official Bootleg,2003,"Here's a little story that must be told

The story of a young girl, praying for those who chose her to notice
This golden child  entitled the holy grail drinker
For sure a soldier trooper
Maneuver through your crew and noticed only overseas and quoted like a ? maneuver
Picture different, my vision position to capture moments
And living it only dreaming children are pretty to know
And Jean holding zero ? dinero is the current state
I'm exposing the lack of folding ? limos ? empty plates
It's all fucked up, writing across the wall, sucker
My thoughts are trapped in ink and imagining them being wrapped in mink
But life is routed on roads with broken glass and potholes and shit
I'm running barefoot on the same street you drive your Rolls in
Luxury gangsta whips and cliques and women
Liquor-driven strippers chilling in your coke-infested place of living
I got a stoag and a match, a dream of toking some tracks
? cash, so why should niggas listen?
I throwback like Kodak clips
That means I go back to old hits and re-take prints with new spit
Then throw that to yo ?
You know that trick, whoa
With that ho? I mean that shit, yo
Suppose you only used to chicks who use they tits to boost sales
And boot males who switch the crew they with but really fails
Cause rap fans are finicky, your approach is gimmicky
So your turn's over fast, like a young man's virginity
Ms. Grae, the unknown vet, destined to stardom
Reaching higher up than Harlem is to L.E.S. Puerto Ricans
You're blowing smoke and shooting dope and speaking nothing
Niggas is tripping, video bitches are making a killing
Little girls thinking they're grown women in bra tops
But will it matter soon when the bomb drops, it all stops
We're thinking ghetto warfare, you should be thinking bigger
Money, bitches, and houses, they're still calling you a nigga
This is the mind of a visionary
Imprisoned in matrimony with rapping in shackled ?
Black like ya homie selling crack in the back of an alley
You know me in fact, I'm the shadow behind you creeping slowly
Smoking dro, analyzing ambition
While I'm fantasizing, planning trips of tanning on islands with ?
Up and down ? magazine
Poster child for ? scholars, ? kerosene find me
Maybe finally in colleges with adolescent scholars
PlayStations for twenty kids making a hundred dollars
Maybe chilling in Hollis with ? wallets open
Splitting change for dutches for rolling, munchies for after smoking
The intro, for y'all who ain't know
The first is J-E-N
The second's G-R, then the letter of every first plan
Next, the last to the end of this verse, I'm hoping your spelling it works
Cause it's the end of the verse",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-a-little-story-lyrics
No Doubt,Attack of the Attacking Things,UnKnown,"I ain't afraid to shine different, c'mon
Devoted life to the dream of lights and fortune and fame
I might just gain the vision or just might be livin in vain
See in the game it's cool strolls and platinum thugs
Stack the cash, drugs and women
Bubble in crime, trouble in time
I stay humble with mine
Had drama for words
Encountered some birds who tried to take the shine
But I'm illuminating like a thousand frozen wrists in the glint of the sun
Worth the Franklin Mint and Wall Street combined into one
They can't see it yet though
Different like niggas saying petrol
For gas, english metric system, graded on the past
Just trying to reach y'all, no one's at my arms length
Wanna stay in the race but slowly running out of breath
They all alike, can't understand, maybe it's safest
To play the role and be another glitch in The Matrix
Repetitive flow, embedded in dough
I run the risk of pissin everybody off
But I don't care if you know

Yo I'm on the line like white, china, table
Lay it all out for the shit; nigga, no, doubt
Fuck real, I'm right, told you the last time man
Fuck y'all, say it
Bring it, lay it all out for the shit; nigga, no, doubt
Fuck real, I'm right, told you the last time
Things ain't different, say it
Bring it, I'm on, now

Quit for good, too many times, shit maybe I should
But it won't prevent rejection reappearing in life
I even lay the toughest down for you
Paint the ground blood, pain for you
Only so that you feel me right
Then hear me tight from the ills perhaps
But not a lot of scenes like movie stills are fleeing from fiends and caps
I had, thrills and high spills, couple of hot chases
Romance with Jacks
Jills in dirty places
No jail cell been filled and no court cases
But committed murder of flesh
Two of my own faces
At best I'm, a dime each, not a dozen, never cheap
Fornicated adultery once and now I never cheat
Younger sibling or two
Family dysfunctional
Problem with being on time, hardly ever punctual
Punchclocks give me the runs
Just not in my blood Akki
Y'all flashing guns at me, time to go
Let it be


See I got these bill collectors
Practically at the door chilling
I can't explain to Visa how I'm trying to stack a million
Hustle on the side for chump change
It's not big time
I only do it for fries, chicken and wine and hump days
Reality spit, dudes and rap bitches sick of me
And if they right, they still print
I'm trying to do calligraphy
All real, sit up just all night
Just thinking it's all wrong
Won't sleep 'til everything's alright
I made brush fire noise
I need four alarm
Three A.M. on the lawn with two kids and one slipper on
Blaze now, your days phase out like old sitcoms
Tryin to save the show by putting new fucking kids on
Love me or not
Respect it for what it's worth
I'm like a bundle of dough in a knot in a purse under your cot
Undiscovered lines like connecting the dots
It's gonna happen, sooner or later
Fuck rapping, just giving data",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-no-doubt-lyrics
Code Red,The Official Bootleg,2003,"See every life brings a moment of intense hatred
Body inseminated with foul thoughts and  patience
Most likely waited out, ?
Chasing the cloud before you start thinking of
Lacing a crowd of people with a round of bullets flying free
Visioning bodies dying in threes
Temperature dropping from 98.6 degrees
And their souls leaving their bodily shell
Well, probably do well to flee the scene
Before the cops arrive and shoot you up until you rotting in Hell
I'm saying, I know that most of y'all relating
Even hatred flashbacks, are subsequently losing it
Niggas without guns are those who used to using it
With index fingers locked in trigger-pulling positions
No matter which category you fit in, listen
It's a dark day, cluttered thoughts like crowds on eastern parkways
Try to calm your heart with spears ?
Your girl cheated on you with your cousin
Or she tells you that she's eating for two, and then you find out that she really wasn't
Your man hit on your mom, your dad dislocated your arm
For fighting with him when he knew he was wrong
Your boss fired you, the week before the rent is due
Your wife lied to you
Your husband caught him with a guy or two, you're trying to
Just not invoke the spirit of Satan into your hands
Do something you might regret, cause something has gotta let
This demon is creeping up to the surface of your brain
Working overtime to plan escapes from running from your murder route
It's nervous, I've heard it before, cause I've been there
Balanced on a thin line ready to topple at any time or anywhere
Anytime, anywhere
Anytime, anywhere

Cause love...
So difficult to live it up, just give it up
Let's switch it up to hate, let's bitch and fuss
You see cause love is based on trust
And I've been hurt too much to take that leap of faith
I'll wrap and keep it safe and save face
So say your grace cause we just don't give a fuck

I can hear voices screaming of angels and devils schemin'
To crawl up my shoulders and just duke it out
Throw it up, puke it out
The pit of my stomach is bleeding
The shit that I'm thinking is turning me green
And I'm losing it quick, confusin' random people
Walking with niggas that I wanna get back
The slack of my stride is ?
My feet knocking on pavement like I'm cracking it in fours
My mental math is way off course
Columbus style, my dental work is fake out smiles
Hatin' myself for fading into the pit of the blackness
No anger management course can even switch a track of
Thinking I'm sinking in deeper, meetin' the reaper, chillin'
Sippin' shots of tequila, while he's kickin' it to women, where's the ether

Breathe the sulfur, the brimstone
Fear and suffering alone
? and comfort me like Jim Jones
Recruiting clones and ? clans
The pick of the litter, ? follow the leader, then sinking in quicksand
With no particular plan, I'm just slick with a sinister scam
Politicking, promising to deliver the land
'Til they kissing the ring on the hand of the king
The gospel, spreading like a venomous thing
'Til my name in the tenements ring, generous with nothing
Greedy with the riches, for all the times I got
Beat in this business, cheating on bitches
Feeding the sickness, like a cancer eating at your skin
Leaving you titless, witless, only Jehovah would witness
Satan is grinning cause he's winning, loving the hatred
In this age where nothing is sacred
We covet thy neighbor's wives, under the covers, they mothers lie
Naked with they daughter's baby's fathers
In the wake of modern day harvest
Cities burn like Sodom and Gomorrah
The ? nightmares might occur again anytime, anywhere
Anytime, anywhere
Anytime, anywhere


? gases that you breathing and dying
The heat of the night, the streets are bright with heat seekers in flight
Them patriot missiles that whistle and streak through the skies
People fight for their right to kiss their freedom goodbye
I don't love her, but I keep it inside and never speak of the times I cheated
I just beat her and leave her believing the lies
I'm trying to stop the leak in my eye
I cry for the weak who have pride, but won't see a piece of the pie
Who forfeit them to the system and let it eat them alive
Listen my mission is to sufficiently try
Not to lose a piece of my mind
And change to a deranged piece of a guy
And take aim at the ones that chain us by the feet and leave us die
And told us the evilest lie
To the people that fed them drugs in needles to get high
Conspiracy theory is clear to me
But when I speak, my people don't hear me, I'm getting followed by M.I.B
Constantly fearing retaliation for my revelation
I find myself panicking in a train station
My nation is racist, I hate this
I'm anxious to take this ? shit and blast my way out of a matrix
This world of fakeness is faceless, face it
Every life has its moment of intense hatred",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-code-red-lyrics
Chapter One: Destiny,The Official Bootleg,2003,"We begin our story in L.A
Our player's on a mission: a mission of revenge
In a small town, a fire breaks out
Shots pierce the air, and a massive killing spree begins
Is this just a random act of senseless violence
Or is this story deeper?
Is there a reason behind these psychotic actions?
Welcome to the mind of a contract assassin
Whose time has just run out
And whose fate will be decided, by you, the listener

Running like a bat out of Hell with blind fury
Hundred-yard dash, smoking mirrors, eyes blurry
Hit the porch bleeding red, seven dead, two in the trunk in the back
Scanning through the goggles for the Cadillac, left it running
Swiveled my body to the sound of shots, cocked back
And let them fly, bullets screaming, left leg bleeding heavy
Ducking the sounds of the Chevy that pulled up to the lawn
Breathing heavy from the smoke ?
Jump in the passenger side and hit the pedal ?
? ride, I'm half-gone
Leather is hot from sitting the sun
The chrome burning my leg ? puddles of red
Screeching out, rubber smoking, I'm ghost, the wheel is broken
The door is half-open, my lung ? air chokin'
Sick the chase kicks this way
I'm headed to a small town, just outside the city walls of L.A

Destiny ridin', just a matter of time
And put it all behind me, bullet holes and bodies
Motels and lobbies , ? hell find me
I'll be inside the arms of fate hiding
Can't run from nothing, I'll just keep fucking
Search and kill, ducking 'til they're all gone
Got to do something, can't just keep running
I swear to God I won't stop the song

This road driving got me bugging got me seeing vision
This company dealing got me killing children and women, holy God forgive me
Now I'm headed to save the very seeds of life
? hands of time supposedly outliving my husband and kids
They caught him in a Krispy Kreme on the fly
For leaving the company without a reason why
They said they'd relocate me to Hell, put my mama in jail
I fuck around and leave them all to Satan making a bail
Associate's supposed to get me guns but he switched
Found him bloody on a windy Sunday, deep in a ditch
I travel from motel to motel, steal whips and kill
And cover tracks, laughing, pull off quick
Dump the Caddy for a black Impala
Slit the neck of a collar or a priest
And then a deacon and then I sped off east
Reach a rest stop, made out with the cook
Snapped his neck, took the truck and bounced and nobody looked


Sitting in this car sniffing coke on a dash
Tinted windows, Isaac Hayes blast, mind a million miles a second
Clothes wrecked hands bloody, brains on the seat
Range and Honda and a Dodge Viper parked next to me
The motion sensor lights dimmed well
The stove lit, twelve butts, three lines, and one L
Contemplating suicide, the drugs got me wildin'
Complicated of the thoughts, the tears are flying
I'm thinking rush the door finally found the kidnappers thinking
Wait 'til 4 then bust in and start clapping
Should I go? Should I stay? Should I wild? Should I wait?

If you choose to rush out the door now, please choose track #7
If you choose to wait in the car and think of a plan until 4:00, please choose track #3",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-chapter-one-destiny-lyrics
Fade Out,Attack of the Attacking Things,UnKnown,"Someday when I see you, be with you again
Can't believe how I miss you, I'm there til the end
Demetrius I had to say something
My brain is stained with you
I don't even think I can explain how much I miss you
Your tears frame the page my fate is outlined in chalk
The other day I freaked on the street when someone walked like you walked
It took a second not to think it was you
And everything crashed down
I don't understand why god picks who he's gonna snatch out
Before you hit the ground I hope you passed out
I wish I could run up in heaven with gats, find you, and blast us out
I couldn't you brother, I heard he's with your grandmother
I spent two weeks on 411 trying to find the phone number
I didn't go to your wake
Got the call to late
And after I found out I spent a month in my room and never open the drapes
I didn't get to say goodbye - it's not fair
Hope you had fun in Miami, it seemed like you were meant to be there
My family talked about you often
I can't think of you in a coffin
Pardon the random thoughts
When I speak of you I get lost in memories
The intensity of losing you is like 1000 degrees in the desert
With no sight of water or trees
I dream of an oasis, seen you in a hundred faces
Hear you in music, pic you partying in different places
Like your favorite I guess, sometimes it snows in April
Your fate will never be forgiven, I'm cursing' every religion
My heart is always with you
And anyone that I love will have to know
A part of me can't go to them
Cause it's above..

How the fuck do I forget that shit every time? It's my fault
Maybe I should set an alarm, I mean damn
Even so much more lately and every time I'm still shocked and appalled like
Maybe Jean you should recall how this nigga lane be
And every time you try to make things right he burns it down to the ground
Don't turn around
You such a fucking victim, ain't ya
That kinda thing is just your nature
Well I kinda hate ya, oh
I loved you baby but that don't make me wrong
How many damn apologies can one man want?
You run then walk right back to guilty threads I won't
You must be fucking crazy
To think I wanna stay in a loss
I tried to let you get your player shit off
But let's be real, you never really understood how to feel
Can I get a witness?
I bet I could, so many bitches
And if everybody had a bit of you in 'em man they would be assholes
Bitter women, definitive feminists,
 giving this nigga the pass though
Remember that Jean is the enemy
You fill in the memory with an epiphany
That was a phony epiphany
What are you kidding? We been in the moment again and again I'm living no more
I made the decision to kick in the bucket and clicked the phone call
Off, boss, stick to being the victim most of time

Give It Up,This Week,2004,"See I was born in a zephyr, bitch
West wind terrorist
Archangel, left wing clipped off by the seraphims
Right wing sickened when the lightning struck it
So I flew against the sun until it lightened me from it
I'm unlikely to covet what you hype from your gullet
I'm more the type to re-dub it
Yours is trifling rubbish
So under this game my name should have a hyphen above it
When I break, push its hymen all the way to its stomach
Insane hard drive as if the AKA's Lacey
And the track was 
And the rap is a magnum
Or the rap is a handgun and the track is Thelma
The AKA is Louise and then I'm back with 
Gatling spitter, eat you cats for dinner
Like I'm Jean Yun-fat
Cooking rice in the back
Still, uh, deciphering that?
Killer, a Ku Klux blue blood
Filling their wardrobes until their shoes flood with loose guts
Ruthless as those people DeVito was with
You sluts take it off, I've been dressed ever since
Blessing this canvas better than priests in a sketching class
Sipping on holy water, dipping in watercolors
Gracious Grae, thicker than Tom Selleck's facial hair
Wait there, Jean'll remake you like Cape Fear
I'll take a cream pie and rub it 'til your face smeared
My sense of humour's intense, the cure would be death

What you stopping me for?

I'm the reason y’all breathe
The reason y’all been here from conception
Reason y’all believe in deception and faithfulness
I'll make your destiny and fate twist
And when I stop coming around, it's hatefulness
I paint bliss with you with me
Have you crying you miss me
Lying to you friends that you dissed me
I'm your world—kiss me and the globe turns
Sunrise and moon shine, ocean tide shift in just the blink of an eye
Game transcends time when I spend with you
Spit out incredible bull, lies are exceptional
Taking my prime-time whiz that I care about your kids
Truth this? I don't give a fuck as long as you is
Hit it up until it's raw, no protection—what for?
I know you not chicken.  Only call on me when you fiending for it
Only fuck top-notch bitches.  Dime pieces
If they dirt-broke or  single a 
I’m who you calling your man, who you calling your fam
Who you call late night in a jam
4:30 AM bawling to me.  I'm just plain balling, you see

You know you been open wide off me since the day I met you
Never let go of me.  When we fucking, you love me
When we in the streets, you motherfucking bitches touch me
I think it's funny you call me your honey
I call you when I'm feeling horny
You say when I'm not around, your pussy feeling lonely
I told you never let a bitch own you
Still, you buy me shit
Iceburg, Sony, Hitachi, a Motorola, Dreamcast, four controllers
Trip to Atlantic City like we some high rollers
Think you gonna lock it down
Even write me letters every time you outta town
Don't even read ‘em
What the fuck I need a wife for?  I lead the life of a free man
Told you I was a player since the first hand was dealt
Want me to meet your family?  Well, I got some news for them
If you got sisters,  put the move on ‘em
Let loose too on ‘em, loose screw on ‘em
Mom's too—even better, get her upon you
And your dad know the deal—he's a nigga
I'm saying the older you get the better you get at playing—for real

I've had ‘em all from the whores to good girls galore
Twins to wheelchair bitches, freaks to married hoes turned frigid
Classy models to pigeons

Another day, another hustle—you no different
I'm not the daddy for your children
Tell me you're separated, divorce pending
Listen, the only position you fill with pussy, you're in
I never spend a dime on you, but my time's precious
You whining on the jack about lack of respect for women
What if my daughter was to grow up, meet a villain like me?
Fuck it—I ain't got no children
If I did, I'd teach them better than you've been
Your self-esteem is all fucked
Must've been busted when growing up ‘cause pretty bitches know enough
And now you're mad, blowing up
Whatever, listen.  I gotta bounce
Your best friend's on the way to my house

Dumb bitch
Play your position
Dumb bitch
Play your position",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-gods-gift-lyrics
2-32's,Jeanius,2008.0,"Most of this here is just braggadocio
Emphatically spoke, impeccable rap flow
Second to that, wordplay akin to watching a verb
Hitting a piñata on the eve of its birthday
Uncommon like Erykah Phenomenon! Hysteria!
Hype, rocks millennium Sade criteria
Fuck the hearsay, please Jean's superior
Y'all yellow the same color of your bladder's interiors
You bore me to pieces, you feces mouth
And, yes, it's still shit if I mispronounce it bitch
How could it be doubted The beast mounted the pen
We're unsurmountable like you being surrounded by a ten man army in Afghanistan tents
With a caravan of Carolina and New York feds
Bless me with a holy 40 bottle from your corner stop and
Bet all your model entourage that we can get you popping
I'll deliver your liver on a plate with a slither of your shivering date
There's no mercy here put on your worsest gear
Your fucking with the word career
Assassin who just gave the job to murk ye onto Daily Planet
I raise havoc, like giving Mobb Deep a booster chair
Stupid, I'm uncouth and in the booth I'm rare
Name Northern Lights Pimp game, Dolemite
Spleens on assorted recordings I'm giving all the mics
Slaughtering them like cattle, hoarding the words
And then cornering them leaving just the ring it's absurd
I murder just for the fun of the sound of bodies falling
I'm eccentric I don't need white coats calling
It's just dementia, come on, quit your bawling
You'll only make Jean just slit your paws in
And then there's bloody parts and Jean's starts to saw and
It'll be ridiculous You're strawberry licorice
All over my kicks Mom mourning Snap! Picture this

For the record Imma keep spitting
Game booking
And leave the game looking
Like a shepherd with its sheep missing
I know you seen Dai'
On a lean
Spray your team Tres schemes
In Inglés wtih Jean Grae
Raising Cane phrasing slang cause shit is foul
In this flagrant game I'm O-fficial
Lingual assaults mangle
Wings on the archangel
The Grim Reaper's cane got my face and name
So I readily phrase spoke
And repping respray hope and
I'm steadily paid til heavenly gates open
Rhyme's musical, I'm fluent through
Spitting lyrics your spirit is congruent to
Nigga, I been rapping I handle that
'long as I got a ten track and a camel pack
I paid my dues
Never half step
Used to stomp niggas down just to raise my shoes
Obey my rules or face consequence from lower lower 3rd, the 8th continent
Come one come all the track is strong
I'm talking Clark with no glasses on cats is wrong
Waiting on a rebel when there's factions armed
Y'all niggas playing on a level that I practice on

High,The Official Bootleg,2003,"Claiming the city is mine, prettiest dime
I don’t like the way that people defending Kelly in public
Why it’s spoken on the verse?  Quote it, a similar intro
Who’s gonna get it?  Distant, feeling this glamour, tatted
Below the shoulders spelling, “Jean Grae.”  Inside
Picket fences and larger houses, them fuckers imitating
My life of living is a constant struggle, juggled
With empty hands, troubled and worried about the future plans
Hoping God’s looking out of high windows.  Keep
Climbing, keep falling back, sip a little Cognac
Hating many, holding pennies inside of the wallet instead
Of dollars—holler if you feel it.  The quest for dollar, sour
Green and achievement, bleed until my final hour, believe it
This hunger never quits, it only grows deeper
Get high, try to get my burn on like a ton of reefer
I’m a fiend, state of my mind is all green

You don’t
Even respect the history or bother to notice, street and
The feds is red enough, somebody’s child is laying dead, but fuck it
We use it in a single.  Most of you using less
Bars and more hooks, jiggling titties, sell a song and crooks
And criminals in Entourage, and nobody’s wrong—come off it
I’ve seen a puff and plenty.  In case your face is friendly
Could never kill, I’m ruthless only for the mic.  Defend me?
Never.  You could keep your cases for shit.  I’m chasing this
Dream, running a thousand feet in the sand, envisioning cream
Replacing rock, hitting brick walls, door shut
Take my picture, blow it up, post it on construction promo
Fighting it solo, companies shook to rock the boat
Alone in it, praying like Charlie for golden tickets
I’m sick of women diminished by bitches claiming they kick it, written
Strictly from the heart, skin will never be seen
Not for green

Niggas
Dying in troves, higher than kites, blood on their flyest clothes
Lying hoes, repping women stripping, neglecting their children
Deconstructing education as quick as they could be gaining
Elevation, but it’s always easy to dumb it.  You want it?
You got it, a nation of instant gratification, either
Microwaving or speeding ‘cause some fast cars are backed up
And scheming to reach in, American dreaming is catching up
I mean, you’re walking home and might get hit by a sniper
Life is always unappreciated, especially us
It could be genocide for certain unless we straighten it up
Awake and take control and be the colors we blush.  Creation
Never meant to only get as far as a bus.  Forsaken
All the splendor rendered us blind, thinking the world on recline
Watch Green Mile to open my mind and take me
Other places with Michael Duncan and Tom—you gotta feel me
Too much of something’s never good, keep it only for
Nights, so in my dreams, state of mind’s all green",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-high-lyrics
Football Season Is Over,Gotham Down Deluxe,2013,"By the time you read this I'll finally find my peace
After I finally find my piece that I hide under the sheets
The beast is all on me, the beast and its army, breathing on me
Leaning on me, keeping me feeling like I got a precinct on me
Told me that I wasn't necessary
Preceded to scold me like I was in Secretary
""Leave me alone"" I pleaded, I'm on to Tommy and Larry
""I'm feeding my people at home, please do not come near me""
But I know the debtor, company's policy, honestly
Totally got the false sense of camaraderie
See I was adept at keeping my family from the scope of things
When I was scoping things, when I was choking necks
When I was stabbing necks and put them in acid baths and jet
When I would rope them even in open views of bassinets
Stole rings when I passed checks
I opened things in vaults you couldn't imagine yet
Top level employee, live in the foyer
Because I'm always called in for not doing it your way
Always meeting Philip the divorcee in the hallway
Drinking up the coffee, yelled at for horseplay
I'd always get the job done, with the cops - none
But with the fucking cop's gun if I have to, with the fucking cap gun
Vince Vaughn in the backroom
, but you'd actually catch one
When I'd pull the magnum from its back-strap, remember that one?
Assassin number 1 when the factory started
We called it the factory manufacturing action artists
Caught me when I was heartless for humanity
Had started replacing missiles in the parked car batteries
Initially I was pleasing them in car parks
And using the spare car parts to carve darts to use randomly
On the common man, like the dude standing on the corner
A bomb with his hand in his goose with his family
Hero became a villain, filling the blanks, 
I'm feeling
I'm Hilary Banks on the evening of Trevor's death
Little acclaim given, shitty disdain spilled in
The killings I rank better believe was nowhere left
Said I was reckless, this was offensive
I did my best for them, more than a check list
The work got done, calendar filled with x's
Left New York, worked at the headquarters in Texas
Got a husband, home, babies, I'm making breakfast
Sending them to school with boxes of raisins and shit to profess
This with labors of love and my babies hug me every morning
Bursting in my room with little construction paper drawings
Left the house - to the building
Every day the double life brought fulfillment
Elevated to the basement where I checked in
To the locker room to get fitted with weapons
Every business trip I took relentless
Every school play I had perfect attendance
Had a balance as much as my Hannibal character let me
Dexter would have envied the temper I kept in me
They crept at night, they checked the lights
They broke the lock, they climbed the stairs, they left me just to fight
They took the only thing I ever cared in life
So now with nothing left, I want my chest alight

Out of breath and you haven't even heard me spit
Welcome to the Rap Olympics
Jean Grae the gold medalist
Dirty like old gymnastic coaches prone to pedophilia
Rap stamina longer than European professional pedalists
I bench press verbs, phrases and predicates
Make you run the track backwards
Like dyslexic hundred-yard dashes
Or treadmills that work in reverse
I'm the total package
Flow six pack
Syllables flip back
Dominique Dawes
Flawless triple somersaults in the mat
10.0 man head to toe
Line for line I'll rip you in the Strong Man comp limb from limb
Stick you with sharp-witted spit that's targeted like javelin throws
Pass these chicks like water and I'm the breaststroke
Collapse your chest and throat with final distances
This is a warning for anyone thinking of verbal brawling
I will kill you
Maybe just hit you with the lead pipe
Come on, y'all Brian Boitano
I'm all Tanya Harding, bitch please
I crunch comp like tummies and ab flexes
Smash egos to bits at once with the size of Texas
Push down chicks with push-ups and tits in their neck
To distract you from the fact that even their ghostwriters are wack
Smack you with your own hand, make you apologize
Rhymes are more brolic than teams of Yugoslavic women
Now that's gully, you just silly
Like Monopoly money paid by the Russians to rob the French judges
Kill me like Jason Williams claimed the chauffeur did
Go for the toast
I choke you with smoke and fire spit
Boast cause I'm nicer with the mouthpiece than the whole Team Liberty
You're confused like Skifest barbecues
Ice grilling me
Shit I'm straight sick, you straight bitch
Only way you'll come first with your dick in your fists
Can't even get bronze, you could maybe get fifth
If you couple your score of nothing
With the number of digits I'mma scar your face with
High-jump your gas dome
My words pole vault while yours stay at low levels with asphalt, asshole
I'm your new personal trainer, it's Jean
Get niggas' heads bouncing harder than Greg Louganis, obscene
About to change your whole perspective of rap
How many times you think you're gonna play this shit back",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-breathe-easy-lyrics

Keep it that way
There's nothing wrong with partying
Get your drink on
Oh, who's that?
Oh that's your girl? You with her?
She look like everybody else in here

C'mon
They're not like me (That's a shame)
Baby bet you know they're not like me
And everywhere you go it's not easy
Just to come across a girl like Jean, oh no
C'mon it's not likely
And everywhere you go they're not like me (So what's up?)
And baby bet you know it's not easy (Uh huh)
Just to come across a girl like Jean
Oh no

Pardon my composure
Saw you, had to approach you, move closer
Confidence all courtesy of the mimosas
Framed perfect
Like a picture with the sharpest image
From the lips of a cherub, cherry red
Henny breath, let me guess
Queens, is ya?
See Jean can read by the lean
And the tilt of the cap and your drink, I'll refill that
I need some good conversation, love
These hoodrats be making up the game
Plus they ain't even fully developed, I'm sayin'
See we could start a challenge
Of balancing most delicate matters
Involving plans, including satin and carriages... Wait, too far
Maybe we could shoot a little hoop
Or just chill on my stoop
I don't like a lot of hoopla
Me and you, sedude deuces and spiked juices
Some stoges, some backwards-rolled backwood in Cubans, that good?
So write your name, oldschool, pen on the back
Now what's a good time tomorrow?
I don't stall
Holla back


You see I walk up different on 'em
Talk slang often
Bought dinner at dutch
While most women do the wallet clutch
Never ask the whip question
Make jokes interesting
Wear more clothes and let their eyes do the undressing
A little sarcasm, bar savage, tar addict
Argue about Reasonable Doubt and Illmatic
Car traffic eyein'
We can walk in summer laughing
Cry when they giggle
Split sides and curse
The magic that's in between us boy
Jean a fiend for the love-feeling
We crush dream and after lush green
And the sun shinin' and enough beach for a lifetime
And you're just mine
Pop in that Hathaway
Wonder and Gaye and rewind
Play a little chess strip
I read a lot
Beam you a little sixteen of something
I cook well
Sip on drinks and just chill
I'm malt liquor and M.O.P.,
Tell me what you feel


See we could be for life, even
For nights breathing heavy and steaming
From polite greetings to late-at-night face-smashing
Taste passion and race place baggage
My faith asking to place faith back in and maybe marriage
I hate slackers
Jean love to chill and lay out
Sometimes stay out
We'll find an open bar
I'm not impressed by payouts
So star, display out your cards
We can splay out on the top of cars
And pick the constellations
While playing the best of the Bards
You're making me nod agreeing
Patience is all I'm needing
Face it, I'm not your average girl
Or just close to it even
Most original
Entranced by your physical plans
I've got a lot, but we could chill
That's all I ask

Bad employees
Ain’t good employees
So true

Let’s get it straight
They employees I’m the boss
Edison grain Himalayan salt
Bars act as medicine man laying hands
Contact niggas a brand to maintain fans
I’m prone to darker thoughts and Peter Parker witticism
Known to target more than people gone to prison system
Women carcuses burned and park and earned on a mantle
I’ll still be the hardest worker just a shift in prisons
I’ve always been a prophet conjurer manifester
Better than 100% of them
Dentagrip in the hand of the better gent better than gentleman
Just presented the option of settling in
Back of the bus relegated like black slated
The lady with crack laid in the pages
Lack of phrases never
Hope that we’re trapped in a case together
Rorschach and Watchmen approach until and fall until their balls back in
Here’s a vodka toast for every hour on the hour
So I don’t go cop a toast
Michael Douglas falling down
I’m a Kings County resider with a bounty hunter on the sider
With the county call the 
Got a renaissance
Probably I’m a pass on the common class
Mosque and synagogue
Now we into simpletons
Spin a call spin it thin
Finnegan begin again
Optimism was wearing thin even on thicker carotin
The caring is a barren ain’t it
Call stress related aging and immortal babies
Morbid thoughts that separate you from your moral cause
But serenade and show them all the born creators
That’s why now I got to call the blond girls with pom poms
With their mom’s pearls at the prom
With the promise of going to good colleges to bond
On a scholarship
Dad’s in the Klan
My family’s into politics
I’ll choke with tampon strings
Smoke over your body while some asshole sings
I’m really not a part of your party
You’re grasping for mercy
I don’t have any personally ask him
*Listen I really can’t help you I gotta
See now I’m late
Now I’m late to do the hook
Now I just gotta just do pushups until the next verse
Alright really just shut up*
Oh that burns one hand
Let’s go*
Who's always Rosewood pissed off permanent bitch slaps
Doing the birdman hand rub in a six-passenger van
In the passenger seat and wearing a caftan
Blaring The Gap Band's covers of Scatman Crothers' jams
Unreasonable tin foil hat flow
Rap so blacks don’t back pedal to crack hoes
Mother land ex pat
Ex lax lexicon broad
When I land my jets to concourse
No pedestrians on board
Brontosaurus various ignoring the words to the chorus
So your morals hurt more like slipping on marbles
Non-carpeted long ass mall corridors
All mall smokes at hole in the wall bars
Sipping a long dog flipping off all y’all
Yeah that’s all I got jokes in bars
And I boast those joke
While you hope and costar
Praying like a space ghost coast to coast star
Ricky Lake and Lakos hosting postcards
Go-karts and Nascar reason for blowdarts
Big n*ggas old time
No I don’t spar
I’ll be at my Metamucil age refusing medicine
But then a tending to my linens
A gentleman good evening
Following my bereavement is a team challenge
Valance valor cadence patience manners
Basic etiquette relevant rhetoric brander
A reverent benevolent banter
Gallous gracious

Double Katanas,Gotham Down: cycle 1​:​Love In Infinity,2013.0,"I can see what you’re saying
Definitely see that
What I’m saying is
Just give me a hug
We don’t have to think about it like that
I know, I know, it hurts
Here, give me hug

I really could have been more
Perceptive to what you came for
I guess the lesson is before you change doors
Change locks, change floors
Tried to keep you in the same field, same force
That he was in when we was in a major game loss
Can’t play the game with two pitchers, one mound
Either head is swingin' with my head down
In the beginning, I was thinkin' what’s the damage though
Advantage you, love no
Not considerin' your time spent
Not considerin' your lies that were mine over time spanned
Or how I feel if maybe if in my feelings
I would start to get the feeling of being the one played
Considering maybe you were saying things too
That came as easily as things do

I know, I know, I know, I know
And maybe I could work someone else out
I know, I know, I know, I know
And we could make this work
I know, I know, I know, I know
Nah, hilarious, ha ha

I guess the joke is on Jean
Playing the fucking field with no team
Guess I had a lot of nerve to keep ‘em closely
And never nervous, thinking shit was keeping toasty
You’re doing too much, wish my niggas told me
And in the clutch I wish my crutch had been to notice it
That I was all up in the crushes like I’m Jodeci
Feenin’, or JoJo on the floor, heaving
We were on the road to being major, Deegan
We were on our board baby, swore the train was leaving
But not the train, like a train, heathen
Fuck it, I’m just tired of tryna explain even
Luck would have it, I don’t have a habit of believing
Motherfuckers who sucker you to stab it and then leave it
I'm a fucking elitist, rapping, undefeated
Trying to play a game I never motherfucking needed


Now Jeanie gotta go, I was saying that
In retrospect no disrespect
What everybody says, before they play your deck
I mean read your cards
You know? Hip your bars, bars, bars
I never meant to get fly, slide on the get-by
It’s not my style, next time I exit like a jet pilot
Eject up, I mean the high way
Not the highway, I mean the more desired way
Shut up, okay
I probably shouldn’t explain nothin'
Not in the double-negative way, I mean nothin'
Really all just said what I could say, fuck it
I’ve overextended my stay, bucket
List, I cross off the crosswind
That’s what I call this inevitable crossing
It’s a terrible loss and I’m more terrible for it
Fuck it, I’m just kidding, this whole thing was awesome

Ah, shit, I probably shouldn’t laugh
That’s right, that’s wrong, right
No, it’s not funny, it’s not funny
I’m not laughing
I’m—no, I’m—this is me caring about your feelings
Please, help me to help you
If you just—you should probably take your pants off
Cause I want to give you a hug
I wanna give you a hug
A close hug, a really close hug, a naked hug
Now, are you mad?
Are you leaving?
Oh um, will you call me tomorrow?
No? Okay. Okay, don’t answer that
Okay, I wasn’t thinking about—okay
It’s cool, it’s cool
I understand, I understand
No, I lied so, that’s probably bad for you

Yes, don’t do that and I get that now

Heck, you just cheating yourself from meeting
I can breathe a ton of these demons into my lungs
And I beat 'em no matter what self defeating attack comes
I put the past in the closet, leave it behind
Locked under key I would cast aside until I needed it padlocked
Put in a stash box, move it along
I learned how to learn patience and when acting is wrong
Turn 360 leisurely, pessimism know her and he grieve with me

Just think, what have I accomplished?
End of my life bonkers
What other pill to conquer
It would've just been awkward
Roommates explaining and didn't know why I changed
Since little before I named some pitiful reason lame or
Breaking down doors had even burst in tears
Grieving nurses to fear
Even land lady just standing and looking all fucked up
Like look what the fuck kids
Then cuff someone's arrested for punching a chest in

Just glad it never had to happen that way
I never would have had an album
Never had met Collin
Never had been travelling

Keep a bank card and a wallet for show, I hate empty spaces

My moms cataloguin my shit like she's Afeni Shakur
Many of y'all ain't even worth a penny for thoughts
So I ignore the rumors and the biters
More than y'all ignore the Unsigned Hype in The Source
Peace to Steady Rock and Tyson 
And a big fuck you to bitch Chris Lombardi at Matador
And every A&R that turned me down
Props to kids who stayed loyal since ""Baseball"" dropped
And copped the underground, see, the barrel was facin me
Now I turn the gun around and it's got unlimited ammunition
I dare you to question, now they'll know I'm dressin
So don't skip through the record
But if you're lookin for some shit to bump in the ride, you should check it

Alright, alright
One more time
One more time

37,jeannie.,2014.0,"I keep saying Imma find a love, but here I go
Feeling the worsening of feelings from a year ago
Can't fill in boxes on the internet, it's weird though
Can't put my pictures up cause they're a mirror for
Some creeping snitches who'd be like Jeannie is on sites
And then it turns into them clicking all the wrong types
Then turns to gossip possibly up in the Twitter streets
And then it's just the freaks, and me
It's really not appealing so I'd rather give it nothing no
Energy for the men and me expended in the clubbing
I was clubbing as an adolescent, my values less than my pals
My gals and me were never needed on the guest list
Maturity’s a blessing
I want bourbon and investments, a permanent address
Even Murder Myrtle has changed
It ain't a certainty to personally wanna evolve, I seen a lot of stunted growth and
Folks who stumble in jobs, and I don't mean puncture folks balloons in front of their moms
But you be popping shit about them man what when they're gone
I can't take complaints about your babies you made life
I can't make a date to come around if you ain't right
Man I don't wanna watch Worldstar you ain't fight
You'd think you'd learn better things in your twenties, ha
You'd better burn your thoughts of learning get your nerves ready
And get your purse ready honey everything is money get fucking Nurse Betty
Nutty with personal problems
And get your first divorce maybe these are verses options
Even your opticals are changing, 
you prefer vodka
Drop Henny to drop calories
, opt out of block parties or rap parties
And back out of brunches with a bunch of motherfuckers you don't even like
Doing it to prove to your what, you're losing in your life
And you discover things, that other things really more important
You're reading more again, you're seeking seasons more than often
Seeking offices, making travel, meeting offers, meeting deadlines, speaking more
And leaving awkward, but being cool with it later, I'll leave when I wanna
I'm cooler now than I would ever think about my number",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-37-lyrics
Watch Me,This Week,2004,"[Verse 1}
Ok, guess I gotta go back to basics, like I’m back wearing Asics
That my mama bought me
, I'm glad that my mama taught me
How to be a stronger person, when the time was urgent
I got the dirt up off me like a box of Tide detergent
Just watch me, niggas watch me now
Better watch out the mouth is more proper niggas spladow
A splash on you is a Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah
Was just implanted in my memory banks, Atlanta
Up to Canada then back home to South Africa
Thanks for widening the buzz diameter
Cause, let's do damage, competition meet your challenger
Losses zero and I still floss with no dinero
Apparel stay crisp though, kicks to pimp
The mixed chick with the equivalent of sulfuric spit
The hung juries split the tongues fury is guilty
But I'm just too cute to be considered this filthy
Industry can't milk me, They mad that they ain’t built me (god dammit)
My stamina’s at the status of can't kill me
A catastrophic cat on any topic
I'm toxic like Whitney and Bobby's blood, stop it

We all came in this life with one mission
And I plan to grind till mine kicks in, watch me
Can't stop me, or hold me back, nor pop me, now hold me fresh
That’s not probably, the best lie I sold you that
Silly J then the G nigga spray like a mack milly
Back up off me, before you get slapped
Will she back out? Ever put the mic down?
Never, watch me

It goes one for the beat (c’mon)
Two for the real (what)
Cats had never slept on the fact that Jean was ill
Lend me your eardrums friends
A couple spins in your Hummer Benz
Circle round your hood till it’s bubbling (I told ya'll,damn)
Triple fat bubblegoose as Jean's been
Trouble ever since the blackboards got useless
Truth is, school was just another tool to learn the vocab
To approach the world better, peers shuttering coach bags
Get the fuck on with that girl
I roast your asses like Friar’s Club toasters get most embarrassed
Fuck your four lashes
Jean'll rock some phony glasses and just stunt like they glowing with carrots
So what bastards, I don't roll with amateurs, niggas or vets
Like in our spare time we can’t put pets in
And ah yes, I'm marvelous thanks for asking
So smashing about to get talked about like the Passions coming attractions


Get your life straight (man), I'm not a lightweight (and)
I'm not referring to the pounds on the 5’8”
Structure please watch me, rupture these clique circles
Bully's burst like a muscle yanking on a heavy pully
First, ones called cooly used to be as unruly as son dooby in a porn movie with four whore groupies
Maybe that's reaching, I was a fast heathen
Couldn't catch me like I’m Tootie on them skates back in Eastland
I'm a derailed train, a females pain
Giving birth while the head nurse gives her husband brain
I'm worser than curse words written in cursors
I'm Dear John letters held them palms a sweating
You Gerber babies gerble on, Jean’s grown folk
But I’ll still throw a stick in your bike spokes, for choke dick
It’s time to get these keys and blocks like whip
I'm not mean but I’ll stomp like a brick at compost, shit",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-watch-me-lyrics
Thank Ya!,Attack of the Attacking Things,UnKnown,"Good evening!  Jean Grae.  Hello!

Y'all been wastin’ too much time and done left the door open for me (Really, really?  C'mon)
I mean sleepin’.  And fuckin’ up.  Well thank ya!  Thank ya!  (Thank you.  Thanks a lot, though)
Y'all been wastin’ too much time and done left the door open for me
Y'all been sleepin’, fuckin’ up all around.  Well thank ya!

I spit like the kids on the little bus—non-stop
Skill more disturbing than the thought of your ex having sex with one of your parents (Eww!)
All on top like the flip missionary mission
Beatch! I'm straight trippin’ like niggas done killed my cousin
Been slept on, passed-over like in the Jewish tradition
Cast in cameos like I'm dressed in hand-me-downs
A step-sister, an afterthought.  Niggas are shook.  It's alright
‘Cause I will smack you in the mouth.  I'm Jean Grae
And it's an ill life, watchin’ these niggas fall from ghetto grace
And I'm willin’ to fill in the blanks, spillin’ slick like a drunken oil tanker
Killin’ off every rank in your squad (Feelin’ me God?)
Vomitin’ constant drama 'til my larynx scarred (Ow!)
No passin’.  It is personal—fuck what you heard.  It's been too long
I'm ready to go on.  Y'all still in dress rehearsal
Studyin’ lines with understudies and clique buddies
Y'all just bullshittin’, practicin’, and need to be quittin’
 * simultaneous
Time to build back the paper (Time to do it)
Hurry up before we all go crazy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)
* Been so long, so long, much too long
* Don't it make you kinda wonder, if you trust it (Alright)
The biggest wheels in town are gettin’ busted (Verse two)

Too soon did you try and judge me.  Wait, that's dumb, conceited
Thinkin’ you even heard of the chick who's gonna kill you later
I'm kiddin’.  Bitter ‘cause I'm written off as some sex kitten
, freaky bitches like in 80's mittens—it's so sad!
Paid an insane amount of dues, underground to the death
I rep it, y'all been so supportive, don't download the record
Check me only in the ""yes"" box, never put ""no"" or ""maybe""
My gimmick bend more lyrics, straight lyrics, no crazy
The jig is up for real; rap puppies jumpin’ up and get a little treat for they deal
Shit, all I need is a toke and a pack of stokes and a frequent meal
Wait!  And a mansion.  Wait!  And a shiny car.  Jean Grae—superstar!
Really, just look at what happens ‘cause cats is wiggin’
""I know who should never hang out with Jerry's children!""
It's scary, like women that ain't really women—just dudes who tryna holla at 'em
Fuck, that was confusing.  Just let the dude sing (Alright)
 * simultaneous
Time to build back the paper (Time to do it)
Hurry up before we all go crazy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)
* Been so long, so long, much too long
* Don't it make you kinda wonder, if you trust it (For real)
The biggest wheels in town are gettin’ busted (Take it to the bridge!)

Too soon we think we know, too much, too soon we wanna play
While we let the best of the greatest slip away (Rewind!)

Y'all been wastin’ too much time and done left the door open for me (Thank you, thank you)
I mean sleepin’.  And fuckin’ up.  Well thank ya!  Thank ya!  (Thank ya!  Thank ya, bitches!)
Y'all been wastin’ too much time (This is where it goes off-beat) and done left the door open for me (Still feel it though)
Y'all been sleepin’, fuckin’ up all around.  Well thank ya! (Good night!)",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-thank-ya-lyrics

Flipping positions, missions written man I'm living proof
I took the mittens off
I'm slugging open fist
Shadowbox, slap boxing ""this world"" ain't shit
The double standards are driving me I'm mechanical now
The catalog is gradually bigger, annually
I'm a door breaker downer, law disobeyer
Crowd around her and all for simply saying ""this world"" need taming
I'm entertaining, yes attacking like Dick Cheney's chest
But lacking nuts so macadamia fuckers claim the best
It's not gon' last long
Homie I'm that strong
You gonna fuck up leaving ""this world"" past gone
I'm here to fuck perception
Right in it's 20/20 eye prescription
Leaving it blinded you should've brought protection
Watch your necks I'm sneaking up behind you
Like the tax in checks all of ""this world"" you're next

Y'all wanna let me in then you wanna change me up
Man, how the fuck you think you're ever gonna play me up?
You can't play me out, y'all just acting crazy now
I'll be doing Jeanie until ""this world"" fades out

Pass me on your block will ya
Know what I got for ya
A million stories and albums that never rock fillers
You like to cock fellas
Give them some accapellas
Never, ever, ever up in ""this world"" of y'all killers
Please, I'm 'bout to show you the meaning of work
Affirmative Jeanie's Action you can see if I dirt
And leave 'em bleeding and gasping like they're Jesus on wood
I wish I would get a reaction for all of ""this world""...good
Controversy works and plus I got a pussy
But even with that, people scared to push me, who's a pussy first?
A fucking hearse you'll have to share a space with
I'll get used to rocking ankle bracelets
Changed it, shit


Damn, y'all scared of change like some nickels chasing you
Running with pistols shooting, reckless till they're staining you
In all directions I'm aiming straighter than missiles nigga
Fingers arranged, one for ""this world"" one on the trigger
Both of my hands up
With loaded hand guns

We keep it gritty like the greats at the edge of the curb
Live and learn, living legend, Ninth and Mers, burn first
Now its Jeanie's turn to recite it to get your urn church
I mean chuch, get your blushing up
And button up, your luck is slowing and your cussing me, fuck!
This ain't a test nigga no pencils, only ink
And blood splattered like your toes on my drink
The dream shattering girl
Without collateral earls
Unimaginable, chatter like a lateral curls
Tight expanding your world
And my mic can just spike this gang
Like a roofie or a volleyball move like in the aim
To get analogies right, you dumb as 
Mallory
 right?
The Jeanie smarter than you thought at first apparently, right?
Please don't be mad at me, i'd rather be liked
Cause your opinion really matters automatically, psyche!
I give a fuck about what you can think that you ain't get the plus
My pimp lean is cool, back up like these blacks on the bus
School niggas. School. You learn! Get your learn on!
We finna teach you something!
Justice League, Brooklyn Academy, we're all making records!
Pumpkinhead, we still family yeah!
We bring it down like this from New York to Kaki-laki
Kick back, and flick your wrist
This shit got me mumbling, should we bring it back?
Mad dub pour it like the flow without the chorus
We get the love from the Joneses and Jazzy, N.O.R.E.'s
Border cross in, transporter, illegal drugs
So much that pass porters in need of illegal tucks

And at the same time just be cool all of you just be cool
Bitch I’m taking calls no small talking
Author out the basement somebody dog walk them
I’ve been Mr. MC since Chris Walken had a watch up his ass
Now I talk trash as I gain small fortunes
I've had shitty times yet I’m still getting mines
Everything is awesome misery loves company
So Cathy met Norman when I’m done performing
People go listen to Tanya Morgan Katherine who’s apple
Know master Ace though a legend still dropping
I’m just carving out the place rapping a new chapter I
Huge out space where alien choose knocking
I do not record a case I sung while sam son do
I rise moms and the moms and the moms do the newbies
I won’t be in Billy Berg juicing my dad starts shooting
The cops came I’m the main Lugant
I’m heading for the things I’ve only seen in my dreams
Since mama gave birth to the 2015
And yes I get scare for 2016
Crown king while you at home making meal

New nickname; .38 Special, the wildcard
I told them porta medals is the only men that will cry
Fitted with 6 laps long agents and 5 brows
Senegal peddy gol and it can make lines crawl
Mythical monster monster rap menital
Momma was a renegade renaissance repping broad
So I bend low skip line if he knew he said he ball
Hit lines they competitive and it cause
And then it’s nine come and then amenity gone
It’s a small spirit but it’s all been for me to be barbaric
Work with my pallbearers with you all steering
Remember I was the fore mother before an era apparent
I represent the music outcast never a spit legend
It just happened hit the fine sound on the boston
I show what the sound like at the same time
They all call for wrong things you can get your horse
From next door then hit the panic button when I’m playin
3 laying porn man lowing jam that I made now finish

Yo yo you all slack you all locals when I rap ya’ll vocal
I’m a Black guy noble that king go soulful
Mr sling sling local wise words is don’s work
My Prides hurt my prides verse cops perk
While worth but it is worthwhile ain’t it B
Picturing picking you be guess which frame fit
And he quit do the math and when he subtract the subpart
And add me to the playlist fake fans favourite
Afraid of it afraid my rhymes sting supreme
See I leave a grey page you gotta go slane
See I’m like santa when he stands up for the rest of us
This is festive I’m scandalous and we stand so we can celebrate
That mark it’s that a sending in for sure I took
That metaphor too deep I made it far

Hard bars drop full of hard R’s
The dream is what we fending on
And I’m going to guard hard
Scared arms for the strong
Go hard and I haven't checked my phone since
The song started the snapchat showing back facts
Nash cracking tacks and I guess I need to end this
I’m way too distracted

Today's tale takes place in a small little town called New York City
So tiny if you blink, you might just miss it

How 'bout you go and sit on back
And I'll play you a little tune while my good buddy Jean here sings you a song
Heck, you may just learn a thing or two

It's as cold as a witch's tit that winter day that day 
When I'm texting my friends 
We have learned to meet downtown to break some bread
It was Ann and Vern and Mary Ann all on the thread
When we sat and laughed and ate and drank and hung around for hours
Stayed 'till after closing and we broke out our guitars
So for the life and love of music, bourbon, and good food
Took so many pictures, not to save them would be rude
Woke up down for sunset the next day
Charged my phone with all the pictures right away
(Ha ha, Instagram!)
I was so happy we could share 
So I cropped them, builded them, tilted through them down
And then posted a caption 
And please be a normal person, don't be negative
We had such a great time, and then I put the name of the restaurant
And then, so you guys could have a similar experience if you want
(Your welcome!)
One hundred and ten people posted likes
And Mary Ann, Vern, and Anna all reposted thrice
But then some stupid dick who doesn't know how to read
Typed ""four roses is garbage, you already have to leave""

You don't have to drink what's in the picture
It's a digital representation of my time
Unless you get your nutrients from other people's lives
You don't have to drink what's in the picture
And you don't have to eat what's in the picture
Goddamnit, this is just something that I enjoyed in life
If you fuckin' don't like food, then a post and here's some nudes

Fathered him in ways of no shame, erased his honest and re-

Niggas who make hot beats and my dogs who spit venom
My thugs and gentlemen, from vanilla to cinnamon
The first thousand women ( ? ) from N'Sync to Eminem

Don't stop, I said you won't stop
And if you with me, then we ride until the beat drop
Who got the Henny, yo? Sip it, sip it
Hydro, hit it, hit it
And all my hungry niggas, please yo, don't stop, get it, get it
Don't stop, I said you won't stop
And if you with me, then we drink until last shot
Who got the hydro? Hit it, hit it
Who got the Henny, yo? Sip it, sip it
All my hungry niggas, please yo, don't stop, get it, get it

A new representative, presentin Jean Grae
Customer, client, president, fuck Gen X, we today, nigga
It's hostile today, hot loans and baby mamas to pay
Hot rocks for dollars to sway
What's your hustle, I'm doin mine
And if it don't work - fuck that, it got to
The rhymes too hot to experience how not to
I'm toxic like vodka and gin
200 proof on the rocks, I do it cause I can
Simple, you should stop and I told you who I do it for
And I'm not goin anywhere cause me and life is married and I ain't gettin divorced
So where my hungry women at, my niggas ready to set it
We can all eat, what you need, let's go get it",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-get-it-lyrics
Falling Down,iSweatergawd ,UnKnown,"I watch sky
All in the mind

Marriage don’t last but it will never seem course
So she buried all the past like it was never before
It’s all battling the last thing never what you thought
Love I try to stop them from extending the knowledge
Possibly copying everything from her at 74
So love will never lose the faith oh
I want my active back bad
Daily it has been flying in the empty glass man
Back there with disappointment and stress
Still I need appointment apply it like an ointment
Before august fuck that thought
If you still supplying that arrogance fuck that mom
She on fluxed out dad not another dime
I wish the side of we because we don’t fear
See the top course bombing into Tedo’s grave
Whathinc your childhood heroes disappear like
Watching children fall to villain and
All criminal deacons on the floor
They will preach the wrong cause because there
Is demons on the wall when they crawling
Off the altar to the people

Now you thought you wake up in better places
You out here looking for leaders you the faithless
Out here looking for teachers and searching encyclopedia
You ain’t going to see it without the hard drive to do it
This ain’t no trick baby they on the safety they ain’t going to do it
Baby going to take the face to it
I know it and you know it
You ain’t know it concrete jungle
The unmark race for them
My people is another on me
Doubles going to take more rounds to
Solve these troubles
After that and you also know the key in the car
Over the night and the table will fuck it
Like believers number
Imagine that was tomorrow shit
I will get the map and we will leave our car on
We gotta be hitting the back of sorrows
So we just flip it back and leave the card on watch
Flip it back and leave the card on watch
But seen some things you need",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-falling-down-lyrics
Bits (pt. 2 - The Fear),Gotham Down Deluxe,2013.0,"Sometimes, melancholy appeasement
Is better than the feeling in my head
I'm trying to lean towards betterment
I'm trying not to feel forced sentiments
It's kinda like the cinammon challenge
Everyone's like, ""I can do it!"", then you're spitting and off-balance
And balance is key for your battles, you ask me
The last three to battle me just balanced on asphalt
And that ass fell
I as well, dry spell, desert
Cos I don't do invaluable endeavours
So I'd rather be present and president
Of my tail feathers by my goddamn self, hm
Clever, yes I am
My letterman jacket is the whole damn alphabet
The Greek-Roman alphabet
Heiroglyphs
, 
Malkovich, climb inside my mind
And have some Alpha-Bits
We could do calculus
Yes I have a calibre
I don't take phallus or  status over conversation stamina
Not hummina-hummina conversation stamina
I mean common denominator chatter
Interests, teach me something
That keeps me wanting to keep learning to keep coming
Back for more,
 score, 
flaws, don't see 'em
If we got the foundation
I don't want the concealer or the make-up or the base
Oh lord, trace me like you're applying for art school
I'll sit on a stool, ask questions
It's pleasant when somebody has attention centered
We all want a bit of orbiting
Nobody wants to be the morbid maudlin
I like to be around your frame often
I should tell you more
Consider this the place card I put in my hand with my heart
I'll probably leave it adjacent to your hand
So I don't damage it far, because it's hard
But my main intentions are...

Slices of me cross-sectioned like tree trunks
Open for your reading if you need or want
Feeling all jittery
And my placement of arms is less than suave
I guess it's odd, I'm normally very nonchalant
So mazel-tov on that
For throwing me off my guard, hard
So I'm automatically audibly sort of ""Oh, drat""
Caught up in old patterns
Some days I wake up like, today it's gonna happen
I'll embrace him in the way, there's no evasive action
And then I'll tell him all the ways he makes my state enraptured
Face him to face with absolute and base attraction
But it's more, so I fail
Capital ""F"" circled with a red pen
And a tail-note saying ""64,""
""Just tell him he's the one and you could pass the shit course""
But I freeze up and never do more
He's that memory card
That I keep turnin' over, hopin' that it'll match
I got a keep it pretty sober man, whenever we pass
I wanna need him in the fall
The future, the past
Fuckin' 5.30pm, 3.20am, noon
Whenever everything is, whenever it's not, too
Whenever we're just energy
I'm getting existential
But he makes me wanna get pencils and fill out Scantrons
Write things, take walks, visit a damn farm
Be calm, be a mom...
A bit of a jump there, yes
Apologies for that though, truth
Ain't no better quality to boost
If I lose him to somebody it's because
I never really had him
And my love is fantastic
So it's fear
Nothing in the universe comes close, my dear
Pedantic, romantic, hopeless
Maybe he'll just hear this now and know this...
Maybe he'll just hear this now and know...",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-bits-pt-2-the-fear-lyrics
Fyre Blazer,This Week,2004.0,"Let's begin: Miss Grae
The post-traumatic war symptom sufferer
The player, hand-bluffer, the shifty-eyed mother
Deep city strut-walker, trucker hat hater
Knuckle up a peddle rap pusher
Made veteran face-smusher
Rip out your pacemaker
Knock your brain data
With block fists 'til it spits out of your sockets
So unlogical, the prodigal daughter returns
With them horror comic comedy terms (You know you love it)
Squirm in your seats, let the bass burn you to pieces
Frown 'til your face keeps all those permanent creases
Learned leash techniques so I keeps them all close
Then I burn all the straps, slack, and watch you toast
Drop on ya like ""Oh Donna""'s playing ""La Bomba,"" comma
Now your kin's wilin' like Ritchie Valen's mama drama
Picture me smiling—man, it's all in the words
I'm just playing, please don't take this serious
I'm just saying, come on

Featherweight with a heavy tongue, eighty pounds
And it's fitted with napalm grenades with the pins out
I spit a round of ammo and spin, light candles
Dig holes manually or I hop to your family
You can't manage me, I'm Santana's song
""Black Magic Woman,"" half manic, half timebomb
Neurotic addicts blown—that alone explains that I'm wrong
I stay gone like missing kids in a basement with chains on
Face it—I'm always gonna lace it up well
Receive hate mail, then pray tell why your face swelled
I don a cape with a ""JG"" on it, the sleeves red
Three lead pieces that'll pop out of the sleeve net
(Best believe that) I mean what I say cause these letters spray
With a mean pimp lean, Jean—I'm a demon
""I know, she's so dreamy, look at her gleaming!""
Nigga, I shine with no polish, uneven—it's just raw (See?)

Despicable thoughts much bigger than yours
I think in broad-terms, long-term winnings of course
I figure long earnings:
Yachts and Porsches, houses, porches, backyards, pools and stay remorseless for this
Y'all think that I don't endorse it?
That I wanna stay broke, drinking water out the faucet?
Nope.  That's where you're wrong
I just planned it different.  Damn gifted
'Til all the up and ante shifted
I'm a nightmare, flipping the standards, rip it candid
Tipping the balance, one hand gripping the hammer
And dripping rancid tones.  You're just a band of clones
I strip you down 'til you're living in abandoned homes
Plan long—you're up short like bandana tops
My plan stops when my kids' kids' nanna drops
Then my grandkids find your family—god damn thee
I'll quit when I sell y'all candy that can't see",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-fyre-blazer-lyrics

(UH OH! UH OH! UH OH!) Oh! Uh, you know the word is back

Psychopath, ride a tricycle in a biker's club
Mike Tyson face tatted addict, like it rough
Hey scatterbrain, don't get your gray matter punched up
'Til you hunched, talk-talkin' like you punch drunk
One love, two maybe if I'm drunk enough
Naked watchin' three painted ladies do the bump and rub
Mean muggin' Jean, the Heebs call meshugenah
Bookin' her in the Catskills like ""look at her rap skills!""
He's rockin' a backpack, a nerd in the rat pack
Jean Martine de Begerac, you heard of her murder rap
I murder rap, you learn it, confirm it and burn its audio
Music for your convertible, music for burnin' cardio!
Don't use it for burners, they'll find me in your stereo
And blame me for the murders, lock me up and get me carried off
I know I said murder befo' - murder murder, FUCK IT murder
Make it fo', insert a learning curve
Mine is so high you get vertigo, assertive girl a-fern a blow
Eternally superlative, blindfolded learn to drive
At night up on a girder bridge, heard a ""NO!""
Talib dirty nervousness, yes the boys are back
Oh yes the boys in black, the boy's ? rap star
Teeny rock star, minus the f'real and all the cop cars
Rocks off, lock bars with the realest (hach-too) in the spot

Crips throwin' gang signs, the beast in the street
Bearin' teeth like a canine, low like the bassline
Jean and Kwe' think alike like great minds
The crown is on my head, what makes you think that you can take mine?
They know they'll never win but still they racist like a hate crime
Runnin' track like Tyra in Higher Learning
We bleeding gasoline so we keepin' the fire burnin'
We speedin' like Valvoline and we speak fo' a higher purpose
You believe in magazines that deliver entire sermons
Give me some Vaseline cause your shit is dryer than deserts
You never fired a weapon in your life
So picturin' yourself as a gangster the only way that you shootin'
And my intelligent design is a product of evolution
Psychotic, erotic, catch phrases just to, get at your girl
Create solutions for a digital world
So baby even when I'm spittin' game I'm addin' on
Rappers goin' hard pure for the dope, I got an acronym for Capricorn
Said to them prepared, rigorous, innovative
Captivatin', ordinary, regular, nigga just
Throwin' daily your chick goin' crazy yo
Handle her like Chelsea Lately
Rockin' the fresh kicks like you felt her baby
We'll wait until you done bein' whack
We got every hand up from the front to the back
If you wonderin' why you just dressin' funny in rap
You need attention dog, there ain't no more, money in rap
So if you're mixin' with Garage Band, videos on the Flip cam
I'm a big fan you got more heart than Bret, he hitman

Where the pall bearers with
My casket doing the two step
The jungle bully get down get down
One single solitary flap to find a place
To put on the ground you can send the
Vultures from the clouds till they crowd
Around me like a falling army
Jean don’t get morbid on me cause
I can’t stop and we got the base of profit
Don’t stop silence relied on myself to find
The lions just another human being but the
Thoughts dying out when is the flower out
When does the hope die hear my doubt now
Just fired out heart stream violent and quiet down
Where we use to hearing choirs where it’s quiet now
Where I use to get inspired and just write it down
Two names in the middle and the end man
I don’t buy it now tired of  browsing of battered cows
Want the house in martebra right grapes childhood
Prices pull the margin on my face like its was just a
Suggest tyrese was in depth of giving advice please
My higher goals have never been to fly alone
Getting shot down like friendly-fire, fuckin' die alone
So there it is in plain terms; laymens
Throw myself off a fuckin' boat in the Caymans

Maybe I’m waiting for the morning
And I’ve gone too far often
I’m going to throw down again
I’m going to throw

""Since I was 15 I have been waiting where is he
Who the white guy
That only happens in fairy tail
My head hurts
Do you ever think that we are the white knights
And we are the ones that have to save ourselves
That is so depressing""

I vow to never kill again
Scare of cops spin a friend
I grabbed the murder weapon I’m off the grid
Wrap it up buried at the den the movies make it seem so cool
Well life really is a sitcom for fools
Should like to coat over debate I’m like yea
Stay true to the program even though I know
I hate them it’s the same
Ah to bear some young ladies is a pain
We remain lonely until we remain for
The rest of our day like lone star
The oldest story in the book
What a goof it’s always nice until you get to the
It’s missing just right now
No future now first it is self now
Them I’t you of all these fear these everlove
Of all this love while I’m up on the loophole
Scared scared there’s a terry in place to be
I got people that do some other terrible things
To me another ice cream and A terrible place for me
These dreams left a whole lot stream for me
I think I know my place in this rat race
I need to just call the quits and say thanks
Who finished last is the realest of the Illest
And I keep them running and together they are
Given a name

Maybe I’m waiting for the morning
And I’ve gone too far often
I’m going to throw down again
I’m going to throw
Maybe I’m waiting for the morning

Soda & Soap,The Orchestral Files,2008,"I met this girl named Fantasy on wall street
From Tahedi, real Tahesian treat
She had a lot of ""pep see"" honey was peace
And she told me she liked my smile like shy niece
She danced at this club and made the guys holler
And in a ""minute made"" like a thousand dollars
The club that was run by ""Mr. Schweppes"", he had a rep
And everybody watched they step
Cuz word on the street was he was no joke
Had everything from crack, marijuana to ""coke""
Later at the club saw this guy named Wayne
Who always bettin' money on the Giants game
As soon as it's on yo I stayed away
Cuz he the type who ""welches"" a bet and won't pay
I keep tryin' to tell him be a straight stepper
Somebody gonna ""slice"" him and send him a ""Dr. Pepper""
Went to the bar checked the score
Got the bartender told him what to pour
He put it on my ""tab"" as he filled my cup
And told me the game was tied ""7up""
Around 12 o'clock she came out to dance
Had all the guys pushing just to have a chance
To spend a little money trying to see the rest
She was blessed, in an ""orange crushed"" velvet dress
But I stayed by the bar cuz I already know how it go
I already saw the show
See I went to a club like this in Toronto
And came back from ""Canada dry"" with no dough
And ever since then I see and see clear
You never find love in this atmosphere
Sometimes you gotta find a better place to be in
Maybe go to a ""mountain do"" a little skiing
So I finished up my drink and I said goodbye
And got home before the ""sun kissed"" the sky
No matter where you from or which way you leaning
Now goin' pop got a whole new meaning

Don't you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here
No it ain't Nelly but it's ""Hot In Here"", we got it locked in here
Won't stop (you know), come and drink in numbers like h2o
Soon you gonna hear us everyplace you go
Bubble like the soda kinda like the soap
I just hope you know, it don't stop

The Y2k is a brand new ""era""
I'm tryin' to make hits like Yogi Berra
I wonder how long I'll be in this biz
Cuz it's not all ""cheer"" like you think it is
There's a whole lot to ""gain"" but a lot to lose
Just ask any rapper who paid dues
Everybody now and then bound to struggle
I just grab my wife and we lay and ""snuggle""
We talk about the ""ivory"" coast how one day
We gonna sail on the ""tide"" and get ""whisk""ed away
Look up at the stars 'til the crack of ""dawn""
Hold up I never leave your side for long
But for now I keep on making you ""bounce""
And make ""sure"" something in my checking accounts
Grab my cell phone and then start to ""dial""
Take a look at my life and start to smile
It's funny how the game make you change your tone
Cuz the ""joy"" of my life is the microphone
So I straighten up my act and keep doin' my thing
Gettin' the green nahimean getting it clean

Don't you know we got a lot in here
Wanna be a part of what we got in here
Sorta like we got the whole block in here
No it ain't Nelly but it's ""Hot In Here"", we got it locked in here

August 20th,iSweatergawd ,UnKnown,"It's a spiritual advice
So I’m always home
Like I took everything in
And that’s the coming home
I am here and because
We seen all the real things
And that’s what makes me different

August 2013 was sun filled
Shot through the atmosphere
With the running veil
Dropped through the sky and
Landed in my heart square
And possibly am not speaking
For physically here get the flow
With the full force of ask God’s
Hammer hot sauce that opens
Force like I argued on the forth
And elius on the koch arrow
With the cops staring with them
Blocks glaring rocks selling
Breath leaving me like it’s autumn
Caught up for this moment
But this feeling is falling off
Don’t know who I am in the
Moment I don’t know who I am
In the moment this voice keeps
Talking on

My spirit talks into a crawl space
Door left infloated in infinite all states
Undefinable anesthetic just coursed
Through me and  the person I thought
Would suit me sat across the room
I came through the glue and felt the
Fabric of my heart strings
Spitting hard disintegrating into
Dark matters but come start these missiles
As my soul spasmed  saw the God particle
Visible I can’t stand up as the darkness crept
Into me and my bond shadowed kept on
Losing it again and moving automatic
Washing dishes as my vision blurred
Robotic status mixing with slipping in bitches
On the mattress living bullet shot into my wound
And hit the skin and tore the way inside
And ripped my flesh apart and targeted my
Inner child left her on the side of the road
Bitch is bleeding out let my evening
Breathe it out

No time for dying
Just stay with me
So maybe seem to lose
You went to college
That is the way it was
And she say you should
Know your place she
Know your place and
You find your place
I know things that I
Was not supposed to know
I don’t like people who are
Listening and I really think about
What advice don’t know what
To do but I do nothing that I
Want to do
They want something from us
So you know what I use to
Just you know no one really
Gave a damn whether I was
Singing or not right
But I used the place
Platform and I went against it
And I said I’m going to sing
A couple songs every night
When was I introduced in 1963",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-august-20th-lyrics
Looking Free,iSweatergawd ,UnKnown,"I pray to you father gee
Oh engineer to take these clouds away
Keep asking for back taxes
I could do for brighter days
What you see is make believe
Sometimes I just sit and cry
When it comes to DNA life this is him and saving life
We celebrate big baby Jesus
On November 10 and 5
My last time they laid me off
Unemployment kept me high
I give thanks to marijuana from the streets of legalize
Since I trust in form a balance whether  trial
I could use a fucking hug or a fucking a good bye
Time ain’t never been on my side
Even though I’ve spent it all my life
Look at me look at me
Living fly living free
Doing anything I want
Getting nothing that I need
Look bro this ain’t fucking prison
This is peace look how the folks living
We got  by the boatloads and it’s free
Hope you ain’t planning to age old gracefully

Look at me looking free 
Look at me

Every day I wake up
Wonder why I’m waking up
Every fucking time I’m waking up
Ain’t no time debating bro
I made this bed with an understanding that everything’s safer
Neighbors are asking favors facing the choice of the reaper
Self disciplinarian no boss to plan
Ain’t nobody gonna care when you’re forgetting my name
I wish for hours and clocking and lunch and
Office parties
I wish for flowers and docking for punching late and tardy
I cry when I ride free fall
It’s got a start and ending
You disbelieve I'm free though
The worst of the job is pretending
Grass greener get your glass cleaner wash your house
Scheming and arena where there’s never ours
But look at me looking free
Easing down the road
Breathing now seeing amazing things wielding the globe
Look at me looking free, looking free, right?

Look at me looking free 

""When you are in a creative industry

This is someone with a tattoo of my face on their arm
This is very strange and very surreal
But it did not really make me feel like I had any word
But there are so many things that people don’t talk about when they are in their jobs
They don’t talk about their amazing careers and they don’t put it on Facebook
How actually you can cry at night about how hard it is to take that passion
And turn that into a career when that passion is all you have in life
What happens when all of a sudden that passion has to pay your rent""",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-looking-free-lyrics
Henn Rock Blues,UnKnown,2001.0,"To hell with gold and riches, niggas and bitches
Don't even want 'em—all I need is you (I love you too)
See, we was meant to be.  Eventually, we man and wife
Livin’ in sin for years, chillin’ like shots of gin and beers
You the one who gets me high when I need it
We fight when we're together.  Cry sometimes, but never sever ties
Where would I be without you in the club with me?
At home, stuck up in the zone, straight pissy
We shifty.  Together, we're complete—there's no other one for me
I smoke sometimes but really prefer your company (You don't really mean that)
Yes I do.  Baby, listen.  Who keeps you in the cup and never on the floor?
Who's checking for you soon as I'm walking up in the door?
Who never stopped asking you, ""Baby, give me some more?""
Please, I love the way you pour out whether store bought or free
It's just you and me (Say my name, say my name!)
Brown and beautiful, smooth, intoxicating
It's illegal but still holding you in the street
We play until the bar close
I take you home.  You taste sweet
Except for that part where I throw you up all over my clothes

Yo, I got this problem (what?).  Can you help me?
(Why?  She's in love with the bottle of the Hennessy)
The shit just ain't right, I gotta make it stop
(Ayo, she in love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
Ayo, you can't be with me.  Bitch, you must be tipsy)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Hennessy
(Yo girl, this shit ain't right.  Yo, you gotta make it stop)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Henn Rock

Hey, what's up?  How ya feel?  You're cold, looking hot
It's your main shit stain, the big Henny Rock
Why don't you cop a squat and sit right next to me
So we can talk about the birds and the bees
Let me grab on those tits and you can grab on these
Sexually and mentally, I love yo steez
When you drink a fifth of me right in the club
You didn't need no motherfucking cup
That's what I like about you—you don't give a fuck
Yo, I gotta get with you, girl—that's a must
Even though the night is about to end
You know you walking out with your main man Henn
The realest of the real, the coolest of the cool
When you drink a shot of me, it goes down smooth
So hey baby girl, I know you ain't no fool
It's almost that time, so what we gon' do?

I know this after fo' spot that's banging
Maybe we'll do a little drunk karaoke singing
You got me stumbling, spitting, and cursing
All up in my 40 nursing
Swerving into people, pissin’ on the church when
We spendin’ the night.  I'm never light weight
We, like, date-every evening.  Fiending for you like a junkie demon
So let's collaborate and go to bars and break rules
Smash bats and cars and shit.  You the only one I wanna be with

Yo, I got this problem (what?).  Can you help me?
(Why?  She's in love with the bottle of the Hennessy)
The shit just ain't right, I gotta make it stop
(Ayo, she in love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
Ayo, you can't be with me.  Bitch, you must be tipsy)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Hennessy
(Yo girl, this shit ain't right.  Yo, you gotta make it stop)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Henn Rock

Hey baby, that's cool.  I wanna be with you, boo
Henny Rock anytime, any day after school
Beginning of the church, even the early morn'
Henny gon' be with you till the day is dawn
You made me hurl.  You made me snuff my girl
You made me even curse my moms, but you still my world
I love the way you smell, the way you give 'em hell
And if I cheat on you, know that I got to tell
Ayo, you bugging out right now ‘cause you ain't telling nobody
This a fifth of liquor you talking to—this ain't Bacardi
This motherfuckin' Henny Rock.  Cool out and chill
Can I see you next week around five until?
If I could marry you and go up on a honeymoon
Put you in a glass, dance to our favorite tune
But it could never happen with us—I know we can't do it (why?)
Well for one, I'm human and you're fluid

Yo, I got this problem (what?).  Can you help me?
(Why?  She's in love with the bottle of the Hennessy)
The shit just ain't right, I gotta make it stop
(Ayo, she in love with the bottle of the Henn Rock
Ayo, you can't be with me.  Bitch, you must be tipsy)
But I'm love with the bottle of the Hennessy

Have you contemplated deep in your words inside your craw

Hold U,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I will never forget the day that we first met
I wasn't even feelin you then but worse yet
I was all up in the mix with one of your friends
And when you seen us you would always give me one of your grins
Like if I only knew what I was missin
I would quit kissing on this chick and change my position
I really thought you and my man was a better match
I never thought you was the type that I could catch
I used to see you out in the park with different cats
Them big willie types that rocked them pimp hats
Had every other guy on the block trying to get you
Wishing that they had that rap to get with you
Felt you was out of my league
Its like if you was silk and linen then I was fatigue
I never would have pictured you and me together
But its like the way I hold you we was meant to be together
Come on


The way I hold you it feels so good (yeah)
I don't ever wanna let you go(a-ha)
Can't see you with nobody else, (no)
I just really had to let you know,(yeah)
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you
It's the way I hold you

Now I spend most of my time just being with you
Early on I was afraid to be seen with you
Cuz I knew cats would do anything they could
To stop us from being together, its all good
They was mad cuz I got you and they didn't
Some even tried to approach me I'm not kidding
Had to be ten times I got into a fight
With niggas tried to say I wasn't hitting it right -
They kept on hating just kept on waiting
Hoping that we'd break up but we kept dating
Never knew it would be so hard to be with you
I should make it easy on my self and just quit you
[Make it easy on myself x2)
I need to make it easy on my self
Yup, I need to make it easy on my self
Yup, I need to make it easy on my self
And just leave you alone
No Wait! When I hold you if feels so great
I realize and recognize that you're my soul mate
Its us forever had to let you know
Its like I told you imma hold you never let you go
Come on

One-Two check it
You should have known from way back I tried to amp you
Try to speak on your skillz when other niggas felt me
But you know that if you wasn't with me they can't even hear you right
And if you try to snatch me up it'd probably turn into a fight
I been through my phases with cats and shakes
I know you seen me chillin' with fake players
Who tried to grab me in the club and dance with me on the stage in gators
They say you just hatin
-you jealous of the money that they're makin
Peep stripper broads, thugs in golds and punks
Cats would front, get me high with all the smoke from the blunts
Its not love its just lust
They always put me down when shit gets rough
I can't do it alone, I need someone to hold me right tell me their feelings
Speak on us to they boys, that's why we dealin
Niggas startin rumors like we ain't chilling or split up
When you've been writing poems for me just to shut they lip up
And there's still cats who try to touch me when they spot me alone
Try to tap me just to see if im turned on
But it's the way you speak to me
Its like we on the same frequency
And when you hold me, you make peak
Come on",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-hold-u-lyrics
Very Sad Things,The Official Bootleg,2003.0,"Teacher:  Ahem.  Hi, kids.  Today, we have a special guest for story time
Student: Bo-ring
Student: I don’t want to stay here.  This sucks
Teacher:  Ms. Jean Grae.  Go ahead, Ms. Grae.  They’re all yours
Student: Can I go the nurse’s office?
Teacher: Listen, Bobby, sit down
Jean Grae: OK, OK
Student: You’re not Eve
Jean Grae: No, I’m not Eve.  Hehe
Student: Can I go to the bathroom?
Teacher: No, you can’t go the bathroom
Jean Grae: Anyway, I’ve got a little story to tell.  Everybody just settle down.  Here we go

Black Nova rims.  Sun shining, ’99 summertime
June 4th, 85 on I-95 North
Headed back, sitting down.  Two bodies in the trunk
Hostage in the backseat.  Breast stopped beating
Take her in the bushes, peeing.  Black-tank-top-sporting
.44, toting two 9s, glove box, fly’s open
Gas, slow cash flow, hostage in Krylon
Coat on the dashboard, smoking a glass-closed cockpit
Passenger’s seat holding the icepick
The blood splash, the seat’s drenched in plasma
Girl gasp while the punk scream.  She got asthma
Crying teen out the window pronto
Exhale deep thoughts in the backseat console
Close it up, choke her out, laugh ‘til it hurts
Dump her on the side of the road.  Fuck it, throw the car in a
Lake most shallow, carve three notches in my face
Head up to the church in a small town, blaze it
Run while it burn, break into a near basement
Torch it.  Two pyro acts.  Sit on the lawn
Watching people scatter out, pop ‘em one by one
‘Cause I’m lawless, where random acts of violence soothe me
Then I pause, pull the .44 and cock it to me
Then I launch lead straight and paint the grass red
Story time over.  Game over.  Kids, the end

Teacher: Haaa!  I am so offended
Jean Grae: Yeah.  You like the story?
Student: Can I pee?
Teacher: I’ve never been so shocked in my life
Jean Grae: I’m for the kids.  (*Crying*) Shut up!
 (x2)
It’s bad things.  Very bad things
So be scared, get prepared for what’s happening
Grab your dolls and your teddy bears, everything
Check your beds and your closets and play things
And parents.  It’s bad dreams.  Very bad things
Very bad things.  Very bad things (I’m scared)

Jean Grae: Oh, look at me.  I’m just a little kid.  I can’t take the story.  Shut up and listen to the story!  You wanted a story?  Here’s the story.  Listen, damn it!
Student: I want my mommy!
Student: Can I go home now?

Jenny was an A student on the way to school
She passed a van and a man jumped out
Offered her candy, said he handed it out to good girls and
Can she take a ride with him and his daughter Nancy?
But Jenny’s not stupid, so she walks along
On the side of the road alone, looking for cops.  The van
Drives off.  Jenny’s scared, screeches occur
Her lunchbox drops.  She stoops.  Hands grab, she’s snatched
In the front of the van, she sits tied up
While twelve kids pile, playing backseat driver
They drive for days and eat nothing but some Blow Pops
Sodapops, Ritz, and Lays, and many
Kids pass out.  Jenny doesn’t.  Tend to your cousin
Plenty tears.  Plenty cussing.  Plenty fussing
Plenty beaten.  Plenty molested.  Plenty bussing
Jenny missing two weeks.  She getting weak.  Four
Kids pass.  Snatch five more from the streets
He wears a mask at night.  A fucking bastard case
He should be shot to death.  He should be locked away
So Jenny’s got the plan, gathers up the kids
When he sleeps, creeps up, gets a knife and jigs
Screams, “It’s not right!”  Stops him.  “Everybody
Run for your life!”  (So what happened?)
The cops never got him (No!)
 (x2)
It’s bad things.  Very bad things
So be scared, get prepared for what’s happening
Grab your dolls and your teddy bears, everything
Check your beds and your closets and play things
And parents.  It’s bad dreams.  Very bad things
Very bad things.  Very bad things (I’m scared)

Jean Grae: Yeah, I know you’re scared.  All right.  I, I’m leaving... No, I’m not.  I’m just kidding.  There’s another one and this one’s worse than the others.  Little Susie, dry your eyes.  Aww, look at you.  Did Jenny pass out?  Ho ho!  Funny!  Let’s go!

New town, new kid, new victim
At school.  Billy Smith, the son of a dentist
Wears braces, wack shoes, tight laces
When he eats, the kid makes funny faces
Taped glasses.  Likes his math classes
No friends.  They just stay kicking his ass.  This
One kid play nice with him.  Mike Pippen
Billy’s mom invites him over for chicken
And stovetop stuffing—you know, real suburban
House picket fence, white dog, mom in apron say
“Dinnertime, boys.”  Billy just run upstairs
“I got toys!”  Mike follows.  They playing
With Jango and Solo, Jabba and Yoda
Giggling, beating up Leia and Amidala
“Billy, come downstairs.  It’s your father”
They break north down the stairs.  Intercom buzzes
Billy’s dad rushes in, grabs Mike
Knocks him ‘til his head just pops right in
One hour later, they all sitting ‘round the dinner table
Minus Mike, who’s getting carved up lovely
Served with a little rice pilaf and bubbly

Student: What happened to him?
Jean Grae: Oh no, that means they ate him, kids
Student: No!
Jean Grae: They carved him up and ate him like the little boy that he was
 (x2)
It’s bad things.  Very bad things
So be scared, get prepared for what’s happening
Grab your dolls and your teddy bears, everything
Check your beds and your closets and play things
And parents.  It’s bad dreams.  Very bad things
Very bad things.  Very bad things (I’m scared)

Jean Grae: So kids, tell all your parents to go out and cop that new Jean Grae album, play it right before you go to bed.  Love ya.  See you later.  Sorry, your teacher’s waiting.  Some things have to happen.  Alright.  Good night
Student: I don’t want to go to school again

Cliche,SAIX ,UnKnown,"You dyed my heart in a rainbow
Feelings and colors are the same
I never thought it was simple
The joy in just saying your name
(Love) in your orbit I'm your satellite
(Oh) Above the clouds, out of sight
I never thought I could feel this way
Unexpected just like how people say
(Love) Makes me want to sing this to the world
(Love) Makes me wanna

Love, homes in all types of shapes and shades and colors
You know how this feels, la la la…la
I know it kinda feels strange
You say that my heart skipped a beat, two beats
The moment you came my way, la la la…la

I can admit I was cynical
But you can release believe that I was to blame
Years of learning to let It go
(Oh)  so I won't just live in the pain of love
Unexpected broke the paradigm, till I was yours
You are mine
I never thought I could feel this way
Unexpected just like how people say
I could give up, but don't
Maybe a little bit of bustling, hustling
Little scissors of hope
Never doubt, we just go
We get high, we get by, we get down low
We get bit, we get die, we get grown low
We get life, we get a little better together
We can hope, I get you, you get me, we get through
We get when everybody never wanted us to be the better two
I hope forever's really the infinite years we representing too
Cause now we been together since any place
We already know

Neckface,Dust Ruffle: Songs I Found Under My Bed,UnKnown,"Man, it's business as usual
But trap pubical dirt, that's beautiful
Pass me you'll see Rasputin at work
A fast, furious, mad curious mind
Slant Manchurian eyes
Slap jaw, give a hacksaw lover
Burgle a bank robber
Bumble his plan, invert his revolver
Body bag and tag anonymous man
Brag? I promise to
I'mma do shit that makes you wish you would've been
The human shield for Amadou
Bitch please, my sixteen spit pristine
Like the mouth on a debutante named Christine
Jean, hurricane name, unattained fame, fuck it
My son will be the son of a dame who changed the game, fucker
From the basement to the Kay Slay shit
Lace it, rap braided me a friendship bracelet
You lose, I'm just lukewarm
My true form will be revealed in a few years
When the phoenix swarms
I'm three steps ahead of you, please flex
The medical needs of need next just to breathe jeez god bless
Accomplice none, I'm complex, son
The confidence of Donald Trump mixed with a convict on the run
Compliments of my mama, Miss Benjamin
School teacher slash singer slash rule preacher
Who bet against her daughter being weaker than her
Praise right, trained like fight back Tsidi
So I'm quite likely to strike back (damn right)
I ain't easy to stomach I make them queasy from it
See Greasy causin' discomfort but yo you see they love it
And I'm not threatening y'all yet
The call y'all get is late fall, 2004, bet
Hold up, I sip an XO and then
Scratch out your eyes like I'm playing tic toe with them
Black pride promoting it, but crass when spoken
The Neckface of rap, only New York niggas get that
Tag reference, stash weapons with some brash methods
'Til you shitting brass knuckles
And your ass pucker's past tense
I execute so effortless, the cleverness
Misconstrued as ambivalence, you imbeciles
High level ground, I'm small
But I walk on you heavy George Jefferson, Bentley
Eventually you'll get it, potentially a legend

Jean rock a little girlie shit
That's why my nigga Tech be callin me the greasy pimp
That's why we gotta open bars, snatch tips and bail
Like Jeanie's on a date with fuckin' Dave Chappelle, hell
I always been cool
That's why I move
With a small razor
Taped to the back of the front tooth
That's why I dance hard
Jean, doing the running man in the middle of the dance floor
Game's so cunning
And that's why I'm so cool with restroom attendants
On request, they'll lock you in and hot jock your pendants
Knock, knock, 'til you're blue, like the Titanic necklace
Meanwhile, I'm outside tagging names on your Benzes
Then everybody but my peoples starts to file in
And that's when niggas get tired and start wildin'
And then the cops come through and shut the club down
And that's when I turn around and blame it on you, ow!

You could never fuck with Jean

(This bitch spilled a drink on my clothes!)
See, that's why I told you not to fuck with hoes!
That's why I keep my business clean
I done dirt, trust, flirted with the burden of retarded things
That's why the weed only contacts like osmosis
And if I smoke I'll only do it in small doses
Prognosis
She's iller than these niggas the streets feel her
And so I keep a distance between me and the heat spillers
That's why there's no beef, only buzz
Won't stop 'til I reach MTV or bust
That's why you need me
Please believe me
God, Greasy could have gone these other hoes' routs too easy
That's why you should've known I was approaching fast
That's why I see you in the road and step on the gas
Hard like NASCAR, speed, and toss your weave back
And keep gunnin' 'til the fender dents your knees back

That's why
You could never fuck with Jean
That's why
Y'all ain't nothin' to me

Alright, Jean is chillin'
All of y'all, chillin'
What more can I say?
Stop grillin' me nigga!
I get a drink and fill it with Stoli Vanilla
And paint thinner
And send it to your table with dinner
And that's why you should never cross me
Mark the back of your leather with yellow Xs so the target is clearer
That's why Jean snuck a fuckin' sword in the club
Start carving you up
And not miss a step, thank you
Compliments of the Grae Miss, her statements
Are blatant but I love her, God, I hate her placement
Hatred
That's why I'm on the motherfuckin' A-list
Make you lose faith
Like Biggie or a hundred atheists
Seek refuge, move like a bunch of Haitians
See, that's why I don't be coming out I lose my patience
Too cool and collected
Come boost, with a steady arm

What Cha Gonna Do,Dust Ruffle: Songs I Found Under My Bed,UnKnown,"I got lost caught up and I'm back with the force
And our plan still in force y'all better switch yours
Niggas lame like a door sample said Jean sampled Bread once
I can't front I need to get ahead
Not like hoes kneel to get ahead
I hustle deal till I break through for real
I'm punchy, your walls won't hold me, your boxes won't
Stop this rock on its way to obnoxious
I need to prosper while I preach the gospel
It's the truth and in the booth I'm impossible
On the stage, on the page it's hot so
Dance to it, like it's footloose white boy
Shake it with them crazy moves come on
I can't stand in your shoes
You ain't know, I planted the clues
Damage your crew, steady dismantling you
I panhandle this product if need be
And I'm smart enough to know the industry needs me
I've grown a lot for shows hot niggas don't sleep
The post address for toast without holding heat closely
Watch me run up in your posse
You get gas like the Nazis did
I catch flak like Roberta done dropped and shit
I'm loose lipped so I use it to abuse the music
Leave the track bruised up, all the tracks used up
With the headphones slapped and the volume crunk
So it blasts much better in the truck, oh what
I'm closer this year, New York shed a tear, give it up
What cha gonna do
When they try to take your shit from you

Been a cold winter, 'bout to be a hot summer
And you wondering where Jean is coming from, don't
I propose we worry about where we gonna go
Turn your stereo up, we're one step from spaghetti-o pants shredded
But we're better though
Not a lot of cheddar but now I gotta make the dough
Steady grind mind slipping into petty crime
Back me, I'm not in last have you paying out your ass
Put your game face wrapped in a cask'
The same place that I'm rapping from
Will snatch your tongue and bite it off and snap, you're done
I like drastic moves, nigga run your shoes
What cha gonna do

If I told you in one breath
That my mission is to be the best
Would you mind your business or be impressed
Brush it off, dismiss now that's a test
Are you being fo' real Jean?
Yes, the real dream is the field goal kick with the team, no less
And I'm not playing this just for kicks though
Slay this shit till I kicks and lay low
I say so, but some days I fell off
From this day on I'ma stay the course
Never again play soft, every rhyme is the playoffs
Every time must be memory line sprayed off
You will remember me
I am a contender contrary to what you get generally
I'll take time let it sink in now
You gotta free your mind to the thinking part
You gotta get the signs I'm freaking off
So much shit that my voice starts peaking off
Need this music as much as you
I'm a fan goddamn it and I love it too, so
Wave your hands like the sandman's coming through
But all cheers man, we don't want the boos
In fact fuck that, get up and clap your paws together
Make noise like we wet up the floor, better
Wake up y'all like a Spike Lee flick, good morning boys
I'm the type you leave with, I'm on it

Yeah man, what cha gonna do when the skies starts falling
I be out on the corner ""yes y'all""in
To the blockades and buildings smack pavement
And onlookers gaze in amazement it's hypnotism
Just hitting the rhythm I fuck songs
All up in the bars like prisons are up yours
Like 7 and Grae got infinite new ways
Every minute to infiltrate strong on, eat your spinach
The confidence won't be diminished
Go longer from start to finish now
You spark the inner child
Is dark with an innocent smile
Park your whips like splits listen in for a while, c'mon
What cha gonna do",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-what-cha-gonna-do-lyrics
The Range,SAIX ,UnKnown," I get laid now
Wanted it to be my way
But time won't take it
Baby erase all the rules, yes
Never did well until
Maybe just a fool
You , you, range 
What you mean to me
You, you range
Won't you be with me now
I won't take offense
Baby where we go wrong, ask me bout love
Always is giving hard

SFSC,#5,2014,"Seem so composed, I know the notes I wrote in theory
Repose...
I wish I knew more often than I take it… nearly
Laid in between the sheets in discord of who I am and what my colors bleed
And in the end I know you'll never give me all the things I need
So far, so close, so far
So close
So far, so close
So far, so close
I know I pick the bones I could have left alone...
In theory
No one has traveled this road even though they still stand near me
Caught in between hope and a dream
Though it seems to most that I can see it
Most of these days, morning rays, I've come to deathly fear them
I'm...

My Angel Is You,UnKnown,2008.0,"Yeah, Yeah
La la la la la, la la la la la
Mmm, yeah
La la la la la, la la la la la

Okay, this is the one now, I can finally write it down
It's a requirement I lay it down on this papyrus
Take number three, must say it properly
I could not possibly not drop philosophy
About your Excalibur, sword in the stone
Character strong, black, the bomb
Like double 4 calibers cock-back and blown
When the whole world's on top of me
You always know the right words to keep stopping me
From going, a pearl with a diamond stuck in it
But a girl like me was unsure of infinite bliss
But you broke the myth and closed the drift
'twixt my heart and my senseless, defenseless left
But best friends became 
 intensive trauma, wear armor
Plus, come on, you're my personal Father
Future children call you father
Thank God for you

When this world gets me goin' mad
Everything turns dark shades of blue
And the light turns to darkness
Just when I think I'll never make it through
You save me, my angel is always you
Anything I can say never
Makes you think that I'm crazy
I'm always yours forever
Now pass that little thing known as time
You save me, my angel is always you

Yeah, I had a bout of paranoia, won't lie
About  experience one time
Baggage was serious, marriage, I could've never done it
I wanted trust, but in the truth, man, I was always runnin' out of habit
Folk's passion, I thought their crushin' brought it automatic
I sought relationships that'd turn dramatic
Your patience is the shit, I've learned to pull the brakes
And then the word ""relax"" and live it day to day
And I know I'm crazy, but you put up
With all my insecurities I got a ton of
Plus the way you pursued just made me lose
The tough cool wall I put up to a-avoid the scrapes and bruises
Your smile brings me back from the break of a place where
Ain't sunshine, I used to live most of my days there
We met through the music, mutual friends we cool with
I never guessed that you could save me from this world, the cruelest
But now I'm blessed with an angel that's just as silly stupid
When Cupid shot us a thousand arrows we dropped into it
 and we spoon in the night
I can't believe you're finally here I used to dream what you'd be like
And when we move and get private moments I promise
From the bottom of my heart I'll be honest and always do my part
We'll maintain the dividends, see what tomorrow brings
He changed everything, can't wait for the wedding ring

When this world gets me goin' mad
Everything turns dark shades of blue
And the light turns to darkness
Just when I think I'll never make it through
You save me, my angel is always you
Anything I can say never
Makes you think that I'm crazy
I'm always yours forever
Now pass that little thing known as time
You save me, my angel is always you",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-my-angel-is-you-lyrics

Before The Summer Broke (All Grown Up Version),Gotham Down Deluxe,2013,"I spent about a half'a month
Thinking about the universal laws of karma, bullshit
And all that everybody really wants
To contrast to what they need will make you fuckin’ want to fuckin’ pull clips
From everything you’ve ever seen
Wind it back at half-speed
Just to find the part where niggas lied to you
So check my scene if it applies to you
If not, fuck it; turn it off, bye to you

But anyway, I’m back again
Hope you don't miss me, Black FM
Feet firmly planted in the clouds as always
A sack of dreams deferred, I'll leave em in the hallway
Don’t worry, you won’t have to see em
Coincidence you want the bars, I want my freedom
I guess this is the necessary lead-in
Before the scars, loss, boys, feelings oh gosh
Know when Jeanie be going in on her demons, how far
And not even revealing all the cards
I deal, I dealt with blows beyond the belt, pause
Shit that if I told you, you’d be drinking like myself, god
But I’m all right without a reason to do well, star
My Mama was the last thing I wrote the tales for
Inside I’m tailspinning down with napalm
Strapped to my brain and on my back a flamethrower
Oh, you love it, what you came for
I tell myself that, I don’t really give a fuck what they want
But they paying for it, so pay it forward
Try to think of it like that to save thoughts
I'd be like, I’ll be right back in the same song
Never return and leave the happiest of days more
Cause I don’t get what you be putting me in lanes for
It’s fucking music, what you giving it a name for

I’ve been sayin' everything’s going fine, just takin' some days off
Like everything don’t pay it no mind, been puttin' a face on
But motherfucker, I’ve been goddamn lyin', I’m takin' the grace off
To go back in time, before the summer broke

Well, I guess this is what I aimed for
It's fucking music, what you giving it a name for
I don’t get what you be putting me in lanes for
Never return and leave the happiest of days more
I'd be like, I’ll be right back in the same song
I try to think of it like that, but it seems wrong
Pay it forward, they paying for it
I don’t really give a fuck whatever they want
They love it right, it’s what you came for
I tell myself that, it ain't more
Strapped to my brain, on my back a flamethrower
Inside I’m tailspinning down with napalm
My Mama was the thing I wrote the tales for
I’m all right without a reason, doing well, false
Shit if I told you you’d be drinking like myself, god
How far I got in not revealing all the cards
Oh GOSH
Got Jeanie dishing on her demons
After the scars, loss, boys, feelings
I guess this is the necessary heart bleeding
You want the bars, I want freedom
Dreams deferred, you don’t see ‘em
Keeping my word, so no fleeing
Feet on the ground, always
You can’t stop the wheels of a lost day",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-before-the-summer-broke-all-grown-up-version-lyrics

Iwanteweback (Lush Version),Gotham Down Deluxe,2013,"So dear, so me, so evil you
So we are so through
There's no need, it's over, me and you

I want you back
Sometimes I do
I want you
I need you back
I want you, boo
I want you back
I want you, boo
Though we ain't loving
We ain't fucking
We ain't through
I want you back
I want you back
Oh oh oh oh oh
I want you back

Sometimes I want you back just to adore you
But mostly I just want to destroy you
Store you, and call you Murphy as a nickname
Wipe the floor with you, you're addicting, dick thing
Insane to explain, I know it might sound callous
Careless, sadist, I'm a damn lady
My fair Jeanie ran on planes in Spain daily
Clearly, I'm fairly well-versed in fuckery
I should fuck you up for breaking up with me
Stain your frame of painted veins I bust with cutlery
It's such a shame that you think you're an accessory
You're so fucking pedestrian, especially when you're next to me
Excuse me, sounding too imposing
Fuck it, I'm first class -- I never said I was into coaching
You should listen closely, thinking the song's about you
It is -- you, him, him, and him mostly
Don't choose bad; at times, my choices do betray me
Belaboring the point, yeah, maybe I'm sort of faded
""I'll maybe call you later, baby""; Lord, you're hated
But Lord, of course I'm motivated, low-key hatred
Sleeping neighbors choose euthanasia
Stay together, trooping through the universe forever
I'd rather not be two sedated dapper cadavers
I'd rather feel the pain and tell you never feel embarrassed
It ain't baggage -- I claim baggage like a name tag
It ain't marriage if the gain came through the same fabric
Insane to remain average, I can't have it
My main habit's to change, it creates havoc
You can't fathom a love/hate relation, well
Yes you can, guess again -- you've been aceing them
Replacing them with lying to yourself or fifty pacing them like
Let's get through it, baby
And maybe I'm crazy then for being blunt
I know what I deserve, know what I want
I know that we could never really be a pair
I know that sometimes I still want you there
I might not like you, our connection's rare
I might just spite you, you're never there
I like revenge, I love love
I'm still evolving, that's some shit that Jean is not above",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-iwanteweback-lush-version-lyrics

Jeanie's such a mean girl, Jeanie advance from them
Beating up your team and leave you bleeding 
There's really no competing on this team, don't answer then
Keep your motherfucking green, no gambling
Bumbling, you're mumbling your words just cancel them
'Cause no one cares for them and no one asked for them
And you ain't masculine and I ain't masculine
But then again I'm feminine it comes with the vag 
You know Jean rules
Maybe you can see it from some of these clues
Clever and vegan, I wanna be you, I'm kidding
Me, I'd rather be two girls with a cup
A couple of peeps I fuck with, nothing but love
A couple of freaks I fuck, yep, nothing but love
A couple of geeks I fuck, yep, nothing but love
And in a couple of weeks there'll be a couple of thugs

See, that's me when I walk up in the place, yes
Double fist drinks doing a two step
And everybody knows don't fuck with me, come on
That's me
And that's you when you walk up in the place, nah
Everybody wishing that you would've stayed home
I don't even think you know
That that's you homie
Yeah, that's me
You hear that?
Yeah, that's me
They so happy to see me
And that's you, ouch
Yes, that's you
Then me

Jeannie, mercenary amazingest
On everybody's most hated and favorites list
They curse  black made the list
I reverse inertia, learn the words that I'm saying and shit
Or you can raise your wrist and raise it and wager the risk of failing
You'll just gain a couple of permanent braces
Saying they should've been vertical
Saying let me murder you
I'm here for the community and numerals curfew 
I'm for the people quite like a kegal 
Exercise dumb but prostitutes regal 
I stay with a crown, I salute, you stay down
If you say the greatest now, straight out of Cape Town

See, that's me when I walk up in the place, yes
Double fist drinks doing a two step
And everybody knows don't fuck with me, come on

Man I'm hardly patient like minorities placed in
An ENR on the wait list, horribly blatant
Like I'm modern RnB I got seniority made
Lips spit game quicker, got no time I can play with
I'm a Rick James nigga give it to me don't say shit
Can truly be basement, red light
I might not make a move and be faithful
If you move with me graceful
Have you move in to Greyskull if you don't ruin the mood
And when we rude to get grave skull
If you don't catch it too 'cause I'm a feud and a faceful
You get canned up great updated like Facebook
Forget man's plans like hey look you stay shook as Ali
Michael J. Fox, Tone Wop and other infamous from mobs raps
Jean poppin' shit a lot, not
'Cause everytime you with the queen you dream of
Rocks being copped for the ring
Ring finger picture linger in your brain
Bring liquor with you if you wish to gain points
Not score, maybe I'll get my rocks off
And you can get lock jaw but Don no sleep I'm a rock star
Minus the coke, even if the finest still nope
I get my high on legally, frequently
Holy lines of dope require frequency
Don't you wish you could kiss her, up sticks your wood
When I kick a sixteen, no guy spits so good
Things you wanna ask me, hittin' on me backstage
Wishing that your speech had a backspace
Friends are like ""You mad gay son, you fucked up badly""
If I had the floor, I murder all the fucking bag Grae
I thought I told you that Miss Jeannie was the anti-Ghostface
Not music I don't fuck fans no place

What The Hell,Dust Ruffle: Songs I Found Under My Bed,UnKnown,"Nigga what?  What?
What the hell are y'all looking for?
Can't a black woman make money anymore?
What the hell are y'all looking for?
Can't a black girl write rhymes anymore?
C'mon, what the hell are y'all looking for?
Can't a black woman get money anymore?
Nah really
What the fuck are you looking at?
Seriously, stop it

Logically I should be ahead of the game
Pass spit flame rhymes, passed in fame time so I claim mine
Contain minors ready to bust, steadily cuss you
Like a T-Tourette's stutter motherfucker none of you want it
I'm pumping your stomach, I'm hungry I need it you waste it
I'm creeping so close that I can finally taste it
It's fire like bile an hour one mile
With the final destination God bless me, the child
And all the trials and tribulations compiled to make me
I'm still faceless but they all see
Number 3 on the wait list, flow is weightless
And my show is graced with an impeccable sense of hatred
Smile sinister rhyme regular never get it
I administer punishment like the bad lieutenant
I'm Flo Jo with a bad knee, I go slow
Except when guns blow I'm Joyner-Kersee
I know y'all enjoyin' the curse at first listen
Then change your positions by the start of verse 3
Give in, screw till it hurts but remove your distaste
Before I prove your waist jerks the other way from face first
Pray till God stops answerin' but you may not get off your knees
Till He himself puts a hand on 'em
I'm penning anthems this year, get up and stand for them
Up your grands and pennies I got plans for them
Do a handstand on your bandstand right in your show man
Kick a speaker left stage in the front row
Run slow even at gun smoke, my lungs toke
Enough shit to make a fireman think he gonna choke
Done woke yet? I shine like the sun but don't set
So bright, still not in my prime yet
Cut off your privates get blood on your eyelids
Red splash so high then it rains on you violent
Try and test you get divided with pliers I'm restless
I got you on a death wish check list
Like Uma Thurman I'm losin' hurt them
Insert your crew here jerk red dot murder them
I can't stop serving 'em, I am not certain
That you're real clear Jean is the sickest, you're learning 'em
Get your bars up like cali done said
I got mine, it's just over your head now

What the hell are you looking for?
Can't a black woman make money anymore?
C'mon, what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a black girl write rhymes anymore?  Shit!
What the fuck are y'all looking for?
Can't a black woman make money anymore nigga?
Nah seriously
Don't fucking look at me, I'll fucking smack you
Stop fucking looking at me
I'll fucking smack you right, right in the fucking face",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-what-the-hell-lyrics
SupaLuv (Acoustic Rehearsal),Dust Ruffle: Songs I Found Under My Bed,UnKnown,"I was a skeptic, hesitant, even when he said
I've heard that line before
It always carried some ill intent for sure
But then he said it some more
Pretend I've never been in love, I'm not getting sprung
But I could miss it, he could be the one
No one better than he could make me believe
I'm 'bout to call my family, be like ""I met him, mom""
""Wedding's on! Ready the party!"" but instead I'm calm
Surface though, all fireworks, wired up espresso
His expressiveness is impressive as ever, let's go
Chill in the tropics drinking rum punch, One Love
Singing it over lunch he got me love dunced out
My luck's been out, feel me?
It done run south, left me a ton of doubt
It's never fun gettin' the run-around
Wooed easy, I bruise easy
When dudes leave me I get boozed ugly, oh trust me
He's freaking speech though and I'm drinking Goldschlager
A teensy-more-than-moderate feeling you both scatter
Feeling your clothes 'cause you're appealing and you're really close
Thinking of stashing you up in my pockets, being ghost
Check it, I'm long-legged, we could wreck my dorm mattress
You could be my new partner, or my new fetish

Supa luv for me
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my supa luv?
I need a supa luv
I need a supa luv

Okay, this one's different now
Step to me dancing, hand in my back pants
And dancing to back tinting
Same line, way fine, he from the Cayman Islands
And my waistline he trace, fine enough flutter my eyelids I'm
Drinking Patron shots, so much the floor shakes
Loving every bit of him he's sputtering the rhythm and
Buttering Grae's ego with the clean-cut pimp-lean
With the clean glean, ""I tink I love he!""
Picture us loverly, playing games, he's hugging me
Stay engaged two weeks, eloping out the country
Not a spark of potential and um
Y'all, did I mention he's a tall drink of water?
Sink him into me mentally, intensely feeling him
Intentionally sipping Hennessy, let's leave the building
So we can build more, he's so hot
We can have a family because he told me he got

Supa Luv for Jean
Something that isn't the hook
You could be the one in all my dreams
Could you be my supa luv?
I need a supa luv
I need a supa luv
And also some god damn water

One, two, three, four

Supa Luv for Jean
Could you be the supa luv for me?
I'm looking for the one in all my dreams
Could you be my supa luv?
I need a supa luv
I need a supa luv

The girl in the front needs a supa luv
That guy needs a supa luv
(He needs a supa luv)
Everybody got a supa luv
People who are on the guest list got a supa luv
Even though I need a supa luv
You guys don't pay for the tickets cause you thought you were too special got a supa luv
(It doesn't have to be soup or love)
Why do I have to choose between soup or love?
What is that?  Soup or love?
Soup is kinda like love at the same time

You gotta climb
You gotta climb
Left foot on, right foot on
You gotta climb
One, two, three, four, five, six, uh, uh

On my first step taken I was shaky on the ground
But I left a footprint that was so deep
That when the second step came I got ready fame
'Cause everybody knew me as the heavy foot queen
Third step heard a rep that the girl stomp hard
God damn, Godzilla-like, you gotta feel her right
Shakin' your soul until the sixth done step in
I reckon it was all like wrecking balls
Door smashed in, hot floor starts cracking to four
At five, I was terrorizing neighborhoods
On the news live, fucking up your cable good
Every station I'm on makes Grae an icon
Buckle up the straps on my mary janes, I'm gone
(Two two two) To be exact
Mean the straps for the sixth step pavement crack
Before my foot was even laid I created a crater
So wide that the seventh step wavered, teetered
So I had to learn to levitate (Eight) big shiva
If earth can't hold up my weight then I'll leave her
(Nine) The first steppin' air debonair deity
Rapping air freely direct to the Pleiades
(Ten) I remembered all the men below: perverts
Suckers ain't amazing when they catch you with an upskirt
Grabbing my dress and evanescing to eleven
Birding on the twelve, I'm up in the heavens
Trepidation at the superstition of thirteen
Revelation in my mind said I could burst free
But first divorce the forced thoughts that stall cause
And I ain't stop counting",https://genius.com/Jean-grae-the-climb-lyrics
