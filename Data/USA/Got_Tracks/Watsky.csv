Pale Kid Raps Fast, Live! from the Troubadour,UnKnown,"O, hai! I'm that guy,
 built so fly in a silk bow tie
Don't know why I'm built so fly
But I am, no lie—oh my!
Rolled by on a lowride Huffy
Sitting on the pegs, shelltoes puffy
Cuff rolled up to my calf
Class out the ass,
 
bad with the swag like Buffy
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet
I'm a sinner, but I bet I could've been a better man
I wanna be Zen, but I go sippin' on some medicine
Instead of meditating, but I get it when I can
I don't wanna wind up in the gutter with a bottle of malt
Liquor, bitter 'cause I never got a call
Telling me that it's all figured out
I'm sick of doubt, but I'm looking at the wall
Part of me was hoping to be caught up in the moment
And be open to the good and the God in me
But I got a lobotomy
And I get that I oughta become a bit of an oddity
When somebody gets offended by the thought of me
""Who's he?"" …You gotta be kidding me!
Do me like Gabourey Sidibe
If you see me with a chickadee
No diggity, it'll be giggity giggity giggity
Gonna send it like a letter from above
With a woman that I love, 'cause I get it like I live
But if my baby's gay, I'll say: ""You go, gay baby
Work that crib! Work that bib!
 
Burp that kid!
Screw police! Flip that car!""
I don't want a Jesus piece
But I want a Reese's Piece and a Kit Kat Bar
I want everybody focusing on getting me to Letterman
To kick it for the betterment
Of innocent Americans who never want to settle
For their pop…
 
or not, 'cause my bedroom rocks
And the beat still knocks when I sort my socks
I'm five-foot-eleven of sex
From the tip of my head to my gorgeous... knees

Who is that boy? How does he rap so good?
I don't know how that pale boy raps so good
How does he do that? Do that?

Whoa Whoa Whoa,All You Can Do,2014.0,"Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?

I'm a phenomenon, and I gotta bring pain in The Octagon
When I wanna spit game at a soccer mom
I get it quicker than the left lane on the Autobahn, fast
Like Ramadan, had to battle young padawans all the damn day
I'm getting naked and I'm hopping on a wrecking ball
So hot, I got the motherfucker a la flambé
I go to Miley's house, I see that Miley's home
I play Miley's ribcage with my dick, like it's a Xylie-phone
Yes, that was highly fucked up but my skills are highly honed
And if I was highly hyphy, I might be more widely-known
C'est la vie, better pay my fee
They kick it in Seattle in a Patagonia jacket
They get it in the Bay in a plain white tee
Hey mami! You a P.Y.T
You wanna see me speak, then I go, go, go, go!
Cause, every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up
I bend it then I break it then I chop it then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way
I've been treating the music, I bleed it, I bruise it
I kick it to the curb and then I'm sipping on my bourbon
I be freaking it, doing it, keeping it moving
I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle
But I'm nice, nice!

Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?

I jump the freeway median, I'm savage
Cause my mode is that I'm meaner than the average
Like my teacher taught me when I heard the crowd applaud
I thought I was an atheist until I realized I'm a God
It could hurt a bit when I murder shit
In a moment, I'll be taking off a tourniquet
When I burn them and I hit them in the sternum
I don't even got to enter, but I'm gonna win the tournament
That's what I'm all about
I do what I got to do and never gonna pout
And I hope that it would have been the end of it and I'm out
But they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt
Ever since I was a little kid
I know that I've been looking for the hot, hot spotlight
And if you really wonder what I think about the competition
They were not-not-not tight
I've been reading my scripture
Every photo bomber wanna be in my picture
And you better bet I'm living every single day
Like it's the motherfucking Catalina Wine Mixer
Bada bing, bada boom!
When I walk in, I'm the king of the room
And I get it locked in like a king in a tomb
When I spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes
Cause I'm back in the nick of time and attacking the fickle mind
I'm a jackal, I'll rip his hide, I'ma tackle him, pick a fight
I be Dracula, set to bite in the black of the bitter night
And I'm out, poof

Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?
Whoa whoa whoa
What do you take us for?

What do you take us for?

What do you take us for?",https://genius.com/Watsky-whoa-whoa-whoa-lyrics
Sloppy Seconds,Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"Fuck you if you love a car for its paint job
Love you if you love a car for the road trips
Show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar
Where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips
'Cause you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard
Right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp
And when you woke up
Somebody was unclipping your seat belt
And pulling you from the open window of your flipped car

Cold pizza, tie-dye shirts
Broken hearts, give'm here, give'm here
Hand me downs, give me give me leftovers
Give me give me sloppy seconds
Give em here, give em here

I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you

Show me someone who says they got no baggage
I'll show you somebody whose got no story
Nothing gory means no glory, but baby please don't bore me
We won't know until we get there
The who, or the what, or the when where
My favorite sweater was a present that I got a couple presidents ago
And I promised that I would rock it till it's thread bare
Bet on it
Every single person gotta couple skeletons
So pretty soon, in this room
It'll just be me and you when we clear out all the elephants
Me and you and the elements
We all have our pitfalls
Beer's flat, the cabs have been called
And everybody and their momma can hear the drama that's happening behind these thin walls

Cold pizza
Tie-dye shirts (Tie-dye shirts)
Broken hearts
Give'm here, give'm here
Hand me downs (Hand me downs)
Leftovers (Leftovers)
Sloppy seconds
Give'm here, give'm here

I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you

I don't care (Cold pizza)
Where you've been (Tie-dye shirts)
How many (Broken hearts) miles, I still love you
I don't care (Hand me downs)
Where you've been (Leftovers)
How many (Sloppy seconds) miles, I still love you

My pattern with women isn't a flattering image
But I don't want to run away because I said so
I dont want to be the guy to hide all of my flaws
And I'll be giving you the side of me that I don't let show
Everything in fashion
That has ever happened
Always coming crashing down
Better let go
But in a couple years it will be retro
You rock Marc Ecko
My shirts have the gecko
'Cause in the past man, I was hopeless
But now's when my little cousins look the dopest
(Whoop whoop)
Fuck the fashion po-po
Have a stale doughnut, I don't need no tips
Fuck a five second rule
That's a plan I never understood
It's September in my kitchen in a Christmas sweater
Sipping cold coffee on the phone with damaged goods

And there is not a single place that I would rather be
I'm fucked up just like you are, and you're fucked up just like me

Cold pizza (Cold pizza)
Tie-dye shirts (Tie-dye shirts)
Broken hearts
Give'm here, give'm here
Hand me downs (Oh, hand me downs!)
Give me give me leftovers (Leftovers!)
Give me give me sloppy seconds
Give'm here, give'm here

I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you
I don't care where you've been
How many miles, I still love you

I don't care (Cold pizza)
Where you've been (Tie-dye shirts)
How many (Broken hearts) miles, I still love you

"Tiny Glowing Screens, Part 2",Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"There’s 7 billion 46 million people on the planet
And most of us have the audacity to think we matter
Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day
Hey, you hear the one about the fisherman who passed?
He didn’t jump off that ledge
He just stepped out into the air and pulled the ground up towards him really fast
Like he was pitching a line and went fishing for concrete
The earth is a drum and he’s hitting it on beat
The reason there’s smog in Los Angeles is ‘cause if we could see the stars
If we could see the context of the universe in which we exist
And we could see how small each one of us is
Against the vastness of what we don’t know
No one would ever audition for a McDonalds commercial again
And then where would we be?
No frozen dinners and no TV
And is that a world we want to text in?
Either someone just microwaved popcorn
Or I hear the sound of a thousand people pulling their heads out of their asses in rapid succession
The people are hunched over in Boston
They’re starting app stores and screen printing companies in San Francisco
They’re grinning in Los Angeles like they’ve got fishhooks in the corners of their mouth
But don’t paint me like the good guy ‘cause every time I write
I get to choose the angle that you view me and select the nicest light
You wouldn’t respect me if you heard the typewriter chatter tap tap
Tapping through my mind at night
The same stupid tape loop of old sitcom dialogue
And tattered memories of a girl I got to grind on in high school
Filed carefully on rice paper
My heart is a colored pencil
But my brain is an eraser
I don’t want a real girl, I want to trace her from a catalogue
Truth be told I’m unlikely to hold you down
Cause my soul is a crowded subway train
And people keep deciding to get on the next one that rolls through town
I’m joining a false movement in San Francisco
I’m frowning and hunched over in Boston
I’m smiling in Los Angeles like I’ve got fishhooks in the corners of my mouth
And I’m celebrating on weekends
Because there are 7 billion 47 million people on the planet
And I have the audacity to think I matter
I know it’s a lie but I prefer it to the alternative
Because I’ve got a tourniquet tied at my elbow / I’ve got
A blunt wrap filled with compliments and I’m burnin it
You say to go to sleep but I been bouncing off my bedroom walls since I was hecka small
We’re every age at once and tucked inside ourselves like Russian nesting dolls
My mother is an 8 year old girl
My grandson is a 74 year old retiree whose kidneys just failed
And that’s the glue between me and you
That’s the screws and nails
We live in a house made of each other
And if that sounds strange that’s because it is
Someone please freeze time so I can run around turning everyone’s pockets inside out
And remember...
You didn’t see shit",https://genius.com/Watsky-tiny-glowing-screens-part-2-lyrics
A Hundred Words You Could Say Instead of Swag,Nothing Like the First Time,2013.0,"Swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag, swag

I thought Swag was dead way before this
I thought Swag had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said Swag in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus
I thought Swag was dead way before this
I thought Swag had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said Swag in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus

You're a Boss hog, you're a top dog
You're so slamming, that I would say you've got pogs
You're suave, swell, sick
In the sense of being ill, chill, slick
You're hip, You're a hit, You're the tits, You're it
If I were being rude then I would say you're the SSHSHHHHS--
Shimmy shimmy cocopuffs, You're so loco
You're so dope it's nuts. you're raw as an open cut
You're bold, you're golden, You're Funner
A stone cold stunner, A real mean mugger
You're colder than the other side of my pillow
Or hot as the underside of the cover in a Los Angeles summer
You're not dumb and dumber, You're smart and smarter
You're hard and harder You're Peter Parker
Right after the spider bite You're so dynamite
Brightest light A hypest hype
You're so zen, you're a ten, you're gem
Creme de la creme de la creme de la creme

In 1860 Walt Whitman wrote ""I cock my hat as I please"" in his famous poem Leaves of Grass
In 2012 Justin Bieber said ""Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin by the fire while we eatin fondue
I don't know about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

I thought Swag had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said Swag in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus
I thought Swag was dead way before this
I thought Swag had been buried in the forest
But then Bieber said Swag in a chorus
And I went and bought a big fat thesaurus

Presence, essence, pizzazz, panache, dashing, flashy, brazen and brash
The verve, the nerve, the truth, the proof, the cash , the passion and class
Better than ever, cool as a cucumber, smoother than butter, a little bit smug
Hotter than a mug, eye of the Tiger, the heart of a lion, the look of thug;
Pick of the litter, the attitude, the cleanup hitter, the baddest dude;
Totally sure, full of allure, a raconteur, the poison and cure;
Gravitas, glamour, you're droppin' the hammer, a swashbuckling debonaire
A lister, with an X Factor, a capital G with the best hair
Dragon slayer, the franchise player, The king, the president, governor, mayor
You're rare, the opposite of square and pompous, You're shaped with flair like a rhombus
Confident, jaunty, awesomely saucy, You got more props than Ghandi
You got it on lock, rocks and moxie, you're rocking some brand new socksies
From city to city the grittiest kid, and he could be little bit cocky
But saying Swag is obnoxious
And if you be looking capture the confident way that I'm walking and talking there's options!
Just say he's got 'Watsky""",https://genius.com/Watsky-a-hundred-words-you-could-say-instead-of-swag-lyrics
Moral of the Story,Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"And the moral of the story is
And the moral of the story is
(Work!) till your arms fall off
Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft
(Just WORK!) till your hands go numb
And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb

I write till my fingers look like a bouquet of roses
You gotta bring yourself your flowers now in show biz
Focus it’s Quiet Coyote come on let’s go kids
Everybody get together with a study buddy
And then talk about the fucks that I don’t give
Because it’s so big and explosive
But a lotta people don’t live, they don’t ever get a motive
If you got a goal you gotta hold onto what hope is
If I didn’t have it I would ask you where the rope is
Work is my church and so the studio’s the closest
I spit it sick until my cootie flow’s the grossest
Don’t be so pissed just be focused on your own shit
‘Cause we Supercalifornialisticsexyandweknowsit
You’re not my menace, I go for number one, not a top five finish
You can have a chicken pot pie
But I’m thinking that I’m gonna have another can of Popeye’s spinach
I’m a Rottweiler, pop my collar when I pop my fur
You’re on my nerves, mark my words
Gotta put a leg up and then mark my turf

And the moral of the story is
And the moral of the story is
(Work!) till your arms fall off
Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft
(Just WORK!) till your hands go numb
And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb

Work until I’m black and yellow black and yellow, worker bee
I just work until I’m black and blue and burgundy
Burgundy, work until I earn that rich mahogany
Honestly, can’t you tell I’m working, bitch don’t bother me
Show some modesty, if you’re watching me
A bitch is anybody in my way it’s not misogyny
But if you're blockin’ me I will soon defeat you
I will build a bridge above you, or I’ll tunnel underneath you
I will eat you and excrete you and I’ll feed you to the flowers
If I need to I’ll go through you and absorb your fucking powers
I put in hour after hour let’s be crystal clear
I’m gonna get there if it takes a day or fifty years
I’ll fingerbang my fears, I’ll fucking punch a dragon
Even with the Himalayas in my way it’s gonna happen
‘Cause waiting doesn’t work, and praying may not come through
And hoping doesn’t work. So I will be the one to (work)

And the moral of the story is
And the moral of the story is
(Work!) till your arms fall off
Till your abs get hard and your bone’s all soft
(Just WORK!) till your hands go numb
And they cramp and the fans in the stands go dumb

Ninjas In Paris,Nothing Like the First Time,2012.0,"The first time I listened to Watsky
I was like, ""He sounds like a fucking honky""
And I don't even think he knows
But, then, I listened to him some more times
And, don't tell anybody about this
But, he kinda goes hard, though

I'm driving to the burbs and before I am coming back
I'm pulling in your driveway and I'm rolling front to back
I'm shifting forward then reverse my car a bunch
As if my Subaru's a wiener getting sexy with your cul-de-sac
L-O-L-O-L I'm from the avenue
A rapping labradoodle, half a wasp and half a jew
If you's a Saturday cartoon I'll smack ya black and blue
I'm acking ratchet with Daffy Duck and snacking on rabbit stew
Yabba Dabba Doo, I gotta lick my lips
Smoke a bowl with Yogi Bear, I'm sticking up your pic-a-nics
All of this is in my head, my 'maginations colorful
Crayons on the brain, I'll scribble silly shit all on my skull
Holy cow, I don't think they're gonna hold me down
I recommend you listen to the record in a theater with the Dolby sound
And I'm sipping on the coldest round
With the preppies and the Goldie Locks
But I bet a bunch of 100's everybody's gonna scatter any minute when the police knocks
Like ""Sorry ociffer, that getting sloshed occurred
But rastas broke in and they made us all smoke lots of herb""
I'm sorry, Honest Abe
Popo don't take me away way
Cause if you ever try to lock me up, I'm pleading cray cray
And then they'll all say may day
May day oh what did we do
He be creepy givin' me the heeby jeebies, he be Hebrew

Label to the life we're living and imagine a
Future where we won't be living in the past
I'll be flipping birds like a chicken breast on a spatula
So if you're bragging then you can forget it
And if it thunders and if it rains and pours, let it
And in the morning then it'll hit you that George said it
They gave him a fuck, he returned it for store credit
But don't be sore yet, if you got a score, settle it
Cause it's more pleasure with fun before etiquette
Get up on the table and pour your drinks, get it, but
Don't be boneheaded, it's for your own benefit
I'll be getting open and seeking my seventh heaven irreverent, while you be seeking a reverend or Pope Benedict

If I'm looking at tomorrow check my eyesight
All I'm gonna focus on is this fine night
Cause all I know is that this life is finite
Never Neverland isn't more than a legend and so I gotta be digging the present session and getting this
Wedging myself up into the wettest crevices, effortless
Grabbing a piece of the flesh, if you love it then why fight
Some people slower than a nineties modem
Wanna see the nips, it's a while to load 'em
If life is a woman she's got some epic titties and I wanna get up in it and live it and motorboat 'em
Cause I wanna see the cool and the classy
And I wanna see the cruel and the nasty
Cause if it's real shit, lemme feel it
And if you can't deal, I don't give a fuck

Exquisite Corpse,x INFINITY,2016.0,"Have you ever seen a corpse?
How about an exquisite one?
Think about Frankenstein’s monster
Now think about fun
You’re getting it, good!
Johnny starts with a leg. I sew on an arm. Then you lend a hand
We each add our piece
Now, what kind of beast have we made?
Let’s find out!

I woke up Sunday to a bloodshot sky
Robot overlords goose step by
Shoulda listened when we had the juice to try
And Bill the Science Guy told us that “the end is nigh!”
Lately it’s been getting harder to
Survive, since the Hive started to
Ban American refugees from being a damn part of the
People’s Republic of Antarctica
A bum begged me for a bill he could borrow
Babbling some shit about “there’s still a tomorrow”
He said that “legend has it, there’s still a Baja Grill and a Sbarro
At the top of Mount Kilimanjaro”
And so desperate, I set out from the deserts out in Portland
Until my thirsty horse collapsed in the scorched sand
I promised to myself heart and soul
I’d crawl across this dead world for those garlic rolls

Yo, kid, let go of the dead horse
Stop crying, need a ride? Hop in my red Porsche
Eat something homie, you look bony and frail
Now why the hell would you take the Oregon Trail?
Remember back in grade school, that stupid computer game?
You shoulda known better, now there’s no one but you to blame
Dying of dysentery
, 
don’t climb to the enemy
I’ma take you underground where the hive resistance be
Apparently a colony of people are out there
A garden full of veggies, even garlic they sprout there
Leader General Bieber who be running shit down there
Found a way to end the drought, bring out the swimwear
Soon as we pulled up we heard drilling noises
Children started dancing, even grown folk joined in
Like a hydrant in the Bronx, water shot up in the air
But was boiling and as hot as solar flares

Ooowee, ain’t that a bitch?
Nobody believed it 'til the first wave hit
The ground started shaking and the sky went red
(Mayday! Atlanta’s been lost, Justin Bieber is dead)
No! God damn, another one down
Colonies of people living under the ground
Rallied against the clowns, a resistance was born
They fight for mankind and the existence of porn (let’s go!)
Back on the surface life eaters
Avoiding wild packs of North American beavers
Creepers and face feeders
Fearing the great reaper
You’re either gonna get eaten or beat with a pay meter
This is real shit homie, dog eat dog
More like robot clown eats man and whole squad
Graffiti on the wall says “there is no god”
But there is still homemade vodka, and that’s cool

Homemade vodka, pour a shot up then I swill it
I’m the only person left who remembers how to distill it
It’s the most popular product in the underground economy
m
So I’m the most popular person in my underground colony
All the resistance leaders they throw shots down
In my bar after they fight the robot clowns
As of late they’ve been stressed and depressed
'Cause the chances of us winning are becoming less and less
We lost the captain of the human army
Morale's really low and a lot of people are starving
I’m still wondering how this all happened
Is this even real, or am I just on acid?
The clowns are advancing down
I use the word “down” cause they’re coming underground
Wait—what’s that sound? It’s kinda loud
Holy shit! There they are right now!

Calm down soldier, this is no time to be a fink
We can beat these clowns, okay, we just need to think
I’ve lost ten men this week, I can’t sleep a wink
But this the last place on earth a guy can get a decent drink
So darned if we lose this bar to these useless zombie bastards
I’d rather starve than be boozeless
So I put barbed wire slabs on the fences
That should buy us some time to plan our defenses
Pick up the chairs and trash cans off the floor
Stack 'em up on the front door to jam up the entrance
Ain’t got grenades, but we still might be saved
I just found fifty diet coke cans and some breath mints
Fill the trash cans to the brim with the cola
When the robots break in toss the mints in the soda
See the blast won’t hurt 'em but it’ll get 'em wet certainly
It’ll mess up their wiring and disrupt their circuitry
If it don’t work though, my next plan cannot fail
We drink the vodka—shot after shot 'til we’re too drunk to feel pain
Spark up a flame, and turn the bottles that remain into Molotov cocktails
I’ve had it with you clowns, I’ve reached my limit
You may have killed my captain, but I’m the lieutenant
And I won’t let you terrorize us, wait just a minute
That ain’t no robot zombie, man, what the hell is it?!

Adam! Ah! I didn't mean to scare ya'
Dude, that’s not a robot, it’s just Iggy Azalea
Musta hid up in the bar to learn about who we are
Then report back to the captain of the folks attackin' my favorite rap stars
Oh shit, quick! Hit her with some fuckin' duck-tape
She came to sing-rap & give us all some undercut fades
Lo-fi beats transmittin telegraphic autotune
Help! She’s inside my head, and I don’t think I am immune
Been repo-d, I think I’m in deep, I am weeping at the seams
Forfeiting my dreams of keepin' the streets G code
Only way to outrun it is doublin' up on the track
Any and everyone get up and meddle I mean it
Just puttin' the pedal into it
Now we taking over the tempo and tunin' it
Never gone let a lesser level ruin it, so I’m inducing it
Doomin it all, I’m undoin' it, deuces I'm dippin
Who comin' with the kid? I’m out
Head to the dojo, Diggs got pistols hidden in his fro though
These robots think we're bitch, Diggs, gimme some loko
And let me borrow your Jefferson robe
 
bro, I’m goin' postal
Bay boy's 'bout to put this barrel into some fuckin' blowholes

Whoa whoa whoa, hold up cash
You see I’m trimming my mustache up
I heard all these newly brainwashed rap chicks are really down to fuck
I comb the pistols out the fro and they’re sitting on the table
And there’s two cheesesteaks out in a fully gassed up LeSabre
I’m ready to ride on these haters, let’s go
But you better drive, 'cause you already know
That apocalypse or not when I’m behind the wheel
My black ass is sure enough gonna get stopped
And we ain’t got the time and the tags are expired
You know how it is, I am really not trying to die today, by cop, or by Iggy robot
Whoa, stop, lemme go bottle up this kombucha I’ve been brewing on the back porch
Grab the backpack out the closet, it’s got all of our passports
I’ve been planning this for a minute, seen the writing on the walls
If we survive and find a civilization, they’ve got to know who we are
First we swoop up Chinaka, in case we need some muscle
Or reason, or anything other than our indiscriminate hustle
Then we roll through the hood real slow bumping something all of these monsters know
Like a Watsky song? Lo and behold, they’ll follow our car wherever we go
Let’s lead em out to Napa and let em gentrify that bitch up
Start the car, homie, no, we are not stopping for any swishers
Or a McFlurry, bruh there’s no time for that shit
Hold up, there go Nak right there, pull over
Ayo Nak, Ayo Nak, get in the car!

Ay Rafa, get backseat
Make room for ya fam, friend
I’ll give you this McShake and the end of my Hansen
Now what the fuck y'all talking it’s the end of the world?
I been on Pinterest, tending to the end of my curls
I mean the sky is always purple, people running on vapors
I mean, the Tribune been gone, I ain’t gon read it in the papers
Nothing’s all that different, been the same for black women
When apocalyptic breakfasts follows revelation dinners
The lights been out, the water smelling of Flint
Exquisite corpses laying where the bodies had been
No bombs over Baghdad, just drones with grenades
So when life give us citrus, we learn to drop Lemonade
So, okay, fellas, shall we get in formation?
Bump some pied piper aura up out the trunk of this scraper
Do the end of the world styling in our fitteds and gators
Lure these stupid mufuckas on a goose chase
Use whatever’s already in our suitcase
I got this whole row jones for this open road
And my flow so cold, we don’t need AC
I popped fo’ no doze, I’ll read this formal prose
I bet you Butler knows how to make us free
A Lauren Olamina in a Trumped up world
A black magic woman still being called ""girl""
But the only constant is change, holmes
So let’s get the supplies and then dip up out our Bay homes
Got this earthquake kit and six gallons of gas
I got Diggs in the driver and Raf in the back
Got this passenger seat and the last of these sweets
Go north, Daveed, just gun it 'til wine country
Do it moving fluid like turfin' with iDummy
It’s the Bay moves we learned as natives gon' keep us safe
It’s that forty water water and an instrumental tape, let’s go
They’ll get tired behind us
I mean half of 'em hybrid but, nigga, most of them wind-ups
We got nothing but power we got nothing but time
I got Kwudi’s new beats and Music of My Mind
But nothing left in Napa, but the scent of the grapes
No palate-cleansing tapas for discriminate taste
Nothing left in Calistoga but one popped bubble
We got just two dudes and like one Nak, trouble
How the hell we s'posed to repopulate humanity
The two of y’all and me? That’s, like, actual insanity
Like ew, that's really gross, guys
It's like, not Diggs, and not Rafa
Not nobody else, just get back
Just doing it styling in wine country with nothing else

Red red wine, I don’t want to die!
I hum under my breath as I fight death in the quiet depths of the bunker
I was confounded when I came to after Dumbfoundead
Brought me to the battered base underground where we hunkered down for the summer
But then winter came and the flame that we tended to flickered to nothing
And the few of us living resorted to burning cadavers like tinder and lumber
We bickered bitterly and our wickedness hit a peak in our hunger
Sickened we hunted each other
Pickpocketed the weak and we plundered
A visitor from the surface stole a garlic roll from a Dave and Busters
And I butchered the buster in his sleep just to lick his fingers for butter
But it kind of gave me indigestion, I confess, and the pipes ruptured from my dung
Lungs punctured when Dumb stuck me with the sharpened end of a plunger
Now it’s me and Grieves in a shallow grave
Next to J. Biebs and Azalea’s pale humungous butt
That I rest my head upon for my perpetual slumber
We frail and wretched kvetch and wail
It’s curtains, my days are numbered
And I’m numb to the pain, yet one remaining certainty gives me comfort
I made a living yelling my opinions loudly
Thinking I might matter if I drew a crowd, see
Now, my lily cheek on Iggy’s chilly cheeks
I finally see that the future will be fine without me
Nothing is entitled to be mine
I’m a token of a broken time
And maybe there’s survivors on the surface in LeSabres working on
Tomorrow sipping red, red wine
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, wine",https://genius.com/Watsky-exquisite-corpse-lyrics
An Open Letter (Interlude),The Hamilton Mixtape,2016.0,"An open letter to the fat, arrogant, anti-charismatic
National embarrassment known as President John Adams
Shiiiiiit!

The man's irrational, he claims that I'm in league
With Britain in some vast international intrigue
Trick, please! You wouldn't know what I'm doin'
You're always goin' berserk, but you never show up to work
Give my regards to Abigail
Next time you write about my lack of moral compass
At least I do my job up in this rumpus! (OH!)
The line is behind me, I crossed it again
Ooh, the president lost it again
Aw, such a rough life, better run to your wife
""Yo, the boss is in Boston again""
Let me ask you a question: who sits...
At your desk when you're in Massachusetts?
They were calling you a dick back in '76
And you really haven't done anything new since
You're a nuisance with no sense, you would die of irrelevance
Go ahead, you aspire to my level, you aspire to malevolence
Say hi to the Jeffersons!
And the spies all around me, maybe they can confirm
I don't care if I kill my career with this letter
I'm confining you to one term
Sit down, John, you fat motherfucker!

Some people simply have it

If I did not believe I was at least tiny bit ridiculously filthy at it
Wrote a book to branch out
After tour let's have a singalong and camp out
'Cause I came here for a single reason
And that's for friendship
And for drinking 'til I can't count—now

If you're Beavis then we butt heads
If you're a butthead, or a fake friend

I'm in charge of a strange cult of dudes

Kicking the bucket is vital to life I know that's the price

Don't be—parasites

Ooh, hooray, that’s so sick! 

With a little bit of luck maybe one of those sticks

I’ll be feeling a hella of a lot of swell
And from the second that I step in I’ll be smelling like a big cheese
Everybody better be ready to get it get it
Cause I’m getting nekkid if you really want a strip tease
And the babies in their highchairs taking off their bibs
And their mommies all be ripping out their wig weaves
And the pretty people in the oil paintings on the wall
Are popping molly
 and they’re stripping off their fig leaves
Better burn your clothes
It’ll curl your toes
Kissing women and they turn to toads
I’m pimping Kermit’s hoes
And I’m sure that every girl is a pearl and the world is a perfect globe
But when I’m joking with my little cousin
And he pulls my finger then the motherfuckin’ earth explodes

Hop in my DeLorean

Hanging out the window like I’m Marty McFly

And all I hear is bawk bawk
And I’m not gonna wanna talk shop
Better put a sock in it if you gotta cock block
And be toxic and knock us and all we wanna do is rock rock and be raucous

Cause the sun is shining

And I don't know why
And I don't know why

I know I'm often told
That there's a pot of gold
But I don't see no fucking rainbow and my coffee's cold
I know I should be grateful
I know I'm good and able
But I don't have the strength to get up from the kitchen table
This kind of shot comes once
Another opportunity of a lifetime just slipped away
And that's the fifth this month
But when you take a punch
Don't you ever forget
Why you get up and you put one foot in front of the next

Got the power of my will
I don't wanna win a mil
But I'm looking at the window sill
Gotta take a bitter pill
Gonna pay for what I did to my head and my heart'll foot the bill
Got a foot in my mouth and because I'm kicking myself I developed a habit of knocking out my front tooth
Looking uncouth
Want to hear the truth
Give it to me straight
151 proof
Telling myself it'll happen when I'm happy but I'm climbing up a ladder that has got no end
Hung up on a rung I'll never make it to the top, I'm looking at the bottom and I must descend
All I want to do is buck this trend
Everybody need a buck to spend
And I'll be working on myself, til I work on someone else, til I get there Ima just pretend

In a moment of silence
I look under my eyelids
And I'm checking my mileage
I been using a pool of water as a mirror but not for style it's
So I can reach in and pimpslap my reflection for acting childish
Spent a half an hour
Sitting at the bottom of my shower
Letting the water run over my body and (dammit I wanted to get up) but I didn't have the power
I don't have the answer anyway yay (yay yay yay yay yay yay)
Don't want to panic but I got to come clean
Because the plan of the planet is just mean
Knew it was tough, but dammit it's obscene
I been huffing and puffing up to the top of the summit and I'mma rough it if I have enough steam
I'll keep on coming and coming until I'm coming with the stamina of a salmon who's heading upstream

Fuck the soda, re-run it with just the cheesy fries
‘Cause I don’t think money is THE devil
I’m not sinking, I’m just kicking it at sea level

I’m focusing on all the wonderful stuff with the force of Obi Wan
Kenobi bro, I’m broke although I won’t be woebegone
‘Cause even though my bank account is low or overdrawn
I’m down to mow yer lawn
I’m getting open I’m soaking up every moment
And so we should make a toast we won’t be sober till the BROKE of dawn
Because beer is cheap
And because love is free

With lesser possessions I’m light as a feather and so I can fly like an eagle
‘Cause everyone dies and I wonder why leaders in power would lie to their people
Be planning like they could be fitting a camel up into the eye of a needle
But dammit I’d settle for fitting a 94 Camry inside of my driveway
I’m sick of the image I’m living my life and I’m doing it my way
I’d rather be making the choices I’m proud of than chasing a mountain of money
But if that mountain comes to me, I’m climbing it
Got a brick and I’m laying it down
Got a shovel, I’m breaking this ground
Because I’m in the red, but it’s only a color that I will be painting this town
Because when I make it then I dedicate it to the friends I stayed with
Who would do me favors even lend me paper when I couldn’t pay for a little takeout
And to the fact
That whatever you think that it means
I be here and I’m living my dreams
And it’s ‘cause of the people I leaned on when I came apart at the seams
So gimme the moon
And gimme the spoon
I’m licking it clean
Until there just ain’t nothing left
But who would lend a hand ‘cause…

Talking to Myself,x INFINITY,2016.0,"One day you opened up your eyes inside of you
Inside a world inside a universe you didn't get to choose
You didn't get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace
Or cast the cast and crew
You didn't get to pick your starting place
And though it was a race you didn't understand
You simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran
And when you tripped and dropped, you picked yourself up off the ground
And picked your scabs and knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began
As you got older there were days of cold surrender
Days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor
But as time advanced, the lovely days were covered up from view
By an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew
Yet there were moments
There were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head
Outside your pain, outside control, outside the bullshit, out of body, out of rage
Outside the need to get it, get it? You will never get it
That's okay

Have you felt a little off today
Had a lot to say
But wound up talking to yourself?
I've been hunting for a kindly ear
But couldn't find one near
And wound up talking to myself

Had a little spot—where you been going through a lot
Wanna shove it to the bottom—but a trouble gonna bubble to the top
Then the bubble gonna pop—and the hustle never ever gonna stop
'Cause you get up in the morning get ahead, get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop
You need a plot—what you wanna witness with this life you got?
You kicked and fought tryna get up in your skin and pick this lock
That ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu
Issues someone fit to quick should sit you down to talk
Ever wonder who's the crazy the one—people walking to work as if nothing is off
But if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebody's head and looting from shops
Are there times you're alone knowin' nobody's home, but you walk around mutterin' under your breath second guessing shit saying, ""Goddammit, goddammit, goddammit,"" just whispering soft
Do you ever get lost, deep in your thoughts, tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through?
When you tie your stomach into knots that you don't know how to undo
But do you ever have another moment after that, when you can see
There's no one way this has to be? Or maybe that's just me

Have you felt a little off today
Had a lot to say
But wound up talking to yourself?
I've been hunting for a kindly ear
But couldn't find one near
And wound up talking to myself

Because if we don’t build it, who will?
I do things on a shoestring that you couldn’t do for a cool mil
I run with no laces, and when I fall, I start
To build my Taj Mahal with shit I found at Dollar Mart
This life’s our greatest project
The journey’s all an art
But I built my perfect nest and it’s ‘bout to fall apart
Again and again and then I just I make it twice as high
And I give my tower teeth, and I watch it bite the sky
Because I might just cry if I don’t keep it moving
I focus on what I can make and not what just got ruined
‘Cause every stone will crumble down to dust, to dust, to dust
And I say love thy neighbor, and I say fuck thy hater

Cause my imagination is crazy as Glenn Beck
A cloud is floating by in the shape of a rent check
And when the world ends, that’s what I’ll plan towards
Then I’ll trust girlfriends and maybe landlords
Cause I been played but I’m looking for more
I say, ""What would I gain if I took it to court?""
‘Cause if people were perfect then there wouldn’t be war
We stay pushing but once we get a foot in the door
We get our toes chopped off and a foot of manure
I still gotta believe people
Are good at the core
‘Cause if we weren’t, what’s at stake?
Why would we stay to break what we make
And create all these beautiful mistakes
When they blow our house down let’s draw on the walls, the walls, the walls

Holy, holy, holy, holy (Holy shit, holy shit), you mean to tell me, tell me, tell-
You're tough to love when you don't love yourself? Well

Welcome to the family

Welcome to the family

My less exciting features are packed inside my body
They're crammed into the balcony, they're jamming up the lobby
They're falling out the window
You can see them crashing through the glass
When I don't keep my lids closed as the director flicks his wrist
The stagehand in the wing has got a silver chain he grips it
When he lifts it opens up the velvet curtains of my lips
And I say

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

We're not looking to wish on a star (Star)
We're no good at receiving the help (Help)
Who the hell do you think that you are? (Are?)
Tryna make me believe in myself
You're like the sun in the summertime
I know you are, but what am I?
I don't really wanna sound like a lullaby
But I think every family is a butterfly
You know, pretty from afar, pretty gross up close
Don't pity what we are, it's mostly unhideous
And I'm sitting at the bar with a beer
So cheers, come toast me
Get cozy since we're both lonely
Why don't we leap and then go see
What we become when it's done, it's done
But I'm not looking below, so don't ghost me
And it's seeming like we're in agreement
That the demon that we're fighting isn't the exact same
But if we're teaming up and carrying the weight together
We can miss a bit of back pain
And if you're into it then we can get up out the city
In a minute in the fast lane
Get hitched in a chapel in Vegas
Maybe get rich, life is a craps game
And I take my cue, from you
On what you wanna do 'bout a last name
It's not so bad to be a Watsky

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

Those fires in your attic that rage without permission
Some days invade your living room or break out in the kitchen
They breeze right through the building
They just show up as they please
And then retreat like grown up children
Well how'd you like to split this L and
Tell me what you've witnessed
If the price of life is hell
Well no one ever had to sell me on how nice a fire smells

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

And there's so much I've been silent on
But I'll whisper every secret to you when this mic is gone
And I know you'll listen (Listen)
And I know it's different (Different)
But it gives me peace our missing pieces could be siblings
The rough nights ain't leaving, so why the hell should we?
And I say

Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family
Welcome to the family

You deserve love (
Welcome to the family
)
You deserve love (
Welcome to the family
)
You deserve love (
Welcome to the family
)
You deserve love (
Wel- wel- wel- wel-

You deserve love (
Welcome to the family

You deserve love (
Welcome to the family

You deserve love (

We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens

I’ve seen a person go to shows and raise a lighter app
But if you’re at my concert please don’t ever try that crap
Let’s set fire to the heavens
Turn the motherfucking speakers to 11, this is Spinal Tap
The future might defeat me, the internet can eat me
It really tastes like chicken when I bite the hand that feeds me
And I say me me, me me, play my CD, CD
Yes indeedy deedy
We be greedy and it’s tragic that we yawn
We got every gadget but don’t care there’s magic in our palm
‘Cause it’s been getting so hot, I can feel the slow rot
But let’s not die before we get to fuck a robot
Because we all need something to live for, something to live for, something to live for
We all need something to live for, something to live for

And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens, glowing screens
And when the sun burns out
We’ll light the world with tiny glowing screens
Tiny glowing screens

There was a time before the pot really got strong
Before the hippies got jobs talking long, long
Before the people talked in English out in Hong Kong
Before the holy Dalai Lama had a dot com
Before God’s dad got it on with God’s mom
Before he made us pretty things on which to drop bombs
Before the war crimes
The rich and poor times
I’m talking in the land before 
The Land Before Time
But then the planet lost its baby fat and got crazy
And we’ve been acting like some fraidycats a lot lately
Something’ll kill us like cigarettes or the commies maybe
Or maybe AIDS or scabies, rabies or zombie babies
Even the KGB, pray we be free from ADD, wade in and bathe in Hades
No army or Navy’s saving me
And I can’t tell our little victories from epic fails
It’s either heaven or hell and I can’t make heads or tails

Are we useless?
No excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
Are we useless?
No excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces
So raise your peace sign, if you’re not useless
Raise your peace sign, no excuses
We took the peace sign, reduced it to deuces

Letter to My 16-Year-Old Self,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Sup, bitch!
Na, I'm just messin' with ya
What I meant to say was, ""Never give up!
Always be yourself.""
It's gonna suck hearing that over and over as you get older
But as stereotypes start with a grain of truth
Cliches begin with a boulder
And no matter what you're an animal, a born natural
So you don't need some motivational speaker asshole
Feeding you reheated inspirational corn casserole
You magical bastard!
Get it through your brain, inject it in your vein
Get infected with the strain
The strange idea you're a reflection of the greats who came before
More than science
Our body's our history's oldest appliance
We're piggyback riding the shoulders of giants
Which is how we survive when the ceilings keep getting higher
And the light bulbs keep burning out
We learn by word of mouth
And when your time has passed, don't drag each other down
Cause being a crab in a bucket is mad lonely
Be the crab escaping from crab prison
Who creates a crab rope out the window made only of crab homies
Cause we're in this together
Future you is just past you with new molecules
We shoot the old ones out follicles
And hair is dead cells, so our faults get shed well
Meaning our parts that are hard to adore
Get mopped up on the barber shop floor
In other words
Although you often don't remember people's names
Or are at the center of attention at all the wrong times
And spend, roughly, six hours a night on your side
Watching Boy Meets World reruns
You are capable of outgrowing that bullshit
I'm aware there is doubt
I don't believe in hell, but I believe in my parents' couch
You're gonna get depressed sometimes
You're gonna have weeks where you don't feel like eating
Where gravity is working overtime like it's afraid of getting laid off
And you can barely lift your fork to your mouth
And you are going to have a choice
Do you wanna see this world as ugly, or beautiful?
Wanna know what I think?
Well go fuck yourself! This is my poem
And I think the universe is great
It's like God just chucked a bunch of candy into space
And Earth is a jawbreaker
So it doesn't matter if you've got the biggest mouth
You can't just chew the world up and spit it out
You've gotta savor it
From the grandest to the blandest nook and cranny
Every crooked alley, every mountain, brook, and valley
From Candyland to Cali
That's been stamped by Rand McNally
Ordinary is outstanding!
So don't be impressed by mere miracles
And FYI, looking like a crusty hippy doesn't make you spiritual
You're gonna have to climb through a thorny mess of
Contradictions, underground rivers, and sometimes
What you love the most will cause your biggest problem
Because you know what's awesome?
World peace
And you know what else is awesome?
Catapults
And that's just the goddamn truth
This world is so confusing
But you're gonna be fine
You're gonna be fine",https://genius.com/Watsky-letter-to-my-16-year-old-self-annotated
Going Down,x INFINITY,2016.0,"I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
On you

I’m breathing deep then I leap in
I’m going under
Like eating that V’s the key to how we can beat global hunger
Achieve total peace on earth
I’m a freak, I’m a local wonder
More lung capacity than Freddie Mercury vocal numbers
I plunder the briny deep
A spelunker plunging in, hunkering down in between those puffy pink walls
Like a fallout bunker
And if I never emerge to the surface don’t gimme shit
In twenty years I’m back like Kimmy Schmidt (wassup)
Hold up, wait (Hold up, wait)
Cause I really gotta set one thing straight
I’m not chowing on the chocha so that you’ll reciprocate
I just go in (go in)
No strings (no strings)
Tastes great (tastes great)
Fun times (vitamins!)
I got a wand tongue
I’m doing sorcery
If you don’t want none
Well that’s just more for me

I’m going down
I’m going down
On you

I’m going down on you like I like it but bruh I’m lyin’
Cause I don’t like it, I love it that shit’s my valentine
One tiny warning—I’m dining on your gourmet form until the morning
Performing like it’ll stop global warming
My palate has got no equal
Talent could vanquish evil
And maybe make Rick Moranis be in the Ghostbusters sequel
One taste and I’m wailing “god bless!” (god bless!)
Until you quiver I will not rest (not rest)
Licking repeatedly like your beaver’s a square reader
And my tongue is a VISA debit card that failed to process
It’s like the Miracle Worker and I’m blind and I’m deaf and dumb
Plus each inch of my body’s numb except for the tip of my tongue
And each Wikipedia topic’s printed in microscopic raised ink on your clit
So the single option I got to know something about this wonderful globe that
We come from so locate your swollen bean and then probe the folds of it
Fiendishly til you cum about infinity times
And baby that isn’t a crime

I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
On you

Given our planet’s gender ratio
It’d be a mockery glossing over fellatio (there he go)
Meaning that really fucking quick
I gotta touch on sucking dick
Many guys visualize giving BJs and say “eww”
But can we just please give smoking pole a calm objective view?
I’m pretty straight, but I’ll state: sexuality’s an arc
Maybe I can suck a flashlight so my soul will not be dark
Why couldn’t I get sexual with a man at all?
At thirteen I was in my bedroom fucking stuffed animals
If I can bang an inanimate object can’t I jam the crotch of a man in my jaw and softly massage it?
Fellas vomit like “what if the sausage is smelling hella funky?”
Don’t you wash your fucking junk, B?
Of course I wouldn’t devour icky salami
But that goes the same for encountering stinky punani
So in this scenario where I brush my teeth with a penis
Let’s assume that the penis we’re dealing with sparkles the cleanest of all
Penis penis on the wall
With those well proportioned balls

I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
I’m going down
Down, down, down
I’m going down

So let’s say you’re okay with your lips around a cock
But you still can’t wrap your mind around the final moneyshot
Don’t give up! If the nut is what truly makes it foul
Then just get him close to busting and hand him a paper towel
Yup! No gravy on your chin!
Yup! Everybody wins!
Yup! Squirrel to an acorn
Dudes like to look at dicks in their straight porn
Put your hands up if you got hangups
Put your hands up if you got hangups
If I could get with it I’d have a wider ocean I’m fishing in
But I’m inhibited by my social conditioning
So where my head’s at present the odds are gloomy
That I would agree to feast on a D that’s presented to me
But I’m not officially ruling out
That at some point in my life I’ll have a dingaling in my mouth",https://genius.com/Watsky-going-down-lyrics
"Tiny Glowing Screens, Part 3",x INFINITY,2016.0,"Nothing matters, so it doesn't matter if nothing matters
And while you be, be true
And if you won't, fuck you
Burn your clothes
Open the wine
Close your eyes
Freeze time

You’re officially welcome to grab your crotches
Synchronize your watches and pour us a couple scotches
People still as statues can’t catch you, turn pockets empty
If they’re packed with plenty move some to ones lacking any
While I take a crack at hacking the bank to jack em to cover high debts
You’re screening floating bullets with a butterfly net, if there’s any screaming
Pause it and cut out the sound, deposit the slugs underground
I’m positive that we don’t fuck around
No we go scooping up the diesel that’s leaking a sinking tanker
Forever stuck at anchor like beetles get stuck in amber
Halted like the thaw of the iceberg that shoulda sank her
Halted right beside the temperature spike and the spread of cancer
And all my peoples’ engagements and babies my friends are making
We quit getting lamer, days quit getting later, life quits being labor, quick—
You should come through to our party, dude bring your crew bring an army
Youth is inside of the heart, the future can never harm me
We’re never tardy (freeze, freeze, freeze)
Late or early don’t worry we’ll wait cause we’re in no hurry to see those pearly gates
I sit outside and watch the pigeon shit and tiny airplanes hanging in the sky and then I
Hit a McCartney show and trip off how his arm is superglued to his guitar
 and then I
Enjoy the lovely view and stand there for a month or two,
 my 
headphones looping Love Me Do on repeat
Paul might not die if we try to wall off this diorama,
 we’ll buy all the time we want and then spend it all to
Move this crowd—to join as converts to the church of blessed concerts and then conjure up some conversation
Yes, I’m proud—my country is my heart and so in every combination we all rep a common nation
That is how—I know that all we lepers and we shepherds join together now in holy congregation, everybody
Stop right now!

I want to hear the church bells ring
I want to see the fog roll in
I don’t mind the muddy water
I don’t mind the ocean wind
Show me I’m alive right now
Even if you gotta prick this skin
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes

Some days I throw my hands up like this shit right here is hopeless
But today I throw my hands up like this shit right here’s the dopest
I’ll never sew my family’s holes up saying hocus pocus
So I focus love on what is whole and chase my magnum opus
There’s so much more to life before I leave this skin behind me
Right now I’m feeling finer than Aaliyah in the 90s
Yeah, today I’m feeling firmly like my faith could never burn me
Like I’m apt to move that mountain just by glaring at it sternly
San Francisco used to seem bigger than Jupiter
From the view of an atom the human body's a universe
How impossibly big it be,  this symmetry
This brutality, and beauty and synergy
And beyond what we'll live to see,  I know nothing can limit me
Just take everything ever and we are that times INFINITY",https://genius.com/Watsky-tiny-glowing-screens-part-3-lyrics
Stick to Your Guns,x INFINITY,2016.0,"I’ll be gone when you read this so I just wanted to say
I’m sorry to the couple decent people who got in the way
And maybe there was a point at which this all could have been different
But this is the position we’re in and it’s pointless to wish that it isn’t
They'll all be gawking when I walk in the door
Cocking my shotgun hammer and they drop to the floor
The clocks shatter I scatter the jock horde and splatter the chalkboard
It matters a lot more, than half of you thought
When you were knocking me like I’m a laughingstock
And a weakling a freak and creep, I was mocked and ignored
You’re sorry now but talk is cheap-- shoulda thought it before
You’re the sorry flock of sheep who made me rot to the core
And of course you’ll make a break to escape through the corridor
Don’t be late— I’ll set you up on a date with the coroner
And our fate’s are sealed, all of you fakes
Don't worry, this will all be over soon
[Chorus: Watsky +

You got your finger on the trigger, kid
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
You got your finger on the trigger, kid
Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth

Thanks for tuning into the top-rated crew in the news
Feels great to us that we’re the one that viewers would choose
I’m hearing through my producer
We’ve got the scoop on the name and the favorite food of the shooter
Plus an interview with a student
Who’s been fed through a tube— she was shot in the head
We’re gonna bring you a segment live from her hospital bed
We’ll try to bring you the spin through your preexisting opinions
But if we miss it switch it to our sister network instead
Of course we know this situation is tragic
But take a minute to appreciate our fabulous graphics
And we’ll be back in action with up to the second reports
After a couple of words from all our loyal sponsors of course
So like us, vine us, and tweet to connect
24/7 we’re giving ya what you’re craving
We live to deliver live the kinda coverage that you’ve come to expect
We’re always here for you

Line it up, line it up, line it up
And hit me with the truth

Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns

We come together in this hour of need
To honor the innocent victims of this cowardly deed
Of course I share your sentiment as your voice in the Senate
But let’s accept nothing ever could have been done to prevent it
It’s just the strange inner visions of a deranged individual
Full of rage, full of hate, full of vitriol
I gotta mention that it’s sick and insane
My opponent’s twisting your pain for political gain
That’s lame
And I think it’s a damn shame
It doesn’t give anyone power to cast blame
Because the past is the past, and it’s best that we keep things the same
So my Chads and my Staceys, go back to the mall
Fill your bags out at Macy’s and chat in the hall
And I hope I’m that vote that you cast in the fall
'Cause I care for you, it’s true

Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns
Stick to your guns

You got your finger on the trigger, kid",https://genius.com/Watsky-stick-to-your-guns-lyrics
Never Let it Die,All You Can Do,2014.0,"I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

Cause it isn't the fashion, the cash, and isn't the trashing hotels
It's the pit of the passion you feel
, in the moment you crashed and you fell
Then get up and you're smashing it well, like it was a pistachio shell
And you gotta be gnashing your teeth, and be giving em hell
Cause to love is a radical act, give your brother a pat on the back
And if you get a panic attack, feel like you're at the back of the pack
An opinion's exactly that. If they say that your magic is black
Just do what you do when you do what you do, keep on pulling that rabbit from hat
You might think that you're ruined. You might think you're defeated
If you love what you're doing you've already succeeded
But there's gonna be bleeding, when another one bites that dust
So get ready to beat it, cause it might be us, and I'm telling em
That the journey is oh so slow and we wanna say “no no no”
Cause to make it is difficult, but we go go go
And my father was telling me that I better be ready ride on through
Cause I know that it's tough, but it's gotta be somebody, so then why not you?

I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

Carry the spark as we're marching into the darkness
I don't care if they're marking where they bury my carcass
I'm working in this circus and searching for purpose
Learning from the bird who's perched on top of the church and chirpin a sermon
You want that early worm? Be the determined sparrow
Flying in loops around the sternest scarecrow
Once cupid hit me with his burning arrow
He lit the lava in my churning marrow
So when I'm tested I remember I've been blessed
With that tender ember resting left of center in my chest
And yes, if you fuck with us you'll see my game face
Cause no matter who you pray to when you say grace
And no matter where you come from in this great space
Every single person is escaping from the same place
So if you got a flame that's blazing hot within
Take a deep breath and feed it oxygen

I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

…So I was really interested and loved folk music, and then when I was in seventh grade, in the fall of 1963, I started getting interested in politics.
 
This was about a year after my dad died, and I think it was a real way to connect with him… with my memories of him…

I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die
I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die, I’ll never let it die

Tore the pages from their Torahs,
 
hurled torches at their doors
So they departed Polish ports and boarded boats to court the green lady with that copper torch who rose up gorgeous off the shore
Endured that stormy weather for me
Ellis Island, hellish journey
Maggots in the hard barley
Some shot off their own toes so they couldn't be forced to march in the Tsar's army
Bodies pitched in ditches, singed and bludgeoned
Burned the children in the ovens by the dozens
Burned the witches in New England by the coven
They burn the different ones, so clutch your cousins close
Cause such is life, it's cuts and strife, and stitches, punches, knives and hungry crows
Nothing guarantees survival
And we won’t stop this terror sticking flowers in the barrels of their rifles
We fight the hatred with the light
And when they think we'll fold and wave that bright rag
We won't surrender
We'll wipe the blood up with the white flag",https://genius.com/Watsky-never-let-it-die-lyrics
Wounded Healer,Nothing Like the First Time,2012.0,"His footprints are fading away from the beach
We're not a family to pray or to preach
But daddy's best friend took a handful of pills and now he's at a podium making a speech
Yesterday night after dark
He carefully wrote his remarks
But everyone said what he put on his page so he threw it way and went straight from the heart

I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay

A year's a bottle in a bucket of trash
It'll tip over the more that it stacks
Didn't notice it till now but dad's been moving slower every time we go play catch
I'm scared of the day when he'll carry a cane
I carry his dream
I carry his name
And when papa is gone he will never be gone because the sound of our sneeze is the same
God bless I
Hear your voice
In mine
I want to stop time
Like a carnival ride
Because
I don't know what I'm saying but I mean it (repeat)

I thought this was a party
But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play
You wrecked me when you stepped out
Cause you're the wounded healer
And you're supposed to stay

But all my friends are leaving
And I still want to play

Suspended the same month I won the city science fair
I won most likely to succeed and teachers nightmare
Guess I was quite scary, some hate a binary
Sent to the principals office straight from the libary
But since my voice was about as high as Mariah Carey
When I had the douchey spiky hair like Guy Fieri
My flavor was a mystery you never knew what you were getting it could be some mild or some Wild Cherry
Just read my diary, cause I'm wirey
But I'm
 
irie
, and I spit it firey, hire me
I wouldn't hurt a fly
Though sensitive you never heard me cry
But I got a certified dirty mind
So grab some turpentine, a dash of listerene
And splash my mouth out with a gallon jug of Mister Clean
I'm flashing on every asshole up in the classroom
I'm planning on coming sick I hope you had your antihistamines
Before I split the scene, and we can puff pass
Cause I'm an honor roll kid who liked to cut class
A babyface but I tend to shave with a cutlass
And If you switch the picture to HD you'll see my mustache
I tend to slow it down when they want just fast
I'm a vegetarian who thinks that PETA sucks ass
I bring the ruckus, while shmucks be kissing my tuchus, I bookishly bust it nasty, you should be rocking a dust mask
I like smoking dope, but won't pop a pill
I think Oprah's ill, but I loathe Dr. Phil
I got the propers to a topple your whole metropolis stomp an impossible obstacle I won't be stoppin' to chill
From Chapel Hill to the big apple I travel the map
 
just trampling bastards but then I handle their hospital bill
If there's bees in the trap I'm catching em
By the thorax and abdomen
And sanding the stingers down to a rough quill
Then I dip em in ink, and I scribble a bit
But if it they wriggle then I tickle em until they hold still
Lemme say it again
In my land of pretend
I use bees as a motherfuckin' pen
But a lot of the guys I know
Have been saying that I'm so so
They're not a believer
That I'm a keeper
B-b-But I don't know
Maybe it's cause I be looking like Leave it to Beaver they're thinking that I don't flow
Even if I could be running in circles around em as if I'm gyroscope
I'll enter the draft and I'm thinking I might go pro
Running the jungle like I'm an albino rhino
Deep in the undergrowth
Fuck a disaster, bring on the asteroids
Never gonna be massacred like all of the dinos though
Bring on primal vinyl magic show
I'm turning a blind eye to the bull crap, waving bye bye
Zippity doo dah
Suck on my booty
Done with the bad luck
Put on my brass knucks
And I cold cock any Pol Pot in the whole spot, with that boom
I'm 
Fiddler on the Roof
 
hitting Hitler in his fruits of the loom
I'm Jew, on the right side but it's true
I'm a Christian on the left
Side of my family crest, dude
I've been to public school and private, been unpopular and popular and I don't think people pop from a test tube

Difference is the differences
Difference is the differences
Yeah, the difference is the differences I've got
Difference is the differences

Veneficia!
Seven trumpets!
Veneficia!

Easy, with a ballot, we can put a reality TV personality in DC
Speak free if you can see how this delicate fucking matter developed but, man, it beats me! (Oh my Gooood!)
Two fleets keep peace on the mean streets
One treats brown people like they’re beastly
Nothing like the force that police me (That’s so oooodd!)
What’s the fate of the species?
Get a metal plate and then mate with the PCs
Or retreat back to a monkey chucking feces?
(What’s the deeeeal?) Wanna ease this pain
Different than the BC years
Now we BCC Jesus on the email chain
Way too many threats to flee
Way too many heads to feed
Not too many beds to sleep
Chief said that it was best you leave
""F you, please"" to the refugees
And it’s seeming like it’s every other day that I been tugging at my collar, thinking, “Damn, it’s toasty!”
Where did all the people at the supermarket go
That used to scan my groceries? Vanished mostly
And wassup with all the homies with the camo and the ammo in the rifles on their shoulder
Walking through the city, thinking that they’re Annie Oakley?
That’s quite enough
But this shit is fucking unbelievable
I swear you couldn’t write this stuff

Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
Another fantasy is brought to life
Everywhere that I stare (Science Fiction!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
And now I never get surprised

Young George Jetson stepping up in this motherfucker
Gripping a butcher knife, hoping I can cut the chord
Where the horde is plugged to the motherboard
That is not a legitimate hoverboard (Shit’s got wheels!)
I Iook at the sky, saying “My God, run!”
Life’s heavier than an iPod one
My Twitter ain’t gonna matter when the tripods come
(Let’s get real!) From the hieroglyphs to the crowded malls
Never mind the if, but the how it falls
I’m vibing out watching Ow! My Balls (Oh yeaaaah)
Core defects tend to wreck my sleep
The quest to be more perfect than Ford Prefect
While I’m dreaming of Electric Sheep
‘Cause Soylent Green is people, resistance is just futile
Pop a red pill and a blue pill and I dilate my pupils
Moving light speed, we all got vile needs
Living is a violent deed
Spread my soul like Wild Seed
Why would it be any wonder I act weird?
I’m trying to find out who the fuck I am
While looking in a cracked Black Mirror
You got a finish what you thought about?
How this is gotta bottom out?
You wanna flee the reaper, but they’re bombing the city
And the single haven to creep in is the slaughterhouse

Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
Another fantasy is brought to life
Everywhere that I stare (Seven trumpets!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
And now I never get surprised
Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)
Another fantasy is brought to life
Everywhere that I stare (Veneficia!)
You couldn’t write this shit, no
Every minute, deeper in it (Veneficia!)

I’m at the park playing dodgeball
Drinking San Pellegrino like it’s Cristal
No school, alcohol
Living no rules, Calvinball
You wanna brawl? Ho please
I sprinkle you with some goat cheese
I get it straight from the fuckin’ farm
I even put goat cheese in my Lucky Charms
I’m at the taco truck looking like a mack
I roll my Rs hard like I’m busting off a gat
It’s like, “hola mama, I’m your papa”
May I please have dos Horrrrrrrrrchatas?
I’m like ""brap-brap-brap!""

Bullet to your disrespect, I hate your hipster attitude
Your whole chassez, acting like you own us with your whole passé
Dance around the issue patna, no plié
But you’ll get broke for that French shit, so cassé
And you can put that in your lit mag and your Tumblr blog
Eat it with the bacon off your farm fresh hog
Sip it like Kombucha, hope your last meal suit ya
Do-gooder types, commuters on bikes
Brooding 20-somethings with the coolest of “likes”
You be loving on my city like johns(johns)
Rubbing on her titties leaving money in palms
Our rumbling guts can only hunger so much
Plus we redundantly blunted in lieu of giving a fuck

Look in the mirror and it’s clear I’ve become one of ‘em
Kill me please if I’m one of ‘em
I walk the block like I’m hot shit
I gentrified the corner store just buying hot chips
But now I’m caught red-handed
With this land so make me a dead bandit
And if you see me sipping at an open keg
Put me down like a horse with a broken leg

Fireworks,Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"It’s hard to be living
You gotta play the cards you were given
You think it’s simple but it goddamn isn’t
It’s tougher now than breaking out of Shawshank prison
And as you’re hittin your prime
People say you been committing a crime
But I won’t quit till I’m home
I’ll chip the limestone a bit at a time
Wait! I’m a pale ass pale middle-class straight white male
I won’t have an alibi the day I fail
Cause if I ever went to jail, Mom would pay my bail
In a  heartbeat
Mom and Dad have given me a lot more than a pat on the back
And I gotta thank ‘em for loving me
From the moment I was strapped in a Volvo car seat
When I needed a pep talk
I couldn’t remember to wreck shop
Writer’s block, staring at my laptop desktop
Or sleeping in my rental in a turnpike rest stop
Shit in storage, living from a suitcase
Thinking “this is how a silver spoon tastes?”
Cause you can make a dream possible
But it’ll never be easy, no matter what you chase
If you wanna poke fun then do so
I’ll do it for you, it’s no crime
I’m like if the dude from Juno grew a Jewfro and liked to rhyme
 
So tell me that I’m not a rapper
Tell Rudolph he can’t pull sleighs
Tell Pluto it’s not a planet
And he’ll probably keep spinning in the same old way
On and on, every day
Right around the sun, wanna feel the rays
You do it ‘cause you love it like nothing else in the universe
And fuck it, it’s embedded in your DNA

Boom! It was really loud. I mean, seriously loud. Boom! Boom! Boom!
Were you scared?
I'm probably like... I'm probably like the one who was getting scared like... Ten times... more often... Then anybody else I know!
I think people that say that they're not scared are lying about not being scared
Yeah... So is people saying that they're not ticklish",https://genius.com/Watsky-fireworks-lyrics

Flushed ass face, flash that cash

4AM Monday,A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"I know why they call them labels
Because you have to fit a label now to fit a label
But If I'm a pussy, then I guess I did my kegels
I got it on lox, I'll bring the bagels
It kind of feels like middle school again when they call
I think the majors can't decide if I'll come play ball
If I can make them money
If I can dumb my shit down enough
Or do the dance
I think it's kind of funny
They might be right, I'm shaped different like Toblerone
I turned down a quarter mil to pitch a mobile phone
Cause I believed that I can be more and walked away
And left my hand up in the air like I just shot the J
White rappers make it quicker if we talk like stars
Hit the A-list
Cause you puffed on Ls
And dropped your Rs
Let's pull some video out of 5th grade pageant
And compare the way you talked then to how you're rapping
You think you sound the same?
Or that you picked up the way to be real in somewhere TV-Land along the way?
If I just get 15 minutes I'm gonna stay myself
And when that 16th minute comes then I won't hate myself
Maybe I'll never get signed
I'll fucking flatline
But nobody gets to raise a banner during halftime
Win or lose, I always choose myself and place a bid
And make the same face on every play like Jason Kidd

It's almost 4AM
Monday in my room again
Got a crazy vision of a dream escaping from my pen
I'll be swinging going down
Fuck that noise, No way no how
You're listening to this song
But I'm working on the next one now

If my goals are odd I take as a challenge
People seem confused by how I hope to use my talents
Could he be weird Al, could he be Jimmy Fallon?
I tell them to imagine Mos Def meets Woody Allen
Haters give me balance. Every Kyle's got a Cartman
I know how failure tastes
I drink it straight from the carton
I always keep a gallon in the fridge at my apartment
To remind me how it feels to drop the ball like Stevie Bartman
Believe me I want to achieve it all by being me
It's too easy to be cheesy on TV or DVD
I'm seeking to sneak in, but I'm weeping when I peep the scene
Cause I'm knee-deep in it and need a TP roll to keep it clean
I'm digging for a deeper meaning cause beneath this skin is a beating the temperamental heaving heart of gentle heathen
If you deceive us, homie that's so sad
I'll get more agro than the Aggro Crag
I'm Boney Boney leave me aloney you know me well
Don't dwell on that Jabroni just cause that baloney sells

I want to flow holy like matrimony bells",https://genius.com/Watsky-4am-monday-lyrics

Even wombats
Love a fruit bat
Hate a combat
Love a comerade
Hate a Comcast bill
I don’t want to battle but if you really wanna fight then you can fire at will
Let’s just play pirates 'till
Legit we’re scallywags
Hit me in the leg and put a peg in it instead
And then I bet that it’ll benefit my Cali swag
Hey where’s my rally rag?
Maybe my fanny pack
Winning winning winning
Every inning, every round
And when I’m down I’m gonna hit like Manny Pacquiao
I’m running laps now
Do jumping jacks
Celebrate our friendship in a slumber party
Killing in a pillow-fight and with my Rumble Pak
I don’t hit punching bags
I pick the pumpkin patch
Who’s the little pisher so ambitious that he’s bigger than his britches
And has got two thumbs attached?
O hai!

And Ellen for getting the cougars to check it

I look at myself in the glass and go ‘Oh what?!’
Taking a bit of a nap, then I’m waking up for snack time
Making our way to the back of line, ’cause we don’t cut
Never get up at the crack of dawn if I can help it
Wanna be able to tag along when sun is setting
Gotta be open to having a long and healthy session
Taking the love I got and then I try to spread it
Why would I want a pet if I can’t even pet it?
I don’t know! I don’t want any lame pet
Me and my pet are winning
It’s game, set, match
I worship Biggie, Pharoahe, Eminem, and Busta Bust and Mr. Fade to Black

Lovely Thing Suite: Knots,x INFINITY,2016.0,"What a tangle
What a strangling knot to be caught in
To be exiled here
To be stuck in Berlin with Vienna so near
Yet so far from the Emperor’s ear
What a strange and impossible sum
To be old while to still be so young
To have sung before speaking a word
To be heard
To be hailed
Then to fail
To be done
To love but to be so naive
To trust and to be so deceived
To mourn, forlorn, to be torn from you
Scorned for another who suffers no grief
To curse God, seeking lightning
And to still be ignored
To hide in this room, now too rich to afford
To hear armies of creditors bang at the door
Always yelling for more
And to have nothing to sell that could help
Except for the Steinway that sits in the corner

For Arthur it all came too easily
To learn the scales in every key
To play the etudes and the suites
The nocturnes and The Fantaisie
To master the sonatas, minuets, and symphonies
To seek the truth fits and starts
To strike the middle F like it’s an arrow through the heart
To wing the right hand like a dove (the peaceful flutter of a dove)
And with left a violent shove (some moments will demand a shove)
To needle gently yet relentless with a steady foot upon the pedal
And to clench the iron first inside the velvet glove
To learn to whisper and to scream
(the whisper justifies the scream)
To let each yearning finger breathe
(no, nothing lives unless it breathes)
To burn, to worship, to mislead
To pose a question with a pinky on a key
To flee, to fight, to bleed
To float in air
Nothing solid underneath
To rap those heavy knuckles on the gate to heaven til there’s nothing to
Achieve, but—
To go retrieve the length of cable hidden in the cabinet
To metamorphasize the twisted rope unto an alphabet
To lay the lazy C upon the shabby wooden floor to rest
To send the end across the top and bend the C into an S
To curve the tail beneath the S to turn the tangle to a B
To hug the wretched root around the fibers suffocatingly
To wrap again to wrap again to give the coil seven loops
To penetrate the yawning hoop
To tug the loose appendage through
To yank the knot until it’s ready for the job it’s got to do
To toss the braid above the ceiling beam and to affix the noose
To bid adieu to all of you until there’s nothing left to do but
Climb the chair
To cinch the collar
Find the edge
To step into the air",https://genius.com/Watsky-lovely-thing-suite-knots-lyrics
Lovely Thing Suite: Conversations,x INFINITY,2016.0,"I remember vividly
My tears dropping on the grey carpet on the top step
Pops giving me his best guess
Me confessing the burning question stressing and concerning me and
Turning me to a wet mess
It’s probably nothing
I get it, I’m aware
I know it’s probably stupid to be scared
But these days are flying past us and nobody seems to care
It’s like we’re sprinting towards a brick wall we’re pretending isn’t there
What happens when we hit it?
Do we split into a million bits
Or do we come back as a bullfrog and talk in ribbits?
What is it? What is it?
You got the answer so give it, so give it, so give it
Don’t lie, what happens when we die?
Dad says, Georgie I’m just guessing from what I’ve been told
Probably thinking, “How’d I raise this emo fucking nine-year- old?”
Since I’m sorta really not religious it’s a crapshoot
I roll a pair of dice
Although the thought of paradise is very nice
In my heart I know I don’t believe in magic
So I’m thinking maybe death is like eternal TV static
Or returning to the state before your birth
Absorbed into the earth
The fewer hours left the more they’re worth
I admit that it’s difficult to think about
I think everybody got a little bit of doubt
You don’t get to hide from it even if you shout
Not a soul on the planet gets to wiggle out
And he said that I know that’s it’s tough to take in son but it’s so early
I can see you’re in a hurry but don’t worry cause

That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long time
That isn’t for a long, long, long, long time

Life moves fast
Made the mistake of blinking, twenty years passed
Now I’m sitting in my living room in Brooklyn with my father
We don’t bother doing Christmas in the Bay any longer
It’s first time that we’ve had this conversation
He says “It’s tough to take in
I know we’re not quite ancient
But we’ve reached age where we should probably talk arrangements
We could take it several routes
We could sell the house
We can’t work forever, eventually money will run out
That’s a spot taking a loan would help us cover
Which would make it tougher to leave something for you and your brother”
Stop—can’t you see?
Every meal that you paid for me
All this power to chase a dream
All this privilege not to crave riches
But it’s plain to me the key fact is it’s easy to act like cash means jack shit if
You never lacked it
And the greatest honor I could have is to make a buck and pass back a
Fraction of all the happiness you gave to me
And I will never make you live where you don’t aim to be
Age is just data
We paint our story A to Z then dip out
R.I.P. rip out, we tear out the pages
Tear up the stage and we take a seat
Making a vacancy
Famous or not, we fade from the plot
Every day when a new night falls
I ride around the sun on this big blue ball
I get a bit further from the kid called Paul
And I get a bit closer to the big brick wall
But since inching up to that fence
I can run my fingers against all the bricks and mortar and sense
That it’s not so cold and so dense
And although I’m mournful I’ve known that I’m not immortal
I’m not banging into stone but I’m more heading through this portal
We’re born to return to home we’re all born to be mincemeat
Everything dies except for Papaya King hotdogs on 86th St
Dad hands me a napkin tells me it’s been the same since the fifties
He didn’t always love the city but dammit he’ll miss me
How can you miss something after you leave, I agree that it’s sad, but please
Don’t dwell on it Dad, because—

And they wonder how we'll raise our children
And they tell me that I'm living with a monster
And they whisper that she took up with a villain
But I don't see dragon's scales
And I don't see claws and fangs
All I'm looking at is arms that hold me
Brown eyes that understand
And when she closed those eyes one final time no pipers came
But I know I got a love that's truer than a military sniper's aim
But we won't die in vain
Tie that chain around my waist
And pull me from the bottom of the pit of hell up to your final resting place

Sarajevo, Sarajevo
You're the altar that I pray to
God is love and love is all we have

We were trynna run from the city
Had the hope and the pride of the kids
People wanna put up walls to divide us
Kinda fitting that we died on a bridge
Same souls, both sides of the banks
They say we're different and they're fillin in the facts
But they put the same metal in the bullets
And they put the same bullets in our backs
Kinda love that we got is one in a mill
Ain't no God that I pray to would wanna kill
It's not God but it's fear and it's politics
And a Molotov that was lit with a dollar bill
Don't say all is lost
Escape this holocaust

You could fill up the sea with the things I don't know
But I know what I feel and I know when it's real
And I hope that we heal
We're two drops of the blood and the tears
Over thousands of years of the clash of the steel
I'm not blind to the cycle
We’re pressed in the spine of a Bible
They define the divine by the title
But what did Christ say? To be kind to my rival
You're my kind of revival
It's true ya, my favorite Hallelujah
You my you my favorite Hallelujah

I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere

My head's up in the sky it's higher than the clouds are
I like to look up at the stars and wonder how far
From what I hear about a billion babies are delivered every day and so it's like the planet is a clown car
I know it probably shouldn't work, but we all fit
Like a Mickey D's Playplace ballpit
So lookie me, I'm about to jump up in it and be swimming through syringes like a mothafuckin dolphin
I could have an outburst
There's a lot of freaky people on the planet and it makes me want to crowd surf
Everybody everywhere dig downwards
It's what we work for
Party at the earth's core!
I don't know where to go to go far
But if I go, then I know I should go hard
And if I go and I never come back
Then I'll send a postcard
And a couple thumb tacks

Said I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere

Teacher said this party started with a loud bang
The way my ears are ringing I don't hear a sound mang
I'm steady looking at the crowd like a proud dad
For coming out instead of clicking on a mouse pad
Steal a bounce house, fill it full of helium
Ride it like a blimp because I think that It'd be really fun
To do a triple flip in zero gravity while puffing on a philly blunt and shooting stars with a BB gun
Tonight I'll look at something that I've never seen before
And I might even pen graffiti on a meteor
I can reach it, homie Veni, vidi, vici, it's all peachy got a vision of the future on a Ouija board
I didn't believe it, I
Thought it was CGI
Why don't you decide
If we're computerized?
Assuming you and I are alive
And tomorrow is the rapture
I wonder watcha wanna do tonight

I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere
I'm lookin', I'm lookin' I'm lookin' for energy, everywhere

I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna
I don't wanna I don't wanna end up as an anybody
Everybody is an anybody
Made of arteries and antibodies
And you never get to see confetti without getting bloody
If you read ahead you'll all be surprised
Spoiler alert!
We're all gonna die
But I'll be hooping in that driveway in the clouds
Shooting fouls with that big orange ball in the sky
And when I die wanna say well I made it
And be way celebrated
And remain as a staple
If I stay hella faded
Then I'll fade and my fate'll be the same as the fakers with the chains on the labels
It's a shame people do it for the fame and the cash
Not the flame and the passion I train through the pain and I frame every passage as a way to stay fit

I need the stamina, keep on like my grandmama
When I'm not on camera, I gotta be a man of my word
And be a greater guy, not some thin-as-paper guy
Like the times that Georgie Porgie kissed the girl
And made her cry
Saying, see ya later, bye, shit I say is pretty strange
Coming back for Christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
Fuck it, man, we're changing too, look at what we going through
Mama used to buy me shirts she said that I would grow into
But it's draping on me like an apron or a cape, a great tsunami
Wave of cotton that I'm caught in that she bought at Ross
I know the cost of it was probably awesome
But my style is sorta sloppy
I'll fit it when I blossom like a California Poppy
The tears are freezing on my cheek in Boston out in Copley
And I don't really know why, no, I don't really know why

All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is
All you can do, is

So pour that liquor out. I never chickened out
But if I got to make a second pick I'd take a different route
But a grip of my decisions pretty Mickey Mouse
I tried to join the 27 Club, they kicked me out
It was like I'm limping into heaven while my dick is out
And there's Amy Winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
But she spits it out the moment I come gliding in
She's all like, “come on Joplin, who the fuck invited him?!
Hide all of the Heinekens!"" No, they don't know my name
My heart is lowkey broken so I'm taking Novocain
And Jimmy Morrison, The Doors, and Brian Jones, you know, the Stones
Are joking, toking on a roach playing a poker game
I know that I'm a bastard. The walls are alabaster
Jimi plays his Stratocaster jamming out with Kurt Cobain
They're playing Purple Rain, or maybe Purple Haze
And Kurt says, “How the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways?”
I try to jump and spread my wings like I'm a bird of prey
But I hit the earth and break a mothafucka’s vertebrate (hey)
I guess I'm fucking up the blueprint for success
Woke up in the hospital with Jimi's bootprints on my chest
This recklessness, no common senses
I Kamikaze, there's consequences
I don't condone it, but I did it, I'ma own it
I've been living for the moment gotta go (go!) 'cause

Love Letters,x INFINITY,2016.0,"The drum is never the enemy of the pen
But when I’m meeting mentally with beat and melody then
One of me can turn into ten of me
If there’s ten of me, tell me how many heavenly similes can we blend?
Like women and men would fall with no friends
Like a rose would fall with no stem
Like most folks follow trends
Like Os follow LMNs
That’s how well I know life flows with the elements
As sunrise kills an evening
As stars die and a night sky is grieving
As man sees what he has when it’s leaving
You gone is as asthma to breathing
That’s how much I need you in my life
I’m never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime
Cause every time I hear line that shows me I’m not alone it’s saving me
Cause I know that that’s a lifeline
Like minds—
this is our home and they won’t ruin it easily
Cause the wolf is gonna blow until he’s blue in the cheek
And me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street
And the bulldozer can come chew on our feet
We never let em through
We’ll build a levy
Limit the river’s level
Steady the flood and begin with a pebble
Lend me one syllable
Come if you’re ready to shovel
Run if you’re shaking
But I know that today is not my Waterloo

You’ve made a place where I’m welcome
And although I give voice to it seldom
Know I love you
Nobody’s above you
And if you love someone then you tell them

Every day the planet’s losing IQ points
But people still bumping Ice Cube joints
So I’ve got hope
And every day I’m seeking my true voice and looking up at a bright new choice
Cause everybody’s got a hustle and everyone’s trying to push it
It’s tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit
And there’s another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter, money
And strippers they’re selling as good shit
It’s nothing new up at the core though
Everything same as it’s always been only more so
Of course so same token, while there’s life there is truth
While there’s truth it demands to be spoken
And someone’s gonna speak it
It’s really not a secret
You just need to search it
You just need to seek it
And though we like to worship a genius in a coffin
We often forget that there’s prophets among us walking
And I know because I hear em when I am in the clouds
And I got my music up and jamming it loud
And dammit whatever I am or could ever become I’m positive that I will
Always be a fan in the crowd
So gimme gimme gimme
Dylan and Biggy
Hit me with Jimi, Emily Dickinson, Eminem, Niki Giovanni, Lennon, Kendrick, Gambino, Rafa, Chinaka, Dahlak and Missy,Saul and Beau and Paul and Kweli, Chali 2na and Chance and Seneca

(Go in poet!)
86 anyone who would stand in the path of a kid saying
(Go in poet!)
86 bitches, 86 cups full of lean
(Go in poet!)
86 bars, infinity ways to say what I mean

You’ve made a place where I’m welcome
And although I give voice to it seldom
Know I love you
Nobody’s above you
And if you love someone then you tell them

So if you’re blocking the future I wanna to walk toward
Suit yourself we’re gonna lock swords
But it’s a wash if you’re saying “Watsky I could rock withcha if you didn’t talk
Like some nails on a chalkboard
I can tell—that you’re really on your dope writer tip
But you’ll trip if you don’t try to fit
Maybe you can make it if you ghostwrite a hit
And sell it to somebody who can ghostride a whip”
Shieeet—I say no sirree
I can smell the weak shit through the potpourri
So I’m just gonna do what I do
You take a minute or two and Google “Tim and Magoo”
I love the life that I picked even if it ain't plush
I’m too glad to complain much
I’m in the lab in a drab world
While these fuckers dab and do dabs and I dab on my pad with my paintbrush
This is for the kids whipping up some home-cooked
Spitting 86 bars, fuckin no hook
Lying in the grass
Passion in their chest
And a ballpoint pressed in their notebook
Listen to me, this is for the word
Looking so fine I’m rubbing coconut oil up in the crack of that spine
This is for the times I’m reminded my mind isn’t mine alone
This is for the poems and the lines
(And the letters in em)

Dedicated to Christina Li,Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"The first time I went back to homeroom from the hospital
I thought that being more embarrassed was impossible
But God, the second time it really turned my stomach
Now I’m the kid who collapses and then spazzes out in public
This time was a bowling alley, the first was in the yard
And kids in middle school just watched me trip and kicked me hard
Except this girl named Crissie Li, who flips around at her desk
And gives me the world’s biggest Disney card
Wrote “best wishes,” and “kisses” where she signed it
3 feet by 2 feet, I coulda hid behind it
I didn’t like the pity from Christina Li though
I’m thinking “Crissie, can’t you see I’m busy being emo?”
‘Cause I think I mighta heard she maybe sorta liked me
And since she wasn’t cool enough I guess I took it lightly
Had braces and glasses and wasn’t Mrs. Popular
And so I didn’t really give a thought to her

A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping
It’s the notes of the song that’ll never happen
And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping
But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping

There’s holes in my memory- it isn’t photographic
There’s holes in my yearbook but the cut-out folks were plastic
Ten years pass, I don’t cross paths
With half the people from my class again 'til we meet at Crissie’s open casket
Those who chose to ask it probably knew
I could have dug in deeper if I’d wanted to
But you couldn’t tell a thing was off on the surface
And I didn’t know she was sick until I heard about her service
She was born with a heart defect, used to the cold knife
She’d been in and out of hospitals her whole life
She knew the whole time, and never said why
She felt my pain herself and helped me hold my head high
The nicest folks are those who know the throes of crisis
Though I know it’s crime to twist her life to fit my own devices
Why’s it so hard to mourn, and then try to learn by this
But lights that burn shortest
Are the lights that burn brightest

A heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping
It’s the notes of the song that’ll never happen
And the wind in the leaves is the sound of ghosts clapping
But a heart breaking sounds like guitar strings snapping

Our 8th grade yearbook page for dedicating songs wasn’t long
Even in a school eleven hundred strong
The yearbook advertised for months, but when it’s said and done
Crissie bought six, the third most of anyone
Alvin got “Your Faith in Me” by Jessica Simpson
Pebbles got Richard Marx’s ballad “At the Beginning”
It feels like sloppy poetry the way her life would end
After sending Mariah Carrey’s “Any Time You Need a Friend""
But corniness is honesty that’s wrapped in cliché
And most slow jam lyrics aren’t shit I’m brave enough to say without a smirk
But before she went to dirt she left us finally
""I Will Remember You” to Geoff, Mike, Bry and me
You can plot if you must
Say it’s obviously fate, or explain that God is just
But all I know is that until my body’s dust
I will try to think of her as much as Crissie thought of us

This one goes out to Christina",https://genius.com/Watsky-dedicated-to-christina-li-lyrics
Lovely Thing Suite: Roses,x INFINITY,2016.0,"Don’t let my ghost drag you down
If you don’t see me around
It doesn’t mean that I fell
Yeah I’m doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I’m gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell

When magic’s happening my habit’s been coiling up a memory and trappin it right
In the cavity of my ribs, like the doors of a cabinet might
But you won’t hold onto a shadow just by grabbing it tight
Set it free and let it back in the light
Never out of my heart, even when out of my sight
Leaving is s'posed to be hard
Man I thought it so was selfish of people I love to keep falling out of my life
But now I know
No I don’t take it personal
If you got a really lovely place to go
I will chase my goals, yeah, to make me whole
Cause it’s urgent we love and be loved
I’ve begun to scrub up with detergent to shine up my soul

Don’t let my ghost drag you down
If you don’t see me around

Yeah I’m doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I’m gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell
To answer the bell
I got some roses to smell

Cause every screen that we tap is screaming that bigger is better
Better is how you make yourself matter
But matter is fleeting
Am I living to feed a machine that I’m blind to see?
No point in hiding my pride if there’s no privacy
I’ve already dedicated too much of my time to trying to get my followers up
And crying out for attention
And sleeping around to mend a hollow crater inside of me
Knowing well that it don’t mean shit
Going to the well for another cheap dopamine hit
I’m done being a bitch to ambition
I’m already rich
I got a head that’s full of million dollar questions
And the length of it
Is I don’t need the courage to work
I want the strength to quit

Don’t let my ghost drag you down
If you don’t see me around
It doesn’t mean that I fell
Yeah I’m doing well
I got some roses to smell
I hope you smile when I’m gone
It means I had the strength to move on
To find another story to tell

S for Lisp,UnKnown,UnKnown,"So someone said to me the other day I've got a lisp
A stranger, you know, they said I've got a subtle lisp
And I should know I sound a little stupid doing spoken word
When all my words with ""S"" in them are spoken so absurd
And I'm not upset, okay it just sucks
To think you're speaking normally for two decades
And then shucks—
Find out your stuff sounds like a stanza of Severus Snape's toughest parseltongue is pronounced by Daffy Duck
So I will say this:
My subtle lisp is not sinful
I'm not sorry Saturday, I'm not sorry Sunday;
I'm spiritual and when I speak
I celebrate the Sabbath seven days a week
I've got special S sauce smothered on my skull walls like a tossed salad so silkscreen the Sistine ceiling on my soft pallet
I sing along with super scenesters
Reciting Sufjan Stevens songs in skinny jeans
Dance salsa with soccer moms
Sneaking out in skimpy see-through sarongs
I will answer your questions in stout
With my sexy subtly lisping sparkling incisor small
What's my surname? Watsky
What's my size? Stocky
My city? San Francisco
It's so sweet, now slow
See, I've heard some steamy stories of oral sex
But I'm not stretching to say one time
I made a lady climax by speaking an essay section
Of a Shakespeare sonnet in her split legs' general direction
I scribble all S-Essays I shred them and sprinkle the whole S-ashes
My speech doesn't give a spotted sea snail if it passes
I slipped past straight Fs to straight Ss in my classes
Because my speech stay second-semester senior status
Seriously so so so so soon
So sick sixth grade school kids call me sofa king
I'm on tongue steroids
Slammin' with the Sammie Sosa swing
So tight I sleep upright in a small cell in Sing Sing
And sail the seven seas on Steve Irwin's stingray
While your speedboat's sinking
It's still too soon
Anyway, screw an S.S.O.S
I'm straight S.S.S for Save Someone's Standards
Studied at Emerson; the school of savage speech
Sup, Stanford?
I spit sexier than Summer Sanders, Sarah Silverman
Susan Sarandon, Sissy Spacek, Sally Struthers, and Selena
Spooning in a 6-way same-sex all S celebrity civil union
So, you can slander the gay lisp
And I will slip you a solid list of friends
Or 60% of Emerson; who
Lisp or no lisp, will stomp, spit, stay pissed
And start all over on the racists
You can save the South Korean stereotypes
The Sambo shtick
The sexist shit is sickening
And if you suppose your speech is normal
Its 'cause your impediment is listening
Speak for those of us with something special
Something that sets us aside from my—
Accent havers, my... stammerers
My southerners, my st-st-stutterers
Yes, I will spit it sick and stick to never skipping ""S""
'Cause I was—
Suckin' on a soup spoon and I suckled it to sterling silver
Simple, supple, super soaker
Staying watching Sister Sister
Scenage syllables coming esophagus
Move up there this place is
Sufferin' succotash
Second place isolate oxygen
There's no stopping this
I start this step of speaking
You should see that I will not desist
I'm sorry!
CUSPI, if you don't like a subtle lisp
Then you can simply suck on thissssssss",https://genius.com/Watsky-s-for-lisp-lyrics
Lovely Thing Suite: Theories,x INFINITY,2016.0,"Arthur stepped off, yeah he stepped offa the chair
Couldn’t weigh a hundred forty pounds
And the rope snapped, yeah, the rope snapped
And then Arthur found himself looking up from the ground
Looking up, looking up, found things looking up
Looking up, looking not so down, no not so down
No knots don’t have to stay that way
No, not so tightly wound
What a lovely thing it is to fail
To release those grasping fingernails
Arthur thought the end was near
Then Arthur played for fifty years
And then my father walked down 8th and 57th street to
Carnegie Hall, yeah it was Carnegie Hall
The show was past sold out for weeks
But they said “if you don’t mind, if you don’t mind sitting on stage
Sometimes we release a couple seats”
Twenty feet, twenty feet, yeah my dad’s twenty three
Twenty feet from the hands on the keys
Yeah, the hands on the keys of a man with the hands that almost didn’t exist
That almost didn’t exist to see
Back in '97 when Dad was my chauffeur
He’d play radio and I’d try to guess the composer
Chopin sprinkled over the hum of the motor
When I was young never I’d doubt my composure
Everything’s kosher, man I was so sure
I’d say that I’m good (I'm good)
Don’t want no adulthood
I never understood
Couldn’t get how anyone would ever want to end to their life
Until the day that I could
I’ve heard it said we’re alone in the ether
That we’re the only intelligent creatures
So you don’t need to adjust your receivers
If they were out there they’d be texting us, hitting our beepers
Invading us on some alien Julius Caesar
Or begging “take me to your leader”
But I got a theory it’s neither
That there’s a billion brilliant alien planets at leisure
Smoking alien reefer
The evolution of the mind’s not the hunger to conquer
Or to want or to seek or to wander
Or even wonder, but to simply to be
Until we cease to be any longer
There’s nothing wrong with heavy eyelids
I hope you enjoyed my twenties as much as I did
You’ll never know how much that all of you provided
And I’m gonna try to do the same for my k-",https://genius.com/Watsky-lovely-thing-suite-theories-lyrics
Nothing Like The First Time,Nothing Like the First Time,2012.0,"The first time I ate avocado was so amazing that I came
And that was the first time that I came so the only thing I could compare it to is the taste of avocado. Almost the same
The first time I got high, I ran into my friend’s bedroom and I hung onto each corner of the mattress because I knew that I would be flung into space if I didn’t hold tight
Two years before that I went to my first concert. I was high all night. And the first time someone clapped for me on stage I floated three inches off the pavement walking home
Only one girl has ever really wrapped my stomach into pretzels. She didn’t give me butterflies. She gave me pterodactyls
I’m talking terrible internal bruising
 
and the first time I kissed her was like the first time I saw fireworks, which was like the sky first kissing me in the eyeballs
In high school the self-defense counselor taught us that to defend ourselves against a rapist, by sticking a thumb into the corner of his eye socket and popping it out like a grape
Babe, for the chance to be with you, I would pop my own eyeballs out and say, ""Here. I only have eyes for you.""
So everywhere you went you’d carry me around in your pocket and every time you pulled out a handful of loose change I’d get to wink at you and a thousand miles away you would think of how charming I am— me— weaving blindly through LA traffic. You— in some bullshit other place
But you shouldn’t leave first times until the end of summer
Because you went off to college, years passed, and I realized I was the only one calling anymore
And that first kiss hardened into the last.
 
My love : retarded, preserved, a pterodactyl in a tar pit,
 
the music over before it started, a lost guitar pick
I’ve stopped trying to match it, searching for that magical attachment
Because marriages are not fucking Disney
Bad marriages are sandcastles
Good marriages are McDonald’s hamburgers
You can leave a good marriage on a plate in the sun for fifty years and it stays pretty much the same
They key, I hear, is to fight routine— to make the smallest moments gleam and mean something
And if you ever feel yourself fading, face paint your old and aging creased-up cheeks gold-plated with a jar of first-time and if you need a youthful spruce-up just grab a tube of that newb juice and lube up and if you’re hurting just rub the good stuff where you’re burning
But a word of warning
The first time tends to make the bad times worse
There’s the rub
It doesn’t make things better, just louder
It amplifies a murmur ... er-er
Great is greater. Greater is greaterer. And broke ...is broker. And bone... is boner
It’s not a perfect formula
But the first time that I kissed you, the door of your crappy Civic already half-open, you said ""I’m glad you did that.""
And I have a feeling that, for you, it wasn’t a first-time
It was a ""this one time.""
But I will remember that moment for the rest of my life, even if I have to arm wrestle Alzheimer's for it
And if I ever get a chance to kiss you again, you know, a second time, I'm gonna stick my tongue out and lick you right across your face. Because I’ve already kissed you. But I never licked you
And you’ll say, ""Ugh. Why did you do that?"" And I’ll say, ""Hey sexy. Did someone slap you across the face with a banana slug or is that a big shiny trail of first-time on your cheek. Maybe we can go back to my place and gets some first-time on the sheets.""
It’s worth it
After all, there’s nothing like the first time
The first time’s always perfect",https://genius.com/Watsky-nothing-like-the-first-time-annotated
Seizure Boy,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"Seizure boy?

The first thing that happens is the world goes black
You just hear a little snap when your neck rolls back
You don't bite your tongue off or foam at the lips
But before you hit the ground there's a moment of bliss
It's like toking a spliff, it's like shedding your skin
It's better than the best train wreck there's even been
You have to let it in, as much as it's upsetting
To wake up with bruises you don't remember getting
You don't remember how the hell you ended up indoors
You don't remember whether you were wetting your gym shorts
In front of Amanda, the girl you're after
Who already thought you were a fucking disaster
It's not like a last will, it's making me laugh
Unless you get your next one while you're taking a bath
I'm seizing the mic fast at middle school dances
I'm done being seized and I'm seizing my chances

I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch

I got baby blues
You got navy blues
Paid your dues
Name the tune
Name a hue:
What shade are you?
I see Purple People Eaters more than world leaders
And I've jumped a couple hurtles, burned some sneakers through the meters (copacetic)
Please, get the medic
Let it breathe
And I'll be the baddest motherfucking epileptic I can be
I would grieve
Asking why's it me sleeping in the ER with an IV in my arm and my V card hurting saying, ""God fuck if I'ma die a virgin""
I'ma grab the first nurse working, flirt and draw the curtain
So who's perkin Doctor Phil's Pills
Tyler Durden Still ill
Thrillville, Uma Thurman hurting in the Kill Bills
This is to my sick kids
Time to flip this shit
Depakote, Adderall, Ritalin, pixie stix
I don't give a fuck what you ridin' to the setting sun
Use it as a weapon when it's said and done

I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch
I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch

Say that I'm crazy or call it a pitfall
I'll win a game of bloody knuckles hitting a brick wall
It's pinball hitting the limit to smash that glass
Taking a minute to sit in the whip and then I'm gonna mash on gas
'Cause I'll be crashing that impasse with fat ass syntax
Skinny motherfucker off a bucket of Slimfast
You ever had a Gran Mal seizure in gym class?
Had whiplash back when life was dishing out pimp slaps
Fed up and we've all been better but I'm set to step up
Never let up 'cause the fall is just the setup now to get up
Regret'll never get the better of me with a sawed off
When I'm having trouble talking someone knocks my writer's block off
If my eyes glaze and my knees drift south
And you ever think to stick a credit card in my mouth
I take Mastercard and Visa for my risk rewards
I'm not biting my tongue, why don't you bite yours?

I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
I said, ""It's all too much""
And if the world breaks your legs you go and beat it with your crutch

Rich Girl,Nothing Like the First Time,1977.0,"You´re a rich girl, and you gone too far
´Cause you it don´t matter anyway
You can rely on the old man´s money
You can rely on the old man´s money
It´s bitch girl, but its gone too far
´Cause you it don´t matter anyway
So money money won´t get you too far, won´t get you too far

Am I the only one who thinks a bit of soul is nice?
Some women suck it from you like the poltergeist
Cause I can tell the time of day without a diamond on my wrist, I give a __ about your rolly's price
I like em bold, and I'll roll the dice
Cause I been crushing on all these crunchy granola types
I'm over being over it and women on a mission got my heart melting like polar ice
I might
Be looking for a little bit of Bay
A little San Francisco in these women in LA
Ashe
Nothing I can say
And if you're being fake
You should be walking away
I don't play babe
Don't give a damn how low your earrings hang
Your favorite brand, I don't need to hear it, dang
Cause Everybody's born naked and maybe later I'll be licking on your Gucci
And you, rubbing my Vera Wang


Sooner or later you'll figure out it's a hard world
You could get stronger doing arm curls
But this is a stickup and I'm coming saying break yourself, better give me that heart girl
Just put it in the bag
And if I give it back
Don't put it in the trash
Cause I been looking for a partner with a passion saying
Don't recycle
Don't recycle me
But in this economy
I don't really think it's cute for you to flaunt your property
What about some modesty?
That would be a shock to me
Cause the only time you walk on the block is on a shopping spree
Mother-eff that song and dance
Baby girl there's not a chance
Not unless you wanna grab a coffee in pajama pants
We'll be looking like we just rolled out of bed together
All we really need is you and me

 You need to go to City Hall to get a permit
 Alright
 You need to stop what you're doing
 How much would that permit cost?
 I don't know, just go to City Hall and talk to a special events organizer and see if they can give you a special permit for that
 Okay
 I'm really sorry

Ink Don’t Bleed,All You Can Do,2014.0,"Some got hits about the racks that they earn
Say there's Benjamins and Jacksons in their pockets to burn
But when they shoot the video, producers pass around a bucket
Full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return
I know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder
A vegan on the mic whose screaming that meats murder
But when everybody's sleeping he be creeping
Slugging back the whiskey
Hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger
There's a pop idol at the top of the charts
And when her records being cut she's on the beach in St. Barts
While a session singer who didn't have the face to make it
Signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts
It's hard, 'cause I got bars that are big uppin' Woody Allen
But maybe he's a predator whose diggin' in his talons
There's a balance and often I don't know how to feel
In a fake and tainted world seek the real

Now, I can't change the past, but a man's gotta man up
It's hard to believe; sometimes, I get the best of me
Now, I'm doing what I can, but I'm a man, not a damn chump
I can say it if you need, but I'd rather let the ink bleed

We dismiss our heroes' skeletons, no matter how grim
My fans saying ""I'd be honored to be injured by him""
Well, fam, this branch is thin, but I'll go out on a limb
To say she didn't love her ulna poking out of her skin
Being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines
They cut off my jeans; I heard her in the ambulance scream
She's in school to do tattoos and mighta had nerve damage
So I could have cost a girl a chance at her dream
Meanwhile, he pops painkillers until the dude is numb
Knew I was a stupidass, just not that I'm a ruthless one
Youth is easily influenced
So should you be rooting for me if I touch a thousand lives
But on the way I ruin some?
The rule of thumb is ""all publicity is your advantage""
But human lives are not collateral damage
Bandage the wounded then vanish
Blank as the newest of canvases
When they zoom in the cameras, give them the truth

Now, I can't change the past, but a man's gotta man up
It's hard to believe; sometimes, I get the best of me
Now, I'm doing what I can, but I'm a man, not a damn chump
I can say it if you need, but I'd rather let the ink bleed

Megachurch leaders sleeping with male hookers
Mayors hitting crack pipes with their cookers
Each week a crooked politician gets caught
We're not shocked when they're cheaters
These days, we're shocked when they're not
Are they the person you thought if they're perfect and hot?
Often, we blame the victim; scoff
And ""they deserve what they got""
Actors sweep it under the rug and resume with the plot
But they're amateurs and we can see the boom in the shot
If perception is reality then this could be a shocker
I've done my share of fucked up things that didn't get on Gawker
Lots of tiny indiscretions way beyond the public eye
That if you saw would probably out me as a complicated guy
Mike says you got to separate the person from the art
But if the art's about that person, you can't pull them apart
So you better watch the choices that you're making now because
They aren't something that matter; they're the only thing that does

Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it so I guess it might be true
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it so I guess it might be true
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it so I guess it might be true
Everything they say conflicts with everything I do
But I must admit I did it so I guess it might be true",https://genius.com/Watsky-ink-dont-bleed-lyrics
The One,All You Can Do,2014.0,"Everywhere I look it seems like everybody's pairing off
I'm staring at the pairs like they were tits on Lara Croft
Even all the dogs I see are clicking so terrific
Picking out their favorite puppy's ass to sniff and stickin with it
All the faker single ladies twerkin to Beyoncé
Every single one of em is somebody's fiancée
You never spilled your guts. You wanted to yell your say
Wait a couple years and try again when they're divorcees
All the gentlemen are trynna get the pussy, wanna make that pelvis scream
But when I hit it and I quit it then it never really helps my self-esteem
We want some tonsil hockey,
 
but we got hecka cocky
Overfished the ocean, so we're running low on
 
tekka maki
Sushi
 
douchey dudes are saying 'do me' but we're doomed
We run away from keepers and go creepin on the goons
Most men and women full of crap, need a laxative
Want the ass when I'm waxin it, Uncle Sam how I'm taxin it
Do a backflip and try to land in it, then abandon it, pretty soon we're back to

1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4

There’s no such thing as “the one”

Wonderland is where I'll find an Alice who is radical
But I'm drunk on Facebook now and diving down that rabbit hole
Checkin on my ex and soon I'm creepin on her lover
And when the picture buffers I see her new boyfriend's buffer than me
Got those upper pecs his fuckin V-neck couldn't cover
My dick is  pretty lonely but my nuts still got each other
I suffer, suffer from a habit, yes I'm an addict
But someone else is out there, it's just simple mathematics
There's over 7 billion mothafuckas on the planet and 4 billion of us are of legal age
That's 2 billion ladies, 4 billion tittays, and I bet a couple of em aren't engaged
And I get it you've been looking for the one but they been running trynna hide like Kony
And you're gonna find em if you're getting back into the saddle, baby ride that pony
And if you never get over that early lover then it sucks for you
Gotta admit that it's difficult to be watching her with him but everybody want a love that's true
I'm waiting, batin’ patiently, yo I'm a catch
I'm losing my head, playing musical beds, and looking for “the one” that match

1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2, 3, 4
I don’t believe in “the one”

Cannonball,All You Can Do,2014.0,"I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine that I’ll ever be happy like before
Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone
Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud, rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones
Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs
We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry
So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stayed until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”
And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again
And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle, perfect and pink in permanent ink
The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses, this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure of your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe, it’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it

But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them",https://genius.com/Watsky-cannonball-lyrics
Midnight Heart,x INFINITY,2016.0,"Well I’ve made enemies along the ride
I’m afraid I could never be satisfied
But each way that I turn I face ahead

Straight through to your midnight heart
Straight through to your midnight heart
Now you know your soul is dark
Straight through to your midnight heart

You don’t know the name of like half of these folks
And they’ll be sprinting for the exit the minute you’re broke
A bunch of bobblehead muppets to laugh at your jokes
Wipe your ass and come and give your ego a stroke
I had to break it to you
Sorry buddy, it was time you knew
Nothing you ever said was funny, man the punchline’s you
One time for the palm trees and the sunshine
Two times for the two-timers being unkind
Confined to a small mind, but the fault’s mine
I always keep on crawling back across the San Andreas faultline
I keep on climbing underground to sweat out all my principles in darkness with you in this salt mine
Where we’re all blind, I should fall back, I know all signs say that I should halt
But I golf clap for this false crap
But from now on counterfeit suckers suck on my ballsack
(Alright?)

Straight through to your midnight heart
Straight through to your midnight heart
Now you know your soul is dark
Straight through to your midnight heart

Well I’ve made enemies along the ride
I’m afraid I could never be satisfied
But each way that I turn I face ahead

I know you know it’s way too late now and your soul is dark
Yeah motherfucker I see through you to your midnight heart
Straight through, straight through
Through-through-through to your midnight heart
Now you know, now you know
Straight through to your h-h-h-h-heart

It’s tough to care about stupid bullshit all of the time
So I gotta say I’m glad that’s your job and not mine
Everybody’s got a topic at the top of their mind
A choice of how you wanna let your life be defined
(Is it honeys?) Sleeping around is your taste?
(Is it money?) Are you the paper you chase?
(Kinda funny) You said that I’ve been playing it safe
You got the bravest voice, say that to my face
(Is it your career?) Pretty shitty to hear
But I took a difficult look in the mirror
And I checked in the rearview
Objects are never what they appear
The past tends to look crooked from here
The mask that I put on out of fear
The tracks that I didn’t put out
The facts that I kept out of my ear
The slack that I cut people who didn’t deserve it is tragically clear
No, no, no, not this year

I’m not done changing yet
I’ll get these old knees checked
I can’t bend over for someone I don’t respect

Well I’ve made enemies along the ride
I’m afraid I could never be satisfied
But each way that I turn, I look ahead",https://genius.com/Watsky-midnight-heart-lyrics

Yes Britannia,x INFINITY,2016.0,"I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

Yes, I’ve been a mess
With the pressure the stress
See ya never, I guess
Nevertheless, finding you I was blessed
Swear I’m trying my best
Lion inside of my chest
Trying to claw his way out
Crack my ribs, pop my lungs
I don’t know if there’s a safe route
Now—we can cut this frayed rope
Or hope and wait us to fade
Babe— after how great the ups were
We can’t be living with love when it’s lost its luster
Frosted over, busted, exhausted, ruptured
Another couple who settled for less
We want something real
A relationship
Wanna feel
And quit chasing shit
Gimme a shield
Or she’ll break me quick
And we will never be the same again

I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

All we’re seekin’s a person that we can cherish
I don’t think you really want a green card marriage
Nothing is fair but you’re caring and can’t bear it
A lot of people perished tonight in Paris
The planet is a mean motherfucker
You wanna scream but we gotta lean on each other
We suffer and pick ourselves up off of the floor
Your dad at stage four, what could I say to support?
Can we just quit each other
The way you did cigarettes?
Up and split, cold turkey, no regrets?
I’d even miss tasting the nicotine on your breath when we kiss
I’m not ready to say good bye to you yet
Like sayonara
I don’t know if I can try tomorrow
Am I supposed to say a hallelujah
Smile I knew ya
And go on my way?

I’m pleading guilty with the Crown today
That’s all I got to say
I will not lie to you
I had to try my luck across the sea
Now we’re history
I’m saying goodbye to you

Oh, yes Brittania
I surrender
Book me and toss the key

Little Slice,x INFINITY,2016.0,"And the clouds are red and pink like they're wearing a tube of lipstick
The sun is dimming while dipping a toe into the Pacific
Just gimme a hot jacuzzi
A spliff and we'll watch a movie
I'm spiffy, man in a jiffy I'm lifted and living groovie

I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice

I found the fountain of youth and went skinny dipping up in it
I pick up the lucky pennies, epiphanies every minute
I run the money to Coinstar and with the cash from the ticket
I snatch my homies whatever they want at Denny's and kick it
'Til the mothafuckin' Sun rise
So many folks I love right here
But it hasn't been a good night
Until the shit gets kinda weird

I got a stylish private island inside of my mind the size of Hawaii
And when I'm vibing you're likely to find me deep in my psyche
Hiding out peeping a flying V of neon pelicans filling the psychedelic horizon like
Wow, what just happened?
I'll please have what he is having
And how can I come ride that wave?

I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
And I just want my slice
(just want my slice pretty please)

Don't give a damn if I'm damp, I dance in the rain
I decided to celebrate like the sky is dumping champagne on me
Paint every clap of thunder as Heaven popping a bottle
Jump in and paddle the deepest puddles
Strap on my goggles
I gotta seek what I lack
When I'm weak, gotta act
I'm a freak, it's a fact
But I can't say that I mind
Gotta leave those thoughts behind
And I hop in my car and I bob in my seat
When I'm dropping the beat as I mob the beach
And I stop and I park at the top of a cliff in the dark
And I'm digging on the stars in the sea
Shining like a fistful of diamonds
That somebody went and threw into the sky but they ricochet off
And a couple of 'em fell into the water and they sink the bottom
And I think that I saw some
But I blink and lost 'em
And I drink in the awesome view
Infinite kilometers of water and the tiny ships moving across 'em
If I'm getting money then I get it while I can
But if I'm not, I better live it up and dammit I demand
To give it every single breath I got inside of me and try to be the man

I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
I don't need the whole pie
Just wanna have my little slice
I'm a groupie to the good life
Looking for a taste of paradise
And I just want my slice",https://genius.com/Watsky-little-slice-lyrics
Bet Against Me,All You Can Do,2014.0,"You will if you didn't feel it before
Ever since I was a kid never really been bored
Swinging from building to building with my umbilical cord
But they don't know what I really endured
They say Godzilla been summoned but we're not running
Attila the Hun is coming, we’re killin his horde
Spilling my innards, I fell on my sword
And now my blood is filling up from the ceiling to floor
I'm swimming though it, I'm swallowing fluid
Knew I had to do it so I grew like a million gills
Cause evolution is kill or be killed
Your Mrs. isn't equipped to be having kids
Have her listen to what I'm spitting
It’s like sniffing fertility pills
This illegitimate village idiot bridging original shit with digital
Catching a carrier pigeon, sticking a chip in his wing and hitching a ride
But there's a glitch in the system inside
Got this ambition, I'm keeping the freshest fish in my kitchen
I catch em quick when get em to bite (right)
This kind of killing could fill a pelican bill
And my delicatessen will keep my recipe tight (right)
You kinda Gollumy, go ahead try to follow me
But if you're solid we build a colony, bruh
Calling Me Maybe, they popping molly
These babies are sniffling like they're chuggin some quality phở

…I’m playing with the house’s money now, cause I thought we were on our way out during the Cuban Missile Crisis. I was, ah, in my late teens—I fell asleep waiting for the missile to fall dead center on my apartment, crash through the ceiling, and that was gonna be the end of everything. And I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and I was still alive…

That these aren't circus acts to make you clap, it's rap to make you think and act)

I'm not apologizing for a policy that makes a college kid go call himself Thugdog and not expect assault
I'm marching on and calling all dissenters who

Tears to Diamonds,All You Can Do,2014.0,"They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold

Got an issue but it’s getting bigger and bigger
In the beginning it was something minor
Got a rat up in my kitchen and we gotta get rid of it
So we’re bringing in a tiger
There's something inside her
Thought you were blissful
I heard you did it with a pink-handled pistol
But sadness, it tend to latch on
And it won't let go like a pitbull
Don't even know if you left a note
Should we blame the Depakote?
Or vilify the Abilify?
You were trying to find your vanilla sky
Then you unravel
Face down on rock bottom fucking chewing gravel
Because a human's so fragile - What can you do?

They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
We just need someone we can hold
They press our teardrops into diamonds
But they can't change our hearts to stone
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies
I know that we are not alone, we are not alone

I know it's sappy
But I want my family to be happy
Without becoming flatter than a sheet of paper
An army of zombies shuffling through a vapor
But I know folks who found something beautiful
And they credit the pharmaceuticals
For slaying the demons that they’re running from
It might have saved their lives and I'm one of em
But there's a limit to the shit you can endure
You get a prescription and you're thinking that it’s pure
But baby maybe it’s a problem when you got a problem
And you get addicted to the cure
The spike ain’t no mystery
We’re any penny in a billion dollar industry
And there's a mothafucka' living on the hill pushing pills
Stacking bills off our misery

Had a teaspoon that’s full of pain
Got an ocean that’s full of sorrow
Had a teaspoon that’s full of pain
Got an ocean that’s full of sorrow

[They press our teardrops into diamonds
They change our sorrows into gold
They're gonna turn our blood to rubies

Advanced Placement,Placement,2019.0,"What's in the recipe of an identity?
How do we get to be here?
Am I a maniac? Am I a brainiac?
And will it ever be clear?
I've been sticking my pennies into the back of my piggybank
Getting permission before I'm petting the kitty cat
I've been taking a minute for really shedding the baby fat
What up, what up, what up, what up, what up?
This bizarre unfolding of my wings was quite a trip (Trip, trip, trip
)
All the pretty colors in the sky began to ripple, drip and stipple like a Lichtenstein
Pimples on my mind
Hey, what's poppin' people? 
The apocalypse is nigh
Ever since the pitter patter of your little feet upon the patio
You knew you didn't want to be predictable
Coulda been so simple but you had to make it difficult
Got the city at your fingertip but got this shit to pull
Gotta keep on pushing it and pushing it and pushing till it falls down
Maybe you'll be laughing in the end
But I'ma keep at the edge of my seat 'cause you said what you needed
The web's undefeated, you do what you gotta: Hakuna Matata
So ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Gotta make it look easy
Simple as pi (31415926)
Gotta make it look easy
But this life is never (never) never (never) never (never) never (never)
One big piece of cake
One big piece of cake
Big fat piece of cake
Never (never) never (never) never (never) never (never)
Your ass is now in advanced placement
You could be ready for heaven above
I could be seventy-seven and killin' it
Puffin' a jay that I keep in the glove
Right by the rubbers so we could be intimate
And if you're tucking me into my bed
Baby then maybe we'll make illegitimate cinema
We could take out the camera
Take a look at my stamina, so mechanical
I'm not even an animal, not a vegetable
I'm not even a mineral, but I'm mythical
I've become metaphysical when I dig in my tentacles
With the temperament of a savant
For the benefit of better people who want to pick apart the script

Gonna hike it till I make it, it's a good call
Taking the mic and I spike it like a football
Like a running back
Like I'm under the gun but I'm never gonna crack
Never could fall
It's like I'm Arnold I'm
Skinny but I'm picking up a barbell fine
Gonna make it putting my pen to the paper poppin' out a novel in a minute
Like I'm R.L. Stine
Gotta try because I got a fool's chance
Grab the mic at a middle school dance
Take it from the DJ and I rap until they pull the plug out on me to stop it or until I get pants'ed
Fuck it, they can pull the plug I'm gonna kick it acapella, Dockers at my ankles, and I tell em what I'm feeling
Even if nobody is listening I yell it to the ceiling and I celebrate the fact that I'm alive and I'm breathing

Oh no (Oh shit), oh no (Oh shit), oh no (No, no, no)

You say it's your thing to be honest
Like it's kind of this token of pride
Well, to be honest, you're kind of a goddess
But being with you kind of kills me inside
You want me to explain it, well
It's sort of this look in your eye
Like you're cooking an egg on the hood of your car 'cause you looked at it hard
But my heart is the egg and you're watching it fry
I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna lie, I am gonna cry
But not right here
Give me like a minute, let me get up in my feelings while I pop my beer
Shit is getting muddy, and I'm seeking out the buddy
At the bottom of the bottle but it's not quite clear

I fetch, I sit a bit, but I'm not gonna stay
But if you wanna see me, you can see my feets
And my cute little cheeks when I'm walkin' away
You can see me sitting on the dock at the bay
You can see me lickin' on my crotch like a stray
But if you're gonna see me like a prop in a play
Gotta say, I'll be skippin' what you got for the day
Maybe you'll be thinking that I'm hot in the head
Or I'm sick of pickin' at my chicken pox in the bed
You can think what you like, I think I'll take a hike

Oh no (Oh no), oh shit (Oh shit)

Had some tight old pussy and got stuck in the PAASSSTTTT
I molest old age, Grab the best old babe, in a breast hold babe
Is your chest cold babe?
Are those boobs your goosebumps?
Hey sugar tits, can a pimp have two lumps?
Measure my heart prick, whatever the night
I use my dick as a yardstick to measure my height!
I'm healing myself, I have a hole in my pocket
And I'm feeling myself
I'm like WuTang, your arts cookie cutter like a Warhol soup can
The rapper who can destroy mere humans
Fuck your facelift, fuck your played whip
I built a spaceship, to ride in while you're crusing Earth
Lampooning all the aliens that emcee in the Universe!
The ten best rappers is a list of me
I exist to be, the greatest rapper in history
Built a time machine from Flava's clock and a saddle
Taught Plato to rap, then kicked his ass in a battle
I'm the best rapper alive
That gets mistaken for Michael Cera everywhere he drives

A New Kind of Sexy,A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"I got a new kind sexy
I'm working on a recipe for rich
And exotic combinations of some fresh kinds of sexy
A new kind of sexy

My face is like the California government
In terms of how it tends to budget what it's covered in
Hair follicles are public school doors
Every day I open up a new pore
And close two more
But it's improper now to comment on what's risen
Because pimples pop up commoner than prisons
It's all blackheads-- no justice now
But they get overcrowded and I bust em out
I'm like Pop! Pop! motherfucker, I'm a bad man
And some day my skin'll crack like the Badlands
Like my dad's is
But if that's all, I don't give a rat's balls
I'll wear them like they're badges
Damn a boyscout
They're manscout patches
Because I'm endowed, and how! Dammit
And I know my body makes you want to hang out bad
The way my skin is cleaner than a Shamwow ad
And someday you'll see my stubble from the Hubble
On my mama on the double I'mma look like Barney Rubble

Yo, I'm something like a Harry and the Henderson's
Notice every time my knuckles be married to the pen again
Cause follicles be flying out my wide pores
Double standard cause I love my body hair but mind yours, girl
I'm grizzly-esque, you bet he thinks the Yetis wonder ""Is he blessed?""
My shoulder hair sheen like a solar flare
I'm a polar bear seeking out a bowl of Nair
Was he fuzzy from his childhood or early days?
Every time I cook I guzzle up a dozen curly strays (yucky)
My tweezers stay plucking
Your girly gets to floss her teeth every time she's, well
Kissing on my lower regions
The reason that I keep hair's cause it's good for colder seasons
But in the summer time I'm the asshole
Sun bathing at the beach, belly like an afro
I got a plan laid for my next bland date
Tell the boring breezy wait I forgot to manscape

But for now
I got a new kind sexy
I'm working on a theory of a new
And experimental blend of different rare kinds of sexy
A new kind of sexy

I got a couple regrettable tattoos
But you can't see them when I wear a black suit
Got drunk off of Jagers out in Vegas last June
And them water parks kids yell ""Look at that douche""
You know saying 'if looks could kill'?
Well my style is harmless, I shop at GoodWill
End of hipster, swap me hood feel
Four strip Adidas but that shit look real
Call me a fashionista, skinny dude
Give me food, cash or VISA
A freeloader who reeks of weed odor
Trying to get the freaks to scream like Ricola
One chick for me and one chick for Watsky
He love them older women that be screaming out ""Yatzy!""
Topsy-turfy, I'm not so pervy
Compared to Intuition, well like them girlies
We like them brown, Puerto Rican, or Haitian
A new kind of sexy is sweeping the nation

I'm impatient but
Yesterday I bought a pullup bar
I made plans to go jog down the boulevard
I changed my culinary choices from full of starch
To full of shit
It's a total farce
I haven't run a lap in years
But I'll crack a beer
And run the poker table like a fucking racketeer
Boom shakalack-fuck
Let's have a potluck
I got a hot buck burning a hole in my pocket
So let's hit the tac-truck
Jock's suck
Just throw everything we got in the wok
And let's grub till it looks like we're knocked up

Dent in the Moon,Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

Yeah, you see them craters?
That was ‘cause a kid said there’d be none greater
In ten years Hammering Hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later
Skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack
Watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap
Watch him rinse and repeat till he’s on the map
Going from the cheap seats to the autographs
Papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever, ever, ever rock a Dodger hat
And whether you win or you didn’t you gotta be getting dirty
And we better send your jersey to the laundromat
It was in the cards
I knew someday I’d be a big league star
Playing second base for the Giants wearing number 9 rocking knee-high socks
If I just worked hard

Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

We had our 6th grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts
So a fastball—had hops
We didn’t have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders
Off the asphalt—I dropped
A lot and so he hit ‘em faster and I took ‘em off my ankles
Yelling that’s all you got?
And when I saw my name on the roster I went insane
Like I was sniffing bath salts, I’m not—here to play soft
I’ll go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off
Until it rains candy out of its neck-hole
I don’t go flexing my pecs, or get swole
I wasn’t the fastest
And when I moved it kinda looked like I was running through molasses—true
It’s silly to give a shit about a game but earth
Is a little ball that’s spinning on its axis—too

Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon

I wasn’t cut out for the bigs, guess I been a fool
And middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule
But when you step into the ranks of the man
It’s like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool (thanks)
It’s time to ballroom waltz that plank
We’re little minnows in a small shark tank
You try to swim without getting blood in the water
But you’re all heart and guts like a ballpark frank
Never an all-star
I had to keep score
If I were perfect I would quit and join the Peace Corps
I’m not a hero, if I didn’t try my doubts eat at me
Like I’m a carcass on the sea floor
So say this shit is too corny
It tastes better to me than, ‘ooh poor me’
I’m just trying to sing a different tune
And then fit into a world that didn’t have room for me

Swing, out of your shoes
And if you should lose this time
Keep on swinging and swinging and soon
When you connect
With all of your strength
Look up and you might see a dent in the moon
Swing, out of your shoes

There’s a bunch of us who loved you
Fucking stuck here pointing fingers at ourselves for something you did
You you you you you packed your problems in a suitcase
You you you went away forever to a new place

The Legend of Hardhead Ned,Cardboard Castles,2013.0,"Once upon a time in a remote Tasmanian trailer park
There was born a baby boy by the name of Nedson Willbry
One day when Nedson was a baby, his crackhead teen mum
Got real distracted watching Teen Mum on the telly and dropped Ned right on his noggin
Leaving a bump on the top of his head
The little bean stopped squirming
And his mum thought he was surely done for
So mommy brought the tiny bundle to the forest during a terrible storm
And left him for dead in a field of pumpkins and wolves

Just then lighting struck
And a cry cut through the night light like a siren on a fire truck
Ned survived by the slightest luck, he wasn’t a dead baby, Neddy was alive as fuck!
It was a miracle we’re hearing
The creatures of the evening came creeping to the clearing
To see this little man nugget
Soon to be immortalized in poetry just like the man from Nantucket
But as the little babe was grown
They gave to him their home
And raised him as their own
He roamed and trapezed from the tallest trees (whee!)
He got his steez from the wallabies
They all loved him
But the Tasmanian Devils loved little Neddy more than all of ‘em
They taught him how to spin like a fan
'Til Ned spun himself into a fine young man
But one day like a sick disease
Loggers crept in and chopped the eucalyptus trees
They smushed the cuddly forest creatures
And turned ‘em into body wash and sneakers
But Ned escaped and yelled angrily
That ""You abandoned me!
You killed my family!
But God dammit, I can’t use your pity""
And he snuck onto a ship bound for New York City

Ned’s voyage led him to the deepest, darkest, dankest bowels of that ship
He met all kinds of seedy characters on that voyage, like old Japanese men and their wives
He had delicious meals of fresh cut sashimi, pumpkin pie
And all kinds of delicious breads and cookies and cakes
When he was on that voyage he knew what lied ahead
So he kept his sights set on New York City
And before he knew it, he arrived

Ned almost drowned
He kissed the ground
But his guts were churned up in this town
Where down was up and up was down
So the boy from Down Under flipped right around
Ned did a cartwheel and stopped halfway
And he walked on his palms from that day
But city-folk treated Ned like a freak
“That hand-walking lump-headed Yeti can’t speak”
One night walking home Ned was quite shocked
He saw a B-boy spinning on the sidewalk
He couldn’t stop, wouldn’t stop
Staring at those limbs, spinning like a wooden top
Sweeter than a puddin’ pop, Ned was home at last
And every night he’d watch ‘em dance through the glass
Of the club, and he’d wait there in line for his chance
But the bouncer said, freak, you can’t dance!

Oh but Ned, sweet little Ned, he wouldn’t get out of line
And the bouncer pushed him, and pushed him
But to catch his balance, Ned, hardheaded, upside down Ned did what Ned did best
He just spun. And he spun. And he spun. And he spun!
(Go Ned, go Ned, go, go, go Ned!)
Everyone in the club came out to watch what is now regarded
As the greatest fucking head spin of all time
Legend has it that Ned’s still out there on Bleecker Street
Spinning on the curb to this very day",https://genius.com/Watsky-the-legend-of-hardhead-ned-lyrics

One verse and one prayer
For one person who cares (All I need is one)

Going forward’s always been the only place I can hide
With no direction I would speed a hundred miles down the coast
Until I lose the ghost that’s chasing me but never arrive
I know the night’s scary, but we’re alive and the pipe’s cherry
And I’ve got a stack of papers like a library
I’m driving seeking a beacon of light freakishly
All I needed was a speaker that might speak to me
But my CD system is so janky a cone dangles
And it dances on its chord like it’s Bo Jangles
You can work it if you hold it at a low angle
But when the bass hits it grows tangled
Come on right speaker! I’ll take everything you give me
But don’t pity me, there’s people living on a single kidney

You got a bad hip or even a bad temper

Time isn’t a sacred cow
And I’m willing to take it down to the final minute or second,

Going up for a take and I’m itching for action

This nerd'll flex and you won't see this man pout
Cause the traits that got us beat down, are what make us stand out
So let your tongue hang out if you got lips like Mick Jagger
Plant and stand proud with that little kid swagger
The subtle it factor of the baddest individuals
Cause adamant originals don't end up in pigeon holes
Which gets my thinking it's a damn shame dorks
Don't pop their pimples like they're champagne corks
I work the quirks, cause if I didn't start sloppily
I'd never clean up this cotdamn properly

If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
And step into the past (Way back)
I'd do it all again (Again)
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
I was a stupidass (Dumbass)
I'd do it all again (Again)

I never threw like Elway
Or overthrew like El Che
So I moved to LA, to the land of milk and self hate
But one day, I'll strip and then strut buck down the sunset strip as it was a runway
I'm thinking maybe Sunday
And if you need sensei for sexy, just text me. I stay by San Vicente and La Brea where the rent's cheap
So you can't tempt me, with a Beamer, Benz or Bentley
That's complete with penis envy, and even keyless entry
Cause see, I'm making ends meet, so care to be friendly?
And make ends meet? In my backseat in an awkward frenzy
Once in a parking lot while practicing anatomy
I was knocking elbows till the music zapped the battery
And dammit it was bad but I'm not mad I brought my A game
Even if we sat there naked ‘til the man from Triple A came
And it was way lame, but I've got on good authority
She boldly told the sordid story to her whole sorority

If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
And step into the past (Way back)
I'd do it all again (Again)
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
I was a stupidass (Dumbass)
I'd do it all again (Again)

Some days I wake up and I wonder ""what would Buddha do?""
And then I jump into my fruity little Subaru
Some dudes'll front, ""How do you do, Mama?""
Because some women see the mula, and say 'ooh lala'
But I say 'woo-sah'
I don't smooch on muchachas who need mucha to mooch off
I'm cool for like a futon out in Utah
A yurt up in the Yukon
When hurtin' i'll go back to herding wild yaks in Bhutan
Or cop a coupe with coupons
But when you get a 
F.U.P.A.
 
like a dugong
I'll treat you supa dupa we can't do wrong
Cause beauty is a dude who puts the moves on, then moves on
We're all moving as true pawns
And get chewed in the food chain
We're all nude in the new dawn
Brain screwed on
With a plain birthday suit on
So let's graduate human, summa kumbayah, huge honors
So you goners should do the do and do wander the blue yonder
Cause trying to fool the future takes too long

I don't know quite where I'm going, but I'm on my way
I won't look over my shoulder, back at yesterday
I know that I'm getting older, a little bit grey
But I won't turn my face to look

If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
And step into the past (Way back)
I'd do it all again (Again)
If I could go back then (Back then)
If I could go back when (Back when)
I was a stupidass (Dumbass)
I'd do it all again (Again)",https://genius.com/Watsky-stupidass-lyrics
Right Now,All You Can Do,2014.0,"It's '86 when my mama has me
30 seconds later when the doctor slaps me
15 years til I get my permit
And then 4 more til we're in the backseat
Of a taxi, crazy youngfolk
And then sun came up but none woke
It's 4:20 when I made that dumb joke
I was saying something like blah blah blunt smoke
And then it's later in the afternoon
In my backyard when we write this tune
2 days later when I pen the verses
Probably 8 months til you first heard it
So punch the clock, adjust your tie
Spike the punch and touch the sky
Life is hard and then you die
So let's all go hard tonight

Remembering the days that felt so long
I bet you miss me
We spent the whole day dreaming, our minds made up
We're making history
Right now is right now
Too loud to die down
Right now is right now
No other time now

If time is money a second's a penny a minute's buck a couple years are a milly I'm getting really really filthy
Bitch, get me a bathtub!
I'm filthy rich, watching my pennies stack up
I shower in a typhoon
If time is dimes then I'm a tycoon
I'll glue em together and the climb to the moon
Climb to the moon! Climb to the moon!
We on Today, Today, Matt Laur
Every 24 we going like Jack Bauer
Hear the bell ringing I'm thinking it's that hour
Turning on my light and I set it to max power
Let's keep it going and going, I'm talking moment to moment we live the high and the low
And then when we're broken like cracking open a coconut we pull ourselves together again and we gotta go


Pushing offa the ground tonight
I be up in the clouds tonight
Looking over my town tonight
In the shadow we found the light",https://genius.com/Watsky-right-now-lyrics
No Complaints No Conversation,Complaint,2018.0,"There's something wrong with her
There's something wrong with me
I don't think that's so wrong, we came by it honestly
And honestly, I think mostly everybody does
I don't blame you if you need to catch a buzz
I've built so much armor, but ring the alarm
I'm in love with someone who's bringing me harm
I'll pick lovers who got monsters and we bond on mental health
'Til they remind me of what's ugly in myself

But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints

I'm always on the brink
About to fly or sink
A minion with opinions told me that I shouldn't think so hard
That shit just made me think so hard I couldn't sleep a wink
Washed my red flags with my white flags and now all my laundry's pink
I'm petty at best, someone to pity at worst
Putty in beautiful hands, potty mouth ready to curse
Cursed to be curious if all this is a scam
And I had to Google narcissist to check if that's what I am

But other than that
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation
I got no complaints

Either you get nothing
But they make you pay and pay
Or you get it till they take it all away
Every day, every day
It amazes me a hundred brand new faces
But I'm still trying to figure out who they is, shi-
I don't wanna settle one bit
Bet that I'm gonna battle for somebody, but if
I look at what we got and catch rot
Then I'm gonna come in with a hatchet and I cut it down quick
Cut around rust, cut around mold
Everybody ends up cold
Heads gotta roll, that's life
And you gotta be the neck or the knife
But I'm told that I can't quite quit this
Constant itch to matter, my restless drive to win
That's driving me, that drove away the closest of my kin
How I twist away when deep relationships begin
And shit, there's still the b'iness of the thinness of my skin
I'm vain, I'm lame, I'm strange and yet so typical
I make the same mistakes, I don't change shit, and still
My folks age and age, I hate to face facts
And I feel I wear their faces as a mask

But other than that (I wear their faces as a mask)
But other than that
I got no complaints and no conversation

The Girl Next Door (To Everybody Else),Watsky,2009.0,"It's a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else
It's a song is a song about the girl who sings
And every time you hear her sing
She sings for you
And you alone
And every other guy you know
She loves you back
She says she's with it
Loves you back
But wait a minute
All along she loved ya back
Enough to put a dagger in it
It's is a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else

So, funny story
I was really into this girl, a great singer
And I had this musician friend who was really into the same girl
She ended up essentially 
playing us off each other
But, we both had these songs that we were going to do with her
So we just put them together

It's like a fairy tale!
About little chickenhead
Thought the sky was falling
So she kicked it sick and dead
I came calling (she pretended she was dead)
Feeling she was healing but the ceiling fell instead!
You feel stellar in your skeleton?
Tell a guy you fell for him then tell him he's irrelevant?
It's evident you think you're Helen of Troy
But you're hell in a handbasket
Hell of a coy little Cruella Deville
If it's fitting you fill in
Another filthy felony with every fella you thrill
You're cellophane
But there's a spell on us still
A man goes window shopping
And you sell him the sill
You give an illness that isn't a silly pill or some silvery penicillin
Or pity gonna fulfil and so willing my pen is spilling I'm drilling my point until
The pen point's dull
The end point's still
Insight, I'm inside, I'm insisting
You get wise and quit with lip-synching
In Christ, you entice the quick kissing
Rise in a bathtub full of ice with a rib missing (It’s aliiiiiive!)
It's been decided
You can lie, but you can't hide it behind your eyelids
I provided rhymes and had to plan a hybrid
With the man that led this band who might have liked you more than I did
Or maybe as much
Cause baby that's what
Make me want to laugh
Just, breaks me right in half cause
It really adds up
Dwelling on this sad stuff
Celibacy mad sucks
When everybody tapped once
Including a best friend
Then one of my roommates
You said it was just then
But shit it was too late
So what's your group rate
Cause we've been waiting our turn
To watch you eat your words
And catch some heartburn

Guess that's the problem
When you have a bunch of people who are artists
You end up falling in love because they're amazing on stage and it's too bad
Because she really does sing like an angel

Here! is where you would have sung the verse
Here! is where you'd have to catch a breath
Here! is where you might forget the words
Haha that where you'd laugh to fill the rest
Here! is where you'd hit another high note
Here! is where you'd make it pretty, shit if I don't
Here! is where we'd really try to be friends
Funny how the shallow girls end up off the deep end
First I met your ass last year
First day of class, you were mad sincere
Then you went and chose my friend for benefits
Then he did the same and said it was the end of it
Then funny thing, I got up on the TV
Then coincidentally you said you'd like to see me
Then you stood me up on just our second date
Out with mister music
Then you used him for your serenade

It's a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world's next door
They see her- everybody melts
She's the girl next door to everybody else
It's a song is a song about the girl who sings
And every time you hear her sing
She sings for you
And you alone
And every other guy you know
She loves you back
She says she's with it
Loves you back
But wait a minute
All along she loved ya back
Enough to put a dagger in it
It's is a song about the girl the next door
I love the girl next door

Brazilian hair weaves and bazillionaire thieves

Kidnap Your Boyfriend,A New Kind of Sexy,2012.0,"I was just thinking that I really like you
And I was just thinking I really like you
And I was just thinking if I kidnap your boyfriend
Could I be your boyfriend?
Verse 1
I've gotta time it right
I've gotta plan it through
You're a stick of dynamite
Hope that I can handle you
You're a whole new animal they couldn't hold a candle to
So I demand a candid answer, what's a man to do?
Could pay a camera crew
Get an editor set up in his kitchen with the video and kid and put his ass on Catch A Predator
Call his creditor
Tell em he's in heavy debt and with fed on red alert
I plant a care package, a bear trap with the teeth padded
And when he grabs it, then I beat it like Br'er Rabbit
Or I could lock him in the liquor cabinet
Drinking, thinking, sad until he kicks the habit
And if he gets lovey dovey
I'll take a kindergarten keep him in the cubby
When we leave for winter break and someone gets the pet I'm gonna pawn him off on little Betty like he was a guppy

Verse 2
It's a minute to midnight and
That's my cue to pull up in my big white van
Beckon him with my charisma
Chucking snickers at him like it's his Bar mitzvah
And if someone heard that racket
Better bet I'm gonna bag him in a burlap sack
Your dude's whack
He lacks the X Factor
(Bookmark boy) I can be the next chapter
What do I do for the women who tell me they want me?
That when I got over the one who steadily haunts me
If I get over the one
Then I'll be ready to party
Then I'll be looking at Blondie
On me get up and calmly walk away
It's pretty pathetic
I get it, but not today
You wanted to play
You want me to act tough?
Spend every dime
But I won't go bankrupt
I said to be easy
Could you please back up
All these Jenga beezies they just don't stack up


But if I'm too blunt, I can mask it
If time's a blunt, I can pass it
I'd rather pass with the passenger
Shotgun the messenger
Call off the massacre
Your dude is cool
I wish I didn't have to mess with him
To tell the truth
I want the very second best for him
I'm positive I'm not pessimist
I'm not jumping
I'm just pissing off the precipice
If I deafen to the definition and I never getcha
God I betcha I'll be better cause I metcha but be I'm missing always waiting for day you'll be available
You keep on stating who you're dating ain't debatable
But baby, maybe we could pick up when this shit ends
My sixth sense says we're clicking like we're Bic pens
I don't wanna read the writing on the wall if it's only gonna end like Annie Hall",https://genius.com/Watsky-kidnap-your-boyfriend-lyrics
* (’A New Kind of Sexy’ bonus track),A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"“I don’t want to brag, but
I spent so much time at the top
That I got caught for loitering
I insulated my house with swag
And got swag poisoning
The righteous path is like my waist:
Real narrow
I sprint along it, pushing all my swagger
In a wheel barrow
But I’m over swagger
See these poser rappers
Think they’re goblins but they're goobers
So I gobble’em
You battle me, you’re gonna have a white boy problem!
And I guess that I should stop at nothing
Now to rock’em, sock’em, knock’em dead
But I don’t want to waste my breath
I’ve got respect for oxygen
And I don’t want to walk a block in Waka Flocka’s moccasins
The heap of crappy rap online’s colossal
It could topple, I don’t know why I bother to scoff at the debacle
But you’re so awful that I have to LOL and ROFL
You’re a lost dog, I’m a boss hog
And damn svelte
Actually, um, I really need to hold my pants up
And I’d rather use the champ’s belt
Or I’ll just go nudist in my human pelt
I mean, I think it’s super that you’re looking for a tutor
You could use the help
I’m wiser than my age
And so I plagiarize my future self
I’m not ashamed of intelligence
I came to the game with all relevant elements
A liquid flow so solid that I had to gassen’em
I go bananas just to boost my dosage of potassium
To push it to the maximum
To pop my pecs and flex in the excellence
You know I get it
I’d be pissed off too if I got bested
By a thin, self-deprecating, lisping Jew
But what’s-a boy to do?
I mean I only end my pieces so the audience can get closure
I go ham and it’s still kosher
I mean if you’re unsure if my boast or brag is a joke
I’ll try to let you know in subtle ways
My punchlines are lost baggage:
You should get’em in a couple days
But hey, there’s no cypher I won’t jump in
I’m liable to say somethin'
Screw a stand-in, I do all my own stuntin’
No steroids or supplements
Me in the game’s an odd sight, like
Non-white Republicans
Herman Cain’s, Bobby Jindal’s
I can’t explain it so I just
Throw in some Illuminati symbols
Pop these simpletons like pimples
Be very visionary
With a very busy world like Richard Scarry
While your picture’s next to ‘dingleberry’ in the dictionary
I don’t sling rocks, I bling lots
Ask Gringott’s
You should know me
I chucked homes like OE, OD and go cold turkey
I’m the young, clean version of Old Dirty
You’re a toy
You’re a toy that’s slapped together, packed and sold from factories
That’s why it’s easy for me to play whack-a-mole with wack MCs
I’m the common factor linking 2Pac, Babe the Blue Ox, and the Maccabees
In fact I snack on wack MCs like a blue box of mac and cheese.”
(Backing track: Ludacris - 'Go 2 Sleep' starts here)
These baby MCs all look hecka tuckered out
So I tuck 'em in or stick a sucker in these suckers' mouths
I'm like ""bucka bucka bucka"" you can't sit yet
And when you spit up, it's like you learned to spit from dipset
I got a double-barrelled Nerf gun and I'll clap mine
When I go ""brap"" I'm sending rappers to nap time
Sit on my lap, and by reciting your wack rhymes back
I send you to a sleep that's so deep you flat-line
You've got a little tuft of hair but can't afford a wig
Which sucks because your head is disproportionately big
It's a beacon of weakness, I can see it from space
Jesus it's freakish, but you're no baby genius
You're an average baby at best, a dumb baby at worst
I go ""humm baby"" and talk trash when I'm rounding first
These MCs are ticklish. You want a little sip?
You get hungry instead of horny when you see that nipple slip",https://genius.com/Watsky-a-new-kind-of-sexy-bonus-track-lyrics
Hercules,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"I know I'm just as strong as Hercules
Because it's wired in my circuitry
And if I'm just as strong as Hercules
You'll see I'm just as strong as Hercules

In 1638 they came from Sweden
Ship shape settlers late looking for Eden
The Delaware tribe wasn't really keen on leaving
So they ""bought em out"" or slaughtered them quick and got to breeding
1659 they built a fortress
Stationed soldiers, and gave them horses
But now their forces were losing their resources
Moving in the living quick as moving out the corpses
Started changing courses, when we got the Quakers
And they been running town since Cromwell met his maker
They didn't take pay cut, Quakers got their cake up
The paper came triangulating, trading with Jamaica
Now in the 1700s they took care of biz
Built the families through some noble marriages
Still in WiIlmington, doing what their parents did
Living up on 7th street in Mansions they inherited
1800 and in step the du Ponts
Irenee du Pont was fleeing the war in France
He made the jaunt cause apparently murder rate
Was higher for gentle people spitting on the third estate
He started working late, he had grand design
And when we cut a couple fingers off the hands of time
The du Ponts were running under Delaware like panty lines
They built a mill for small explosives on the Brandywine
But gun powder's just as temperamental
As the rich kids with CEO potential
It's essential to compete for our emergencies
Which brings me to a company called Hercules

I hope I'm just as strong as Hercules
I hope I'm just as strong as Hercules
But when it comes to stacking currencies
I'd like to be as strong as Hercules

Hercules Gunpowder started kind of small
DuPont had it all, were sparkling wall to wall
They were ballin' in the fall of 1899
When T.C. du Pont crawled up the Brandywine
Now Thomas Coleman, 
started as a coal man
In the mines in Kentucky with his old man
Joined whole fam, and flipping the strip tease
Went from fig leaves all the way to big cheese
Never got on his knees for the love it won him
From couple of brothers, Lewis and Russell Dunham
They were running shit with Coleman's muscle
Lewis wasn't clueless
But Russell's on his hustle
Now brother Lou, was Coleman's true blue man
T.C. would have an idea and Lou drew plans
DuPont had seventy percent of GDP
When it came to gun powder and TNT
They bought even bought Hercules
""Scandalous!""
Said the government, so brought on anti-trust
Litigation, and they split business up in three
Into Atlas and DuPont, and Hercules
But certainly they were busting heads
Put in work at Hercules, then made Russell prez
In 1912 up the road from Dover
My great great grandfather Russ took over

I know I'm just just as strong as Hercules
I know I'm just just as strong as Hercules
Because It's written in my history
I know I'm just as strong as Hercules

Russell Dunham, we said Daddy D
Or sugar Daddy D to half the family
Ran Hercules as an affable property
Slap on the wrist from capitalist democracy
And so between TC and Papa D
A bit improperly they adopt a monopoly
And instead of dotting the i's and often crossing the T's
They take a walk in the trees, and talk and pocket the cheese
And when Russell dropped to his knees, his heirs cashed out
Every generation after the shares passed down
(So where's that now?) Split between six ladies
And my mother had the stocks till the 1980's
If Stonewall pays my phone calls
If San Juan fills my Scantron
If every molten shower out in Okinawa fueled by smoking powder
Pays my broken power send my folks the flowers
If it's irrelevant to my intelligence
Gimme a shotgun, I'm dropping these pink elephants
I'll take a tranquilizer shot and sell the sedatives
Out in Delaware I'm well aware the fella lives
(And what if Iwo Jima)
All the skeletons in my closet are dead relatives
(And if the Fall of Saigon)
And then I grow up to be another screw up
(And if the Tet Offensive)
But if I blow up
It'll be cause they blew up

My mother loves me more than Hercules
My parents work harder than Hercules
But if I think of this as burglary
I know I'm stronger cause of Hercules",https://genius.com/Watsky-hercules-lyrics
Stand for Something,All You Can Do,2014.0,"Never been the one to play it cool
I never been a fan of fancy shoes
I only want to stand for something
I don’t care if they approve
They don’t know what I’ve been through
I only want to stand for something

What was I thinking when I headed to SoCal?
Everybody gotta order the low-cal or no-cal meal
I don't even enjoy guilt
I think the city turned my semen to soymilk
But I’m a motherfuckin hypocrite
Acting like I never give a shit
But now I think about it maybe a tad bit
Cause pretty baby I be ready to admit
I'm thinking maybe I will never be Brad Pitt
Want the celebrity? You gotta be bat shit
To want to be a piece of meat, we treat em as cold cuts
But go nuts when we see em wiping their own butts
And the crowd goes wild
But we don't smile if you got no style
Gotta be kidding me, giving the pretty people the key to the city
I don't even know

We struttin
Ain't nobody gotta tell us nothing
Because a rose is a rose
 and 
I am what I am
And I wear it like campaign button
I don't want a side eye
I say bye bye
Roll up another one and hand me a Mai tai
Because the people who be running the show
Are kinda like the season how they come and they go
And we'll be living while they looking for parking
And we'll be digging while they woofing and barking
They kicking in the door and hoping to barge in
But this is what you get there's nothing to bargain
If it's a hundred to one and we're under the gun
I'm not gonna be groveling for the governor's pardon
Don't gotta suck in your gut if you want to guzzle a Bud

Fingers twitching like moth wings
Hoping to matter
But he can't see how he matters to you
You can't drink wine or coffee
And you're stuck with a body
That fights each small request you make

I got that brown grass dogs come pee on
Your grass so bright it's neon
Green and tie-dye and grows a mile high
We'll be betrayed by the seeds that we sow
Tiny blades grow and stab the earth from below
Your dying dreams bleeding out in the snow
You with the crumbling hips
She sees strangers eat oranges and clenches her fists
In these miles of highway
You're the prettiest pileup that I've ever glimpsed
I’m lost in the awful withdrawals
Grass seems much greener beyond these old walls
But my worries so small
When I walk through those hospital halls


Tiny prayers you whisper to yourself (3x)",https://genius.com/Watsky-grass-is-greener-lyrics
Color Lines,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"Your first rap show posted in the back row
Of a sea of white kids bent on supermanning that ho
Pretty soon you're buying fitted hats and high tops
Pretending that you're black enough and rapping with the lights off
It's like a cyclops with one closed eye
You can tell me that you're winking, but the grin won't lie
And no mouth supplies, what your skin tone hides
About a thousand miles south as the jim crow flies
And then we're playing he said she said
I see red when I peep a pink cheeked boston meathead
I wanna go Bruce Lee
When I see him on the T taking up two seats
And say, ""excuse me, but would you move if hell froze?""
You know the subway is the underground railroad
Lynch trees have the same white limbs
Check out my arms, I look just like him

Let's you and I get one thing straight
The game never been equal, ain't no food on my plate
I gave birth to this and you just took it and co-opted it and profited
And packaged it and wouldn't give me half of it
Peep how I master this and break down how you took it all
Raped the culture and you standing there looking all
Innocent, take a mile when I give and inch
And how you getting rich, is it a coincidence?
Or is it ignorance? You don't know your own privilege
You own riches and don't know what homeless is
You got a lot to learn before you even think about
Hip hop, black culture and which fitted you pickin out
Play Nigga in the store, I don’t think so bro
My people ain't supportin your black history show
So stop what you doing we won't take it anymore
Before you come in my house wipe ya feet at the door



I see the color lines
It's tough that every other time a brother rhymes
White mothers think of gutter crimes
We keep our standard higher
We don't kick lower rhymes
Other times it undermines the fact the mine are over minds

All you gotta do is get past the guilt
We ain't living in a house that master built
If you overstand that, tell your people what you know
Because one of em got enough money to pay back what you owe

Yes, My great grands had land, had slaves
I guess I pressed this record off the bank he made
But I want independance, past the declaration
But one down ass white boy can't pay for reparations

I'm running out of patience while you do the work of Satan
Like an impulse. 
Edu Leedz Black history's an insult

Number one, I'm not trying to tell your story
I just want to sit on my porch, drink a forty and spit
Number two, cause uou can smell bullshit
I just love hip hop
Pinkie swear that's it

If you love hip hop respect it
That includes the people who created it and paved the way for this
So that you're making it

Well if you're talking on who's making it, I'll play devil's advocate
A lot of black music has white dollars backing it
Kweli's got it on lock
Rupert Murdoch funded Rawkus
You looking for the keys, then you better check the pockets

I'll be checking pockets all right
As soon as it gets dark and all night
I'mma get my money we can all fight

You taking out the high and the mighty
And their kids
You say kill whitey
I say can I live?
You're not black militant
Killing us diligent
Grab my fam, and grandma and light us up like a filament
I thought we were cool
 now I'm this close to giving in

But bottling the feelings’ll make a man bleed
The words leave my mouth in a stampede
Watch em galloping, breaking records for land speed

You're just so Bay,
 I hope you don't say “no way”
Now that I came back around to OK
And if you let me I will love you till we go grey
So be my 
do-ray-me-fa-so-la-ti-do
We'll hit El Farolito, and get a bomb burrito
I try to kill my ego when your subject appears
But I still think of you when I had a couple of beers
I'll see you soon I got no use for a bucket of tears
It seemed unlucky how we'd orbit each other for years
We got our timing right and then I collided with you
The wait is worth it in the moment we finally do

What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue
I'm always coming back to you
Your boo, your boo, your boomerang
I know neither of us have the key
But I'm telling you, you have to see
How you're always coming back to me
My boo, my boo, my boomerang

You press my buttons like I were a Nintendo
Me and her up in a permanent limbo
It's like it’s nothing when we're burnin the indo
The streetlights like a blur in the window
I got no cause to feel I was betrayed
It's just a symptom of the of the game we played
We pull the hearts out of each others' chests, pull the pins out of the hearts
And toss em back and forth like they're grenades
Hot potato, hot potato, what did you do?
Blow my fuckin arm off and then kiss the booboo
Hit me with a shovel, and then say ""I dig you""
And be colder than an igloo
When you want me I don't want you, when I want you, you don't want me
When I sing a tune and you sing it too then it's ""womp womp"" in the wrong key
You always let me go and do my thang
But I'm always coming back again—boomerang

What I told you maybe half was true
I know neither of us have a clue
I'm always coming back to you

Planet Earth, Planet Earth
Watch it spin, watch it spin

And yes, yes, let's let's let’s get some takeout
Press our hearts together like when kids make Barbies make out
Let's make out, no toothpaste
I only want to know how you taste
We don't need to tie no shoelace
And we don't need to pack no suitcase
To, to find a new place. Let our moment linger
We'll weave our hands together and then kiss this braid of fingers
Until the whisper, whisper of time's undying rivers
Come decorate our skin with crow’s feet, spider-veins and fissures
But we won't cry, we won't cry, we'll step into that cyclone
Together when we're blinded and our minds erode like limestone
And all we can remember's how we make each other feel, then…

Why don’t we get high and watch Planet Earth? (x3)

Watch it spin, watch it spin

I know my Poppa loves me
I know the camera loves me
I can tell my brother loves me
I know that Boston loves me
And San Francisco loves me
I love the city back
I just can't help it, it's so lovely

I'm in my lucky underwear, I'm feeling debonair
If it's a lonely trip to heaven, I'm already there
I'm in the bedroom and I'm stepping like I'm Fred Astaire
I make it happen, battle rapping at my Teddy Bear
When I was twelve I'd leave my door open a crack
Afraid of getting busted sneaking porno on my Mac
I guess I was a freak
Until I got caught last week
(who's been loving you?)
I was reading Booker T, I threw the book at me
I go for the lookers but they never look at me
I would get a hooker if I could unhook her bra
I'd be looking soft as soon as she took her top, off
Let's go rolling in a broken Winnebago
Stop and smoke a bowl out of a hollowed out potato
It's hash now, but it's hash browns soon
(who's been loving you?)

I know that Jesus loves me
I know that Buddha loves me
The fucking Easter Bunny
And the ghost of Gandhi love me
I know that Santa loves me
And the ghost of Gandhi love me
I know that Santa loves me
I think my Aunties love me
I know my Grandma loved me
She thought I was handsome trust me

This insanity, that's heredity
It's my family, we can let it be
Wish I pretended that mom and dad are dead to me
But I love my dad, that motherfucker read to me
My first words were ""where's the love?""
Mad smug, assed up on a bearskin rug
Fashodo, my mom'll show you the photo
(who's been loving you?)
I do embarrassing better
I could wear a pink sweater
With a pair of slick pleather pants
Derelicte e-va-ry day and it's well known
That I hop off stage with my cell phone
Fake a dropped call when everybody's near me
And shout ""I love you mom!"" so everybody hears me
I need it too and true nothing new but
(who's been loving you?)

Even though I owe them money
I think it's pretty likely
That my whole family loves me
My lovers tend to like me
I know my homies love me
My teachers loved to hate me
The haters love to fuck with me
The fickle love me lately

I'm a percussionist. I never knew guitar
It's cheesy, but I'm stunting like a superstar
It's easy man I'm hopping out a moving car
Call me Weezy cause I'm coughing at the hookah bar
I don't do cigars, but I got hella game
I can make a lady out of styling gel and cellophane
So you can yell my name, I make the bed frame move
(who's been loving you?)
Me and my better friends are heading to the town strip
If they don't let us in we'll never take round trip
Because I took an hour picking out my outfit
And then I took another slicking down a cowlick
And I like house sitting, but fuck it now's different
I'm going out and there ain't a bouncer for cow tipping
So I'mma tear this joint up
And I'mma party till the hoofs point up

She said the struggle is normal
We act the part, I cracked her heart
Am I still one of the good ones?

You wanna brawl and crawl back into bed
But I can't move at all, I'm stalled and in my head
I'm out here playin' dead, we are not fit to duel

Somehow we find each other even when we're trying to quit
'Cause right behind our shit we like each other quite a bit
But I might admit, it's pitiful the way the line was split
A hundred thousand years and we're still trying to find the clit
But we don't have an ending yet we get to write the script

Dreams and Boxes,Placement,2020.0,"Part I: Dreams
I think I know where all my problems come from (California)
I never really had the guts to look under that log
I need them all, all, all to love me
But they see through me so easy
I wish I could believe in your God
Sounds fun, we could throw rocks out of heaven
I get these dark thoughts every day now
I never thought I'd be that one
Good news, I'm way too scared to do it
And I have too much fun being scared
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
You will have to drag me by the neck
I'm not gonna bail
Writing on the ceiling of the box while the coffin is nailed
California dreamin' while the demons are hot on our tail
Hop a curb, yes, that was me off of the trail, officer
No, I don't have a good reason
I was just in a mood to go seekin'
Heard a hard poem, it had my heart thumpin'
Start my blood pumpin' again
This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
When you fell for the first time
This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
I'm in this for life
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere
I'm in this for life
Drag me by the neck
You want your holy grail
Try not to overthink it
I try but always fail
But I want it so damn bad
I'm addicted to life
If I lived how I thought that you want me to live
I don't think you'd like what you got
If I shot my poetry out of a cannon
Would it make it any better?
If you fill a gun with glitter
What'll become of the bullet
If you're only suffering under a veil?
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
I'm not going anywhere, anywhere
I'm in this for life
Like it or not
You will have to drag me by the neck
This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
When you fell for the first time
This one is for the people who raised me up
It's for the people who raised me up
If you remember one thing, then remember how it felt
Part II: Untitled Spoken Word Poem
I dreamed I understood myself completely
We were having a party in a house falling out of the sky
Every clique showed up
The ones who love the smell of gasoline
The shy beautifuls
The microphone eaters
The gimme gimme gimmes
The maybe next years
The boring childhooders who trashed their lives for fun
The house rotated as it made it through the storm
Eyeball-sized hail sailed sideways through the windows
As the single pane, survived-the-great-fire hundred-year-old glass all smashed
We laughed and dropped the hailstones in our drinks and danced
We started chanting something optimistic that we knew was maybe mostly bullshit
But that if we even still felt one-tenth of one percent how we felt in that moment in the morning
That it would be an energy that could shake neighborhoods from their foundations
We dragged ourselves on a twenty-mile mission to fill our goblets in the kitchen
I got stopped by a hallway goblin named Frank
Who said he once dreamed Karl Marx and Rosa Parks were beating the shit out of him
Which gave him a full-body orgasm
I told him my dad analyzes dreams for a living and believes they're portals to the subconscious
And I believe him and I don't judge you, we're all weirdos
My dad still refuses to drive Beemers because they made cars for Hitler
But I always suspected that that was convenient logic
For a family that could only afford used station wagons
I told him how in a drawer in my house I found a matchbook from my dad's 1955 Bar Mitzvah
It still had nine dry unused matches that hadn't been torn from the cardboard
It's a time machine and remains my second most prized possession
Do you understand this, Frank?
You're in the presence of a motherfucker who owns fire from the past
Can you imagine getting high with a flame from 1955? Can you?
Do you feel connected to your ancestors? Do you?
Do you ever feel strange? Wonder how the world's gaze has shaped you?
Do you fear being shaken by the shoulders like an Etch A Sketch
Being mugged for your memories? I do
They are my first most prized possession
My very first memory was sitting in a high chair with my brother the day the Bay ripped in two
The earthquake shook the china from the shelves and we clapped because we didn't understand
I told him how my mother's father died in a plane crash
I told him how my brother grew up to be a pilot
And then the captain, which apparently the building had and was my brother
Came over the intercom, which apparently the building had
And alerted the party that the house was starting to spin faster
And soon it would be time for us to hit the ground
So either buckle your seatbelts, say your prayers
Or find someone who wants to fuck you
China was smashing against the ceiling
Me and Frank said our goodbyes easily once I realized I'd been having a conversation in the mirror the whole time
I climbed out a window, clung to a drainpipe, and watched the stars paint the sky
Part III: Boxes

(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)
I see the ghosts on every corner
Of the people that we used to be
So many that they sit upon the shoulders of their brothers and their sisters
As our city slips into the sea
Danny in a DC tee gettin' stomped in the head on Clement Street
Kids in the black boots
Dad's got the long hair, Dad's gettin' hired, gettin' fired
Everybody wave (Me in the ambulance!)
Mom's got my pills in a paper bag, bills on the table
That's before they were really real people
And the punks grabbed my bike in the Safeway parking lot
Chased 'em for five blocks, never got it back
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)
We were already fading, we just didn't know it yet
Holdin' onto the lie of my perfection tucked under my arm like a late Blockbuster cassette
And fuck yeah, I was hard for Miss Popular
Been jockin' her but she couldn't see where I sat with binoculars
Binaca stashed in my pocket, shot my good shot, the good Lord, she blocked it
Cherish the small tragedies
The big ones are smokin' out in the bathroom and loiterin' for the moment when nobody sees 'em comin'
An openin' they can jump in and make a total catastrophe
My family tried to hold it together
But now that we can't hold it together
We'll hold each other closer instead
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my elbows, ass, and my knees and toes, I got my)
Little boxes on the hillside
(Elbows, ass, and my knees and toes)
(I got my)
Danny in the deep blue sea getting wasted on the MUNI out to DP
Kids with the tall cans
Dad's got the short hair, Dad's not retired quite yet
Everybody wave (Me in the ambulance!)
Mom plays guitar and she sings to us at night
That was before we were really real people
And the punks grabbed my bike in the Safeway parking lot
Chased 'em for five blocks, never got it back
Little boxes on the hillside
There's a blue one and a yellow one
And they all look just the same",https://genius.com/Watsky-dreams-and-boxes-lyrics

Thank you for the inspiration

My looks wrong, I know I sound odd
But when I hit the mic the first time, I found God
I'm not downtrodden
, 
lack a great bod
, 
and I be looking more like the crowd on Cape Cod
But ever since I pumped up my Reeboks, before ""Fiddy"" and his unit from the G block
I been rhyming in the mirror
, 
blending in, like a diamond in the clear, trying to strut it like a peacock
I taught myself how to beat box
When I was listening to J5 and Pete Rock
2Pac and Chief Rock, you know, that we gotcha
Chillin' like a meat locker, hotter than some sriracha
Sip a bitter memory, and make an ugly face as if its nothing but some cheap vodka
Just some fuckin' mind erasers
But I'm from the bay, and we don't spend a dime on chasers

All I wanted to do is write rhymes
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes
(Huh?) Is that a crime?
(What?) To write rhymes?

I don't be an economist
I don't want to be a cheap novelist
I don't want to be a weed or a botanist
I don't want to be a pimp or bottom bitch
I don't want to be a strip club manager
And I'd hate to be a strip club janitor
Mopping up for crusty ass customer, bustin' their nuts in the cuts
I just wanna bust a verse
I don't wanna be a court jester
I don't want to be a royal poison tester
I don't wanna pick up dog crap for park and rec
And I don't want to be a doghouse architect
I don't want to be a server
I don't want to flip beef burgers
Be a beat maker
A Walmart greeter
A CEO, an astronaut or a fucking sheep herder

All I wanted to do is write rhymes (Oough)
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes (What?)
All I ever wanted to do is write rhymes (Okayyy!)
(Huh?) Is that a crime?
(What?) To write rhymes?

But the sad fact is, most real folks don't get don't get to practice
What we love for a living
We do backflips
And no matter where we're at on the atlas
Earth spins on its axis
It's back to the rat race
We run the hamster wheel at a mad pace
We'll run laps till our last days
Just a beast till the last rose petal drops in the glass case
I'm one of a lucky bunch
But I upchuck my free lunch when sucker punched
I'm fucking up, I don't want to free pass
When my ancestors potatoes rotted in the field they would have to eat grass
And folks put on ski masks
When their back's against the wall throwing right hooks
And I just wanna pen verses, write hooks
Man I'm such lucky asshole
Someone fucking slap me with my rhymebook

All I ever wanted to do
I said, all I ever wanted to do
All I ever wanted to do
Man, all I ever wanted to do",https://genius.com/Watsky-all-i-ever-wanted-lyrics
Waking Hour,Guilty Pleasures,2010.0,"In the waking hour I see your face
In the waking hour I feel your (Oh)
In the waking hour feel my body race
In the waking hour
Baby I see that the game is unspoken so if you play with me
I don't need nothing broken
I've got patience you see
And I don't mean to preach that's it's a man's world baby
But a woman will teach you to believe

You were on the bed in that pretty little thong
With a ribbon on it, when I said to pick a song
You had a feeling for some healing with that Marvin Gaye
Begins with ""let's,"" ends with ""get it on""
I get it. you're ready to fuck
And it's time for me to let it erupt
But. I got a confession to make
When I get nervous
I can never get it up
I gotta get it together, I better meditate
I want to set it straight
I gotta separate the passion I had
From the fear that came
Alone I get a boner when I hear your name
But when I'm near the game, I veer to shame
Clearly, my dear it appears the same
Severely lame!
My genitals' flustered
Make a last stand like general custer!
I'd take a cluster fuck or a just some animal lust
I know you're looking for a man who can thrust
(trust) I was in the sack with a faster women than Danica Patrick
When I had a panic attack
I can never fake it, I make another mistake
And I'm aching and so I pray to the have the pastor take
An erection collection and pass the plate
But no one donated, so I had to masturbate
I know the girls want it
I'm close, and if it grows I can put a condom on it
Her moan is onomatopoetic
I groan. because my bone is gone as soon as get it
Got a risky trick, for frisky chicks
Have a drink, then blame it on whiskey dick
Wait a couple hours, I'll be horny good
And can wake up with a little bit of morningwood

In the waking hour I see your face
In the waking hour I feel your (Oh)
In the waking hour feel my body race

And I don't mean to preach that's it's a man's world baby
But a woman will teach you to believe

I know that many men are waiting
To be penetrating
You think I'm panting
But I'm hyperventilating
I would get to mating but I'm so damn nervous
I called my dick, but I can't get service
The worst is I'm a pervert- I want you
I'd make harness from your tan brassiere
Last night I had a fantasy
We're banging hanging from the ceiling like a chandelier
Slip into your chimney singing ""santa's here!""
But it's a grand veneer
Damn, it's enough to bring a man to tears
With a hand on my gear
But a strand full of blanks in my bandoleer
There are times when I wish it away
There are nights when I wish I was gay
It'd be quicker- I go to theater school
Shit I figure I could stick it to pick of the litter
Man I'm sick of it
Want to stick a dick in it, lick a tit
Get some cliterature, for the illiterate!
Hit it in the middle of the night
In the waking hour
When I take a shower, we can strip
Luckily I studied up on being cuddle buddy
Would rather have sucker who fronts?
Fucking you once, making ugly grunts?
I'll be casanova (in a couple of months)
I'm making you mine
Maybe later for the sake of taking our time
Tonight we can lie naked
If you don't mind waiting
Give it like five dates and I'll have your thighs shaking
I get her in bed and then we're attending a seminar on a bit of sex ed
I hope this song proves
How fast my tongue moves
Cause it's true I give the best head

I go to sleep just to wake up in your arms, babe
And before the dawn you'll rise when the sun say
Early mornings make me restless
Breath on my skin, I'm already breathless (oh)
You're sexy under pressure, boo
Better catch your breath so that I can let my hands perform for you baby
We're all alone, help me untie my blue sarung
I can't wait to tell my girls, ""Yeah, that's my man
So good I had to write him a song""

In the waking hour I see your face
In the waking hour I feel your (Oh)
In the waking hour feel my body race
In the waking hour

So cut your last pair
And put up your black hair in a bun
And come fast, we can run like mascara
You got force like Joan of Arc
And he falls short like Bonaparte
And you deserve greater, I know I'm no savior
But I'm here right now, so let's go
Kinda feels like we've been running every day of our lives
And shattering hearts and havin' ours cracked
But if you went and threw the broken hearts in a pile
And added the stack, then what do you have?
You in the black, deep in the red
If you're in your bed then you should come meet me instead
And out of the misery you know you've got a friend
Said you got me (You got me)
(Can't break you down)

I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Limo for emos, limo for emos)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Anytime, anywhere)
Cry and I'll be right there (Let's go)

They want us movin' at the speed of light but we won't hurry
Let's hit the city and stay out so late that it gets early
Like early on when we were livin' on the cheapest thrills
Because the town we fell in love with has the steepest hills
But those downs rebound to ups
Tried to push dad's coupe and torch the clutch
And they built us with extra gears and our cars run on ex's tears
Last night I realized I'm still sleepin' on my mattress edge
Saving room for someone who's not coming back to bed
But if we meet, I got room here in the shotgun seat
But if you'd rather take the keys, please, I'll put up my feet
We pay taxes, we live frugal
Wear new suits to old friends' funerals
Have true loves until they're false

But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
But when you're down
Cry and I'll be right there

I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (I'll pick you up)
I'll pick you up (Cry and I'll be right there)
(Let's go)

(Let's go)
Limo for emos (Let's go)
Limo for emos (Cry and I'll be right there)
Limo for emos (Let's go)

Limo for emos (Let's go)

Duke Westlake Cypher,UnKnown,UnKnown,"All beef
Oscar Meyer, attitude
Transmogrifier, set to bragging dude
I shot the death star, I'm oh so swaggin'
I'm like Reptar, komodo dragon
And ya'll are Bambis, I'm Samwise Gamgees
Put the game on my back, like it's Frodo Baggins
Holler at your hobbit, fuck your Gollum ways
Follow me to get my ring I'll set it all ablaze
Because I'm saucy, like I'm Hollandaise
But I love rapping, like a grandma at the holidays
I love rapping like most rappers just love dough
They get the Pillsbury like Bill Murray I just flow
And crush the microphone to subatomic quarks and shit
Until it's flung across a bunch of odd coordinates
So if you're talking, put a sock or pop a cork in it
The game is finished man it's over, stick a fork in it
Or have Kavorkian escort it to the morgue
And get it's organs in the fridge and call the stork to fill the orphanage
I'm in the future chilling with my man Neo
While lames are in the past and play with Sanrio
So damn Vevo, I simply bust better
And beat every ninja turtle ever plus shredder
This nerd is blowing up, it's a phenomenon
That you couldn't copy if you kamikazed Comic-con
Ice Cube would say to come and test Compton
But I'm on a rapping bender like I'm Hunter S. Thompson
I'm on a bender, like a tiny gray antenna
Futurama baby but my tiny lame dilemma
Is that my energy is like a shot of five hour
So I guess that technically it makes me WHITE POWER
I devour every doubter I encounter catch a coward and I sit him on the counter
And I fix his little cowlick and I work with him to try to be a
Way less sucky new productive member of society
Cause there's no rivalry
I'm taking a page of the Patriots playbook and making a dynasty
And you could be singing the national anthem as if it's a minor key
I'll give you the win and I promise that I'll even throw in a tune up
I'm doing it moving I'm loving the music I'm looking for truth
I've been rocking a decade and if I get lucky I'll rock it at seventy
If I'm alive I'll be, a fucking sight to see",https://genius.com/Watsky-duke-westlake-cypher-lyrics
V for Virgin,Def Poetry Jam,UnKnown,"This is for those among us who got enough play though 12th grade to carry in an upside down teaspoon
For every kid who could have counted their high school hookups on two hands tied behind their back
For every kid the collective romantic prowess of Steve Urkel, Al Gore, Richard Simmons, Bill Gates and Screech from Saved by the Bell
This is the anthem for those among us who got none in our formative years
And this poem is for every high school Virgin who wouldn't have had it any other way
You don't know the possibilities of a weekend until you'v cracked a six pack of Juice Squeeze with your boys, bumped B.I.G's Big Poppa and watched an entire Star Trek: The next generation marathon
For me, Virgin was working
And I can see why Trekkies greet each other by throwing up the letter V
Live long and prosper
It's time to reclaim the high school virgin as sexy
I am talking damn that's some sexy peach fuzz sexy
Picked last for kickball sexy
He's so sexy his homework, the laundry and the dishes do themselves around him sexy
I am talking cowlick, house arrest, sweatervest sexy
bedrest, Led Zep air guitar sexy
Pen Pal, study group, buddy system, teddy bear hand-me-downs sweatpants Corduroy sexy
And yes, I am also talking check out the curves on that parabola sexy
But mostly this is regular kid sexy
Brown paper bag, unpopular for the right reasons, what a nice guy sexy
Spends Fridays doing nothing with his friends sexy
Screw your football team sexy
I am talking Big Fat V on my lettermans jacket
Cause I am varsity sexy
So hold your head high in the struggle have pride in the struggle
I can't rock your world, but damn can I cuddle
Girl I wanna lay you down by the fire with a bowl of popcorn and watch Fresh Prince reruns
This is for every kid who couldn't get it, didn't want to get it, or had it and gave it back
So throw your Vs in the ayer if you're a true player
And wave em side to side like you just don't cayer
And for everyone here who was ever a virgin
And for everyone here who's ever loved themself for who they are
Keep your arm towards the sky
And understand that at least one dorky white boy from the 415 knows it's the sexiest arm he's seen in his entire sexy life",https://genius.com/Watsky-v-for-virgin-annotated
My First Stalker,All You Can Do,2014.0,"She freaked when she saw me
Calmly eating my tamale
She followed me home from the diner
Now all day she be on me
On the other side of the street
You can see her through the blinds if you peek
With a book propped up on her knees and the blue hair
What do you care when I'm home what I do there?
You're creeping out my neighbors
When they grab the paper
You probably think I'm inside
Like some kind of savior
Solving world hunger
Working on Sudoku
And filling in the numbers
Polishing my halo
Ooh I bet you wonder
Life can be bogus
We all wanna be noticed
But we're the ones in the background fuzzy
When the ones in the front are in focus
And it's pretty difficult in general
When you really think a person is incredible
And I get it why you're setting em up on a pillar
But the bigger the tumble the bigger the pedestal
Frankly I am flattered
We all want to matter
Do you see when you pass by
That we let the grass die?
I'm late with the rent check
We park on the lawn
Like we're a bunch of fuckin rednecks
I'm just watching Netflix
Jerking off to porno
(I have a subscription!)
And I got a suspicion
You think my life is different
I get your confusion
But you got some delusions
Yeah I'm fucking awesome

Amazing Grace,A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"I used to think I was a Marxist
Now I go to less marches
It's not that I don't want to start shit
But I don't want to start shit
Unless it's where my heart sits
I don't keep a knife under my seat
To join the revolution and spill blood in the street
Rather have a discussion over a bottle of Bud
Or a puff on a blunt and then get something to eat
I used to ask strangers if they believed in a God
To see if we were peas in a pod
And if they didn't agree with me
Then I'd argue and try to be smarter
Thinking I'd hear people applaud
But I'm getting older
And I'm getting dumber
Or least I know less
Than I did when I was younger
I used to profess
Now I'm more pro-wonder
I used to fear death
Now I'm set to go under
No, fuck it, I still fear
This life is too top-tier
And it's like we just got here
We're more than an Uzi on a navy plane
Or Lazy Susan cruising on the gravy train
We're the tingle up your neck
When you see the sunset
Filter through the dust
As it settles on the Waves of Grain
Yes, the Waves of Grain on the stolen land
Theft is as American as a Cola can
Yeah, it was sold to Sam
Tell it to the mother of the little girl
On the trail of tears as she holds her hand
Damn it, this was built on something ugly
But with all my heart, man, I believe in this country
The beauty of our constitution
Have you read it lately?
I swear, it's really pretty lovely
It's really splendid
It's like our forefathers penned it
Inspired by some early Eminem shit
It's like they meant it
It's like they dreamt
That all the fences that divide us would eventually be mended-
Or rather torn down
So I don't think it's un-American at all
For us to ask for even more now
Let's talk it over, over more rounds...

Hey that's the city
Traffic's always shitty
If you can't kick it happily then dammit that's a pity
You don't even have to be some hackie-sacking hippie
For you to be relaxed and free like Janet Jackson's titty
So wave your freak flag
If they don't like it they're a D-bag
They deserve a tea-bag
If they want to be mad
You could give ‘em knee pads
Tell them to S on your D or your V (vag!)
Maybe daddy was mean
Or they got the tiniest penis
Or the hater gene
And you ended up in between it
And it seems that they're a little bit insecure
So they want you to feel smaller than an insect, sure sucks

And they wish I'd been aborted (wait, what?)

Stuff that I
Put into the public eye
I used to wonder why
So many people would say that I'm gay and I should just give up and die
Now I shove my pride
And all of that stuff aside, see
Most of these haters that be commenting on YouTube
They respond with anger cause it's something that they're used to
Something in their childhood that left them with a loose screw
In their cabezas
We don't choose who raise us
No patience is given for the way that you're livin'
So I just made a decision
To say I forgive 'em
And give 'em a chance to make it in this unfavorable system
Before they do something crazy and shit in the name of religion
You sayin' you Christian but hate someone who's different than you
Ask yourself what the leader of your religion would do
Now roll up on a hater with some out-stretched arms
It ain't gonna do nobody no harm

Take whatever is heavy and hold steady

Working on letting it go
Looking for heaven above
Living in heaven below
Listen, I know that we're getting bigger
I figure the clock is ticking, but if I'm digging and digging
And hitting nothing but rock I'll be stopping until I'm useful
I know that soon it'll become a possibility
We're not gonna be meeting till we're at another funeral
Had an epiphany, I know you're not my enemy
And if I'm thinking different the distance'll be the death of me
Destiny hasn't ever been part of my life philosophy
But I believe in opening every window you find
If your window's missing, you draw a frame on the side of the wall
With a silver Sharpie and then you open it wide
If it doesn't open, at least you know that you tried
And what can you do but try?
Maybe you and I were never meant to be tight
But say that we were to live for a ten-century life
You could always change your mind

Hand Over Hand,All You Can Do,2014.0,"It's the American dream
But if you pull on the thread, it's gonna tear at the seam
See what I mean? We don't tend to scream
Baby, we just stare at the screen
Like it's a preacherman up at the pulpit
Some with the scars end up holding the bullwhip
Another angry kid unloading a full clip
And I could tie a pretty bow on this bullshit
But let's not lie for another second
We see the trouble, we're rubberneckin
No doublecheckin, if it's an issue we have to grapple
The words are caught in my Adam's apple
I make my body a happy chapel
Cause every person's a tabernacle
But there's no feeling you gotta hide
So let's all pray to the God inside, say it now

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It’s that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it’s hand over hand
Love over everything

That’s me with the long arm
Screaming at the top dog, spilling my blood on the cement
We willing to roll now, sick of getting mowed down
Fuck if I dope now, it’d kill me
Cause I’d rather be known for the dealing
Than known to be hooked on the feeling
How many more gotta go now? How many more gotta go down?
I’ll stand in the rain witcha, just to get a little bit of glimpse of the plain picture
People need a pinch just to get em to wake up
You’ll be in a ditch before I get you to wake up, say it bruh
Whoever said it wasn’t fair, they was telling the truth
I’d be a liar if I said there was nothing to prove

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?
Still I wish I could break free
It’s that same old simple song I still believe
How many more do we need?
Before it’s hand over hand
Love over everything

They say we gotta know our role
Kiss the bottom of the totem pole
Set goals, and then go for gold
But we hibernate and hide inside our gopher holes
I wanna smoke a bowl, a hand on my dick
While the other one is busy clicking the remote control
I'm no Dalai Lama of the sofa but I hear I gotta go to
Where the sinners face the roasting coals
You say that your heart ain't got no holes, well bitch please
Let's all admit that we got souls like Swiss cheese
But wishing isn't gonna fill this abyss
And no hand over hand over fisted riches is fixin what's missin
If I wanna kill this monotony
I know the answer is a light that I got in me
I got no university degree in philosophy
But I know that every baby's born with the lock and key

Never needed a hand til you needed a hand
You never know how to walk until you understand
Coulda been anything that you needed to be
How many more do you want? How many more do you need?

Drunk Text Message to God,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I’m not trying to brag or anything but I’m going to tell you about my night last night
Had a couple beers, ya know
Yeah, got a little tipsy
Got a little existential crisis-y
Last night I drunk text messaged God
I just wanted to tell him I’d been thinkin’ about him
A lot
And to tell him I’m stalking a church
I meant to write starting a church
No one spells drunk texts right, anyway
Last night I sent out a buttload of embarrassing texts and then copied them to everyone I know
Like “Yo”
Like “Sup”
I was out sinning
Curled in a bed
The room is spinning
It’s all in my head
I can’t get to sleep
And the weight of the world
Is the weight of my sheets
Here’s the great thing about my church:
You can keep your religion ‘cause my church is for those of us who grew up wishing we believed in an afterlife
And for those of us who were so close to god we could practically lean over and make out with her
My church is sick of bloody crusades to the march of drum corps
I’ll start a church that gets pissed off and starts thumb wars
Maybe a church that gets Mondays off for religion reasons
A church that throws phone parties in elevators to learn about praise
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We’ll dance as it burns for 8 magical days
That was a Jewish reference
No offense to Gideon bibles but my church goes into hotel rooms and fills up the drawers with chocolate pillow mints
And my church, if you choose to come to Sunday school, you don’t learn about hell
Hell no
You eat Jon Stewart and Steven Colbert shaped potato chips and watch Chapelle’s show
My church had 10 commandments, 5 precepts, and a workplace abuse handbook but we partied hard last week and I think we left them in a restroom at Chuckie Cheese
Now we just go by a picture of a heart that I found on a bar napkin
My church tongue-kissed your mom last night
Um, I’m just kidding
She left 5 red fingers across my face
We hung out with the creator
I think she loves you
She’s beautiful
She’s got ‘daughter’ tattooed on her left bicep
‘Son’ on her right
My church is at the center of the planet and has the most amazing stained-glass windows
The glass is the floor of the ocean
The colors are where you look up and see blue and a manatee
I love manatees
And the forest canopy
Tony Montana comes to my church and forgets he left his cocaine in the car
We play “Stairway to Heaven” on Hendrix’s broken guitar
My church gets fucked up on communion wine
Asks lamp posts to be our Valentine
My church bar hops together
And my church, if you don’t blow yourself to smitherines, you get 17 virgins in a room to yourself
Or you go and play Starfox together
My church got beat up by the skateboard kids for being a rollerblade kid
But rolled to school the next day on one skate and 2 crutches
True to the fight
With a fist in the air
Screaming “fruit Buddhas unite!”
My church can feel it’s pulse in it’s fingertips
Has 3 stomachs because our fear is hard to swallow
But love always has room
My church has a love bladder and always asks to go to the bathroom
There are drawbacks of course:
My church will not resurrect your dead hamster
My church will not play for keeps
Wear Versace
Give out baby Jesus Tomagachi’s
And Tom Cruise thinks my church sucks balls
I’m not Jesus Christ
But I can turn water into Kool-Aid
And I’m not Jim Jones
But my church is like, totally a cult
And everyone drinks the Kool-Aid
And everyone dies!
But for some people the Kool-Aid doesn’t kick in until you’re 105
Surrounded by everyone who matters most to you
Yes, some of us go early, but at my church you have to think about that possibility
‘Cause my church makes you scared
I’m talkin’ like waves of fear
Like you’re lying awake at night
And you pull the blankets up to your neck
And your covers are like a tsunami of fear
And you start hyperventilating
Thinking about how you’re getting older way faster than your dreams are getting accomplished
About how skinny your arms are
About how fat your tummy is
About how much it’s gonna suck to eventually lose the power to think about all the badass stuff we do at our church
Don’t fall asleep yet
Contrary to popular belief, that’s not where dreams get accomplished
The body of Christ is your body
The body of Buddha be your body
Your body be usable
Your body be suitable
Your body beautiful
You don’t need anything different
Keep your broken cell phones
Don’t delete your text messages
You might read those stupid-ass,
Badly spelled rants over on a Sunday morning...
And have a religious experience.",https://genius.com/Watsky-drunk-text-message-to-god-annotated

I ain't scared, you can bring that danger

All we do is win win win
And then draw some
Because I fight with my friends, and my friends like to win and they're awesome

Well then you crossed me
And you better watch out
Cause if you watch me
You know I fight to the last for my fam and my friends are my fam so a friend is a Watsky

Oy vey. man I'm colder than the South Pole
I don't give a damn if it's a no-shoes household

It's how I pull off looking like a Boy Scout, yet
I'm rocking sneakers that are cleaner than a moist towelette
And yes, my rider calls for Grey Goose and Applejacks
How I rose so fast from the cabbage patch
I use some four letter curses, and then I drop a triple word score that'll scrape you in a Scrabble match

Here comes lover lover, on some other ish
Quick to blow up like a pufferfish
The toughest puppet with
Purple plush stitched in my flesh
Snuffaluffagus up in this bitch
On some raw rubber ducky shit
And you muggles mean mugging
Better cut it quick
Chuck another diss, and then pucker lips
Kiss my voluptuous hips
And then button it
Stopping fuckery's on my bucket list
I like monsters under beds, But I'm a kitties and puppies man
Slap that peppermint frap from a yuppie's hand
Didn't clean my room. I puff the magic dragon
So go ahead and stuff me in the paddy wagon
You dilly-dallied while I called shots

I won't brag, but believe me, I know swag
I'm feeling so sav
My friends in the backseat follow our police chase live
On the plasma screen headrest TVs that I don't have
They warn me about the spike strips
I swerve, and I fly through the 'burbs, but then I hit the curb
And my tire pops; I flee on foot, but get tired, stop
And invite the the firefighters and the night-cops out to IHOP
This is the life, homie, why knock it? I get high fives
When I pop the top off my beer bottle with my eye socket
I'll be fine
I'm bleeding but the best beer-goggles is to be blind
""Ahem. Is this seat taken?"" Is that you, British fool?
I can't see shit, but know there's a seat vacant
""It's me."" Well sit down, dude, there's mad room
We just got food, but there's bound to be round two",https://genius.com/Watsky-there-and-back-again-lyrics
Watsky Raps Even Faster,UnKnown,2011.0,"I love all cats, even copycats
Dr. Seuss cats and their floppy hats
I love bob cats, I love tom cats
And your mom cats, even wombats
Love a fruitbat, hate a combat
Love a comerade, hate a Comast bill

I don't wanna battle if you really want to fight then you can
Fire at will
Lets just play pirates till
Legit we're scally wags
Hit me in the leg and put a peg in it instead
And then I bet that it'll benefit my cali swag
Hey wheres my rally rag?
Maybe my fanny pack
Winning winning winning every inning every round
When I'm down, I'm going to hit like Manny Pacquiao
Im' running laps, now do jumping jacks
Celebrate our friendship in a slumber party
Killing in a pillow fight and with my Rumble pack
I don't hit punching bags, I pick the pumpkin patch
Who's the little pisher so ambitious
That hes bigger than his britches
And has got two thumbs attached
O hai this guy right here
Credit to Reddit
You bet ill never forget im forever indebted
And Ellen for getting the cougars to check it
It's too good to take and so I'm gonna go
Dry my tears
Gonna meet up at a 7 eleven
To pick up a dank doughnut pack
I look at myself in the glass and go, ""Oh what""
Taking a bit of a nap
Then I'm waking up for snack time
Making our way to the back of the line
Cause we don't cut
Never get up at the crack of dawn if I can help it
Wanna be able to tag along when sun is setting
Gotta be open to having a long and healthy session
Taking the love I got and try to spread it
Why would I want a pet if I couldn't even pet it?

I don't know why I'd want any lame pet, me and my pet and are winning
It's game set match
I worship Biggie, Pharoahe, Eminem
And Busta Bust and Mr. fade to black
But could I be the best ever rap threat?
Of course not silly rabbit
Billions of people and we haven't heard any animals rap yet",https://genius.com/Watsky-watsky-raps-even-faster-lyrics
Fight! Fight! Fight!,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"Spun a web of lies, took notes from Charlotte
Throw a red herring,
 
paint the White House scarlet
Pennsylvania Ave
 
was the last red carpet
Then Bush relapsed like a rehab starlet
I feel carsick
Stop the Paris Hilton carousel
Hot as hell and smells like kerosene and caramel
America's flaring and we're carrying parasols
Paranoid of terror cells,
 parents scared of aerosols
Said if you care at all, fight for the ones who fall
Fight for the ones who can't, fight for the one for the all
And fight for the ones who rep,
 
and fight for the one percent
At the bottom against the one-two-one-two step for the ones who come correct
I don't wanna sit back with a Big Mac and a rack of natty ice
Six pack on my lap, skinemax on blast, sticking to the facts of life (Right)
Said if you're taller better follow who you're steppin' on
Cause I'll be brawling like the fightin' Irish leprechaun

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Since I was little I’ve been fiddling with the riddle
Focus like folks addicted to Ritalin craftin' it with no chisel
You soft as Malcolm in the Middle
I’m strong as the Nation of Islam with Malcolm in the Middle
Uh Izza, Uh Izza, can you save them
Playful like skittles or that little minstrel delicious was kissing like a switch
Switch it up like a schizo
Pretty motherfucker would get ugly like Gizmo
It’s okay maybe it’s not your day
I’m a winner couldn’t even get beat by Dr. Dre
I couldn’t even get beat if I was your slave (Yay)
I got 
My designer clothes look like 
Angry like sin case thoughts once his chains unlocked
And this is why I’m hot
But not in that M.I.M.S sort of way
More like you better get him sort of way
Cause until I kill Bill he won’t put his sword away
Been a professor like you got your tenure today
Got my vendetta to settle I ain’t settlin' for close
When it comes to wantin' change I’m as unsettled as Mos
Spittin' live from the boondocks
With my boombox
Sittin' on my soap box
Spittin' got my folks locked
They patiently waiting for me to give em' some of freedom fighter
Kind like Huey Freeman of 21

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

I don't need a chart to see that I look hard to me
There's no Chardonay pumping through my arteries
And my heart’ll say I should take the harder way
If I got a part to play, I won’t make it Bartleby
At least this Starter T is feeling like an armor piece
It's guarding me like it’s righteous artistry
So far to lead us to 
inagaddadavida
To seeking god in your freedom
To God I gotta lead a vida bonita
Cause see to lead a beautiful life
Is more than eating, sleeping, and meeting suitable wife
You gotta fight
While luda’s throwing bows in A-town
I’ll be throwing blows like little children on the playground
You should know the bay, we're seeming sorta tame
But we can go insane
And if you’re on lower plane
 like when a boeing lands
My fist detaches at the wrist, so I’ll be throwing hands

Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out

COVID Relief Freestyle,UnKnown,2020.0,"Oh shit, I guess we're starting
The mic is where my heart is
I know what my part is
I hear my own voice
I make my own choice
I guess, we're fuckin' doing it
The horse is out the gates
It's time to start the race
Shoutout to Kathy Bates and also Betty White
All the people, if you're the type
I wanna say that you're equal on the mic
But nobody's equal to me
Nobody is coming for my neck
I am looking for respect
I'm not looking for a check
Unless it is for my friends
That's why we're doing this
To make some pennies
And maybe make amends
Sailors in the sea might get the bends
That is my fuckin' dream
To go with James Cameron in a submarine
To the bottom of the ocean
Rocking forth with the motion
Me and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion
Sharing our emotion
Daring you to fuck with us
At the sea, at a deep water vent
But we don't got the bends, we're not bent
I think that's what I'm meant to do
Me and my crew
Gigantic, looking to cross the sea
For the Titanic
Oh shit, you mean they found it?
Already? They'd abounded with treasure?
Man, that doesn't give me pleasure
I don't know how to measure
How I feel about that shit
But that won't make me quit
In my quest, to scour the deep sea
Like, you and me?
Searching for an angle, mangled
The corpse in the Bermuda Triangle
Maybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane
We're like ""oh, shit, what remains""
And
Then we get to the bottom
Amelia Earhart's like ""oh, shit, got em!""
You didn't know, but I was an immortal
I just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal
Shuffled off my fucking mortal coil
Mortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil
All my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal
And you know, I am not gonna take a foil
To my head in a little tin cap shape
Because you know I'm great
I popped the grape
But I'm not on some conspiracies
I'm just trying to see what's up in the seas
I believe that I will not cease and desist
You cannot resist
When I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist
I am in Manila, in Hong Kong
In San Francisco, doing a disco
Pop it hot like it's Crisco
But I gotta pace myself
If we're gonna raise this wealth
That's why I flow at this tempo
Hello, I do kempo
In my mind, that's a form of martial arts
But I take, partial starts
And I just gave little partial farts
When I'm shitting on the mic
'Cause you know I got this heart
And you know I got the K-Mart
State-of-the-art mind
But I'm not be-hind
No, I'm way out in the front
Rolling up a 30-foot blunt
And you know I'm not gonna bunt
In a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger
Because I am the rap ringer
I never make the wrong call
And you know, chicks dig the long ball!
I am like (Ah)
They are like (Wow)
Watsky, you cannot stop me
I got no paparazzi
I'm a fucking doorstep
I'm gonna take one more step
And then, take another
Word, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'
Here I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada
Just keep rappin', yada yada yada
Hey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld
Me and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld
Or maybe it's more like Larry David
Because you know we're not playing
Shoutout to the Jews, the chosen people
You know that you cannot fuckin' lose
But also, shoutout to the Christians
Shoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions
You know you cannot stop it
Also, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith
Who know we're gonna make way
For the Jehovah's Witnesses
They got their hit list-esses
Walking up to the different fuckin' doors
Saying ""Would you like to love God a little more?""
But it kinda sucks, just because of COVID
They can't be making no bids
I heard they're not doing that door-knockin'
But, you know, we're not stoppin'
However you appraise 'em
No, we are fuckin' raising
On the mic I'm fuckin' blazing
If the sun is blazing
I turn into a raisin
I'm bringing this whole craze
For almost two whole days
I don't think that's possible
I don't think that's wise
I don't think that's probable
That is what they say when they look in to my eyes
My momma was afraid for me
She busted in like the maître d
She said ""Hello umm""
I don't think you wanna sit here
I don't think you wanna get here
'Cause you might die
You know but then I was like ""I gotta try""
I gotta try to do the right thing
Shoutout to Spike Lee
I'm gonna try to get the ring
Try to get the bling
Try to be the king of the long raps
Like I was the dude with the ass raps
Doesn't matter
As long as the people fuckin' clap
As long as we give a little joy
Give em dat'
Then I will cut the crap
I guess I am a believer
And I don't care that I got seizures
I got my fuckin' pills
I'm gonna take 'em right around midnight
So I can get right
I think that's what I gotta do
Shout out to the medical commun-
Itty I just get gritty
I hope my rhymes are not shitty
Umm, mic check are you with me?
Shout-out Bobby and Whitney
But not shout out to the bad things he did
I don't know if I'm gonna have a kid
I don't know if I'm gonna raise a child
But it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild
They would make be fuckin' smile
They got fuckin' bile and some guts
Everybody does
Everybody got guts
Everybody got nuts
Or half the people maybe like 48.7%
That's about how it went
I think that is the percentage-ish
Of the gender fuckin' separation
Although we know in this nation
Things are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient
If you don't understand
I got my fuckin' rhymes on demand
I can run it back
But I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness
If I'm trying to fuckin' win this
I will not get winded, I have not rescinded
Anything that I've fucking said
By the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead
I'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds
That is like Right Said Fred
You just gotta relax
If you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe
I don't get lyrical cataracts
So I can see clearly, so I can be dearly
Received, I've got to achieve
Whatever I've got up my sleeve
Whatever I've got in my pouch
Shoutout to pouch, ouch
I pricked my finger, that is not true
But on this mic I will linger for you
And for my crew
This is what I've got to do
I've got to drop it hot for you
'Cause this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm not
Shoutout to Mims
Shoutout to Hims
That's that brand of underwear
That I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway
I'm drivin' down the one way
I'm cruisin' up the runway
Spreading my wings
Like I am a Cessna
Like I am a chestnut
Roastin' on an open fire, bing!
Crosby, you got me
Me, hot see?
Me Watsky
See?
Sittin' in the hot seat
No, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat
But that word, beats droppin' me
And meha coppin'
Shoutout to Frank Macoppin
Playground
In the fuckin' San Francisco SFC
Because you know how this go
We are the best in Dolores Park
We have a chorus singin' in the dark
Hark, the angel
Shoutout to Chuck Rangel
Rangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but
In December maybe I will be dismembered
By a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa
Comin' down my chimney
Wavin' fuckin' butcher knives
That’d be fucking crazy
Who is he
Who is this robotic crazy Santa
Oh my ‘lanta
I can’t believe that he’s tryna get me
Instead of giving me presents
I can't believe that he got me on the ground
But I'm like ""no I'm Watsky""
And Santa said ""oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude""
But I'm like ""that's rude
Santa you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'
Plus I was in the nude
He got me tackled on the ground
My fuckin' whole brood around me
And I got my whole butt out
He's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away
Cut-out
Cut it out like on Full House
John Stamos
John Stains-Most in his pants
But that's okay
We don't judge people who like to dance away the day
If they need a Pepto-Bismol
My throat is not abysmal
This all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt
I will not repent
And I’m not demented
But I meant it
When I sent it
From my brain
I'm not plain
Im not fuckin' around
I’m not cluckin' the ground
Just right there it’s only two feet
That’s pretty cool man I eat
From that cup right there
The one that’s floatin' up in the air
It’s got a fuckin' strawber-
-ry smoothie
I flow very smoothly
But you cannot do me
Do me, do me like that
I got that roomie type rap
It’s mad philosophical
I just keep on droppin' all
Of the marbles in my brain
They’re comin' out my nose
And then they just remain
On the ground
Even the cat’s eye
That is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by
Did you know at places
People on the internet watch marble races
I watched one
It was mad fun
I picked the fuckin' blue marble
And my pick wasn't all garbled
It came down the shoot
It was going all fuckin' cool
And then it fuckin scooted past the red one
That kid from The Shining like Red-Rum
Meaning murder
Worder
Wordier
All my flows are so dirtier
Than you could even fuckin' guess
I'm not even fucking stressed
I'm so damn relaxy
Shout out to a Maxi-Pad
For being so absorbent
That's a good fuckin' fuction
My girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it
Put her hands in the air
Maxi Pads doing what they do down there
If you are shaved or if you've got hair
It doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare
Do what you wanna
Word to your mama
Your dude can't tell you what you gotta do
Gotta do what you wanna
Make your own choice
With your body or your voice
If you are moist
I know some people don't like that word
Palabra
But you know you gotta like what you like
There was this one time this dude named Ike
Ran to be Prez
And he fuckin' won
Eisenhower, that's what I said
I's a power-rapper
Yes I am
So fuckin' dapper
The clapper
Doesn't work on the lights on this green screen
Man, that would be a dream scene
If I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want
What I want, damn
That would be no scam
I don't eat no Spam
That's 'cause I am a soft boy
And I only eat Bok-Choy
'Cause I'm a little veggie human
And that's what I be doin'
Let me clarify
Like clarified butter
Again, word to your mother
And also not to digress
But I gotta get it off of my chest
Word to Mark Wahlberg
Word to ballers
Wait, okay, let me make my main point
As I rap over this joint
And that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy
I also eat soy
I also as a Jewish type dude not a goy
Get lots of joy out of eatin' carrots
Out of eatin' broccoli
Out of eatin' lots of trees
Out of smokin' lots of trees
That is true
That is not
I don't smoke a lot
But I do when I party
But during COVID, I party hardly
And I guess that's kinda sad
But I've had some calls with my dad
Paul Watsky
And Claire Watsky
It's rare, stop me
It's not, lots of Sundays
I call my parentals
And I just steal out my fuckin' mentals
But I don't pull out my dentals
I go sometimes I do in a dream
When I am on the scene
And the ghost come and make me scream
It's like you are doing the most
And I gotta fuckin' boast
Shout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast
That is some shit if you take a gander
That was said by Mr. Ned Flanders
Mr. Homer Simpson
I'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on
They're like “Watsky, I'll do everything for you
I'll white knight for you and your fucking crew”
I'm like “Dude, don't be a simp
Actually, DO be a simp
You could be pimp
You could be wimp
You could fucking walk with a limp
You can have a crimp in your dimp-le”
I just get the whole tent pole
Up in the sky cause I meant
Lots of people can come in
Cause I got a big tent
So if you are a lame
Fucking get bent
And by lame, what I mean in this game
Is the type of person who says that you're lame
Is the type of person who judges
Is the type of person who never budges
When they get stubborn
Cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard
 00:18:04
Word!
I think I got this whole thing turn-ed up
But that is bound to happen
34 hours when you keep on rappin'
Some words are going to collide like trains
Coming head to head, but it remains
To be seen that I get back on the track
With the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*
With my fucking clapping gums
So don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb
Sometimes
Cause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes
But it happens and I think that is the lesson
That you cannot achieve perfection
And it's not even a worthy goal
You just gotta try to put that ball in the hole
More times than not
This is why I'm hot, as I said
But, you know Man's Not Hot?
Although the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am
'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham
On the microphone-o oh no
Can't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno
Ice skatin' all over the beat
Makin' it repeat
I do not want to beat my meat, on the camera
That would be a bad fuckin' PR move
When I'm all up in the groove with my meat out
They would be like ""oh, shout out
That will ruin my career
Is that fuckin' clear?
Showin' his whole rear?
He got fuckin' nakey
Make me, take me
You cannot bake me
In my EZ bake oven
No Sara Lee
I just keep on flowing, so merrily
Verily, forsooth, did he do that shit
Oh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it
He's just Frank Coppin it
And there is no halting' it
I just put some fuckin malt in it
Make it like some Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo!
Did you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed
'Cause you could not rhyme
Like I do, do the crime and you know that I'm
Just puttin' lime on top of this shit
And that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me
'Cause you know when I put it on top
That I am going to make it drop
To the bottom of the urinal
You're all in my brain


They got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate
Verbally, vocally, stoking the fire
Of the couress I retired
I feel one year
'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear
See how I could sing, that took many years
Before I try to do with the din
And now I only rapped
And now I only try to cap, no cap
I just try to get that back
That back, uh, back
And I'm gone
Over the fence
No shout out to my pens
You know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda

I'm sittin' on the veranda
Just sippin' on my water
Lookin' at my ink blotter
Feelin' like the best
Starin' at my roar shark test
And it's tellin' me some dark crap
It's tellin' some star type of stuff
Like oh shit, I'm gruff
I'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff
Scruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois
6-0-6-5-2 that I'm
(00:44:22)
You know that a bat kills
Using sonar
Going through the cave
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
In the sense of my evil
I'm like Evel Knievel
I can jump over three mics
With my tiny little bike
I am gettin' funky
Did you see that video yesterday with the monkey
On the motorbike
That pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike
It was really scary
I didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me
To, but I said that that video was too weird
A monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly
A weird type of simian
Type of chimpanzee, I don't know which one
It was, it was in Jakarta, I think?
I don't know what type of the rink
Of this world that I skate
I repeat that I'm late
To the party
But that means that partly I gotta go hardy
Hardly, not like Tom Hardy
I don't like smarties
This is a smoothie by the way, I'm hardly
Eating nothing, I say
I say, good sir
Would you like to duel?
I'll trade you a mule
I'll trade you a tool
I'm going to school
Going to university
Facing adversity
You're seein' the worst in me
I am not burstin' the
Seams, like memes
I'm eating ice creams
I'm chasing my dreams
I'm just tryna seem like a normal dude
But I'm not chilly like Hormal, rude
I am in the can
You know it is not a stamp
What we're doing is real, no fake news
I cannot make you
I cannot take you
Being so far away
I just plant the seed like a caraway
Like a fucking sesame
I want to give you more besame's
More besame
You though?
Besame mucho, when this is all over
(00:46:52)

(00:48:16)
Space Jam 2, fucking Pawnstars
(00:48:19)
What do you feel

Man, will it get real?
(00:50:53)
Squidward you had one job
Flipping them burger patties
Rollin' those damn fatties
I wonder what you think
If you try to blink
Man you can just imagine
That you were underground with an fat one
I mean under the ocean rollin' up
Tryin' to light a blunt in the ocean
I don't think that it would light, what emotion
Do you think if you think of Spongebob
Rollin' up under the ground in a pineapple
Under the sea, that is quite snapple  of me
To tell you exactly, you see?
I smell you, I feel you, E-40
Would say that to me if it was not so portly
If he was not better
Oh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40
And I was not on purpose
Lord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this
It just came out of my mouth then it felt the rudest
Even though he's a hero compared to Ham Amazero
I am like Chalamet to De Niro
Dinero, oh shit, shout out to the kid Nero
And Deezus, they are like verbally Jesus
With lots of great writing, Josh fuckin' Gondol, man
Writing that shit, man, you know he's beyond the man
Remember that movie Joanna, man?
I don't think that it was very good
I think that it was sorta weak
But you know that a type of wood is cherry or tea
And yes, I can speak, I'm a freak
Of the week and my beak
Just keeps flappin' and I keep rappin'
I wonder when the beat change will happen
What I keep snappin'
My fingers, I linger
I bring her a pain
I bring this game
To a whole new level
I use a tool like a bevel
Holla without, I am not a devil
I am not a bowl evil
Shout out to all people
All creative people
But not all have the same struggle
You know life's a thugga
War, some people got more
And that is the weird shit
The way that we're living
We don't wanna give in
To the system we were born in
And I hate to horn in
With my own damn opinions
But I don't think rackin' pinions
Steering is the best, man, I'm clearin' out my chest
Now I gotta give you what I think
I don't think you should wear mink
But I think everybody should wear pink
I think everybody should stay hydrated and take a drink
I think that fucking Joel Santana
Cameron were ahead of their time
Damn, thinking purple

Six ones so I can have big fun
I'm gonna ball on the wall
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
I'm a fan
And you all know
And you all go at your own damn speed
It's kinda odd
That I'm flowing the dude who loves all this poetery
Not odd
But his name is girad
Whatever he has I'm sure it's a great bod
And up on the scene in between
I wanna shout out sierra steen
And be so adroit
To remember to shout out alex niece from detroit
A type of weed is harissa or is that a type of spice
Either way I wanna shout out Alyssa and she's really nice
Coughs
Shit I grab this water
I keep on flowin hotter
Hide your wives and your daughters
That’s an og meme man
Inkblotter
I can say a whole mouthful
And that’s me
And I gotta give a shout out to ali
And I'm like goddamn
I give a shoul out to autograph man
And like I gave a shout out to
I just wanna amble
Over to there I don't take a gamble
These are the rarest rhymes I ever spit
This is the rarest three I ever hit

Driving down the court in jorts

All the way to the finish
Shout out to Norwegians and the Finnish
Shout out to dudes who are skittish
And also fucking prudish

Shout out to 
I'm like a guppy
Swimming around in his tank
Not a puppy
You cannot stop me
But you see that Watsky has got what it takes
To not pump the brakes
He is not gonna ever
Sever the ties that he's got
He's no Severus Snape
The cleverest ape on the mic
And you know that he likes
And you know that he loves
To do what he can
He's no toucan sam
He leads with his nose but he gives no damn
And he is goin' ham
He has got the slam
Weed, I see that
Fuckin' Jeff has got the vinyls
'Cause I was runnin' out of shit to this, say
Time to get some things to feed my brain
Now he's got the fuckin' vinyls and they will remain on the table
I think I have got to take a little piss break
Shout out to Mugatu from Zoolander
The hammer falls more American 
I am not needy
My mind's not the bearest

Shout out to John Chenner's greatest tits
How do you say his name? I don't really know

This is the family library of great music
I keep flowin'
In part because I am inspired by Beethoven
Hello, Nash
That's what Jeff says, man, I got no 
That would be bad, man, I'd fall
Just scratchin' myself, man, but now I stall
I'm talkin' no jive
Just shoutin' out Pablo live

A taxidermied Iguana XD
This is the coolest gift that I have ever gotten

Now I'm just walking as you hear me talking
Hour Two (1:00:00-1:59:59)
If I was on Facebook then I would poke
Every single one of you, but it's nothing romantic
Shout out to Pacific, to Atlantic
And even the Baltic and the Mediterranean
And I am just an alien
When I'm makin' these rhymes
And I'm feelin' so fine
But it is no crime
And I don't get slime
New beat, turn it up a bit
Let me hear it, I'm just fuckin' with it
And I know that now up on this beat

Keep on living, keep on thriving
On this mic I am surviving
Actually, maybe turn it down at here
'Cause you know I care but
If I rap too loud
I think my voice will go horse
I think my voice will go donkey
I think my voice will go mule
I was just rappin' 'bout high rule
That was the dual wear fuckin' link live that

He is on the yankees
And I gotta say this frankly
I really miss baseball
And mix all the troubles melt away
But we don't have it on Saturdays
Or Sundays or Mondays or Wednesdays or Tues'
But we just pay our dues
Keep on rockin', keep on rappin' for our crews
Keep on doin' what we can for our friends
'Cause they're gonna be the ones in the end
To hold our hand when everything else melts away
When it all goes dark
You gotta all go back to the people from the ones that you knew at the start
I got a lot of great beats comin'
Goin' and drummin'
From my folks
Crackin' like some yokes
You know that I hope

The best that I ever saw

No, we don't do that today
Okay, ouch, ouch, it's the shoutouts
That I gotta give to the Beatrice Teer
So everybody knows that if you wanna go
Get a shoutout, is this too on the nose?
You gotta go to watskyrelief dot com
Where you can drop those financial bombs
Pay us some owns, pays us some respects
And at the ten dollar level you get what's next
That is for meet up, say your name on the stream
 start
Never flippin' the bird
Never droppin' a turd
Never gettin' so scurred
That my vision is blurred
Just to keep goin
Just to keep hoping
Just to keep ropin
All of these cattle
Doing this battle
Good against evil
Never gonna leave
Never gonna be
A dude named Steve
I'm never gonna change the name
I'm gonna change the game
You think you can stop me but you can't
I'm outta control like an ant


Hour Three (2:00:00-2:59:59)
I wonder, I've got this doubt
To my girlfriend I'll shout
Amber, do you think I'm saying ""fuck"" too much on the stream? I'm saying ""fuckin'"" a lot
Did that make 'em scream?
That's cool, say it fuckin' more
Oh curl, oh curl, like Cardi B
I put glow hardly into this dark night, man, I'm saying
Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, man, I'm sprayin'
Man, over this concrete
On this fucking dope beat
Oh shit, this is ham
Pin me in, this is the one I begin
To flow easily
This flow is so easy, see
No Eazy-E
You are all pleasing me
It's no
 start
Is the place that I rap
My throat sounds like I got strap
I got a limp in my step
But I don't ever dip
And I don't wear a slip
I gotta keep it up at the same clip
I woke up with a headache
But I still felt pretty relaxed
I knew in a couple hours
 start
Because he was pouring sweat
A whole bunch of pictures
People thought he looked really bad
Looked really sweaty
They didn't elect him
Because he had
A real bad demeanor
And betweener
All of us
That's just politucs
What do we got next?
What's a history lesson in which the people can be blessed?
Looks like a big battleship
I'm not rattled if
That's what you think
I hope you don't blink
I don't know what this is all about
A hairdresser, man, I'm callin' out
And we're the confessor
All upon my dresser
I will not pester you
And I will not tester
There's some boobies in this pic
That's cool, free the nipple, man, that's real slick
Honestly, the male nipple and the female nipple
I don't really get the difference, man, is it that simple?
Why is one obscene?
Why is one unclean?
I guess that's just what we could talk to think
That stinks
This is a dude clean, fucking clear net
I wonder who is it yet
He's in Paris
That's very romantic
They're across the Atlantic
Oh shit, this is the grassy knoll
That's the picture that I hold
That's the day JFK got popped
In its open top car he was shot
When he rolled up in Dallas
And a shooter on the hill has such malice
And he shot him and he died
That was really sad, I know my mom cried
She was in shock 'cause a little child
Man, for the whole nation that must've been wild
And there's RFK
No wait, that's wrong
You know I don't play, that's his son
RFK is here
Kennedy's son is here, man, saluting near to his father
This is the Pope
I think that's right
Gettin' harder, it's dope
Oh that's wrong, it's Irish play ride John OKC
Get all these facts right, man, you can't make me
Being wrong, that's my emo
On this mic I just spit more emo
Will I stop? I just say heck no
Yeah, here is the Pope
I guess that's just the coincidence he was on the next page, that's dope
I'm not at the end of my rope
At my rope I'm at the beginning
On the path to winning
Here's the cover about Uranus
Here's a dude swinging his kids
Around with his arms
I think that's good parenting
I think you gotta let kids do their own harm
And make their own mistakes
Man, you can't treat them a kid, glubs
That would not be great
Not at my best
But that's cool off my chest
Off my mind, can't expect to be perfect
Who just gotta keep it
Moon event, you gotta have, make it
Go, you gotta take it so slow
If you're gonna cross the finish line
If you're gonna get in time
Oh shit, it's the Fab 4
Yeah, The Beatles, that's more incredible
Than you could believe
Look at John Lennon with his crazy fuckin' sleeves
His military shirt, is that Audrey Hepburn?
I think that is, man, I'm no half stepper
What I think that was, the jacket from that campaign
You can't tell me that that's lame
So iconic
Wow, it's demonic
Harry Belafonte? That's incredible
Man, practically edible
Damn, I don't know
Woodstock, should be Hetrix
Who knows? You could blow
Wow, there's a lot of top list stuff in this book
I think that's great, man, that's not rough, look
I would show you if I wouldn't get flagged by YouTube
I'm on my sauce like shoyu, so sauce and you know that
This looks like million
A heart, I could heal one
 start
I have just begun
And I have not yet won
I have not yet stopped
I have not yet ceased
And I am not creased
I am not diseased
I am not leavin'
I have no bee sting on my head
I am just beasting until I'm dead
I make them see red
I have not been bled
Thank you 
Of all my hope
You know I just go and vote with my mind
I also vote absentee
Yeah, actually
I'm still a voter in the San Francisco 415
Prolly will be 'til the day I die
'Cause my mom is up on local politics
You know I gotta want it
You know I gotta put it straight
I got this bee in my bonnet
Me? I am not going to just stop
And drop
And stop-drop-and-roll
That’s what they teach you to do
When you’re on fire to hold
I’m on fire, I’m old
I break the fuckin’ mold
I only spit gold
I only spit cold
Again, I have not been Rick Rolled
Let’s see what the scrabble dictionary got
I hope it’s got some words that’re hot
To put up in my pot
So I can stir them 'til I'm not
Dead
This word is Amboli

The next word is jeep
All these fuckin' words, man
I toss 'em in a heap
I'm not allowed to sleep
I would not make a peep
If the sandman came and sprinkled sand dust
In my eye
I would be like
""What the fuck, guy?""
Why'd you sprinkle sleep dust in my eye
That is going to make me stay awake
Man, I try
To go to sleep but this
Goddamn jackass sprinkling sleep dust in my face, man
That is really messed up
It’s the whackest
That does not make me feel jolly
I like Buddy Holly
From Weezer AND the dude

Houston, do we have a problem?

So if a pigeon flies up to me outside
I be like ""Man, your wings are how wide?""
And be like ""Aw, not as wide as a condor.""
But if you like me, you can take a gander
Out in gondor with the rings
Where they have the legend and the three kings
Man, I'm still beasting
The next word is kaiser
I am releasing all of my tension
I cannot mention
The next word is Kame
And Kamela, and Kain
The next word is Kanji

I don't know if the next one was the worst one
The next word is Kappa
Y'all remember PaRappa the Rapper?
Dude was cool, he had a beanie kinda like mine
And he had some tight rhymes
Was he a dog or a rat?
I don't remember what animal that dude had
In his genome
Y'all wanna see me home
I just keep goin' and goin' and goin'
Don't quit it
I just hit it this rhythm

Get uptop, as high as I can go at the pace that I flow ... Like a horse...

You could put me out the stud

They are not makers of dreams
I see that these are going in reverse order to me
Well, this crazy
Hour Six (5:00:00-5:59:59)
The first Disney Channel movie if you were not lazy
And you were fuckin' alive in 1983
You know Tiger Town would've been on your screen
Next in '84, I say
The movie from Disney was Love Leads the Way
And I don't wanna fight
But in '97 Disney made The Northern Lights
And then oh crap
My friend was in this mummy movie on the raps
1997, heaven
You see me in the 7/11
I wanna tell you, I wanna smell you
I wanna fuckin' call 'em and ask for more volume
On the monitor
That would be really great, that would be the thermometer
 start
You just wanna make me on
I think these names are too hard to pronounce
So I'm gonna put them just out
But I appreciate it
That was a good idea
That's quite clear when I'm rappin' this fear
I gotta look and it near
For one I see, weird
All in this together
I think I'll lean back and then I'll just weather
A bit of this beat like this
As it repeats
Until I have to go piss again
Man, when I piss again
I think I could fill up all of Lake Michigan
Or maybe only Lake Erie
But that'll be when you beer me
I could fill up all the Great Lakes
That would be a great tape
I'll set six fuckin' records in one
That would be some great fun
I think that you make one
And the two and then you just try to drum
On your chest like the drummer boy
I just come 'cause the dumbest Doy
Dude is not the rude
Person who stuck a finger in my eye with the toot
I come to the beat
To the rescue and then I just repeat
I won't miscue
I will miss you
I need no tissue
That's not the issue
If you wanna tell me
What to do you got the ring like the Belford human tolls
I'm tryna come bold
With no 
And the bigger the hole
The more that I'm likely to sink it in
I sink it in like the teeth when I'm gettin' the slim
Lead like I am tiger on the green
From the T to the green, man, I'm in
And everywhere in between
I barely hit the fair way
But I can parlay what I need to
'Cause it's not related
When I rack these beats I'm see-through
And my intentions
Did I mention? That were trying to go
For so god... long
That we'll sing a song
That cannot be wrong
I'm here just to rock
But I cannot talk
I cannot stop
Until my jaws locked
Like I've got the mumps
The fuckin' beat bumps
So move your damn rumps
Move your damn
 end
Hour Seven (6:00:00-6:59:59)
6:04
Am I going to hell? I say that will be swell, just keep the contium bc that's what I am doing um. Doing these treats...I rip this mic I still like I am...
Silence is not what I'm going to have like a lamb
...
You cannot burst me like a water balloon I've been so damn thirsty
...
 start
The beat gets fatter
And I just pitter
Patter, keep on going
And keep on rhyming and flowing
I'm in the zone
I'm not knowing
What time zone I am in
I am slim
I am set to begin
I'm wi-nning
Just by showing up at the door
Raisin my fuckin' hand
Asking for fuckin' more
Servings
Of ass-kickings
Yes, sir, I'll have another
I'm masking my fuckin' fear of
Not knowing my brother but that's okay
Everybody gotta go their own way
You gotta do what you can and love who you love
And your choices are your own choices, no-one above
Cool, thank you, okay, great
Thanks for giving this to me
Gotta set it straight
So, this is alphabetical order
This is every name from the beginning
Okay, I’m - not no hoarder -
But, after this, can we maybe start again, new, fresh?
That’s great
Okay, yes, now I’m going to do this
Bless all of you
You are unruly
Shout out to my crew
Now all these names
Shout out to Jeff
Everybody say hi, he is the best
Hour Eight (7:00:00-7:59:59)
Amber’s doing her thing
Showing so much love
I feel so great, man
No bugs
So, okay, on
To these Beatrice prompts
Starting from the beginning

Shouting out to Aqua Pineapples
I’m not going to Yuma

Shout out to A Cat Named Nugget

My energy is not really spent
I feel so elegant
My energy's not really spent yet
I got some more in the tank
Fish name is Hank
Feeling fine like candy
Remember when Mandy Moore did her version on that song?
Sure, I don't know, yo, pass the bong
I'm alluring
I am luring a fish straight of its mooring
You wish that you were on the dock
But I clock all of your protests
But I am not going to go test you
Everything I do is not grotesque
You take a mis-cue, cause you know that I miss you
Silicon Valley is where my alley is
San Francisco, but like the tech biz
What the heck is this, all this shiz?
All the companies, non-profitable
But is there really a fucking future here?
I don't man, it's not quite clear
But I'll steer clear of investing in the next best thing
'Cause my money will go out my pockets like rockets
Fly out with a quickness
My fitness is wild
Man, check out my style, my smile
Oh my God -- his dimples -- it's great!
It's the best person ever
Do I sound like Donald Trump yet? Wait
An eternity to pass before you're burning me
This whole class that I know is fucking your degree
Man, don't give me the third degree
My buttocks are so curve-ery, you could not carve it out
Buttocks was the word they left me, so no doubt
I am nonchalant
I keep on going, I just hit the Bron
Are these words coming from the chat?
Wow, that's so cool, crap
You are the selector
I think I am next, or maybe I'm not
Maybe I was next, and now I am the past next
I no flex, it's a surprise coming up blind to your eyes
Shout out to Cool Guys
Shout out to the dual I have arranged with you
In the next morning, meet with your whole crew
10 paces, then turn, then burn our eyes
We smolder as we get older
The bullet travels, it unravels
The space time continuum
It’s like the Matrix, I'm bending over, man
I'm done
Why did I get into this duel with a random fan idk man i got know idea
I'm going ham
I'm on the doorstep of time
I feel your cold fingers on mine
Oh shit that was the grinch
Oh shit, did I flinch?
I have no wish list but to
Inch myself away from death
You know that I got no fucking stress
I'm a replica of myself
I'm just catsing for my help
Feeling like Reptar
Feeling like a rap star
Know when I can rap bars
As I fucking rep hard
Rep hard for the Bay
For the city I gotta save
It's the 415
You come from there, you thrive
And you're feeling alive
But I can't drive up there 'cause I'm stuck here
But I love LA it's been my city for 10 years
I just know where my roots grow
Shout out to Juno
And the planet Pluto
And my boy Budo
And the dude Buddha
You know you could follow him if you really wanna
Maybe even reach nirvana
Reach nirvana with your momma
I don't know
Comma
Like a flow
I don't have much of a beard
This much is quite clear
But I got a couple hairs on my chin
And that's all I really need to win
And I got this little funky soul patch
If I cut it off, will it grow back?
Yeah, probably, but not more
I think I got more on my cheeks
I've grown them for weeks but its uneven
I've got more on one side, it reeks
It sucks more on my left
It’s uneven hair, man, I’m distressed
But that’s okay
Our flaws is what makes us who we are
They’re what make me a superstar
In my own mind, Vaseline
I’m on the scene, I am a queen
Feeling erratic
Give me no static
Shout out to your granny
I wonder if your granny won a grammy
If so, could she hand me that grammy?
I fucking think so
I fucking pimp the mic and I reload
I just take a heat load
Like I am in the oven
Covered in stuffing
I'm like why didn't you put the stuffing inside?
I don't know, it's not for me to decide
They don't let me cook at Thanksgiving
They don't want my gross vegetarian givings
Maybe someone will eat one serving
But nobody wants them, man
It's hurting my soul
One time I made soup
It was dope and swole
One time I made risotto, oh no
I quintoupled the fucking recipe
But no one wanted my cooking, it was the best of me
That's sad
Anyway, we'll go to sleep now
You know I cannot fucking sleep now
I be how I be always, understand
That in these hallways of my mind
My mind is so rubbery
My girlfriend said cover me
And you can discover me
Do you know about topiary
I am so necessary
I cut it like a fancy shrub
Fucking welcome to the club
Gotta give you a clue
You know what I can do
I'm gonna burn it eternal
My cat’s name was Nermal
No, no wait that was Garfield
I'm out in a far field
My mind's feeling far-fetched
You know I have not quit yet
Now I'm feeling vapid
I'm not flowing rapid
You know I just can't hit this joint
And then spit it candid
Or spit in treaties like Candide 
I'm on a horse, this man-steed is so dope
That I got my voice, and I know that I got my choice
And it's stupendous
Tremendous flow, when I bend this dough
For the needs of my friends and the needs of y'all
I just get this all of my chest
My chest is throbbing like Batman and Robin
But I will not be robbing
I will not be lobbing softballs all over the plate
If I ever get to interview a politician - wait
I'm looking for a loophole
I'm just trying 
Get it, too swole
Scolded, scalded, man, you know
Gotta keep it simple
On a lake as I ripple
Feeling my nipple
Flowing to the tempo
Never let this end, no
I'm a real rice bloke
I will not choke
I don't do coke
Well, I did a couple times
I didn't like it
I thought I kinda had to try it
But it wasn't for me and I stopped
Two times - three times? Man, I dropped
Some acid, though, out in Venice
At the Biennale with my dentist
That was fucking cool, man
That was better than some school, man
I furrow my brow vexingly
No witches are hexxing me
I do it to the nth degree
I do it so specially
Cardiac is my speciality
You got no space balls
I could just make all
Of your dreams come true
Give you a harpoon
And a damn balloon
To pop I'm in the navigator
With an alligator
They say ""See you later""
They say ""Meet me later at the pie spot""
Grab some pie and some coffee
All these people get off me
It’s just me, Watsky
But you know that I'm not gonna be pulled
To your dimensions and ambitions
Did I mention that occasionally I get anxiety?
I have no real piety
I don’t know why it’s me in this body, but it is
So I try to be
An okay type of dude in my daily life
In my daily doings, and maybe I
Succeed from time to time and
Do good from rhyme to rhyme
But I am keenly aware that when you see me, you stare
'Cause you're like ""He looks like some dude who might make me cum
Just by looking."" Oh, are you booking me with your eyes?
Are you cucking me? Why are you doing that?
You could rap about yourself in a strange day
Maybe you do every damn day
If so, you should send me the link
And when I’m not rapping for 33 hours straight
I think I’d try to watch you
If you sneeze, I would say “Achoo”
If you fucking fall, I gotchu
I try to get you up with my trust fall
I try to fucking say “Fuck all my doubts
All the dark thoughts”
I try to danish those harlots
I’m out at a used car lot
Singing some dope harmonics
SInging some harmonies
The devil can't be harming me
I got this great fantasy
That I'm on the faculty at my old school
But the school is in high rule
I’m not quite squeamish
I’m just on the scene, shit
Munching and munching
On this flow, I just jump in
All my hair is really bunchin’
And I’m eating my luncheon
Snap back on this velcro
They all say say ""Hell no""
I all say “Elmo:
But I know my elbow is really close
But you still can't bite it
That's a Russian proverb
You know I won't hide it
I won't hide it on my timeline
You know that I'm fine
I'm not dying on the vine
But I need to remind you
To rewind this like the time lapse
I might collapse
I might collate myself into notes
And then go late into that deep dark night
But not gently, man, I won't go
They meant me to go so fiercely
You know you can't pierce me
With your arrows and your slings
You know you can't bring me down
When you see this crown, I will not be drowned
Do it all for pocket change
Do it all and remain
I see some words from the chat
Thank you, man, I heard that
I think I'll get - woah, these are lots of words --
Maybe not, you know that you make me hot
Under the collar, holler for a dollar
Was that Honey Boo Boo? I don't know
You do the math
Who do you think you are?
I came so far
Words from the chat: cucumber
Up my butt, that makes me not slumber
Rip me in half, that would make me laugh
I am not better than John Cena
I no go bigger -- Cena, Mena
Pause, makes me pause, I can’t get ya
I am the supreme, dream team
You know that I mean on the scene
Play a small violin, hell no
I play a small cello
I just grate this cheese
But that was unsubstantiated
I don't know if I did or not
Shout out to Itero 
Shout out ot Jonah Hill
I'm like ""Yo it's real""
I won't ostracize anyone with weird eyes
Fucking Asian  orange, what rhymes with orange?
You know what rhymes with orange? George
Kind of, it's a slant rhyme
But I gotta dance, I'm happy
What’s hydrophobic? Afraid of water?
You know you go quick into dissing me
Are you saying that water on my lips has been missing me?
Sticking me in the back with these kind of sideways disses
I don't know, man
Water gets kisses from my lips
I'll fucking kiss this straw, and I get this raw
When I get this H2O, me and my duo - partner
Start your car, but you know I'm not a starter
I am not harder than whatever's inside your Larter
You got some hard tack, our crack at this is you know
Rio with the hard pack 
Fucking Mazel Tov
I could knock your nozzle off
Like matzo ball soup
I'm just saying ""Whoop whoop!""
Shout out to Deadpool
I think it really rules
I'm ridonkuous
I drive a Tonka truck
In an increment, it's like sink or swim
I am not a fisherman
But then I just begin
I'm really wildin' all over the place
I need a Tylenol
This is drastic
What the fuck is endoplasmic?
Oof, gotta boof my strawberry smoothie
Up my damn coof
I don't know -- for a booboo hole
What could be that rhymes with coof
Stick in the opposite of my body’s roof
That was rude
Oh shit, man, damnnit
He just wove a damn vocal tapestry
Just clappin' the mic
And do it so laughably
You know I stay on ya
My words in layers like some lasagna
I'm no Flanagan
Irishman doing damn shenanigans
Actually, man, I'm like quarter Irish
On my mom's side, but I just get Eilish
Billie Eilish on the mic, really stylish
Man, I'm batting my eyelids
I play the etude, no attitude
And then I play the prelude
Out of order, I make my own rules
Got a camcorder, it's so cool
I play that mandala
But you know I swallow all of my pride
Popeye is all in my eye
In my grill, eating his goddamn spinach
Why you like that shit so much man, what is this?
I am hella bae
Hella bae'd out, as clear as cellophane
What the hell remains after that shit out on Anza 
Aguirre, a whole damn bonanza
Hear me, I live out on Cabrillo 
I scrub like a brillo pad
It's the texture of my hair
And my next flow is recipe
Y'all really got the best of me
All the quality ingredients
You know that you see me slip
I’m like a bonsai tree. I grow so slow
That I’m on my back, I barely move
When I flow, I am like a kind of lizard
Maybe, I don’t know, which kind -
A baby fucking kimodo?
Do they go slow or do they go real fast?
Ask someone else, I don’t know, I fucking pass
I’m so fucking pure
All my references are so fucking obscure
They're like, ""Damn, you suck more than a fucking vacuum""
That's not true, I fucking thank you
For reminding me that time is now
To do what I do, I'm quite down
You, though, are out there like Pluto
I don't take caloric readings into account
But I am just prehistoric, on some mesozoic era shit
I am very Land Before Time, man, it’s very quipped
Well equipped, like Littlefoot or Petrie
Man I will not razzle you, I'm not dazzled
I don't embezzle funds from these funds, I won't take a dollar
Not a red cent, I won't holler
Man, fuck this breeze comin' through on my knees
I'm Chuck E. Cheese
I got this piranha flow, I got the jump off. man
So Geronimo!
Man, I'm on the way down
But they can't take my crown
With these verbal ballistics, I need these statistics
The elephant in the squad
Is not relevant, man, that's odd
I just rhyme frequently
And I do it with indecency
But I got respect from all where my peers intersect
But I connect with yo on my goddamn Rolodex
Not in my Rolls Royce
I have just got no choice
I'm a cuck
That's not true, try my luck
That's the first thing that I said when the cuck card popped up
I don't watch my girlfriend fuck others
That would be kind of strange for our relationship, ayeee
Don't wanna play that way
It's okay if you do, but that not my thang thang
I brang brang rhymes and I try to sang sang
Get some more protein, you know that I mean
What I seen, I am not a dinkle leaf 
Little type of periwinkle
That was a very poorly constructed rhyme
But you know, fuck, I can find sometimes
I'm behind my mind in my mouth ways
You know I go gray 
I just get all in, I am just fallin'
Sometimes I say ""Fuck it,""
I got a little whack nugget of rhymes
And then I put it to the side
And then I just rewind my mind
And get these rhymes so hectic
When the morning becomes eclectic
Shout out to KCRW
Support your local stations, it won't trouble you
Getting so mega
Buying a ham, bacon, cheese at a bodega
I just gotta say I don't know how to play
The next word in the pile
It really makes me spile
But repugnant is not an easy word to rhyme
So I put it at the top of the rhyme and I'm fine
And I'll need some caffeine in a couple hours
When I'm on the damn scene, but for now
I'm fucking good as hell
Unscrewing my mind, man, you can tell
That is coming off like a relief cap that I just had to doff
I hope you don't scoff if I just seem soft
I feel animated, I feel that I made it -- oh shit!
What we got now? Kush Mody, throwing it down
Can I get just a bit more volume?
I am just callin' em
It feels good to fucking flow the Mody beat
Maybe a little more even? Just a fucking smiggen
I am not a stool pigeon -- that's awesome
Shout out to the DJ, replay
Everything you said, man, I'll relay
All inside of my head
Minding my own business until I am fucking dead
Man, remember Kush Mody, out in Boston
We got lost in the sauce and we did it
Man, we knew each other so long
I can’t even believe that we been so strong
And with Jackson out in the winter
We were like Master Splinter
You remember, we were doing it
We were making that music shit
I'm so proud and glad at how far we've come
And how far we had to run
I'm flipping like an acrobat on the beat
Can you fucking handle that? I will repeat this
It's about connectivity
This is nativity
It's like the young Christ giving me strength
I don't think twice, I just go back
I'm a player, but I don't crush a lot
I just wanna hit the beat a lot
I fucking got to repeat you, I'm useful
But you know that I am full
I'm not just reactive
I'm radioactive
But I am that kid
And I take it back quick
The next word is adultery
Fucking plucked like upholstery 
The beat keeps on thumpin'
Kush mody on the beat keep on bumpin'
The hour gettin' ungodly
Will I keep on going
Probably
I don't wanna create a fiasco
Just because of my wack flow
I wanna keep on goin'
I wanna keep on rowin'

But I never stop hittin’ it
I’m just trying to pick a bit
This is my distribution
I’m just trying to hit this bullshit
Feelin’ fucking mystical
Like I said
I will hit the wall
I might need a thermometer
If you just have to monitor
How hot my flows are heating up
I’ve got to fucking tell you
I am speeding up
But that shit is not something i can maintain
Because my brain if fucking mush
Records I won’t falsify
I am just calling my

Great

Shoutout to Snow White

I am always blasting
The beat on the stereo
Oh shit
Watsky
Look man
Here we go
He's rocking the mic
He's not stopping to hike up his jeans
Or his shorts
Or his shirt
He doesn't have time for that
Man he hurts
This mic
Is the only thing that he hurts
That he's not a fucking pacifist
Against and again I ask the mic
If he believes he is just hurt
????
Bu that was something we tried to fucking prove
But I am not a hoodlum
I keep dropping these good
Um
Flows
Some get stuck in my esophagus
Thats where its just stoppin’ it
Feelin’ good tho
A few hours ago
It felt like I might not flow
Like my throat was getting real kinda shitty
But then it got better
Why you stay with me
Feelin’ so witty

She's hounding
She's got that rhyme caviar

You
Willing to take top billing
To fucking build me up and sign cor ranfycking building
Because I am not a homeowner
And that is not great
But don't all our states change with the COVID
Man some people having no kids
Because this changed our whole worlds
No little boys or girls
And maybe wait a bit
Or don't
I don't know
That's your life
Do whatever you want with your time
Because our lives are so bountiful
And we gotta just power through
Live and thank ourselves and our lucky stars
Or wonder where the fuck we are
In the universe
This is so true it hurts
But I'm not a salesman
I'm more a drink and an ale man
Bringing the truth like a mailman
Feeling like a maniac
Flowing like a brainiac
Because you know that the way I rap
Is so goddamn loquacious
That I'm saying it's gracious
When I'm on the mic I say shit
But otherwise I might not like to say
But I can’t just put this damn mic away
I'm in my cubby hole
Hiding out
'Cause you know that my buddy's roll
It's a scout
If the teacher is coming
Playin' hide-go-seek and you know that I'm drummin'
On a melody
Tell me
Fucking Makaveli
Do you smell me
You know I get heli-
Coptered out of my own mind
The doctor proctored my test
But you need not remind me
That this life is cyclical
I’m putty in god’s hands man
My buddy
It's fucking paramount
To get a golden parachute
This life is rare amount of time
But you know that we get the shoot
We're gonna lose and dilute
And leave a weird residue
I don't know
Who are you
All of these night critters
Are giving me real jitters
In the morning I won't eat fritters
I'll probably eat more smoothie
I wonder how much more there is
A lot
It doesn't have much fizz
Although at some point I have to drink the redbull-y
And then you will have to pull me
Up
On my ass from the couch
And I don't know if I doubt
Myself
I just drop these lyrical thesis
Theoretical theses
You know I make theses

"Women, Women, Women",A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"Looking out my window
Talking to my cat like he's kinfolk, 
I sip a coke and I drink slow
I'm in limbo
, no plan B
No girlfriend, I just need to meet a nympho
But I won't cause I'm more sensitive than my lymph nodes
And I give too much info
You can't unzip after saying dumb shit like
Like 
I hear your name every time the wind blows
I gave a chilly chick my jacket and my skin froze
And then she jacked it and just ran off with my thin clothes
I guess that shit makes her a heartbreaker in my windbreaker
I'm not tripping off the bimbos, I just think about the puns that I can spit later
She couldn't salt me, she was just a hip shaker
And to answer the question that you implied in your eyes
No, I don't think that I'm smarter than a fifth grader

Graduated to the next level and I hopped in my Delorean
Aurora borealis in my rearview, man it's glorious
Waking up at noon, I'm notorious
I'm gonna roll the dice, I'm very lucky, but fuck it
Papa needs a new pair of Huggies in this life of hard knocks
Feeling like the Hulk, I throw my enemies against the wall across the room like they were my alarm clock
After dark, car parked right on our block
Arm wrapped around the card stock chick propped up in the passenger seat for a sweet one-way heart to heart talk
I think I'm 
ahead of my age like I'm Dippin Dots
These women that I've dated lately really seem to think I'm odd Strange, they just nod, 
which is hard
Without a head on their shoulders like Ichabod Crane

Ladies, Ladies, Ladies

Fuck It Up,Complaint,2019.0,"Oh no, hey
Oh no, hey

Excuse me while I fuck it up
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
Excuse me while I fuck it up
Again

Wanna crash in slow-mo (Oh no)
Repeat our patterns and blow, oh no
I’m all plaid, you’re all mad
The amateur saboteur's 'bout to go pro
What I know is that the people aren't runnin' the show
Any minute to another they come and they go
And they never gonna get what the government owe
So do what you gotta to pick up enough of the dough
I don't see the benefit of us comin' to blows
Give it a second, honey, I bet I'll be stubbin' my toe
What we got doesn’t come by a lot
So we shoot every shot to work it out
But I’m dumb in love, out of touch
Is it too much or not enough?

Please excuse me while I fuck it up
Please excuse me while I fuck it up
I was just getting to know you

Wanna burn the house down (Oh yeah)
Pack up and get outta town (Oh yeah)
Drive without turning around
Arrive ridin' the waves and hold hands while we drown
Ain't no limit, never heard of high ceilings
Never timid, it’s a certified G thing
Even after getting thirty-five bee stings
Still the motherfucker wouldn't hurt a fly's feelings
But being nice is sometimes not so nice
It’s not so nice, no, no (Nice)
Got dropped, didn't stop
I was caught up in my life like
Hey, batter batter, hey, batter batter
Hey, better suck it up, buttercup
Bottom of the ninth, look sharp
I was lookin' out for love and I puckered up
Better buckle up 'cause I fuck it up again and again
And I’m sick of picking up my stupid-ass heart each time

Every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time

Excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Please excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)
Please excuse me while I fuck it up (Every time, every time, every time)

Awesome Phone Commercial,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Georgie Porgie used his 4G
Group text to set up an orgy
It's not just a smart phone, it's a Mensa
So healthy it's made of polenta
Not expensive and it tastes great
It'll help you lose weight
Lames can't hate
The phone is a boat and the boat's ship shape
I wish we could date
It's so tip top
It's magic and amazing and it won the Civil War
Singlehandedly for the North
So hip hop, ask Rick Ross
He's got twelve
You could write to Santa, you could mug an elf
We should called it iBate
Put the phone to vibrate
Stick it in my pocket then I touch myself
Add the Bluetooth undies
And I can steady talk it up
When I be talking out my behind
Get it get it get it
And then I get it again and again
You get a dozen of them
And be buzzing like a beehive
Is like an ancient demigod
And I love it and I grovel at the feet of it
And when it rings I leave it little offerings
And all the mortal imitators got to go
It's hotter than a habenero pepper in a lava flow
I was lame and afraid
But now I get laid
And now I get paid
It's better than competitors
And spreading like an epidemic
And you better get it or you're going to get AIDS",https://genius.com/Watsky-awesome-phone-commercial-lyrics
Savage,Placement,2020.0,"You got me feeling like my tongue is a machete
Each time I think of you, I'm sharpening the blade
Does that make me savage?
Say I'll never hurt you while I twist the knife again
While I twist the knife again
Something I was sad about
While I twist the knife again
Something I was sad about
While I twist the knife again
Something I was sad about
All I want is everything that ever was and ever will be
You can kill me if you think that that's too much to ask
But if you shoot, I want the world's greatest death scene
And the world's collected treasure shoved inside my diamond-studded cask
And yeah, I covet love
So when I went and told her that I loved her like I never loved another
It was burning in my marrow
I could not imagine how my world was gonna spin, but it spun
And I know, so did I
If you need me, I'll be hiding over there
'Cause I want my fucking privacy
But also sometimes I would like to really overshare
A silly golden chair
A throne to call my own, a home for my entitled ass
Where I can act like I don't care
Climb Rapunzel's hair and then be donezo
Or a dunce cap and a stool
An empty corner that a fool can sit and stare at
And think on how I hurt her
Murder, murder, murder
Murder, murder, murder
For whatever it's worth, I still hope that you're good
Just 'cause you can doesn't mean that you should
You got me feeling like my tongue is a machete
Does that make me savage?
You got me feeling like my tongue is a machete
Each time I think of you, I'm sharpening the blade
Does that make me savage?
Say I'll never hurt you while I twist the knife again",https://genius.com/Watsky-savage-lyrics
What Goes Up,Complaint,2019.0,"It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high 'til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay (Uh, uh)

If you tell me I'm the one
While we're lying in the sun
Would you sign it on a piece of paper?
Do you know what you're about?
Could we live beyond our doubts
In a world where we don't need erasers?
Could you ever love a thief?
Can I steal away your grief
And suspend your disbelief?
Let's put on a show
'Cause it's never what you say
No, it's always in the way
That you say what you mean
Oh, oh, oh
Wrap your legs around my back
And hold me tight until we're talkin' in tongues
Then when we pass the spirit
We can yell forever at the top of our lungs

Just float
Just float
Just float

It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high 'til we both float away
We won't show today
Doesn't matter what they say
What goes up can stay

Don't sweat the goons
All we do is crack a smile
When we hear 'em callin'
""You should go get a room""
Ever stop to think the pollen in the air
Is from all the flowers fuckin' each other?
But why not let them bloom?
Let's get consumed
Outside, outside, outside
Inside o' you
So forget me not
We're doin' trust falls
Up at the mountaintop
C'mon, don't let me drop
Now that we've found a spot
And when we swung high on the pendulum
We just hung there in the sky

Just float
Just float
Just float

It's too nice out
Let's play hooky
And get high 'til we both float away
We won't show today

Two Blue Moons,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"A couple red sons popping out a new womb
Twins come twice, once in a blue moon
Feeling like a joke in the nude, rude humor
We were born premature, and they said ""Too soon""
Sing a new tune, act less fickle
Most twins cling like a pair of testicles
We haven't been tight since we breastfed little
Said me on the right and you on the left nipple
Said it's that simple, have to discover
If you act a bit smothered while you're trapped with big brother
9 long months kicking it inside our mother
Never kicked her belly, hell, we only kicked each other
If we suffer we can get well when we grow
Get born, ready? Go! Got a separate embryo
Breaking like a levee though, wading through the heavy flow
When you see the light, let me know (bro)

The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (No) know (No) know (No) know (No) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)
I want to tell you, my brother, I feel the same way too

There were weeks you can bet I couldn't eat
Looking at my cooking with a set of wooden teeth
Opened up my big mouth, found that I could speak
So I put another foot in it, but now I couldn't leave
It's good to see all the losers taking days
To think of dumping shit on you in new, creative ways
You can say that it's a phase
Or some rude complaining crap
It's a stupid way to act, man, but two can play at that
I've been a brat, made more than one slip
My lips got unzipped, I quipped some dumb shit
Our folks were so sick, it made them cringe
I followed my jaw's lead, and came unhinged
I'm sorry man, but can the shit end here?
Cause we haven't really talked in about ten years
And that's ten too many cause if you were anyone else
I wouldn't see you in myself

The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (No) know (No) know (No) know (No) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)
I want to tell you, my brother, I feel the same way too
Aching in the chest, try to take it from the stress
Shrink made me quit, I was making him depressed
Usually I'm upbeat, tearing through the halls
But instead of bouncing off 'em I was staring at the walls
Care to make the call which separates faster
A fence of placenta, an inch made of plaster
A handful of strands of our DNA
Either we both were alone or it seemed that way
Kept to myself, I'd reflect by myself
Dude, I left and I fucking saw Shrek by myself (Oh no!)
It's no help to assume we're less than
To mom it's yes ma'am, I'm groom, you're best man
It's on the next fam to plan and proceed
But if we smoke weed, don't think we OD'd
No I don't know all the shit you've been through
But I've seen a window, and I know I've been too

The moon is out tonight (It's bright)
Is everything alright? (Not quite)
I wouldn't act like I know (No) know (No) know (No) know (No) know
Just what you're going through (No shit)
But if you're feeling blue (Don't quit)

Ask Me Anything,A New Kind of Sexy,2012.0,"You want to know

To tell you how it is
There
Isn't ever much
Cracking the coconut hoping to get me to open wide
Now
If you want to know
Then all you have to do is ask me
I don't have a thing to hide
I walk in the office of my orthodontist and without a warning
My jawbone is already pried
And honestly, I've never lied
Second to none
If I pucker my lips and I lickem I'm looking to kick an impeccable pun
I don't kick it like Beckham
I kick it like Beckham a decade ago when I run my mouth
You think I'm a megalo-maniac
A lout?
I'll be begging to differ
Try sticking a flute or a piccolo
Up a particular part of your pecker
But I'll let you pick it though
I'm out
I'll chuck up a deuce-- a bigalow
And be cracking a Michelob
And I give a toast
And I trickle a bit in the gutter for all of my bigger bros
And I walk it out
Now
If you want to know
Then all you have to do is ask me
Not a thing to hide
I'm trying to be totally open like all the time
Now

Then all you have to do is ask me

I Got This Love,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

Because of Jonestown
Because of Auschwitz
Because the leaves fall and we can't stop it
But that makes fall leaves
I'mma start a mosh pit
(ch!) This is your captain
Hopping out the cockpit
I forgot my parachute
But I got my bay sounds
So I'll be going dummy
Rocking on the way down
I'll be saying, ""Hey ground!""
Howzabout we make out?
I'll put on some Ray Brown
You can grab some take out
Love isn't more sin, love isn't forced in
Getting under your skin, digging for endorphins
It's the portion some of us'll forgo
Fingers on your torso tapping you in Morse code
The opera aria we're singing like a bar song
The stranger's pretty face that hits you like a car bomb
The wrinkled note we passed in class in second grade
And all it says up on the page (is)

I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

Because my Grandma lived to 99-eleven months
Between a hundred years of solitude and heaven once
Because she loved her son but couldn't ever say it right
Because the language of the planet isn't day and night
It's in the in between, it's when we intervene
And never let a silly hater rabbit pimp the scene
For the deaf kid in the aisle of the symphony
Who hears it through the rumble of the tuba and the timpani
For those lay waste to beauty with a straight face
Everywhere on earth we're all escaping from the same place
And, yes, occasionally we get drunk and out of line
Last night, there's a lamp post that I asked to be my valentine
Take a shady place, shine until it radiates
Seventeen to eighty eight, make a break and head west
Or make a promise to your lady in a red dress
Last night in my hot mess
That lamp post said yes

I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because
I got this love, I-I got this love, why, I got this love
Because, because, because, because

Detroit is equal till there's half its people laid off
While corporate lawyers and former employers play golf
Because of furor over every juror paid off
And because the Führer used to be a boy named Adolf
Because of Anakin, instead of panickin'
And because of every man who can be more than just a mannequin
Because of Tienanmen, because there was a cameraman
And because of the cameraman chasing princess Diana and
Because of Tammany hall, because of Gramercy park
Because of Amityville and because of amnesty
Because of famine and because its not a fantasy
Because of every tenement into family
Tentative to say cause of combs cause of hannity
Homes for humanity the bones of my ancestry
Grown and gone on gravestones and drawn on payphones and palms
Raised up in alms",https://genius.com/Watsky-i-got-this-love-lyrics
Write Your Name,Nothing Like the First Time,2012.0,"Yesterday I signed my first tit
Soft with the ballpoint cause I didn't want to burst it
I did it cursive. I took my sweet time
I tried to put my personality in each line
Like I do with each rhyme
Cause in the worst case
That's what put this bust in my custody in the first place
Now I'm rounding first base, cruising cause I paid dues
Dude, I called my roommates and I gave them all the great news
They're pitiless
But so many nights up at the motel 6, tittyless
After gigs with hideously small crowds
It's been 5 years of playing colleges in small towns
I'm through with all doubt
I'm ready to bloom from wallflower
And just ball out
And live my fantasy
And if I get my name on a grammy it's for my family
But for me I just can't top the memory of my john hancock on that mammary

Why are we
Shy to be
Who we all would like to be?
Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see
Although you
Can't undo
All the pain that you've been through
Write your name
Write your name
Write your name

The future's here, and it's tangible
And kind of spongy
I'm a commie but I love my fucking country right now
Just let play the fillmore and die now
I couldn't give a damn about who's raising an eyebrow
I thought I'd failed, I prayed for so long
God said ""no way,"" but I'm all like, 'come oooon'
And he's all like ""okay""
And at first I'm all like ""don't play""
But then I'm all like ""hooray!""
And I grabbed that baton
And ran like a Cavs fan, away from Lebron
Now they gab about me in banks and salons
And they're mad to admit it, but pale kid's the bomb
From anonymous geek
To Don Juan in a week
And I'm calm
But if ever I seem gloomy
I can't stress enough how much this means to me
I held the tears in, cause I didn't dare to dream
Of the most beauteous boobie I've ever seen

Why are we
Shy to be
Who we all would like to be?
Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see
Although you
Can't undo
All the pain that you've been through
Write your name
Write your name
Write your name
Why are we
Shy to be
Who we all would like to be?
Write your name so big and bold that the entire world can see
Although you
Can't undo
All the pain that you've been through
Write your name

Say the world is a booby in the palm of my hand

$$,Nothing Like the First Time,2012,"My head's up in the sky it's higher than the clouds are
I like to look up at the stars and wonder how far?
From what I hear, about a billion babies are delivered
Everyday and so it's like the planet is a clown car
I know it probably shouldn't work, but we all fit
Like a Micky D's Play Place ball pit.
So look at me! I'm about to jump up in it
And be swimming through syringes like a motherfucking dolphin
I could have an outburst. There's a lot of freaky people
On the planet and it makes me want to crowd surf
Everybody, everywhere dig downwards
That's what we work for. Party at the Earth's core
Don't know where to go to go far
But if I go then I know I should go hard
And if I go and I never come back
Then I'll send a post card and a couple thumb tacks

Said I'm looking...
I'm looking...
I'm looking for energy everywhere
I'm looking...
I'm looking...
I'm looking for energy

Teacher said this party started with a loud bang
The waymy ears are ringing I don't hear sound, man
I'm steady looking at the crowd like a proud dad
For coming out instead of clicking on a mouse pad
Steal a bounce-house. Fill it full of helium
Ride it like a blimp. I think that it'd be really fun
To do a triple flip in zero gravity
While puffing on a Philly blunt and shooting stars with a BB gun
Tonight I'm looking at something that I've never seen before
I might even paint graffiti on a meteor
Cause I can reach it, homie. Veni vidi vici
It's all peachy, got a vision of the future on a Ouija board
Didn't believe it I, though it was CGI
Why don't you decide, if we're computerized?
Assuming you and I - are alive
And tomorrow is the rapture I wonder what you want to do tonight

I don't wanna. I don't wanna. I don't wanna. I don't wanna
I don't wanna end up as an anybody-everybody
Isn't anybody made of arteries and antibodies
And you never get to see confetti without getting bloody
If you read ahead, you'd all be surprised
Spoiler alert – we're all going to die
But I'll be hooping in the drive way in the clouds
Shooting fouls with that big orange ball in the sky
When I die. When I say 'well I made it', I'll be way
Celebrated, or remain as a staple
If I stay hella faded, then I'll fade, and my fate will be the same
As the fakers with the chains on the labels
Shame people do it for the fame and the cash
Not the flame and the passion. I train through the pain
And I frame every passage as a way to stay fit
Cause an 808 kick is my Gatorade drink",https://genius.com/Watsky--lyrics

I've been down before
My best friend, the floor
Met you in a parking lot out in Santa Cruz
Said your life's pretty dark now you have to choose
'Cause your home's not a home, not in any way
So on the phone, you were like ""Um, anyway
Hey, think it's time that I end it all""
So I stall trying to not let you end the call
'Cause as long as you're here and you don't go
I won't have to face that I fear what I don't know
I've been doing donuts all around my head
Watch me flip my Miata, baby, now I'm dead
I'm a punk, such a punk, but I don't pretend to know you
I don't pretend to know you
So why should I say that you've got to stay
When every time I fell in love, I walked away?
Fair play, but this is not like that, no, it's not like that
This is not like that
We fit nice, hand to glove
So would you take some advice from a man in love?
'Cause the one, one thing that I know for sure
Is we're gonna get out, yeah, we're gonna get out

And I would stare at the crack
On my ceiling, I would snap right in half
Just like the roof of our shack
It happened in the quake of 1989
And every time that I was not feeling fine
I'd ditch that crack and I would fall down the coast
Down to Santa Cruz, fall down to Santa Cruz
And I'm so lucky that I got friends, I'm so glad for that
And all my nonsense, they won't stand for that
So all my rejects hit the eject button, take a heat check, cousin
We could not be nothing if we wanted to
Wannabes, I wanna honor you
Shout out to all the cool kids out at Bonnaroo
Goner you, goner me, watch for the gonorrhea
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, honestly
Have your fun before the day is done
In the warm California sun
I said, I said, have your fun before the day is done
In the warm California sun

Pauly Shore Saw My Penis,A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"You couldn't see a lot with our crotches under froth
On timer-jets the trouble started when the bubbles stopped
Now, if you wanted, you could see each little boy wand
Bobbing there as clear as little goldfish in a koi pond
And I was hot and pruny, as dry as Styrofoam
I needed to escape the tub like Pauly from the Biodome
I know no boychick's poifect, but I made the noble choice
And hoisted myself out of the moistness
Slowly which exposed my joystick
And Pauly must have seen it, plain as I'm waving at you
Because I stood there dripping, naked like the David statue
Pauly I've gotta ask you because I'm just not psychic
If my penis was a Facebook post, I wonder if you'd like it

All my life
I prayed for a friend like you
And I wish I could glance at your Linus too
But you wore a fucking Speedo, you bitch

I can't express just what it's meant to me
To have my genitals vetted by a celebrity
And one with Paulie's pedigree, I'm talking Breeder's Cup
If Charlie Sheen had seen my peen, it wouldn't mean as much
He doesn't have the Weasel's touch, I'm not some stupid groupie
This dude was in Biodome, Encino Man, A Goofy Movie
And probably other stuff, I just think it's fucking nuts
That Mister Pauly Shore himself was gazing at my buttercups
I dreamed to be discovered, I hope the wait is over
Not sure if this is it, but either way it's great exposure
And I can't blow this chance to have a bro romance
I hope he picks the fruit that dangles from my lowest branch
I'll pick the slowest dance, I just can't handle this
Perhaps I should expect it at a men's spa in Los Angeles

When I'm thirty five I'll learn to work a potter's wheel
When I'm forty I'll forty go streaking at a soccerfield
And if they try to tackle me then I'll distract em flapping my arms and happily shrieking like a coccatiel

And then go back to skinny really really fast
And then go skydiving with no parachute and glide around like I'm a flying squirrel with my skinflaps
Like a creepy Aladdin (Just need my Jasmine)

If yesterday's a pain in the ass
Tomorrow's an aspirin
And you might be feeling better than you ever could imagine
At seventy I'll rock sandals with black socks
When I'm eighty I'll try heroin or crack rocks
Or both-- And mix em in a smoothie
I'll be old and toothless
And I'll be feeling groovy
I'll make out with school teachers
Chill at nude beaches
And free the zoo creatures
And if they tell me it's a issue for my health
I'll tell em bitch I'm ninety you can kindly fuck yourself
I'm just being really really really really really really really real right now
And so I just plan on doing what I really really really really feel like now

I probably won't bang all the girls I liked in high school
Although that would be quite cool
But I'll list their names out on some wide rule
Paper
And I'll call each one of them and tell them that I really would have liked to love em
Back in the day
Not to be a creeper obviously
Just to see who'd respond positively
And just take it from there
We'll just take it from there
I hope you answer my prayers

I don't wanna mock
Ever yet I let it slip
Said I gotta get a grip
Cause I know you're delicate
And I'm pretty adamant
I can learn some etiquette
Bet on it that I can talk a book and never edit it
Seldom elegant, guilty of embellishing
Yelling but I'm holding shit together like I'm gelatin
We're both jealous and selfish, I'm hella slim
But I gotta bigger mouth than a pelican
Check a fella sing, messing up the melody
I know my alphabet, A to L-M-N-O-P
I like you, it shouldn't be shocking
My heart's beating just as loud as I'm talking

I know you know

Before I kiss my girl I put her on a sugar high

Taking something mundane and give yourself a tongue sprain?
You talk about your day and go off for a year
And I could walk away or hold the phone off of my ear
I don't love what I hear, but I've got to stay
Cause man, smart girls have a lot to say
I want to shout with someone that I'm down with
There's no one I'd rather run my mouth with

I know you know
I know you know
Sometimes I say things
I don't quite mean

They’re Not Ready,A New Kind of Sexy,2011.0,"*clears throat*
...watsky?

I'm that dork up in the orchestra on oboe, trick
You're just trying to get some chickens on your pogo stick
But they'll be hopping off it when you stop the profiting, and then with no dough you'll be like a Dodo when you go extinct
I'm in San Francisco sipping on a boba drink
Tapioca in my palm I talk how Yoda thinks
The voice is so distinct
I like to write my rhymes with lemon juice
And so if you don't get it it's in coded ink
Better believe this
I'm ready to meet Jesus
Either him or Willford Brimley when I die from Diabeetus
I've never been defeated since da fetus days
Lead the way
Raged out my momma's VJ, crazed and freed the slaves
Wait I take it back, that's racist and I'd need a time machine and I'm not pleased to be like T-Pain, a fleeting phase
But since my pre-Ks in PJs, I pre-date the Bieber craze
I've been rhyming crispier than Frito-Lays

Everything Turns Gold,Guilty Pleasures,2016.0,"When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold

The frog in my throat was the size of a mutt
The fat toad ate the butterflies in my gut
The dog in me knows that it's a bitch in dark black
So I spit the frog out and I took my bark back
Till that i'd been afraid of night
My cradle never stayed in sight
It might have all abated if I played it right
I hated tryna find and face a place I didn't dare go
Diving with the worms and liking looking like a scarecrow
Do a mellow jig instead of tripping off a dollar
I'll just skip the yellow brick with wicker sticking out my collar
It's all or nothing i'll be cultured when I'm older
Fuck a parrot, I don't care I'll feed the vulture on my shoulder
(Polly want a collarbone?)
Try the lake for fish
Or just say yes to yesterday break it and make a wish
I ate dirt as a baby, I did it for the flavor
In a couple years i'll let the dirt return the favor

When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold

Yeah
I used to consider the riches and the props
And the houses and the fame and the fortune, everything
Seems when you get here, there seems more desirable
All that old fear doesn't leave, it's inside of you
Everything material, it passes like the night'll do
Into day
Came and went away
Nothing penetrates the void that illustrates the noise
Mental states annoyed with a attitude of zero gratitude that may destroy
Beneath the lies is truth though
You seek and find the proof
Only place to be is here
Dig in, peep it how the roots grow
From out of nowhere into nothingness and back
Constantly expresses everything and everyone
And acting as a thread
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Karma that you spread
May be relived again after you live again after you're dead
Until you merge into the blissful field of mighty power
But time is an illusion, all of it's within you now

The sun is going down
Drink another round
Play until you fold
Paint the city gold
Remember what you've heard
Don't say another word
Until you shake your bottle up and spray a little on the curb
Remember what you own
Take the sunset home
If no one's out right now
I hope you know you're not alone
Try to find some nights
To watch the shining lights
Park see the city sparkle out on diamond heights
All those attractive glass spires
That we love to stack higher
I'm starting grass fires
When my car backfires after four flat tires
Rolling off road to avoid the bad drivers
Coming back home and I climb the walls into the sky on tall risers
To make it all brighter
Blaze your lighters up
Raise your cider cup
And let's pull an all-nighter

When the sun sets on the city
It's something to behold
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
For now you're young and pretty
And you'll be lovely when you're old
Cause when the sun sets on the city
Everything turns gold
When the sun sets on the city

Leopards & Horseshoes,UnKnown,2013.0,"What makes a human different than the rest of the food chain
Is not that we are at the top of it
When I got my first pet ever, a leopard gecko, back from the pet store, 
I was distressed
""No no no no no no, don't do this to me... What do you mean leopard geckos can't climb walls? The whole freaking point of getting a gecko is so you can send them on spy missions!""
I learned to love him for what he was not
I named him Sizzler
After my favorite restaurant
Where you could get chicken nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs
Let me tell you, there is no more inspiring buffet item
Than a lump of reconstituted chicken parts that styles itself as a Stegosaurus
So Sizzler was a fitting name for a Leopard Gecko
The earthbound gecko
That chooses to live not as some wannabe green reptilian Spiderman
but as a ferocious jungle cat
A truly aspirational beast
Following in the glorious tradition of the Whale Shark
The Cat Fish
The Egg Plant
And of course the Horseshoe Crab
A crab that dreams of being... a horses shoe
I fed Sizzler live crickets that lived in a terrarium that sat in the bathtub
So in case they somehow managed to escape the cage
They would struggle fruitlessly against the impossibly high porcelain prison walls
I'd shake the crickets up in a paper bag full of protein powder like some fucked up death maraca before he crunched in
A wing or spare leg hanging out his lower jaw like salad greens
I couldn't figure out why I was feeding my pets to each other
I had this little secret
Sometimes I would slip into the bathroom and carelessly
-whoops- glance the terrarium and slide the roof a crack to grant crickets that could climb that granite slab a fighting chance
If they made it over they were honorary geckos
A couple earned their freedom and escaped into the wall paneling
Where played their tiny violins as long as they had music in their legs
I gave sizzler back to the pet store
I stopped eating at his namesake restaurant
I started thinking if chickens wanted to be dinosaurs we should let them enjoy the privilege while they were still alive
It was years before I came to the conclusion that you can't stop the brutal beauty of the food chain by removing yourself from it
There is no life without death
There's no way to live perfect
So flush that dream down the toilet
Anyone who's owned a teakettle knows that even water screams when you boil it
Anyone who's driven a car on the freeway has committed bug genocide
Even if you're a vegetarian, your super market produce is sprayed with a product called insecticide
How do you rectify that people are dying and Watsky, you're worried about crickets?
in a world not yet rid of rape and murder
You're talking beef and pig on baconburgers
When kids still beef with pigs on Hegenberger
I'm not saying we don't need to look after US.
Just that we lose nothing by expanding our definition of ""Us""
What makes humans special is not our ability dominate those more vulnerable than ourselves
It's our willingness protect them
To empathize
No, mothafucka, it's not an excuse to dress your dog like a sailor on shore leave
That's obnoxious
I'm aware geckos don't want to leopards & crickets aren't pretending to be lizards
Those are human projections onto animals that are simply out here trying to function
I do, however, believe in the horseshoe crab
The crab that dreams of being a horse's shoe
And maybe you've never seen four living crustaceans glue themselves underneath a thoroughbred's hooves
Go ahead and tell me there's no way that thin exoskeleton could support a two ton Clydesdale
Don't believe me. But I've seen it.
Brave New Voices, do you believe in the horseshoe crab?
I said, ""Hey Horse, nice shoes.
That horse, ""I'm touched. I didn't realize people were actually capable of feeling things
You know... I'm not naïve, human
I know that horseshoe under me is no horseshoe at all
Hell, don't tell him, but it's not even a horseshoe crab
If you lean in, you can tell by the shell it's actually a hermit crab
The genuine article
And I'm no horse—Bitch, I'm a barnacle.""",https://genius.com/Watsky-leopards-and-horseshoes-annotated
Bad Words,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"You know, I think it's hella cool
My mom's a librarian at an elementary school
I'm proud of her, she taught me how to be
And what's awesome is my mom is also proud of me
Her greatest compliment was paid
When she invited me as speaker to the whole fourth grade
She wanted me to kick some spread your wings and fly shit
Crushing on some inspiring touch the sky shit
What sucks is that before I did
Mom couldn't show my videos to any of the kids
She realized all my clips had alcohol and opiates
And none of them had language that was close to age appropriate
So she said, ""so be it just come be you today,""
And that was cool until we got into the Q&A
They raised their hands but all the questions that they had
Were why I used so many words that were considered bad?

Bad words
The shit's pretty complex
But kids, bad words are all about context
What the fuck is a bad word?
I don't know what's real
When you call ""fuck"" a bad word
How you think that makes ""fuck"" feel?
Probably pretty bad

The deal is I think it's a real pity
If you use a word to make a person feel shitty
Like saying ""Arab"" to make a Persian feel shitty
Not like saying ""pussy"" when you mean a real kitty
Or even saying ""pussy"" when you're stuck and you're tryna
Find a loving way to talk about your wife's vagina
""I'll love my wife until the fucking world stops
And when it comes to fucking pussy, Dinah's pussy is the tops""
See? That shit's positive
But when you're cursing
Just be careful that you don't objectify a person
See, I would tell my mom that she's the motherfucking shit
Because she is and 'cause it fits our hippy Bay relationship
You see, ""shit"" just means ""poopoo"" or ""caca"" or ""doodoo,""
But we say that it's a nono which I just think is cuckoo
Or loco or bullshit
Yeah, but it's okay because the fact that words are bad
Are what make them fun to say

Bad words
Are just our invention
Kids, bad words
Are about our intentions
What the fuck is a bad word?
I don't know what's real
When you call ""shit"" a bad word
How you think that makes ""shit"" feel?
Probably shitty",https://genius.com/Watsky-bad-words-lyrics

Wouldn't be an awful way to die
Little spider, little spider, look me in the eye
Hover over me and smother me
Don't let me draw another breath tonight
We only get one shot at being torn to pieces
I think we could get it right
It's been a boring couple years
And I could use a good obliteration now

You sucked me into the void
I look forward to being destroyed

Breakbeat,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"Life’s a bitch
Sad violinists when I sold their violas
Pissed like a hippie when you stole their granola
In the desert looking for a cold cherry cola
Life’s hard like a cold areola
My thoughts tend to do hand grenade harm
I think, therefore I amputate arms
I’m not always a man with great charm
But I’ll be there like the man from State Farm
I’m dedicated to getting better
Like meth-heads are dedicated to finding methods of getting faded
Defecated on microphones in every state in the land
So I better be scrubbing up before you’re shaking my hand
I’m making a stand
Put me in a jam I hang tough
Scram when I break my handcuffs
And I will shake every snake every fake soft motherfucker off like flakes of dandruff
If they use my back as a staircase I get up in their face
And give em a rare taste
Of genuine bear mace
If you’re in my airspace, I’m shootin' you down
If you think you’re king I’m surgically removing your crown
I’m movin' around
Have some trouble choosin' a town
Cause when I move I never lose any ground
At any given moment it’s hard to really tell
At what city I dwell
Find me in Philly bangin' my head on the Liberty bell
I tried but if you're looking far
You don’t have to check where the rookies are
I work hard like a Wookiee barber
Luke Skywalker any naughty hand caught in a cookie jar
I don’t know how many days before me
Gonna go out in a blaze of glory
Savor the phases, the crazy, the tame
And then tell an amazing story",https://genius.com/Watsky-breakbeat-lyrics

Other Cities,Nothing Like the First Time,2012.0,"There's nothin' like the feeling of the plane flight homeward;
The way my stomach dips when the landing gears lowered;
Because no matter how many miles that I wander;
The bay bridge curves like a smile on the water;
I'm like, what up missy?
Tell me you were missin' me;
With this pretty city skyline lit up like a Christmas tree;
The buildings shimmering like pinky rings from Tiffany's;
Every time I witness it I have a damn epiphany;
That this is me! This is where I've got the richest history;
Stacked with six or seven memories on every single street;
I never missed a beat;
I'm soaked in city pride;
And me oh my, this foggy sky got me misty eyed;

There might be other cities half as raw as ours;
(just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
Out in some distant galaxy among the stars;
(But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it)

We don't play tiny violins over minor things;
We slide into the ring takin' Tyson swings;
Because this city will defend our fuckin' pride
And raise each other up like Simba in the Lion King;
We're not shy;
I ain't no coy coward;
I'll be doin' trust falls offa Coit tower;
My boys on the ground floor providin' man power;
But if I die now, mix me into clam chowder;
Put me in a bread bowl, feed me to the seagulls;
But not the freakin' tourists;
I'm sure they're peachy people;
I guess I'm just a purist;
It isn't oil, but there's somethin' in the water
And it's got me feelin' diesel;

There might be other cities half as raw as ours;
(just as 'bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it)
Out in some distant galaxy among the stars;
(But I doubt it, doubt it, doubt it)

Ain't no love, in the heart of the city;

How it Used to Be,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"Tell me how it used to
How it used to
How it used to be

One time, a psychic had told me something 'bout my future life
How I would live to be a hundred with my future wife
Surrounded by my great grandchildren
Reading the funnies and telling ‘em stories
'Bout how things were different in my 20’s, like:
""Gather round, you two, shut off the TV
I got a story, and maybe you youngins might not believe me
But 80 years ago, the world wasn’t so kind, then
Now it sounds silly but I remember a time when
There was so many of us in love with one another
And tried to show it but couldn’t 'cuz they wouldn’t let a pair of people
Share a life together 'cuz they said it was evil and against the law
But them laws wasn’t fair or equal
People debated and shouted and demonstrated and spouted hatred
Instead of trying to have a conversation about it
But soon it led us to having celebrations about it
Look at what my generation sprouted"" (Marriage is legal!)
Then the psychic took her small fee
I thought about the way things were before me
And how every generation gets a little more free
I felt hope thinking how things could all be
In eighty years I guess we gon' see when our grandkids saying to us

Tell me how it used to be
Cause we’ve come so far
Tell me how it used to be
Tell me how it used to
How it used to
How it used to be

""Grandpa, is it true what they say?
That way back in the day day
You know? Like way back, like mad long
That President Riff-Raff used to write rap songs?
And I heard the people lit nicotine
But they weren’t allowed their sweet, sweet sticky green
And they let a kid be shipped to Iraq
But they wouldn’t let him sip on a whiskey when he was back!""
Yep, that’s back when life was a terminal illness
Before that doctors learned that we came
With a little switch every person turned in their brains
When life was overwhelming and so we turned from the pain
Back when slums grew in the shadows
Of a 170 story chateaus
And the people under ‘em fought
For the crumbs that fell from the windows up at the top
We claimed freedom but our elections were bought
By a high-spitting executive, not a second of thought
Back when corporations were people but people weren’t even people
And people just weren’t connecting the dots

Tell me how it used to be
Cause we’ve come so far
Tell me how it used to be
Tell me how it used to
How it used to
How it used to be

People would hate you over what spirit you prayed to
You talk and they wouldn’t hear it
They fear it and decapitate you
And back in the states all we’re doing is just always say that they're doing
Placing humans in boxes over what appearance they're near to

I fill in boxes, they said inside of it was a future
They bomb a school full of students and do away the computers
Technology, we can use it on mother earth to improve her
Instead we steady abuse her but was it worth the maneuver?

Who are we kidding? You and me didn’t ruin the system
But soon the kids who crawled out of the sewers grew to be different

Brutally killing for power’s not our true intuition
So we flip the script now we living with the newest traditions

Smashing the walls and dancing and drinking
Wine in the kitchen

Kissing and hugging and laughing
Fuck it we shining and winning

Women and men looking back and telling

Reminding the children of how it

How it
 
How it

How it
 
How it

How it
 
How it

How it

Duke Smellington,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"Don't ask me if I am an assassin
If you have to unmask me
Baby you are now in peril
Every aspect of me counts as an asset
Homie even my ass sweat goes for 20 thou a barrel
You're scowlin' and then throwing the towel in
While I enter the tao inside a temple in Shaolin bitch
You're now listening in to a loud citizen
Shouting devout discipline up on a mountain
Low key I'm a shape shifter like Loki
Locally known loco, vocally home G
Taking the A-train and I'm swinging like Duke E
Calling me Duke Smellington cause I'm a dookey
Dip like Houdini
Dick like zucchini
Sicker than leukemia
Pitiful dudes leave me alone
I get Bruce Lee'd while I sip on a brewski
And I flip through some Bukowski and kick till the brutes bleed
I don't think they really like it when I come around
But I don't think they really like it when I come around
They don't like it when I come around
They don't really like it when I come around
Like it when I come around
I don't think they really like it when I come around
I don't think they really like it when I come around
They don't really like it when I try to come around
Like it when I come around
Like it when I come around",https://genius.com/Watsky-duke-smellington-lyrics
A Love Story,UnKnown,2011.0,"Excuse me, miss, what's your name?
That's a nice name
I had to write this haiku:
""Hi! I like like you
For your high IQ, and you're
Quite fine too. Date me?""
You showed the poem to your friends? (messed up)
Whatever, I don't need it
I can read between the lines, be conceited
I'll beat it, cause I don't really have the T-I-M-E, time
You're coming on a little strong, okay?
I get it
When I was there you barely wanted me
Now I'm scarce commodity
And since I'm rare you care to make my bare bod your property
I'm sorry princess, I boycott your boy ploy, I think it's best
I guess, we have thin common interests
I mean, it's not like your favorite South Park character is
Butters
Or your favorite food is
Mainly Japanese
And Amy's mac and cheese-
You too?
I get pretty torn up when I see roadkill
But damn, I just love manatees, they're so chill, right?
The Beatles are best
I could listen to Lennon again and again and
Especially Penny Lane
And Eminem is a beast with a pen and a pad
And drunk Denny's is better than Bennigan's any day
Odwalla, Koalas, Pico de Gallo, Tika Masala, Hakunah Matata
I'm looking at making a living in doing the one that I love with what I've been given
And I'm thinking that we could maybe bring the power nap back
I eat sugar from the bottom of the Sour Patch pack
Oh, snap!
It's like we're finishing each other's...
I love you, girl, you're my other half
Baby got me high like a hovercraft
Your loving got me high like I'm huffing or I puff and pass
Damn, you're so upperclass!
I want to get up it like a hand up a puppet's ass
Who'd you call a mother-?
You too
Up your-!
Untrue
I mean it, stop it, yo!
Well, if I'm a poor man's Michael Cera
You're Janeane Garofalo
No, your pouncing caused this downswing!
Maybe we should browse around for couple's counseling?
You make me sick, you give me fever
Then leave, I never liked you either!",https://genius.com/Watsky-a-love-story-lyrics
Rome,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"Ice Age or a heat wave
Earthquake or a plague
Terrorism or class warfare
Or the end of days
I asked mama, but she didn’t know
Dad just shook his head
Put a couple ice cubes in his whiskey, sipped it, and went to bed
Can I just pray to God
To give me those Vegas odds
I ask on behalf of a friend
Should I buy my folks a round
Or dig my cash in the ground
I’m starting to think it’s the end

I know, I know we’ll live for a thousand years
What’s in your crystal ball
Tell me, tell me oh where do we go from here
Rome is too big to fall

Other night I was riding on a C train
Packed car, bad mood, when this peabrain
Drunk-ass slicked back hair, having, leather-jacket wearing ass Roger Klotz type o' grease stain
Dude stumbles through the train mad rude shoving a finger in our grills with this attitude
Yelling ""fuck you, fuck you, fuck every one of you
Yeah, yeah that means fuck you too""
So when the train pulls in the next station
This one big ass hardcore bouncer kinda Teamster kinda Paul Bunyon kinda motherfucker shoves a fool out the car door
Throws a haymaker, hits him in the chin
The whole train cheers the win
We’re all high-fiving, feeling excellent
Having extra fun like we’re next of kin
Save all your Kumbayas
Don’t take this shit too far
You don’t make no friends on no New York subway car
How come when we gotta come together
We wait until we got someone that we can all come together to hate
And then for the hottest minute we set our shit aside and relate?
And then forget again

I know, I know we’ll live for a thousand years
What’s in your crystal ball
Tell me, tell me oh where do we go from here
Rome is too big to fall

Nobody wants to die so nobody thinks of it
What if at the blink of an eye we be at the brink of it
We tend to be blind when we’re right up in the thick of it
We got this life to live and it’s at our fingertips
I’m taking my time and trying to be making the most of it
Let’s open a wine bottle and we can all toast a bit
And I never get light when I’m drunk
So fuck all the poser shit
I’m tapping a vein, craving the truth, give me another dose of it
I’m not digging for danger but I decided that I won’t be taking time for my day for denying how I was made or fighting my human nature
I’m only looking to savor the ride
I’ve paid for my pride
Back when I would cry, cry, cry
Spending my life wondering why, why, why
Taking the view soon I know it’s all gonna fly right by
I will not go out like that
We won’t go out like that
We won’t go out like that
We won’t go out like (won’t go out like)
We won’t go out like that",https://genius.com/Watsky-rome-lyrics
Headphones-Amplified,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"Anyway, here's a self-written poem—another self-written poem—entitled 
Procrastination: Story of My Life.
 
I can't hear you (I got my—)
I can't hear you (I got my—)
I can't hear you (I got my—)
I can't hear you (I got—)

I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I got headphones on (I got my headphones on)
When I look at who's around
And it feels like two's a crowd
I don't run and hide
I just smile real wide
And I turn my music loud

It's not practical to react to bull
I was thinking too hard and I cracked my skull
It's natural, erase all doubt
If I take my 'phones off, then my brains fall out
So you can shout, 
empty out your throat on me
It just looks like you're lip-synching Obla Di
Obla da, every time you go, ""blah blah
Blah"" I'm hearing ""life goes on"" like it's your mantra
So talk shit, but when it's prone to go down
You're afraid of your own bull like rodeo clowns
I stay low to the ground, I stay plugged in
And when my dome needs love, 'phones hug my skin
But earbuds don't count, they're headphone loopholes
I want 'em bigger than a couple sideways soup bowls
And if you're sayin' next to nothing
Make like my playlist and get to shufflin'

I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)
I can't hear you (I got my headphones on)

When I look at who's around
And it feels like two's a crowd
I don't run and hide
I just smile real wide
And I turn my music loud

I get up, when you get down to this
Keep cool, but still get loud to this
When it drops just can't deny
The mic's turned off but I'm amplified
So if you want to ride
This young son will come out tonight
And this one tongue will give out the vibe
With this mic off I'm still amplified (I'm still amplified)

We don't just write poems
, 
we got a mic jones (mike jones!)
Giving a fuck, ripping it up in different time zones
I know it's so apropos that it's gotta be said
That I was flowing so hard in the car off the top of my head
When I drove home that my own flows gave me road dome
So go bone, man, but fuck it if you're celibate
Screw the music if you do it 'cause you're sellin' it
Well equipped, man, we do it for the hell of it
Never delicate, hella ripped off the elements
Earth, wind, fire, water top rock echo box
Yo man we got Cosby doing jello shots
I've been tellin' em the melanin's irrelevant
I'm yellin' and you'll feel it from the ceiling to the sediment
Intelligent, epic, and reppin' the Bay
You're tripping if you're thinking that you're getting away

I get up, when you get down to this
Keep cool, but still get loud to this
When it drops just can't deny
The mic's turned off but I'm amplified
So if you want to ride
This young son will come out tonight
And this one tongue will give out the vibe
With this mic off I'm still amplified (I'm still amplified)

The sun is comin' up and runnin' through me
If weather is gettin' better, don't be gloomy
Let's get together, gather up and get it moving and
If you don't like my motherfuckin' music, sue me
A new me, a new reason to be, So unseasonably fine
The ill summer grill serving supper with free sides
Cut to the 'B' side
It's Watsky covered in batter and butter and refried
The speakers are pushin' the roof the tweeters the woofers are proof
The meters are up in the booth
The subs, the mids, the highs, the highers, the lows, the cones all bump duh we're amped, that's the god damn truth
We flowing low in this moment only to sew and be growing over the roses and now that we broke it open we know that we're dope enough we're hoping no one just can't get live
This is how we get amplified

I get up, when you get down to this
Keep cool, but still get loud to this
When it drops just can't deny
The mic's turned off but I'm amplified

Girl Next Door,Guilty Pleasures,2009.0,"It’s a song about girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world’s next door
They see her- everybody melts
She’s the girl next door to everybody else
It’s a song is a song about the girl who sings
And every time you hear her sing
She sings for you
And you alone
And every other guy you know
She loves you back
She says she’s with it
Loves you back
But wait a minute
All along she loved ya back
Enough to put a dagger in it
Cause it's a song about girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world’s next door
They see her- everybody melts
She’s the girl next door to everybody else

So, funny story. I was was really into this girl, a great singer, and I had a musician friend who was really into the same girl. She ended up essentially playing us off eachother. But, we both had these songs that we were gonna do with her, so we just put 'em together

It’s like a fairy tale!
About little chickenhead
Thought the sky was falling
So she kicked it sick in bed
I came calling (she pretended she was dead)
Feeling she was healing but the ceiling fell instead!
Do you feel stellar in your skeleton?
Tell a guy you fell for him then tell him he’s irrelevant?
It’s evident you think you’re Helen of Troy
But you’re hell in a handbasket
Hell of a coy little Cruella de Vil
It’s fitting you fill in
Another filthy felony with every fella you thrill
You’re cellophane
But there’s a spell on us still
A man goes window shopping
And you sell him the sill
You give an illness that isn’t a silly pill or some silvery penicillin
Or pity gonna fulfill and so willing my pen is spilling I’m drilling my point until
The pen point’s dull
The end point’s still
In sight, i’m inside, i’m insisting
Get wise and quit with the lip synching
In christ you entice the quick kissing
Rise in a bathtub full of ice with a rib missing
It’s been decided
You can lie, but you can’t hide behind your eyelids
I provided rhymes and had to plan a hybrid
With the man that led this band who might have liked you more than I did
Or maybe as much
Cause baby that’s what
Make me want to laugh
Just, breaks me right in half cause
It really adds up
Dwelling on this sad stuff
Cellibacy mad sucks
When everybody tapped once
Including a best friend
Then one of my roommates
You said it was just then
But shit it was too late
So what’s your group rate
Cause we’ve waiting our turn
To watch you eat your words
And catch some heartburn

I guess that's the problem, when you have a bunch of people who are artists. You end up falling in love because they're-- they're amazing, y'know you see them on stage, and it's too bad because she really does sing like an angel

(Here) is where you would have sung the verse
(Here) is where you’d have to catch a breath
(Here) is where you might forget the words
 that where you’d laugh to fill the rest
(Here) is where you’d hit another high note
(Here) is where you’d make it pretty, shit if I don’t
(Here) is where we’d really try to be friends
Funny how the shallow girls end up off the deep end
(First) I met your ass last year
First day of class, you were mad sincere
(Then) you went and chose my friend for benefits
(Then) he did the same and said it was the end of it
(Then) funny thing, I got on TV
(Then) coincidentally you said you’d like to see me
(Then) you stood me up on just our second date
Out with mister music
(Then) you used him for a your serenade

It’s a song about girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world’s next door
They see her- everybody melts
She’s the girl next door to everybody else
It’s a song is a song about the girl who sings
And every time you hear her sing
She sings for you
And you alone
And every other guy you know
She loves you back
She says she’s with it
Loves you back
But wait a minute
All along she loved ya back
Enough to put a dagger in it
Cause it's a song about girl the next door
I love the girl next door
The world’s next door
They see her- everybody melts
She’s the girl next door to everybody else

Backburner,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"I remember it was broad daylight
We were mobbing down Broadway right
Past all the North Beach titty bars
Condor Club, Little Darlings and my shitty car
You were looking pretty darn fine in the passenger side of my Momma's old ride and
I was thinking if I don't say shit then I won't say shit
So this scrub shit ends right here
It's been a pain in the ass sitting on this awkward feeling
But I know that it's real and I'm thinking that you probably had an inkling judging how you leaned back sighed and said

""Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side.""
""Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side.""
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner
Keep me on the backburner

So I thought for a bit
Sounds like a hot pile of fuck that shit cause
What about sacrifice?
Doing what we got to cause it's too painful not to
You said ""That's really a beautiful thought but let's not be naive and deceive ourselves.  You're gonna leave California and for your own sake please don't force a mistake""
Life tends to take irregular courses guided by some devilish forces
Maybe you could be my wife stepping from our second divorces before we turn forever to corpses
I just think you're clever and gorgeous
If I ever get to enter that fortress
And pour this pleasure into every orifice
I won't be checking my watch
I won't be checking it

""Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side.""
""Mama said love's only half about love and the other half's time and if you want to find your better half baby then you better have timing on your side.""

Loving Arms,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"If I get too stoned
Then you're gonna have to take me home
And when we're alone
I'll just fall into your loving arms
If I get too stoned
Then you're gonna have to take me home
And when we're alone
I'll just fall into your loving arms
Every time I think about her
I must tuck my tip up under my belt loop
She chops me down and builds me up again in one fell swoop
Superhuman mademoiselle
Only you could crack my shell when you cooly cast your spell
I'm not truly acting well
It's a crying shame
Her name overheats my mindframe till my brain leaps up into flames
Cranium like a lion's mane
And though it's a quiet pain
Deep in my vein, I can attain higher planes through the creep of my migraines
It's quite plain, you got eyes you can see it (see it)
She's beyond the horizon so be it (so be it)
No one's a deity we can agree it
But to reiterate what I stated she is the shit (sheeeeit)
And I'd like to think I'm hard to break
But I saw her and my jaw dropped and I start to shake
And I saw red and I dropped dead
On the autopsy the doc said it was too much booty for one little heart to take

We could split a spliff until we're shit faced
And then maybe we could go to fifth base
Cause I want you bad I got a sick case
And I'm willing if I got to give chase
But we could quit if it's a quick pace
I'm a tortoise I don't run a hare's race
But if you don't want me you could hit space
And then spray me with a can of bear mace
You give me that rare taste
Of all the trimmings that the rest lack
Coming up like a staircase
And you got me floating like a jetpack
Got me turned on like an iMac
No other women got me sidetracked
And I think about it and I think about it
Baby meeting you was such a life hack
And when we're together it's a fucking pleasure
Every single moment is a delight
But if we be knowing that the feel is slowing
Then to keep it going would it be right?
And if we fight and it seems like we know we might
Never see quite in the same light
Then i'll go home and I'll smoke somethin' till I sleep tight
But I'll keep trying
I sees it like ""Please why'd we
Decide to dive in the deep"" and I'm dying to find reasons to
Jump in your shoes, cover my bruises and ball
Better to love and then lose then do nothing at all

I like it
I love it",https://genius.com/Watsky-loving-arms-lyrics
Fast Rapper Watsky Has Damages Rapped up,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ellen Parsons is this young attorney I wish I was dating
Who's busting the wealthy Arthur Frobisher for shady trading
She's under Patty Hewes, a devilish manipulator but no better litigator in the business
But Ellen only got the gig cause the sis of her fiancee David is the case's biggest witness
They subpoena Gregory Molina who's a man that David's sister Kate banged in West Palm Beach
Where he'd seen Frobisher getting in a limo talking to a sketchy fella from the SEC
Patty blackmails Arthur's lawyer who blows his brains out, though what sucks is Ellen sees his body in Patty's office and Patty sends a man to murder Ellen cause she knows too much
Cause Frobisher's attorney had Malina killed but not before he made a tape that and gave it to his good friend Kate - - when David gets it
Frobisher allows a dirty cop to kill him by beating him with a pair a bookends
But they don't find the tape, it's hidden in the murder weapon - -
Ellen is accused and the cop's at large
But Ellen gets it and uses the evidence as leverage over Patty to defend herself drop the charge

Now Ellen's super pissed cause Patty tried to snuff her out
At the firm as a federal informant set on bringing Patty Hewes to justice now
Chemist Daniel Purcell's wife is strangled he's the suspect one
Patty represents him cause he fathered her emo teenaged son
Now Ellen's FBI, Patty takes on UNR, Purcell's former company Appalachia and evading like the haters and the brutes they are
Our boy Frobisher is back, and riddled with guilt, so he said he'll represent the plaintiff's side
But the evidence that Patty has is inadmissible and hoping that the judge'll budge and take a bribe
Changed her mind, doesn't so the federalies fail to pin a thing on her, she's vows to win
Cause Frobisher's a fraud but Purcell's not, his boss goes down with him

Ellen's working for the district, but kinda on one team
With Patty busting the Madoff-like mega Tobin Ponzi scheme
I gotta mention Patty's second in command, Tom Shayes who's got great faith in the courts
Patty said he's never gonna get his name on the door
But he finally does, but when it rains then it pours
Tom was a Tobin investor who lost over seventy percent of all the crap he owned in the bust
But he keeps it a secret from Patty and when all of his remaining crap hit's the fan then he blows Patty's trust
Everybody's looking for the hidden cash but its tough cause it's stashed in a bank in the islands
Using Papa Tobin's illegitimate daughter as a mule
But then they kill her when she's gonna to break her silence
And the Tobin attorney is just a faker posing as a lawyer by the name is Wiggins When the Tobin's know it they disown him and they don't forgive him so he burns 'em and betrays the family to gain immunity and diss 'em
The Tobins fall apart and fight until they're split four ways
Joe Tobin hits the bottle then he snaps and drowns poor Shayes

Lost,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"When I write some shit that's real
When I get a bunch of fans
When somebody understands me
When I win a bunch of Grammys
And Pitchfork writes an article that says that I don't suck
And I laugh off all the praise and 
claim that I don't give a fuck
But I print the page and frame it and I hang it on my wall
And linger at my name each time I pass it in the hall
And remind myself each time I wanna curl up in a ball that someone whose opinion mattered thought I barely sucked at all
And I throw myself a party and invite a bunch of homies
That'll show me just how many other lonely people know me
Then I'll finally be satisified and be convinced I made it
And I'll taper off my meds and get my license reinstated
I'll buy a truck and camper shell
And learn to play guitar
And every night I'll fuck the girl I love and sleep under the stars
And I'll live out in the country til I get the urge to move and start to feel like I got something left to prove
I'm lost
All out of answers
Exhausted
Homelands I've traveled across
Rolled and I've gathered no moss
Only found that I'm lost
I know the fucking mantras
I've done the daily practice
I've tried restructuring my life
The fact is as this planet roams the galaxy rotating on its axis
I'm still anxious throwing random darts up at the atlas
As if I'll address my issues through the issue of my address
But I can't outlast the shadow of this vast expansive sadness
I'm lying on a mattress feeling tragic
Trying not to let my maturation bleed the world of magic
As if abracadabra could patch my spirit's fraying fabric
And I could go back to feeling all syrupy and ecstatic
I crave a blade that's cleaving through this gruesome havoc
Navigating past my weakest thoughts like weaving through some traffic
But I'm clueless
My habbits are the cruelist
And love is not some item I can write on my to do list
And I am not some miracle that walks this lucky ground
Heaven knows that it's the other way around",https://genius.com/Watsky-lost-lyrics
Royal Fuckups,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"All my royal fuckups
All my royal fuckups
Don't let all the stuck up folks go keeping you down
All my royal fuckups
Come on let's get fucked up
All my royal fuckups
Rock your Burger King crown
You gotta grow the roots if you want the tree trunks
You want a garden then you gotta pull the weeds up
Look do you want to succeed?
Yeah I want to succeed but fuck it planting seeds sucks
From Brooklyn to Seattle
You want the cream, squeeze the udder on the cattle
I fell off of the horse so many times I'm thinking that some mother fucker must have spread some butter on the saddle
I'm getting battered when the ump is yelling batter up
Not jumping when the pitch is coming
But I didn't have a cup or grab my nuts and nobody would blame me if I emptied out my bladder like a baby babbling before this battle
I tried to storm the castle
I went to court, the judge he hit me with his gavel
So would you rather be up the creek without a oar
Or have somebody beat you with the paddle?

They say you fail a hundred times before you really win
And then you fail a hundred more before you will again
If that's true then I'm a diligent 1 in a million failure
I'm brilliant
I was a silly little freak
Didn't listen when the teacher told me not to speak
So she moved me and my desk out of the classroom and I sat out in the hallway for a week
I had to yell my name for roll call (Watsky!)
I tried to take it higher like a pole vault
In time all of my problems tend to snowball
But when I fall I can't be angry it's my own fault
So if they throw salt, they get a shake of pepper

Lucky,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's the end of a very long week I'm sitting in the 30th row of a 747 from Dallas to Los Angeles
The captain has signaled our final decent, my seat back has returned to the up right position, my tray table has been stowed
I'm finally going home
When a gurgle, under my seat buckle tells me that lunch is gearing up for a second appearance
A frantic search teaches me that DELTA airlines doesn't regularly restock seat pockets with sick bags, so I do the only thing logical I can think of, and try to Magyar my Sky Mall catalog into a make shift haversack
But before I can crease the outside edge, my body betrays me, which means that I'm sitting there, wearing my stomach acid as a loose tuxedo, while the entire plane including the hot girls across the aisle whisper and gag, necks crane as we make our torturous decent into LAX and as the entire air jumbo jet deplanes slowly around me
A thought crosses my mind, how do you not restock a plane with sick bags you INCOMPETENT AIRLINE, I'M GIVING MY PLASTIC WINGS BACK!
And then a second thought crosses my mind, I think this story is good enough for Cosmo, so lucky me for the life experience, lucky no one I know will have to find out about this, lucky the plane didn't crash, lucky for planes in the first place
I mean if I had thrown up on myself in a covered wagon, some settler would have been all like
""AYE! Aye we brocus, spocus, a mile back, and if you don't quit sulking and help pull us we might not be able to ford this river before night fall in which this cause you're going to smell mighty good to the Grizzlies.""
So lucky the atmosphere puts planes on its back
The airs so thick it bumps against out ears that's how we hear,lucky there's so much carbon around
Lucky for granite, granite has done big things for us, lucky conditions on this planet were perfect for live cocktail to turn a couple of atoms into a amoeba, into a cheetah, lucky that one monkey finally got his act together and turned into a dude
Don't forget the vocal chords, the lungs, lucky the opposable thumbs, the disposable mans, and the glands that's make lanolin that dismantle hand radios and bands that make videos for jams that witty oats to brands and lucky for that one reunion on Cape Cod where I first had to understand my fathers side of the family
Some say if you listen closely to those old wooden hallways you can hear the ghost of Woody Allen groaning at night
""I'm not dead yet you schmucks.""
The living, they gather around the dining room table, sharing, sharp class, saying lucky, lucky, lucky my ass
You calls this locks fresh water, salt water either you lie, the salmon so dry it must be the kind they catch in the sky
Oh Steven's health oh well yes they removed a tumour however that was the cancer's tumor, yeah cancers can grow tumors too smarty guy, doctor Rubén removed the cancer's tumor, the original cancer is now malignant in the skin cell, the couldn't tell his mole cause his misalignment stole the pigment and he looked like an albino with three shoulders he tried to dye himself back to normal in a bath of coca cola but now he's got dimentcha and he thinks he's Ale Roka, oui it savsha and degoya hey I can't complain he's better then Roderick forecasting rain. That's how they always end the story in my family, with I can't complain, grandma you just complained for 45 straight minutes without breathing or blinking, the nice girl is trying to take our drink order
If I could get a word in edge wise I'd say lucky the stomach flu, lucky that 2 month itch I'd rather not talk about, lucky because perfectly healthy is not a neutral state, perfectly healthy is a perpetual full body youforia but this is my fathers family and my complaining about their complaining is both concrete prove that in one of them an unfair generalization of a proud people
Take my dad, you know lucky he never caught a zip gun ricochet to the face but if you lean in you can see a little blue dimple on his chin from fourth grade sometime in the 1950s when trying to figure out how to get ink into a ball point pen, he accidentally slammed the Bic into his jaw tattooing himself for life and lucky he did cause that wasn't a ball point pen at all, it was a flag pole, ten year old Paul Merman Watsky was claiming that little patch of skin for himself and held his ground even as this unfamiliar man creeps up on 70 around him
I can see it in my dad's eyes every time he laughs at one of his own idiotic puns, everywhere he laments the over bearing Jewish mother that made him wanna tip out of his Manhattan apartment window like a potted plant, and lucky he backed away from the edge, and not lucky just because his reproductive equipment was the genetic heat of my eventual existence
But also because smiles are delinquent teenagers, they like to gather in large groups, they leave marks on the wall of your face to tell you of a life well lived, they're hard to get rid of but once they're gone you wonder why you pushed them away, you wonder into their dusty old rooms at night hold back tears at the edge of their bed and sit there rocking back and fourth thinking lucky the bend in your box bringed and sent two strong swimmers into the world as decent sons
So lucky San Francisco, lucky the lights over the harbor, lucky we're so young, both of us, dad because time is like a million mile wooden dock and we're at the very end, the very young end you're practically dangling our toes in the water, even if you're a hundred years old you're still dangling, and you'll shoot back, you're damn right I'm dangling, in all the wrong places
You're completely missing my point, because I just vomited in my lap in an overbooked jumbo jet, sitting here smelling extremely human but I still have my feet on the ground
So lucky we're not live stock, lucky we're programmed to think babies are cute, otherwise we'd probably ignore them and they'd crawl anomalously in large packs
America is a plump kid in husky overalls and I plan to live off the fat of the land, this country is a big cupcake straddling two oceans and lucky it wasn't me and you and someone had to fight and die so we could rot our teeth on the frosting, this planet is made mostly of carbon and Teflon and one day we'll slide off it like so much burnt stir fry, there's a lot that goes into a moss-covered rock, lucky there are so many cool bugs under them and it sucks that we eat a few by mistake at night but at least we don't crawl into spider's mouths while we're sleeping, a web of impossible coincidences has crystallized into this moment, look around you, history is a foot, this nights smells like no other ever had or ever quite will, so don't hold your nose when you walk past me
I just murmured myself to get everyone on this plane an amusing party story. So you better thank those lucky stars, all 3 hundred billion of them, lucky you, lucky me",https://genius.com/Watsky-lucky-lyrics
London Eclipse,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving
Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving

Breathing’s boring
What a stupid task it’s
Only 8 a.m. this train’s a moving casket
Brew it black and spike your coffee with your flask
Before you leave the house each day pull on your 'fuck you' mask
You know that sad disguise
You know that patch of lies
Commuters pull their papers wide so folks can’t catch their eyes
We let these years of tears build up and now it’s heavy stakes
And we might drown this city if we let these levees break
So I gotta get a grip
Show ‘em I won’t let it slip
I know that what’s done is done and so that’s why it’s dumb to trip
I’m not scratching at the walls, that’s London at my fingertips
They use the news from yesterday to wrap tomorrow’s fish and chips
So you can print me on pretty, colorful paper
Right next to the psycho bitch who allegedly stabbed her neighbor
And I’ll be looking back up atcha until you’re ready to crumple me up
Oh, oh, oh

Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving
Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving

At the last eclipse, I was living as a single man
My girl’s looking through a pinhole camera
That she made out of a Pringle’s can
Pointed upwards at a gray London sky, pretending she could see the sun (the sun)
And I’m really looking right at her thinking maybe she could be the one
We could run
New York, L.A., UK, what do you say
Got no plans
Got no faith
Another new sun, gonna bring a new day
I wait to queue for the Baker loo, then I take the tube
30 minutes heading to Kent
And I’m coming straight to you with a big bouquet
We’re not anchored
We got our freedom and we can wander any path that we wanna on the planet
Damn it we don’t even need a answer
And I’m looking at all the 9 to 5ers on the train
But all the 9 to 5ers on the train are lookin at your pretty faces
Lookin at the sun that only you can see up in the Evening Standard
This could be home to me
Home could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could be free
I’m happy with you
If you were somewhere new
Do you think you still could be happy with me?
Timing is key and our timing was keen
And time is as slow and so why should we baby
You make me weak in the knees
We could move every weekend but only if we can agree to where
Home could be anywhere
We could be anywhere
We could be free
I’m happy with you
If you were somewhere new
Do you think you still could be happy with me?
Timing is key and our timing was keen
And time is as slow and so why should we baby
You make me weak in the knees
We could move every weekend but only if we can agree to where

Come, the moon is over the sun
We’ll use the shadows to run
No one can stop us from leaving

We’ll use the shadows to run

Multiply,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"What am I made of?
As a whole?
Dirty hormones
Plus some flesh
Plus a soul
Times the times I floated times the times I sank
Times when I levitated times when I tanked
Times when I was more jackass than Steve-O
Times when I treated life like a TiVo
Napped all day to  skip through the weak shit
Knocked the half empty glass over and I spilled all my secrets
Times when I check myself as I grow older
Times when I broke my neck to cry on my own shoulder
Soaking wet, when I skip through the sprinklers
They tried to throw shade, but it slipped through their fingers
Times I got paid for the rhymes that I'm spitting
Times I got laid and really long times that I didn't
Times when I didn't fit and hid it behind obstacles
Times the ambulances times the hospitals
Stack it all, reduce the fractions, put that shit in brackets
Subtract any exaggerations I added, and there you have it, boys and girls. There's the path

Grey Eyes,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"Who should I believe? Please tell me why
No one saw what happened there that night
The only clue’s to look you in the eye
Those gray and cloudy eyes

All the people run and take a side
Don’t nobody want to break their stride
But what if we were to make a mistake
With stakes this high?
No one’s ever gonna truly heal
You want to gamble; who do you let deal?
Whose future rep do we ruin?
Let’s spin that roulette wheel!
It has never been a secret: cowards posin’ as leaders seek
To pervert their power and prey on the weak
But I also
Know
With an accusation, a wound is made
You wouldn’t be the first to wield a rumor
As a blade!
Fingers pointed like bayonets
What’s it cost you to make a threat?
Don’t be shy come on place your bet
If you roll snake eyes you don’t pay that debt
Let’s set it straight:
Only one things certain, that some… body is the serpent
And were… you to win that verdict
Slither out and take your curtain call
Lookin’ for a bit of mercy for she
Shoulderin’ a heavy burden with
Nothin’ but cursed choices
Silence is the worst of all

Who should I believe? Please tell me why
Know one saw what happened there that night
The only clue’s to look you in the eye

I do not share your load on this journey
I do not wear black robes in the court
So I will not bang the gavel; I won’t lock your shackles
This is not my trash to sort
Folks who think they’ve found truth tend to tremble
Any time the ground beneath them shakes
Find the closest rock to cling to
Lock your fingers into fissures where it breaks
But what if turns out things aren’t as we know ‘em
Reapin’ the harvest we’ve sown; Here in this garden of stone
What kind of hideous, selfish obsidian
Heart do I own?
Could you forgive me if my hesitation
Demands that you weather this hardship alone?
How could you pardon my tone?
I know that hatred can scar
That it can carve to the bone
So would somebody let me know how do we
Take shit back to when life was all wonderful?
Get to buildin’ a home or a chateau we
Can get comfortable feeling uncomfortable
I’m not talkin’ a Huxtable
What a difficult and retched affair
People seekin’ anything solid
To keep them from scratchin’ at air",https://genius.com/Watsky-grey-eyes-lyrics
Our Team,Oops! All Berries,2016.0,"I drive a blue car, a shitty little used car
And I won’t be in a new car until every one of you are
I’m in this Subaru just cruising with my dude shotty
Me and Chukwudi wiping boogers on your Bugatti
We bukkake your Bugatti with snot rockets
Do not knock it
My crew’s hotter than Hot Pockets
Man we’re some damn survivors
And someday we’ll be riding on albino Bengal tigers
We’ll be goin Platinum with no plateaus
You’ll be fittin cities in the shadow of our chateaus
And we will buy all the tacos, pools got all the grottos
Our autos got grottos
Glass bottom Benzes fuck you we got those
Backstroke to the trunk to duck the paparazzo
Or fuck it maybe not though
Either way I’ll roll with my muchachos
Before we fly into a rage
Try to keep a parakeet who’s wiser than its age
We’ll use our wings to bend the wires of the cage
My inky fingers kindling the fire on my page
We’ll keep it true and that’s a pinky fucking swear
Drink your blood but do it with a pinky in the air
Pinky and the brain
Kinky Jewish hair
And when we fall we’ll do it like a slinky on the stair
Jinky Scooby Doo, this dude’s the shit
I handle business while a doobie dangles from my lips
Hit an iceberg but we won’t abandon ship
While the Titanic’s sinking we’ll be dancing on the tip
And if they drop an anvil on our anthill
And we amble at our ankles bent at angles
We won’t trip
The Earth'll split because we're off the fucking Richter
We can turn a victim to a victor
Kudi’s been crashing in the backroom and he might freeze
Each night he realizes DVDs and Nikes
If you shuffle past the empty whip-it canisters, down the hall and up the stairs
And past the busted banister
D's pushing Cali but he says the high is heady
He mailed himself a couple of Os he sewed inside a teddy bear
I’m steady there in Max’s bedroom working on a dope banger
Rapping through some panty hose we stretched over a clothes hanger
And I’m still scraping bird shit off the merch box
Staying up in Super 8s and writing rhymes in Word docs
Cause nothing worth having works fast
And I’ll be riding coach until the whole squads in first class
If you can’t see it find your contacts
Play this verse in court and use it as a binding contract
Put it on my mom pact I won’t bitch and moan
I’d rather I’d be broke with the homies than rich alone
You can smell the excellence when one of us appears
It must be musty with the musk of all my Musketeers
So crack a couple beers
We’ll burn this sucker free
We take no fuckery
So you can raise your cup of cheer
We’re fucking durable
We’re sparklier than Charles Barkley’s head; you’re fucking turrible",https://genius.com/Watsky-our-team-lyrics

[Interview: Watsky & 
Justin Bieber

Hey! Justin! It's great to see you again, man!
What's up, how are you?
So, today...uh... We're going to talk about love
Is that cool to you?
I mean, I'm not -I'm not a expert about love or anything
I'm still learning, I'm still... trying to get the process
Well... When was the first time that you fell in love?
It was at, like, church
You fell in love with Jesus?
Uhh, no
Basically, this girl, who was dating this guy
But broke up with her so and she... I want to make her
'Cause she was lonely, ""one less lonely girl"", and da-da-da
And... yeah. Or in a car
Now see, I'm talking about love and you're talking about something carnal and raunchy
Uhm...
I mean, what is love to you? Why do you think that love is so special?
I think it feels good
You are so young...
Although I will say that I'm like...
Impressed and I don't really get how you find a time with your career
Um, what do you mean, like, when do I do it and when do I find time?
Like, I just do whenever I fit in space, but, like...
Oh, you're a quickies man
Yeah
Alright, back to the car story
This just feels so weird, we're in the back of a car, uhm....
So, so... At that point...
You're in control, but...
You have to make her feel like you're uncomfortable, because...
That's your image
I'm a beast. Sweat machine
And that's when you take your shirt off
This one in, I just want in's!
You just need practice
I mean, I'll go out with anyone I really fall in love with, I guess
You're... A bit of a tramp
Yes, you're gonna write single and write it mingle. Down there
I think you're going to be alright man
Yeah, I'm just looking forward to, uh, just...
Being successful in whatever I do

This... Is for those among us who got enough play
For twelve grades to carry on a upside down teaspoon
For every kid who could've counted their highschool
Hook ups on two hands tied behind their back
For every wall flower ""say on's"" master
With both palms on a crystal ball chanelling
The collective romantic prouds of Steve Urkel, Al Gore, Richard Simmons, Bill Gates and Screech
From ""Saved by The Bell"", this...
This is the anthem for those among us
Who got none in our formative years and this poem
Is for every high school virgin who wouldn't have had it any. Other. Way!",https://genius.com/Watsky-a-conversation-with-bieber-lyrics
A Kid Who Made Mad Beats,UnKnown,2018.0,"It’s the legend of the kid, start listening in
So many beats inside him that he couldn’t fit in his skin
Selekta with a deck better give him a spin
Nod you chin, baby grin, while you’re sipping a gin
Just vibe to his beats, don’t pick the punk route
Stick em in your ear holes, clean the gunk out
If you believe in heaven E’s up there dumb loud
Sitting on a cloud, with a rowdy ass crowd
Each beat oven-fresh, bish none repeats
One day he made like 50-leven-hundred beats
Made the beat dough and lined em up on cookie sheets
In neat rows and fed the people fifty-leven-hundred treats
Halfway cooks got half the cake
E’s got more cream than a calf could take
Some people just crafted to craft the break
And E crafts more breaks than God crafts lakes
And snakes and earthquakes, at faster rates
Makes more beats than teen kid masturbates
Grabs the crates, creates mad masterpieces
Maps to places that no path reaches
Homes for the nomad, my notepad screeches
Nose to the grindstone, there’s no bad peaches
Each is a butterfly chrysalis
I’m gonna go grab my headphones, it’s Christamis time

Cause' I knew a kid who made mad beats
Don’t get it twisted he had that heat
With the car speakers bumping, there’s no bad seats
Because I knew a kid who made mad beats
I said, I knew a kid who made mad beats
Don’t get it twisted he had that heat
With the car speakers bumping, there’s no bad seats
Because I knew a kid, I knew a kid

Beats are to E to the OM as me to a poem
Faux emcees don’t tread on this low-end
So, friend I’ll meet you on that golden road that’s got no end
Where we’re all going
We’ll smoke some shit with a mellow kick
Skip down the yellow brick, sip some Modelos
Spit a little literature like our lips were fitted a Brita filter
With some fine fellow
Pure— fucka no manure
While doodoo DJs smelling like an open sewer
You were spinning that potpourri
That Phonte, that Chron, that Jodeci
Jubilee in your town, jewels in your crown
School’s out now, come on hold us down
You got the sound, and we got the ears and such
And Wax got the dutch and the beers and such, come on

I knew a kid who made mad beats
Don’t get it twisted he had that heat
Car speakers bumping, there’s no bad seats
I said, I knew a kid who made mad beats
I knew a kid who made mad beats
Don’t get it twisted he had that heat
With the car speakers bumping, there’s no bad seats
Because I knew a kid who made mad beats
I said, I knew a kid who made mad beats
Don’t get it twisted he had that heat
With the car speakers bumping, there’s no bad seats
I said, I knew a kid who made mad beats

I lay low so these beasts won't
Pick their teeth with my bones

You can go where you want but you can't stay here

Somewhere i belong,"Grain 1​,​989​^​33",2019.0,"(Somewhere I belong)
Climbing and climbing not thinking about the crash
Jumping off of those towers
 and 
showing all of my ass
Honing all of my powers and spending all of this cash
It's like I'm trying to buy
(Somewhere I belong)
Riding in buses and busting all of these flows
Custom officer asking me what I do for my dough
When I know why I'm so self-conscious
It's like I'm trying to write
(Somewhere I belong)
Running city to city
And trying to outrun the blues
Picking buildings up at the corner looking under for clues
Building all of these castles
 and doing all that we can
'Till this rude ass universe ruins all of our plans
I say too fast
Baby let me off a carousel that's ruthless
Give me candy apple caramel
It's useless
Holding up all these fronts killing yourself for trying to do everything at once
But I guess that's just the world that we live in
Check the dead rats
Do we fight
Do we give in
Do we protest
Used to tell the kids that they should go West
Now a supermarket guru's selling no stress
But you know he popped a vessel in the process
What a whole mess
And yeah I'm naive
But I say why leave early
All that's guaranteed is going
(Somewhere I belong)

I Am Cupid,UnKnown,2004.0,"I am Cupid!
The Liaison of Love, the Constable of Crush, the Soldier of Swoon
I am Cupid
The nearly fully grown cherubic newly fully clothed angelic student of prudent lurid lust your parents warned you about
I am Cupid
The oh-so-subtle mafioso breaking into your heart, strapped with semi-automatic good intentions
Demanding ""show me some love or break yourself bitch!""
I am Cupid
The merciful mercenary burying card-carrying hatordate crusaders and Mc-dating, more outrageous than the latest pages on space invaders
I am Cupid
And I can do whatever the fuck I want
If I wanted to, I could shoot an arrow through the back of a man standing in front of a mirror
watch him fall in love with his own reflection and attempt to get with himself with a clear
Conscience- I could put some crystal on ice
Blast some Jill Scott at the White House at night
And hook John Ashcroft up with Condoleezza Rice
If I wanted to I could work things out with Justin and Britney and Bobby and Whitney
And if I couldn't find someone man enough for the Statue of Liberty I could break off the Washington Monument for her pleasure because after all a woman knows her own needs best
If I wanted to I could tell you why girls at dances wear uncomfortable stilettos they they'll take off in five mintutes
And how to bring up your unmentionables in a conversation without even mentioning them
I could tell all the guys why there are so many girls out there who want you as bad as you want their best friend
And I could tell you why all women, without exception make sweeping generalizations
I could cook up and hook up and look up the fate of a breakup and stake out a make out location in the case of a Casanova in over his head
I could if I wanted to, but forgive me the shit just seems a little trivial these days, I mean
The world as we know it is about to cave in on itself and I am wasting the almighty power of love on the heavy-hearted bourgeoisie?
It's 2004 I think it's high time for more goal-oriented Cupid
Cupid REMIX International Edition!
(singing)
Automatic, diplomatic- do what you do playa
Just keep some lovin' on your mind
I'm gonna shoot an arrow through Pakistan's heart and watch it go make out with India in the backseat of its Camaro
I'm gonna sprinkle love doses all over the Middle East and see Israel and Palestine moaning in the throes of passion on the West Bank
And I'm gonna teach the president to stop fucking the world over and show him how to make love
I want the USA and Iraq to rock to Rockin' the Casbah, giving each other rubdowns with calamine oil
No more deleting or creeping, no more cheating silently in pantomime on Middle Eastern allies claiming oil as an alibi
And I want to hear George W. Bush asking Saddam Hussein to be his Valentine
Don't say peace in the East is a fleeting mirage
I know Sweden be needing a Swedish massage
I see Eden right here and I'm fiendin the cause
by the evening I'm leaving to see that this heathen gets Ireland, England, and Whales to minage
Basically George Porgie's pushing for a diplomatic orgy
Uganda, Botswana, Guyana, Peru
Namibia, Libya, India too
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kirghiizistan, Kazakhstan tell 'em I'm comin' for you
I'm gonna get all the tanning oil and give the world a sensual full body massage
Dislodging misogyny causing a total global collage and going rope-a-dope on folks who go for broke on breaking hope and groping fraud
So Cupid just quit his deskjob, Bob
and this vigilante love god's marauding on uncharted ground
the standard rounds of applause lauded on liberally living the cause
Giving the flaws a bit of the credit of breaking the laws and giving me migraines my pain is the refrain of a symphony of sympathy sweeping the planet
Damnit I've got a blazing arrow and I'm not afraid to plant it right in your ass if you've got one ounce of anti-romantic Semitic semantics in you that you wanna pass off as true
If you're a threat to global harmony I'm comin' for you
Not to hurt you just to show you what some lovin' can do
The age of fighting is through, we'll be as close as superglue
If you get off your ass and show some goddamn love to Cupid too",https://genius.com/Watsky-i-am-cupid-annotated
Tiny Glowing Screens Part 2 (My Interpretation),UnKnown,UnKnown,"There’s 7 billion 46 million people on the planet
And most of us have the audacity to think we matter
Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who croaked?
Someone stabbed him in the heart, just a little poke
But he keeled over ‘cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
Hey, you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away?
He was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
He ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
And repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs 'til his last day
Hey, you hear the one about the fisherman who passed?
He didn’t jump off that ledge
He just stepped out into the air and pulled the ground up towards him really fast
Like he was pitching a line and went fishing for concrete
The earth is a drum and he’s hitting it on beat
The reason there’s smog in Los Angeles is ‘cause if we could see the stars
If we could see the context of the universe in which we exist
And we could see how small each one of us is
Against the vastness of what we don’t know
No one would ever audition for a McDonalds commercial again
And then where would we be?
No frozen dinners and no TV
And is that a world we want to text in?
Either someone just microwaved popcorn
Or I hear the sound of a thousand people pulling their heads out of their asses in rapid succession
The people are hunched over in Boston
They’re starting app stores and screen printing companies in San Francisco
They’re grinning in Los Angeles like they’ve got fishhooks in the corners of their mouth
But don’t paint me like the good guy ‘cause every time I write
I get to choose the angle that you view me and select the nicest light
You wouldn’t respect me if you heard the typewriter chatter tap tap
Tapping through my mind at night
The same stupid tape loop of old sitcom dialogue
And tattered memories of a girl I got to grind on in high school
Filed carefully on rice paper
My heart is a colored pencil
But my brain is an eraser
I don’t want a real girl, I want to trace her from a catalogue
Truth be told I’m unlikely to hold you down
'Cause my soul is a crowded subway train
And people keep deciding to get on the next one that rolls through town
I’m joining a false movement in San Francisco
I’m frowning and hunched over in Boston
I’m smiling in Los Angeles like I’ve got fishhooks in the corners of my mouth
And I’m celebrating on weekends
Because there are 7 billion 47 million people on the planet
And I have the audacity to think I matter
I know it’s a lie but I prefer it to the alternative
Because I’ve got a tourniquet tied at my elbow / I’ve got
A blunt wrap filled with compliments and I’m burnin it
You say to go to sleep but I been bouncing off my bedroom walls since I was hecka small
We’re every age at once and tucked inside ourselves like Russian nesting dolls
My mother is an 8 year old girl
My grandson is a 74 year old retiree whose kidneys just failed
And that’s the glue between me and you
That’s the screws and nails
We live in a house made of each other
And if that sounds strange that’s because it is
Someone, please freeze time so I can run around turning everyone’s pockets inside out
And remember, you didn’t see shit",https://genius.com/Watsky-tiny-glowing-screens-part-2-my-interpretation-annotated
