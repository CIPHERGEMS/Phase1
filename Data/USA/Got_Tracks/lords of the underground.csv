Chief Rocka,Here Come the Lords,1993.0,"Chief Rocka, Chief Rocka
Chief Rocka, Chief Rocka

Boom shaka laka, yo, here comes the Chief Rocka
Rock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca
For sharper type to battle make the people say ""Ooh ahh""
Think I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta
?Hey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because, I'm that type of guy
Now fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?
Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes?) It's gotta be the shoes!
'Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
So I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like ""Drum pan, a drum pan sound over some uuuuh""
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!""
C'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin' to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funky
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand
I'm the motherfuckin man
I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around
Let them know who wears the crown
Who's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funkee

The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka​

Well umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the fragrance, the funk
Whew, and it's smellin' up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe
I snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough
See, if I was an Indian I'd still be the chief
The only other difference—I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby, to the hibbidy
Hip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&B, ya see, all that's cool
But, hip-hop and rap, yeah, that's where my heart's at
Even back when, I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'
Before I had a record, I always kept 'em clappin'
Freestylin' on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin' in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit
Make you Jump like House of Pain
Boogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump
And remember, remember, Chief Rock I won't front

The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka
The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka

 Ay Mr. Funkee
 Whassup?
 Can I get assistance?
 For what?
 For what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut
Well back is the backer, I'm chillin' with my nucca
And if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like
 what goes up, must come down
 But not me clown
I cut 'em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin'
So jump in, and watch your ears start hummin'
Through the block, and don't forget to boom shak, shak-a-lak

Well damn DoItAll can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin'
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin'
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So now what do they say, when I'm walkin' up the block?
Boom-shaka-laka there goes the Chief Rocka",https://genius.com/Lords-of-the-underground-chief-rocka-lyrics
Neva Faded,Keepers of the Funk,1994.0,"In here we're the Lords of the Underground
Straight from Jersey
Kickin' nothin' but mad flavour
From the underground
And it goes a little something like this
For you punks
DoItAll neva faded
Supreme C neva faded
Funkyman neva faded
Lord Jazz neva faded
Marley Skills neva faded
DoItAll neva faded
Funkyman neva faded
So check out the styles we create

In this corner we got the brother with the braids in his hair
The real nigga with the ill grim reaper stare
5 feet 8 inches 210 pounds, kinda chunky
The brass monkey junky Mr. Funke
I'm tired of all these whack rappers Always Into Somethin'
You need to mind ya business, ain't nobody asked you nothing'
See I'm not getting' played by another mans greed
Don't take me for a chump, cause I'm not scared to bleed
I heard you say that Mr. Funke's gonna dis your ass
Let your boys gas you up and now they miss your ass
You're just mad cause you couldn't give the crowd what they want
Niggas lined up at my show like it's the first of the month
I got everything locked down in this area and I'm
Rippin' everything from Japan to America
Peace to ?Peter Beggar? you you got it goin' on
And I'm out (Why?) Cause I'm too sexy for this song

Marley Skills neva faded
Supreme C neva faded
Funkyman neva faded

Marley Skills neva faded
?Peter Beggar? neva faded
DoItAll neva faded
So check out the styles we created

Well you're lying boy cause I'm faded off the monk
But not off the emcees cause none of them can touch me
I squeeze my d with these ways of a key
And sometimes comes a verse that I usually sing like
I'm that brother straight from the under
My name is DoItAll but you can't be my lover
Well stop I'm not a rap singer, I'm a Hip Hopper
So y'all get the finger, special guests on my show
Is the nigga from my way
And I ain't changed my area it's still north NJ
I'm still from the bricks with the funkload of tricks
But I brought my man to flip that other Jersey script
Hence the parle with Marley to slap asses in the hallway
""Uh onetwo"" so let me hear you go HEY
So fuck what you heard cause this brother is absurd
?You cock like a doodle? and you mocking like a bird
I'm still that real nasty brother from the block of one nine
Who will gladly pay you Tuesday for some brass monkey wine
So uh wind it up, hah
Cause with one third of this funk you be poking out your eyes
I'm back on the stack of these fabulous raps
That I'm spiting real quickly ?then my teeth with gat?
I be the lord of the under, I go back to my roots
And if you don't know the bio, Chief Rocka was the proof

Supreme C neva faded
DoItAll neva faded
Marley Skills neva faded
Rated R neva faded
?Peter Beggar? neva faded
DoItAll neva faded
Lord Jazz neva faded
Supreme C neva faded
Special guest on my show, he can flow, he can flow
It's a brother on my show, he can flow, he can flow
Special guest on my show, he can flow, he can flow
It's my brother on the show, he can flow, he can flow

The way I be eatin' niggas up like Jaws
Scare you up until you bleed through your pores
Follow you home then I kick down your door
Run up on that ass, put your brains on the floor
Think about it before you step to me chief
Filled with grief and prepared for any beef
Much too high don't try to enter my mental state
I deflate any fat rhymes that you make
So break or get kicked like soccer
Missing like Hoffa or get broke off proper
A smooth move to you move like subtraction
Packin' a Mac 10, prepared for action
I represent the hostile and wild
A funky child, my style flow like the Nile
My mic is burning back up don't touch ya
I'll crush ya like the break down of Russia
Don't test the lyrical styles I possess
Protect your chest from the best with the vest
Schemeless cause many murders make a mess
It's the stress that got me bucking' like the west
Tell me who's next to move up and get bruised up
Mad crews that get choosed but won't move up
Listen and react to the man
Supreme C
And the C is for command
Flippin' the script like the script should be flipped
If I need protection, it's right on my hip
Boom bye bye ?oh I night?
Hear your Mums cry when you lie
In a casket covered from your head to your toe
Your body flow up like the smoke from the endo ay yo
Aight I kick flavor, wave ya pistols in the air, make a prayer
And just relax and sit back and listen to the way I react on the track

Tic Toc,Keepers of the Funk,1994.0,"Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)

Tic toc, this is how we rock
We're those same (um) brothers that brought you ""Chief Rocka""
Now, um, underground's my style
To this I have vows
And I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, N.W.K
Which is scarier
So if your on the deals
Who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off South Orange
On the block of one-nine
Of course, thirteenth ave
Is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
And to my 'hood give my heart
Cause without the heart
Then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
The park called ""the Corner""
Cause that's where the DoItAlldo was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
Cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
The 'hood was my savior
But now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)

Well, I be the funk-ular
Ultra-funk-ular
Gamma-funk-ular
Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm Hiroshima
When I die
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten
I'm like 100-5th-11
And sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
But if you ever try to diss the Lords, then it's on
Now I go on beat...
Off beat...
Then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme
And talk about your fat ugly mama (EEWWW!!)
M.C.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic
Is like Superman running to a phone booth
Straight from Martin Luther King Boulevard
In the heart of Newark, New Jersey
Make you say ""Lord have mercy""
If you step up in my face
Then it's do or die
And I'm gonna make you cry (waaahhhhh!!)

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)

Well, times have changed
Not only for the urban
But also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads
From the blonde hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter
As the clock winds down
With the tic and the toc
Because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
Say you sell out
Because you sell a million copies
And your tone goes BAAAAOOWW!
So do it for yourself
And do it for the 'hood
But do it from the heart
Cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
After the rappin'
When the clock ticks away
And ain't nothin' happenin'...

I remember way back in the days on my block
When the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
On Martin Luther King's boulevard
With P.C., wise, Easy Ed, and my brother hard Bernard
Used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
While I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the Shorty two MC's
The Educated Three
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
The fire still burns
Cause from the 'hood I came
And to the 'hood I must return

Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)",https://genius.com/Lords-of-the-underground-tic-toc-lyrics
What I’m After,Keepers of the Funk,1994.0,"That's what I'm after tell me what I'm after
 (
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum

That's what I'm after tell me what I'm after
 (
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
That's what I'm after tell me what I'm after
 (
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
That's what I'm after tell me what I'm after
 (
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
That's what I'm after

Once again it's the real ill microphone enhancer
Smoking MCs till I die from lung cancer
The mace is in my hand but I'm not afraid to shoot ya
Nobody can see me - 
I am the future
So you know that no one can ever hurt me
Because I'm ill (like what) like herpes
And I really don't give a damn who you are
Mr. Funky man all hail 
M R Funkular
Now in 1985 is when I first started to rock
Trying to do the human beatbox like
(BOOM HAH HAH BOOM BOOM HAH HAH)
All over the place shooting spit in your face
Then when the beatbox start play, that's when I started rocking
Mics, make you wack MCs wanna fight
Because they always tried to battle me to see who is the
Best
, 
so you know I have to roll on the quest
For what I'm after

(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
Hip hop and props that's what we're after
(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum

Stacks of those plaques - that's what we're after
(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
Hip hop and props that's what we're after
(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
Stacks of those plaques - that's what we're after

If it's hip hop that makes yo knees knock, turn us up box
I know you peep the sound, it's the Lords on the block
It's the list now this is how I live now, making people
Get down to my funky sound
Ever since I heard the sound I wanted to be down
Here's my demo tape won't you please pass it down?
So I can get paid and have things like I said
A car, a yacht, a house with a maid
But wow! Slow down, the party ain't that easy
Oh my god I think I let that video deceive me
No matter, as long as the rhymes are the phatter
I bet you billboard has me top of the ladder
Publishing like loving, I learned that from my cousin
Write your own tunes and you'll see thousands by the dozens
And after all that, if you gave back
All I want to see is the golden platinum plaque

(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
Hip hop and props that's what what we're after
(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum

Stacks of those plaques - that's what we're after

I'm after the gold then after that the platinum

Hip hop and props that's what what we're after
(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
Stacks of those plaques - that's what we're after


Now it's 1995 and I finally got my
Foot in the door, got props, I want more
Cause I'm definitely not where I used to be
But I'm nowhere near where I wanna be
I wanna be able to go out and buy a golf
Range and still walk away with change
Until then there's no time to be wasting
So I gotta keep on chasing, chasing

Well...
What I'm after - it's simple, come on and peep the mental
This ghetto born kid blowing up on instrumentals
What's the matter, oh I know you can't peep my pattern
My style is designed to shed light like a lantern
So click, click now the light's directly on your ear
If you peep the sound then run and tell a peer
What happened - did you get locked by my rapping?
You had to, cause gold and the plat is what I'm after

(
I'm after the gold then after that the platinum
)
Hip hop and props that's what we're after

Funky Child,Here Come the Lords,1993.0,"The year is 1971
Now comes the first of the children of LOTUG
Lords of the Underground, witness the birth of the funky child
Doitall, hit 'em!

Born with the fuckers from the womb of Brenda
She now likes the Lords but she used to dig the Spinners
First with the style from the birth canal
And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild
So dig it, wahh! Ooh, watch me dig it
I'm taking no shorts unless it's coming from a midget
I tax the peace more than chicken packs grease
I'm nearly knockin' boots, but if not, I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Ga ga, ooh, cries the baby
Smacked on the ass, now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles, or playpens, or crowds when I'm rappin'
And yes, I do reruns, as if this was What's Happening
Now January 14 has birthed the funk one
The B-Day for Dupree, and yes, I'm funky
I got you bobbin' to the funky style
K-Def, let 'em know here comes the funky child

Yeah... (laughs) born in the underground of Newark
Now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee

The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger
A.K. Anger, we told 'em Mr. Funkee Wallbanger
Conceived in the fire by a war through disasters
The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters
Mr. Funkee, yes, girl, the black mack is back
Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work day and night, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy
I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?!) Uncle (Who?!)
When I was young I used to sing with my sister
(Heyy)
Now I kick the ill styles, you have to call me mister
Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild
Raised in the ways of the funky child

Back up baby, here comes the stroller
We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' rolla
I'm caught in the swinging hypnotized by the Pendulum
Distributed by Elektra, so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic
Marley's on the mix, and now the Lords have a hit like POW!
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat...
...
Bring it back!
And go grab the album to bring the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say, ""Ain't they funky?""

We gone psycho and everbody thought we was DAS
It didn’t affect me, I said, ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on
(And it's on!)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say, ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's going out!""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off 'til the funky child returns",https://genius.com/Lords-of-the-underground-funky-child-lyrics
Here Come the Lords,Here Come the Lords,1993.0," Hey yo Funke wake up!
 Huh?
 Turn your radio up!
 What?!
 It's us!
 It's US?!
 Yeah listen to the cut!
It's our style!
 Our style?
 Your style
 Stop brother
 Aiyyo nigga wake up, ""let me show you some-thin!""
Listen to the way they flip the metaphors and phrases
Listen, listen, it's drivin me CRA-ZY
Cause everytime I do a style and flip it kind of simple
Brothers say, ""That's fat,"" and do it on the demo
From a demo to a promo now a hit on the radio
Next thing you know, they'll be doing our video
 Same one?
 Same one! Concepts, whole nine
And crazy similarities to the whole rhyme
I'm not worried though (why?) I'm flippin hits from the grill
And in the underground only real stays real, so umm
Check the skills, the skills are kinda ill and yo
Here Come the Lords, cause we're here to make a kill!
(Here Come the Lords) 7X
 Aiyyo, Marley!
 Aiyyo whassup knocka?
 Do you hear these suckas tryin to clock the Lord Chief Rocka
 Yeah I hear em, they're just a bunch of clones on your bone
 Hold up, I'm tryin to figure out where could they get my style from
Aiyyo wait a minute, remember the tape you shopped around a while back?
 Yo what, wasn't that your boys?
 Now they got our stuff down pat!
 Yo man don't sweat it, just show em why they call you Mr. Funke
Yo Lord Jazz, pass me some of that Brass Brass Monkey

Here Come the Lords, Here Come the Lords, Mr. Funke don't you see me?
I told you we were comin, you suckas didn't believe me
The Skipper, my Lords style stick like Jack the Ripper
I'm hangin other rappers like your girl hangs on my zipper
Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky
Stop being stingy knocka, pass that Brass Monkey
I step, off a stage, everyone knows, who I am
Grab the mic like Teddy Riley and I _Jam_ (chicka, aawww, Jam)
Give me the mic and watch me wax that ass *horn sample*
Keep the camera moving cause I'm kinda fast *horn sample*
You can trip, you can flip, you could even slip or dip
But you'll never ever rip, Funke style as good as this
Because you sound like you're drugged, you might as well be a singer
Your whimsy couldn't touch me if your name was Sticky Fingaz
So when I come around, don't try to be down, don't try to be down
Just dig the sound, cause here comes the Lords of the Underground
(Here Come the Lords) 7X

Well umm, open up the doors and yell, Here Come the Lords
Yell it loud yell it loud, let me hear it from a crowd
I packs em, _In the Closet_ like Michael Jackson
And love to hear the girls go OOH when I'm rockin
So catch it, no stutter in my flow but I wrecks it
And caught you on the dillz from my jam called _Check It_
Check it check it check it check it microphone check it
Yeah, you went wild, cause your moms digs my records
So come on, I'm takin you where the sun don't shine
The underground, but everything is fine
I rhyme, copacetic, unless it gets hectic
Your vocal chords'll get CRACKED, you gets no chloraseptic
So hit em, so chill, chill man chill
I know who used to be but now who's _Top Bill_
Well it's me, and yes, I am back by the Funke
Marley filled the House with Hits so you know The Lords are chunky
We stink, like pee-eww, funk from my shoe
But what about this funk, can two brothers like us do
But get down like James Brown and rock the whole town
Hah! And now The Lords have broke ground

Madd Skillz,Here Come the Lords,1993.0,"Before I start this jam
Hold up, let me tell you who I am
I'm Mr. Funkee
AKA The Motherfucking Man
That's right the man
Girlfriend got her knocked up
Big money clocker, Chief Rocka, boot knocker
MC's are on their knees, MC's I'm locking 'em in my trunk and
The Funk is no punk and I kick Donuts like Dunkin'
People scream ""Oooh aah"" because what the Lords did
I'm liver than 355 newborn kids
Then somebody tests me, there's guaranteed a trial
They gotta burn like the  to be half as good as I am
So bottom line look out for  and try to test me and
Funkee Man will walk all over your ass like a pedestrian
Not the type of kid that you get over on brother
You talk about me? I talk about your mother
No need to sweat a record, Funkee Man packs mad skills
I got a book of rhymes that stretch from here to the Catskill's
I guess you thought you scared me with your ass like hokey spooky
You need to get a Pamper, cause the stuff you wrote was dookie
I know that when you wanted to touch the vital part 
As soon as you open your mouth your breath starts stinking
Sorry you've been had, see my style is simply mad
If rap was parenthood, you might have to call me dad
Or grandpop, my  is crazy long and I'm
Hoping to make you part of this cause yo you ain't that fly
 {x4}
Mad skills, mad skills
Yeah you know we got 'em
Mad skills, mad skills
Yep, yep we got 'em

Oh my God, or my Lord
One stomp, two stomp
Chomp, chomp, chomp that's how I eat my comp'
DoItAll has got style so dig it, dig it
(DoItAll, DoItAll!)
What?
(Go 'head and kick it!)
I am what I am so I guess I'm just flam
And slam like lightening so I say ""Shazam""
I'm different
So don't compare me to another
But call an undertaker cause I'm burying motherfuckers
At hype shows, the beat rose from Check It to Psycho
You might wanna turn your head before I tug my nuts low
Last kid who stepped up, got strangled with the mic cord
(Haha, straighten that ass out like an ironing board)
Noooow, no no no, I'm not with the bullshit
DoItAll and Funkee Man come equipped
With the tech of my nine and nine mil' clip
But not from the barrel it's straight from the lips
So back up brother
My tongue is blasting
I'll eat that ass today and tomorrow I'm fasting
MC's can not see this, I'm like a chameleon
On a scale to one to ten I'm like a nine (million!)
They told you I was nice then they didn't tell no lies
I'm better with the mic than your grandma is with pies
Just hand me the mic, it's guaranteed that I will rock it
I got so many skills that they're falling out my pocket


If stepping to us is wrong then I don't know what y'all be thinking

They call me Mr. Funkee Man but you're the one who's stinking

Then talk behind our back like you're better than somebody

But yo man when I catch you, I hope you know karate
Or Tae Kwon Do or Judo
Kick boxing or Jujitsu
You better learn something quick cause Funkee's coming to get you
I swan kick Bruce Lee and slam Lex Luger
MC's are scared of me so they should call me Funkee Kruger

Noooow I'm the rapper assuming to give them daily allowances
If rap was body weight you'd weigh like two pounds, three ounces

What ya needed?
I'm undefeated
What you expect?

So many titles under my belt I gotta wear it on my neck",https://genius.com/Lords-of-the-underground-madd-skillz-lyrics
Psycho,Here Come the Lords,1993.0,"Psycho... (x12)

Excuse me, Mr. Funky man (Yes, DoItAll)
Can I take the stand and slam like Bam Bam ? (like who ?)
Like Bam Bam that kid from Bedrock
And don't turn around 'cause you might get popped
Uh one-two, microphone check from the mid-brain
This time the ruckus from my brother who's insane
Strictly one then two then to the corners
Break down the alley just to jing another hit !
Freestyle's stepping but free cut too frequently
Rhymes that bring it back soon or immediately
My force is strong, like Obi Wan Kenobi
Some don't believe so now I had to show these styles
The difference, the force, the pattern
Just another brother know what's happening
I'm strong, with the strength of King Kong
I can slam an MC from here to Hong Kong
Like Ding Dong can bell his gong
Without a hammer
I drop slang like shit in a Pamper
Then collect props here 'til I touch it
Hang some to Funky man and you'll get snuffed
I'm psycho ! (psycho, psycho, psycho...)

Excuse me DoItAll  (Yes Mr. Funky man)
Can I step on to the plate and smack this great slam ? (Like where?)
Like last field past the shortstop
Yeah, step back and let the Funky man drop
I don't have it all
So wiggle the microphone  normal
Act like you know it then don't treated like a homo
Stop acting bad boy thinking you can hack it
Come on you must be crazy
Pull his ass in a straight jacket
Funky man's style go wild rhythms let the Funky man flow
 and I'ma jump up and hurt another rapper or singer
You touch the microphone I'ma break your fucking fingers !
Like I said you get rolled like a sneaker and back of me all you see is broken minds that are blowing speakers
So now, I grab the microphone and wreck wild !
Treat that ass lovely and spank it like my child
Follow the rules and get hung like a hanger hit my head on the wall they call me Funky wall banger
MCs try to be down, yo I do them like Homey the clown
One 
'cause I'm psycho ! (psycho, psycho, psycho...)

Well, I'm nuts
A straight up maniac, so call me psycho
Do you have static ?
Yes, so get the rifle
To kill 'em, smoke 'em, oops, I meant choke 'em
With the cord of my mic, and watch his head start floating like boom
Just hit the flip BOOM BANG !
I have more ammo than Saddam Hussein
Well I'm not playing with a toter my mom was gone like missing
So now it's time for the Funky man to start dissing other rappers
Who couldn't penetrate as if they're crazy
Pumpin' out quick shit but now yo it don't face me
So hit the showers, I rock more with mad hours never more will I snap shit
'cause yo, I got the power like He-Man, see man, yo what's it gonna be man
Rock some more ill shit, I make it sound like D-Man
Psycho, psycho, psycho...

Lo-Lo-Lord of the Underground they're getting psycho

My mind is flipped or should I say twisted
Like Cypress Hill ""damn, was I  ?""
I got you wonderin' and thinkin' and fumblin'
Instead of tuttering now you're mumbling
I'm on the X that's thin like glass
So fear the wrath of the psychopath
I'm really bugging 'cause my nuts 
I think I'm worst than a pigeon that flu the coop
I'm about to flip think I'm going psycho
Psycho, psycho, like my man Michael Myers
I'm in time to pass out the flyers
MCs retire or burn in the fire
I think I'm going crazy
Oh I mean crazy yo
MADD SKILLZ MADD SKILLZ
Funky man chill !
Watch the Funky child now the kid gone wild
The Lords are leaving foul, psycho style

Keep it underground
Keep keep it underground

I have an underground contract
(With who?)
My music
To freak it, freak it, and it like they used ta
So here it is, the real for the rugged
And let ? say, ""I wonder how he does it?""
Well, say and simple
I wreck an instrumental
And ring your damn ear drums as if I was a cymbal
Like RING
Watch the Do It All do his thing
I might pack the verse but the verse won't sing
See, now I'm off my rock
I think I need a doc
But I don't need a camera unless they take me pop
So, um, dig it
Watch the Jersey boy, um, kick it
And unplug this jam if you're feelin' kind of timid
So here we go
Long live the flow
And I know you hear the rap with 'em
Catch me at a show
And um
Get down, no matter how it sounds
The Lords, The Lords
You gotta keep it underground

Keep it underground
Keep keep it underground

Check it check it uugh
Watch me make it funky for your town
Check check check it out
Watch me check check my style
I stink
People think I sleep with a skunk
Cause I open up my throat
Then I give you all the funk
All you rappers on my tip
You know you need to get off
You try to disrespect me
I try to knock your head off
So get ready for the real hard rhymer
Save the drama
I'm eatin' other rappers like Jeffery Dahmer
You get two smacks for thinkin' I'm a new jack
Like Kid Capri said, ""The joke is on you jack!""
Cause if another steps to the bad brother
I strike you like your father, word to the mother
You suckers might as well get lost
Cause I'm the boss
You'll catch a three piece, with biscuits and extra sauce
This time around
I caught you with your pants down
Now pull your drawers up
And keep it underground

Keep it underground
Keep keep it underground

Mr. Funkee have to get hard on this record
To show you I can even switch styles and still wreck it
The Lords Of The Underground
The ones who hold the crown
Whoever told you we was wack
Really didn't know what they was talkin' bout
You're jealous of my crew
The news is that you're sweatin' me
Get off my tip and find something else to do
Now come on now, how you figure?
If Marley didn't think that we was dope
Then I guess we wouldn't be here nigga
And you can even check my album, All G Funk
Leave a bunch of girls singin', talkin' bout ohh la la ohh la la
But some of these rappers are DEAD WRONG
Pick up their albums
And you hear somebody sing on every other song

So let it come from your heart
And let it flow through your veins
And the streets
Will definitely scream your name
Peace to the Ice Cube and peace to the Kool G
You only get your props if you come from beneath
Now the 
Hit Squad
 GETS PROPS
And um, Cypress Hill GETS PROPS
And um, PM Dawn DOES NOT
Now um, 
Naughty By Nature
 GETS PROPS
And The 
Geto Boys
 GETS PROPS
But Me Phi Me DOES NOT
Now back to the sound
The wrecks your whole town
And like the jam says

So call the traffic control to know which way to go

Praise the Lords everyday, not one day
Amen, Amen
Go ahead and get to it

I got the skills that's packed and piles of stacks
And if you're wonderin', they're labeled rough raps
I give it up or should I say I gave it
So don't try to play me cause I'm not the one to play with it
I hit the skins in all types of fashion
Treat it like a sport and call the sport ass crashin'
And on the mic with the port that had a SHORT!
And ripped it down with my mad train of THOUGHT!
I'm overflowin' with skill pops and peas
So when you hear that I rap, oh Doitall please

Let your right brain focus on the beat
Then the left pick up the vocals on a different type frequency

Don't get nervous, cause it's easy, for real do'

For those who want work I get up in ya like a tampon
I know you like to hear that rated R rough shit
So I came equipped with the rhymes that don't slip
They keep comin' and comin' just like an orgasm
I feel gratification, sation when I'm grabbin'
A microphone, check one, check the two to three
Check the S.A.H. dash and check the B
You probably didn't know a female could flow as hard as this
Did I show and prove or do you wanna hear this?
As I get props
Spank and rip shop, suckers get dropped, they can't fuck with the hip hop
And how about I go break it on this part of the rhyme
Slam the track, stop the rappin' and whine, whine, whine

And stayin' crazy paid comes natural
Time to buckwild wild like the Dirty Dozen

Oh yeah, I brought my cousin
Jam-C
That's right we're livin' larger than the humans
So come on, join the funk family reunion
I'm straight from Newark, New Jersey but go where ever I go
I know
I'm knockin' niggas out like Ivan Drago
I like to spread the funk around the block where I stay on
That's why it stinks around Bergen and Avon
See once I grab the mic, guaranteed satisfaction
Make you wanna scream, ""HEEHEE"", like Michael Jackson
I'm blessed by the funkafied child
(YO FUNKEE KICK YOUR STYLE!)
Yo hold up, wait, not now
I like the way the skunk smell, I like to freak the funk realm
Any rapper think he's takin' mine, he's drunk as hell
So check the funky horn cause I got it goin' on
Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan, let me rock it Chaka Khan
Yo this is dedicated to the punks talkin' about they from the underground
Come on now how that sound?
You see, I don't give a damn if you're underground or (NOT!)
I hit hard like a (ROCK!)
Then start handin' out the (KNOTS!)

This is my jungle you won't enter, (WHY?!)
Lions and tigers and bears oh my

Can I can I get an amen
He opened the door, that's when Jam-C came in
Bringin' the shit like interjections used today
Like, ""Yikes"" ""Shock"" ""Scared"" ""Heavy"" (""HEY!"")
I'm black watch, with a leather band, not 
X-Clan
I'm bringin' the wind and tearin' shit like Rodan
I'm not into wrestlin' but I headline any sound with twelve techniques
I proceed to break it down

""Comin' live from The Bricks""
""From Newark, New Jersey"" - Redman on EPMD's 'Hardcore'
 
Well I step through The Bricks on the streets of concrete
Poundin' on the pavement as my speech freaks my statements
Pourin' on the block where I used to tick and pop
Now I'm all hooked in this stuff called (HIP HOP!)
The flow I kick is wicked, so please don't try to dig it
I might give a little, but only take a smidgen
My style is kinda different
I freak it with the gift and
You'll only freak the style if you live in The Bricks and
Born
Born and raised since I was little
I now freak a rhyme but used to freak a riddle like:
What has legs and uh, what has arms?
And who has skills to freak it in a song?
Well um, ding dong, X marks the spot cause it's me hops
I now freak the style from my Newark, NJ spot
Mr. Funkee
(WHAT?!)
Jam
(WHAT?!)
Can I kick my shit?
(YOU KICK IT IN HER BUTT!)
Well um, god damn, now the shits on my Timberlands
I stepped in the funk cause I kicked it in her can
Like, eww, nasty, stinky, smelly
Now I'm on the way and I'm stompin' on your belly
South Orange Ave is in the house
(UHH!)
Avon Ave is in the house
(UHH!)
Hawthorne Ave is in the house
(UHH!)
Clint Street is in the house
(UHH!)
And The Bully is in the house
(UHH!)
Clinton Ave is in the house
I got a hoodie
Black is the color when I'm stompin'
So Marley keep it pumpin' and I'mma keep it bumpin'

In the mix, from The House Of Hits

Faith,Keepers of the Funk,1994.0,"Keep the faith (4x)
 
It's been 21 years since I rose from the crotch
Now that I'm grown I just sit back and watch
Been almost 2 years since I dropped my first jam
You still don't give me props but hey I understand
You do what you got to keep from sinkin' in the sand
Nowadays everybody wants to be the man
Whenever I'm around you put up a front and shake my hand
Smilin' in my face but can't wait to take my place
So you can all be jealous but learn some control
Be a man about it if you're a swole say you're swole
Cause though you don't respect me you can never break my heart
Because I kept the faith and stayed true to the art
:
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me

I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me

 :
Well here's the jeep banger of the year
I'm on another level but I still hang with my peers
I got a couple of friends but why are they friends?
Is it cause I hip hop and now I got ends?
Although it used to be hard, it's easy for the skins
Because I'm making music and I'm settin' mad trends
Now it's got me wonderin' thinkin to myself
""Will they be there when I'm knocked off the shelf?""
Cause people come around only when you're doin' well
Or when they try to pull you down by tuggin' on your tail
So what the hell?
(You got the faith)
So if you tryin' to pull us down
Well boy I swear it's too late
Cause I got assistance beyond dissin' sistas
And yeah you can hear it when it's blastin' in the system
My lyrical is spiritual so don't get hysterical
Cause when I'm doing well boy it ain't no miracle
It's the faith
:
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me

I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me
Believe me

 :
Now as the world play this game of ring around the rosy
You find a lot of jealous people always being nosy
I try to stay away from all you scandalous snakes in the grass
That's always in your ass
All up in my biz like ""Yo, how can I be down?""
Leave me alone and stop jockin' me clown
When I was dead broke you wouldn't have nothin' to do with me
But now all of a sudden yo you wanna crack a brew with me?
:
Never did I think about the worth of my birth
Not until now, it took my man to get hurt
So Jazz tell me do you feel the struggle?
(I feel the struggle)
So oooh I guess I flow with the notes
I'm doin what I'm doin and I'm doin this for you
And with this in mind, see I won't stop pursue
The credibility and the originality
You know the type of stuff that takes me to the t.o.p?

He won't deceive me, believe me
I place all my faith in God cause God will never leave me

We are, gathered here today. To say goodbye to the dearly de-parted

Yo he was bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
He was bound to dig his grave
 
You pushed up daisy's more than once in your life
You might as well meow because you played your nine lives
So here's a shovel
Dig like a digger
And don't shoot your yaps cause I might pull the trigger
I seen it happen to a brother who was rappin'
Frontin' real fat, and kept a crowd clappin'
But now he's loose, lost all his juice
Once a big star now his necks in a noose
He couldn't hack it
The fame and the glory
He popped a lot of shit, but that's another story
I mean he blew up, there wasn't nothin' he couldn't do
The only problem now is that his head blew up too
Once platinum and now he can't sell a tune
I wonder how it feels to have your life go ""Kaboom""
Reminiscin' how it was back in the days
Before the front
When his records got airplay
Started off hard
Ended up soft
You should of stayed street till you paid your cost
My record company can kiss
My manager can lick
And my boys...can get my dilznick
Now that's the attitude you love and you live by
You used to eat steaks now you're beggin' for a french fry
You didn't know but I already figured
That one day someday
Bound to be a grave digga

Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to dig his grave
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga

Yo, he was bound to dig his grave
 
You're Mr. Grave Digga, your mind is like a shovel
Every time I turn around it's diggin' you deeper into trouble
I don't understand some of the stuff that you do kid
Tryin' to get yours, makin' moves that are stupid
You see life is like one big comedian
Who's tryin' to make you laugh but you still don't know the half
Everyday, all day, you got's to learn the hard way
(You'll never play me)
Yeah, that's what they all say
You play the tough role as if you are thorough
(I'm the mack baby. A king like a pharaoh)
At least you thought you were until you met this girl that you wanted to be your queen
Now you find out what I mean
You push up because you really want the lay
Down to one knee cause you ain't too proud to beg
She kicks it back and everything goes swell
Next thing you know you're in the back of a hotel
You're ready to hit the skins and everything is gettin' hectic
So you start your tactics without a prophylactic
Ooooh
It's too late to cry now
She was livin' foul, you can kiss your ass goodbye now
She had A.I.D.S, you ready made a blunder
(Down with O.P.P.!)
Now you're down six feet under
All just because you had a girl that wanted to stick ya
Give this man a shovel, make way for the grave digga

Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to dig his grave
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Bound to be a grave digga
Yo, he was bound to dig his grave
 
I take walks through my underground graveyard
Jumpin' over tombstones of those who are hard
You picked your casket by givin' out ass kicks
To those who didn't know about my ghetto tactics
You stuck and robbed, cause that's the way you live
And once in a shootout you caught a little kid
Look out my window saw you pimpin' through my area
Real hard
And makin' people scared of ya
But there was one who was simply not havin' it
Pulled out a shank and cold started stabbin' ya
And now you wanna change the way you were livin'
Shoulda, coulda, woulda
But ya didn't

Think about how many lives could be saved
If people would behave instead dig their own graves
I try to sit you down, listen child, let me tell you now
But you're livin' foul
That's why you're where you're at now
So there you have it
You're just another name
In the Ain't-That-A-Shame Grave Digga Hall Of Fame
One day you're rich, next you're beggin' for a quarter
Don't you know your mouth gets you in hot water?
There's one thing that I have to say to you
Watch what you say don't watch what you do
Cause if you don't then you'll be just like the next nigga
(How you livin' huh?)

Keepers of the Funk,Keepers of the Funk,1994.0,"Everybody funky but they don't know how
Let the Lords of the Underground show you how
Everybody funk and they don't know how
Let the Lords of the Underground show you how

Well I was born in the year of the black ??? shoe
When my mom did the Whomp in the bellbottom Zooks
Now I'm picking at my 'fro, so you better beware
Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care
Well I'm whoops-a-daisy, my parents had a funk baby
Now I am an addict, and that's just got me crazy
Sending ???
And nothing but the rhymes trying to ???

Now everybody want to be a funk-ateer
But don't know how ??? funk rip the ???
So check it, now I got it locked on the record
And if you go and get it, I bet you won't regret it
So peep it, just like the joint ??? did
A rebel for that funk, and that's how I keep it

I'll be the keeper of the funk, they know just who I am (X4)
Cause I'm coming with that funk like I just don't care
(Repeat X2)

All hail gamma funkular
I can't wait to get on stage, grab the mic, and show my ass
And if the girl is on my tip, then check her
I ain't joking,cause if i get it in my clip I'm stroking
I mean come on now, half of ya'll don't really know what drama is (yea)
You know you ain't half the man your mama is


Now when the mothership landed, even though not on a planet
I still felt that vibe, that's why I feel like slammin'
So here, take a little bit, mix the funk with scripture

Lords Prayer,Here Come the Lords,1993.0,"Amen! Oops, I meant three men!
Here to raise the underground the way it should've been
But not to rock gospel or to sound hostile
But glad I seen the light before I wound up as a fossil
But this ain't church because my song is kind of different
And if you feel the music I can tell you feel the spirit
So swing the tambourine as I take you to a scene
Of the underground - know what I mean?
So this here's my anthem, sort of light my national
And people still say it from the streets to the classroom
I don't believe it! Well glory hallelujah!
And it's cause I got to get funky like tuna
I'm not a Muslim or Christian or Baptist
But yo I give thanks if you listen to me rap this
Now who's the reverend? That's the next question
My moms, my grams and, uh, my mother's husband
Now Funke Man's my deacon cause he backs me while I'm speaking
And Jazz is the pastor cause he mixed the crazy beats and, uh
My congregation backs me like a choir
Precious Lord! And then we were hired to
Freak the underground and bring back the Hip-Hop on a
Peaceful journey like ""Hey, baby won't stop""
So where you worship? A chapel in a small town?
No matter what I plays God in the underground

(?) is here! Bow your heads for the prayer!

Kumbaya my lord! What?
My lord! What? My lord!
While I do my thing, while you sing!
Kumbaya my Lord! Kumbaya!
Now chill, watch me wreck this!
Now in my underground there's no (?) or baptism
Punk emcees? I dismiss them with my rhythmic exorcism
Lord Jazz! Hit me one time for the deacon!
I want to give a sermon but my beeper keeps on beeping!
So DoItAll, step into the (?)
While I get to a prayer so I can see who's trying to reach me

Why should I front like he's hard when he's cotton?
Why should I front like he's fresh when he's rotten?
Why should I front like he's down when he's not?
Why should I front underground when it's pop?

I write more lyrics on the scroll and more (?)
I (?) my 40 runneth over
(?) wackness
I should deny the brother cause these brothers need practice
And I should set a table in the presence of my brothers
(?) whether I'm wrong or right, I put no one above us
Between us there's a rhyme that no one could ever summon
And I should dwell in the underground for ever
To interrupt my sermon is really kind of bold
So may the good lords have mercy on your soul

(?) is here! Bow your heads for the prayer!
(?) is here! Bow your heads for the prayer!

Little Jimmy Swaggart was sitting in a tree

Jimmy (?) was rich but Jimmy (?) went crazy

Now you understand! Now you understand!
How people go to church in the underground land
Why? 
Cause your modern day religion is busted!
The preacher is a thief and the others can't be trusted!
They walk around the church, collecting all your dough
Where will the buck stop? Nobody knows!
It's (?) to gamble - oh ain't that a pity!
What's up with all the bus rides? You know, Atlantic city?

 the jackpot -

By the way, by the way, you just hit the jackpot!
What are you going to do next?
Well, I'm going to the promise land in my brand new Cadillac!

So don't get mad if we don't (?)
We might appear against the church, but that's not what I'm saying
And if you think we're fighting, you might just need to take a second look
You never know, your preacher just might be a crook

Steam From da Knot,Keepers of the Funk,1994,"Verse One:
Well, I'm gonna creep through your area with steps that are slowly
Camoflauged and in black so niggas they don't know that
While niggas givin hi's I'm givin goodbye's
I'm still shooting persons out the corners of my eyes
But brothers know nothin and ain't seen nothin
But best yet the fest when I leave knots in their stomachs
So who wanna have a little shindig with me?
Well, bro, you got it, until the return of Funky
Cuz I'm that brother who was born in the under
And if you don't believe that then go ask my mutha
Cuz when it gets hot I ignite what I got
Just to let you know that I blow up the spot

Verse 2:
I have an attitude that's shitty but don't need no pity
Cuz all I wanna do is get down to the nitty
So watch every move as I step up on this groove
My voice is filled with madness, and not ment to sooth
Say the name Doitall, say it backwards 
Say it one more time and I'll appear by your side
My voice'll drop a measure and your ears'll feel the pleasure
You'll here my tongue lashing because my tongue is like leather
Now I be from the land where the crooks be grand
And the boys grow up to be the Stickyfinger man
Now I got you straight from the block known to rock you
But just like I got you some day you want the Do
I smell a sniff, can it be the Funkyman approachin?
Well I'mma keep roastin on behalf of the Lords
I swear to my G, I have unity, my crew have unity and this is me
Now who be I when I be that fly guy from NJ?
Some say Doitall, but my real name is Dupre
The ghetto type heart is sparked by the horror
I creep at the corner while you search for tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, they love me tomorrow
Words I usually hear cuz I have hip-hop by the collar
Underground the meaning: below, beneath
That's what they think of us rhymin on these beats
Rap music - can't hear it, peep it, or speak it
That's why a Grammy, I'll probably never see it
So who in the public does the Doitall trust?
The Lords, the Lord, until my heart busts
So remember, L.O.T.U.G. is forever
You dis one, you dis the other
You dis the other, you dis the under
And you don't ever wanna dis the under",https://genius.com/Lords-of-the-underground-steam-from-da-knot-lyrics

I am a Lord Mc, yeah you know me
Brown ass nigga zig-zags from Jersey
When yo' system knocks, better be Lords on the box
Watch ya spot, we Set It like Vivica Fox
You know I be ridin in eighty-fitty-I wit Sha
While we umm * inhales * on lye
And when it's trouble, we push the Black Lex bubble
Me and Cappo, push the whip REAL SLOW
Tinted windows, so nobody know
Lord of Undo', translates to below
Feel the flow, cause we blow like so
Eatin NoDoz, quick to kick like bolo
You know, the way we go, you betta follow
Six-double-oh travel roads that's narrow
Watch your body, feel it twist like karate
Take dat, feel dat, it's enough for everybody

Check it - a hum dullah don't deserve to be a star
DoItAll, Lord Jazz, Funk Man, yo who we are - Lords
Immacular, push the black Lex car
Hang you off the balcony -- now my office hours are..
The rap game is full of wannabees who ain't nice
I get up in it, cook niggas in a minute like rice
Rock a lot of ice! Keep the girls lookin at me funny
Tryin to get pregnant, tryin to get some money
But you must be crazy if you think we havin that
I've got lawyers that could prove that the Earth's still flat
Fools wanna stress me, but I can raise the mackin out
Got the Lex off the lot, make the owner back it out
What, L (L), O (O), T-U-G (G)
Livin like kings, gotta push the big Jeep
Take trips to Hong Kong, backstage at a show
With some Chinese broad named -- Sum Dum Ho -- what?
Chorus: repeat 2X
Take dat, yeah nigga take dat
Feel dat.. ""Take that take that take that"" -] Puff Daddy

What the deal is? You see my jewels be the chillest
I be the illest, me and Lords, back with real shit
Hip shit, Hop shit, freak any topic
Knock it? Stop it, niggas didn't lock this
It's Resurrection Dun-Dun, frequently let one
BLAOW from the big gun, make the whole crowd run
Ask Sun, come on down and hit me one
Break me off one, come and get some

Who wan' come test, take it to your chest
Put a bullet in your Bubblegoose like Wyclef
Funk Man got these rap cats jealous of me
Like Joe Frazier jealous of Muhammad Ali
But can't nobody touch this, far as I can see
If you don't want beef, you gotta give it to me
The Jim Carrey of this rap shit, makin niggas laugh
At you dirty MC's, need to go and take a bath, uhh

Take a seat'n, ain't no competin
Me and Lord Jizzy, Funk Man ain't retreatin
Disbelievin, might end all your breathin
Catch me on the weekend, black Jeep creepin
Thug niggas love niggas, who bust niggas
So bust this niggas, pass the lime liquor
I'm quicker, than your average umm type niggas
Take dat, take dis, this for you niggas!

Take dat, Put It In Your Mouth like Akinyele
The style that I kick make all MC's jeally
The bone-crusher, rock the microphone from here to Russia
Leave dents instead of fingerprints when I touch ya
Efficiently declared illegal by the government
Kidnap your mother make you wonder where your brother went
My crew, retaliate like Benny Blanco
Make my getaway, in a stolen White Bronco

Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Hey yo funke pack your bags once again, it's on
Off on the road again, more like home
Now make sure you pack a bag with the cappa rats
And a head full of freestyles to prove it ain't a whack
We're headin to the venues across the nation
Due to last album's underground sensation
Survive with the vibe what you feel inside
Is it real? (It's real!) well then let it ride
With the funk, still got that funk, always got the funk cause I know it's what ya want, um I
Speak to my peeps with the beats from the streets
I guess when on the road that's why they cling to our meats
The girls be jackin', the guys be watchin, but no it's not The Lords, it's the hype they're clockin'
Weave our Glocks with hip-hop, so watch as they
They know we don't care if they're ready or not
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)

When I'm pink in the bird do ya know I rocka socka .. MCs
You know I'm not havin it, my skills are well crafted
My bounce to the ounce, my bounce in the mattress
So catch me I'm leakin', and not when I'm thinkin, cuz when caught with thinkin, I can catch up yer sneakin
So back to the deala, the lord's a mag dealer and the rope is equipped with tips to get familiar so I'm never neglectin it even though it's hectic, it's something I love that's why I'm always struttin
So I step to the comas,  my pace is
Just to get away from those who press my luck
Here's the back monkey let me get the microphone it's time to go again
Mr. Funkyman, ? is on the bird again
That's right so have no fear
Lords of the Underground are here, put your hands in the air
And let me drop the microphone and kick the funky sound
I'm out to make you party like its 1999
Check it ass out make it funky for ya
Step to the rear if you're hip to see the point
Jackson, underground, shit was full of action
Give them nothing but the facts and hear me keep ya satisfaction
I rock it till the mic gets hot, ready or not, let me show you what I got no stop
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not (steppin on yo face)
You just don't understand what it takes to make the Lords of the Under
How we're keepin hope alive sometimes it makes me wonder
Where in the world did I ever get the courage
To step onstage and send the crowd into a rage
I say the rhythm comin that's when I commence the rotten
When I move across the stage, it can look as if I'm plottin
With my funk on, you put the funk on? I got to get my funk on. You gotta put your funk on
I never been one to be jealous of what another man has
I learn my own business and wash my own hands
I never call girls hoes and bitches when I'm rapping
Cuz I'd rather not talk about it manage to survive without it
To tell the truth, I got to much on my mind
To waste my time just attack the women when I rhyme
Either way the lord's house is gonna stack
This hour will be fat, remember we'll be back
