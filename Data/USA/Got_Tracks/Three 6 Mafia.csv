Sippin’ on Some Syrup,"When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1",2000.0,"(Triple Six!)
You ol' pussy-ass, cake-ass, punk-ass, trick-ass, sucker-ass
Fuck-ass, dick-in-the-booty-ass, K-Y Jelly-packing-ass nigga
Smoke something, bitch
You better get your bitch ass up off the street, nigga
You got five seconds to get your hating ass up outta here
Pouring up and showing up, bitch
Cause it's some trill-ass niggas in this motherfucker
Yeah, nigga, y'all know the motherfucking sco'
Y'all non-snorters, non-smokers, non-sippers
Get the fuck up out of here, bitch
Nigga, it's some sipping-ass, pouring up-ass, smoking-ass
Getting high-ass niggas in here, Three 6, UGK, nigga
We putting it down in this motherfucker
And we ain't playing witcha, y'all know the motherfucking sco', homie
Now pour it up, nigga

Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

I'm trill, working the wheel, a pimp, not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinching and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the red promethazine, thick orange, and yellow tuss
Hydrocodone on the hands-free phone
The '84 Brougham on them blades, twenty-inch chrome
If you got sixteen, you can get a bizzerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizzurp

Some niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas, they want it, want it
Some niggas, they joning, joning, but I be fucked up, up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't 'bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high, we gon' get high and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus, that syrup have a nigga dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freaking, she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces, all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit
Forty dollars for just one ounce, Tussionex is how it's pronounced
Niggas sipping and dipping and tripping, man, I'm 'bout all out

Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

People always asking me, ""Is the Three 6 high on that?""
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering, pup-pup powder packs
Wh-wh-where the weed at? Ain't like that we need that
NyQuil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella, that'll have you itching, man
Talking like, ""What's up, fool?"" Vocal cords sounding lame
In my days, all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes all bucked, this here shit'll knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my weekly high, gotta have that drank
Yeah, my nig, y'ain't know? I feel like I'm gon' fucking faint

Nigga, tell me what you know 'bout Frank, Nito, and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune that's sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 niggas pouring up in my southern credo
Quick, fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Bido
Cause you fronting rap sangers, be creamy like a Zanger
You ain't from the manger, boy, but you gets the middle finger
Humdanger, rum dranker, occasionally take
Your bitch to the telly and be a dick and cum slanger
When Big Bun come danger, nigga, ring your alarm
Sexy thang on my arm, cup of drank in my palm
And that crazy shit, I'm tripping on some skinny bitches
Something that's wholesome, Florida to Folsom
For the most, I'm steady sipping on some, sipping on some

Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip
Sipping on some sizzurp, sip, sipping on some, sip

New Three 6 Mafia, featuring Eightball and MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing

I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y

Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives and  keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns, a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple & swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

Puff, puff pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

What's up Mary, how you doing
Mary Jane, stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the 'gar

I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

Premro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lot of weed, but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J
8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

Her on all fours, bout to break

On through the wall, now she howlin' like a dog
Sweat poured

Me too, I ain't got nothin to do wit it
I been through wit it, you 'n it
Since the first time ya asked
And might I add
Playas like me can't be savin you rags

I ain't with that non-sense
Or that lovey-dovey mess
Feelin' kinda horny
And when I'm callin' all I want is sex
Slip on Victoria Secrets
Hit the liquor store before it close
Call Chris so I can get somethin' white to throw up in my nose
Now I'm feelin fine
Nothin but sex is on my mind

Can't stand the heat? Get outta the kitchen

Just a young playa tryin'a put my bid in
Freaks want a trick that be constantly payin
Not a ghetto thug that be constantly layin
Rainbow Inn, or the Summer Motel
Oh well, that's where the Juice mayn stayin
Gotta have a lady that wanna do what I do
Like skippin work, or love cuttin high school
Several other playas in the Three 6 Mafia
Camcorder hoes skinny dippin in the swimmin pool
Never try to argue, bother you, or fight
Keep a pack of jimmy-hats strapped on real tight
Fifth of Alize, or a tall can of Bud Light
Just for ya freaks, on the moon-light, late night

Tell me, Three 6
Who's that bumpin that music?
Hypnotizing Koop I tell you who
I'm bout to lose it
Could it be that laid back-groove type
Jazz inside thy body
Always kinda lonely
Someone want me, hold me
I said, come near, come near
Come here the Koopsta cryin' tears
I can't think positive
Though no-one cares of how I feel
Realize my mind so tight that I ain't even try 'ta fight
I cannot lie, though I can ride high, late night

It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp,Hustle & Flow: Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture,UnKnown,"You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

In my eyes I done seen some crazy things in the streets
Gotta couple hoes working on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like taking from a girl don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals

It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm trying to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm trying to have things but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm praying and I'm hoping to God I don't slip, yeah

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit

Man it seems like I'm ducking dodging bullets everyday
Niggas hating on me cause I got, girls on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder
North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th Street bound
Where people all the time end up lost and never found

Man these hoes think we prove things, leave a big head
They come hoping every night, they don't end up being dead
Wait 
I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you
That's the way the game goes, gotta keep it strictly pimping
Gotta keep my hustle tight, making change off these women, yeah

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent

Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar

Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Ever since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they playin', man they some fakery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site
And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin' to get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model, for real

Well you know me by the Juice man hangin out with Big Triece
Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up

Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

She's just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could
I got some hoes out there bringin ya boy back some good
That ghetty green you know what I mean that bitch is understood
Ain't havin to shout at no motherfuckin slut
You know I'm actin bitch make cut a fuckin rug
You better get out there and get my money in the woods
I'mma hit cha in ya head and leave ya ass with a plug
You know I gotta have, gotta get my money what

My nigga Koop blasted them niggas we missed from on the roof
Paul running with the Tech and a vest, he blast them bitches and grabbed the loot

Demonic mind, why must I love to take so many lives?
Why do I leave them suffering laying there to die?
Why do I send their mother pictures? Just﻿ to watch them cry
Why does the devil use me to commit these evil crimes?
Why must I inflict all these multiple stab wounds?
I'm grabbing the butcher knife
How come I must torture and paralyze victims
Before I'm truely satisfied
I cannot stop tryin' to prove to myself
That I am a weaponary master
So I seem to keep stocking with silencers
Bodies are scattered all over the pasture

Tools like the Glock 19 Blasting on the scene

Triple Six is blastin' bitches, robbin' riches, that's the scoop
Playa hataz mothafucker hate the shit by Gangsta Boo
Nigga just remember all the killas just ain't in yo' hood
Triple Six is all around yo' ass now, hoe, I wish you would
Test this fuckin' playa playa hataz better listen close
Now go run for help my .32 will bring you to the flo' (Flo')

Jumpin' out of the house
Fresh black Jordans on my feet
I'm trippin' out off of some rumors
Some bustas said I got killed last week
But the devils don't die, just get high
Fool you don't even not hear me though
And if it's true
Then that's the resurrection of the Three 6 Mafia h-izz-oe
Let me break it down for the rumor stars:
Who forced this untrue lisp to go 'round
Sendin' clowns with gun down Jakers live not in the M-Town, check
But there's some playa hata goin' home so I got a kinda life stay striz Bout
Another fresh paint job and the Chevy thang
Artey Bose but I'm still goin' to miss out

This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (
Talkin' that shit
)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you–I hold your head down and I fuck you like a convict, bitch (
Talkin' that shit

This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit

I don't love hoes mane, I'm aiming at your skull
Smoked out, loced out riding with the pistol grip
I don't love hoes mane, I'm aiming at your skull

And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off
Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off

Late last night lying in the bed eyes red
Thinking should I get these hoes
Thinking should I cut their heads
Should a nigga plan a hit or grab my pistol grip
And take care my business cause they don't who they're fucking with
Call my nigga Project Pat cause I know he got my back
Fuck writing rhymes, this is real shit, not a track
Camouflage in the dark for them boys who act hard
The devil on my left side, the other side I'm seeing god
Why do niggas talk shit?
Niggas can't stick together
Seeing a nigga get killed will make a nigga feel better
So I just walk in a pace thinking of the case of motherfuckers
Who trait pistol to your fucking face
This ain't no game nigga, my finger's on the trigger
The time is running out, my conscience says I gotta get him
Is there a way that a nigga can escape from hell
I fuck him up with the Mossberg buck shells bitch

Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off

Walk up to your house, knock on your door

Mossberg is all he heard after the doorbell rang
Buckshots to the brain, Triple 6 style mane
This antibiotic’s for any nigga sick about my six double-six
An automatic wizzig splizzit

The riverside G.A.N.G.S.T.A
Niggas down with the Triple Six Mafia
Let's ride, smoked out, loced out with a fat .45 on the seat
'Bout to make a sucka nigga eat the barrel when I stick it in his mouth
Give me cheese, say your ABC's
Kind of hard to do when my pistol's in your grill
Mouth full of gold teeth, smile for the kill
I'm telling you sucka ass niggas for the last time
Don't run your mouth

We finna do that dat sheeeeeit...

Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia

Bustaz get so dazed and amazed as Lil Fly enchants
Memories of ""Smoked out, Loced out"" bumped out as them demons dance
Playaz lookin' wild, stole our style, 
devil's in me so
Fly can get so violent, bustas silent when I'm on that blow
Enhance my skills to make me treal, treal enough to kill at will
Will I kill you? Fly will peel you off da map, that's also real
Don't you mothasuckas often wonder what to call this shit?
Uhmm, call it Mystic Stylez cause Fly's style so mystic bitch

The pimpin' Mack is kickin' it with the click that's known as Triple 6
Don't bar no lemon busta niggas we dont love 'em
In a trunk is where I stuff 'em
Suckas run they liquor I deliver nigga hollow thangs
Ain't got no feelings when im killin' clockers best to duck for cover
I come with a chrome yawk and makin' hoes pay the cost
Infared to ya head full of lead yawkin' lames
You can betcha bottom dollar that I'm spittin' game
Niggas underestimate my pimpin' but Mack ain't trippin'
Sprayin', layin' skanky bitches to the canvas and bustas can I man

Mystic Styles of the ancient mutilations
Torture chambers filled with corpses in my basement
Feel the wrath of the fuckin' devilition
Three 6 Mafia: creation of Satan

My styles are slick, yo body bitch that I will chop in pieces
No fuckin' clue to da 5-0 click
, no fuckin' witnesses an...
They only saw da mask of Jason that I had on my face
The scandalous bitch is so-so slick that why I got away safe
I blaze a blunt up in da air just to relax and get high
Da moon is full and all I see is 6-6-6 in da sky
The Three 6 Mafia, Da Devil's Daughter bitch is so wild
Whateva you bitches are doin' you cannot compare to our mystic style

I'm creepin' up on these hoes with the muthafuckin' shotgun
My nigga wit tha 9's showin' these bitches they can't get none
Woopin' and dumpin' and stompin' and doggin' these bitches wit animosity
Pimpin' and breakin' and cakin' these niggas
 cause these hoes can't fuck wit me
La Chat got tha gat, creepin' up from tha back
Chrome tone now it's on, never love a nigga john
Cause I'm a crazy bitch, cuttin' off niggas dicks
Man ho takin' these niggas gotta keep it rich
Bitches be runnin' they mouth about this female they don't know about
Suckas be talkin' that shit, I'm puttin' these funky niggas on da house

Mystic Styles in my head as I smoke on a blunt
Yo Crunchy Black da demons child has a mean ass stun
I had to buck you off, runnin' yo mouth with that weak ass shit
You need to keep it closed trick 
before you get yo wig split
The candle light, the demon night is what it have to be
Another problem for tha folks on Unsolved Mysteries
Ya thought I was dead naw instead I just faked on yo ass
And now I'm back wit that mask and I'm ready to blast

Now tell me something has 
emerged
Legions of demons
Koopsta Knicca finna
Rip 'em in plenty trick
For a date with my smith & wesson
Bitch you living
Now you cowards waitin' to bite our fuckin' style
Rip his legs
Cut him down
Bitch with mass up in his town
Niggas bout to break ya somethin' off up in that house of torture
Steppin' up to that Koopsta bitch
Da wicked witch of horror
Horror, da chambers, the daemons that came up
To feed on your soul fool be livin' ya anger
Now ya life's in danger

Evil...
Notice the murderous vocalist Infamous rippin' up all of your hoe shit
Approachin Da Scarecrow'll butchure and tearin' up niggas with double the lyrical dopeness
They go the lyrical legacy, let the Lord Infamous light up da melody
Every nigga that try to compare with the Triple 6 Mafia walkin' to therapy
When you walk throught the wilderness be very quiet, Lord Infamous might be out stalkin'
I suggest you watch out for the booby traps mane cause the Scarecrow is out there only for huntin'
Special thanks to my brother Bill Dunigan, Rest in Peace, he taught me 'bout these mean streets
And so therefore nigga you don't wanna come deal with the 
mafia
, we'll drop you deep down beneath
The killa imperial black miracle from the bloody pacific
Scarecrow will flow to the end of infinity with the style that's mystic

Deep when we creep, take yo' last breath
Roll up yo' tombstone, smoke a blunt of death
Beware - the Juice'll leave you funky hoes in terror
And scared of the Mystic Styles of them Three 6 devils
Whoever step up to this click then ya doomed
Cruel with my harpoon straight through yo heart fool
Soon I'll have you in a trance, swearin' hearin' evil chants
Two knives stuck down in my pants, bustas do not stand a chance

See Im'ma cold hearted killa like murderer Al Kapone
Strong as thousand mile winds and quick to break ya bones
A Glock 19, 95 I cause ya early death
Ya walkin' Triple 6 streets so foo watch ya step
We all about makin' that cheese we gotta stay straight mane
Robbin' and workin' these hoes, fool it ain't no thang
I even got virgins servin' for me in some otha nations
Pimpin' so hard that I got locked up for some tax evasion
Killers and thieves is all I ever had the pleasure to meet
A rusty ass Tec 9 will make ya hit ya knee
I'm tryin to keep from blastin' off my muthafuckin' balls
By da one in da chamber of da Glock I got in my draws
I got my cap to the side, watchin' my fuckin' back
My dogs across the street in the grass when I'm sweatin the track
Satan worshipper or thug would be my profile, read my file
I been a mean child for a while within a Mystic Style

Wait a second freak
I know you from the streets
My nigga Hurry T
Has said you chew his meat
They call you little red
The one who slobs on head
And drinks a niggas nut
Until you well and fed
To see what she's about
I creeped to her house
To catch her in her blouse
And see how big her mouth
She pulled me to her room
To get the fuckin soon
I didn't have a rubber
I fucked with two balloons
Lay on the bed
That's all she said
Her pussy has one problem
Twisted tight in streads
The fucken sounds were tunes
I fucked her with a broom
She rode it like a horse
The blood came rushing soon
When I seen that
I didn't want the cat
So I found out
And never came back

Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks on dick

Sucks sucks on dick

Had said he finally got it
The chewin' balls blow
He said he had to have it

In big ham
Licks up nuts
Like lickin stamps
She'll grant your wishes
Blow you freaky kisses
House full of G's
Freak horse bitches
Had the little freak
In my niggas jeep
Try to spit some game
To get her suck some meat
Lay on the cover
My natural hair she loved it
Stop bitch stop bitch
Please don't touch it
Took her through some hoods
And let her ho around
7 street 9 street
And street of walks and brown
Now she's in click
A pro on suckin dick
Until the rugged out
The bitch was smokin bricks
Straight trough the blow pipes
That's all she thought
Runnin from the rehab
Never got caught

Jocky-ass hoes be sticking close up on a niggas balls
Sucking on the niggidy nuts just like a mothafuckin' halls, y'all
Mentho-lyptus, bitches can't get with this
Immaculate pro pimping get the fuck up out them draws trick
Because the Lord Infamous wanna keep all
Of these bitches who working that corner
These chicks that be wishing to fuck with this pimp
And they tripping eventually run up a gonna
My game is stronger, keeping sluts on corners
When I see a fine-ass thick joint I get up on her
I know these bitches going diss these bitches blowing
A nigga always scoring 'em, never paying 'em, never owing
Scarecrow won't give a materialistic ho a penny
Fuck that bitch she get this mixed up nigga

Because these tramps will give up the guts
My nigga no matter what
Shut the talk up slut, don't want to fuck, just lick a niggas nuts


Tell me something bitch, why do hoes like you be fronting with the drawls
Knowing that you want a nigga to go up in them pussy walls
Playing that funny roll, knowing ya lacking on intelligence?
Go and do a nigga up bitch I won't tell your friends

When I let ya ass up little slut, then your ass could think why do it?

Too late now trick already got the dick
You on trial ho welcome to the pimps court
Niggas like me fuck hoes like you for sport
Adore a tramp, hey bitch, no way
Sluts like you come along every day
You want to be down with the Scarecrow better learn the rules
Starts off bitches to me mane they damn fools
You gotta do it whenever and no matter what
Shut ya legs lil slut, don't want ya guts, just lick a niggas nuts",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-lick-my-nuts-lyrics

Da Summa,Mystic Stylez,1995.0,"Uh huh, the Three 6 Mafia loungin' in the studio
Finna give y'all a little demonstration
Of how we kick it here in the M-town
Finna drop it somethin' like this

See in Memphis, them players be kind of like laid back
In some clean ass rides, blunts in the sack, I'm blowin' a pack
Hittin' the park about three, sometimes a little later
The last day of the week and they couldn't get any greater
They leaving the park and hittin' the South Park strip, ride
The South Gatin' skatin' ring later on that night
We in the lot bumpin' our underground rap tapes
Paul and Juicy part 2 and for another one, they just couldn't wait
We back at the crib sweatin' in a lil' room
W-30's, SP-12's and MPCs we use
Straight from the 4 track, to a simple cassette
That's through a pimpsta's mode
Now it's time to hit the stereos stores, collect
We at the club Friday's and Saturday's special request made
Me and Juice Man hit the tables, Koop and Scarecrow rock the stage
Bangin' so bunk, they're some fools always gotta start a fight
They usually made us close up early that night
In the summer, in the summer

With my crew we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
 (x4)

Drunk off red dog
 as we ball through the mystic  fog
Me, Scarecrow, Crunchy, Skinny, Gin and my roadie Paul
Fly got his mind up in the sky as we chiefin' high
Black Glocks, that's in the ride fiendin' for a homicide
Some Tanqueray, grab my yay, with some little Gin
That's how we always did it since I was a troubled kid
But we don't stop
Cause our heart is pumpin' blood like thunder
No man up in the trauma, head is broken in the summer

Seasons of summer the Scarecrow want the ceremonies
Till the sun sets me ease
Until the night fall breeze
Rise up to the darkness, listen close to noises in the streets
Grab my O-Z of Indonesia, 6 philly blunt leafs
Throw on me black khaki slacks and me black t-shirt
And my automatic gat in case I have to dig a plot of dirt
Then hit Paul up on his home, tell him to bring his slow ass on
So we can hit the honey comb before the ganja's gone
The summer

With my crew we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer
 (x4)

Pass the E & J, Koop
Then let's take a ride and shoot
To the high school, North Side where the players rule
I'm scopin' all the freaks, with some weave and a sexy switch
""Can I get your number?""
""I got a man""
Well I'ma holla, trick
Ballin' down valentine, one time on my mind
If they pull me over, I be hopin' they won't find the nine
Made enough from evergreen to holla at Blac and Cam
Chiefin' on the blunts in the alley slangin' boulder, 
yeah
Couldn't forget my roadie big Kurt, Swally and Dion
Project Pat and the yam shootin' teflon
Just a few homies who I grew up in the hood with me
And the ones in Orange Blossom Hubert University, yeah
It's gettin' late and now I'm ballin' down Eldridge street
Blow my horn tryin' to get this girl' attention in front of me
Cause everyday I'm out there tryin' to get a freak number
Thats how the Juice is, in the summer

With my crew we just ride
Ridin' through the hood with my homies gettin' smoked out
In the summer

That's how we do it

Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, 
plastic Glock
, 
or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it

What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, 
Cartier's and a Dracula grill

I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom

Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame

Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'

Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga

In that jail I can't be stayin' and my g's you can't be cakin'

Why you wanna try and impress me?
Always lyin' tryna' caress me

That cannot even control creation
How can He lead you to salvation
There is no hope in chaos-only
Welcome to the other side of reality
And this is your eternity

The end of the world - I can see it comin'
So I pack my nine millimeters and I start huntin'
For these niggas that talk shit
Man these hoes will never quit
Until you leave 'em hangin' from a tree or thrown in a ditch
Which one of you niggas think you really got them guts
To walk up to his house, knock on his door
Let 'em feel the buck shots of a twelve gauge
Backed up by an A-K
'Fore you go to bed at night you bitches better kneel and pray
Cause when it's business we takin' care our business
I'm clappin' on any of a witness or any who wanna get in it
Man this shit is real, not them stories you put in your raps
Not even that bullshit you talk behind a nigga back
Let me make it simple and plain: run up and you'll get your brains
Blown to the side of the curb with that plastic thang-thang
Nina Glock nineteen with the twenty clip
You don't wanna fuck with this
You don't wanna fuck with this

Therefore all you cliques

Bitch the Koopsta massive when I'm buckin' with the muthafuckin' plastic nine
Corpses that we tortured in the shed, their voices won't let me rest
Could this be the end yet or a message sent from Satan?
Nigga omens
They open the gates of horror for them horror Lords
We tortured the cases who arrested the faces of Triple 6 Devil Shyt sorcerers
Kill that bitch, chop that bitch or you might get caught on a crucifix
I'm sick of that burnin' inside of my cradle I'm wishin' that he could just come
Yet, this nina gots no trigger so I'm clickin' real quick like a serial killa mon'
Straight from that cell for real'a, I'll buck you dead my nigga
And it's a shame when I dropped'em off the blacklane
In return I got no thangs I went in dark room fool
Koop be jackin' for their thang
Every time I sees you slippin' I go and grab my Mac-10
Victims of my devil's playground, come burn with me until the end

Therefore all you cliques
And you clans
And you crews
Fuckin', fuckin' with this clique
And we gon' bring it to your ass

Totin' the dead body over my shoulder into the graveyard with my shovel and pitchfork and (?)
And I start to dig up and toss in the body and give up more money as bank of the sore
Three separate bodies hacked up with a axe and I think a big sack had been chewed up by rats
I'm just writing these poems
They bring to renown cuz I drove a steak knife to their skulls
Split wrists with needles in my fists
And amidst', thy cliques of tricks
No I'm not a Christian
But I'm mentally ill and I don't understand all the reasons why I think it's killin' season
And neither does my schizophrenic friends
So therefore, nigga, due to my mental difficulty
Scarecrow is only entertained by helping enemies bleed
Let all the bodies soak in all the blood
Let's go smoke with that chick with no pity
I bloody cut chop up they shell goes in 20 gauge fire, they dying like I was Frank Nitti
I'm having no thoughts of the lives I've done lost
When I'm blazin' that stupid gauge fire
Cause I'm havin' a Halloween slaughter in town motherfucker just like Michael Myers
There were mutilations, paralyzations, got no patience
When I'm chasin' down a patient tryin' to thwart assassination

Therefore all you cliques
And you clans
And you crews
Fuckin', fuckin' with this clique
And we gon' bring it to your ass

I'm on a cross, Lucifer please cut me free (cut me free)
I'll join your cult then if you pull these nails out of my feet (nails out of my feet)
My cross turns upside down and finally I'm loose
I flip the land and released some other sinners; Scarecrow and the Juice
I look to the sky and all I could say was ""Well finally it's on again""
No Lord could stop us now cause the demons reborn again
My praise, the first power found me so I could never cower
Without a mind fool murder bust and bounce
I'll tell you half about this antichrist
Look into my eyes tell me what you see
The demonic man about scarecrowism
Saints can you feel me
I try for years and years
Sinkin' this one day of depression
Stormy weather and church bells
Ringin' to the election of a new follower
Follow me into the trees
Watch me rob Adam
And watch me rape Eve
In this eve, much destruction

And Hell take 'em under

Anyone Out There,Chapter 2: World Domination,1997.0,"One cold winter of many tales
Trails of blood left in frozen snow
A family slaughtered by a loved one, forgive scarecrow
I turned against God and everything that I cared for most
Police arrived, candle light, butcher knives, bloody bedposts
Found staked on the floor soaked in evidence of the root of violence
Only a teen, sent to spend my final life in an insane asylum
So a few years have passed—I'm an adult, I feel better now
But no matter, I tell them that I know they'll never let me out
I rot in this dread, my only world's the one in my head
I hate psychotherapists, I walk amongst walking dead
Everyday, yes, every single day, peepin' ways to escape
I gotta find a way out this place, it's a must, got to find a way
I'm pullin' hair up out my freakin' head, yo
They tranquilize a nigga put his ass in a choke
I wanna go psycho and kill these muthafuckin' folks
But in a padded room I know I'll never get up out this hole
I'm pacin' back and forth across this room, I gotta think of somethin', man I got to make a move
The day I killed my fuckin' family, in a week or two, I got to get up back out there, I wanna do it again fool
Gettin' cool with the old ass maintenance man
I told him ""If you help me out I'd put a lotta papes in your hand
I stashed a lotta dough in dirt before a nigga left it
If you help me out when I get out I'll give you half on that deal""
The old man with it, he grinnin', dat's straight
Look here, gramps, meet me at my door for the plan round 'bout eight
Check it, pops, you got to get a shovel and a pine box
Put me in the ground and dig me out once they talk to the cops
I'm gonna need a slight overdose of some motherfuckin' sleepin' pills
So while I'm waitin' in the dirt I won't breathe up the air in here
Sneak in the office, get the keys off of Dr. Malique
And while you doin' that I'll take the pills so I fall asleep
I started feelin' my awareness fadin' away
I could slightly hear all the dirt gettin' tossed onto the pine crate
I awoke and in my square waiting to be freed
But from the light I seen
Someone killed the maintenance man and threw him in with me

I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?
I'm scared, is anyone out there?
Damn, I'm scared is anyone out there?",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-anyone-out-there-lyrics

Break out the mask and the Glock and get rid of you

Hangin' out the window holdin' tight to my murder weapon
Hit the lights, creep up slow, bullet lead catch ya lil ass slippin'
Glock poppin' bustas droppin' niggas duckin' from this shit
Mask on my face no description of who made this hit
Bitches thinkin' ""who was it?"", bitch it was triple six
Devil thoughts, evil thoughts, trizzick bitches I just clizzick
Plenty of blood, no suspects, only victims laying dead
Shells laying in their body's, it's the fucking bullet lead
Now niggas in the morgue and I could give a fuck less
Keep my business quiet as kept, mothers in that black dress
Headed back to my fuckin' hood, project born, ridge grove
Hustla' raised gangsta' raised business up in dirty coast
Now sorry you're the one got me reachin' for my hip
No friends in the game in the spot victim of my clip
Fuck all you bustas' step and you're gonna die
Comin' at yo' ass victim of a fuckin' drive by

Straight from the North bitch, ridge grove is my stomping ground
You niggas don't make a move, you bitches don't make a sound
Sawed-off gangsta' and nigga Glock back in for the 94'
Tellin' all you punk bustas man, bring that shit to the door
I'm able, unfadable no nigga' can fuck with this
You talk all that bullshit to yo' mouth goes my fuckin' fist
I'm jackin' 5000 bitch so go home and get yo' gat
You better take cover ho cause this shit is on like that
Squeezin' my fuckin' trigger blastin' to take yo' life
Your niggas done got all down so you have to pay the price
Jumped in the fuckin' ride loced up like from head to toe
I pulled out a sack of ink rolled up as we start to blow
My gat is tight in my hand it's too late to break and run
My bullets ejected bitch got shot down by teflons
On a spree, killin' see, welcome to the evil side
It's too late to run bitch, victim of a drive by

Suck a nigga dick
Suck a nigga dick, take a lick bitch

Some silly slut bitches be itchin to this, cuz my nigga snitched
All of the fellas be numb when they lick-ity lickin up under the dick-ity dick
And you mad ho, cuz we told, let your tounge up booty hole
Suckin on the niggity-nuts, gettin that pimp stick their butt
Them Kim and them Kiki freaks, love to taste the dick meat
Nasty trashy hoes that got that nut piss on their cheeks
Don't forget one named Kim the other Kiki
Triflin ass sluts that love to taste the pee pee
I heard that the hoes had start smokin coke
Garglin on the sperm like some motherfuckin 
Scope
Flirty, dirty, hoes that slurp thee, dick
Kim and Kiki pullin in the nut, they don't spit
Goddamn them some filthy ass tricks
The hoes too ugly for a fuckin description
But they always keep a goddamn penicilin prescription
Them hoes greedy with the dick, they don't take turns
The hoes got third degree knee carpet burns
You wanna know, Lord Infamous said so ho


The buck-est on the motherfuckin scene about to cum real mean on some dick suckers
You fucked with the wrong team, of niggas
And now I gotta tell what you do, what you do
Kim do you remember when you fuck two of my niggas, my niggas
Were lookin for a booty eatin ho you little nasty ass tricks
Take it slow (Don't-don't rush it)
These bitches I hope you ride but these nuts you gotta bust it


DJ Paul, sat on the wall
Once again bout to get his dick suck by the bitch named...
So once again it's on tonight
We hooked up with two dick suckers known to chew a nigga right
And ain't no stoppin it when you go to get the chewin free
Pistol on it where it should be,but you gotta know that Kiki
She don't give a fuck about the lil money spot
All she wanna do is take the dick in mouth bout nine o'clock
She ain't shit, but I just love the bitch
The only thing on her mind is layin her tongue on the dick
And that trick Kim is so motherfuckin shot
She will suck my dick coughin up blood, nut and snot
I seen the ho sip piss out the toilet
Spit it in a pot, turn the high on and boil it
Some bitches be suckin that dick and be thinkin the niggas are gonna chew them too
But not these lil hoes, these hoes don't want the chewin, they just wanna chew you
Stab it in her mouth, stab it in her mouth
Rub your fingers through her car, now these hoes won't stop until you drop
That's how I did 'em, I promised I wouldn't snitch this
Crystal's-working-in-Whitehaven and Haven View bit-ches
Now, let me give you something to think about
When I ride bitches I'm plannin to take you out

Spooky midnight has fallen and now the moon is like lit up like much of the herb
The Indo is creating illusions, my thoughts are confusing, my vision is blurred
The aroma of the marijuana, the blackest of smoke changing into black clouds
Deep down in the dungeons my darkness of demonic secrets finally aroused
Your soul is horrified, flames falling from the sky
The Three 6 anti-christ, bloody seven seas
The blackness in my eyes, I hear an angel cry
Now I lay down to die, come and burn with me
In Scarecrow’s past life I killed kings and I ruled by the spilling of blood, flesh and guts
Now I'm back and I'm more murderous and I'm known as that mad nigga Lord Infamous
The Scarecrow could never come deep wit' that flow if I wasn’t so full of that dope – you know
Triple 6 blowin' that weed and we keepin' the seed and the stem
Roll a bag in a slim
When the lights are real dim then we grab the weed pipe and the bong and we take all that smoke to our lungs
A nigga got love for the bud and I'm smokin' it up until I'm feelin' numb
When I'm getting rushed by the shotgun and smokin' like it until da break of dawn

Ain't no reason why, why
Ain't no fuckin' alibi

Why do I roll so many blunts
Do I pull them Three 6 stunts
Juicy catch me before I jump
Jump off of the ocean side
Ocean side call it suicide
Suicide is no fuckin' crimes in the devil's eye
It's black
Black in this motherfuckin' bitch

Staying on top shit
Don't playa hate congratulate me
Give me my props bitch, ugh
No top notch niggas I'm scopin' so you can't stop

The whole damn click strapped with somethin' cop
Don't think I would have sympathy for shit that I said or did
I'm daddy's little girl that got caught up in the wrong shit
So listen to my words of wisdom this shit is so so real
The realer the bitch come the stronger the nut will

When you hear the word Triple 6
You get sick
Cause you know it's many in our click
Strap that dick
When the hollow points touch your skin
Then it rips
Travel through your body then your friend
Yo wig split
Man you busters know the mob don't play
When we spray
So it's best that you stay outta our way
Or decay
Layin' your coffin in your grave
Is where you lay
Instead of walkin' round' here like you brave
Now let us pray

Loced out, smoked out where them killas hangin hoe
Deep down south in the ghetto where we slangin' dope
Lyrics do you fear it when you hear it
Enter in your head
Hypnotizing young motherfuckers
Leavin' others dead
Scared from the sight
But the truth Project Pat's gonna preach
Strugglin' every night
It's my niggas that I'm tryin' to reach
Locked in the pen

Nose all runny, find a snow bunny
Take her to the crib, make her drink cummy
I'm from the hood I ain't never did this
But now I can say I done done it
Cocaine Blain, that's my dog
Called him up to house this slut
We gone fuck her in the back of the bus
And fill her nose up full of that dust
Three 6 Mafia, wild on tour
Whooping these niggas and fucking these whores
In the bathroom bout two whole hours
Gettin' real high, passed out on the floor
Fuck that shit, niggas out of the frame
Take 'em one and one, back in the game
Back on the street, back on the strip
Looking for a freak to run a train

What you boys doing with that weed?
Where you boys going with that shit?
Begging like a little kid
Give the homie a little bit
I ain't smoke, yeah I smoke
Cheefin on that indo dope
Hypnotize better, we make cheddar
All the haters hit the road (kill yo self!)

Half on a sack of some blow
Half on a, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a, half-half on a sack of some blow
Half on a, half-half on a sack of some
Bring that dro and play the beat

My nostrils so stopped up
I can't even smell the weed smoke
The green man, he got locked up
So I better make the best out this dro
I sniff, I choke, I really enjoy myself
It might seem like I'm sick
But that done kicked in it got me there
I got a couple of chocolate thangs
I got me a couple of white thangs
I got me a couple of Chinese bitches that pussy's really sideways
I got a bag, zip lock
Filled to the brim with a pound in it
Me and Scarecrow gone fuck these hoes
And make sure the click hit it

DJ Paul, that's my dog
We break down walls like king kong
Any nigga by my pad later on
We smoke so much call us Cheech and Chong
High as a bird, no like a plane
Got me high, I'm feeling it man
Ain't no shame in my game
Give yo boy the co-cocaine",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-half-on-a-sack-lyrics

I wanna crack yo mind
Want to get you hypnotized cause you this scarecrow
Keep a mystic type of visionary rhyme

Shoot a pistol in the air make it so security can't handle
The crowd, the gotta ru rush before a few gonna get crushed
Crush crush, we got it buck buck (The Three 6)
And when the show's over I wanna see nothing but bodies
On the floor everybody know Three 6 rocks the parties

I heard through the streets that a nigga had said, something about that nigga
I think his name was Crunchy Black
But I walk up to his house, I knocked upon his door
When he came to the door, I hit him in the mouth
And I knocked him on the floor
Then I hit him and hit him somemore
Then I told that fucking boy
Shouldn't of ran his mouth about of the 
motherfucking prophet boys
Cause the 
prophet boys be hypnotizing all of y'all
Gonna tear a rope around yo throat and drag you like you want

Please stay sleep, you niggas stay sleep

Sippin' on six murdered ministers' sauce, salty blood from the cup that they call Holy Grail
Silenced for singin' so many sick songs of a place they call heaven, now skitzo broke hell
Restin' upon my black throne and I'm spyin' on suspicious suspects while sittin' on souls
Sinister schemes I decided distract on a ancient crucial past voodoo and scrolls
Satanic insignia wrote on the scene it's so sacred created by Lucifer slaves
Silent, secluded in secret somewhere in the swamp in the land of old testament days
Infinite SIX, eternal the SIX, forever the SIX, I sits outta the flames
Sick minded soldiers are suffering, seekin' and searching to slay with severe forms of pain
Scarecrow was me, I was sent from the (?) scorn with the thorn on my venomous tips
Such innocent antisocial, my there is no sun daily as the rain wipes from my lips
Indulge yourself with the poisons and noises, money and drugs, material goals
I tell you how is the profit of man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul

I click so quick, my spells are slick
I'm comin' again with much more
You niggas be jealous cuz my profit sellin'
Its fucking yo bitch but Nig-ga-roes
Just listen, I shouldn' have to mention
Yo ass is in the click, you fell in the click
Cuz you run yo mouth around the wrong misses bitch
Yo peep this, my niggas be packin' artillery
Making yo ass whine
I'm packin' this bomb ass car
That's robbin yo ass blind all the time
You think I love you, never nigga I'm out to get my cheese
Like Roger Rabbit, who framed the nigga
That guy left on his knees?
Smokin' out, cuz I need to get high before I go on my mission
My profit soldiers call me all about this thing called pimpin'
So listen nigga before you think you got a convict (bitch)
You got a steaming matter lil' boy that want the lifestyle of rich

Beware of this Klan, Prophet is just too deep
Sleep baby sleep

We creepin' up on these hoes wit the Mac-10, the Mac-12
Hit 'em wit the Mac-11, catch ya slippin at the 7-11
Put the slugs in the back of his cap, send him straight to heaven
Seven little villains couldn't stop the six
Certainly when ya fuck around wit da Three Six
Mafia on top a ya
Game, really gotta wake 'em up wit the piggy bank
Really tho, sissy ho, we up in ya house
Boo under da bed, Crunchy behind da couch
Get 'em up wit galled off
Wit da mother fucking shit we talkin' about
Thug'd out, drugged out, already
Get 'em in they mother fucking sleep like Freddy
Split it, doin' it, them mutha fuckin niggas doin' it
Pourin' it, the mutha fuckin Posse bitch
While you thinking we slackin' up, we jackin' up yo fuckin shit
Enemies from day one, but today sons, don't last, so ball it
Where ya run at? Da Three Six gun that
All bitches about the cheap
Hangin low and standin' hi, stayin' hi, on the mutha fuckin street

Should I let a nigga live?
Should I let a nigga die?
I should watch a nigga cry
While I sing dem lullaby
As da tears hit the floor
Dealin' shit, how not a roar?
Crunchy Black is not a whore
And Raven Red and heavens door
As I soar through yo life
You be beggin' for some Christ
Ain't no mutha fuckin' Christ
All I wanna see is die

Yo sleep at night
We comin' thru yo mothafuckin' window pane
Make sure at night
You shut it tight so the killer won't split ya brain
Don't make a move
In ya room, you better believe it's a big surprise
Nuttin but them two
Like a Glock or a set infrared between ya eyes
Tie that bitch up
With the gray tape, rest of the body wrap it up with a belt
Chop, chop, chop
Cut the dead body up til ya know there's nothing left
Please stay sleep!

Gals break when they see em' it's hard to breathe like they got asthma
Older people trippin' cause they think they seein' thangs

Everybody let ya spinwheels spin like a spinmill
Juicy J on certain pills, cruisin' down to Knoxville

I'm tired of hidin' from 5-0 cause these fools scope me nightly
I'm changin' my identity and playin' more roles than that nigga Spike Lee
This shit ain't fake I gotta break
And get the fuck by from this murder case
For chill this shit is cool to rap about but see to me it ain't no fun when it's real
Them cops can't roll to Triple Six so no lord can save'em
I try to least stay after but now I ask for another favor
One of my homies died, two of my niggas in the J.C
But now I ask of you, first power, bring them back to me
We ran a job off top, we had to pop some cops
But still some fools house made us lead us to his stash pizzot
Skeemask over my skull, papers in my mouth cause I'm grilled
Bitch it's a house call, Glock nine with no love, killas from the south gotta peel
Caps and the make shells fall, but I will be the only one still leg Locked
Stay employed to this B, it's like a job to me to lay down you niggas, you bitches
You snitches, smoke swishers and plan my sweet robberies


This shit is on, I'm scopin' out this fool that I don't like
Who fucked me out some money

Wait till the night
I'm gonna touch him with a gauge, gotta touch him with a gauge
Niggah think he fucked me gonna get his ass sprayed
First I hit the weed bomb, fifth full of red rum
Nigga better give me some or I'll make your body numb
Bitch, I thought you knew it was on when you pulled that shit
Flodgin' ass niggah prepare for the triggah with no fuckin' heart
You gonna meet this sick killah don't step
Better watch your back, better watch your self
Watch out for the niggas you trust or take your last breath
When I put this tone up in your face it's gonna be a case without no trace
The robber had a mask on, tryin' to get his blast on
No evidence cause this shit will be erased
We're in Pauls chevy deep, with visions in your sleep

Lord Infamous and Crunchy Black got them gats to your back
Another sweet robbery, another motherfuckin' jack

Cops caught the witness on me and my niggah (?) on many of hoes
So you triziks can witness the Triple Six click for them souls like robbery pro's
Kurt rolled the windows so no slawness could get out or in
Paul caught two bitches in the den, commiting like ruff up in ten
Ten corpses dead with torches to the night into they brain
The pain didn't go away so we buried them bitches on another day
No heaven sin, no evidence man you can't fuck with this

Back Against da Wall,Mystic Stylez,1995.0,"My name is the Scarecrow
Busters they approach, they really don't know me too well
I put in the 50 round magazine watchin' them spin as I empty the shells
Bodies are smackin the mud, bustas are constantly donating blood
I pull the sawed off out my coat pump it twice and watch each tear 'em up n' run
Oh no we do not mind my part in genocide
Oh no we do not mind committing homicide
Although the way you live is how you must die
The Scarecrow will try his best to take your life cause I know you will try to take mine
I do onto others before they do onto me
And my fingers refuse to release when I'm squeezin' the trigger on nina milli
Cause suckers be trying to take all the things you been working so hard for
But I can't hit the floor, I would rather go out in the smoke
And so I'll do what I'll have to do
I don't want to kill you yet I will fool
Before Lord Infamous take a fall I'll spray all of y'all
Aww mane, they got my back against the wall

Ohh, that's how it is in the ghetto
(I got my back against the wall, wall, wall)
All the player haters and jealousy in the ghetto
Childrens crying, homies dying
(I got my back against the wall, wall, wall)
It's how it is in the ghetto
Pop pop pop, another trick sucka dropped
Pop pop pop, another trick sucka dropped
Pop pop pop, another trick sucka dropped
Pop pop pop, another trick sucka dropped

A quarter after twelve, I'm still cruising down them back streets
On my job a dead body already lies on the passenger seat
Just did one for the money now I'll do two for the show and
When I drop the third body I'm gettin' ready to hit the road
I'm spendin' bloody money in the streets, cause that's all that I got From ones I've laid in the past and the new heads I just cracked
But all had to go sour when some fools tried to rush
The tables turning before my eyes, now it's me they trying to touch
I put the pedal to the mizzetal, strap my fo fifty five my seventy two
I looked up in the rear view - they still comin', them fools must got one too
Comin' up on the side, it's on, I feel they can't be real
The dead body I was transporting fell on my lap, I'm liftin' it up, they getting my steel
They started lettin 'em off, I tried to ram 'em the telephone post on the sidewalk
I got intentions to (?), I laughed as them fools take a fall
Not even no my roster for the day but my back was against da wall

Ohh, that's how it is in the ghetto
(I got my back against the wall, wall, wall)
When a gun is to your head there's nothing left to be said in the ghetto
You better watch your back cause you might get car jacked

Pop pop pop, another trick sucka dropped
Pop pop pop, another trick sucka dropped

I'm that fool you don't know, I'm that one you can't see
That'll be scopin' with that gat infrared behind the trees
You gon drop to your knees, you gon' yell ""Brother please!""
All the police on your force gon' be scared to witness me
When you see me in the traffic psychopathic killer addict
Kidnappin' MPD's, choppin' heads off with the hatchet
Throwin 'em in a rotty ditch while the night is filled with mist
Mystic styles 'bout the killers from the six double six

In the alley's not a bum, just a gang creepin' low
Fourty four is the tool, pluggin hoes in the 'fro
Break the law on a slaw cop cause I'm down to blast
Paul and Infamous scrapped with the nine in they lap, plus the stash
Crunchy black at the hideout, smokin' quarter pounds
(Smothered by the weed bomb)
First contestants fallin' down, flag covered up over the casket
Bitch we leavin' a dead cop surrender, no cousin, no friend, no son
Sooner or later, no matter your crews gon' drop

Ohh, that's how it is in the ghetto

Mothers crying cause their babies are dying in the ghetto
One time - some are straight, some from the tek

Finally, I got all real niggas on on a muthafuckin' Posse song
Niggas that's down to cut some muthafuckin' heads
(Mafia, ya, y-ya, y-ya, ya, ya) 
From hear to ATL, to Nashville, back to the M-town nigga
And you know what that mean bitch
Makin' easy money, pimpin' hoes is serious bitch
Makin' easy money, pimpin' hoes is serious nigga

Call a nigga, drug dealer, out here on the track nigga
Weed smoker, coke snorter, come and get a pack nigga
Cane slanger, bitch banger, dog I'll bring it to ya
If you got a problem with me, holla at my Luger
Dro puffer, cheese come up, when we on the track jack
Hit you in the head, with the gat, 'til your skull crack
Blood gushin', head rushin', act first, no discussion
Come with that bullshit, then the bullets start bustin'

First crime, we came with Mystic Stylez on grime
You slip, I Live By My Rep don't fuck with mine
Da End, the souls of men embedded inside the Posse
The Prophet, the Posse, we all collide
We brutal, the Chapter 2 to end the phase, our mind
In crime, reminds, CrazyNDaLazDayz
Hypnotize, and blazed another gold plate
Sixty 6, sixty 1, The Smoke Clears, evaporate

I got a 357, a tec with a black clip
A 180 pounds witha fist that will bust lips
Some killaz on my side, if I tell 'em they gon' get
A fool violatin' the business, I ain't wit'
And now in 2000 you talkin' the same shit
And now in 2000 I'll bust and I won't miss
The smoke is in the air the liquor is still a fifth
The grill is still gold, and the curls they know kick doors

First one of us is done, hollow tips come by the ton
Two AK's, and put some drama to leave this niggas bodies numb
I don't talk this shit for fun, cock it back and let it go
And 6 shots, from the 3-6 shooters lettin' 'em know, WHOA!
Picture me, naked face, to kickin' in your door
4, niggas deep, bandanas with black calicos
So, when we creep, drop cause I'mma hit you nine times
Take your nine lives, Young Buck and Hypnotize your mind, blow

You can believe this, you can believe that
And believe I got a baseball bat
And I'm bustin' your head black
You believe I'm comin' strong
You believe I'm all grown
You believe, that nigga, I love to get it on
You half steppin' I got the weapon Boom! Boom!
I'm blastin' at your mind to get you believe that
I love to kill, I love the thrill
And I love to put a nigga body parts in the field, nigga

No no, come, come and get this bitch
Ain't got no time fo no shit
Got all my boys, don't make no noise
Just throw that trick in the ditch
It ain't no way La Chat gon' let it slide
With the shit that you done
I got my piece for what I do
To show you who the fuck number one
I shot that bitch without causes, ain't got no love in my heart
It ain't no way that I can't handle, keep that tone in my jaw
This ain't no crap, I speak the truth
Gotta come too thick to get me
On one of you hoes, before you come
La Chat ain't gone easy

Man a bitch'll take that lil bit out her pussy for them papers
Get the fuck away from me ho
Because the crew can't stand them vapors
Take her, break her, to whip that funky bitch
Talkin' that shit about this
Man you'll get 10 slugs up in your arm pits
Yeah we can do it take your time and do it right
You can gimme the fuckin' chewin', I can fuck you all night
Wanna fight about your friends
See how them bitches gon' start
See now that's that type of shit
That get my muh'fuckin' dick hard

Capital Mack-11's, and load 'em full of ammunition
Terrorist sect's, we pull and lock'em in the Expedition
No set a niggas got guns equivalent to what we pack
Nuclear pistols and fire scorchin' automatic gats
How in the fuck can you handle the, butsa damager
Toss that bitch over the banaster, like trash canisters
Hollow points into your battle troops, when I have to shoot
Plus I'll be storin' the cap for you, and trick be absolute

I woke up early Saturday morning
Suddenly your phone was ringin' off the charger
Thinkin' to myself, man, is it a bitch or cop, or is it them robbers
Got MC Mack of in a scheme, I'm stainin' for my dividends
And pay a livin', neh nigga
Gon' bother my cheese gon' reach the ceilling fan
You can catch my in that president thing, on gizold when you see me
You can joke me, ever rope me, best believe your bleed this evenin'
Fuck the reason, and the treason
Time to get dirty nigga better I'll pop it
You was gaspin' for your life, but all I heard was Killa Klan Kaze

Bitches think we playin', think this killa shit a joke
Don't fuck around with HCP and get you ass smoked, ho
Comin' with some fully auto's, fuck some semi's
Hit 'em with some hollow auto's, cause I desp-iz-ise
Blastin' like some rondo batays, for you mayatez
Koop with double clicks and duct tape, and wicked wizays
And I, perferrin' keepin' busy in my free time
Taught 'em in that buried unknown, they want a reason why
Give you second thoughts about that business, you then finished right
Take you to the vault, cash it in, all night flight
And I'm in a bad mood, cocaine make it that
Plus, I gotta ease on this nine-milly, willy, nigga I slang with that

Everyday pushin plenty keys
Nigga dont know me
Cause I ain't no phony
And I ain't the nigga you can whoop and call me Toby
Low key on his ass, waitin' for the night to come
So I can kick down his door and make him give me some
Bitch I with a little young nigga age thirteen
Fucked up in town while I watched yo ass ride clean
Now that Im grown up
From the hood I gained nuts

But now its time cut the shit where's my mind at my best
I gotta test a nigga to see what he got can a fool
Make you straight a couple of g's, I need more cheese

I gotta roll straight through the shit sometimes I wonder will it end
Cause I rob for petty shit I'm riskin' my life pullin' yo card
After y'all push him off the wood grain a pop off his smile a one eight spot
I'm dodgin' the cops watchin' my b-izz-ag fools kinda like a snitch
But when I do my boys I find there house and go up in that shit

Check it out
Nigga I'm kickin' in doos, bodies are froze
Bloody ya clothes, gun to ya nose
All of you niggas you really need to give up money and dope
Face the floor, forty-four, into ya head, droppin 'em dead
Infamous fled, put them to bed, with the weight, then escape
Count the stacks, shine my gat, after I jack like a rat on the creep
All you dopehead niggas will get put to sleep
When I sneak, give up the dope or get a hole in yo cranium
You see this mean artillery you know it is containin' some
Shit that makes me flexible to make your life ejectible
And with this bullet in your brain you be dead either comatose
So when you pushin' candy with the Scarecrow comin to smoke you mane

Bin Laden,Da Unbreakables,2003.0,"Man.... Hey nigga, check this shit out: We was up in Chicago, right? With my nigga Big Hemp, y'knowwhatI'msayin? Man, the nigga pass me a blunt, man, like ""Smoke this shit, nigga! This some of that Bin Laden Weed! Y'all don't know nothing bout this shit down south!"" I was all like: ""What? What the fuck is Bin Laden Weed?"" The man said: ""The shit's like three different kinds of weed, man, grown all together."" He said that shit some straight killer. Them Chicago niggas, man, they named that shit ""Bin Laden Weed,"" man, some straight fire!

Who got that hydro
Who got that light green
Who got that Bobby Brown
Who got Bin Laden weed

I swear sometimes I got to get high to hang around my ho
Sometimes I feel like I got to get high to hang round niggas I know
I sped it up on WEED, I slowed it down on SNOW
Cause I seen so many niggas fall off that blow
One day they got it all, the next ain't shit to show
So off that yayo my nasal I had to cut that ho
But now I'm feeling happy I'm on that Binny Bin Laden
And niggas is actin' like they don't know what the fuck just happened
My vision getting blurry, I'm 'bout to fall asleep
Or am I dying if I OD cause this some potent weed
My life start flashing like holograms like right in front
Of my own face I never felt this way off one blunt
I see my son gaining life and my dad losing his
And old girlfriends and niggas I shouldn't have hung with
The picture starting to fade, it's getting hard to breathe
I'm blacking out with no post up under my shirt and sleeve


Well since I'm on Bin Laden let me tell you a story
Bout these three pussy rappers who couldn't do nothing for me
Gave 'em whole lot of cheese and said I fucked 'em and shit
Smoked a whole lot of weed so they seem to forget
Who bought them drugs, and them cars, put you bitches in homes, who told yo ass to take a bath until you thought you was grown
Mane I tell you he a killer when we talk on the phone
When you see him face to face he'll leave you alone
That's why I'm smoking on this fucking Bin Laden
All my niggas in the hood they got it
Take one little puff you a addict
Take a gun to the head means tragic
Boy I tell you like this we can smoke it anywhere
In front of police station with a six pack of beer
Seven A.M. in the morning just watching people stare
Let 'em point them damn fingers say they wild over there


Ey ey it's glowing like its indigo, I smell it through the bag
I'm floating like a magic carpet straight from Baghdad
From my brains, from my blood, from my lungs, from the Dutches
Can't just let pure simply just escape from my a clutches
Cause it's the substance I'm loving, I'm buzzing
Smoking like an oven, huffing and puffing
This ain't Indonesia, Colombian or Cali man
It's a bio-weapon, straight from the Taliban

Do you remember me from smoking good weed
Break it down roll it up give me indonese
Do you remember me from no sticks no seeds
Or you remember me from putting you on this Laden weed
Get yo funds together and come go and see
I'm gone take you on the strip where Bin Laden be
This one blunt action you'll have to smoke and see
Have you choking, falling out with your family",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-bin-laden-lyrics

Cut with the mask and the pistol grip
I gotta touch 'em

This shit is beginning to come into focus but no one can figure out Infamous murderous, dark psychosis
Trippin I'm running the darkness, I'm loading berettas, I'm jacking yo' ho shit
A posse of satanic mobbers, we coming to smoke 'em and leave 'em in puddles of plasma
I'm coming for stashes, for cash then blast until everyone in here passed out
My fellow man, you cannot comprehend strength of the devil military killers
Execution to death, you will be sentenced as I put Nina into your head through the pillow
The Three 6 nigga coming to injure you at nightfall
Give it up or this desert eagle shall make them fall up on you all
(Come on mayn, you finna give me them ?? nigga)
Naw bitch... (aww dog ???)
Naw bitch... (a couple of hundred mayn)
(Just a couple of hundred mayn a couple hundred) Check it out my nig
I'm gonna kill you any way you won't need none of that shit
Ran through the backyard, jumped the gate to the corner of the back street
Hopped into the steamer, tossed the fuckin' stash behind the seat
I'm coming to rush 'em son, crush 'em son, buck my gun
I'm gonna reach out and touch someone

Cut with the mask and the pistol grip

I got a problem, money dividends, gotta solve them
The only thing going through my head is murder and rob them
I heard they got cash, I gotta touch they ass
Quick, fast, in a hurry, get away with a fuckin dash
Every night I sit and think on
Why these hoes keep playing with me
They gonna make me click them clicka click
And they don't wanna see my bad side
P. they gonna make me transform to another man
And make they motherfuckin ass do the devil dance
Crunchy Black bitch, coming at you hoes easy come easy go
Easily we kicking doors, I gotta touch 'em

In my fuckin head, I vision bloody red
As I chopped off his fuckin head, left him dead for them bitches
A psycho at large, dumb bitch don't step to this bomber squad
I'm hard and I go and I rip you apart like a prey (?) the predator
No need for them paramedics, see wait for the Koopsta scared 'em

I hooked up with a few down niggas from the M-town
Then we started robbin outta town, makin' them lay it down
Touchin' crackers with a 12 gauge to they fuckin' back
Stickin' them liquor stores, robbin banks, plenty car-jacks
Snatchin old ladies purse, knockin niggas to the dirt
My 9 gone make yo body hurt, I'll put your body in a hearse
Call me a playa hater, traitor, what you want bitch
Strapped wit them thangs on your ass, hear them guns click
Inside job, strictly robbin so you better beware
Of the nigga with a gat and mask, raise 'em in the air

Now life was up and down for the Killa Man as a youngster
Stickin these tricks up daily you tripping I'm still a hustler
Cutting class don't make my snooze behind the barrel
Shootin crowds I hit it up in a honeycomb
And smoke a fuckin pamper house
Hollerin at my brother Phil D I gotta get straight
No thang mayn he got me straight
That thang fool be booming weight
Hoppin on my scooter with my ski mask and my Deuce Duece
All blue joggin' suit, tube socks, and Coogi troop
But now I'm getting older, comin' clean is what I'm hopin'
And now that I got boulder dope girls are what I'm scoping bitch

Juice got weed Juice got pills
Juice got the work on the corner cuttin deals
Juice know you haters out there snitchin ain't for real
So Juice got some gang niggas down for the kill
Juice know the feds got surveillance on the field
We never had a job but we sittin on a mill
We ball out in the club wit our niggas stayin trill
We never wrote a check just them big face bills
A player drinking Maker's Mark-er, cranberry vodka
Wearin a mink coat thats furry as Chewbacca
I saw ya main girl and a playa had to stop her
Her name wasn't Silkk but her face was The Shocker
The feds takin pictures of us ballin but I got 'em
A 7 footer hole for his body we gon drop 'em
We always on the grind we be watchin when they watchin
And when they turn they back its the clucka-clucka-rock 'em yeah!

If you boys got beef we can (roll wit it)
In the club or the street we can (go wit it)
It don't make me none (blow for blow wit it}
Crack his head wit a gun (I'ma sho split it)

We got them tones in the club and them bulletproof vests
Them three fifty seven titanium Smith-N-Wess
And plus we deep as hell and prepared to bust
You gonna have hell if you fuck wit us and thats whats up
The whole club we maintain
These Hydra-Shok® bullets mushroom in your brain
We in bed with the med we give 'em somethin to do
Cuz clown ass niggas love to act a fool

My hood is real nigga my hood ain't fake
My hood is home nigga everythang straight
My hood will rob you with mask on they face
My hood will do it to put food on they plate
My hood ain't tame dog they wanna jump fool
My hood they hang together they all jump you
And if you don't believe me then come to my hood

Where da Bud At (Crazy Off da Budsack),Underground Vol. 1: 1991-1994,1999.0,"Sometimes I just wonder, why come I commit all these murders when full of the ganja?
I smoke up the sack and I load up the full metal jacket like I'm in a trauma
Drama, the drama begins to blow up, I'm corrupt off the onion
Indo blunts light buds, when I light up the fuse I light niggas in dungeons
That I place with the nina, the nina, I roll up a blizzunt as big as my finger
Watch as I choke off this spliff and rip up niggas like wars in Korea
Chief on the reefer that come from a hundred acres down in Panama
When the smoke fills my jaws, I wanna kill bitches with chainsaws
Doc, I close the doors, the windows and get lost in the fog
The smoke is so thick in my room I can't even see the fucking walls
Chase it down with a 64 ounce of beer everyday as a sequel
Then I want to go and murder some bitches with a 50 caliber Desert Eagle
Deeper, steeper, damn I'm full of reefer
Peep the creeper, I don't like you neither
Nigga know you got that shit, fool, where the shit at?
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off da budsack

Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac
Scarecrow, I get so crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud
Crazy off the bud sac
Crazy off the bud sac

As I chief up on the leaf, a Swisher sweet
I see this nigga, he is tryin' to creep
On me, Lord Infamous, call me the Scarecrow, ammo
Full clip unload, this nigga smoked
Now he gone, didn't believe the song, I shoot that tone
It goes﻿ on, and on and on, and on and on
I'm the zone, my mind it floats, off indo dope
Ain't no hope as I peep through the scope, with the bud in my throat
So it's lit, fuck up your shit with panic off the blinker
Evacuate the fucking area cause I'm so sinister with the street sweeper
Deeper, I'm deeper than devils that drill in the depths of Hades
Maybe I'm hazy, the hizzay has gotten me crazy
I'm dazing, I'm dazing, always so amazing
Spray these saggin' glazin' ganja bizzitches 'cause they possess me
Cock back the gat, then I lay down a few sheets
Pack the zig zags, no love jack, nigga where da budsack?

Long Nite,Mystic Stylez,1995.0,"I got a plan in command on your ass, bitch
This little short young niggas in them caskets
You bein' front black nigga rolled up layed up on your ass, ho
Peter-rolled by Koopsta, Crunchy, Juice, Paul, Boo and Scarecrow
Oh there's a whole lotta demons in my world today
Which means you run into a nigga like Koop, a nutcase
Here I can tell by tha day it's gonna be a long night
When I take a swipe for yo life, my big black butcher knife
Now while I'm kickin' niggas fiendin' just to kill 'em, though
Before I go and chief them Swishaz with them Navajos
Upon tha mighty Mississippi, bow can I fuckin' kick it?
You better answer quick before I hit you for them riches

Punk ass niggas wanna really try to jump up but they know they gonna catch a couple of my sub-machine gun fire to they jaws
I kick shit flyin' through tha air, you wanna dare to test me, I am the Infamous nightmare, I wanna break some laws
I practice secret forms of voodoo culture
Dead flesh sculpture for my pet vultures
Sleepin' in tha death defying beyond human measurements
Into my private temple in tha middle of Mount Everest
Smokin' pine as I sky dive off of mountains
In my mind blood squirtin' high out of fountains
Countin' corpses in my black fortress
In tha hallway painting satanic portraits

See it was me, Lil' Buck, and my nigga Lil' Knife
And some thug ass fool I never seen in my life
We roll in Bobby's 'Lac with tha gold bones and vogues
Full grain, cloth top, sturdy pullin' them hoes
The nigga that I didn't know said he had some on a weed
And stoppin' by tha crib so he can get up on some cheese
I've smelled shit in the game as soon as he opened his mouth
We dropped him off, da fool went behind tha fuckin' house
I didn't think shit about it but some minutes had to pass
Made me really not trust his busta ass
I looked around and somethin' just made my eye switch
Twenty mo niggas dressed just like a bitch
Not takin' no chances I'm knowin' it's a stick up
But when we tried to bail we got blocked by a pickup
Dropped tha fools tryin to test my pimpin' to see what I'm all about
But speakin' too soon, I got blasted when I stepped up out da Cadillac
Vision blur I'm seein' 9-9
I was up on my back seein' a 6-6 up on a street sign
Lil' Buck slammed right into them durves
Made a U and scooped me as I cross straight to tha curb
My nigga Lil' Knife let tha Tech start rippin' me
From tha last hoes who still stood on they feet
Now we gettin' tha fuck up out of the hood
That was all wrong but takin some lifes made it right
It was a long night

It was a long night when I was locked down in 201
Back against tha wall smokin a square cuz it ain't no fun
Watchin' niggas fight over phone calls, gettin' buck
Knowin' when they get they life sentence man they ass stuck
Niggas always nervous cuz they servin bustas with a swords
Pullin' tha real killaz, GD's, Crips and Vice Lords
Lower level ain't a joke, a nigga got his neck broke
Thrown to tha ground like a bitch pickin' up tha soap
But I wasn't goin' cause a nigga like me kept a shank
If a fool stepped to me his face'll be in tha paint
Waitin' for a guard talkin' smart, it'll be a fight
In 201 locked down it was a long ass night

We call up the Devil's nights
I walked down tha hallway where tha walls are lined with candle lights
Sacrificin' doom when you enter tha Triple 6 gun room
Soon I will choose tha weapon I find most appropriate
For reasons I take tha Smith & Wesson and a Mac 10
Paul walked in he grabbed a street sweeper, Grim Reaper and a Glock 19
Crunchy Black he took tha goddamn M-16
Buck called up Koopsta, told him to get tha shovel ready for burial of the bodies
Lets put them on Unsolved Mysteries
Ease please creep up in tha trees with tha night scope
Inhaling on a blunt of Cambodian red dope
Them niggas died in a blast we stuck they gas in
Motha fuckin' Triple 6 assassins",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-long-nite-lyrics

Bodies in my yard, oh my god them demons came again

Ho, eternal burning you will have if you don't comprehend
Understand this shit a gansta bitch is sayin to ya dawg
Lock you in the trunk, mob through the night within the mist of fog
Never fear a nigga callin himself a killa, what's up bitch

Chillin at the hideout, smokin' out, not worried bout a thang
Ballin through Black Haven, deep as hell in that suburban mane
Always watchin my back cause niggas will jack you for your fuckin shit

?Fly? down to put yo ass, before you meet the Devil, the metal
Penalties I pay by punk ass opponents, I practice pain
Juiceman no gain, but I slang that thang that keep ???

I'm steady scopin out these nothins, that be actin like a bitch
That be actin like a ho
That be actin like a muthafucka busta
That wants no more of the 3-6 Mafia, trizack-wizack niggas
Come and feel these triggas, ya figure ya bad
Bellin out Black Haven but I double dem bucks in yo ass, instead
Triple muthafuckin 6, in the muthafuckin plizay
For the n-zine decade
Nigga didn't hear me do, but a muthafuckin click
In somebody's y-zard he laid
Where the niggas in the club?
Where the niggas in the streets ain't down with us?
Man, say a few prayers
G-Ds, V-Ls, cr-zips, bl-zoods, all niggas throw yo setts in da air

If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
If you niggas ain't scared, throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air, throw yo setts in da air
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up
Cause we some killa ass niggas
And we don't give a fuck
We come to break the fuckin laws
And tear the fuckin club up

When the biblical stories were written they left out the one they call Lord Infamous
Because the horror he possess was one of a magnificence
He was set to be Lucifers only mortal kin
And he was set to lead the world into unholy acts of sin
The architect of hell
And inventor of the six interior decorator of chambers of eternal punishment
I'm the one that lit the furnace to the flame that burns forever
Supervisor of the torture, Lord have mercy? Not me, never
I'm clever with corruption of the Seven Seas and continents
Demonic shit, the blunt is lit, the bong is hit, astonishin
Watch the world - I crumble it, watch heaven - I rumble it
God kicked Scarecrow out of heaven for he did the Devil bitch
Holdin angels hostage in the basement of Hell Chapel
The only nigga to ever set heaven up for a fucking gaffle
The Devil fever flowin through the fire hemisphere
Evil niggas throw yo sets in da air, if you dare

Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air
Throw yo setts in da air

In-2-Deep,Chapter 1: The End,1996.0,"Yeah, you better watch the situation you gettin' involved in (Yeah)
You might get involved with the wrong people
Get into a situation you might can't get yourself out of (In too deep)
Dig a hole you can't climb out
You know what I'm saying
Get in it too deep

I'm in it too deep to get on out
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sitting up all night, I can never rest my head
How will my family take it if I ended up dead?
I'm in it too deep to get on out
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sitting up all night, I can never rest my head
How will my family take it if I ended up dead?

There was a man who approached me every night
When I was resting fast asleep
He traveled deep into my mind
And he promised me power beyond my wildest dreams
He said he could take me away from the suffering
Begging and our poverty
So I had to agree, there's one catch:
I must worship him throughout the centuries
But I really didn't know any better
I'm tired of the pain and Koop taught me running
He gave me the things he promised to me
But I cannot leave I will suffer forever
I'm tired of this wrong
But all his powers are much too strong
Oh so bad I want to move on
But if I do my soul is gone
Liars, fornicators, all you murderers, adulterers, and thieves
What you don't know
Is that you're walking in the same shoes with me

Nothin' but a novelty, that's all I see
Is he close to me
He said is she Victoria Secret
Hells of the air with the smells of a prayer
Bled right here with a stale bud
Doggystyled in a chair
Turned him on his stomach
And she's moaning from the motion
If you ready for the sticky green
Koop finna come a little bit closer
Rolled him over just before a sound went pop
Then I reached for my heart
Oh my god Koopsta just been robbed
I hope you feel me
I'm laying naked lookin' at the ceiling
In bloody red
Just same old same for the Koopstas

I'm in it too deep to get on out
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sitting up all night, I can never rest my head
How will my family take it if I ended up dead?

I'm in it too deep to escape this kind of drama
That costs us playa hatas and fakers
That equals problems
Today in this day in time
You can't read nobody's mind
These smiles turn to frowns
When they see a playa on the rise
On top of the world
Just a lookin' down and laughing at'cha
I never be bothered like 2pac
I ain't mad at'cha
So baby beware
This game of life is like do or die
It's hell on this earth
The only thing that's missin' is the fire
Come on baby tell me
Is it something that your eyes can't see
Or are you just blind to the fact that you in it too deep

Yeah I know what ya mean
I had to stand on my ground
To give them the scene
Just me and my brotha down in the struggle
Then I serve 'em to the fiends
And after dark, deep in the park, them doped up fiends
Would start to light their pipe all through the night
I use to wonder will God
Please help the poor come up on their feet
Cause there was nothing to eat
Didn't want to jack or rob
A brotha had to maintain the streets
Up in the projects wasn't no flodgin'
Cause I was trying to get out who can you trust
I had to be tough, I never ran my mouth
Me and the crew would constantly hit the brew
A natural high
How can you make it in this world but to try

1991 was the year, 901 was the area code
Three eight double one six
Was the zip code of all the roads we rode
Now let my story be told
A young boy dropping out of school house
But not to learn off in the 10th grade
Try to come up at last like a total outcast
Off all them songs I done made
Boom my undergound tapes up and down the hall
To DJ Paul wasn't no damn thing
But to my dogs Tony and Shysta
Asked me to join a gang ""that ain't me manne""
But hanging around them fools
I had to get down and join the click see
Cause I made so many enemies
From clicks up in my city
Now if I told ya what gang it was
Then to you I would seem more than down
But if I told ya what gang I'm in
I can only do a show off in my own town
But it's all to the good
Much love to the thugs an my good
And in my set much respect
I wit'cha for life that cha can bet
We lights one up tonight

I'm in it too deep to get on out
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sitting up all night, I can never rest my head
How will my family take it if I ended up dead?",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-in-2-deep-lyrics

Through thy window, somethin' creepin' up slow
It was this Lotus driven by this hoe
So I'm sippin' on thy Rémy
Hoping it won't cross my rhodes attention
Not only was you in it yet another nigga drivin'
Paul stopped the car
Said: ""want you buck 'em rough Koopsta?""
Shi'r't I know ya hurt, take them bi'r'ches back
Take 'em back with them slugs
Sad to see ya gone son, teflons in yo crest

Cut ya up like Jeffrey Dahmer biatch

Scarecrow miss ya bump, bump off a nigga fakin'
Goin' to a region, bitches tremblin', shakin'

How long ago deep in the North
Where niggas stay drunk and smoke Newports
From ??? street with all my peeps
I used to scratch and program beats
I made a mix with real deep bass
At Northside high be slangin' tapes
DJ in this shit tryin' to make it and shit
Tone they speakers and stack they crates
Studio gig was the place to be
Where all jocks were tryin' to get
The chance get on the tables and spin
A fool kept tryin' i could quit
The club was packed from wall to wall
The gangsta walk is what we called
When niggas got buck in a circle and danced
And dared a fool, to slip and fall
We tore up the club and showed no love
Just throw in our face and gettin real buck
They might wanna fight later on the night
Cause Memphis playas don't give a fuck
Security jumped we smack the punks
For throwin' us out for smokin' a blunt
The number one song, had just came on
And now it's time to fuckin' stomp

Juicy's in the motherfuckin' house, fins'to peel yo
Motherfuckin' skin back, it's they fuckin' steelo
On your fuckin' ass, we can't brag
Cause we comin' up, robbers on my ass
Should I blast cause they runnin' up
Maybe it's my friend, but then them friends will turn too yo
With the sig sauer 9, boy I come to kick doors
I stick those bitches in my trunk and now we back to my hood
The one on the left ain't die yet but he wishin' he would
Wasn't in the mood for this buck shit
But these niggas had to creep and boy they stupid
I sit, I leave these hoes for a permanent sleep
And now we out to the club we gotta get em' up
Triple 6 and Prophet Posse, ya'll know we make em' stomp

Ridin down the street man I whip my big car
I scoped a little sexy little mixed, little broad
She make my dick stand like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hit that brake so hard, that I dropped my cigar
Pussy print fat like cash in a wad
I'm lookin like, ""Damn baby girl, don't start!""
I'mma take you to my crib girl and screw you like a fraud
Or maybe get some head while I'm ridin in the car
Either way it go man a nigga gotta bust some
Storin my dollar, a nigga got some dust some
High as the moon, I'mma a goon like Plies
Spray it like Big Oomp spray, dead in your eyes
In your eyes


I'm the one that supply that D
I'm the one that keep freaks with me
I'm the one that be ridin clean
That be on the scene with that Texas tea
I'm the dude that took yo' girl
I'm the fool that changed the world
I'm the mayne with the twelve inches
She love to lick and it made her earl
Always fresh when I'm at the club
Sippin Goose the plan keep a buzz
From the hood so I throw it up
And the other side they don't mess with us
Love a girl that do it right
Make my toes like curly fries
In the bathroom or in the car
Or behind the bar she dy-no-mite~!
Give me head (x4)
In the dorm room make me pass out, in the bed
Give me head (x4)
Wake me up then put me back to sleep, I ain't scared


Ayy~! Three 6, what's happenin, yooo
Hold on, hold on, hold on ho! Stop lenme borrow yo' lips that's what I told her
Girl got that Aquafina with a good head on her shoulder
She whispered boy I'm hungry, so I told her she could come
And I didn't feed her nothin but some dick and bubblegum
She want mo' I give her some, I keep them magnums, I'm strapped
And if she tired, lay down, just place yo' head in my lap
Ay Big Oomp Records on the map, we keep that mouth wide open
I Clarence Carter that pro, from the East to the West I'm strokin
From the North to the South I'm pokin, every time this a hit it gets greater
Two choices that she got to make, she can chew me now or later
I'm 'bout that puh-puh paper, but see I love havin sex

Testin’ My Gangsta,Da Unbreakables,2003.0,"I come from a city where they love to hate, especially on that Triple Six
They see we really got Bentley's and Benz's and they hate the shit
They try to come up over us, the radio even help em' at it
But y'all ain't got no flows, so hang it up you silly rabbits
I'mma keep on hurting you boys, by making this motherfuckin' world rock
Side to fuckin' side it’s been twenty years and man we still ain’t stop
Still ridin' clean, makin' cheese and carrying plastic Glocks
And please don't try to test us cuz you know we'll let these bitches pop
On you hoes, you haters, you niggas really like us
Cuz if you thank us, then you wouldn't try to sound so much like us
I'm the K-I-N-G of that M-P-H-M-S(Memphis)
H-C-P, to the E-N-D, others gone be less
Come prepared, man I swear they wanna be down with my team
Don't let the shit talkin' on them CD's fool you
That ain't what they really mean
The truth can hurt so bad so look in they faces when you play us
And watch how they look, and watch they jaw drop to the pavement
Nigga

Why y'all Test My Gangsta
These bitches Test My Gangsta

Cuz it's on now
Nigga yeah it's on now

Nigga don't you know that Lord can make your life a living hell
And I mean that literally, the place where demon spirits dwell
Empty all the buckshot shells, make your fuckin' body smell
I can fuck you up somewhere, to where you were they cannot tell
Fuck me with me, you fucking with the best and you also fuckin' with the wrong one
I will hit you with the milli-milli gun, got a millimeter gun blow out ya lungs
Like them old Italians, Mafia gangsta son
When you see me coming, better run for fucking cover
BomBLAY, AK, SK, .44, Tre-8
This body kinda heavy, D.O.A., air away
Bitch you better take notes, 'fo you end up cut-throat
And ya on the ground bro', with your fuckin' shirt soaked
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, blow a nigga out his clothes
Come out the trench coat with a sawed-off, and lay me down a ho
So if you think Scarecrow ain't a gangsta, come and test the water
You will be the slaughtered, the dearly departed

Why y'all Test My Gangsta
These bitches Test My Gangsta
(Repeat 8x)
Cuz it's on now
Nigga yeah it's on now
(Repeat 4x)

Why you niggas wanna test my gangsta?
Don't make a nigga run up and shank ya
Or put some cement in yo shit and sank ya
Or make you shoot yourself and then I'm thankin' ya
Throw tile over round your throat and drag ya cuz
Get nothing from me, but gangsta love
No testin' me my nigga, have you laying in blood
Or dig you a grave, cut ya bitch ass up
 ({Yeah Ho!} repeated threw the verse)
You niggas be trying to test, I ain't no slouch
I squeeze my fuckin' fist, my nig', I break the law
I call out a hit my nig', I make the fall
The handle with the bloody trig', is all they saw
'Fo yo ugly face was down, on the ground
A barrel pointed at your frown, with hollow rounds
I bet ya wanna run and shit, it's too late now
You shouldn't have been runnin' ya lip, to make me clown

But I'm maintaining still drankin' hatin' I can't destroy
Every time I ride all I hear is ""fuck witcha boy!""

Late last night lyin' in the bed, eyes red
Thinkin' should I get these hoes, thinkin' should I cut they head?
Should a nigga plan a hit or grab my pistol grip
And take care my business cause they don't know who they fuckin' with
Call my nigga Project Pat cause I know he got my back
Fuck writin' rhymes, this is real shit not a track
Camouflage in the dark for the ones who act hard
The devil on my left side, the other side I'm seeing God
Why do niggas talk shit, never tryin' to stick together
Murder in the city streets make you fools feel better
So I just walk in a pace thinkin' of a case to get a bitch erased
Chrome to your fuckin' face
This ain't no game nigga, my finger is on the trigger
Your time is runnin' out, my conscious say I gotta get em'
Is there a way that a nigga can escape from hell
I fuck em' up with the Mossberg buckshells

So beware of this gangsta shit
Enough has been said
Got you scared so I'm endin' this

See I done built me a two story house up on a rock
I done slept in the park, changed my clothes six o' clock
Got a pocket full of knowledge
Bitch, count my head and sense
I got that whole wide world in my hand
Spin that ten as a trill rock, still for that bill
Hard to kill motherfucker Koopsta mentally ill
Still (??) in my face and bitch best not say shit
I'm yelling quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick
Quick, quick , quick hold all my power
Stayin' blastin' bitch dip into a crystal rub
That tough I've been seen his face, face thinkin' nigga
Fest for he wishes than just vanity
In my pit with the deadlock on bitch and I'm peekin' now

Walk up to your house
Knock on your door
And blow your ass off
Walk up to your house
Knock on your door

Checkin' us out while tap on the door
Kickin' them down, make 'em all hit the floor
Innocent victims are shuttin' their door
Leavin' all drippin' in bloody war
Run in the hallways look in the room
Soakin' away them bloody pools
Check for the posse they hidden up there
Popped with a pillow case uder their tools
Put a big bullet behind every ear
Don't want no moaning, don't want no tears
Telephone cords; I took out the wall
No one can stop all the terror in here
From the five foot five slut doggin' alcoholic
Mind enchanted door kickin' evil nigga named Lord Infamous
Niggas without knowledge do not recognize the ultimate
I'm getting into drama with the coroner cooler serious
Draggin' dead bodies in back of my grey Chevrolet
On the way to send her mammy flowers with a bomb in a bouqet

I just can't stop
I keep on loading my gun
I can't be seein' masta stopa
Till I fill and I come
Cause I ain't no sitcom

Let me squeeze it, Let me squeeze it
(All you ladies pop your pussy like this) Yeah
(Shake your body don't stop don't miss)

Mane she got me in the zone when I watch this broad pass by
Been becking at this bitch all night but this my last try
I am trying to see what's up
You know a nigga trying to fuck
If you are a girlie girl then I'll settle for a suck
You got a thug on the scene
In the club on some green
A nigga ain't Ginuwine
But trying to get up in them jeans
Frayser Boy that's the name
Fuck another I'm the mane
Get you drank after drank get you drunk I'm trying to bang

Where ya at whoa
Where ya at whoa
CB wanna hit you from the back whoa
And when I grab your girl don't holla let go
Cause I like a girl with a big back bro
I mean she stacked low
And when I jacked yo
I shoot that thang like I'm shooting off a Mac whoa
It ain't no game I play when it come to D
And if you get it from me then you getting dope D'd


Juicy J is pimpy
Not always all friendly
I wanna get that chewin like from Monica Lewinsky
She can call me (papi) hanging low and (floppy)
When I get behind that ass she tell me (boy you got me)
I don't care for size four
I just want a size more
Big ol J-Lo booty what a wedding good she sized or
Bring it up (Bring it up)
Back it back (Back it back)
Make it wiggle (Make it wiggle)
Make it jiggle make it clap

Let me squeeze it
Ain't no teasing
Go to get it
I done seen it
Soon as she drop it on the floor
It's over for this one this evening
I might leave it
Sticky drippin up out of the side of her secret
Victoria probably gone be pissed when ever she sees it
But once you got me going it's on
Ain't no reason for you be wanting to go home
You gotta give it to me nice and round that big J-Lo booty
I need it badly
I'll be happy
Drop it off she a cutie


(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
I'm looking for them J-Lo booties
But I ain't Ben Affleck
And I ain't Diddy
And I ain't the dude who taught her to dance like that
I'm just a dirty dirty down south gold mouth nigga
Can't remember the last time I only saw six figures
I bang a bad big booty thang daily
I did more stars than that boy Carson Daily
And if you nice you ain't even gotta pay me
But if you ugly hit the bank and try to save me

I know this broad, she lick the Infamous so good she make me wanna cry
And if she wasn't such a dog I'd hit her doggy every night
They put the ""frea"" in freak, they put the ""ut"" in slut
They put the ""amp"" in tramp and catch you when I take off the glove
She give brain insane, I call the dame a brainiac
Let me meet the family, all the women nymphomaniacs
She got the biggest brown round that you ever seen

Smiles can be deceivin', even if it's your friends
And hoes that know we can't be even Steven
Should not believe in
Too late one of them slip it's my foes
You already got my Glock to the back of your head
Prayers already said, done consider yourself dead
Your family and friends might be sayin' that I crossed you out
But nigga you was fake from the beginning
So I had to toss you out
Friend I'm no more, I kill all you foes
Step in my trunk, once again on a stroll
Forty mag to yo back
The hammer release and leave your chest with holes
All in the club with that buck ass shit
You want the mic? Then I'mma slap you with the mic, bitch
You couldn't rock it with a test tube and a pot
It's kind of hard, you can't beat us
And you can't join us
Cause we ain't gonna stop if you don't stop

Summon superior astronomical beings from that of my mystical dreams
Of the menacing, mighty, manipulative, merciless, multiple murderers
Imagine dangerous hittin' the strip' and a critical injury
Misery, seriously witness the tremoring
Tragedy, agony, infamy, agony, brutal mentality
Assassin team
My voodoo tribe
If he wants to be fried put on a friendly disguise
Lord Infamous takin' no prisoners
Forget the begging, pleading, and the cries
Your reservation revalation
A satanic nation has been prophesized
I can look in your eyes and tell that there is fear
From the eternal burning of each of your lies
Flights of headlights, black clothes and limos
Another negro startin' to decompose
On his casket the Scarecrow shall place him a lovely black rose
Who knows the hate that goes behind closed doors
With corpses froze in six foot holes
Wicked souls, evil flows and torturing of foes

I have to tell these niggas time and time again
Bitch I ain't your fuckin' friend
I'll do your ass in

Yeah, I ain't your fuckin' friend
We'll do your ass here nigga

Fuck that nigga and his whole damn neighborhood

And when I do that I'maa aim then fuck ya
Smilin in my face aww mane I'ma bust a
Cap in yo ass that's for fuckin with me nigga

A killa is a nigga who will look you in the eye
Put the pistol in your face and let the pistol meet the fly
But I don't think so you betta not try
I'm throwin out hope like a kamikaze pilot
My eyelid is raised and I got you in focus
Put you on a daze all you punk ass jokers

I'm about my home when it comes to stayin down
Use to be my road dogg
Now you just another clown
Hangin round you
Was a very very dumb mistake
Thought you was a real nigga
But you was another fake
Busta, musta wanna be thugster
I'm a label you as a dead motherfucker
Fuckin with a nigga like Pat
You can die hoe
When I come out with the gat
I'ma try hoe
All of my might just to put you six under
Lookin for a fight
I'm a break out with the thunder
Sound of a Glock 38
What you gonna do
Last sound that you hear (boom)
Mark ass niggas frontin like they gonna blast
Don't make a nigga like me run and kill yo ass",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-fuck-that-nigga-lyrics

Pimpin' and robbin' and droppin' these suckas like ducks, bitch
Ain't no money comin' quicker than that hoe money

Pimp them sluts, break them hoes
Ride clean, smoke your dope
Dipped in gold on them Vogues
Ever since that I'm chargin' hoes
Bonin', conin', playas only catch this game that I spit
Playa hatin' niggas we smoke
My pretty boy smile don't joke
We scope, my .44 under the crush
Don't you bite the dust, fuckin' with us
Niggas, leave your name on your block up bitch
But I don't get into that gangsta shit
I relax like a pimp and mack
Hit them trizacks jumpin' (Income means fiends coming)
The skinny nigga in the house, breakin' bitches down
When I drive in the Bonneville, smokin' on a match
We chokin', talkin', loc'in', talkin' crazy to my bitch
I'm walkin' with a limp, with my cane
Spittin' that game, makin' stangs
Give me some! (Mane, I'm fucked up playa)
That's why you ridin' clean
Frontin' niggas kills me, fakin' like they heavy
If you ain't makin' stangs, sell me all your jewelry
I'm outtie, my shortie is clean with them hammer thangs
My nigga Rickie, dipped in gold, sho' nuff rollin' that weed

Pimpin' and robbin' and droppin' these suckas like ducks, bitch
Ain't no money comin' quicker than that hoe money

Give me somethin' bitch, I'm talkin' about dollar signs
Look here ho, I don't wanna fuck, ? but a buck, buck, buck
A shootin' gangsta, light that ass up
Let's play a game called pimpin' and robbin'
Mobbin', pimpin' ain't never stoppin'
Leanin' to the curb, slam goes my car door
Nothin' behind my head but a bumpin' system
And a few of my hoes
Drop me off some cheese
Hit 'em with somethin' to keep 'em pretty
Groupie, droopie, drawed ass bitches, don't act siddity
Find you a trick and break him down
And keep him no. 1 chewer
If my ends don't meet, bitch you get your ass beat
Swisher Sweets, spliff, get a whiff of that Indo blast
Rims gleamin' on the pavement, catchin' eyes when I pass
Downin' some Hennessy
A friend of me is some money though
Romance with no finance is a nuisance, fuck that honey tho'
Droppin' bombs, packin' tones for playas to killaz and macks
Skull peelaz, rollin', ho pullin', muthafucka, can you buy that?

Slob on my cat
Cause you know it's fat
Check in with me
And do that
(Juicy J)
Wait a second freak
I know you from the streets
My nigga Hurry T
Has seen you through his mean
They call you little red
The one who slobs on head
And drinks a niggas nut
Until you well and fed
To see what she's about
I creaped to her house
To catch her in her blouse
And see how big her mouth
She pulled me to her room
To get the fuckin soon
I didn't have a rubber
I fucked with two balloons
Lay on the bed
That's all she said
Her pussy has one problem
Twisted tight in streads
The fucken sounds were tunes
I fucked her with a broom
She rode it like a horse
The blood came rushing soon
When I seen that
I didn't want the cat
So I found out
And never came back
(Chorus)
Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks on dick
Does it real good
Sucks sucks on dick
Does it real good

My nigga D Magic
Had said he finally got it
The true and false blow
He said he had to have it
Know a little freak
In big ham
Licks up nuts
Like lickin stamps
She'll grant your wishes
Blow you freaky kisses
House full of G's
Freak horse bitches
Had the little freak
In my niggas jeep
Try to spit some game
To get her suck some meat
Lay on the cover
My natural hair she loved it
Stop bitch stop bitch
Please don't touch it
Took her trough some hoods
And let her hoe around
7 street 9 street
And street of walks and brown
Now she's in click
A pro on suckin dick
Until the rugged out
The bitch was smokin bricks
Straight trough the blow pipes

Runnin from the rehab
Never got caught",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-slob-on-my-knob-part-2-lyrics

Dodge the cops they labeled it another closing shop
Open it up for closin it up I don't give a fuck
On a daily basis I be postin it up
Smokin it up choppin it to match it wit dub
Give us a club Six mane tearin it up

They locked me up just like 2Pac and I went plat-ti-num
Laid it down for a calendar I'm right back at them
Took my game then weighed it up on a triple beam
Niggas rob kill steal for the ghet-ty green
U.S.. Marshal at my folks house want to kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box bullet in my head
I'm was like ""I ain't did shit why you hatin this?""
Ghetto thugs know my rap songs they relate to this

I been doin this too long to still be strugglin livin like this
Fuckin off with major labels slayed me like a bitch
And these got cheese and ride on Rolls it mean hoes
But still on the road doin free shows
Tryna get a few spins in a few spots
I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my Glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
Thats because they record company wouldn't spend dough
Yeah my label got a hook up wit MTV
But they just keep forgettin to tell 'em bout me
They try to play like it's love and its family
But all my marketing dollars goin to {****}

I'm on top this shit though, check this place
And I came with Juice Man can scratch
Tired of the scam, fucked up his chest
Alcatraz, give me some, plus I'm on the dub
They might know we on edge and why fuck the frown
While these groupie ass bitches be suckin' our dick
Prophet Posse we made it bitch
K-Roc we rockin' wit empty (??)
May kick in this shit that you can't understand
To bad that bitch is a want to be killa
We murder the bitch and fall out of the fame

I got six digits on my bank statement, rock
Eight if you be includin' the two behind the dot
So how they thinkin' they gon' stand up to the six
I spend a hundred GBs to artillerize this click
Candid cameras be in the trees
Of my domain
So I can feel safe when I'm goin' off that uzi mayne
Go low mass Suburban, uh, go low mass and Impala, nuh
I can brag for days but because you nosey hoes
I'm stoppin' uh

Head back to bisac have they take him to woods
Them goons ate his body the body's no good

You fake mothafuckas, we gonna finish what you started
Your heart is a nickle sack, bitch you best to have a gat
Smoke a nigga with that trigga, Memphis nigga Project Pat
I'm down like the Kami Kaze soldier on a killing spree
Once we get into it dog, you gon' have to murder me
Who I be, I'm hiding in the bushes laying, push us
To the ground, ghetto clown, off your blood you shall drown


To be or not to be, now the Koopsta's off the streets
Only real G's close to me is my Celly
Jealous ass folks, tryna take me as a joke
But this pimp shit bitch, can't go I ti-zook all of you hoes
Loading up my mind, daily fucking my patience
Running from my visitations, just the coo fool can ya face me
Claim to be my friend, when ya taking a second look
I guess it's on then big bizness bitch, no money on my book
Mane this shit is hectic, so I'm calling up to God
Me and my charge partna booga, he's a rapper down with us
Party Cell 17's where I dwell
Stale (?) on my shelf, I'm felling as if I'm in hell
Yeah, soon I be bailed, bailed well living swell
Triple platinum with the Phantom, deja vu, fuck when I left
Oh me isn't this a binitch, please excuse me for my French
But you writing all these lyrics, if ya hear me then ya feel me


In the hood where I dwell and I dwell real well
For you playa hating ass bitches
Mane you might as well burn in hell
When you smell the aroma from them blunts
When I hit corners
Don't you duck, don't you dodge, cause it's only gonna be
Murder-murder on my mind, leaving blank in the pass
When you drop that fucking glass, mane I bet ya I kill your ass
Nigga pop with the Glock in a pine fucking box
Don't you try to call the fucking cop
Cause a nigga ain't gon' stop

Shooting, capping, jack and chill
Letting you so calleds know the deal
Hollow tips yo ass gonna feel, roll your dice bitch and you real
Fucking with the click, the crew, the clan, you gon' recognize
G's swanging out their trees, have you stanking with the flies
Cries coming up out your mouth, but they muffled by the tone
When I pull the trigga back, you enter the enternal zone
Southside killers, always staying strapped with them thangs
Project Pat, Memphis, Tennessee, where them killers hang",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-where-da-killaz-hang-lyrics

Because first of all everything is business, ain't shit personal
A hundred times I caught your ass slippin'
All high off the drugs I could've start trippin' and rippin' your head off
With the tech 9, but you don't hear it
Trying to test my pimpin' I'll run up on you
Cockin' it, you will feel it poking up your nose, boogers on my barrel
Pull the trigger back and watch your head just scatter
Go to the funeral cause some shit like that it's straight to me
Ridin' in the limo with yo folks 'till you tried to play me
Bitch I don't fuck around, I'll put your ass underground
You know you goodas gone when you hear the (gunshots) sound
You run your mouth, but you'll eventually have to pay the cost
For talkin' your funky ass off, busta'!

Sayin' what they do but never doin' it

And if you don't believe me just try me
I bet your sissy ass get ran up by the Triple 6 Mafia
Got you fools, petty fools complain, oh come the Scarecrow
With the shit all of us in' the thangs
And my niggas down, my niggas down to clown
Oh you? Oh you to? You don't have a fucking clue, fool
You just talk a lot of shit, but shit don't impress me
You better bring it on if you willin' to try and even test me

Automatic rounds coming at you from every end, watch your head bust!

Bud by the pound
Smoke a mothafuckin' ounce
A mean ass crib
All digital studio
And some down ass hoes for the road
I want it all or nothin'
I want it all or nothin'
They bitches with a punch bowl of weed
I call it bud in bed
On the spread
Plenty cash
Dumpin' blunt ashes on they ass
A bed with hydraulics
Liqour cause I'm alcoholic
No college for my knowledge
Cause I knew how to make profits
Don't like expensive clothes
Just the gangsta aparrel
Grab my route foul
As I walk down the threshold
Black as a shadow
Smoke loc vehicle
Hit Triple 6 up on my motorola portable
Keepin' it key low pro flow
In the studio
Part time jiggalo
Rock a show to make some dough

Mafios a gangsta pimp playa
Got on my brand new scarecrow underwear
600 acre marajuana field in my backyard
Smokin banana leaves on my lawn chair
Playa cause a room
Full of mothafuckin' bombs and artillery
All fuckin' century I need

Plenty money and dope
Alot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
I want it all or nothin'

Back in the days I was broke
No joke
Fucked up in town
No g's no hope
A nigga used to hike home from school
On the bike trail
Wishin' one day this rap shit'll probably make me bail
Lil' ??? was the niggas I used to hang with
Andre and Big Trese
North Memphis bound bitch
Hangin' on Evergreen corners
Holdin' my fuckin' nuts
Watchin' freaks walk by
Sayin dirty bitch wassup
But they wasn't goin'
Cause they want a nigga sellin' yam
A mean four way
With the grain wood his ass in
95.0 chevy thang with the vogues
But I used to catch the bus
And lounge and the china store
I just couldn't wait
Tryin' to rap to get my final break
Juicy J AKA The Juice I want it on my tape
Sell and make money
So the niggas in my hood'll know
Any one wanna ride I'll be singin' this chorus

Plenty money and dope
Alot of fine hoes
A fresh car and crib
That's how I like to live
I want it all or nothin'

In the nine-five
I decided fuck this underground tape shit
Stack some cheese
So quit puts on my disses
Tryin' to break bitch
Kinda quick kinda fast
To a bigger studio
Bullshit producers tryin' to fuck me up my asshole
Tradin' ass niggas sayin' they do
This and that for me
If you ain't for real
Then keep it to yourself
Cause see I ain't got time
Plus ain't in a mood for playin no fuckin games
You cross me somethin and I dont get it
I gotta lay it down
But I ain't and I'm not nigga
I gotta make more than I did in the 9
For whatever it takes it won't be easy
Cause in they never why
In dough it better stay like this
Or get greater
Cause if a nigga fuck me now
I promise he pay for it later
That's why I beat you to my game
And I learned the business
Cause you will straight be missin'
Without a witness
I want a pound of weed
And a candy face in the den
A bank account readin' a mill
And a 95 Benz

You got to be the weakest ho in the world
You move all the way to Memphis from *gunshots* (Atlanta)
Cause you were scared like a little girl
Little sorry broke bitch ass nigga
You ran your mouth and got into it with some real ass niggas
You landed in the ""M"" and saw your life was in ruins
By the way nigga, how your collarbone doing
?
I thought you knew really quick to kick some ass down here
Memphis, Tenn. I'll take the base out of it and say so clear
Then you move back to *gunshots* (Atlanta) you got your car shot up
While you were driving you living a life of hell
I guess you wanted to be so much like your favorite rapper
That you even try to die like your favorite rapper
At ninety pounds you're too small
For the trouble you found
You're gon' fuck around and find yourself under the ground
I wanted to get in that ass so I invite you to a show
But you's a ho because your ass didn't show 
you ain't buck bitch!

This right here won't stay quiet
It might strike up a riot
Everytime we bump this shit somebody up in here die
The dangerous Hypnotize is from the deadliest Minds
We are the rowdiest of hypnotists out here you will find
You better fuck with your kind
You do not want none of mine
We're the funkiest, bumpiest out on the grind
This is one your sitting in your junk get ya crunk
We're the specialist Triple six out on the funk
So hit the floor and give me about one hundred jawbreakers
We're causing pain up on this thang you can't shake us
I'm pistol-whipping, self-tripping furiously fast
Hit the gas, the cash I'll give them a blast
In the past, Three 6 have you beating 'em bad
Just like the old shit you holding niggas up in a mask
Hit the parking lot, pop the boys
Straight Homicide
It be these killers man, these killers man 'bout to

First, I've had you niggas get buck, get wild
Then I want you niggas to move the fucking crowd
Three 6 in this bitch knock a nigga down
My nigga on the right, get buck, get wild
My nigga on the left, smack a bitch in the mouth
My nigga on top turn it to the ground
For all you hoes walk around with a frown
We gonna play a game called ""Beat a bitch down""

Bitch I know It's 'bout that cash when you selling your ass
You done spent your whole check walking around acting mad
Heard you be at ATL, Magic City It's sad
To cover up it's just a flauge like you ain't like the past
You say you down with the goodbook
I think you read a cookbook
I know you need some help you need to go see Dr. Hoodshook
And please quit claiming the low down dirty Three 6
When you telling motherfuckers you ain't with it bitch!

Knowin' by the hour I be choppin' up my bag of herbs

Till the nigga pulled his car to the side and start to run

Please don't test these murderers
Slugs I will pump at your gut
Scan from the Killa Klan Kaze
I will dump your bodyparts into my trunk
Let's go ride then play a game
What's the game
The game of names
Now which, which one would you choose
Which ever you choose you lose, you lose

First time on the mic, so I'ma come real, trick
You see them hatas talk shit but they don't know the deal
Dope sella
BHZ's where I dwell-ah
They looked into the barrel of my chin black Barretta
Ratta Tatta is all you heard
To see you niggas comin' up and they want to splurge
But watch the game
Cause you don't got no friends
Droopy Drew Dog self made to the end

Check this here
Niggas will, rob and steal, mob and kill
And it feel
They don't feel
What I feel, then I fill
Them up with
Bullet lead two to the head
Then I lay them in graves
That I dig
Just for them
Yes it is

Slammin' bones, throwin' licks
Puttin' bitches in there clicks
Kaze in this motherfucker
Down with the Prophet click
Clack boom doom for you hatas hatin' realness
Mossberg slug to your grill
You gone feel this
Trigger happy, nappy headed, sell that dope you sent me
Project Pat is down
But ain't no fuckin' damn fool
We riding, chiefing, dranking, bodies stanking, I can smell it well
And if the police pull us over I'm the first to bail

Jackin' and packin', attackin' those fakin' ass bitches
That think they some thing, I know they so broke
I'm leaving them red instead
While I chop this track up like i'm Freddy
Straight from very bone
Til a motherfucka fall out on his face
See Triple 6, It's on
Bitch every month up in the source bar
I don't wanna kill a motherfucker
Betta get a motherfucker for talkin' that shit
Huh, I don't wanna kill a motherfucker
Betta get a motherfucker for crossin' my click bitch
Boogety boogety bang bang nigga blew your brains
On the motherfuckin' wood grain nigga
Pullin' the trigga like uhh die nigga uhh die nigga

Motherfucker, I'm K-Rock
I dump them body parts into my trunk
See me after Killa Klan
See when that K-Rock solo bump
Wakin' up in my dream
Prophet Posse my niggas
Gimme that forty Glock
In my pajamas pullin' that trigga
I see traitors, stupid-ass player haters
Faking while we blast our gat
I don't know your ass
Therefore, automatic weapons commence to blast
If a nigga don't believe me, trick afraid in front of that car
To that ditch
I dumped all his body parts into my trunk",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-bodyparts-2-lyrics

Blew your gotdamn brains
In your partner's lap

Choose your weapons, but boy choose them carefully
Each of my poisons are deadlier melodies
I am the doctor and this is your therapy
You can have one so you must get a pair of these
Beat, bound and gagged bump off bounty
Place all his pieces all over county
The shit's very lethal that I place in the needle
Prepare you for your last trip to the Cathedral

I seen how TV can hurt
And plus platinum plaques to match
And add them twenties and vogues
And Gucci jackets on backs
We got them Bentlys and Benzes
And all them Lexus on lock
The picture gettin' kind of clearer
I see why them bitches hot
You hoes is strugglin' and starvin'
And wanna rise in the hood
It's cold I'm crankin' up heat
And you wish you could
Y'all wish y'all could get back with us
Then maybe then you could shine
Like the rappers you wish you was
And get off the grind
I'm keepin' one in the chamber
Because I'm filled up with anger
And when I see yo little ho 'n'
You knowin' your life's in danger
I do a show y'all in the burough
Hollerin' no kind of shit
Is that the best way that you know
To get attention lil bitch
I understand how they feel
They feelin' that they left out
And we the ones movin' on

But niggas keep it your best
And one day then you'll get a crown
But until then do a hit of coke
And keep feelin' down

Good Stuff,Chapter 1: The End,1996.0,"Where ya been all my life, I need ya bad, I've been searchin' for ya
That good ol' stuff, I can't get enough, you know I been yearnin' for ya
Call me a junky that's sprung
Dopehead instead of rich bum
Young son that's full of that come
Me needs a one and a one
I gotta get'cha what ever it takes
Gotta hit your big ol snizzow flake
I take you how ever you might be
Pack, dollar, pill away
You know you got me feelin' good
Drop top down up in through the hood
Ask me about a whole key
And man I tell ya I wish I could
It's all to the good, I think I'm numb
(?) don't ask for none
Give me that razor that plate the lazer man
I need my medicine
That pulls me oh some nice and slow
Got me some stallion knockin' at the door
Better get ready for a all-nighter
You know how I be when I'm on that blow

Essence of the blessin's keep me puzzled like enigma
My partner put me down with a (?) pound of compressed cheeba
My smoke it floats like disco music to nose from mysterious chiefa
On Halloween I pass it out to all the trick or treaters
In 1999 the middle east will come nuclear bomb us
So now Lord Infamous blastin out with Sitting Bull and Pocahontas
Smoke out your lungs and powder your nose
We grabbin' big bushes or sometimes we kick it
We breaking down seeds and we breaking down sticks
And we breaking down cigars and make 'em all stick
Triple 6 Mafia gettin' so rowdy because we are out of this atmosphere
With all da smoke in here eyes are blurry, bloodred, shedding tears
Cops on the right, on the left, to the rear
Scarecrow me keep clouds of smoke flyin' out of me lungs
Me keep these spices sprinkled down like a kick drum

Gimme some of that good stuff
Gimme somethin' that'll feel kinda special
Gimme somethin' that'll do it
Do it, Put my mind to it
Until we get high

I keep that good stuff (lady what you mean)
Good stuff of that light green
Everytime you see me, eyes are red but still I'm on my p's
Smokin', gettin' motivated, just chillin' with nuthin' but playas
Slick as I can be, relaxed and bumpin' some Johnny Taylor
Feelin' good as hell
It's so swell
High, this stuff has got me goosed up
Got me wantin' some good lovin' so I call my shorty
Baby, baby come and give it to me, give it to me right
Comin' with the quickness, got you speachless to this freaky night
Still I'm stayin' bout it, never hang with bustas so can't you see
Solo? Never sucka, always catch me with the Prophet P
Gone remain his lady Kinda crazy So don't test me
I will buck your bro down when that good stuff got me in the skies

(What you got down in your trunk?)
Nothin' but good stuff known as funk
Guaranteed to keep you up
Make you hyper super crunk
Let me know on what you need
I'm cuttin'em deals, come shop with me
Your partner used to pluck you twice
I'm giving out samples and it's free
Package deals from state to state
The ice cream man who deliver that cake
You wanna get a piece to shake
The bigger the plate, the heavier the blade
The thicker the cheese, the more you can take
On and on gotta keep that pace
From scene to scene, supplyin' that D
Some of that pure, but none of that bakin' soda
Soldiers die, they fall
They get with the man if you want to get bloated
Just like taking a sniff of roses
This lil sniff will keep ya rollin'
Up all night to the early mornin'
Constantly movin', never yawnin'
Burnin' my people on every pay phone
And for that good stuff super joanin'

I be like in the wind, I'm gon' holler at ya friend
Must have them twins, da Henn' and a bunch of birtches with yo man
So I can get into the groove that keeps Koop spooky
Juicy's constantly speakin' to me though he ain't sayin' nothin'
Man it may be the chronic, that funny or the super bionic
Sick here wanna sit here fartin' like I'm a motor or somethin'
Is it the swisher, I cannot remember, yes sir it's understood
Koop must done got a little bit of hit of somethin' good

Gimme some of that good stuff
Gimme somethin' that'll feel kinda special
Gimme somethin' that'll do it
Do it, Put my mind to it

Flodgin' round town, talkin' about what they gonna do

Slang N Serve,Choices: The Album,2001.0,"ATL niggas (repeated throughout the song)

I'm on an everlasting money mission, million dollar premonition
Got my own coalition, pack my own ammunition
20's on the Lexus glisten, I'm driven to mob life
Hella niggas want me murdered, but can't do the job right
Razor blades, Ak's, and ask me do I carry them
Killin for a hobby like a medieval barbarian
When will the disaster stop? Never, nigga pass the Glock
Illustrated killin live in color like its magnavox
Now I got em hot, from the plot to put the block on lock
Set up shop wit over 50, 000 dollars worth of rocks
Ammunition cocked prepared to pop, Ill even shoot at cops
Stash away the heat and then retreat off in my drop top
Find yo own bizness, or the gat'll make yo clock stop
187 from the west and get yo fuckin block mopped
You gone have to tangle wit a Hypnotize enterprise
Good for makin money off the shit to stay the fuck alive
x4
Come smoke some herb wit me
Come flip a bird wit me
Step on the curb wit me
Come slang n serve wit me

I only fuck wit real niggas, all the haters can burn in hell
If you ain't affiliated, dont come wit packs to sell
Object of this hustlin is bubbling stacks of mail
Situations turn sour, rivals'll blast then bail
When I hit the block I'm seein J's, driven insane
Crunker than Montana wit some anna for ounces of caine
ATL niggas blowin brains, simple and plain
Sippin golden grain, makin stangs, inflictin the pain
Smokin, gettin into it, livin ruthless, the feds are clueless
We the ones who keep the city crunker than engine fluid
Hypnotize niggas ridin vettes, sippin moets
Strapped up wit a vest and giant tecs to lower the stress
51 niggas got my back, so nevertheless
Ima get this anna off my chest and smoke on this cest
Puttin bitches on the track, when its a pimp in the flesh
Solid as a rock for adversaries who wishin to test


My scandalous recipe, make niggas be scared of me
If there has been treachery, dont try to get next to me
Yo life is in jeopardy, when fuckin wit family
We turnin psychotic losin all of our insanity
Brain dead off of greenery, releasin the steam in me
Keep me from the weapons, Ill be fuckin up the scenery
Deport bullets like immigrants, bitch niggas dont 'tempt to flinch
Money is the motive, let my sinning end the innocence
Ima let the missile rip, ballistic wit hollow tips
You won't see me comin, keep yo fingers on the pistol grip
Smoke blindin my enemies, give em fearful tendencies
You can kiss they life goodbye when T-Rock hit the Hennessy
I'm in it for the presidents, luxurious residence
Hooked up wit the camp, Ive been a mercenary ever since
Atlanta my stompin grounds, Old National's where I'm found
Moving bricks, and fuckin tricks, and flippin reefer by the pounds!!!

Who we got in here: Juicy J, Lil Wyte, Frayser Boy, Crunchy Black
Lord Infamous and me DJ Paul the King of Memphis

Nigga we some maniacs, fuckin up our brainiacs

Vodka mix with Smilak, take a gun and cock it back
Now I'm bout to blow my brains out cause I dont give a shat
Hope you give a nigga reason to wet ya
, the bigger gun the better
The more shit you talk, the more blood the sweater
The plane crashes, the devil, the anthrax, the letters
Forgot about the peddlers, we still in it together

Let me introduce myself, my fuckin nigga
I'mma be the one to pull that fuckin trigga
I'mma be the one that's sent to fuckin getcha
You better watch out cause I'll paint a picture
A pretty little picture now how a nigga getcha
Lock you in the trunk and take care of my business
Paul and Juicy sent me so you know its big business

Yeah, make me a believer nigga
Make some shit this bumpin you fuckin wannabes, Lord roll!

I am the predator you are the prey
You play the target, Lord play the gauge
You play bitches and I mack hoes
You run from niggas, I find the snub nose

And you can't sell three copies of your shit
You smoke babbage weed and cheap packs of blow
You own a vehicle, pick up the Scarecrow

Frayser Boy, cockin toy, y'all dont wanna fuck with me
Infared got ya scared, in protective custody

Time to damage shit, no understandin this, you know you scandalous
HCP blowin your lights out like a candle bitch

Well I'm about to rip a hole in the industry, holdin' my energy
Wasn't about to let it out but y'all had to come testin me
Givin you one warning change your name before I get your crunk
Lyrically copyrighted all my shit and plus I'll fuck you up
You dont want to have to cross the path of killers when you on the streets

Catch you in these fuckin streets boy and ima point the chrome
Put you in the fuckin car ho, and we gon take you home
To hell with all that cryin now nigga we gonna get it on
Beat you with that yawk dead center across your damn dome
The way you ran your mouth, you shouldve known to have the fuckin tone
Beggin from beginning, man winnin cause our camp is strong
The same way your skull started dentin cause we beat it long
You niggas swear you have the right plan but you had the wrong mans
Tryin to build a clique like the hypnotize camp
Im knowin it wouldn't work so I just sit back
And watch how the trains just runs off the track

Come down on lower level actin like they hard
Off the street ass punk! yaint bout shit nigga!

Got 4 mo muthafuckin days nigga
Go get yo ass delt with biatch!
Nigga gone get yo mufuckin ass put in a piledriver nigga
Bring it to the floor muthafucka
You can't fuck wit dis pimp nigga (woof woof grrrrrrr)
Don't get yo ass put into a motherfuckin piledriver
Like I said aaaaa

It started out in 201 lock down, me and Paul in a holding cell
Waitin' to use the fuckin phone, waitin' to get a fuckin bail
Some people think 201 is just a place for cops and robbers
Niggas still smoke weed constantly, passing dollars
Mace in your face when it's time to get buckwild
Cause lawyer fees are high as hell, payin' these can't even help my trial
So while I'm thinkin' to myself, a nigga walked right up to me
Lookin' me up and down with a frown, smellin' like a bottle of Crown
But I dont give a fuck cuz this hoe gon' make me make the news
For shankin' niggas in the neck, whippin' guards and takin' shoes
He threw up a gang sign, I turned my back, didn't pay him no mind
And when I looked around again he threw it up another time
I said ""Yo wassup fool, is there somethin that you're tryin' to prove?""
I ain't wit that gang shit, he smiled and fired up a Kool
Walked a little closer to me, I'mma pull them dreads up outta his head
He didn't show no violent act but in a low tone this is what he said:

Killa, Killa, whatcha gonna do?
Get blessed in the red or get blessed in the blue
On the 34th floor they got them G's claimin true
So whatcha gonna do, young killa

Ya gotta have somebody watchin' somebody else
And them watchin somebody too
While you watchin everybody cuz they ass is out to get you
No matter if you in the dope game or the rap game
Or what situation you're in my friend
There is no such thing as a fuckin friend
Maybe you out to get them, secretly they out to get you
Can't no love be in yo heart, by the way fuck these hoes too
You know they just as devious as negros
That ho don't love yo ass damn fool, if you was broke she'd blow like smoke
And fuck these police ass niggas, snitches pull the sword
Stab you in ya back for a muthafuckin reward
Junky muthafuckers sittin down at the precinct
Lookin at pictures trying to indentify a nigga
On the realla man, this game is so filthy
And everybody guilty, niggas start to tripping
So keep extra clips, see
Man, trust is somethin that I never had much faith in
Cuz fuckin' wit niggas you will end up in the state pen

Killa, Killa, whatcha gonna do?
Get blessed in the red or get blessed in the blue
On the 34th floor they got them G's claimin true
So whatcha gonna do, young killa

Yeah, aww shit they shine them blues up on my candy
They said somebody done dropped the dime but these playa hatas can't stand me
And now my burbons on the record at about eleven
In the back of the car, Im hope'n I see tha 9-7-11
.45 they done brought that dog
Me and Crunchy eye to eye while chris be stuffin his draws
I heard a rumor that damn hound done found my stash pot
I had four juice 'o blow and a infared on my .40 and a Glock
Aww fuck, we on our way to the duece 01 
This shit was cool to rap about but now it ain't so fun
But little do they know ben's made friends
I had to spend plenty of em but we ain't seein no payin at least this shit

Nigga let me ask you are you really down wit yo gang
Or when you get locked up do that shit change?
Now I'm comin real, tryna know the deal bout you killas
Are you just some sheisty niggas that hang around drug dealers
When yo ass be locked up, hoe do you be like doin chores?
For so cockin that you in like BD's and Vice Lords
Let this lady kick some knowledge for niggas that's full of flodgin
Its guaranteed to get fucked up by them real mobsters
Killa killa killa whatcha gonna do, is yo color red or blue
You fucked up, you gonna get stuck up because you ain't true
For that simple reason, found you shakin, bleedin, in yo cell
Now yo ass done bought a one way ticket to a burnin hell

Yeah for you niggas that's thinkin that 201 is a joke

I'm from the grove with my four, see I stay strapped
Never slip and see North Memphis niggas on the map
I got that gauge 38 and that four five Glock
Deep in the bushes see I'm scooping with that red dot
You try to run I'mma cock my gat and blast you
This is a ""Blow a Nigga Ass Off"" part two

Kill a bitch, fuck a hoe, do or die in the nine-four
R.I.D.G.E G.R.O.V.E. bringin' shit to the door
No love lost bitch, North Memphis in the fuckin house
Buckin' busta bitches now you hoes gotta run yo' mouth
My Glock is cocked to pop a punk, motherfucker quick
Trizzick-bizzitch, I just clizzick on a bizzitch on my dizzick
Now hoes better recognize Lil' Glock ain’t no fuckin' joke
No pretty boy smile the gangsta Glock child is goin' out in fuckin' smoke
Ridge Grove in this bitch, hoes gotta pay the cost
North Memphis takin' over, blow a nigga's ass off

Blow a nigga ass off
Ass off, ass off
Buck, buck, buckin' 'em down
Blow a niggas ass off
Blow a nigga ass off
Ass off, ass off
Buck, buck, buckin' 'em down
Blow a niggas ass off
Blow a nigga ass off

Motivated,Chapter 2: World Domination,1997.0,"Everytime I feel this shit, I'm motivated
Not only do we flow this shit, we demonstrate it
We come to far to turn back now, I hope we make it
But everytime them prophets fly, I'm motivated

Back in the days
I used to get down
Pockets on e
I can't do nothin' but frown
Feelin' my belly and don't come around
Had to be pushin' that bope by the pound
Go with da folk that be pullin' a bitch
Not to popular now you know you're the shit
Fuckin' with reala
That know you're legit
Pushin' that shit that you shoot in your wrist
Had ot be down about makin' my grip
Pumpin' the beat
Hopin' the needle won't skip
Nukin' a dinner while flippin' the script
Niggas still trippin' still runnin' they lip
Now they just comin' in larger amounts
Then I stack them in my bank account
This is for half of your ass watch it bounce
Motivation for my power and clout

20 years old
Ridin' in a 80,000 dollar viper
Better watch out for the snipers
They be bumpin' our tapes
But they really don't like us
Why must some local bustas try to dis me
When they don't even know me
Not knowin' i'll run up on they ass
With a motherfuckin' mac
Kill em' all off slowly
I'm tryin' to keep my cool, keep my cool
Cause I got plenty to lose
My fuckin' surroundings be another nigga singin' the blues
So how I keep's myself on top of things and motivate
I quickly erase all you hoes that be playa hatin'

Everytime I feel this shit, I'm motivated
Not only do we flow this shit, we demonstrate it
We come to far to turn back now, I hope we make it
But everytime them prophets fly, I'm motivated

For you motherfuckin' niggas
For you motherfuckin' hoes
Stayin' real as ca be
On my fuckin' ten toes
Never be the one to fall
I'm rising oh so quickly
I know you hate me
But I'm gon' stay motivated
This crazy lady
Don't give a fuck bout' what you say
It don't mean shit
Maybe cause I'm stackin' cheese
And you ain't stackin' nothin' but dicks
Including you niggas too
You be ridin' on dicks
I know you do
I'm stayin' on top of my game
I'll be number one so nigga fuck you

This music game is gonna drive me insane
It's all about figures
Cause when you're dealin' with heavy stakes
Somethin' gon' brake or get injured
Niggas talkin' bout' paying dues
I got the bruises to prove it
Did everything a nigga could do
To make it in the game of rap music
But still everytime I try to make a move some mothefuckers always
Gotta doubt
And then them very same niggas don't know what the fuck they talkin'
Bout'
Keepin' the faith up on my plate
Was the reflection of my face
Sayin' it to make it but still gave the good Lord his grace

We need somehow go up on that joint wit' us mane
I'm tellin you mane

-My nigga Lil Mel will go up on that joint with us dawg

We just got to snatch them bitches mane
Tell 'em ""where the shit at?"" mane, for real mane
-Nigga we can go touch them fool
Let's go touch them foul, we can do that shit now
-'ight, let's ride mane

Psycho in da cut, with da mask and da pistol grip
Psycho in da cut, with da mask and da pistol grip

I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
I know he's bad

As I tip-toe, I tip-toe real slow on the route to them niggas hotel room door
I know that they weighin' up dope and I kick it all in and make all them hoes bloody the floor
Take all they money and coke then I hop in the Steamer and vamp to avoid the 5-0
Nigga don't slip or you get tore up by pistol grip
And I know you don't wanna be smoked by Scarecrow
A pop, it's another big set of three bullets (?) casualty
Just place off all that shit, there won't be no brutality
Hey nigga don't play me for no fool cause I know you got plenty of ends
Don't make pull this trigger and cave yo motherfuckin' face in

""C'mon dawg lemme get some of that dope mane
-Naw bitch
C'mon dawg lemme get some of that cheese mane
-Naw bitch
Aw mane c'mon lemme keep something mane
-Alright my nig'
I tell you what you get: this motherfuckin' bullet trick""

A (?) punk motherfucker gonna take them doses in his chest
Cause Triple Six we cleanin' motherfuckers like the I.R.S
So when Lord Infamous on the creep tour with the big, black gun
I'm gonna reach out and touch someone

I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
I know he's bad

It was on a sunday night, a nigga hit Paul back
He said he had a job for us to do to meet him at the Harleys on the mall and democrat
My girl beeped me, she told me Paul was on his fuckin' way
He hit me on his cellular phone, he's balling down parkway
Paul rolled up in the Chevy thang
I jumped in the back and fired up a dooby mane
And that's when Lil Buck explained
How we gonna touch them hoes, shake them hoes
Put 'em in the Chevy trunk, drop 'em in the nearest junt
Pussy nig in his shoes, dump 'em in a river fool
Tie a rope 'round his skull, drag 'em with a fuckin' boat
Crunchy Black ain't no hoe, nigga you don't hear me though
Easy come, easy go, easily I shoot you hoe

Well Crunchy Black I know you ain't a hoe
But prove it to them bustas that's countin' they fuckin' dough
A rich trick that splurges really needs to be touched, but wait
I tell ya how my robbery spree was created after the break

I gotta touch 'em, I gotta touch 'em
I know he's bad

My life was up and down for the Killa Man as a youngsta
Sellin' dope at age 13 and later gettin' blessed as a gangsta
Sellin' 2 dollar junts at the junior high
Lil near I had pure, I kept the whole school high
Took my little cheese to buy some Fila boots or a cane
Gold and a LL Cool J troop jogging suit
That shit was on back then and trill
My brother Phil D. was boomin' keys
He always thanked me with some (?)
One day the feds kicked his fuckin' door in
(Aww shit) now all the shit done come to an end
Ridin' the strip in a Candy Apple Vette
Or a (?) gold rims and a drop top
But now I gotta think of another plan
I joined up with some trill ass niggas
And the street named me the ""Killa Man""
For fast get-aways I bought a chevy 350 big block
And plus some life insurance
I bought a brand new plastic Glock
Cause my .380 started to jam up like James Brown
I could barely let loose of full three rounds
But now I gotta make 'em lay it down
I gotta make 'em lay it down
The 6 double-6 mobbin' niggas rush
This is the touch",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-gotta-touch-em-pt-1-lyrics

Creeping through yo hood, please don't be so scared
Go and take a look
I got behind the steel, may I be forgived, I didn't mean to kill
Now I wipe your bone and blood off my windshield
I'm sitting in the park, fire on the logs, watching body parts
Burning into sparks, bloodied up my saw

This is strictly for you niggas that need to really hear the fuckin' truth
Bout why you saw Lil E take a chew and chew on some ah that flaky fruit
Mane I hope you brace yourself before we take this bumpy ride
Cause you about to see the Lil E while he's on that wild side
I'm not playin' no game like some of these other niggas like to do
You lookin' a bit serious while I'm snortin' some ah that god damn toot
Just like I said before don't test my pimpin' while I'm on that white
Weed ain't nuthin' but something to slow my roll
The powder get's me hype
Now the powder got some size a bump that'll make you feel superb
Like Montana did when he went down to snort it up out dat bird
Some of y'all niggas out there snort a pack or two and think you straight
You ain't gettin' peel'd 'less it's nothing less you wanna get ate
Balls stacked tall, and don't stall is what I'm all about
When I'm goin' to coke, don't play I'm gettin' p'd out
Ain't no fuckin' around when it come to the dope
Cocaine got me addicted nigga hurry up and pass the dope

Full ah that fuckin' phonk and ink and syrup yeh that's the shit
Takin' that god damn fight strap with that bright is how I'll always be
Blowin' on nothin' less than some of the best of that old potent leaf
I can't think of no other way to do it except the playa way
Constantly buyin' some tissue cause yo nose be blunted from that bay
Sneezin', coughin', drainin' all that comes with blowin' that fire ass hoe
Have a blow out with Lit' E and I bet you'd want to quit that dope
Go in' like the Energizer bunny 24-7 mack
I'm one of them big ballers steadily breakin' out them pitcher packs

It's mafia time

It just ain't stable
My actions are even more shocking and dockin'
Than murder between Kane and Abel
So stick 'em up
Everybody catch the ground
Cause I come from the city of Memphis
It's a rowdy town

Well it's time for them Prophets
Ain't no turning trick
Ah, you fucked up with the wrong kind
Ghetto Boo bitch
Comin' at yo ass
Takin' over 97 this Mrs. Gangsta bitch
Married to this damn Prophet shit

Watch how I pull these bitches
And you know the scareman's blastin' teflon's hit yo' feelin's
Nigga, I'll be damned if I'm gon' miss you
Gaurds of task, so you best react
Cause the Prophets are sprayin' motherfuckin' gats when I blast
When I blast
Them niggas on they back

Excuse me sir
Can I get that card or that drivers' license
I need some two scoops
But not the raisin' of the wisest
Nicest, the feel of my body gets conset like Tyson
Roll them dices
Killin' my brain cells
But fuck it
We sacrificin' blow that shit

Prophet Posse, the Posse bitch

It's that nigga that you love to hate
Deep in the north
Is where I stay, the one notorious Juicy J
I fold ya dogs an chop you away
And get real high to this hear track
Buck wild as hell is how we act
The Prophet Posse is on the attack
So what you haters watch your back

There's no game that I'll play
With your bullshit niggas
Say what your ganna say
But a nigga will kill you
If you disrespect
Then nigga you'll feel me
And I dwell in hell
Catch a nigga like, feel me

Some of these niggas on that doe
Some of these niggas on that hay
What you say, what you say ho
Negro Indo crackin' them swishers daily
It's incredible, incredible, from the car
To the block in the motherfuckin' ghetto
Cheefin' in a meadow
When I'm kickin' a line, I rhyme, and blow yo mind every god damn time

Niggas that come to me (??) attention
Brothers and Prophet the Posse
Cause the Killa Roc and never stoppin' roll in a Viper
Niggas that like to be droppin' (droppin')
Juicy with the two nine, Paul with the forty
Motherfuckers on a paperchas, yeah
Killa from Three 6, K-Roc don't play
Don't play with me baby

We makn' moves in this rap industry
Like a magician

Spill My Blood,Chapter 2: World Domination,1997.0,"Have they come to spill my blood
Have they come to sentence me
Will I leave here with my life my lord
If the law men capture me
Have they come to spill my blood
Have they come to sentence me
Will I live to see the morning sun
If the law men capture me

Lord Infamous, the futuristic rowdy bounty hunter
Nigga, I come from the land down under
Up the from the ground
You don't want to rumble
Or cry round
Toss and tumble
My voodoo do so my poetry
Now chicken blood or poultry
My victim been shook
By a pack of coyote
Soarin' through the night
Down to the trees, packed tight
With two some on shakes
No rubber with a paratroop
In fields with parachutes
Down to the blue
No matter, however, can't hold em' for forever
Dead or alive, with your body, I sprinkle rotten flower petals
Yes the consequences, are your choice, my dred
Cause Lord Infamous will gain
A healthy bounty for your head

I'm wakin' up
Tossin' and turnin'
Like in a scuffle
My words aren't clear, rarely I speak, speak
My voice is muffled, muffled
My hands over my face
They done got me
I'm startin' to feel woozy
They done shot me
The same fools I done creeped on, in his own sleep, sleep
One them hoes survived
Now they creeped on me

Fool we got your ass now
So what's up
Isn't you quiet, just because we got your ass muff
Muffled like bag your mouth
Shouldn't have ran your mouth
Talkin' about you gonna creep
While we was sleep, but it was just no doubt
Now the tables have turned
And in the mist of the morgue
Your funky soul burn nigga

Have they come to spill my blood
Have they come to sentence me
Will I leave here with my life my lord
If the law men capture me
Have they come to spill my blood
Have they come to sentence me
Will I leave here with my life my lord

Ten times out of twelve
Nine times out of ten
Gangsta Boo is in it to win
Prophet rider till the end
Smokin' weed
Gettin' twisted more and sippin' havin' thoughts
Thoughts about a nigga
I remember what that trick had bought
Kept that visine in my purse
Get a rental car from Hertz
Call my niggas from the Three 6, tell em' about the plan first
Ooh weeee
Can it be, another song we done made
Fakin' on no damn jacks
A bitch gots to get paid
Come on prophets, now it's on
Nigga, It's like that home alone
Like white boy fuckin'
Let's go get this bitch
Man nigga gone, done deal stupid trick
Now you know this lady bitch
Swing go gets high
Scott free with your shit

For all the dirt
That I did to my wife
Forgive me, lord
Each and every night
Crooked cops
Pull a gun don't fight
Blow you away, leave you out of sight
Search a nigga from the shirt to pants
Nothin' on me
But a sack ass can
Cannon I, With empty shots
Bucket clean
They find a couple of grams
Tons of dope
That that nigga don't know
The Juice man
Can't be cuttin' no bro
Tried the cuffs
But the nigga didn't go
Broke his throat
With a quick left blow
Now it's on, and the chase begins
Cutting the corner, shirt blowin' in the wind
Dog on my trail
And he pickin' up the scent
K-0 cops
Kill a four-legged friend
Jump in the lex
Voodoo like a hex
Dog confused, in they mind complex
Fuck the red light, ballin' on my set
Cops on my trail, cause I let you rest
Hop in the car, ran two more blocks
Put in reverse, then I heard the gunshots
Doin' a hundred, so I couldn't get popped
Officer friendly, on the trip nonstop

Have they come to spill my blood
Have they come to sentence me
Will I leave here with my life my lord

Not tough enough, to drop on up, now I got that pump at your guts
So if you got your mug on me I'm takin that as a threat
La Chat gone ride down on you hoes and put that tec to ya neck, ho

Pass Dat Shit,Choices II: The Setup,2005.0,"While you sitting there babysitting, conversating with the weed?
(Pass that shit, nigga pass that shit)
Man you fucking the rotation up, just pass the shit to me
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)

It's puff puff, pass, the rules, they still the same
You need to pass the weed dog, you holdin' up the train
Done held the blunt so long, It's getting kinda small
The next blunt that get's rolled, bruh you won't hit it at all
Ain't put a dime on shit, nothin' but lips and finger-tips
Dog contribute to the session mane or you gon' have to dip
And go get in ya whip and lead y'all somewhere else
Shoulda smashed behind yo partner, bruh he already left

Yeah, I smoke weed, that good-good dope
But I hate when niggas be, babysitting that dope
Yeah, I drink yo purple and rolled up Sweets
Take me two puffs then I pass that weed
But remember we on purple so we fall to fucking sleep
So I yelled at my nigga, pass me that green
Don't make me put my foot in yo ass knee-deep
Just do what the song say, nigga pass that weed

While you sitting there babysitting, conversating with the weed?
(Pass that shit, nigga pass that shit)
Man you fucking the rotation up, just pass the shit to me
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
Why you rest having the blunt when I put half up on them trees?
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
I see you one of them niggas that be tryna smoke for free
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)

I can smell it in the air but where the hell's it coming from?
Need it badly, can I hit your blunt? Or simply take a gun?
Simply buy me up the hash and crumble purple-kushy, yum
Bubble-gum or onion, fuck all that man, I want me some
Put the torchy on the dope, just let me sit and have a smoke
Automatic gat, I grab it, just might have it, It's the choke
Know that you don't know me or don't owe me, don't be mean to me
Let a brother come on over and hit some of yo greenery

I'm gettin' tired of smokin' out with traitors
Non-chiefers and conservators
Constantly holdin' on to the weed while I'm tryna get my vapours
Fuck some papers, cigarillos what I like to roll and choke
Babysittin' motherfucka, keep on tokin' and get yo fingers broke
Pass that shit, I know it's the last hit
Lil Wyte gon' be blasted
Til' I'm hittin' my casket
You a grown man, wrong thang
Tryna hog the dope mane?
You wanna fuck with me without passin'
Just stick to cocaine, bitch!

While you sitting there babysitting, conversating with the weed?
(Pass that shit, nigga pass that shit)
Man you fucking the rotation up, just pass the shit to me
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
Why you rest having the blunt when I put half up on them trees?
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
I see you one of them niggas that be tryna smoke for free
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)

I'm chillin' with my nigga ""Get High""
C-H-R-I, S, cause he always keep the best
And we in the woods
And we wish a motherfucka would
Come through, fuckin' off cause we on that good
Up all night, this cain's an upper, weed is a downer
Wit' them guns beside us, we starin' at them cameras
Steady smokin', watchin' porn on the flat-screen
With some bunnys from the platinum in my main ching

I'm on that weed and that Red-Bull and alcohol
That get you hype or slow you down, it's like a speed ball
But I can't stand when a nigga wanna roll it
Then (cough) and hold it
Hurry up and pass it before you get your ass kicked
I got a ounce of weed but you ain't reachin' in my plastic
It's sticky more than Taffy
It's finer than miss Halley, Berry
Call it blue-berry
I need some commisaries

While you sitting there babysitting, conversating with the weed?
(Pass that shit, nigga pass that shit)
Man you fucking the rotation up, just pass the shit to me
(Pass that shit nigga, pass that shit)
Why you rest having the blunt when I put half up on them trees?

I’m sui, homi, all them cidals
State your last name first
Meyers, Michael
Lord is killin', Three 6 killin'
What else will I say? Even children
Probably don't give a fuck if you are naughty or nice
At night, sacrifice, good bye, lights out

Can you feel me, can you hear me?
Did you pick the scene
A lot of fools done fucked around town
Showed up in your dreams
Standin' in a hideaway
Inferred, them guns spray
Gotcha shakin'
Gotcha nervous
Knowin' not how to get away
Lookin' out the window pane
Cause all your gonna feel is pain
In your yard I see a tree
I also see your body hang
See the phone, pick it up
The wire that is only cut
I meant to pray 
You're too late bitch
Your time is up

Be a victim of my homicide
If you try to jack

And creep up out my vehicle
And continue my jack move
Still gat under the dirt
Now put it up in your hand
Now ain't that smooth
Motherfucker
Snooze motherfucker
Move motherfucker
Loose motherfucker
Put your face down to the floor
And don't you take a look up
I heard about what you cook up
See bitch this is a stick up
I'm takin' you off your tippy toes
Take your cheese
And fuck your hoes
Givin' you crack sacks, macks back in your Cadillacs
Drop Glock in my draws
Extra clip up under my balls
My dick's like a 44
Fuckin' up your pussy wall
You ran your lip about your grip
And I'm takin' in on the stash box
Your pockets are swoll ho
And I'm lookin' for a jackpot
I wear a mask on my face
So I won't catch a case
Keepin' it low key
Don't nobody know me
I'm just like a snake
When I creep through your window
So motherfuck the cops
Cold hard on me kin though
So motherfuck the 5-0
It's all about survival
I leave them like d-o-a
Bitch that's dead on arrival

To avoid, can't you fuck with us
In the Lexus truck with Juicy J
Getting fucked up
Tearin' the club up
What be bumpin' on the radio
Mafia is what I'm screamin'
Till the day I die ho
More game for the lame
Educate them bitches man
Stay in focus

And have you hollerin' out mafia mafia mafia mafia

Stick em' dead

Rush them tricks on down to the flo'
With north Memphis convicts
Bithces call me Koopsta ho
Fuck me once never twice
Wrapped up on that game of dice
How can I lie
When at nine hundred times
You said you was a man of the house
I don't really done it
Koop you hung around that nigga man
Try so hard to be a soldier bitch
But come out to be dealt with trick
I'm sick in the head
Better call Fred

Knock Tha Black Off Yo Ass,Most Known Unknown,2005.0,"It ain't no bitch in my blood nigga its nothing but thug 
I'lll knock tha black off yo ass 
 
({North North} repeated throughout verse)
The main nigga on the block where it's hot talking shit
Gon' be the main motherfucker somewhere dead in a ditch
Bullet lead to his broke leg two off in his head
Was he scared then hit the man cause of what he said
Copastead I be copastatic means I'm to the good
Copper lead in my automatic when I'm in your 'hood
Wish you would try to flex dog pistol in my drawers
Hollywood North Memphis dog motherfuck the laws
Kept it real from the jump street still lookin' up to me
Out your grill bustin' wit' the heat off of the concrete
Blow your toes bloody out your nose got the body cold
Guy's will roll you to hospital full of hollow holes
Check 'em in with a sheisty grin you get out this cab
You gon' hand me some damn ends break yourself for dad
Doin' bad but I'm not for long my nigga it's on
When I shoot with this fuckin' tone you is gon' be gone

 
({North North} Repeated throughtout verse)
(Mm-hmm) 10 g's will get your ass blown off
Have your mama boohooin' and your daddy and your mother in law (mm-hmm)
20 g's will get your ass chopped up
Like some rendevue barbecue tips we don't give a fuck (mm-hmm)
30 g's will get you thrown in a river
Splittin' wit' your nigga he'd probably ride wit' us (mm-hmm)
50 g's will get you cold taken out
Niggas mention your name they say ""Man we don't know what you talkin' 'bout"" (mm-hmm)
You can get your ass pistolwhipped with a nine or a .45 or a henny fifth
We fight dirty till we die nigga get your throat slit
Then we stomp you to the ground and then we throw you off a cliff
We don't give a fuck


You can talk about this you can talk about that
But if I catch you talkin' I'mma beat you wit' a bat
Do you something wrong nigga how you like that
I thought I saw a puttycat I thought I saw a cat
Peepin' my goods try'na see my stash
But if I catch you peepin' nigga that's your ass
You the type of nigga that'll keep coming back
So I'mma gon' kill you leave you dead where you at

I think they better call Bush cause it's a national disaster
When I unleash my pistolgrip Bushmaster
Ring the alarm I got double drums
100 round spitta' you can't hide you can't run
I'm a sniper ridin' in a blue Chevy
A trunk full of guns man you hoes ain't ready
Kill a bitch like Freddy in the beddy in pajamas
In the middle of the night wake him up to red sights(Blaoow!)",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-knock-tha-black-off-yo-ass-lyrics

Some real shit man, let's drop it
Let's go!

You know I can't live my life, working no 9 to 5
No matter what they say, I'm doing it my own way
Cause time ain't on my side, and they don't understand
Forget what people say, I'm doing it my own way

So many shysters in my ears fool, trying to pop it
On my new fame, they will put new hands in my pocket
Standing in the rain buck in hand man, about to cock it
I take another one they wanna be up out the rocket
I can't understand why they even wanna see me broke
(whoahh-ohh)
Wanna see me choke off my own blood from cutting my throat
I always wanted the money; fame wasn't worth my while
That's why I wore a mask on the front of ""Mystic Stylez""
(doin it my own way)
But one night in March '06 my life changed in a sec
Whether for better or for worse I can't answer that yet
But I'll go to the pen before I lose my ends
Murder one, one of you hoes tryin to get me for my Benjamins


Real talk!
In the field, it's real, slip up, get killed
Get robbed, get stung, get messed off in a deal
These kids are gone, on meth, and pills
That's why, I pack, I carry, the steel
I'm posted, in the hood, got green, I'm good (whoahh-ohh)
Trap house, no doubt, is where, I stood
Got guap, got hot, 'til shop, got popped

The times ain't gon' change (change) long as cocaine ('caine)
Goes up the nose (nose) fries a nigga brain (brain)

We started kicking ass drunk off ass kicking potion
Cause we left him there even in slow motion
Im gone break a nigga jaw break the fucking law
Break him down raw break nigga all y'all
If a nigga violate you in the club
It ain't shit tp talk about clock his ass out

I never try to move fast I just stick to the script
If a nigga talking shit, hit that bitch in the lip

You niggas wanna doubt me
You mad cause I get the cash then a nigga out
You won half of the bar nigga fuckin' payment

On these boney knuckles and all
The things youll soon be regreting
I have a closed captioned marijuana treated brain
Meaning when you hit the ground
I'll spill it out across the screen
Round one and white ain't got no choice
To beat the compition
Let that mother fucker swing
And show that bitch what he been missing


I got a one hitta quitta for any nigga talking shit
You talk shit they find your body in the ditch
Ain't nothing going on but that triple six
And hypnotize fucking minds can you handle it
You in the club trying to show off in front of a bitch
I beat you down and throw the fuckin six
And go outside and get the extra clip
We make an example out of you nigga don't be next bitch

Beat Down,Underground Vol. 2: Club Memphis Underground,1999.0,"I got some brass knuckles for the bitch who try to fuck with me
Got a steel tote for the nigga who try to duck me
Walls stained with brains from the bitch that owe me
Say she got some static, slip and get that tag on the toe see
Ain't the type of motherfucker that get real filled with that anna
I'm the type of motherfucker that'll fill you full of that ammo
These suckers be claimin they servin, they sprayin, them bitches I blow out they candle
I handle the shit like that, Scarecrow ain't for no ho games
For the ones that didn't know, Scarecrow brain kinda strange
Aim my pistol strike you dead on the nostril
Bitch don't test the Scarecrow cuz the Scarecrow kinda hostile
Sock yo ass with a buckshot in yo wind pipe
What the fuck is a fair fight, Scarecrow tryin to take yo life
Stomp you in yo face til there's no light and no sound
Look at you now, just another punk beat down


I'm aiming for your face, so that's where the bullets will go
Niggas be talkin that shit on these tapes
But they don't do it in the streets
So I hang with my rap crew, named the Serial Killaz
And do, all my dirt with the Backyard my real niziggas
Cuz when somethin goes down the whole crew gotta clown
Shoot one you gotta shoot 'em all
And still you gotta leave town
Cuz the Killaz don't play, in the nina tre
Listen to the words I say
Bring it on nigga bring it on nigga this way
And watch that shit you be talkin on beat put to an entry
Bring yourself, your family, and your groupie friends that be
Talkin on yo tape and sayin you got some anamosity
But you can't tell cuz in the streets you never say nothin to me
We thicker than concrete that's why we be runnin clowns
Different hoods come together that'll beat all of you down
And Backyard niggas love to clown on tricks like you
That's why you get beat down


Cruisin' through the Downtown blocks, Red Bull in my lap
Paul staring, I'm loading the gats
I'm ready to spit some fuckin cap, now
I heard them bitch ass niggas been talkin all that shit again
Fuck all that mixtape dissin', fina put them bustas to their end
They don't know Scarecrow is on the real-zeal
Paul lets hit them faggot motherfuckers up Im ready
Lets stop at the store, let me get some beer and papers
Lets get tore up on this crop before we give these niggas the favor
I pass the brew to the back, then Napoleon grabs it
Him and Lil Buck in the back, they loadin automatics
Thinkin about they summer mix, gettin pissed off what they said
Damn now I really wanna cut them bitches heads
They dead, I see them bitches y'all, yo lets get 'em Paul
Pull down your mask and make sure you get 'em all
This ain't no bullshit, take you motherfuckers down
Duck ya head, watch yo back bitch, or ka-pow",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-beat-down-lyrics
3-6 in the Morning,Chapter 2: World Domination,1997.0,"6 in tha mornin' police kick in my door
Slipped on my lugz
Cuz these thugs out the back yo
Jumped the back gate
Cranked the Chevy
Then I race
Popped in the tape
A motherfuckin' Three 6 Mafia tape
I'm crunked off the bump
Pumpin' through my backseat
Speedin' hit the weed
Though the end of the streets of Memphis, Tennesee
Got my stacks and some bags sittin' in the stash spot
Tatooes on my legs and a hot 40 Glock
They got the hard on for the Infamous nigga
Call me Scarecrow
Used slangin' man, but I don't do that no more
I'm feelin' like I'm the most wanted
Every cop is an opponent
In the dash
On my ass, on the cherry buck flash
And I'm real
Man I got to get the fuck out of here
I had to ditch the Chevy
Callin' my mafia niggas to scooped me up
The blocks are crawlin' with cops
I can't go down, them slugs bust
I'm runnin' through yards and shit
Tryin' to dodge them tricks
I'm a movin' target
I spotted my nigga out there
On the real, gonna rde with out no fly shit
He didn't hesistate, we climbed up out my side of town
I told him bout' the drama in the ride and how it went down
I got a lay low cool (??) before I get back in it
Anti-peace and po-police
I beat them with Glocks back to the street
I can't get caught, cause the new law say in it ""ain't no deals""
I would decease these devil police, therefore I do twenty years
Every nigga and grill they drop a dime to papers
I gotta pull a quick capa before I catch the vapors
12 a-m the next day
Gotta bank the seas
Gotta preacher please (??) throw in the keys
Down to my nigga
Got the passport to get my overseas
Under the palm trees
But you know me a quarter key
But my pan was injured
The silent alarm was triggered
I heard a cop say come out with fuckin' hands up
Nigga now I got to show my Prophet (??)
My only way out was to take me some hostages
They keep askin' me over and over for demands
I told them back up
Or she got brains on her pants
The gun was to her head, I told them don't make me shoot
But little did I know they had a sniper on the roof",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-3-6-in-the-morning-lyrics

You a cropduster sprinklin seasonin'
We some flyin' saucers
Keep away from what'cha know
Twice as far from what'cha don't
Consequences come to those who chose to fuck with us, lil ho
All we do is make our music
Keep away from usin' units
Sometimes when they push my crazy button
And then I abuse it
All I publish is the truth

Fuck on us, and make a Choices 2
And end up dyin' foo

I got a pound from Paul and J
Just a call away

I'm tryin'a get that money, dogg

Got bottles, I brought a K

Have his cranium poppin' off like John Kennedy
Send your enemies to this devilish hunter
Startin' at the kindergarten Grab at yo toddler

How many niggas wanna go to war with us
How many niggas really think they can hang with us
How could you sleep on the thugs when the thugs dont sleep
Because we keep in the street
7 days a week, nigga

Let me tell you bout these monkey ass niggas, all up in my grill
Niggas clamin' they down on my side but they ain't on the real
Smilin' in my face, behind my back, they tryin' to get my raps
This ole wannabe nigga
I bet I slice you like a fuckin' snappa
Up in the streets
You lookin good
Its because of me
Keep it in mind without the sixth
You would never be
A nigga hit me for the 10-4
I hit a 10-4
On my walkie-talkie
Them niggas ask me what Im in fo
I said I need a nigga heart ta
Stop beatin'
We playin the same game
But these motha fuckas cheap brah
I treat this mother fuckin nigga fair
And In return what I get
The nigga try to cut my fuckin share
And to find out
He down wit cowards in the first
Think I'm talkin' bout you
We writin' a fuckin verse
Maybe I am nigga
Nigga maybe Im not
But if you think I am
You guilty
Feel the fuckin' buckshot

How many niggas wanna go to war with us
How many niggas really think they can hang with us
How could you sleep on the thugs when the thugs dont sleep
Because we keep in the street
7 days a week nigga

This shit we gettin' cause
We focus
We watch the dopest
We get ta smokin
Like molten
The niggas hopin
But cannot cope
With the locest
Eletric wit
60,000 volts
Its ferocious
To get trocious
So take notes
Its provokive
You think we jokin
Hocus-Pokus
You open
The foo was scopin
Catch a pump
If ya dont keep

Take that boy
All his stuff

How many niggas wanna go to war wit us
How many niggas really think they can hang wit us
How could you sleep on the thugs when the thugs dont sleep

Rule number 1, never steal from the Juice
Rule number 2, when you cross then your through
Rule number 3, I can't see you when its dark
Rule number 4, is that nigga ridin in the car
Rule if you think a nigga playin wit you hoe
Then stick it to the streets
Cause real niggas often roll
And if I got a knife
Then theres gonna be some fuckin killins
Like if they talkin hard
Leave em hangin from the ceiling
And if you ain't involved
Dont you get yourself involved
Cause hardest lookin niggas

Always pullin guns
Comin up in the game
I had to watch my back
Cause niggas want the rymes
They fuck my stack

I won a fuckin gold plat
And I still pack a strap

Cause I be lookin' mean
And if you stick a knife right through me
Cut through my bloodstream
You hoes ass niggas better kill me
Cuase fool this ain't no dream
I'm comin' for you like I'm crazy
Straight out the institution
Like a mafia member pay me
They know there nothin' to it
To leave my house lazy
And throw her in a sewer
The 97 you can't fade me
When I got something to do with it

Now we got some killas in the house
When you claim you couldn't tell
Do I need to leave it here?
(buck, buck, buck)
To leave your ass convinced
Or do we need to put some kick dose on you fucky hoes
Mack 10's and 12's rebel
WE got this under control
And when we call this type of deal
It's a splash party
When them brains paint the wall
It's Dj Paully all off of ya'll
Watch me blas
Watch me grasp for this stash
Rip off this mask
I done got hotter hope it's all cash
And the n we hopin' in this essense
But throw them gats
The mask and sacks of cash in Juicy's Lexus

Lord Infamous, I keep clouds of smoke flyin' out my mouth

Triple six, triple six, triple six
Smoked out
Now I'm high really high, mane, I'm about to shout

Now I'm sittin' at the crib with a blunt up in my fuckin' hand
Dreamin' of another funk, thinkin' of a master plan
Take the Tec up in my hand, squeeze it quickly as Fly can
Crazy as the Gangsta B. all Fly see is blood, man
Now I'm forced to sweat the track because I'm down to make some ends
But Fly prefer the easy route by makin' bustas check it in
Gimisum, gimisum, hand it here you selfish pig
If your ass wasn't so greedy then you still would breathe my nigga
Fly is headin' to the home, finished up my serve-on
Cause Lil Fly just made a stang, I take you to your stash John
Creepin' through the fuckin' dark, rollin' deep with South Park
Funked out, loced out, you know a Playa won't be barred
When I'm 'bout my hog kill I'm evil as Fly (?) grin
Lil Ibn down to make some ends, bitches gotta check it in
And for you jealous punk ass bitch all up on the Ibn nuts
Fuck them folks, fuck yo folks cause Lil Fly just don't give a fuck

Yeah South Park in this bitch
Lil Fly and Gangsta B. in the house for the '94, '95 hoe

Who's that busting up in my door, was way too slow, I hit the floor
They shot up all my niggas in the kitchen flippin' Dominos
Blood all on my leg, I wiped that shit up to my fucking head
Caught them trizzicks slipping, buck them busta bitches dead
Peace out to my niggas Tim and Killa, they're my roadies
My mama said there be days like this but my daddy never told me
And that's why I'm a hard lead, twisting on my dreads
I'm scared, a nigga dead, it's in my fuckin' head
Thinking I would hesitate and wait to buck you bitches down
Read up on my deeds nig, cause I ain't no damn hologram
But I'm clicking with that quickness, like a sickness from the Triple 6
Drop you within a splendour, cut you up like Jeffrey Dahmer bitch
Really I could care less 'bout a nigga tryin' to flex against
The mothafuckin' Tech, you get some *shots* up in your neck
And when see you the Koopsta Knicca, it's a fucking redruM
Run, run, run 'fore I leave ya damn body numb

Yeah it's Koopsta Knicca in this motherfucker

If you bitches ain't scared put a bitch right to the floor
Tell her she belong below under shoes where roaches go
Ho I'm ready if you ready tell me what you wanna do
To the lovely Gangsta Boo, buck as fuck I thought you knew
Put my sign up in ya face
Leave ya stape without a trace
You ain't buck cause bitch I saw ya stankin' ass yesterday
Tuck ya chain ho ya weave cause I'm comin' in the crowd boy
With niggas and I'm out slammin' bitches to the ground

I see ya from the stage ya angry face is fighting in the corner
Full of marijuana niggas in the middle in a trauma
While they throwin' 'bo's they snatchin' hoes that stuck in a coma
Any thick lil' fine bitch come on through a nigga all up on her
Some trick done got mad and ran to the wagon and grabbed a 12 gauge pump
Probably full of that numby numb that coke and rum and gettin' dumb
Cars are barrelin' through the nigga shootin' runnin' to the Rover
Niggas catchin' the heat from slugs
Negroes gettin' trampled over

Make them niggas fight, what make them hoes fight

Now I got you bitches hot
Platinum out and on the spot
Mad because they take your cell
So they stop at slangin' rocks
Bring yo ass to North Memphis
Killas hang and niggas pimpin'
Playas on them cards flippin'
Choppin dope up in the kitchen
And I always keep it real
Way before a record deal
So my nigga don't hate on me cause Juicy J be gettin his bills
Clean that mug from off ya face unless you want a casket case
Nigga fuck what ya end, who ya clean, and fuck ya friend

Nigga you claimin set, throwin', showin' signs
You ain't no one look inside your face is plain as day
Another ho is showin'
Bitch I'm down with the same game you claim but I will fuck you up
Ho it ain't the same off in them flames I don't give a fuck
Put some in your liver you so trill in the studio
Nigga all but the liver watch you run like bitch was stealers that I let you

Packing automatics full of that static that you stressin' for
Actin' like you want some but it seems you scared to go

Ain't no grins up on this man
It's the ? that keeps me cool
Social security breaking news
Shit could fight up all night with mo henny wait that's how I (breath)
Do you feel it? Is it rare?
Smack that bitch up with that chair
When you see me over there
Raise your hands up in the air
Cause bitch this ain't no Rosewood
Nigga take another round
Slipped up, chopped up, fucked, lights out

Claim where I claim, hang where I hang
Burn where I burn, nigga ain't no thing
Do what I do, hanging with my crew

Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em in a hoe spot
Take me to the stash pot

Well I'm fresh up outta jail with no job, so I steal and rob
Creeping through them parks
And running them bitches up out them boulevards
This that type of shit that'll make you click to get your ass in

Bitch them mothafuckin' dividends
I'm that nigga to envy with, that damn devil in me

Leaving they mothafuckin' pockets empty
That's what I did and now I got a fucking bloody Glock
From making these niggas lay drop yourself
I'm taking these bitches off to my stash pot
And when I step damn fool best to watch yourself
Cause walking with that Koopsta Knicca's bad
For your fucking health
Hoe I would rather make a stang than be a lame burglar
And if I do ya, it's a murder, murder, murder, murders
Inside the mind of a mothafuckin' lunatic
Leaving bitches headless it's pathetic to try to fuck with this
That's why I make these hits and call this shit a nigga knock
*Bang, bang, bang* Bitch don't let this be a stash pot

Tie 'em to my bumper, drug 'em, fuck 'em
I don't love 'em, dump 'em, slump 'em
Put 'em in a hoe spot
Take me to the stash pot

5-O's on my dick now tell me bitch what am I supposed to do
Some trick must have snitched
About that Koopsta Knicca robbing fools
I never break a sweat
In the presence of a mothafuckin' redneck
A high speed chase is in effect
Wrap a scarf around my dead dress
Stolen Chevy balling in with the 450 in this mothafuckin' bitch
Plus I'm laying down niggas
5-O bitches they can't fuck with this
Turned the corner
Thinking I'm gonna lay these tricks in a body bag
And could this be the end of the Koopsta Knicca in a ski mask
Ask me if I'm Dracula, I'll tell ya time I'm fucked up
Victims of my fucking stang
Got a trunk filled with the mega buck
He lies on my fucking side shaking paranoid and shit
So I just put an end to that *pop* scary bitch
Cockpiles at his side plus I'm ruthless by my damn self
Plus hanging with the Koopsta Knicca's bad
For your fucking health
Getting up outta my haul killa stealing, this is pimp shit
Really 'bout my business, trick, dropping niggas off in my stash pot

Mask on my face no description of who made this hit
Bitches thinkin' ""who was it?"", bitch it was triple six
Devil thoughts, evil thoughts, trizzick bitches I just clizzick
Plenty of blood, no suspects, only victims laying dead
Shells laying in their body's, it's the fucking bullet lead

Keep my business quiet as kept, mothers in that black dress
Headed back to my fuckin' hood, project born, ridge grove
Hustla' raised gangsta' raised business up in dirty coast
Now sorry you're the one got me reachin' for my hip
No friends in the game in the spot victim of my clip

You better take cover ho cause this shit is on like that
Squeezin' my fuckin' trigger blastin' to take yo' life
Your niggas done got all down so you have to pay the price
Jumped in the fuckin' ride loced up like from head to toe
I pulled out a sack of ink rolled up as we start to blow
My gat is tight in my hand it's too late to break and run
My bullets ejected bitch got shot down by teflons
On a spree, killin' see, welcome to the evil side
It's too late to run bitch, victim of a drive by

There is no tomorrow, armageddon is gettin' closer, and
Smoking on some green, thinking of a plan to rob a man
Scarecrow my nigga, do you think that I can do this shit?
Do you think I can get away so smooth after I hit this bitch?
It can be done so all for one and one for fucking all
Who got them nines? Who got them Tecs? Fuck alla y'all!

Psychedelical spirits they spiral inside a kaleidoscope
What would happen if I traveled back in time and replaced the Ten Commandments with something I wrote?
The world warfare ended some thousands of years ago, by the rapper Lord Infamous ""Scarecrow""
Happiness is not even a option my friend, it is something that you'll never know
Believe superstitions, swarm bees and zombies
Sea monsters and sorcery, witches, genies, three wishes

Further the regions of your mind
I explain the unexplainable myths and times

Triple 6 is my mindstate (killa, killa)
Pre-occupied with devil shit (murderer, murderer)
Trying to survive through this crime rate

Sittin' on a porch, firin' a torch to the light green
Weed, then proceed to my mission as I plot a scheme
Meanwhile the sun set, trees blowing spookiness
Twist the doorknob to my viper, inside was the mask and Tech
So I scooped Koop and Boo, load up the Tech two with me man
Keys to the ceilin' is what they got for me to come over and stang
Kick some doors, put some hoes on some mother fucking floors
Give me da motherfuckin' chingching, hoe before you go in smoke

Picture this, picture that - where your little kids at?
At the back of the alley, blast 'em with them Glocks and Tecs
Sad to see they killed the nigga was innocent, though he was guilty they figured
Not knowing that he was a mafia member, a mafia member found tossed in the river
Loosened his skull, dent in his mug
Blood scattered all over the place, no escape
For someone that saw they face
None of them got them a murder case
Laying in disguise, get the lies out they minds
As they fly high, wide in the skies
Open they eyes, then they realize
 4x
Triple 6 is my mindstate (killa, killa)
Pre-occupied with devil shit (murderer, murderer)
Trying to survive through this crime rate

Is it Friday the 13th, are you niggas scared?
As I cock my gun back, put a bullet through your head
I spit them dreads
Whatever, whatever, you better beware
The evilest scare
Leaves nothing but shells and gun smoke in the air
I got them Glocks
So if you run you'll hear them pop
And then you'll drop
I'll come up on ya and never stop
Till I reach that point
To wipe you out, you hoes and haters
Smoke you like joints
You should have prayed to God to save ya

It was on a Sunday night, a nigga hit Paul back
He said he had a job for us to do to meet him at the partys on the mall and democrat
My girl beeped me, she told me Paul was on his fucking way
Hit me on his cellular phone, he's balling down parkway

Need to take a seat when you takin all them pills
Passed out on the street your body rollin downhill
This dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed up
Dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed...
This dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed up
Dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed...

Yessir I grab me a gram up out the drawer, I break it break it down
Keep it in plastic I hit it hard, shake it shake it down
Grind it down fine, chop it up, make it powdery
Cut it into lines on the plate, with the razor-y
Razor-y, listen closely, must be done on smooth surfaces
No wood, you get the splinters in your noses
Get the straw, cut it short, slant it at the end
Two inches long, now you're good, go on dig in
If it's your first time you probably won't feel it
Don't worry about it cause it might take a minute
Before I leave I got some more advice to tell
Rub it on a ho clit, make her cum like hell YEAH~!

Ghetto Chick,Da Unbreakables,2003.0,"I love a ghetto ass chick, break down rings for me
If I would let her she would count up this cheese for me
It's going down like I knew it would
We gon' keep on makin money cause this honey is good

I need a down ass chick, thatll roll wit the clique
For the dope sale, bank robbin, cock it back and buck up on a bitch
Kidnap vamp, leave a busters body, in a ditch
Take the charge for you, always drinking liquor
Stayin lit, when we in the bed, baby girl can ride
Like a champ, give a playa head, lickin on my thang
Like a stamp, if I had that I wouldn't trade anything
For her she my main girl, main dog, thats my name, Paul

Now I can't say that I love her, but I got some love for her
She showed me, she was bout a haul before I really knowed her
I schooled her bout them Glocks, I schooled her bout them rocks
I told her how to hold a spot when I was off the block
She kept it hot, as soon as I stepped in the house she had my money spot
Plus a dro blunt rolled up with a syrup lollipop
The hood tried to holler everyday but it ain't nothin
She down with the King but I still love a ghetto ass chick


This one here for the old lady but not dissin this time
This for when you took the charge when I commited the crime
I was out there super high playin mister crash dummy
You put up all my money, didn't take nothing from me
Always found your boy a lawyer when I caught me a case
Paid all my fines and kept up with my court dates
And even though I gave you hell with all these other lil broads
You always came and made my bail when I broke the law
The only one thats reliable the one thats dependable
Keep you by my side these other fools is suspendable
I ain't forgot when I was out there hurt for some cash
You never mind takin your last, on out the stash
Always tried to give me the last up out your purse
Always tried to get my ass to go on and go to church
I couldn't pay you back even if I had to
Hard on these fools but I'll never be to hard on you

They start talking like girls and shit (And shit)

You can't touch me
Stand back

They got scared when these hard hittas came in

We got them thangs and we brought 'em all in
These niggas play dead when they hear we came in (Came in)

See I'm a hard hitta yes I am
And I dont really nigga give a damn
About you and how you fuckin rock shit

Quit tellin lies to the public

You probably be wit me on this track
But I ain't come here my nigga for no sorrow no wounds
But im'a stay bumpin till I bump by head on my tool
Fo' real!

Niggas wanna blame us cause they ain't famous
They wanna ride a new whip instead of catchin the matter bus
So why I gotta take the blame for lame ass niggas not havin things
Maybe you need to boost some clothes get yourself some pocket change
I know you like them fairy tales say you make the three six sell
So while my pockets still on swoll you reachin in the garbage pale
Playa I’m out the frame with it, name a price and I'll spend it
Get yourself a nine to five and try your luck on a lottery ticket

What's up nigga
Wanna be bad as the next nigga
True facts you ain't gettin shit but fuck nigga
Buck nigga catchin the cut when I rush nigga
Jump nigga thinkin you cool you chump nigga
Fuck that im'a get nine to get mine
If you hood dog off in the club I'm on shine
Pine in my mouth fuck up your cloud and get paid
Wit' the same place to call our own and get away
Whats the deal dog I be bout buckin and getting crunk
And really dog I could care less about stunts
In my trunk though where you gon' ride after the show
Ain't no punk goes so I suppose you'll get throwed by some elbows
Fuck it I'll fill his ass wit' holes on that funk blow throwin high low

Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off
(Drop it off, drop it off) bitch I got a sawed off

Late last night lying in the bed eyes red
Thinking should I get these hoes
Thinking should I cut their heads
Should a nigga plan a hit or grab my pistol grip
And take care my business cause they don't who they're fucking with
Call my nigga Project Pat cause I know he got my back
Fuck writing rhymes, this is real shit, not a track
Camouflage in the dark for them boys who act hard
The devil on my left side, the other side I'm seeing god
Why do niggas talk shit?
Niggas can't stick together
Seeing a nigga get killed will make a nigga feel better
So I just walk in a pace thinking of the case of motherfuckers
Who trait pistol to your fucking face
This ain't no game nigga, my finger's on the trigger
The time is running out, my conscience says I gotta get him
Is there a way that a nigga can escape from hell
I fuck him up with the Mossberg buck shells bitch

Walk up to your house, knock on your door
And blow your ass off

Walk up to your house, knock on your door

Trigg & Lauderdale, Lakeview G’s, and them Texas Court G’s
The riverside G.A.N.G.S.T.A
Niggas down with the Triple Six Mafia
Let's ride, smoked out, loced out with a fat .45 on the seat
About to make a sucka nigga eat the barrel when I stick it in his mouth
Give me cheese, say your ABC's
Kind of hard to do when my pistol's in your grill
Mouth full of gold teeth, smile for the kill
I'm telling you sucka ass niggas for the last time
Don't run your mouth
The Triple Six Mafia niggas will blow your ass off

Don’t Cha Get Mad,Most Known Unknown,2005.0,"You know we got to do one for all these niggas
Out here sideline hating, you know what I'm saying?
Don't get mad cause a nigga straight up
Out the paint shop or the car lot or what not
Feeling mean on the scene with a pocket full of green
You know what I'm saying? And any one of y'all hoes think
A nigga gonna give them something, I can't give you shit
But this dick in your motherfucking mouth and in your motherfucking hole
And you got to reach me something for that, ho'
Cause I ain't for free, bitch
Pay what you motherfucking weigh

I pull up clean in my black fucking truck
My rims still spinning so you know I'm cutting up
I'm riding down the street, bumping nothing but us
I spotted me a freak, she was about to catch a buzz
I asked her what's her name, baby, it could be love
But you know you boy don't fuck with nothing but sluts
The ones that make money and stack them bucks
A bank for that cap and a bank for that butt

Nigga, I'll tell your girl she can suck on this big ol' dick
And won't be fucked up 'bout it if she pay her rent to a pimp
And in the public's eyes she can be legit, be my bitch
Cause at the shake junt she got to work a trick, get the grip
And never no back talking cause I call her jack, backhand slap
She come up short with money, baby, then I snap with a strap
She gotta let these hoes know who the shit running this
And you just might have to throw some blows
Take a hit wit the fist

Them 20 inch vogues with the yellow stripes
A 'rillo rolled up with some of that light
The 360 turn on the fold down screens
Turn it all the way around and watch it from the front seat
The knock in the back, get the trunk on rattle
Them hoes flocking to my whip thick like cattle

Hey, you better put that money in my hand
I was born to be a mack, not your motherfucking man
You mad cause I hit your ho, me and her split your dough
Why you acting surprised, I know you heard this shit before?
Me and Quint, pushing 'Vettes, smoking 'dro, no stress
One tech, two Glocks, infra red, no vests
I clock dollars and pop collars for a living
I'm at Pressure World every time I hit Memphis

5 A-M in the mornin'
Nigga heard them tones pumpin' like a thousand-five cannons
Nigga gettin' it on
Peep out the window, I was solo flashin'in the streets
Caught by cops
I'm tell them bring some extra tape and plenty sheets
Right they ass chevy drove by bout' seventy shotguns
Loaded for your roller
Put em' straight to sleep
Hollow points hit my fuckin' window
Make you think your through
Like it's the forth of July
With them niggas spook
I wish the folks would hurry up
I cock my gun back with my thumb
Nigga rowdy rowdy like it's North Memphis, Vietnam
As I gotta check to take a look and then fired back
I realized I was out numbered
In a deadly trap

Three 6 Mafia, Prophet Posse, Killa Kaze with the shotties
Leave your chest cavity sloppy and the autopsy all snotty
And I can't help but notice all your pain
When the mobsters got that clappin', clappin', clappin'
On them thangs man
We hear the gunshots ricochet rang diggy dang
Got a shirt full of brains and it looks kind of insane
I, Scarecrow with mystical styles, niggas are getting buckwild
Look at security files
Bodies are stacked up in piles
You wanna fuck with me player?
First you must say a lil' prayer
Ask the nigga over there
Dead up in my Frigidaire
Niggas are all actin' (??)
Grow up actin' now fight
Infamous buckin' all night
Burn in the afterlife

Gunclaps, we hear the gunclaps
The rowdy gunclaps the bloody gunclaps

Slip, slide come and take a ride
To my fuckin' stash pot
Nigga you can't hide
It's a mug Crunchy got a tug
Stuff a nigga in my trunk
Told ya'll niggas what
Crunchy ain't no fuckin' whore
Get down on that floor
Bitch I want more (more)
Bitch now give me more
Give me chocolate chunk bitch, I bitch I kill you more
They pay, that pay that five
Now bitch I want some more
All I wanna feel
Is some motherfuckin' rain
Let it rain motherfucker, let it rain (gon' let it rain)
See you inside by the game that I spit
Never ever in your life
Can you ever get with this

Hey yo kemosabe
I got hoes smokin' weed up in the lobby
Cocaine fills my body, like gotti
Hotty
Where the keys to room 2-10
I got thugs with price tage bout' to get in
We heard it's goin' down, tricks about 2 mil
Feel, the fuckin' Prophet Posse get ya killed
Nigga, we got 40 cals' to your face
Na'ad mean
Three 6 leave no fuckin' trace
It takes more gunshots for these boys to save ya
Me and Crunchy chunk ya' over like white with a razor
Several automatics in a Blazer
Before we bump you off
Give me that plate and the lazer

Gunclaps, we hear the gunclaps
The rowdy gunclaps the bloody gunclaps",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-gunclaps-lyrics

N 2 Deep,Chapter 2: World Domination,1997.0,"Yeah, the Three Six Mafia in the house
Letting you know
You better watch the situations you get involved in
You might get involved with the wrong people
And get into a situation you might can't get out of
Dig a hole you can't climb out you know what i'm saying
Get in it too deep

I'm in it to deep to get out now
They always told me death was the only way out
I'm sittin' up all night
I can't never rest my head
How will my family take it if i ended up dead

There was a man who approached me every night
When i was resting fast asleep
He tried to get into my mind
And he promised me power beyond my wildest dreams
He said he could take me away from
The suffering, begging, and life of a teen
So i had to agree
There's one catch i must worship him throughout the centuries
But i really didn't know any better
I'm tired of the pain and the crew told me whether
He gave me things he promised to me
But i kinda believe i will suffer forever
I'm tired of this wrong but brother his powers are much too strong
Oh so bad i want to move on
But if i do my soul is gone
Liars, fornicators, all you murders, adulterers, and thieves
What you don't know
Is that you're walkin' in the same shoes with me

Nothing but a ??? worth seekin' is all i see
He sit close to me
He said she Victoria Secret
Fills up the air
Perfume smells so fucked up
Auick right here with a stare
Buck doggystyle then the chair
Turned her on her stomach as she
Moanin' from the motion
If you ready for this dick and (??)
Koop finna come a little bit closer
Rolled her on her chest before the sound went pop
Then i reached for my heart
Oh my god Koopsta just been robbed
I hope you feel me
I'm layin' naked
Lookin' at the ceilin'
And bloody me just hear more (?) from the koopstas


I'm in it to deep
To escape this kind of drama
Got crossers, playa hatas, and fakers, that equals problems
Today in this day and time
You can't read nobody's mind
These smiles turn to frowns
When they see a playa on the rise
On top of the world
Just a lookin' down and laughin' at'cha
I'll never be popular
Like that 2pac ""i ain't mad at'cha""
So baby beware
This game of life is like do or die
It's hell on this earth
The only thing that's missin' is the fire
Come on baby tell me is it something that your eyes can't see
Or are you just blind
To the fact that you in it too deep

Yeah, i know what'cha mean
I had to stand on my ground
To get on the scene
Just me and brother down in the stuggle
Gettin' our serve on to the friends
And after dark
Deep in the park
Them doped up fiends will start
To light the pipe all through the night
I used to wonder what god
Please help the poor come off of their feet
Cuz there was nothin' to eat
Didn't want to jack or rob
A brother had to maintain the streets
Off in the projects
Wasn't lathargic
Cause i was tryin' to get out
Who can you trust
I had to be tough
I never ran my mouth
My and my crew would constantly hit the brew
A natural high
How can you make it in this world
But to try of die

1991 was the year 901
Was the area code
3-8 double 1-6 was the zip
Code of all the rows of road
Now let my story be told
A young buck droppin' on in a school house
But not to learn off in the tenth grade
Tryin't o come up at last
Like a total outcast
Off all them songs i done made
Bumpin' my underground tapes
Up and down the hall
The dj paul wasn't no damn thang
But then my dogs
Tony and shista asked me to join a gang
That ain't me man
But hangin' around them fools
I had to get down and join a click, see
Cause i made so many enemies
From the clicks off in my city
Now if i told you what gang it was
Then to you i will seem more than down
But if i told you what gang i'm in
I can only do a show off in my own town
But it's all too the good
Much love to the thugs in my hood
And in my set much respect
I'm wit'cha for life
And as you could bet
We lights one up today",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-n-2-deep-lyrics

In the street, like the curb
Candy paint, twenty chrome
Chiefin' on green herb

I got this clout NOW!
Back in the day, I wasn't here NOW!
Since I been droppin' these verses
I'm out the head
Just like the babies wanna think I'll come home
I'm from the South bloaw
I got Hypnotize gear on my body, throw on the set
Real quick, y'all squeezin' them triggers we bout to pop (pop)
Any fly lil' mama's boy, who movin' up on the block
Think you the stuff, you think you rough, boy quit playin'
Gangsta Boo know where she stay

But you don't think it because there's plenty
Of dues to be paid, up in this industry
Wanna come in outta nowhere bitch
I kick you on the streets then run in yo ear
And yet you end up wid that set that you claim
To record lables your master start, playa
I can't play yo album mack
And everybody can't be on the same thing
And everybody can't be a known rapper
Know what I tell ya exactly

In the ghetto we got ghetto stars
Riding in a steamed up car
Lex, wid them tinted windows
Pushing down the Boulevard
In the mouth you see the grill
You face a playa cause he real
Not because he roll and smoke
Or cut some deals, for the bills
Plus I'm tryna stack some G's
Pushing weight like quarter kis
(Hey let me ride in that Lexus truck?)
Freak you betta hit your knees
Never will I save a broad
Gangsta playas comin' hard
Chickenheads get out my car
I'm leavin' frantic in the park
Chrous (2x)

Y'all hatas ain't no killas
Y'all hatas be hoes
Cause neither one is ridin' down blastin
Wid hugs and vogues
Them boys tryna play the hard role
They get a head hole
Them boys shoulda played the smart role
And kept they ass closed
Instead ah sayin', what they saw
What I did, and who I did it to
Who else is in on it?
Who else you told?
I'm yellow paging 'em too
I had it up to here
I'm killin' this bullshit
Y'all fingers on triggers
And all them niggas on bullshit

So you wanna be ah
Playa just like me ah
Ridin' on twenty-ah's
Choppin' up a key-ah
Project dodgin' l-izz-aws
Glock-ah in my dr-izz-aws
Optimal after mo never do we pissoz
Do you have a hizap?
To unload a trigga
Crushin' on ya paper

Handle that use that gat

My lyrics flowing with danger and without love for the streets
I have to pay attention to everything that I say
Cause this punk ass bitches and faggots take this shit the wrong way
So I'ma lay my cards out face up so you can see them
Leave your bottom dollar on you cause all you will be needing
Grip you Glock call your shots
Grip your nuts and call the cops
When it is ana I don't see that there is any reason to stop

You see I just got the pistol grip AR-15
And it is still shooting them fucking 2-2-3's
From 200 yards I still got my enemies
Hit your pineapple make a bitch nigga bleed
My marty griffin shooting 5 football fields

Rung your doorbell
Pop your ass through the door

That you talk on your mix tape

Balling out in ATL smoking weed
And sipping on that cognac
Ain't no bitch bitch I'ma have to tell you
Ain't no rapper no nigga in a gang or a group
Gonna stop this playa from getting my cheese
If I'm selling coke keys or chronic pounds of weed
What you know about standing in a courthouse
About to get judged by twelve white folks life sentence
What you know about niggas in the hood ain't change
If you turn your back your main nigga put it to your brain
What you know about dissing on a cd that's old
Cause I told you bitches I ain't going no more


If a bitch talk shit
She can suck a nigga dick
If a nigga wanna fight
He can bring the fucking shit
Nigga know who I'm with
Triple motherfucking six
You can think that I am playing but I ain't playing bitch
I can give it to you slow
I can give it to you quick
If you bitches want some more
Then come and get and get it bitch
Got a whole bunch of bullets
And I promise I will spit them
Niggas know C-B from the one-hitter quitter

Know some real
Know some fake
Got some love
Got some hate
Know some with it
Know some cowards
Some smoke weed
Some snort powder
Some ride Chevys
Some ride Lacs
Some sell pills
Some sell crack
Some they thieves

Throw 'em in the mosh pit!

Swing your motherfuckin fists and beat em in the mosh pit!

Its the Juice, up in the club
So raise your set high in the air and show me love
We drinkin' beer, we smokin' pure

We sippin' syrup, you might get hurt
We snatchin' bitches beatin' 'em down in the dirt
We dumpin' fur, we throwin' chairs
So if you scary get your ass up out of here

Now show them golds, and swing them bows
Take your shirt off and commence to whippin' hoes
We got that danger, built for a stranger
Your boys scared to fuck with us but I don't blame 'em

Roll with them punches motherfucker don't run
Swing back (swing back!), pop back (pop back!)
Clear the room motherfucker like click click (boom!)
(Hook 4X)

Here I come, an only son
I'm goin' straight out the ghetto to number one
I'm gettin' higher, I'm on fire!
So all you haters better get ready to retire
I'm on the scene, I keep it mean
I went from having no chedder to bling bling
I got some ice, I'm never nice
And I'm a killer so don't make me say it twice
Straight out of Memphis, can I get a witness?
And I be lookin for the chickens with the thickness
I'm here forever, any kind of weather
You say you don't take advice you fuckin' better

Not even a hero can save your fuckin' ass!

See the Lil Wyte, I'm from the bay
I do not play, you best of prayed

'Cuz if I see you I'm creepin' up from behind
You better hide, you on my side
You in my hood and I know I'm up in your mind
I'll break it down, just like a pound
Of some of the prettiest gally that you done found
I am the man, you are a lame
I'll fuck you up worst than the effect of a plane
This is the real, don't like the feel?
Then get back off in the kitchen where you can chill
I roll with killers, and drug dealers
And all the others I kick it with 'bout their scriller
Throw 'em in the mosh pit!

P.I.M.P.,Choices II: The Setup,2005.0,"Pimpin' is big business (Believe me)
You gotta work these broads like never before (I say)
Pimpin' is big business
You gotta work these broads like never before

I'm a P-I-M-P, that's what I fuckin' be 
I'm a P, I, M-P

I'm steppin' out in gators fool
Slippin' on my gator shoes
Pimpin in my blood motherfucker
'Bout some paper, cool
Sharper than a razor dude
Fuck what I made ya do
Hoe get on the grind, respect my mind
See ya later boo
Hoe get on the track or get smacked
Bring that money back
Get your ass jacked if ya slack
That's that pimpin' black

Well spray the pimp juice
Cologne, it's on, gotta smell good for my baby
Mean mug a 'tute, (???) the spinners drive her crazy
Get country to roll, let the wind blow through her hair, through blown out brains
From time to time I pulled over, fucked her in pourin' rain
So I'm a pimp wit' my own level of pimpology
I'll keep my one and all y'all average keep y'all twenty-three


See I'm a (??) but I got a little pimp in me dog
I got a hoe out there, she's gettin' grip for me y'all
And if I catch her slippin', that's a lip busted dog
I got a stable full of thoroughbred bitches my dog
And if you want one of them to come up outta their drawers
You gotta pay wit' your way cause they some baddy lil' broads

Mind manipulator, player from the Himalayas
That hoe better say a prayer if she do not quickly pay a
Nigga, mack, stallion, slayer
Oh why do you wish to pay a
Brother like you fruity flavor
Don't you dare disobey a
Mack, Lord's the debonair
All up in intensive care
Soon as I think she's okay I'll send her ass right back there


They call me Juicy Dynamite
Women say I'm out of sight
I'm something like a main event
A royal talk about some fight
And if you see me coughin', chokin'
Might be off that weed smoke
I'm in the Maybach on the street
Your girl was givin' me deepthroat
Just a wild player from the north off the block
Slangin' sizzurp by the oz. and that solid by the rock

You see I'm all about that cheese hoe and ain't a damn thing funny
Fuck some matrimony bitch I'm talkin' 'bout that macaroni
I got some workers from San Francisco to Maine
Back down to Memphis all the way over to Spain
Cause I work 'em like never before (Believe me)

Waitin' for you to make a move, waitin' for you to make a move
When I get my hands on you ain't no tellin' what I'll do
Trail yo kids from home to school
Chopped up bodies in the tube
Burnin' in the back yard
Use the blood to fill my pool
Fill it up with nothin' left
Tape record the face of death
Evil forces in my mind tellin' me to kill myself

I shall fulfill your every desire
Tied up to my bed made off hot barbed wire
Demons dance to the chants of the ritual
Black magic wicked Voodoo
Turn the furnace high run inside

On Some Chrome,Last 2 Walk,2007.0,"I got a pocket full of stones...

Goin' down
Hypnotize Minds!
Three 6 Mafia
Featurin' UGK
Rest in peace Pimp C!
Hold up

I got a whip that's on that chrome (Gettin' paid, motherfucker!)
Candy drip off that chrome (On them thangs, motherfucker!)
22 inches on that chrome (Grippin' grain, motherfucker!)
They won't leave us alone (Cocaine, motherfucker!)
I got a whip that's on that chrome (Gettin' paid, motherfucker!)
Candy drip off that chrome (On them thangs, motherfucker!)
22 inches on that chrome (Grippin' grain, motherfucker!)
They won't leave us alone (Cocaine, motherfucker!)

Now let the pain begin
I'm born and bred off in the city of sin
The dirty dime, know that
Memphis Tenn
Where my dudes get throwed
Stuff that white up they nose
Take that kush, break it down
Sprinkle it, then reload
Where my homies ride high with a bump in the back
Sometimes might ride with a body in the back
Man, we clique in the club, our side ain't jokin'
In the parking lot, I tote and we're smokin'
Then we smash out, dawg, barkin' under the bumper
Ten cars deep got it sounding like some thunder
Riding 28's with UGK in the back
And the smoke still blowin' out the barrel of the gat

I got a whip that's on that chrome (Gettin' paid, motherfucker!)
Candy drip off that chrome (On them thangs, motherfucker!)
22 inches on that chrome (Grippin' grain, motherfucker!)

22 inches on that chrome (Grippin' grain, motherfucker!)
They won't leave us alone (Cocaine, motherfucker!)

First day I got out the slave plantation
My niggas and my bitches gave me a donation
Next day bought a spur, sliver not black
Chamillionaire gave me his candy-red Lac
And all I can remember, I was draped in stones
Everyday I drive a Bentley, I put it on that chrome

Bun Beata, hopin' out the slab with hundred-karat jewelry
Ready to protect it, baby, strapped up with my toolery
Boys like to play but I ain't with that tomfoolery
I lay 'em down quick, this is just the old school in me
They don't wanna see a nigga go, I might not come back
When I beat 'em down like a Paul and Juicy drum track

I got a whip that's on that chrome (Gettin' paid, motherfucker!)
Candy drip off that chrome (On them thangs, motherfucker!)
22 inches on that chrome (Grippin' grain, motherfucker!)
They won't leave us alone (Cocaine, motherfucker!)

They won't leave us alone (Cocaine, motherfucker!)

Its the first of the month, I wanna stunt, so playa, I'ma kick it
Straight to the car lot, this Cadillac I gotta flip it
And I ain't playin' around with these streets, I just unzip and hit it
And I ain't payin' for all of the weed, nigga, we gotta split it
You on a hood ride, then you ridin' with a bump
I got them suicide doors, 26's on the front
And that Patron and that Goose, man, I drink it from the hip
Cause I'm always at the bar, that's where all my money spent
I'm the trap man, trap man
Lookin' for a girl with fine cat, man, cat, man
I'm ballin' in the club, you know I'm rollin' I'm rollin'
I feel like Santa Claus, I bring the hoes in, the hoes in, the hoes in, the hoes in!

Like a Pimp,"We Never Sleep, Volume 2",2001,"Chorus 1 (2x)
Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes
Like a pimp
Keep the money not folded in a roll
Like a pimp
When I see you bitch you better have my dough
Like a pimp
Reach Back
Like a pimp
Slap the Hoe

Now I ain't Don Juan with the magic wand wand
But I can break a bitch for the cheese and the funds
I don't have to use a gun or even make the hoe cum
If a nigga go to jail then a bitch make bond
While you shakin that ass in the shake john john
I be sittin in the back rollin big blunt blunts
Let me know when you off to collect my money
If a nigga can't get it then a nigga will hunt
Cause playas like me don't see nothing funny
Bitch better have my motherfucking money
Black eyes and bruisin up a face I den done it
To let her know these bonified pimps who run it
She make a G a night but she told me 200
But that's what I get fuckin wit a snow bunny
I told her like this ask that nigga you be callin
Police found a body that very next morning

Smoking on the dro Young 
R-uin
Pimpin for my paper and I'm looking for the chewin'
Bitch I got to do what the fuck I got to do
Sippin' pop pills smoke good and 
bank spru'
Stupid pussy niggas acting all brand new
When they get some money that's what fuck boys do
I ride in the 
side
 get high in the South
Grip on the 
granny
 get plenty good 
miles
From them 
deep
 suckin' hoes with a mouth full of gold
She playin with her nose but she suck a mean hose
I can't even lie like a ghetto ass bitch
Is down for her daddy ain't scared to break a trick
A yellow ass, switchin' fast, 
suckin' while a pristic as

In the six, breakin' bricks, ballin' in the fucking mix
Pimp C, bitch you can't act like you don't know
Get down on your knees like a top notch hoe…hoe…hoe…hoe
Chorus (2x)

I like to kiss that weak gal moving tongue with the head
Kind that have a young nigga sprung out in the bed
Kind that make a motherfucker toes curl to his legs
And that tell any motherfucker just what she did
Play-a, can you dig, as she'll stroke the esophagus
She can beat the stick or big ass hippopotamus
Ain't no fuss plus her mouth open and dicks in
Project Pat came to get the cat and I'm in the benz

See I'm a pimp playa, hoes, lay her money make a bitch break her
First take her find me a good worker like a navigator
Drop the slut on a corner with nothing but baby wipes
Keep that pussy clean and Imma see you later on tonight
First I went and got the hoe, then I started to work the hoe
Off the whammi got a grammy just the way she brought me though
Then she went and bought some more
All I want a block a yo
Keep your boy dro, blood, and some drank waitin' at the door

Reach Back...(5x)

Slap the hoe
Reach Back...(5x)

Just throw that trick in the ditch
Ain't know way La Chat gon' let'cha slide

To show you folks one-by-one
A sheisty bitch, without no punch
Just got no love in my heart
It ain't no boy that I can't handle
Keep that tone in my trunk
This ain't no threat, I speak the truth
Gotta come too thick to get me
I'm warnin' you hoes before you come
That that ain't gon' be easy
(Verse 7, Koopsta Knicca)
Man a bitch'll take that loot
Without a pussy for them papers

Thinkin' to myself, man is it a bitch?
A cop or, it's them robbers
Pardon Mr. Mac, off in the scheme
I'm stangin' for my dividends
And pay a livin', ain't makin no brother
My cheese gon' reach the ceiling-fan
You can catch me in that burgandy thang
On grizzle when you see me
You can joke me and provoke me
Best believe the bleedin' is ig'nant
Fuck the reason and the treason
When time to get dirty, nigga bet our prophet
You was gaspin' for yo last breath
All I heard was Killa Klan Kaze

Blast 'em like some ralo bate's
For y'all mayates
Equipped wit' double clips and duct-tape
And wicked wiz-ays
And I prefer it keep me busy in my free-time
Caught 'em in the curry, and I'm knowin' they wanna re-wind
Give you second thoughts about that business you didn't finish, right?
Took you to the vault, cash it in, all-night flight

Koops not concerned
I let you burn and burn and burn
Everything in the prophecy has been demonically read
So I learned
Deep in the morgue
Lie corps in the quateras
They wanna face in a line of order
Can you place this shit
When you crawled up on the red man
You bounce set up in this bitch
Sittin' man and thinkin'
Though my dreams I hear little kids screamin
Poor preachers I waited for hangin'
Which got me like bored in the psycho ward like daily
The 6-6-6 mystery man
Is takin' me straight to insanity
Could it be a dimension of witches that bring out voices
That issue more tragedies
The seas of cries
Will soon be turning
Your fuckin' life over
Left the priest and island bleeding of four leaf clover
Then I crinkle enough of these slugs

I'm the nigga that was out at midnight to drop off a block
In a tinted out Maxima, they low-key and quick
Snowin out the do' with a Glock and a trunk full of bricks
I make the track boom boom without even touchin' it
As for my Blackhaven zoners, I’m just supplying it
I went to Key West and picked it up, back in Memphis broke it up
Call my nigga in, get our Crist', then we split it up

His pockets swellin cause e'rything he's sellin

The chopper's on the seat to cut you up like relish
The hood ain't changed, got these niggas still tellin
To lock this nigga up a two-time felon
This boy ain't bullshittin he'll kick in doors and kill 'em
And hide them bodies good that you can't even smell 'em
He niggarish and ignorant so fuck who in your crib
This gangster life he livin it so fuck your wife and kids
These janky niggas on the town I hope they know the biz
To all you federal tattletales, swap out where you live


You know the worst part about sellin dope is 80% of black people in jail
Because of drugs, domestic violence and murder

I've come to shake my ass

I've come to shake my ass
I've come to shake (Hypnotize Mind) ass
I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb
Yeah, a bomb in the club
Fresh off of the crash
Freshen up tail like an old mouse trap
Tell me what it is, how the 88 sound
I'm gonna take you to my crib for a lil' night cap
But then the slap, ghetto clown
Tap, tap, tap to the pretty little gal
Pump and burn to Knicca
Pump and burn to Knicca
Take a little break to hit me, hit me back
Go unless you make it now
Body moving like, there she go
Make me snap, already get me hard
Like high school jock straps
Let's recap
There's nobody 'ro those cute little shorts
If there's that love
If you ain't no tither, you better get drugged
Party shots, like wat, wat?
I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb
Once again in the booty club
Trying to get some love
I'mma do what I gotta do, I'mma be a bum
Wanna touch, even wanna cut
Down there like a butt
Black and white, mixed like a mutt
I'mma frustrate
I'mma pimp walking with a limp
Got a twelve inch in my pants
I've got her in a clip held by a chimp
I'm the man when it come to this
So an artist made her hips, it'd make her flip
I prefer a lift of my chopsticks
Oh stop it
Let the dancer take money outta your pocket
She can move it and drop it
With her clothes on, it makes her topless
She a hot girl in her own world
On the spot, girl
Body tease, body all grease like a 
S curl
My dizzies get my face made kinda sleazy
Pop it, shake that thang girl, please me
I've come to shake my ass
Need anythin', I'm gonna give it real
Just wanna shake my ass
Mean when I drink cuz I'm onto you
So can I shake my ass?
Meanwhile I shakin' make 'em sing, sing
With the bang, with the bomb, with the bomb
I'm a real role figure, lemme tell you what I think
I like women and I like steaks
I like cars with the candy paint
And an iced out booty with an iced out make
I like girls with their goodie-good-good
Woodpeckers peckin' on the woodie-wood-wood
She love a go on the hoodie-hood-hood
Takin' the whole thing like I knew she could
Pimp who?
Baby, you sexy, scratch my back
Bite my lips, just like that
Baby, you sexy, scratch my back
Bite my lips, just like that

I'mma creep up on this fool, put this gun to his head
Tell him give me all your jewelry, all your dope, all your bread
All the coke that you brought in, the weed that you brought in
And if I can't get answers, say hello, to my lil' friend
You fakin like you ball and brawl and shotcall
I'm that fool that break jaws and all the state laws
Stupid rappers get your check, buy rims and what's next?
Need to get a place to live, a crib, cause you ain't shit
With your mix-tapes, niggas hate, say they real, but they ain't
Catch them somewhere face to face, then they run from place to place

Since I made me some money (You believe it)
It wasn't no problem when I gave it to you (I know)
But since I quit I'm in the wrong to you (Thats low)
It ain't my fault that I kept chasin my dreams
You claimed you couldn't see the woods, because of too many trees (You dummy)
And dispite impossibilities (You know)
I turned it all to possibilities (For sho')
But that ain't keepin it real in yo mind (I see)

We pay cash for our cars then we pushed off the lot
Back in the say they use to say this rappin shit was a flop
But we done made our meal tickets now they jealous and hot

These niggas wanna be in my shoes, but they feet too small
They only yell so I turn to, just to see me fall

If you cain't beat him, just call the police on him
Or hate on him so bad try to turn the world against him
Go in the studio like a ho make some bullshit and diss him
But none of that surprise me I done been through it all
17 years in the game, real game, DJ Paul
I done seen the real, I done seen the fake
I done seen fake bitches turn real to fake
Cause hateism is a disease, it's kinda like AIDS
They feed you shit for years, and then they send you to your grave


First I'm broke, so I hang out with the rat and roach
And still broke, cause I'm sleepin on apartment flo's
The hood struggle is to get it, got to make the change
See every dark is like the dark cloud full of rain
You wonder why niggas high and they robbin folks
Ain't nuttin to tell you but to pack yo' heat and let it go
Them junkies get a fuckin kick, when they smoke a brick
I never seen a drug dealer ever call it quits

Frasyer Boy love to smoke, don't like it bitch? sue me!
Nigga I've been smokin' that ohhhhweeee!
(Backround repeat ohhhhweeee through verse 3)
(Verse 3, Juicy J)
I was down in California smokin' on some chronic
Man this shit is killa, had me spendin' all my money
I wanted to get in the playboy mansion, probably meet a bunny
And get some fire ass dro 'n release some semen in her stomach
We smoked up all the green all weekend, til' today is sunday
It had me dancin' 'round the room just like my nigga Crunchy
(Hook)
(Verse 4, DJ Paul)
Now I'm a weed smoker, mang fuck what'chu talkin' 'bout!
A dro choker, boy put this in yo' fuckin' mouth!
We rolled the Rovers mang all the way to L.A
'Cuz L.A. got some of the best in the U.S.A
Me, bein' a king, I can't smoke it if it ain't light green
Or a matter of fact I can't even be on the fuckin' scene

War Wit Us,"We Never Sleep, Volume 2",2001.0,"Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us
Do ya'll niggas want to get your head bust
I see them yorks in the sky raise em high raise em high
I see them tones in the sky raise em high raise em high

Yeah every time I flip the script
Niggas always talkin' shit
Mad because the cards I flip
Maybe he be struckin' wit
I think he used to slang them rocks
Set up shop on this here block
Orange Blossom apartment three
Niggas ain't even know me
Young and buck just full of beer
Drinking out my nigga Clair
Death is like we never fear
Even if we know it's near
Stealing cars and rollin dice
Trying to dodge the Memphis vice
I'm telling all you young niggas
In this game there ain't no life
Mom told me to stay in school
All I did was break the rules
Pop was preaching the word of God
I was busy actin' a fool
Mad with a fuckin' mug
Loadin' up my .38 slug
Head spinnin' from the killing
And through my blood ain't nothin' but drugs

Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us
Do ya'll niggas want a war wit us
In gats we trust
In heads we bust
See niggas like us
Uh uh we can't be trust
We come to your crib
I mean we come to your house
We knock on your door
We put the gun in your mouth
We throw our sets
No disrespect
All we want is money nigga
Can you niggas get met
No game I play
Wit none of you hoes
Like the one in the chamber
Puttin' bodies in holes

Now when they finally gonna learn about the Hav it's on
When these hip crisp niggas kick a hole in your door

No full clips ho I'n leavein' them off in your chest

Intro (Last 2 Walk),Last 2 Walk,2008.0,"Straight out the streets of Memphis, Tennessee
The robbery capital of the U.S
The Three 6 Mafia
Because of they Mystic Stylez
They Lived By They Rep 'til the end
Causing World Domination
And When the Smoke Cleared, they still was +Unbreakable+
Being the Most Known Unknowns
But after winning the Oscar only some would last due to pressure
And be the last man standing
DJ Paul and Juicy J, the Last 2 Walk

Smoke it up - what you do, what you do
Drank it up - what you do, what you do
Snort it up - what you do, what you do
Pop it up - what you do, what you do

I can hear the cries
Wishing they could turn back the hands of ti-i-i-i-i-i-i-i

Hahahaha! Aww man, get the fuck outta here
Your CD ain't messed up man
I had to fuck wit'cha a little bit
Cause I'm gone and I'm lit
But we finna give you some bump!""

What u bitches wanna do ('cause It's whateva wit us)
It's whateva wit us, it's whateva wit us
Verse 1 DJ Paul
Now how the hell you little nigglets
Try and test me
Knowing the whole time you grew up on the green
Y'all trying to be Paul
But I ain't tryin' to be y'all
Your pockets is empty
Like summertime school halls
I'm worldwide trick
You're on the radio in one goddamn city
So check your crooked lip bitch
And change yo plans
It's the numbers on your phone
And numbers on your cell
Verse 2 Juicy J
I ain't messed up by messin crooked cowards
Wit a nigga name testing my gangsta
Get his f**kin feelings hurt
Eyes 45 on the fish desert green
Sippin hen smokin and coughin on the scene
You say you wanna fight I know you is a joke
So step in the ride
They call me the Juice
And it's the truth
It's wit all the sports
So watch bitch
Chorus
Verse 3 Sean Paul
Yeah I'm straight for ATL
Screamin' f**k what you claiming
Actin wit the brand new mack
Brand new glasses all my niggas ???
I'm a gambler I'll handle ya
Hold the dice and shake em
Roll them self leanin the left
Nigga f**k around and break em
You' ze a bitch nigga I can tell it in your eyes
You a hoe nigga in tight jeans shown off your thighs
I'm a g nigga nothing but dro' rolled up in my swisha
In a big Lac with leather seats a pistol ready to split ya
I' m ready wit my partner ready to jump up in the chevy
I'm ready to kick it wit Three 6 Mafia
Back up 'cause we won't f**kin stop
Verse 4 J-Bo
You can call it how you like
But I'ma tell it like I see it
We strapped up wit heaters and bones
They so conceited
Dribble and bounce pass niggas they so grab
But the whole world will know when we blast it
Knock em off in the ghetto ready nigga let's go
Youngbloodz wit Three 6 swolled my whistle
I'm backdoor like lil joe now nigga let's go
It's pimpin in this bitch
Sawin hoes off like nitro
Chorus
Verse 5 D-Rock
Nigga you bleed like I bleed
We born to die

I hear you talking but actions speak louder then words
Nigga f**k what you heard I ain't never scured
Can you walk it like you talk it
Show a nigga you real
But shit like that get niggas killed
Either you won't but nigga you will
All these stories you makin up killin my ill
And my patience ain't long at all
Nigga don't f**k wit me if I ain't f**kin wit y'all
'cause I'm ready for the world but is it ready for me
What you see on TV is on these streets
Some of these niggas ain't as hard as they say they is
And niggas don't live like they sayin they is
They wanna roll wit thug niggas and gangstaz
But real ass niggas don't roll wit wankstaz

Survival is a everyday task
Watchin ya back for the man wearin a mask (In the ghetto)

If you in the hood lookin like ya came up (In the ghetto)

High off the ground, right beside a playa hip (In the ghetto)

First I'm broke
So I hang out with a rat and roach

Hella niggas want me murdered, but can't do the job right

Killin for a hobby like a medeival barbarian
Khen will the disaster stop?Never, nigga pass the Glock
Illustrated killin live in color like its magnavox
Now I got em hot, from the plot to put the block on lock
Set up shop wit over 50, 000 dollars worth of rocks
Ammunition cocked, prepared to pop, Ill even shoot at cops
Stash away the heat and then retreat off in my drop top
Find yo own bizness, or the gat'll make yo clock stop
187 from the west and get yo fuckin block mopped
You gone have to tangle wit a Hypnotize, get suprised
Good for makin money off the shit to stay the fuck alive

Come flip a bird wit me
Step on the curb wit me
Come slang n serve wit me

I only fuck wit real niggas, all the haters can burn in hell
If you ain't affiliated, dont come wit packs to sell
Object of this hustlin is bubbling stacks of mail
Situations turn sour, rivals'll blast then bail
When I hit the block I'm seein J's, drivin insane
Crunker than Montana wit some anna for ounces of caine

Sippin golden grain, makin stangs, inflictin the pain
Smokin, gettin into it, livin ruthless, the feds are clueless
We the ones who keep the city crunker than engine fluid
Hypnotize niggas ridin vettes, sippin moets
Strapped up wit a vest and giant tecs to lower the stress
51 niggas got my back, so nevertheless
Ima get this anna off my chest and smoke on this cest
Puttin bitches on the track, when its a pimp in the flesh
Solid as a rock for advesaries who wishin to test
Repeat Chorus
(Verse 3)
My scandalous recipe make niggas be scared of me
If there has been treachery dont try to get next to me
Yo life is in jeopardy when fuckin wit family
We turn to psychotic crews and all of our insanity
Break bread off of greenery, releasin the steam in me
Keep me from the weapons, Ill be fuckin up the scenery
Deport bullets like immigrants, bitch niggas dont attempt to flinch
Money is the motive, let my sinning end the innocence
Ima let the missile rip, ballistic wit hollow tips
You won't see me comin, keep yo fingers on the pistol grip
Smoke blindin my enemies, give em fearful tendencies
You can kiss they life goodbye when T-Rock hit the hennesey

The Kila Klan Kaze gon' watch you bleed
Ask Jesus for forgivin'
For all the sins that I did
I'm trapped in a storm
In a place we call Earth
I tried to stop but I just slid
Into a path where hatas are dwellin' my life
Lie in the hands of others
It's so fucked up in this place we call home
Cause it's the back stabbin' bustas
I separate my folks from friends
Is the type of click that I be in
It makes it difficult for me to decifer
Who came to ride to the end
See Ana it's all
Be every be wonderin'
If I'm gonna see tommorrow
So I pack my heat
Off in these streets
Bitch to relieve all this drama
I'm settin' my stake high
To a g to make g's
Cause I'm known to be the mackBut soon as I take two steps to the
Future
It seems I get pulled three steps back
You see less fortune in niggas
Start lookin' suspicious neglected
See we were cool

Jack one, smack one, run off wit ya sack son
Anybody wit the loot, give it up or I'ma shoot

Snort on some good dope, smoke on some good green
Friday payday, so I'm at the Shake Junt
Lookin' fo' a big lick, fiendin' for a fat blunt
Saw my victim caught me one slippin'
On the side of the club takin' a pissin'
No mask on face I didn't really need it
He can be damn fool and he'll get heated
Point blank, snatch bank, runnin' like a track star
Heart pumpin' fast like I ate out the crack jar
No one saw me made clean getaway
That means that I still live to get paid

I thought you knew I was the mane (mane) D-boy off the chain (chain)
Gon walk up to a girl tell a bitch I'm Rick James (James)
Wit the diamonds in my rang (rang) and gold point fangs (fangs)
And you know I'm hood rich means I got a lil change (change)
Wit my thugs from the North cause I know they got my back
Lookin for some chickens that can work it on the track

Posted up in the club wit a pocket full of crack

Let a nigga get a lil' piece of that pie
You ain't all that but you actin' stuck up
Let me pour some of this drink in ya cup
And maybe lata' on I get them guts
And maybe if not you be catchin' a bus
Pussy ass nigga keep blowin' up ya phone
Can't get the picture won't leave you alone

Girl what ya done did, that fool head gone
A freaky young playa' need to hook on you
'cause ain't no tellin' what you might do
Chew a nigga up in the Bentley coupe
Toes curled up like the ramen noodles

She get it so wet, she make it so warm
And on a lame brain man she got a lot of charm
She swallowin like a pill, and makin' them pay them bills
For a another nigga kids cell phone, car and grill
He payin' for the dinner for him her and all her friends
And when he spend the night her dog in the bed he in the den
But still he say he love her
Wouldn't put his mom above her
He did all this after the first time he ever fucked her

Look, Don't ask nigga you nasty nigga
You had ya tongue in my ass nigga
And you a pro so I know it wadn't the first time and it won't be the last nigga
Ain't tryin' to act like it wasn't all that
When you was sick when I call back
Name any piece of furniture in yo crib an' I can guarantee that we fucked on that
See when you hooked you know that
Its so that you gotta go back
And it seemed like any other chick that you tried to stick the dick in be so whack
It was some reason it won't stay up
But when you wit' me it be way up
And you'll never say no when I call your phone you'll already be ready to lay-up

He's a lame ass nigga hollerin' that he pimpin' a broad
But found out he was spending M on a broad
Oooh how a nigga be wit' that flawed
Handcuffin' hoe that'll do that job
Slop on my knob man get that chain
Ain't no shame in our god damn game

Erupt like muggin my type busta
Come get up in the middle of an inner city riddle
Wanna fill a figure up, and not just a little
Feel my force, of course you're hoarse
From the rusty point of Scarecrow's sickle
Stabbin up through the ?vouches?

Seem to me you never learn
So we have to demonstrate
Motherfuck a murder case
Shot the bitch off in his face
Face it hoe and be a man
Play the game until the end
You was out there claimin' killa
So to hell, with your friends
All your foes, I suppose
You think I'ma let you live
No love words never show
So not love is what I give
Get respect off in these streets
Stayin' real, packin' heat

Always out tryin' to creep

With them techs, Let em' kill

A buster gon' lose his fuckin' life up in the gizame

And blow your brizain's to pieces
And even if it's your time to clock those Glocks down

When The Smoke Clears
Sippin' On Some Syrup
Sippin' on some siz-erp, sip, sippin' on some, sip
I'm trill working the wheel, a pimp not a simp
Keep the dope fiends higher than the Goodyear Blimp
We eat so many shrimp, I got iodine poisoning
Fuck niggas make me sick with all that pinchin' and bargaining
You say that you a boss, I ain't believing that shit
You got the funny Geneva watch, with the Ferrari kit
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
I got the wet promenthazine, thick orange and yellow tuss
Hydrocor-zone, on the hands-free phone
The '84 zone, on them blades, 20-inch chrome
If you got 16, you can get a biz-zerd
I'm choking on that doja sweet and sipping on that sizz-erp
Niggas scared to flaunt it, some niggas they want it want it
Some niggas they joan it joan it, but I be fucked up up on it
We're with the Mafia 6, and we ain't bout that bullshit
If we gon' get high we gon' get high, and we gon' house a bitch
Two niggas all at the mouth, two niggas all at the ass
And plus there's some type of nigga
Dick hard all night and she cool with that
She popped her a pill of X, and drank on some orange juice
And just when you thought she was freakin' she done got super loose
Niggas come in by threes and deuces all in circles like duck-duck-goose
All that want it can bone it, she on that X and that tootie fruit
40 dollars for just one ounce ounce plus
Tuss and X is how its pronounced
Niggas sipping and dipping and tripping, man I'm bout all out
Sippin' on some siz-erp, sip, sippin' on some, sip
People always asking me, ""Me the Three 6 high on that""
Rolling on them X pills, stuttering pup-pup powder packs
Woah-wuh where the weed at, ain't like that we need that
Nyquil will slow me down, something that keep me easy
Nothing like that yella yella that will have you itching man
Talking like you ""What's up, fool?"" Vocal chords sounding lame
In my days all we did was chief out on a quarter pound
Gone on coke, eyes are bucked, this here shit will knock you down
Knock you out, make you fall asleep when you're on them wheels
Ain't no doubt, hit me when I beep for this refill
Once again, on my wicked high, gotta have that drank
Heard my name, Gino, I feel like I'm gonna fucking faint
Nigga tell me what you know bout Frank, Nito and Young Guido
Paul and Vito, we play a tune it sweeter than Pedito
With my Three 6 nigga pouring up in my southern creedo
Quick fast, we'll put it on your ass like John Vito
Cause you fronting rap sanger, be creamy like a Zanger
You ain't from the manger boy, but you gets the middle finger
Come bang her, rum dranker, occaisionally take
Your bitch to the Telly and be a dick and cum slanger
When Big Bun come danger, nigga ring your alarm
Sexy thang on my arm, cup of drank in my palm
And that crazy shit, I'm tripping on some skinny bitches
Something that's wholesome, Florida to Folsom
And for the most I'm steady sippin' on some sizzerp
Sippin' on some siz-erp, sip, sippin' on some, sip",https://genius.com/Three-6-mafia-rollin-explicit-album-version-lyrics

We gon' keep on makin money cause this honey is good

I need a down ass chick, thatll roll wit the clique
For the dope sale, bank robbin, cock it back and buck up on a bitch
Kidnap vamp, leave a busters body, in a ditch
Take the charge for you, always drinking liquor
Stayin lit, when we in the bed, baby girl can ride
Like a champ, give a playa head, lickin on my thang
Like a stamp, if I had that I wouldn't trade anything
For her she my main girl, main dog, thats my main whore
(DJ Paul)
Now I can't say that I love her, but I got some love for her
She showed me, she was bout a haul before I really knowed her
I schooled her bout them Glocks, I schooled her bout them rocks
I told her how to hold a spot when I was off the block
She kept it hot, as soon as I stepped in the house she had my money spot
Plus a dro blunt rolled up with a syrup lollipop
The hood tried to holler everyday but it ain't nothin
She down with the King but I still love a ghetto ass chick
(Chorus)
(Crunchy Black)
This one here for the old lady but not dissin this time
This for when you took the charge when I commited the crime
I was out there super high playin mister crash dummy
You put up all my money, didn't take nothing from me
Always found your boy a lawyer when I caught me a case
Paid all my fines and kept up with my court dates
And even though I gave you hell with these other lil broads
You always came and made my bail when I broke the law
The only one thats reliable the one thats dependable
Keep you by my side these other fools is suspendable
I ain't forgot when I was out there hurtin for some cash
You never mind takin your last, on out the stash
Always tried to give me the last up out your purse
Always tried to get my ass to go on and go to church
I couldn't pay you back even if I had to
Hard on these fools but I'll never be to hard on you
