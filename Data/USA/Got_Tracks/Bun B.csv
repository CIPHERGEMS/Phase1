Get Throwed,Trill,2005.0,"Smoke somethin', bitch
UGK, hold up, talkin' 'bout
Uhh

Pimp C, PA trill nigga
Polo fuck that Hilfiger
Made myself a ghetto star
On the slab, sippin' barre
Smokin' weed, sellin' white
Them other niggas shit don't come back right
That's how niggas get popped
Tryna get the cheaper price
Watch yo' paper, guard your life
'Cause most these niggas ain't livin' right
Keep yo' pistol, fuck a fight
'Cause niggas out here jack every night
I keep my mind on my money nigga fuck the fame
Big face hun'erds, keepin' the game
Hittin' the corner in the candy thang
Sittin on leather, grippin' the grain

Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (Yeeeah!)
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed

Well I came in the door, I said it befo'
I never fuck a ho without head no more
I never pour up with nothing less than a four
And I smoke cigars, it ain't just for the show
I'm blessed from the do', and known for my stidile
I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile
You can have the bitch nigga, I ain't sentimental
Smoke weed and freestyle, no instrumental
Been out, lived through the wicked streets of PA
Motherfuck the judge, prosecutor and the DA
Head to the H, where the hoes will fuck threeway
Two way, four way, anyway the Pro say
Never hear a ho say ""no I won't,"" ""no I can't,""
""Stop it,"" and ""no I don't""
'Cause a bitch know that I might just explode
And slap her in the face with a Pie à la Mode
'Cause a nigga gettin' throwed

Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (Yeeeah!)
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed
Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (Yeeeah!)
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed

You already know what it is, nigga
Snowman, 16.5 a piece, nigga, USDA
I grind hard (grind hard) and play harder (play harder)
Break out the pot (YUP) heat up the water (DAMN!)
Swear to God the minivan do tricks
Hit the brakes, hit the lights and voila, there go them bricks
Slide through the hood (HOOD!) sittin on some big wheels
Niggas coppin white and turn flips like cartwheels
Trapstar, my Nextel chirp all day (AYE!)
Ridin' dirty, three nines and a four way (G-YEEEAH!)

Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin; grain (Yeeeah!)
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed

Big money, mayne - we only ride the best
This one and only big homie
Tried to told you I'm thug, ha
Something foreign I’m tourin' on foreign land
Worldwide I'm known for the Arm & Ham-
-mer—der the streets, I'm a wanted man
(But the flow's like dope) So it's on again
Started with the block, hit it brick by brick
Then I charted with the Roc nigga, hit by hit
I'm retarded with the Glock nigga, clip by clip
The competition is none, they deceased to exist
Let it breathe a little bit
He's off his rocker, he's a little schitz'
Throwed like a football, Hov used to cook raw
Now I got the game sewn like granny's good shawl
Pshaw, y'all niggas want war
Y'all got it backwards, y'all should want raw
Y'all should want more (and more, and more - uhh!)

Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (Yeeeah!)
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed
Good weed, good drink, big money, mayne (Aye!)
Rollin' in somethin' foreign, on leather grippin' grain (Yeeeah!)
I handle my business so I think I deserve to get throwed, throwed",https://genius.com/Bun-b-get-throwed-lyrics
Put It Down,Trill OG,2010.0,"Now when it come to makin' money, I'm a printing press (Press)
And when it come to bein' trill, I'm the litmus test
Run it like a fitness test (Test)
And when it come to making history, I'm like Joe's son (Son)
A million ways to die and you already chose one (One)
A million dollars stacked, it sounds like a good beginning ('Ginning)
We on the top now
Go back and tell the hood we winning (Winning)
And while you're there, let 'em know I did it just for them (Them)
I made 'em cough the cash up
And left 'em just the phlegm (Phlegm)
Is that the King of the Trill? Go tell 'em, ""Yes, it's him"" (Him)
And his testosterone is up, who's got the estrogen? ('Gen)
I like your girl and I think she like me even more (More)
I hit her with that heave-and-ho and then I'm leavin' bro (Bro)
The Dirty South's finest, and Dirty South's behind us
Now, that's a plus on the report card, not a minus
Keep your security blankets because I'm not your Linus
You got a problem with us? You know just the spot to find us

Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around
Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around

They know I'm in a Port Arthur state of mind
Southern superstar status (Status), I elevate the grind (Grind)
My time is money, so I put some money on my time
Lightning on the Breitling
So exciting when you see the shine (Shine)
We on a level those before us never even thought of (Thought of)
I broke my bread and fed my team just like the Holy Father (Father)
I helped the blind to see and kept it G just like I oughta (Oughta)
The only thing that's left for us to do is walk on water (Water)
We playing all four quarters 'til the clock expire ('Xpire)
So 'til I see the ref waving, I will not retire ('Tire)
My flow is still official, and I still got the fire (Fire)
Can't take your eyes off me (Off me)
Like when you watch The Wire (Wire)
And in oh-ten (Ten), we finna go in (In)
So let the opposition know that there is no win (Win)
And I am no friend (Friend), so put your hand down (Down)
And tell 'em, ""Stand down"" (Down) before it's ""Man down"" (Down)

Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I
Put it down, put it down
You know how I put it down, put it down

Just bought a car, the nigga Pimp owned it
I threw some tints on it, he woulda loved it how I
Put it down, put it down (Yeah, ugh)
You know how I put it down, put it down
Every time I come around

Round! I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake, mayne—Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time, every day, we switchin' zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later, man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard, nigga; I'm quoted more, nigga
Results are in, I guess you should've voted more, nigga
Swimming in the money, y'all just float ashore, nigga
Never drowning, what the fuck you think this boat is for, nigga?
Yeah, I'm quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends
She bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day I'm riding clean, damn!

Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me
Ask your girl about me, she'll probably tell you that I

You know how I put it down, put it down

You’re Everything,II Trill,2008.0,"Man f'real I love bein from the Dirty South mayne
It made me the G I am today, made me the hustler I am today
The grinder, the baller; the gangster I am today mayne
Lot of people got opinions and, issues and, problems with
What they see comin from the South and who doin what in the South mayne
But I'mma tell you like this - FUCK YOU DAWG~! This the South nigga
We gon' be here, we been here, and ain't goin no motherfuckin where
Take it how you like it, hate it or love it ho!

It's that candy paint, 84's, belts and buckles, chrome and grill
Leather seats, stitch and tuck, TV screens and wooden wheels
Suede roof, neon lights, Vogue tire swang and bang
Tops drop, blades chop, fifth wheel just hangin mayne
White T's, fitted hats, Jordans under dickies (dickies)
That Swisher sweet, cigarillos filled up with the sticky (sticky)
The fifteens bam'n and the bass kick-kickin
Cadillac do's slammin on them po'-po's tippin
We ain't trippin just flippin these haters dip when they see us (dip when they see us)
Cause they could never beat us best us or be us
I'm a G that's a genius, best to just respect my thuggin mayne
It's the South, ain't nothin above it and that's why I love it mayne!

Yeah, keepin it trilla baby; Texas, P.A. to H-Town

Pray at night when you sellin white, got one ki' tryin to sell it twice
Yellow stones all in my shit, yellowbones all on my dick
Honeycomb I call my crib, money long that's on my kids
R.I.P. to my Uncle Chad, UGK you can't fuck wit that
Niggas fake, they hate candy paint, and all the paper that your partner make
Shakin dice like a face of life, champagne just ain't tastin right
Haterade they Gatorade, look at these seats they gator made
Friend or foe niggas never know (know) never know when you fin' to blow

Dude scrapin the curb, dippin sippin some syrup
Fingers blistered twisted Swishers, Pimp died and it hurt
But I handle my issue, I got several pistols
That won't whistle, missles knockin gristle from fatty tissue
Mississippi's my home, 'til I'm die and I'm gone
I know I put it on my back, held that bitch up alone
With no label b-backin, pride split into fractions
I hit the ocean on peggy bustin back at the crackin
And y'all scared (y'all scared)

You're everything I knew! (Ohh yeah)

Get on my knees for you (ohhhhhhhhhh bab-bayyy)

The Dirty South, is everything I want
Everything I need, everything I'm longin for
When I'm outta town gotta get home, just for
Everything that I been raised to love, the wisdom my grandmomma gave to us
Racial profilin, police harassment regular days to us
You say door, we say do'; you say four, we say fo'
You say whore, we say ho; you want more, but we want mo'
What else is there left for me to do?
This the dedication from me to you
The South, I know you gonna see, me through
So until I die I wanna be, wit'chu

Damn I’m Cold,II Trill,2008.0,"Chops on the track!
Ooh, yeah
Damn, I'm cold, damn, I'm cold
Ooh, yeah
Damn, I'm cold, damn, I'm cold

See, when I got Mercedes money, I went and got a Mercedes
When I got that Bentley money, I went and got that Bentley
Now, if you ain't help me make it, don't tell me how to spend it
And yes, I know the rules: never marry Robin Givens
Mozzarella over bitches, so we call them bitches cheeseheads
Lambeau Leap in that pussy like in Green Bay
Lambo' sweet, look like sugar on the freeway
And I'm riding dirty, 'cause I'm so UGK
One, two, three, wait; four-four makes eight
Nine times out of ten, it's 11 or a 12-gauge
Friday the 13th: that's the day that hell raise
But y'all boys too weak, like fourteen days
I'm so clean; why wouldn't I be?
I be with Ben Frank so much, he starting to look like me
I'ma smoke my weed, 'cause I don't want to smoke yours
And I pour four every time I pour

Like, was you saying something bitch?
You ain't talking 'bout us, you ain't talking 'bout shit
I woke up this morning, eyes half-closed
I looked into the mirror and say, ""Damn, I'm cold""
Damn, I'm cold, and my ho (Ooh, yeah)
Pimp shit, nigga, keep paying my hoes (Damn, I'm cold)
Damn, I'm cold, man, I'm throwed
I say damn, I'm cold, hot-damn, I'm cold

See, when I got that slab money, I put the Rivy on blades (Blades)
When I got that 'Lac money, I candied the Escalade ('Lade)
Got that Screw in my deck, a house or two on my neck
A couple cars on my wrist, and bitch, I'm ready to wreck
We 'bout to do this for Pimp C (Yeah), so pass me a bottle
I'm 'bout to pop the top on it, like a slab or a model (Man...)
Turn it upside-down, and pour it out for my lil' bro (Huh)
And pass me another one so I can pour out a lil' more (Fa' sho')
Fresher than Ozium, cleaner than wax floors, I'm...
(What?) Slick as linoleum, swinging my 'Lac doors, them...
(What?) Franklins, you folding them, we trying to stack those
So 'fore you play the role, you need to learn how to act, hoes (Hoes)
Swingers'll clang fours and tipping trunks'll bang (Bang)
Haters get back, and hoes'll flip, and nuts'll hang (Hang)
It ain't a thang, ain't never was, and never will
I put that on my life, Bun Beeda forever trill (For real)

Yeah, fucking right, alright
Going at your neck like a fucking dog bites
I woke up this morning, eyes half-closed
I looked into the mirror and say, ""Damn, I'm cold""
Damn, I'm cold, and my ho (Ooh, yeah)
Pimp shit, nigga, keep paying my hoes (Damn, I'm cold)
Damn, I'm cold, man, I'm throwed
I say damn, I'm cold, hot-damn, I'm cold

Is it the ice in the piece or the ice in the chain? (Chain)
Is it the ice in the watch or the ice in the rings? (Rings)
Or the bracelet? Face it: you feel a chill in your veins (Veins)
Could it be from Bun Beeda or that boy Lil Wayne? (Wayne)
Could it be the two-seater on them thangs?
Got on a couple gold chains, so Dana Dane
I swang and bang from lane to lane
Yeah, it's getting hot, and you starting to feel the flame
Bun! It's getting brick, and you starting to feel a breeze
And the temperature's going down (Down)
Best to get you some sleeves
And you best to get you some Gs (Gs)
'Fore you lose your control ('Trol)
And we turn your whole neighborhood into the North Pole
Like, brr, machine gun, brrrr-rrrr-rrrr
I am a beast, grrrr, money machine, brrrr-rrrr-rrrr
F-U-C-K, C-O-P-S
I say, ""I know,"" when they say, ""Freeze!""

Ha, yeah! Okay, you already know
No pussies, no rats, no Tom and Jerry show
I woke up this morning, eyes half-closed
I looked into the mirror and say, ""Damn, I'm cold""
Damn, I'm cold, and my ho (Ooh, yeah)

Bun B

I said, ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right?
 Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

You should come with me
If you got some time this is where you wanna be
We can go all night long
This can last all night
Bet it's goin' down, we gon make it right
This is what they mean when they talk about the life
We can go all night long
This can last all night

Tell them open up the doors, they gotta let us in
It's rap oldest rookie and it's youngest veteran
Go get us Sprite its for the drink, back together bitch
Mr. Doin' It doin' it, what could be better bitch
The dynamic duo, a two-man dream team
My pockets stay swollen, call me Mr. Cream Jean
Rocking white diamonds, that vanilla cream bling
They got the game locked down, call it sing sing
You cats straight down in Houston, me proper dos
In a corner booth chilling with some proper hoes
I hit Toronto girls, hold me for ransom
Til I let 'em buy me Polo or they throw me ransom
Damn son, it's like the best of both worlds
That's your wifey and your side, ya getting the best of both girls
So I'ma go ahead and leave the clock running
I ain't finna stop going, you ain't finna stop coming
When the head boy banging, it's like the Funky Drummer drumming
I go right to left and left to right, back to forth, it's nothing
This is something for the gangstas, something for the riders
With a pistol and the money and boppa right beside us
We highly flammable, you better not ignite us
You suffering from put one in the pussy nigga ride us

Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off

James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop

Well it's big Bun B now, baby, Mr. Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them balling through your hood mayn
And I'm smoking on some good mayn, the color purple
Not the movie, but the kind that have you going in a circle
Chrome, looking more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin' candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like 'Face I got the money, the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundred-thousand round my neck
I'm looking real shiny; you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doing it, until I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turning lane
Pop my trunk, break you off, chunk a deuce
And I'm Cadillac turning mayn (I'm gone)
Little swang to the left, big swang to the right
My plates scraping and I'm sliding the pipe, 
it's super tight
So don't try to knock us baby, don't try to hate
That's how we do it in that Lone star state; get it straight

Now if you never been to Texas, there's a picture to paint
Cause we doing it real big, in case you thinking we ain't
It's lots of money on these streets, being spent and being made
All it take is one look to see these boys getting paid
They living laid in big houses, with pools in the backyard
Certified gangsters so you never see us act fraud
With iced out watches, bracelets, chains
Pieces, teeth, mayn we throwed in the game
We got screens in that headrest, visors in the ceiling
On chrome 83's and fours and Vogue peeling
With bumpers and belts across the back of my trunk
Push a button, and my car is waiving bye to you punk
We from the land of sippin' on syrup and (banging the Screw)
We slab swangin' comin down and through, I thought you knew
Back in the days, all they ever did was doubt us
Now the South is in the house, and they can't do nothing about us

Draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking bout (x4)]

One time for my trill niggas reppin the block
The real soldiers on the frontline is keeping it cocked
They hold it down for they hood, throw it up, let 'em see it
So they can know how you G it, if they hating, so be it
We ain't playing where I'm staying cause it's way too real
No matter the situation, we gotta keep it trill
Got the steel on my side when I ride cause I'm ready
I got 20/10 vision and my trigger finger steady
I'm an Underground King homeboy, and not a simp
And I gots to represent 'til they decide to free the Pimp
I'm down for my click, just like I'm down for my block
And I'm a stand up for my partner 'til they let him off of lock
So go on, body rock, Southside or lean back
Two-step with your boy if you about your greenbacks
This here is a Texas toast so raise your glass
Because the whole dirty South fittin' to show they naked ass

So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town

Then you should persuade her to let me get some sex in
Don't get offended, baby, that's just a suggestion
Really we can do it however..you..like

Whatever floor that me and 40 staying on is smelling riiight

Oh yeah, and I know we gon' get it
Me and Jeezy bout whatever, shorty, holla if you with it
Even though I want it to this shit don’t last forever
But better late than never, honestly I’d like to say it's been a pleasure

Emotions in this game run deep
So before these haters kill me in my sleep
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Reppin' 'til my last second through
Done a lot of shit they'll never get to do
I'd like to say it's been a pleasure
Honored to be somebody they mention
But before these niggas stop payin' attention
I'll just say it's been a pleasure
You'll never be somebody they need
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, so tonight we gon' do it like this
Ohhhh, for the H-Town
Tonight I'm gon' make some money go
For the H-Town",https://genius.com/Bun-b-its-been-a-pleasure-lyrics
Fire,Trill OG: The Epilogue,2013.0,"It's, it's, it's, it's, it's Serani and Bun B

When the heat is on we burn hotter than fire
People will burn up on, we burn hotter than fire
Turn my enemies to dust, burn them up with fire
Whether life or death, guess we're far from fire

Murder murder redrum
 - mami, I done dead them
Rude boy like Ashanti, 
take his motherfucking head from
His shoulders, this is Bedlam - mayhem, chaos
Competition cease and seckle already, they lost
Thinking they boss like the Triple C's CEO
Fuck them, they would be D.O.A 
ASAP, you see me, ho
Me, you, and D.O.G, that’s why the fuck they ducking me
Rude boy, now deal with the fuckery, we bucking G
The ghetto red hot, the youth and the care play
Pussy and lit up match shots now in the air
Motherfucker beware 'til I retire or expire
Cyanide in them, know that we are coming with more fire


Big belly man, big belly man man
Big belly man, I'm that big belly man
Big black benz, 20% tints
100 niggas on my team,
 20% friends
After four or five lines you know this organized crime
Me still buying jewels
, 
I got on more than last time
This not a past time, this a landslide
And I'm bringing more fire, better get your hands up
Get out my beamer, you know I like my trigga finger crew
Get with a boss and maybe you could get a beamer too
Burning down the strip from Texas to Kingston
As a dime stand in line just dying to squeeze in
Ross


Who want to test this? Titty 2 necklace
Money so tall she gotta count it in Giuseppe
Balling like the ESPY's
Drinking on that Texas
Sexting. texting, aggravated flexing
Did it for the money
 and the fame came with it
Connect from the island and the cane came with her
Rode through the block in a cherry colored drop
Jim Carrey, Mariah Carey, you get carried off
They got a stretcher with your name on
Shoot a nigga and I’ll dash like damon
Insane in the membrane
2 Chainz, but today I got on three chainz",https://genius.com/Bun-b-fire-lyrics
Pushin,Trill,2005.0,"Pushin', keep on pushin'
I've got to keep on pushin'

Say man I don't give a fuck about the feds
D.E.A., A.T.F., Task Force, Jump-out boys
Or your local neighborhood robbers
Baby I got to keep on pushin'

Well it's the king of the hubba trade and the sergeant of snow (snow)
They call me Mr. Killa Gram in case yo ass ain't know (Know)
I'm the boss baller of blow when you come to the Gulf (Gulf)
Other cats holdin' some weight but they ain't holdin' enough
I've been around way before the Interstate was on fire (Fire)
Before they hid it in the gas or the tire (Tire)
Before a motherfucker even knew about a stash box
We just put work in the back of the car (Man), and mashed out (For real)
Now ask a nigga that was doin' it in nine-three
On the Interstate in a rental car you can find me
Suitcase is stuffed like a holiday turkey (Turkey)
Chopper right beside in case a nigga try to jerk me (Jerk me)
I did the city thing plus I played it out of state
Either way a nigga was known for havin' a lot of weight
Try to knock me down but it only made me bigger
Haters wanna see me fall but a nigga gotta keep on pushin'

I feel you Bun, I feel you Young, I mean, I feel you
I'm on the corner from sun up to sun down
Competition gettin' hectic, I'm headed for out of town
What I was, sellin' for twenty, niggas sellin' for ten
So I'm bout to take it to drastic measurements for my ends
My partner Rob in seventeen and in the Benz
And me I'm in a bucket but fuck it, that's how it is, shit
I got an ounce about to cut it into stones
Next stop: Port Arthur, Texas, I work it in the Lones
I'm a little nigga on his hustle bout to rise
I was cuttin' seventeen and I was only payin' five
A week went by, and a nigga took that dry
Back to H-Town, with re-up about to score me nine
A Pyrex bulb and the whoop so throwed
I cooked it for nine then I stretched it for nine more
Whoa, I'm that nigga bakin' with holes in his door
Crummy niggas sellin' that ether but fuck it, shit sold

Ay, no matter how hard it get you know I'mma…
Real talk, real niggas do real things you know they… (CHEEAAA)
You already know, free Pimp C nigga (LIFE NIGGA)

Real niggas do real things nigga you already know nigga
C.T.E. nigga, Rap-A-Lot records (AYE, AYE, AYE)
One day you're here, the next day you're gone (WHAT?)
Cuz some nigga set you up on the phone (DAMN)
Shit, I play it how I go, I'm in a league of my own
You ain't gotta front me shit nigga, I'm buyin' my own (HAHA)
Whether it's sixteen bars or sixteen bricks (CHEA)
Move 'em one at a time, I'll take sixteen trips (LET'S GET IT)
I'm in the kitchen with the white, choppers by the back door (AYE)
Mind on my money, but I swear this shit stack dough (HAHA)
Square's in the closet, a hundred thousand in the box spring
Got the stash box in the back of the Mustang (CHEA)
You know I keep a down ass bitch to dry that shit
Look, I-T a nigga yea she ride that shit
Hey, I hustle harder, I hustle smarter (AYE)
Just left the magnum lot tried to whip me up a charter (HAHA)
I'm so ahead of my time, ahead of my grind
Look at snowman bitch, it's a must that I shine (YEAAAA)
See my watch is like...damn, my ears beggin' for attention (AYE)
A quarter mill around my neck, in case I forgot to mention

Live for, all off in your billfold to make her happy
She shake you off, I break her off cause she bring it back to daddy
Don’t be mad at me, cause your ho done chose

The new President of the South
Yo Bun, it's your time
And we dedicate this one to all our brothers and sisters
Who suffered at the hands of the enemy

It's been a long time comin' but it finally came
For Bun B to get his motherfuckin' shot in the game
I put mo' work in than an average trill nigga can put
And I'mma gangsta from my head to my foot
Blacker than soot, I got the hood behind me
The street's co-signed me
Head ported in the ghetto (man), you know where to find me
The mission is laid out and the vision is clear
From this moment I run the South and everything down here
From the corners and cuts, trap spots and blocks
Whether it's rappin' or work, I got the shit on lock
I ain't wit' all that back talkin', sneak dissin', or plexin'
I'mma tell ya how I feel cause I'mma god damn Texan
'Bout time for me to start eliminatin' the fraud
Cause this a White House of cards, filled wit' nuthin but broads
We gon' run them hoes out and put some trill niggas in
Cause what happened in New Orleans, should never happen again
They been sittin' on they ass, doin' much about nuthin
For too god damn long, and I'm tired of the frontin'
I'mma instigate a change from the motherfuckin' top
Cause this bullshit they pullin' on my people gotta stop
So I'm here to make a stand (stand) and take up the slack

A gangsta ain't cha clothes (clothes), a gangsta ain't cha hat (hat)
Your watch, rang, and chain - naw, a gangsta ain't that! (at all!)
A gangsta can have that, but he ain't gotta show it (why?)
Cause with or without it he's still a gangsta and you know it
From my head to my toe wit it, it ain't hard to see

A gangsta don't forget where he came from, no matter
Where he go or where he been, keep it gangsta 'til the end
Cause I'm a gangsta (yep), and I'mma always love my city
Make money but don't act like I'm above my city (Never!)
Cause gangstas, will always give back to the ghetto
And gangstas, will never turn they back to the ghetto
That's a fact in the ghetto, it's never been a lie (lie)

I'm a rider 'til the wheels go ballin', they blow out
One hundred and one percent G and it's no doubt
That if you need a man to make you feel secure
Then baby, you ain't gotta look no more, I got the cure
You want money and jewels, you want clothes and cars
Wanna live VIP, rubbin' shoulders with stars
Wanna fly in G4's or sail the seas
Then your wish is my command, you can do what ya please
The lap of luxury is what you'll be layin' in
Just respect the player and the game that he's playin' in
I can show you a side of life you never seen

Take a trip to port her off to the beach
Tell her homie hold it down 'cause we hustle to eat
And got me feelin' like I lost my Jones
I done lost my home so H town, it's on
And nuttin' change 'cause the palms got chrome
Nigga do this in the early 'cause we gettin' it on
And baby girl, you could shop alone
And fly the 4 to France and take a hundred bones

If you need love, I'm lovin', if you need a thug, I'm thuggin'
If you need a hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down
Need a lil' dough, we flippin', got somewhere to go, I'm whippin'
Be a love hustla, whatever you need, girl, I'ma hold you down",https://genius.com/Bun-b-hold-u-down-lyrics

I got the whole game, in my head
Don't fuck for recreation but I'm good in the bed
Tony Snow, I keep big blow
My homeboy gal wanna fuck me on the low
But I don't wanna 'less she goin' out on the grind
Check-in with the choosin' fee and I'ma knock her from behind
I make a bitch bleed the block
With a certified knot and a platinum cock
The pimpin' didn't stop, even when the bids died
We just kept on gettin' high, puttin' dick up in they eye
Dick up in they ears,
 dick up in they nose
Ass, pussy, mouth, I'm fin' ta fuck in every hole
Put it between they titties and between they toes
That's how a gushy gush out when ya bitch get chose

You know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight
So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or slow down
You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to go down right now

Eternally thug nigga,
 Hilfiger made by Tommy
So when I speak, hope to reach my boricua mamis
Oh, come to papi, I love it when it's wet and sloppy
In and out the mouthpiece until I cum, no one can stop me
My bump and grind'll do ya everytime
Come get a blast of this thug passion that'll blow your mind, hey
Throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a Westside thang, fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' down hotties
And they, seduce my jimmy, out and screamin', ""Gimme body""
Make 'em all scream my name out, gimme my props
And don't ya, love how this thug nigga, be at the cot
I'm at the Rican Parade, I'm watchin' caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit'll never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend, now c'mon

You know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight
So be ready, to get sweaty, speed up or slow down
You want it, get up on it, it's 'bout to go down right now

Look here shawty, lemme tell you what the game is
And while I'm at it, lemme tell you what my name is
Bun Beeda, big D up in my drawls
When I pull out my piece, it make the girls all pause
Y'allz, niggas, better recognize
When ya bitch choose me, shouldn't come as a surprise
Knew she was a freak, I could see it in her eyes
And I'ma bring it out her when I get between her thighs
God damn, that's what you call a home run
I knock it out the park when I give her the long one
It's on, I'm ready, it's strong, it's steady
First I'ma get me some becky and beat up the belly
When the sheets start shiftin' and the bed starts rockin'
And the headboard's bangin', playa don't come knockin'
It's a grown folks party, we don't need no kids
And I ain't tryna blow you up, but gurl yo pussy the shit

You know, and I know, we need to get right
I'ma call you, and I'm comin' through after midnight

Stop Playin,Trill OG: The Epilogue,2014.0,"I'm the one-man army, Bun B
I've never been taken out
I keep emcees breaking out
I'm bringing real rap back and
Taking the faking out
I'm clearing all the bullshit out the way
To make a vacant route
OK, now let the real niggas roll through
It's going for you new niggas and the old too
It was some bullshit then and it's some bullshit now
So I'm just tryna keep the bullshit down
They say the rap game needs balance to keep it level
Just like the EQ with the bass, mid, and treble
And yeah that's true but if you wanna point blame
Just be careful about the motherfucking way you aim
You blame radio, internet, and politics
But see, we all really know it's just a pile of shit
You not playing cause your music ain't hitting
The people don't like you, stop hating, start quitting muthafucka

You saying you the man, that's the kid in you
Because we knowing what you did and what you didn't do
It's not the shit you say, It's the shit you not saying
You know better, show better, step it up and stop playing
Stop playing

Niggas be lying, talking about they bust a heater
Once I see him, they be more like Justin Bieber
Leave it, my rivals underground like SkyZoo's how I do
I have em laying on the ground bleeding
Butt naked with a bullet in his motherfucking head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in being in the place where
I'm wearing Gucci mane, getting white boy wasted
I tell a nigga break bread or take lead
I'm trying to get rid of this weight, K-Fed
Me and Bun got the gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime fame, to you that ain't the prom
I'm not a fan of no man, I'm not Stan
Flow like Niagra, that's why they go, God damn
I whip it up in the kitchen like pots and pans
I'm God-like, when I'm praying I should stand


No rapper can rap quite like I can
Now take your best-known rapper and make him a fan
I'm the man homeboy, been running the block
I make you say Go Reggie and do the wop
, ha ha
And I'm Doc, the niggas are hating
My flow and your swag, it don't relate
Cause I'm grrreat
Jewels like Frosted Flakes
Light-skinned, just one shade darker than Drake
I hold weight when the camera rolling
It's like golf how I got the US Open
Nigga I'm nice, I see you scoping
Think twice before you move that close in
That's my dosage, call me tomorrow
Look so fly when you call me a barber
Everything I write, call me the author
Baby I'm back, sorry I lost you",https://genius.com/Bun-b-stop-playin-lyrics

Triller,Trill OG: The Epilogue,2013.0,"Triller
Say ain't nobody triller
I'm a motherfuckin killer
Say ain't nobody triller
And you know it's for real

Wake up in the morning, give thanks to the Lord
For giving me another day so I can go hard
Never been fraud, always kept it true
Get dressed, hit the street try ta' see what it do
Cut a few corners, chunk a few dubs
Get 'em, jump back, trill niggas show love
Some try to hate, I don't pay it no mind
Either get with me or get like me – that's on the grind
Candy paint shine as I flip through the city
Ridin' 84s, and them hoes look pretty
Had dirty money way before P Diddy
I'm just tryna squeeze a little more milk up out the titty
Is ya with me?

I'mma put it down my nigga
Gotta do what I do for the town my nigga
Boys talking down on a nigga
But since day one I've been a killer
Mayne and ain't nobody triller
Say ain't nobody triller
I'm a motherfucking killer
H-Town in this bitch
And you know it's for real

Riding drop top in the Fleetwood Lac
The sun is shining down on my Astros hat
I'm all about the cheese but I never been a wreck
Gotta keep it to yo self, what part of the game is that?
You see me rollin 4's on them foes, just flipping
Leaning on the leather through the Southside dipping
You know I got the gat up on my lap with the clip in
Cock back ready but these boys ain't tripping
Who run this bitch? Don't even bother
My granddaddy did, he passed it to my father
My father did his thing like a G
He passed it down to me
Now the neighborhood belong to Bun B, OG


Pussy niggas need to stay off in they lane
Sitting sidelines, want to quarterback the game
Back seat drivers get to talking too much
But not when I'm around, cause they know they get touched
It's the city called Clutch, and that's how we come through
Fake niggas runnin up? What the fuck they gon' do?
P.A. trill nigga, no Hilfiger
Put it on yo ass, before when we still wheel nigga
New niggas in the game, get your share
Long as you ain't touching mine, bitch I really don't care
Sets in the air, twist yo fingers til they break

For the game",https://genius.com/Bun-b-triller-lyrics
The Story,Trill,2005.0,"Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said
Wake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed
Hurting my heart and hanging over my head
Bout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred
C.L. Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C
The closest homeboy that I ever had
Now when we first met, we wasn't on the same page
From petty misunderstandings that got clearer with age
Two young boys who was ready to mash
Put P.A. on the map and maybe make a little cash
Jumped down with Bigtyme, put down a few songs
Everybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong
Then hit the streets with a big ass bang
Them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang
Dropped Tell Me Something Good took off and went live
Shit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive
Dropped Too Hard to Swallow, A Pocket Full of Stones
Put the remix on ""Menace"" shit we had it going on
Got love in the streets and played on the air
But the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair
Had to separate ourself, bring in a new team
But sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems
We dropped ""Super Tight"" a album full of killer flows
But then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes
We didn't realize what was happening on the real
And new management was cutting back room deals
Hiding different money and concealing the price
He had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice
Took a while to catch on, to what homey was doing
But by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins
Nigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes
The next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes
Pimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six
Better get your paper together, get this shit fixed
Remixed the management team and tried it ourself
Cussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf
Fuck it, dropped ""Ridin' Dirty"" instant classic in the South
Reclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth
Got some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest
But meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters
The old manager calling and say he fina' sue
And put a padlock on the everything we trying to do
Put a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating
We got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting
He made a call or two to some folks, tellin' 'em, man
You gotta cut UGK some slack understand
Young Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl
Rap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive
We got the big bosses on the same page
So me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage
Next thing you know we got this call from the N.Y
It's Jay-Z saying y'all niggas getting fly
He doing ""Volume 3"" and got a track from Timb
And wondered could some trill niggas rock it with him
Shit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure
But ""Big Pimpin"" hit 'em 187-Pure
Number one song on every station you turn on
MTV and BET we getting our burn on
Grammy nominated can't believe that we made it
And we got a call from Jive that left us all faded
And it stated, that due to the success of the track
We here at Jive records, would like to piggy back
Get another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay
Let Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way
Shit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask
If we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast
A song like that would might take a nigga to the top
But my true fan base, might think a nigga flop
They got mad and put niggas on hold
For damn near a year till the buzz got cold
So we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics
Trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix
We put ""Dirty Money"" together and it was aces
But that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases
He got probation, said fuck you hoes
We finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows
And then he violated, one month before we dropped
And shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped
Now 30 days done, we back to the nitty gritty
Album got released, big showdown in Chocolate City
Niggas with masks on, vests and all black
It's Christmas 2001, bitch we was all that
Strongest on the block, nobody could budge
And then he violated, now we right back before the judge
They calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence
It was January 28th, he ain't been home since
Threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses
(In)'stead of co-CEO, now I'm the fuckin boss
Had the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging
Had to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging
So I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees
Put my hands together and I prayed Lord please
Let me get past this bridge over water that's trouble
And get back up on my grind on the double
He said son don't worry
Cause it's not really hard as it seem
And I can turn your nightmares back into dreams
You just got to stay true to yourself and to ‘C
Then push away from the devil and get closer to me
And every since that night man I promise I been on it
Giving that killer flow to anybody who want it
Pimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G
Not to mention I got the world screaming ""Free Pimp C""
So soon as you make parole and they open the doors
You ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours
Ain't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' strife
I kept it real because to me it's UGK for life",https://genius.com/Bun-b-the-story-lyrics

I was so bull-headed down the road I was headed
Had to slow down and walk with myself
Had to talk to myself, argue and fought myself
Yeah, I had told myself
The road never stroll down there

You lookin' aight, Big Mike
Big money, big car, big house, big booty wife

That's your car, your house, your wife
I'm just sayin' you can have that

You ain't gotta drop outta college
And watch your grand mama ask the law, ""Lord, why did he do it?""
You ain't gotta make love to the girl
You don't really love, y'all have a baby and go through it
What's really so bad? The game that I'm givin' is golden
'Cause it was gotten straight from dad
""Did you listen to him, Mike?"" Wish I had
It's my life, it ain't that bad (Yeah)

I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to take care of mine and mine and mine and mine alone

In the pot was some Ramen noodles and Spam
And I was like damn and this is some bullshit
I don't want to live like this
I just want a chain that rains and nice wrists
Why the hell can't I have me some nice shit?
But instead of complainin' I started aimin' higher
My passion matched my desire, now I just spit out that fire
And never get tired, you can put that on a choir
Yeah, man, I got me suppliers
And made some mistakes but guess what?
That shit don't define me (Define me)
That's why you find me grindin'
From the 90s until I'm in my nineties (Nineties)
Shinin, no need to rewind me
Said it before and they scared to repeat it
I came to give the people game they needed
Until my life is depleted (Life is depleted)
Your life is a bitch and it's best to be mindful
Of how you gon' treat it (How you gon' treat it)
'Cause if you catch a case with the Devil, my nigga
I'm down for your beatin' (I'm down for your beatin')
Can't get away from the choices you make
And the way you behavin' (The way you behavin')
So don't be surprised when the throne that you sit in
Is startin' to cave-in

I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to take care of mine and mine and mine and mine alone
And the folk that need me to be strong
I got to hold my own, I got to write my wrongs
I got to let God steer
I got to take myself, I got to help myself to live
I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own, I got to write my wrongs
I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own, I got to write my wrongs
Protect myself

Hey, I got a foot trapped in quicksand (Ay)
I got my hand stuck in blender (Ay)
Walk with a heart that been bruised up
Still got a couple of beats left in
What a surprise, I'm not dead yet
Got a couple of friends that can't claim that
They throwin' the bones that got 1-1
Eyes of the State, no fun fun
Woke up in the dawn, alone, the mood hung there, yawnin'
I don't see calm that often
Lit the stick in her hair with no coughed
I'm walkin' the Earth again, better get poppin'
Check the old gold watch, I ride often
It don't mean much, but it's mine, I copped it
Have it on my wrist 'til my heart starts stoppin'
Good to remind, then I'm lyin' inside coffins
I don't advise, who am I to act wise?
Nine out of ten times the swine had arised, so I lie
It ain't a-okay
Eh, you get nine bucks they want eight?
Tryna chase you and parade around Mace
Try to remind myself they will pay
You don't got shit, take a bit of mind games
Stick around maybe bring your pain to these lames

I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to take care of mine and mine and mine and mine alone
And the folk that need me to be strong
I got to hold my own, I got to write my wrongs
I got to let God steer
I got to take myself, I got to help myself to live
I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own, I got to write my wrongs
I got to make these moves, I got to pay my dues
I got to hold my own, I got to write my wrongs
Protect myself",https://genius.com/Bun-b-myself-lyrics
Gone Away,Return of the Trill,2018.0,"All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go

Now my brother was loud, but my brother was proud
And my brother made sure that he stood out in a crowd
Yeah, my brother wore glasses but he saw so clear
And my brother knew God so he had no fear
No fear of these haters, no fear of these clones
My brother wasn't concerned, and he made that known
Yeah, my brother was spoiled, but my brother was loyal
Late nights of hard work, me and my brother would toil
Yeah, my brother made me laugh 'cause my brother was funny
But you best not ever fuck around with my brother's money
'Cause my brother would snap and then that's all that she wrote
And it's a line under that, as my brother would quote
Yeah, my brother's a mothafucka if I'm tellin' the truth
But man he kept it 100 in and out of the booth
So when I talk about my brother, I smile and I cry
Because I know he's watchin' over me, sittin' on high

All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay
All my woes and all my lows
Won't change my soul 'cause I have to go
All my friends have gone away
So long to them, but I have to stay

Late Night Creepin’,Trill,2005.0,"Well when the moon comes up and the sun goes down
And the street lights start comin' on in the town
When the kids go inside and old foks go to sleep
Thats when real G's come out on the creep
Midnight movin through the city on the low
Sippin' on some sizurp and smokin on some dro
Got the TVs on, both my screens on flow
Pop trunk on dis bitch and I'm ready to go
You never know what the night might hold
After hours motherfuckers act way too cold
You see work gettin bought, and work gettin sold
If you real you can roll, but if you fake you might fold
Now a days its a struggle to survive
Some of these dark alley ways will eat you alive
I'mma grip my grain, and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin...

Cause we don't come out till after dark
With nothing less than 28 grams of spark
And nothing less than 16 ounces of sip
Everytime that its time to flip
You can find me
Rollin through the hood leanin in the lac'
With a woman on the front and a fifth in the back
Haters on the prowl and the one time peepin'
We don't give a fuck we just late night creepin'
In the late night
Thats w, thats w
Thats when real G's c come out on the creep

I got my two 4-5s and they loaded and locked
Keep em' both on cock for I step on the block
It's the grave yard shit cause we out on the grind
And we don't care about time cause its money on mind
We the first ones out tryin to get us some bread
We ain't worried bout sleep fuck goin to bed
We the last ones to leave after hittin them stangs
Take it back to the boulevard with four's on swang
I do my thing and you can't tell me different
Cross the wrong line and your body might skip it
I'm programmed automatic with this G shit
And that go for every other cat you see me with
Glock turned on with the burn on the hip
I'm blowin on the deuce by the candy painted whip
I'mma grip my grain, and cock my gun
And show these mother fuckers how its done
When your late night creepin.....

In the late night better get your face right
Everything sells, bitches to the bass pipe
I seen it all eyes redder than a brake light
Blood shot 20 20 through the guage sight
I'm in a gold lac bought it all from sold sacks
I ain't braggin homie these are just the cold facts
We known to hold gats and nobody hold back
Fuck a cheap shot i'll take out your whole back
So bring your whole pack better bring an extra clip
Ain't nobody walk away cause ain't nobody give a shit

Somethin like the smell of crap when I'm watchin your noodle blow
We famous pharmisuticals and breakin the bits
We blazin two up in the cuticals to breakin the bread
Don't give a shit you never heard of us

For toatin heavy metal push the good shit pour the purple up

That 84s and vogue flows that niggas can't fuck wit'
Tippin' on fo'fos shit, slammin' Cadillac doors shit
That ""Not only is it real, but it's realer than your shit!""
Woodgrain wheel and the candy paint mandatory

Money, cups and swangas (swangas), tops chopped with that trunk lit
Chunk a deuce with fingers (fingers), boy, we ain't on that punk shit
Gulfway veteran that ain't too many better than
Say he wanna dance with the devil, then fuck it, let him in
We don't bar niggas, droppin' bars while we on barre
Yeah, you might be on, bitch, but you know you ain't on par
When I pull up on a pussy nigga with that chrome boy
Shut his slab down, he gon' have to call up OnStar

In Event, bangin' ol' flows from the Swishahouse
Wrist lit up, your bitch on my dick, hoe, get up
Drinkin' drank by the pint, tryin' to sit up, don't pull your shit up
When you see me, 'cause it's Fader, I'm in my drop 5/9 watchin' cable
Newest one out the stable, no labels, black-owned 'til I'm gone
Still comin' through Acres Homes like it's money on my phone
I'm a grown-ass boss, still like to floss
For two decades straight I've been pullin' out
Paint cost 20 grand, got 'em lookin' like, ""Damn!""

I stand 5 foot 10, two hundred and a half
One hundred percent gangsta, don't smile and don't laugh
In a 3X shirt, nigga 38 waist
I ain't small motherfucker, I'm takin' up some space
Wit' a size 11 shoe that'll kick ya in ya face
Bitch I'm all about a crime embedded and catch a case
I ain't scared to kick in ya door and look around ya place
I ain't scared to count back to four and put one in ya face
K steel nigga, favorite deuce-deuce and a third
Teflon coat and ya body, juice loose on the curb
I serve you like a tennis ball, straight up diminish y'all
I position the competition and when I'm finished
Y'all can clear the calendar, call authority and tell they next of kin
We shot 'em like a crackhead, stabbed 'em up like a Mexican
May he never flex again, not like he can
But just in case he get resurrected it's best he understand

I see these niggas do a lot of talkin' but they never back it up
Thought the work that they movin', all the paper they stackin' up
You niggas got me crackin' up
The only thing you sellin' is wolf tickets, and we ain't buyin' them so pack it up
84's, click-clack it up and down Thomas
From Westside to the East, we keep it ""G"" and that's a promise
Bunch of black Osama's, America's Most Wanted
We criminal backgrounds, we ready to straight flaunt it
All it take is a sawed, drop a ho and instigator
Messy motherfuckers got to make it for an instant hater
I'mma lay ya down, like a baby ready to nap
Cause I'mma trill nigga ready to clap, now was'hap?
I slap a nigga, stupid with a back hand wraith
And continue 'til nobody from your wack clan left
Bitch you might cheat death and you might cheat the dealer
But you never cheat the king of the underground on the realer

Raised off Efectos and three for ten suites
Rest in peace Lil Don and Dee Ray, they was the hardest to me
See this trill way of life is part of me like a artery
And when it comes to, it ain’t no bargain
So to the ones misinformin’, here’s your fair warnin'
We trill over everything
Nah, for real

My Cadillac and my chrome rims, stitch and tuck and my paint job
Vogue tires, my neon lights, trunk on bang and my shit hard
Top drop and my trunk pop, woodgrain and it’s all new
Spruced up and I’m juiced up and my deuce chunked when I fall through
Piece 'n chain and my gold ring, Rolex and that bezel lit
I’m G’ed up from the feet up, when we meet up, you can tell the shit
You love me, I’m benevolent, cross me, it’s malevolence
Your bitch bad, but mine better, bitch, put a pussy up, we could settle it
I ride slow and I sit low, hat cocked and my gun too
Wit' my Levis and my Jordan 5s, white Tee, that's how Bun do
Only roll with one crew, one side, one town
That’s PA, and that’s all day, sun up ‘til the sun down
Pimp City, Bun Town, live for it and die too
Don’t disrespect when I slide through or them trill niggas'll slide you
I’m from the south, I’m a southern nigga, corn bread in the oven, nigga
Big woman give me lovin’, cousin, you can hate it or love it nigga

With diamonds against the woodgrain

Comin' down, candy red Deville, can’t break me off, nigga, bet a mil’
Don't try me, hoe, you already know if you ever think about approachin' me
I’m self-made, self-paid, can't no nigga say he was coachin' me
And I don’t know what they told you, but fuck with me and I’ll fold you
I’m not the one, neither hands or gun, step to Bun, that’s a bold move
I’m cold, nigga, pick either pole, nigga, I’m the equivalent, I’ll hurt your soul nigga
Them lies that you told, nigga, I’m really livin’ the ignorance
Straight up out of them backwoods, deep south, dirt roads
Trill niggas that’ll hurt hoes, play pussy, get your skirt rosed
Now you exposed and it’s plain as day, that’s the price of them games you play
All them lies is about to rise, it's some shit you just can’t explain away
Rep-Representin' that south, nigga, gold teeth in my mouth, nigga
Pray to God, but I’ll pull your card, so don't make me run up in yo house, nigga

Talkin’ about  let the clip sing, get the metal to your mouth like a lip ring
Got even ‘cause I beat the odds, no hands, just dick when I beat your broad
Lookin’ for a super head on Columbus shore, from the glass to the floor when I stomp the yard
Fifty blue Ben Franks just to paint the toy, sittin’ on Vogues like a toilet seat
H-Town nigga, with a Georgia peach, pockets on fat, but I hardly eat
Ain’t ‘bout money, then I hardly speak, still sell chicken, but avoid the beef
Bang, bang, bang, wit' a Ruger piece, bring it to your door like Uber Eats
King not 'Bron, nigga, I am the man
AT&T, nigga, I’m in demand
CIC, nigga, I’m in command
Barrack, no drummer, gold Rollie on my hand
Paid the same price with the brick go
She a green light, yeah, your bitch go
On your hoe molars where the dick go
Keep it one hundred, you a misroll
I’m 6 feet, standin’ on my sack, I’m 6-4
Sweet James Jones, I’m Pimp C
Church on Sunday, on ya bitch row
Sippin’ on oil, no Crisco
Smokin’ on gas, out in Frisco
Burner on deck when I move nigga
Quick as diarrhea, let the shit go

Came up out the mud, I was 'posed to rot
Then I switched it up, started snappin' like a photo op'
Terminator, Robocop, elevate the muscle car
Got a foreign broad just to match with the foreign car (foreign car)

Trap hands, hallelujah
I run this shit, Rick The Ruler
I'm gettin' bitches, stackin' mula
Trap hands, hallelujah

Keep It 100,II Trill,2008.0,"Chop's on the track

""Keep it 100"" All day and all night
Nigga, any time you see me I'mma keep it super tight
I'm an Underground King, repping UGK
Don't give a damn what a motherfucker say, I'mma keep it...
""Keep it 100"" All night and all day
Nigga, any time you see me mayne I'm reppin PA
This is UGK for life, long live Pimp C
And I'mma never let a nigga pimp me, I'mma keep it...
""Keep it 100""

Cause it's all that I've ever known
All that I've ever been, all that I've ever shown
Get your shit together clone, build a better prototype
You lookin like a mop (mop), and I'm lookin for a flo' to wipe
I heard your album mayne if that's what you call it
Another gangster fairytale and for that shit we ain't fallin
All you're talkin bout it is slangin, bangin, bussin and ballin
But I ain't seen yo scary ass at All Star in New Orleans (All Star at New Orleans nigga)
I'm tired mayne this shit is gettin older than Moses
Pussy niggas always poutin with poses
But mayne all it really shows is how hard you ain't
A nigga bust yo ass in the mouth, you probably faint
Not from the power of the punch but the shock (but the shock)
Cause you a coward and niggas gon' devour your lunch
A bunch of niggas done tried (tried) but ain't too many done it like me
It's Bun B'der, a G, and I'mma keep it 100


Cause that's exactly what the trill do
Ain't nobody tellin me what I won't or I will do
If I don't feel you, you lucky that I don't kill you
Leave you leakin till you moult in your meal dude, for real dude
I got the skill to, don't make me have to show it
Cause it'll be over before you know it
You get one shot and I suggest you don't blow it
If I do it, I overdo it, reap that you gon' sew it (you reap that you gon' sew it)
I'm a revolutionary black fister
You fuckin with fire, fuck around and get a blister
I fuck with a father, then fuck around and hit a sister
Underground King motherfucker, call me Mister (Mister what?)
Kilogram, Mister Woodgrain, Mister Brick (brick)
And unless you the misses, get of the mister dick (dick)
Cause this the shit that have these motherfuckers runnin for the hills
From the King of the Trill, cause I keep it 100


Cause nowadays motherfuckers lie (lie)
Some to your face, some can't even look you in the eye (eye)
Some in this place, some just left and some is comin by (by)
A little later (later) probably a little hater (hater)
And they gon' still debate us (bate us) try to prove they the greatest
And they still gon' be wronger than fuck, so holler later
I'm leavin, I'm not a waiter (waiter), but I'll end up servin you
They try to step up to the likes of me, why the nerve of you (the nerve of you)
Well I never and I do declare
I'm bout to fuck the game up so it's best you prepare (best you prepare)
Put on your fear cause I finna be spittin (finna be spittin)

Cause youse a pussy and yo partner is kittens

Get your toilet paper nigga cause I finna be shittin

II Trill,II Trill,2008.0,"Awww yeah..what's up pimp I feel ya prescence right now
Yo bun. you know many are called but few are chosen
You the chosen one my nigga the future president congratulations
By the way I need you to send a trill message to some
And a subliminal message to others about this throwin' rocks and
Then hidin' ya hand bitch. please let em know we gon give them what
They ask for

Mayne I'm too hard for all you soft niggas
Too real for most of you lames
Too raw to be in this rap shit and the streets is the same
Too throwed off in this game too true to my hood
I'm too down to get down so lets get it understood
Too bad to be good too golden not glisten
Too focused for fuck boys to fuck off my mission
Too smart not to listen when g's pull my coat
Bout them white folks that's listenin and watchin' my boat
That's real shit you can quote I'm too gangsta too street
So don't run up too fast cuz I'm too strapped with that heat
I'm too dirty to be me too gorilla to be monkey
Too fly to stay grounded too fresh to be funky
Too many licks for junkies, too much work for flippers
Too much dro for smokers, too much amp for dippers
No need for you to trip cuz we bring to much drama
Got too many killas put that on my mamma
I'm too trill

Iiiiii'm too trill, too, too too real
All about my dolla bills and even if I tried
I could never fall off too much money on my mind
IiiiiI'm too trill too, too, too, real
Hard as penetentiary steel it's simple and plain
If I retired you young'uns wouldn't know what to do with the game

And I'm too serious for this play playin' it's too much bread to make
For me too fuck of my time with these cats that's too fake
I done seen too many wakes, sent too many to them
Yo homeboy can get it I'm to ready to do him
Too many guns I can pull, too many slugs I can bust
Leave yo brain matter, bone fragments, and dick up in the dust
Too many niggas I done crushed to let yo bitch ass come try me
That smart game got gun play youll be screamin' why me
Too close don't get by me, you too prone to tell
Bout these bodies we catchin', this dope that we sell
You too weak ,mayne too frail, too light up in yo britches
You too much dick ridin' manye you worse than these bitches
Too many snitches that you breakin' bread wit
You too close to police ,boy you on some fed shit
So you can go head with that sale, we won't' buy
I'm too smart for all that dumb shit you know but boys try


And I'm too sick of all this sweet shit cuz I'm seein' too much smilin'
Too much punk ass posin' too much punk ass profilin'
Too many niggas be frontin' like they got the town on lock
With too much money in the bank and too many hoes is on they jock
But you smoke too many of them rocks that you claimin' you done sold
I done been out on them blocks and you ain't got too much control
Man you workers ain't that cold, they some hoes more or lesser
And they too ready to fold cuz they can't take too much pressure
Do we mash on them? yes sir they in violation go get em
It won't be too long befo we mop up the flo with em
It's rap-a-lot for life we done been here too long
To let these hata's bring us down we too right they too wrong
I'm too black and too strong to go out like a punk
Too ready for the ruckus too close too my trunk
We can pop or we can jump we can blast or we can go
From the shoulders bitch I tried to told you but if you ain't kno
I'm II Trill",https://genius.com/Bun-b-ii-trill-lyrics

All this lame shit been, been outta season
Practice what you preach, keep your eyes on the prize
Pop, pop the trunk twice with the swangers on the side
Drop the top, chop the block for no reason

Mane, I'm a big body in a big body, prop the fuck up
Top dropped the fuck down and trunk popped the fuck up
Love you if you stayed down and fuck you if you stuck up
Shit, I'm 'bout to drop the slab off and pick the truck up
Laid up in the Escalade, cup of Vodka
Un-DS Jordans I just pulled up out the locker
Nina tucked with the chopper and if I pop her
You couldn't stop her, break you off somethin' proper
Been 'round since Vogue tires wrapped around the Tru's rim
Tell them hoes if they ain't chose yet, they better choose him
Keep the camera movin', if you don't, you finna lose him
Better check the timeline if you ain't heard the news, bitch

Dirty South nigga, buck at me I'm finna buck back
Boys thought I wasn't comin' back, nigga fuck that
Shit, I'm 'bout to pick the slab up and bring the truck back
Slab time, wreck your slab, I'm about to hit 'em hard
Swingin' on your curb, best to get up in your yard
Say exactly what the fuck I feel with no disregard
David Blaine with this thang, mane, is this your card?
This the trill niggas, 409 region
You gon' have to back the fuck down or pay allegiance
Momma them from Louisiana, Cajun with the seasonin'
The King is on the throne, it's best you just appease him, bitch!

Practice what you preach, keep your eyes on the prize
Pop the trunk twice with the swangers on the side
Drop the top, chop the block for no reason

Summertime let the top off, spring up with the ice in winter
Chop the block like a steak dinner, they bust shots, return to sender
Graduated as a corner bender from the school of trill, showin' grill
Pop, pop the seal, pop, pop the trunk, neon read, ""Bitch how it feel?""
How it taste? Kringle season all in her face
Eat the cake, don't forget to scrap crumbs off the plate, them candy flakes
Drip off the chrome, sunshine won't leave me alone
'Cause I keep a glow, when they throw a stone
When it rains on my Vogues, 
and I swang and I tip slow

Practice what I always preach
No hand-outs, bitch stop that reach
I'm still holdin' on, competitin'

I guess I just assumed we had more time
For us to make more music (music) and write more rhymes (rhymes)
But never in my life could I ever have seen
That I would ever have to lose the other half of my team (for real)
You take away the glitter, the gold and the gleam
Say man I wonder to myself what does it all really mean
Nothin without the people you love
Say man I miss my brother, but I know he's lookin down from above

There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh
There's an angel in the sky watchin over me
Watchin over me yeahhhh, ooh-ooh-oooooh

Makin beats and puttin paper to pen
We was determined to win, and you couldn't tell us different

It seems just like yesterday sometimes
Sittin in ya bedroom (huh) writin dumb rhymes (man)
You makin beats on the insonic (sonic)
And we was smokin dirt weed cause it wasn't no chronic (wasn't no chronic)

To the G to the K, Underground Kings, DJ Byrd
Pimp C and Bun B, we kept it G, say word (say word)

...you know, yeah already. That's what it's really about but uh all this old shit here. If I wasn't rappin' I'd still be doin' this old shit here, you know? This ain't nothin' but materialistic, you know? Knowledge is power. I'm about makin' some money man, you know? Let's put this shit together, get some real paper.""

I been a real street nigga way longer than I remember
Grindin' on the block from January to December
I been in this game damn near since it began
With nothin' but reputation and skills with my hands (hands)
Know a whole 'lotta fools started when I did
Known for bein' fuck boys, pullin' some sly shit
Shoulda got laid out but somehow slid through
Extensions and bitches, nigga, I do not kid you (kid you)
Hit the highway with that work and got jammed up
Either tell on somebody or get you ten, slammed up
He ain't got the heart for it, so guess what he do?
He start recordin' for that part, mane, and tell on his crew
He was the boss of the operation, livin' it large (large)
Now he tellin' on the workers like they ass was in charge (charge)
Soon as the pressure's applied, you immediately switch (switch)
Man, just do us all a favor and stop bein' a bitch
You a bitch!

""As far as the police was concerned, I had some problems with some laws, now. You know? I run into wrecks with laws that didn't like what I stood for or didn't like rap music or just didn't like black folks in general. Man, the Lord was lookin' after me this whole time. Every time there was one that was dangerous that could get me, I had five or six that was on my side that kept that... kept that motherfucker in check, man.""

I know a'lotta people locked up, sittin' in cells (cells)
Either for shit that they did or shit they didn't do well (well)
But for every cat that's locked up, definitely guilty (guilty)
There's another brother innocent in prison, you feel me? (feel me?)
See this country we live in is really all about the bottom line
And when they see these young black men, they see dollar signs
So prisons go from bein' run by the state
To a private industry, nigga, tell me, can you relate?
See when education in the schools is geared for the testin'
They can't keep up the fundin' 'cause kids can't keep up the lesson
They get frustrated with the process and head to the streets
And find some alternative ways to get 'em somethin' to eat
You got draconian laws in place that's mandated by the state
Probation terms you can't meet so you know you gon' violate
Now you makin' license plates, scratchin' the ten year itch
Your prison an industrial complex, man, stop bein' a bitch
You a bitch!

""You see a lotta people in the penitentiary make statements like, ""I ain't never comin' back here,"" you know? And I made statements when I was on the street that I was never goin'. So, I don't say never anymore. You don't know what, you don't know what's in store. What I will say is this, ""I'ma stay positive out here. I'ma do the right thing."" You know, I'm not gonna, uh, make no moves to put myself in the crosshairs where these people can just cross me out and .""

This niggas told me he sold dope, I said ""what do that mean?""
He said ""I sell you some white or I could sell you some green"" (green)
Gotta pocket full of pills and a cup of that lean (lean)
Man, I'm just keepin' it trill, I slap the hat off his bean (bean)
You niggas kill me runnin' 'round, talkin' 'bout you sell drugs (drugs)
Moved a couple quarter pounds now you swear you the plug? (plug)
Oh, my bad, you got them birds that fly away every month (month)
You keep them kis? Nigga please, why you tryna' front? (front)
See you can have all the coca leaves that they grow in Columbia
Then serve up all the snorters and the smokers and numb 'em up
With stacks up to the ceilin', 
big doggin' like you Marmaduke
Still won't see a tenth of the paper that big Pharma do
They don't care about the cure, they just wanna sell a treatment
Keep you alive while keepin' you high, now that's some street shit
Usin' people's pain for profit, gettin' rich
Hey yo, pharmaceutical companies, stop bein' a bitch
'Cause you a bitch!

""But, but at the same time, I ain't gon' let nobody hurt me. I'm not gon' let nobody hurt my family and I will kill you if you come around my kids with that bullshit.""",https://genius.com/Bun-b-u-a-bitch-lyrics

European, Cape Verdean, Creole or Cajun
Domestic, international, even cosmopolitan
College girls, housewives, workin or you modellin (hold up)
I'm lovin all shapes, all colors, all sizes (sizes)
In the dark or in the broad day with no surprises (prizes)
I got a suite that's on reserve at the telly (telly)
Ready, willin and waitin so just hit me on my celly (celly)
It's goin down


Oh, Candi Redd!
2 A.M. and we gon' get it in, afterparty we gon' kick it off
Put your favorite dessert all over my body and let you li-lick it off
I'mma light these Roman therapy candles and grind slow while undressin
Move yo' way in this lingerie baby, come open yo' present
Up and down like a light switch, I ain't Just Brittany but it make me sing
I'm all over that night stick, keep beatin it up like I'm Rodney King
From behind with a tight grip, go on 'head boy do yo' thing
Tryin to let you hit it with that flex when you on yo' way to see me with that text

I bet the neighbors know his name the way he beat it out the frame
Surreal ride it like an 8-0-8, that sex good, he know it's great
I work them hips, I work that face, throw it back and he daddy stroke
Put whip cream on that kitty cat, eat it up and it purr back
Pull my hair, arch my back, forget them clothes, throw 'em on the flo'
He grip my thighs I'm goin live; Miss Aquafina, he know I'm wild
What he do? Just text me, you wanna freak me? Just Tweet me
Hit the flex when you sext me; I'm on my way so he can sex me


I'm a sexting, model
Lookin like lemonade in a Coke bottle, 'llac with my left eye's followed
So boulders try to hit on me harder than Drago
W-T-F O-M-G; semi-colon parenthesis
T-T-Y-L on the screen (uh-huh)
Your girls'll say kick on the touch screen
Smart Phones, sleek, my presence make him hurry (uh-ha)
So they all wanna talk sweet to my +BlackBerry+

I'm in my wife beater, +Boy Shorts+, laid back, comfortable
H-2-O, not RFL; flow so incredible
Candy sweet, edible, fo' G, digital
Tell me what you need but please don't call, gotta sell it back good, hands on
Rollin on kush, roll thin, they appetite large, V-12 engine
Scorpio, I handle my business, no tip but I stole what I finish
Roll like thick I got that holla back, make her wanna follow that
Look daddy, no hands - can you handle that?

Totin K's and holdin macs (macs)

Blood On the Dash,Return of the Trill,2018.0,"[Chorus: Gary Clark Jr. &

]
I think there's blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh
I think there's blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh

Late night in the Caddy, just rollin' through the hood
Known to act bad, but tonight it's all good
Just picked up a Michael Vick of that dro
Can't wait to get to the crib so I can blow
Half a mile away from the house, I hit Valero
Grab a couple packs of some 'rillos and a Modelo
Roll one up and throw the 'bacco out the window
Pull out of the parkin' lot and fire up the indo
Inhale, goddamn, big puffs of smoke
Exhale, now it's time to take another toke
But in the rearview, man, I can see me some headlights
Next thing you know, the fuckin' blue and the red lights
These streets never have police patrollin' em
When they supposed to, 
now I'm lookin' for the Ozium
Tryna stash the weed somewhere he can't see
That's when I realized that I got my pistol on me
Goddamn
[Chorus: Gary Clark Jr. & 
Bun B

There might be blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh
There might be blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh

Yeah, yeah
Officer man, I'm a part of the police force
But I don't walk or beat or ride on a police horse
In my patrol car late night ridin'
Workin' in the same community that I reside in
I saw the pain in the city and couldn't stand it
Crimes committed and no one was reprimanded
The conditions in my city was gettin' bad
So I hit the academy and walked away with a badge
I need to piss so I stop at the Valero
I see a guy buyin' some Swishers and a Modelo
Please don't light it up 'til you're home, that's what I'm hopin'
That's when I see him dump his tobacco and start smokin'
I pull up right behind him and hit the light
If he admit he got some weed I'ma let him make it tonight
As long as there's no warrants and he's legal in the streets
That's when I see him reach under his mothafuckin' seat, goddamn
[Chorus: Gary Clark Jr. & 
Bun B

I see the blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh
I see the blood on the dashboard of this old school
Digi dash, and the fishbowl glass, make the heavens laugh

I pull over to the side tryna stay calm
Whole car smellin' like fire, straight napalm
I know my gun ain't got no bodies
Got haters up off me but ain't shot nobody
Should I tell him I'm packin' but ain't got no 'plex?
Or just let him find that ho and wait and see what's next
What if he's a killer cop like I've seen on the news?
Should I shoot his ass first? Goddamn, I'm confused

Okay I checked his plates and they came back clean
But I still better call some backup to the scene
I don't know what he was reachin' for so I'm feelin' nauseous
I just wanna make it home so I'm tryna be cautious
Got a couple of arrests, but ain't no convictions
Get out the squad car and my adrenaline kicks in
So not knowin' if he's committed any prior harm
I walk up to his car with my hand on my firearm",https://genius.com/Bun-b-blood-on-the-dash-lyrics

So we don't never have a problem about bringin it back
Nope, she don't back-talk me when we up in the 'Llac
Cause she know it ain't nothin for me to give her a smack (what'chu need?)
I need a bitch that'll get up on a plane
Put it up in the pussy and come back on a train (when did she trip out?)
She don't want me to get after her mayne
Callin when she get somethin cause she know I ain't playin (it's official!)
I'm a pimp bitch, you know where the gun be
I'm ridin shotgun with $hort Dog and Bun B
This game doin time, but it be back
They got pussy on the market, where the G's at?


Biatch! On your mind
You can't hold back, now's the time
Jump in the car and go pick her up
Take her somewhere, so you could fuck
If you wanted to, you could knock her
All you gotta do, is take her shoppin
A lil' extra cash, for her pocket
Next thing you know, you'll be fuckin

I charge these hoes when they want some dick
I spit the game and they don't complain
Too $hort baby, that's my name
Real players need ladies, to have some fun

I'd give you one, but you gots to pay

So while there's still time left it ain't too late for you to grow up

Try'na hold onto  rope consciously
I know for sure the greatest shit in front of me
Inspiration for the ones that came after me
First to say I never did it all correctly
Fuck ups I made still won't let me
Sleep good when a nigga can't eat good
Shit I did back when everybody ate good
Playful, I was runnin' with the hateful
Instead of sittin' down, nigga, bein' grateful
Learn from it, take notes and earn with it
Feed families and don't waste your turn with it
Have fun with it, whatever come your way
And when it get real, young nigga, don't play

When I was young, I was crazy and wild (Crazy and wild)

'Cause you been fuckin' off with too much wrong for too damn long
It's time to show up (For real), so be a woman or a man and grow up

Now either you a rookie or you pro up
You tryna win the race or you out here tryna slow up
Drink up or throw up, let the air out or blow up
Travel, get outta your city, do some more stuff
Now before I ever go broke I'ma hoe up
That mean go get a hoe that's gon' help me get some dough up
A nigga get wrong, we gon' leave him ten toe up
So every time I needed her, she broke her neck to show up
Pimp tight, I mean I'm tryna life the most of
Life that I can live, zoom in and get a close up
Maybe I can be an inspiration to some more of
The people of the world make the whole world grow up
It's seems like for every other drink that I pour up
It's for a dead loved one and we don't even know what
For a lotta loose ends left to sew up
But God needed them, another angel had to go up

When I was young, I was crazy and wild (Crazy and wild)
But now I'm grown and not a god damn child (God damn child)

Bitch it's the king of the trill, I'm top of the line
My paint is on drip, my rims is on shine
My butter seats reclined, cherry oak is grip
With swisha sweets to blow, and purple rain to sip
Now straight up off the rip, I'm letting boys know
I've never been a bitch, don't plan to be a ho
So if you got some plex, you better keep it low
I bring it to your chest, soon as you hit the do'
You know me as a pro, respect me as a vet
I put it down befo', you ain't seen nothing yet
My candy still glossy, my 4's still flossy
My rocks real icey, I'm looking kinda bossy
And feeling real saucy, it's time to get it crunk
Now watch me pop it fly, just like I'm popping trunk
The leader of the pack, the star of the show
When Bun is in the building, you already know

I'm fresh (I'm fresh), brand new (brand new)

And only bad bitches say my name, ho

Bitch you wanna roll with a pimp, then have it on your mind

I gotta stay on shine, so you know what that means
You gotta hit that track, and bring me back that green
Cause daddy need his ice, and daddy need his chain
We gotta keep it G, so rec' him as the game
A ho need a pimp, a pimp need a ho
And tricks need us both, so let's go get that do'
In case you didn't know, I haven't been told
But pussy on the corner, and it's as good as sold
It's tricks on the prowl, so stay out on that stroll
Cause I'mma sell your cot, and you gon sell your soul
My pimping way too cold, but it's gon keep me warm
With minks up on my back, and rocks up in my charm
So bitch ring the alarm, and tell 'em I've arrived
The greatest ever born, that's dead or alive


Bitch you know that Rap-A-Lot's the click, and UGK's the fam
It's middle fingers up, cause we don't give a damn
Them Caddy do's slam, that top gon drop
Them 4's gon tip, them blades gon chop
Them deuces get chunked, them screens gon fall
It's Southside holding, so we gon ball
And slabs gon crawl, them 3's gon swang
That woman gon shine, that trunk go bang
And underground king, from P.A.T
I miss my dog, so free Pimp C
And I'mma hold it down, and rep for my team
To keep us on the map, so he can get that green
I work the triple beam, electronic scale
Even a baby bottle, whatever get that mail

If It Was Up II Me,II Trill,2008.0,"I hear we livin in the last days (days), it's revelation
And you best get right with God (God) or else Hell is waitin
The world is comin to an end, every day is a storm
Or a flood or tsunamis (damn), this shit ain't the norm
We've got Katrina and Rita, minds keep collapsing
With the fires and mud slides, I'm like ""what's happening?""
Got the kids in the school gettin raped and molested
Underfunded, under protected, no wonder they tested
In the lowest damn percentage rate (rate)
And my city is damn near the lowest in the state (state)
You can equate that to the state funds that ain't breakin down right
Rich districts get more and poor ones get less and it just don't sound right (nope)
So I'm fittin to pound right on the doors of my city hall
And kick them hoes down (down), they killin my city y'all
We need to get my people back to where they should be
And since nobody else gon' do it, it's gon' have to be me, mayne

If it was up to me
? the community
And if it was up to me
You could have ended the war between 2Pac and B.I.G
And if it was up to me
? China, ? Pimp C
If it was up to me
? HIV

First of all the projects is fucked up and it ain't just with the drugs
We got more problems than the dealers and thugs
They usin lead-based paint and asbestos is killin us
We tell them to fix it up but they just ain't feelin us
They rather kick us out and tear it down to the ground
So they can put up a parking lot, a mall or some condos
Condemn the whole place cause a few sell crack
Shit, the rest ain't do nothin wrong, what the fuck's up with that?
They say that one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch
But we talkin about some people not apples, this ain't lunch
Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face
You say you represent my district, get yo' ass on the case
""Development is good for the hood"", yeah that's what you tellin us
But bitch you on the payroll of the builders and developers
Fuck what you sellin us, pipe dreams for suckers
You can take that 'round the corner to them other motherfuckers, mayne

So much youth they sacrifice
Just to live in Paradise
Play they tricks and tell they lies (I know-ow)
It's sad to see how they treat the poor
Have so much and still want more
I see my people every day on the floor
 - w/ ad libs

It's time to educate the people mayne, free school and college
(college)
So everybody across the board can get the same knowledge
Education leads to jobs (jobs) and jobs kill poverty
And no more poverty means we makin money, obviously
Everybody gettin money, everybody smilin (smilin)
Motherfuckers ain't eatin, then motherfuckers wildin (wildin)
Matter fact speakin of eatin, let's feed the homeless in America
Let these other folks handle they own shit
How I'm a clean your house and mine still dirty? (dirty)
How I'm a feed yo' kids while mine sit thirsty? (thirsty)
And speakin of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em
Can't turn 'em loose in the streets (why?) cause they dyin in 'em (damn)
And all this naked head sex, man you trippin
Fuck love, I'm lovin life you ain't gon' catch ya boy slippin (slippin)
You say ya boy trippin, I'm just keepin it G
Cause you can see how good the world would be if it was up to me mayne

Sit down for a second, Mildred!
Mildred, get yo' goddamn feet off the table
(It's a Big E beat!) C'mon now, shit
This is, this is why we don't ever have nothin man
It's a good evenin here, Ceddy St. Louis
This right here about to bring to the stage
Is a gentleman from Port Arther, Texas
Real gentleman, real singer, real story teller
Real gangsta, a true veteran of the bid'ness
Y'all show him some love, talk to 'em Bun

Thank y'all for comin to see me this evenin (yeah)
Cookin this cajun I laced it with seasonin (huh)
In here, I been here and don't plan on leavin
The king of the trill's 'bout to pass, who's receivin?
I'm throwin, I'm throwed on, the mic I explode
Slow all that bangin mayne just like my load
Don't test me or stress me, I'm in that mode
Where I could just black out and leave yo' ass flo'ed
Benzes and Beamers I drove 'em and slabbed 'em
Big booty hoes I exposed 'em and grabbed 'em
Take 'em right out of they clothes and I have 'em
They pussy is golden (what) my dick is platinum
And hard as a diamond, I'm hard when I'm rhymin
I'm closer to God, like Eric B. I'm in
That get money frame of mind, any day and time
That's what this is and shit ain't no shame in mine

That's the thing about music:
Music is, in and of itself, the pure manifestation
Of what we got inside brought out to the outside:
Those things that we wanna say, but you can't say to everybody
You say when you're inside the studio
When you get 'em out n' they come out in a song;
The song gone gone come through the airwaves, and touch somebody...

Back on that bullshit so bring in the cattle
Ready for war so let's get to the battle
Niggas is babies with bottles and rattles
The street lights is on, it's your curfew, ske-daddle
That all you got G? You comin up short
You ain't got the muscle, you ain't got the heart
You need actin classes, you can't play the part
Yo' mind ain't on money you need to get smart
I'm known to spit darts that'll land in the center
Right in the red for the breadwinner in her
Stack in the summer, the ball in the winter
I'm grippin that wood (shit) just got a splinter
You's a beginner, a novice, a rookie
How you got bricks when you can't cop a cookie?
We after paper, you after the nookie
You bet against me and you lost, pay the bookie

Just gimme a second...gimme a second --
God dammit, Charlie, I'm not gonna say it again --
Make me have to pull my pistol out on here;
You know I don't play -- get up; somebody get him; get this little boy --
Now, this gentleman is a wordsmith, architect of words and design, storyteller --
He gonna give it to me right now:

Twista!
They can never run in my shoes
They know nothin 'bout the ones and the twos (nope)
Murder to the drums when I bruise
Twista killin them with Bun and the Blues (yup)
Competition better study harder
'Cause I feel like we done found another tune (tune)
They gon' try to to be like Muddy Waters
I'ma be the man howlin at the moon (arooo!)
Comin up and standin on my stack (stack)
A veteran but keep my lyrics dope (dope)
And you still listen out the ride (ride)
I ain't even got a car note (nope)
Y'all ain't snappin cause you wicked crushed
And I'mma get 'em, I could tell her (tell her)
Fall dash rapper when you tell 'em bust
He can even spit the a cappella ('pella)
He can even come right off the top (no)
He don't kill 'em even though he crumb (no)
He can only kill 'em in the studio
When somebody can help him make a song (yeah)
Ask me why I don't hear it, I told ya
It's nothin but bullshit lyrics in yo' folder (ha ha!)
On the blues we come colder, Bun B's a boa
Constrictor, Twista inflicts the pain of a cobra
Flame and I'mma show ya, the remains of a soldier
Down home blues killin niggas in the game, 'til it's over

It's music:
It's always forthcoming, forth-telling, you know -
Ain't none of that bullshit, skippity doppity doo wop bop de bop
He talkin' bout some real shit --
Ain't he talkin bout some real shit?
Jay! Haven't y'all heard Bun B? Can't he rhyme? that motherfucker can rhyme, can't he?

The Legendary DJ Screw,Trill OG: The Epilogue,2013.0,"This is dedicated, to the legendary
DJ Screw

Now once upon a time not long ago
Where they come down candy, and live life low
Where the fours stay chromey, and they grippin' on wood
And people all behave like it's all to the good
Then came a young player from the Southside streets
Who had dreams of making music, with slowed down beats
He jumped on the tables made it do what it do
And so begins the legend of DJ Screw

(Scratched) This is dedicated to the legendary DJ Screw

Jeah
Six in the morning, Feds at my door
Quarter mil' on the floor, the city where everything shows
Yeah, still bang Screw, we love it mayne
I know he gone, but nothing changed
Hawk, P.A.T., M.O.E. they all above us, mayne
Down here he grind and hustle, mayne
Can't forget Chad Butler mayne
Still swang on 84's, a mirror-glass like buzzers mayne
Grab the Louie duffle man, S.U.C. still in this thing
I know my dog gone, Robert Davis, we gon' do it mayne

See, I love this life
This is Screwed Up Click
Don't quote me, dog
You'll get screwed up quick
Still we blew one quick
My 84's, they stick
On 24's, we sit
You know we holdin' it, bitch
I'mma do this hit for Screw
For Hawk, for Pat
Even though we pushin' powder
But the trunk, be crack
C-Note reppin' S.U.C
R.I.P. to Jimmy T
Nigga, I'mma swang in the 'Lac
That's how it s'posed, to be


(Jeah)
One of the realest to do this shit
Used to Texas Screwed up, quick
Yeah, the tracks, Screw'll bring it back
No one better that you can get
For my nigga Robert Davis
Chop it up, Screw my shit
Now the true representation, making sure the world knew this shit
Every time you think of double cups, or swangers peekin' out the boards
Freestylin' off top of dome, or grills covered in ice and gold
Dealers salute the General, point-black, no subliminal
Tell 'em we Screwed up Texas, we go fed like a criminal

Here's a little story about a nigga like me
Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, nigga, S.U.C
South-west, H-Town, all of that's me
If a ho is cotton-mouth I wouldn't give a bitch P
I'm so Screwed up nigga say I talk slow
I say I listen fast when you niggas talk doe
And nah, I can't touch if the shit is not dro
If the drink is not purple, and the bitches no -whoa-


Dark blue Regal, or a Screw Blue Impala
Helpin' everybody, that's what he used to with this dollars
No collars, just t-shirts and Dickies
Even though he had a lot to do
He was never too busy to come and get me
I'm really Screwed Up Click, Robert Earl Davis put me in
Not a friend of a friend of a friend, of a friend
I can see him spinnin' records in Heaven in all white
Like he used to do on 22-34 all night

Niggas I feel that's talkin' shit
Niggas I feel that's ridin' dick
Talkin' down on the Screwed Up Click
They must don't know who they fuckin' wit'
5-Star General of the S.U.C
Want my clique, gotta go through me
Go through Key, and Mike. D
Then you gotta go through Big Pokey
Who you know a nigga hard as me?
Who you nigga know is smart as me?
Niggas wanna know how hard is he
I'm hard as the Baltimore Raven's D
Betcha ain't see, like a  real
Hardest nigga I feel, with no deal
Plowin' through niggas like a snowmobile
And I make beats that the real can feel",https://genius.com/Bun-b-the-legendary-dj-screw-lyrics
Crush City,UnKnown,2015.0,"Yo wassup, this is Trill OG out the 409. Bun B, you know I rep UGK for life. 
But it's October and the Houston Astros is in the playoffs, baby.
 We in the postseason and it's about to go down. So if you got love for the Houston Astros like the Trill OG got love for the Houston Astros, and you rocking your orange and your blue, you know what it's time to do. Put your H's up in the air baby, let's go!

Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your H's in the air if you with it man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your H's in the air if you with it man

It's the Houston Astros and we back in
Won the Wild Card, sent the Yankees packing
Yeah, now the Astros are in the playoffs
If you thought we wouldn't make it you was way off
This the payoff, playing in October
If you up against us then it's over
Talking down we don't listen to what you say
We keep it 200 like the hits from Altuve
H-Town you don't want it down here
We got Carlos Correa, he's the Rookie of the Year
With Keuchel on the mound, backed up by Tony Sipp
Not to mention Evan Gattis and Conger, don't trip
With Rasmus, Gomez, and Springer on deck
Chris Carter and Luis Valbuena, it's gon' wreck
So show us some respect, we came to lay the muscle down
Turning up in Club Astros for Hustletown

Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your H's in the air if you with it man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Crush City man, Crush-Crush City man
Now put your H's in the air if you with it man

Postseason, we done made it to the first round
Headed to Kansas City to put the hurt down
And ain't nobody down here scared of KC
So if you think we won't win then you crazy
The Astros are in the zone
Plus you know Dallas Keuchel ain't losing at home
So I think it's fair to warn you
That I'ma have my beard and my red tee on in Keuchel's Korner
We  and we almost there bro
So hey Colby, don't dry your hair bro
And believe me, it's really no love lost
When Gattis knock it out the park with his gloves off
Now that's old school just like me
Headed to the World Series, we just might be
But we gon' take it one game at a time
Never fold under pressure when game's on the line
Hold it down",https://genius.com/Bun-b-crush-city-lyrics
Retaliation Is a Must,Trill,2005.0,"Hold up, middle fingers up
Pussy-ass niggas down nigga (muh'fuckers)
H-Town, Texas stand up, Southwest (uh-huh)
Sunny side, P.A. we up in here
Bun, holla at these motherfuckers (you know'm talkin 'bout?)

Say, nigga you can't run, nigga you can't hide
Know that we got guns, know that we gon' ride
Blow out your insides, and leave ya to rot
Cause when we give it to ya bitch we give you all that we got
Now all it take is one shot to put yo' ass in a ditch
But you gon' get the other forty-nine for bein a bitch
Go to war with the big man when it makes no sense to
Repercussions get extreme when we ride against you
Ain't no movin ya baby mama {?} or your kids
Everybody finna get it for the shit that you did
So when I get to ya crib, better come out swingin
Cause the devil ain't even ready for this hell I'm bringin
We don't want no dope, we don't want no cash
We don't want no excuses, we just want yo' ass
So when that front do' crash, and you see them soldiers
When that gun go flash, don't say that Bun ain't told ya, nigga

If I pull it I'mma pop and be the first one to bust
We ain't playin wit'chu hoes (retaliation is a must)
First nigga make a move, first nigga hit the dust
We ain't playin wit'chu hoes (retaliation is a must)

Yeah, now I stand on my two feet, one clip, two heats
20-shot hollow heads, bitch give me the loose leaf
Fuck beef, I got a K for niggas
In spots the laws won't find ya for days, my nigga
Southside, young playa full of plots and scams
Show ya how to get ya ovals up and lock the grams
Boys know me in the hood, but not from rappin
Back street trappin, front line, ya boy is a captain
First nigga to shoot, I ain't tryin to talk
Bring the heat to the hospital and finish you off
No life is a tunnel, while I'm rollin with my gun up
Don't get ya bitch gun butt, nigga what'chu want what
It ain't shit to get yo' family touched
Catch a T on the bus and pop a ass like a clutch, nigga
I'm in the game cause I love the rush
Love the bucks, this fans money never enough, nigga


Uh, hol' up, uhh
Forty-five in the Rover, the K is on my shoulder
Pop yo' bitch-ass, then I go and smoke it over
Niggas gettin older, but thugs is comin younger
So just in case you wonder I keep a F in the thunder
Nigga you's a blunder, got rocked by the thunder
Cryin to that Bun, but he the reason that we done ya
Gave us the word, said we keep the birds
Beefin is for nerds, I put ya brains on the curb

Fucka! Pull ya piece nigga, and watch you rest in it
Come to this clip game, bitch I'm the best in it
Your white flag ya wavin, now it's on, bitch please
All your loved ones houses lookin like swiss cheese
Tried to let ya ass make it, but ya ass act a fool
Now the H.K., the A.K., and the A-R is the tools
All ya homeboys gone and them hoes want less
So tell ya mom and ya sister break out the black dress",https://genius.com/Bun-b-retaliation-is-a-must-lyrics

Bun B, UGK sho nuff ladies and gentlemen

Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)

Before I jump up out my silk sheets, and hop off in the shower
It's already understood, I got the money and the power
I grab the baby powder, under shirt and white tee
My Dickies, fitted cap and white one's that's me
A hundred karats worth of rocks, courtesy of Johnny
I roll a couple blunts, and load up the Tommy
Ready to get my stunt on, my pockets on swoll
Now all I gotta do, is see which car I'm finna roll
Now I can take the Benz, or I can take the Rover
And if I pull the Bentley Coupe out, then it's over
But I'mma keep it O-G, and pull out the slab
So I can sit on buck, and have some wood grain to grab
Last but not least, before I pull out on the scene
You know I gotta po' me up, my oily cup of lean
I've been stacking all this green, now it's time for some spending
I've been cool about this grinding, but ain't no mo' pretending


Now if you see me in the shopping center, walking down the hall
It's already understood, that I'm buying out the mall
I got six homies with me, and at least two freaks
Man we looking for the Louis, and the Gucci boutiques
I keep the flyest footwear, and the newest Locs
And if I get some'ing for me, I'm getting some'ing for my folks
Cause we all gon be fitted up, we all popping tags
We all walking out of this mall, with big bags
And I ain't gotta brag, you can see it for yourself
I got ballers on my right side, and ballers on my left
We ain't from the same hoods, but it's all to the good
We bout getting this money, like some real G's should
And we ain't knocking nobody's hustle, why plex man
You only hate on yourself, when you hating on the next man
You can't be like Bun B, so why try to
Get your own bread, and you can ball just like I do


Before I pull up to the valet, and hop out of the car
It's already understood, that we buying out the bar
It's a line around the corner, people trying to get inside
But a playa like myself, is finna walk right by it
Now move the velvet rope, and keep the scanner
You don't wanna see us angry, like we David Banner
2000 and 5, Tony Montana haters
Ain't no need for you to knock us, just congratulate us
We done made it out the ghetto, by staying on the grind
We focused on the paper chase, with money on our mind
Now we just wanna shine, buy some bottles and pop em
So if you see niggas out there, playa hating then stop em
Cause we don't really wanna have, to bust a motherfucker's head
We just wanna holla at bad bitches, and spend this bread
We buying everybody drinks, and making it rain
Cause I'mma rep, like a motherfucking underground king",https://genius.com/Bun-b-im-ballin-lyrics

Hey, Mr. Preacher Man, what do you say?
See you out here tryin to save yourself some people today
You got the good book in your hand and the robe on your back
Steppin out your 2008 Escalade Cadillac
You standin up in the pulpit, lookin out at the pew
Preachin the good word and tellin Christian folks what to do
You talkin 'bout the sinners are sinnin, but let's keep it true
Ain't nobody in this church a bigger sinner than you
It's chapter this, verse that, pass the plate, pay your tithes
Puttin rings on your fingers (fingers) and rims on your ride
You don't need yourself a thousand dollar suit, just to pray in
(Just to pray in) Or a million dollar house for you to stay in (nope)
Marriage counselin, but cheatin on ya own wife
Undercover pedophile, a heathen in ya own right
Let the do'knob hit ya where the good Lord split ya

The good book say, that he who is without sin cast the first stone
Mayne every time I walk inside the church house
The preacher cuttin his eyes at me
But I know he can't throw nothin my way
He dirtier than I am, ridin down the street shinin, ballin
Hollerin at broads, hollerin at dudes on the cool
That's why niggas don't go to church now
It ain't the message, it's the motherfuckin messenger

Hey, Mr. Policeman, what do you say?
I see you out here tryin to save yourself some people today
You got that nightstick in your hand and you walkin your beat
Or in the blue-and-white car and drivin down my street
You say you here to help the people, and do us some good
Protect us and serve, to try to keep the peace in our hood
Claim you crackin down on the crime, but let's keep it true
Cause the biggest criminals in my city is you
You know police brutality is at a all-time high (high)
Pumpin 61 slugs into an unarmed guy (guy)
Tried to say that the assailant had a motherfuckin handgun
But when you couldn't find one, you motherfuckers plant one
Rampart scandal, 2Pac Shakur
Christopher Wallace, it got me sick and who got the cure?
If the PD, went M.I.A., we wouldn't miss ya
Y'all some dirty motherfuckers (so) it's time to get'cha issue, c'mon

Look at this shit mayne
Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell, 2Pac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G
Motherfuckers is dyin out here man
And if the police ain't killin 'em
They not givin a fuck about who will
Nobody tryin to find out who killed these people
Fat Pat, Big H.A.W.K., this shit ain't right man
Good cop, bad cop, the line blurry every day
Let us move on

Hey, Mr. Politician, what do you say?
I see you out here tryin to save yourself some people today
You tellin us it's time for a change, people is dyin
And the current administration doin nothin but lyin
You come down to my community and tell us your goals
To clean the system up and get the crisis under control
Claimin you can get us on track, but let's keep it true
The main motherfuckers keepin us off track is you
Damn near everybody runnin is a member of the senate
They voted to send us to war, so y'all got us in it
Now the shit done hit the fan, and you tryin to say
You wasn't down from the jump but man the shit won't play
Y'all some liars, stealers, philanderers and all
Got senate to suck the dick inside of bathroom stalls
Nah, elected officials lettin the dick kiss you
You's a dirty motherfucker (so) it's time to get'cha issue, c'mon

Man, I don't believe this shit
Motherfuckers overseas die in that war
We just got rid of a president that didn't wanna do nothin
Sit back and got his dick sucked all day
Now we got motherfuckin elected people, in office
In motherfuckin airport bathroom tryin to suck
The dicks half the people on the beat and shit

Cause it's an underground thing
Cause I'm an underground king

No reprise for the cars
I'm staying up in the foreign
Wanna wake up my neighbors
And the other cooks in the morning
If being Bun wasn't touring
I swear the game would be boring
If being fake was a felony
All y'all rappers be starring in America's Most Wanted
I missed that Pimp and that Pac
So it seems that me and Bun B
Is the realest breed you got
My paper chase getting faster
I'm even beating the clock
When it comes to G's the tick tock
Is gonna get beat to the dock
I gave birth to the hustle
So let my fetus be shown
When I pull out them baby benjamins
And I skeet on your dome
I'm secreting the dough
So don't leave your woman alone
Or I'll turn my dick to a dollar
And give your woman a loan
My presence on Texas streets
Is something that's easy to spot
I'll assassinate concrete
For the G's I'm bleeding the block
Boys'll see me on swingers
And think it's easy to plot
But I bet them boys that's behind me
They gonna be beaming up scott
Hear me out

Can't knock the hustle man
Don't hate the player hate the game
Gotta love it man
Catch me flipping gripping grain in the turning lane
Trunk on bang
Cause it's an underground thing
Cause I'm an underground king
Can't knock the hustle man
Don't hate the player hate the game
Gotta love it man
Catch me flipping gripping grain in the turning lane
Trunk on bang
Cause it's an underground thing
Cause I'm an underground king",https://genius.com/Bun-b-underground-thang-lyrics
Trill,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Big terrible Texas
It's where legends are born
I'm Lil' Keke The Don
Original Screwed Up Click
It's a dedication to DJ Screw
Fat Pat, Big Mello, Big Steve
Feel it?

Draped up and dripped out, Know what I'm talking about
Draped up and dripped out, Know what I'm talking about
Draped up and dripped out, Know what I'm talking about
Draped up and dripped out, Know what I'm talking about

I'm draped up and dripped out, the truth has just slipped out
84's, Red Doors, Candy Apple Flip-Flop
Got them boppers dripped out cause my drop tip top
Purple Cup, Screw Us Up, that's what keep the streets hot
Don Ke, Bun B, Please Free Pimp C
Hydro, Super Flow, know these boys feeling me
Come to Houston, Texas and see swangaz and 'lacs
And don't forget to tell the people that the legends are back, yeah

It's Slim Thug showing H-Town love
Used to hit the club on dubs, acting bad on scrubs (thats right)
Mad spokes and leather, 24's or better
Boys say they riding candy but my load is wetter
The roads for compeitors when they see the two letters
They'll never ever ever ever ever get on my level (thats right)
Me and Bun together caked up with clout
Staying draped up and dripped out, know what I'm talking about?

The city is back, just look at the map, thought we wouldn't get in the game
I'm sticking my dick up in the game and bustin in that like a train
I'm hitting that mayne, look at this grain I'm grippin, I'm fixing to swang
My bumper doing the body rock and my trunk is doing the crane
Now who in the hell was able to tell the world it wasn't my bang
I turn up the beat and I'm cracking the street, the city we started to train
The world is looking like Texas mayne, just watch how they pick up the slang
Just show 'em your grill and pick up some drank and watch how they do the same, Hold up mayne

What it do baby, It's Paul Wall, Players rise while haters fall
Got Fo's crawling in the 54 on the service road, I'm obeying the laws
I stay shining like headlights and I stay crawling like head lice
Just like a boy but I play the dice, them twos and threes ain't nuttin nice
Them threes and fours I'mma roll fo sho, fo's and vogues, we call 'em swang
My partner Bun B bring the pain, Wanna know what I rep? Just check the chain
In the hood is where I hang, On South Lee, that 5-9
He dippin oil, He drippin candy, From P-A to H-Town, It goes down


I stay draped up, dripped out, Drop the top when I'm flipping out
Candy low on 84, (How you know they Fo's?) they poking out
Ice Age and Rap-A-Lot, Pimping hoes in the parking lot
Diamonds shining in my grill, you can see 'em if its dark or not
When I'm out in the limelight, I make sure I shine bright
I'm in the drop with the Glock cocked, you know I keep that iron tight
I'm getting brain from a tight dame on North Maine in the turning lane
I'm young and rich talking alot of shit, I guess its because I'm having thangs

We still draped up and dripped out; know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Fighting over parking spots, bustin' in the parking lot
Tu sabes; vatos, raised on tacos
Parence; se mato sin ningun contrato, vamos
Now put your blocks up; now put your sets up
And fuck that nigga over there, cause I think he's Esco
Aztek'll pull a clip out, and with the click out, don't give a shit 'bout
Til he gets out, Free Pimp C, we draped up and dripped out

I told Bun when you need a verse, just holla
You know how we do it, you don't gotta spend no dollars
I'm puffin dro, bangin screw, and riding fos
Middle fingers in the air, you know how it goes
Stash spot with weight in it, Candy paint with blakes in it
Trunk got the bass in it, One liter with eights in it
Swisha sweet with haze in it, you know I'm blowed
Four row diamond chain, you know I'm pro
Johnny got me right huh? 80 karats, bright huh?
Hit the button, pop the trunk, watch the neon light jump
I'mma keep folding bread til Pimp hold his head
We miss you DJ Screw, man I hate you dead

Down to ride red but I'mma ride blue in the turning lane looking just like Screw
300 Crissy, don't think they doors, Everybody know Z-Ro's flow is ferocious
I keep a ride with the daytons in the deck, Might be deep 22 drank in the whip
You can keep the sherm but you can pass the cup, My cadillac rolling on glass and wood
Would I knock a jacka down when his ass get up, Hell naw, this is playa from the chest to the nut
Screw was here he said I would come up now the radio requesting my stuff
Gotta keep a smif n wesson to buss cause the better life keep me stressing enough
Is this rap for real, is it a blessing or what?, Screw I hope I see you when they wet me up

This is H-Town, Texas, tell me how does it look?
Taking over the rap kitchen and we ready to cook
You can hear us whipping the beakers coming out of the speakers
Stepping up some fresh hard for you out of town peakers
We got 3rd Ward, 4th Ward, and Southside G's
Plus Southwest and Bloody Nickels rollin 83's
It's Houston, Texas motherfucker, you know the name
We'll see you in February for the All-Star Game

Snow Money,Trill OG,2010.0,"Say mayne, I had this pussy ass nigga come up to me the other day...
You know what I'm sayin?
Talkin 'bout ""say Bun B, Bun B you gon' rep for P-A on this album?""
I said ""you bitch ass nigga, I am P-A, who the fuck is you nigga?""
Know what I'm sayin?
Everybody know I rep for Port Arthur, Texas to the fullest
Who the fuck know you nigga?
Don't nobody know you but your mama ho ass nigga
Move around nigga...
I'm some on P-A shit, know what I'm talkin 'bout?

P-A trill nigga, I was born ready bro
Our here on the grind, rain or shine, for the Fetti bro
Work comin in and movin out with the steady flow
Boys out of line, pull the thing out, let it go
Always G'd out, blacked out, from my head to toe
And it ain't a question that I be out to get the dough
Call up my connect, get the powder in from Mexico
Late night, come across the border in the Chevy ho
Get it for the low, if you need a plug, let me know
I get it from him, you come to me for the petty coke
That's the way the cycle go around like a merry go
Round, put it down for my town, they already know
Every time I try to get away, I can't let it go
Plush lifestyle, fly cars and the pretty hoes (pretty hoes)
So play your distance by scenario (what's up?)
Load up the van, let's hit the highway, here we go (here we go)

We hit the road and get the snow money
Bring it home, take it to the mall, blow money
Hit the strip club, take it out, throw money
Then get back up on the road and get mo' money
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')

You know it's ""UGK 4 Life"" and I'm a ride for that
Disrespect the game and I can't let you slide for that
It don't really matter where ya people try to hide ya at
Cause I'm a find ya, pull up behind ya, apply the MAC
Milli on the really, +I'm a G+, bonafide for that
Talkin' down on the Underground, you get denied for that
Where I come from, lot of pussy niggas died for that (where?)
Port Arthur, Texas, I got a lot of pride for that (huh)
So when we hit the road, haters better hide your hat (why?)
We hittin' licks with them bricks and them ninety packs (damn)
I hit this over twenty bro, it ain't no lie to that
Sting 'em for 300K and now I got to ride it back (so what ya doin?)
I'm lookin' for the laws, where ya hidin' at? (I see 'em)
Pull me over, I'm the decoy, fly for that (let's go)
Oh yeah, I'll take the speeding ticket, where ya sign for that?
Cause the dope and money never in the car I'm ridin' at (ride it back)

We hit the road and get the snow money
Bring it home, take it to the mall, blow money
Hit the strip club, take it out, throw money
Then get back up on the road and get mo' money
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')

And now we back up in the hood, where we 'sposed to be
In the back, countin' up them stacks that we 'sposed to see
Pussy ass niggas (niggas), ain't even gettin' close to me (at all)
They know I'd have they mama prayin' with a rosary (for real)
And I'm a put another hole where they nose should be
If they ever think of the position of opposin' me (damn)
A couple rounds plus a thought that probably froze 'em
We gon' lay a nigga down cause we +Feenin like we Jodeci (hold up)
They on the streets talkin' 'bout that they exposin' me (what?)
Exposin' what? I'm a open book, close it G (close it)
You talkin' tough but we know you just posin' see
And I'm a leave 'em stiffer than a mannequin (with holes in he)
You ain't friends, then you foes with me
And we can go to war definitely nigga, not supposedly
I'm not your average, I'm the chosen G
And if your money ain't snow money, best to get it frozen G (cause we)

We hit the road and get the snow money
Bring it home, take it to the mall, blow money
Hit the strip club, take it out, throw money
Then get back up on the road and get mo' money
Mo' money, mo' money, money, mo' (mo')

All they listen to is Boosie, smokin' on a loosie
Their attitude is bad but their coochie real juicy
Got some hoes from the hood
 And they straight up out the trap
If you comin' at 'em wrong guaranteed they finna snap
They make their ass clap when they drop it to the floor
And they gon' bust it open (when?), soon as they hit the door
Got some hoes from the hood

Their kids need some school clothes and brand new shoes
So they gon' bounce that ass and try to make a nigga choose
Got some hoes from the hood
 And they all about the bread
So you gon' have to pay to get some pussy or some head
'Cause they don't fuck for free, unless it's their baby daddy
So you better drop them coins before she hops off in your Caddy
Got some hoes from the hood
 And they all about finnessin'
Take your money and your jewelry before you done undressin'
So you gon' learn a lesson and it's for your own good
They gon' catch you slippin' nigga, just like they should

Niggas know that I'm the hardest out since the peta mayne (mayne)
Hot doggin, yeah smoke dog comin out foggy
Lettin off at your toes, hi froggie (hi)
My third leg loggy and your bitch is a lumberjack
You'd of killed that ho if you knew what I'd done to that (to that)
She chopped my tree down, often if I slumber jack
Beggin me to call but shit I don't know where her number at (at all)
And on the cool, I ain't lookin for it either though
Or the bitch before her, no I ain't lookin for neither ho (naw)
It ain't like I really need her though
Once she drop to her knees and let me skeet it out, nigga she can go (go)
Lead her out like a blind man walkin

Keep ya weapon tucked, be ready to buck and knuckle up, whenever you steppin up
Takin it as your guns are just, the fact that leavin it less is crap

What I Represent (UGK),Trill,2005.0,"The, the underground
The, the underground, the, the underground...
The, the underground
The, the underground, the, the, the underground...

Now this one here for everybody out there off the top
This for the real slab-swangas whipping dubs and drops
For the real block huggers that's embracing the grind
And the three-time fellas that be facing some time
For them real deep boys that be baking and serving
And the real hood hustlas that be shaking and swerving
For the real cut-throwers putting work in on the average
And trill ass niggas living they life like a savage
A lot of niggas hold it down for they set
And when the work comes easy and when the game ain't ready
They really rep they're neighborhood good or bad
Niggas that really be on the block throwing signs and flags
Well I'm here to represent for all the gangstas and the thugs
And the underdog niggas that ain't getting no love
For a nigga trying' to make a weight for him and his crew
Just recognize I'm representing for you, and nigga that's on the true

I'm a sell my dope, I'ma bust my guns
I'ma fuck my hoes, I'ma stack my ones
What I represent? (The, the underground
The, the underground, the, the underground...)
I'ma smoke my good, I'ma sip my drank
I'ma grip my grain, I'ma drip my paint
What I represent? (The, the underground
The, the underground, the, the, the underground...)

Now everybody wanna act like they already got it made
With the houses, and the cars, and the bills all paid
Got a million in the bank, and two million in jewels
But on the cool, life ain't like that for a lot of these fools
Lot of people in this world coming up pretty hard
Raised in project apartments, with no front yard
Had to share their clothes and shoes with cousins and brothers
Never had they own shit, they had to share it with others
I wasn't born with a silver-spoon sticking out my grill
I was raised in the middle of the struggle on the real
Had some hard times in my life, trying to make ends meet
Not to mention, trying not to fall victim to the streets
Against the odds, a nigga made it out the game
But that don't mean that I'm gunna forget about from where I came
UGK ain't just a name; it's what a nigga is
I was there before I got in the biz, and nigga that's on the rizz


Now people always be around when you shining and balling
But they real hard to find when tough times come calling
You got money, doing good, and they be all in your face
Then disappear like Sue Storm soon as you catch a case
It's like clockwork homeboy, the shit never fails
Soon as they think the party's over, everybody bails
Could a sworn they was your friends when your world was on shine
But soon as you get some time, outta sight, outta mind
It's a shame that some real ass niggas took a fall
It's a shame how they treat you when you locked behind the wall
When your woman won't visit and your homie won't send you no flicks
Or come and see you, that's some cold ass shit
Well I miss my nigga, he was down for me
That's why I got the whole world screaming ""Free Pimp C""
And I'll be right here waiting when you touch back down
UGK we still holding the crown, kings of the underground

What do I see? Some pussy ass niggas starin at me
They got some big ass chains on with big ass rocks
A couple niggas standin behind em throwin up blocks
They claimin they whip pots, got the streets on lock
And they don't take no disrespect and keep their heats on cock
And if they punch you in your face then some teeth gon drop
Man I don't know where the fuck y'all thinkin that we from at
But you niggas is keystone cops, laurel and hearted
Little rascals tryna be big, just gon fuck up the party
Thinkin that cause you drink a couple of fortys and twist phillys (phillys)
That y'all is bout to take over the game, bitch really? (bitch really?)
You goin broke tryna slang that crack
And you only gon fight a nigga that ain't gon fight back

A sucker wit the semi, bet he run right when he hear me
His niggas masqueradin, faker than silicone
A bad apple in the bunch, now we figure your city foldin
Homie, I'm from street po, I know how to dish a clip at you
Wouldn't you? Break wit em, a webster's permission slip
Pimp said it best, these niggas transcript writers
Pathological liars, sad suckers, dick biters
It's Teflon biatch, knock you out them Reeboks
A cocaine key, but he only flipped three blocks
Blow your brain all over the ceiling like sheet rock
I bet he get to ya, take a fader to a T top
We hot, Rap-A-Lot and Maab, don't get shot hoe
Cappin at your show, don't even know what you got shot fo
And next show, you hoe ass niggas squarin some rocks
Get some money, move out the hood but don't take care of your block?

UGK tat on my heart, hopin Bun's enemies hearin this
Y'all ain't sellin nothin right (serious)
The only bricks y'all ever seen was your record sales and when you pass a construction site
These rhymes that I write, if you could bring em to life
They could go in a cage and fight and knock out Kimble Slice
I live by the gun, die by the gun
Just to get closer to heaven with Pimp C and Big Pun
This is Latin history in the making for trill title takings
Like taking the love of Bob Marley from a Jamaican
Y'all faking but for Bun B we will ride until our heart stops
The success make me smile like TV Tego and Bankrock
I catch you popping champagne, chop it to your brain
Just for thinking outside of the Bun like Taco Bell's campaign

I'ma take your funky breath like an asthmatic
Damn tragic how I got your momma shot before her damn casket
I ain't talkin head bussin, I'm just talking rap battlin
See that was a metaphor, but just in case you really want it
What you think the metal for? I hope you pussy niggas get the point
I don't care who point it out when my laser on a point
Rest in peace to Pimp C cause that nigga had a point
Point 1, rappers act gay and dress like it too
Point 2, niggas greedy and they never feed their crew
Point 3, niggas cower to these crackers like some hoes
But always talkin bout what they-a do after their shows
Point 4, just some shit I gotta get offa my chest
I ain't scared to battle him but he say that he the best

Plottin' on me for my stacks and man I'm never goin' back

Vengeance

Fill my heart
My emotional pain
Can you feel it?
Naw
Can you feel it?
If you haven't experienced that nature of life, it's gutter

I got this drama
Don't worry mama
'Cause I got the armor
On my back when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thing
Cock that back
You don't wanna be, gone
Another goner, gone
In the game, gone

In a grave, gone
Bendin' corners, gone
Finna bang, gone
Another Soldier, long gone

Shootin' up your corner make a sound like ""Swish""
But I low so ghat cause the chopper don't miss

No the chopper gon' hit
Bound to leave your dome split
Lose your bodily functions
Have me think you gon' shit
Mddl Fngz, strong click
Bun B, the strong spit
Put you 6 feet under
Why not have a long sit
Long walk, short pier
Mane have a long flip
Got the streets on lock
And got the yola on whip
Tell mama we comin' home so don't trip

If I Tee, don't worry 'about me
Mama I'm a G
I know how to handle niggas tryin' to come up on me
Tryin' to run up on me
Thinkin' you gon' try me
Shit in a bag
Drinkin' through a IV
So appreciate your breath
While you got some left
Your life's a bitch
They got permanent PMS
And my only fear of death is reincarnation
So it ain't shit for me to make you niggas ER patients
Another Soldier in the grave

I got this drama
Don't worry mama
'Cause I got the armor
On my back when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thing
Cock that back
You don't wanna be, gone
Another goner, gone
In the game, gone
Another Soldier, gone
In a grave, gone
Bendin' corners, gone
Finna bang, gone
Another Soldier, long gone
In the grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave, grave

2 9's 4 clips
Prayin' that you niggas trip
Lookin' for some trouble
Finna bust you niggas bubble
And I don't give a fuck about your happy meal mug
We can go toe to toe or trade these slugs
So catch a square nigga
And I won't budge
Don't plea bargain now, nigga save it for the judge
I might have you niggas lookin' like a strawberry Fanta
Did so much, done burned myself, retire my bandanna
Southwest got them soldiers
Some movin' doja
Some movin' X
But they mostly movin' yola
With guns in the holster
We never leave the toaster
Face could wind up on a rest in peace poster
Rest in peace? No sir
Pissin' on your graveside
Then get real nigga with it & go fuck your wife
So think twice
One for you & your mama life
Band I-T, shoot the soldiers like I shoot the dice

For my nigga Bad Ass Bam, I'll open ya head
For Young Lo, I'll let that 44 fill ya with led
For Big Monster, I'll pull out the Thompson & straight squeeze it
Behind Sean Wee I'll cut you off at the knees
For the Band I T, I'll close range ya with the mac
And for K.S.O lot, I'll put the Glock to ya back
Mddl Fnga, this ain't a act
This uncut coke
Don't ever play us for a joke
You'll get yo' bitch ass smoked
We go for broke

I got this drama
Don't worry mama
'Cause I got the armor
On my back when I
Drive through the streets
Everybody on me
Tryin' to take my life
But I don't give a
What about that
Grip that thing
Cock that back
You don't wanna be, gone
Another goner, gone
In the game, gone
Another Soldier, gone

But look no further, I'm the player for ya
Sittin big on the 20-somethin inch thangs
Leanin on the leather, grippin grain with them big rangs
Big piece, big chain with the big ice
You wanna roll? You ain't gotta ask the kid twice
Push a button, the do's open up for ya
I save the shotgun seat up in the trunk for ya
Stitch and tuck, so you know that I'm a boss
With the red candy paint lookin like spaghetti sauce
You wanna floss with a G, keep it real

You either won't or you will
Just keep it one hundred with a player baby tell me how you feel

Never call you a bitch when you act like a lady
You carry yourself like a woman and we gravy

Big mansion with the marble on the flo's
The world is yo's but here's the key
When I'm bein good to you, be good II me

I Luv That,II Trill,2008.0,"I love that shit
I love that shit
I love that shit

It's going down like it always do
I'm about to hit them, front door, front row with the crew
I pull up to valet in the '09 Cedes
And turn the heads of all the fly ladies
I lift the doors out, then lift the doors up
Step out the car and the whole world slows up
I show up like a certified pro
Looking like slow motion when I heads to the door
I walk right past the line to the rope
Everybody fall back like I'm the motherfuckin po'
And it's not even a question if I finna bring the strap in
They tried to pat me down but it ain't finna happen
Head to the bar, all eyes on B-da
From the haters and the fly mamacitas
And trust me man when the club this thick
You ain't even got to ask
I luv this shit

The club is packed, the bottles is popping
We make it rain when the models is bopping, mayne (I luv that shit)
Ladies shaking they backs
And all the players and the pimps is catching heart attacks, come on (I luv that shit)
Ayyo DJ turn it up (I luv that shit)
You got a beat, then let's burn it up {burn it up}
You know we do it B-I-G
So come and holla at a player in the V-I-P

UGK we in the house fo'sho
We about to crank this thing up and you already know
We in the club looking like new money
Put ya stunna shades on 'cause the ice too sunny
Me and my partners posted up at the bar
And we about to buy it out, for the price of your car
All the Ace of Spades, all the Rozay
All the syrup and white and Patron, okay?
They sending out ice buckets by the dozens
I pass 'em out to my dogs and my cousins
The whole club full of smoke and we buzzing
It's going down in here man, you thought it wasn't?
Moving through the club like a conga line
See the baddest little bopper, legs long and fine
And she like ""I love your ropes, are they solid gold or hollow B?""
I'll tell ya in the VIP, mami
Follow me


Ain't no party like a trill ass party, 'cause a trill ass party don't stop
Mayne it ain't no shorty like a trill ass shorty, 'cause a trill ass shorty gon' drop
Go on drop it down low to the floor, make it pop
I want to watch you wobble, show me what you got
Now go on work that, and twerk that
Now wiggle it around baby jerk that
Now toot it up, and boot it up
I'm cocked and loaded and imma shoot it up
Now grind it, dirty wind it
Now back it up, while I get behind it
Now go ahead and do your thang girl
Let it loose, let it go, let it hang girl
And shake what your momma gave ya for daddy
And maybe you can ride shotgun in the Caddy, come on

Man I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like a sucka (Why?)
I'd rather feed the worms than be a fake mothafucka (Huh)
Put my reputation on the line and it never wavered (Wavered)
It ain't just 'cause I'm trill (Trill) it's 'cause I'm highly favored (Favored)
Man, I'm papered up and flavored (Flavored)
And time for a tailor, then Italian leather shoes (Shoes)
Upgraded from them gators
Man, I'm top-floor residin' (Residin'), upgraded from them haters
And that's been ever since I've been a Vogue and Four skater
Man, I'm HOV and hold wait up
Goddammit it's the trill-ionaire
Rollin' with some Christians, thug niggas and a billionaire
Real street nigga I was Ollie in the nineties
Posted in the cut, boy, it wasn't hard to find me
But now I look back after the wars and the cases
The caskets that I closed on my dead homies' faces
Carried 'em on my shoulders to their final resting places
And told 'em ""Save your boy a spot at the table,"" just in case

'Cause it ain't easy bein' trill, but damn it it's necessary ('Sary)

I don't pay attention to business that don't concern a nigga
Swisha Sweet burnin' nigga, wood-wheel turnin' nigga
Pull up in the ice cream truck, and Big Worm a nigga
You talk a good game, but you ain't got no hands (Hands)
You never had a one-on-one fight, I understand (Stand)
You raised by the TV and the mothafuckin' radio
You ain't a man, you playin' like a man, must be crazy ho
All you know is jumpin' niggas and pullin' your Draco
Catch you without your strap, whoop the piss out of a fake ho
Catch you with that strap, I'm gonna light it up like Waco
Put them blue-tips right through your mothafuckin' cake hole
Give me a break, don't make me break you off a chunk
'Cause you ain't built for business, you's a mothafuckin' punk
You gon' end up in the trunk (Trunk) best to stay up in your lane (Lane)
Throw your set up and get wet up, these streets ain't playin' mane

Before they hid it in the gas or the tire (Tire)
Before a motherfucker even knew about a stash box
We just put work in the back of the car (Man), and mashed out (For real)
Now ask a nigga that was doin' it in nine-three
On the Interstate in a rental car you can find me
Suitcase is stuffed like a holiday turkey (Turkey)
Chopper right beside in case a nigga try to jerk me (Jerk me)
I did the city thing plus I played it out of state
Either way a nigga was known for havin' a lot of weight
Try to knock me down but it only made me bigger
Haters wanna see me fall but a nigga gotta keep on pushin'

Competition gettin' hectic, I'm headed for out of town
What I was, sellin' for twenty, niggas sellin' for ten
So I'm bout to take it to drastic measurements for my ends
My partner Rob in seventeen and in the Benz
And me I'm in a bucket but fuck it, that's how it is, shit
I got an ounce about to cut it into stones
Next stop: Port Arthur, Texas, I work it in the Lones
I'm a little nigga on his hustle bout to rise
I was cuttin' seventeen and I was only payin' five
A week went by, and a nigga took that dry
Back to H-Town, with re-up about to score me nine
A Pyrex bulb and the whoop so throwed
I cooked it for nine then I stretched it for nine more
Whoa, I'm that nigga bakin' with holes in his door
Crummy niggas sellin' that ether but fuck it, shit sold

Cause I am Mike Jordan, Mike Tyson, Mike Phelps
Michelangelo with the flow bro, and the mic helps
Ha! The mic stealth, that's for the mic's health
You'll take me out now that's the funniest shit, Mike Epps
They say the street need a hit, it ain't gon write itself
So I'mma set this bitch on fire, it ain't gon light itself
And I'mma beat the beat up, it ain't gon fight itself
Fucking let it write itself, until it good night itself
That's for the OG to do it
Just equip me and do
You know what we a do fool

'Cus I am Al Capone, John Gotti, Larry Hoover

Or do they slip and keep it moving like they never knew ya
You born a sucker, die a sucker, yeah, you get the picture
When you go, you gon' try to take some trill niggas wit ya
Son of bitch yeah, I say fuck you for a picture
Come in to get yo head a bodybag, this shoulda fit ya
Nigga talking down in your subliminal rap
We're playing, you get slow dice
Like slit through the craps
Snap back to reality, there'll be another studio
Casually, try to battle me
I leave them rattled G
That's for the OG to do it
Just between me and you
You know what we a do, fool
I will pull it back
I will let it go
I will lay it down


Staircases and aces, razor blade cameras and scrapers
Get through it big, I got the rhythm to bend cages
Choppa mad, places in front
We just stunt, you know my shakers
All of them shoot just like the Lakers
Paper fryers and Goliath, mission attired, he wired
Kill that nigga with the quick fast and tie it
Check that Houston goose and the cranberry will loosen niggas up
Quinton thought he was straight just like some moose and
Stat and Pharell busting them bow and arrows
We touch so we lowing sparrow
Chums is long and goofy like cousin Cowell
Truth or fire, dope fiends get crucified
Both teams is super loud
Me and Buns, the underworld is ours nigga
Pantries is filled with nothing but blow and scampy shrimps
Try to stop me nigga, shoot through his eyes
Blow trying to cope, copping the stove, he drove pop us

Cause them boys keep challenging me
So I'm gon make sure I can drop em (drop em)
Load em up and cock em (cock em)
Arms out the window and aim! (I will pull it back)
Aim! (I will let it go)

Candy coupe DeVille, ridin Cadillac bro

Catch me with yo baby momma, checkin on yo ho
A pocket full of bread and I don’t mean pita
Leanin on this ditch bitch, hand on the heater
Your gal on my meter, she begging me to beat er
But I really don’t want it, damn sure don’t need er
She a fly mamasita with a big round bottom
They come a dime a dozen and I damn sure got em
Somebody should’ve told er that I’m all about the pay so
Get up off yo knees, I need the cheese, get the ya sold

The south is what I rep so you can get it how you live
A glass house dropper so they know just who it is
With diamonds on the wood cuz I’m handling my biz
I’m jumpin up the hood so they know just how I feel

They gonna recognize it when you're fuckin with a G
They put me in the cross, I’m sending flowers to your team
I’m finna cut some branches down up off your family tree
I’m underground king, that’s forever and a day
And I’mma lay a hater down that up in my way
If you can ask him then you can explain

Now if you got it on yo mind
I can get it off your chest
Take it out yo mouth and I'm gon' take care of the rest
No stress, just do-do, when I'm jumpin' out the 4-door
Smoke 'll hit you like judo when you walk up to the yuko
When I let the top down, sippin lean still ballin'
TV's in the visors so the screens still fallin'
Niggas grab hustlin' I ain't finna break my neck
I make some paper off this flow, but I got rich off respect
Ask anybody who know me about my seeds
Westside 9th street, I came up amongst the G's
Crack game in 88, it took over shit I was there
I stood on southern through texas and got my share
And my nina on my waist, dope up in my jaw
One eye for them fiends, one eye for that law
Niggas crooks as niggas soft, so my rep is hard as steel
Big Bun muthaf**ka, representin' for the trill
(Chorus - Chamillionaire)
If you haters you gon' like us
If you like us you gon' hate us
But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers
'cause, friends turn to haters
And, some turn to traitors
But my money never changes (mhum)
So in Money We Trust
(repeat)
(Chamillionaire)
When white America stares at the pair of eyes in a colred face
Can they see why he love to chase
Green fetti in a gutta place
He grew up so he love the taste
For diniro's hes a disgrace
Denies that he's tellin' a lie lookin' right in his mother's face
Can't reside, in his brother's 'states
But out ridin' on dub's he take
What's hidin' above his waist, and go ride out some other fake
He's claimin' that he's real, but when he's not on that camera
Hed rather give stuff to these hoes, like he's copyin' Santa
When he's not on that camera, he's talkin' like he Pac with his grammar
But he will not cock or pop the top of his hammer
Money's the reason why rich people get red-dots on they flannels
While bank-tellers gotta get down on the floor like Dave Banner
Go ta spot in that 'Bama, and also got a spot in that channel
Few people know I got a spot to stash that knot in Atlanta
Don't trust the chick I with, she fine and mixed with another race
But I keep the combination to my safe in a safe in another place
(Chorus - Chamillionaire)
If you haters you gon' like us
If you like us you gon' hate us
But, one thing you can say is we some serious paper chasers
'cause, friends turn to haters
And, some turn to traitors
But my money never changes (mhum)
So in Money We Trust
(repeat)
(Slim Thug)
A lot of folks say when Slim got a lil change he changed
I ain't gon' lie yeah I changed, but it was for the better mayne
When I was broke ain't have to worry bout gold-diggin' hoes
When I was broke I ain't have to worry bout jackers tryin' to get my dough
Haters bustin' the .44's, 'cause I'm stickin' they chicks
I got a lot of best friends quick, when they heard I was rich
And them niggas I used to ride with, stack cash, get high with
Is the same niggas on my side, them the same niggas I'ma die with
Some friends turn foes, and some men turn hoes
But that's how the shit goes, when you ain't broke no more
Money the root of all evil, it could help or hurt people
You can't live without it so it tend to turn good guys evil
A lot of folks love money, more then they love theyself
I rather be dead then broke takin' death chances for wealth
I know niggas 'll kill you for scrilla and won't think twice to bust
Yo life ain't worth shit to us, (mhum) IN MONEY WE TRUST!
(Chorus - Chamillionaire)
If you haters you gon' like us
If you like us you gon' hate us

Baby your love is like a drug
I need it like a fiend
Every time I get it, it's got me gone like a fiend
Every time I hit it, it's like the best dro
And every time I'm with you I don't wanna let you go
See I don't think you know
How much you got me sprung
I'm walking around pacin' acting high strung
Try to go to sleep
But when I lay up in my bed
All I do is toss and turn to get you out my head (out my head)
It won't give me no peace I can't rest
Waking up in deep sweat shirt sticking to my chest (to my chest)
I feel it deep up in my stomach
And no matter how I try just can't run from it (run from it)
It's like an itch you can't scratch
Waiting on the chef to come through with a fresh batch (fresh batch)
I'm trying to keep it together but
I'm feeling like I'm going to need you forever
You got me on one

When I give you a call you don't answer your phone
When I pass by your house girl you're never at home
I'm doing everything I can just to leave you alone

I'm in the streets looking for you everywhere
People stop and they stare
But I just don't care

And everywhere I went man I was looking for that bitch, oh shit

Hey why you never at home
Why you never answer your cellular phone
Who that little bitch in front doorway
I'm gonna tell her you gone
How she know where I stay anyway
Hey what the hell are you on
I'm in the 5-50 bumping my (?)
With a lil' yellow bone watching my television
She in love with a nigga but she just won't admit it
Look why you playing hard to get?
Why you just want some niggas
We in Kansas City
I'm the man in the city
I'm (?) in the city
Say god dammit she pretty
I'm a sucker for hookers
But don't be tricking no dollars
How bout we gather our children off in a little country cottage
And this coupe with no mileage
Plus my passenger (?)
Now we way down in Houston with ambassador Bun
I'm an ace in the hole
Your nigga a rapper with guns
I'm the jack of all trades
And bitch he the master of none
(Hook)
(Verse 3: Devin The Dude)
I saw your friend the other day
She acted like she knew something I didn't
Then she turned around and started grinning
Like I was the butt of a joke
The last to know
Started to ask where you were
She acted like she had to go
Quick, birds of a feather I guess
I'm cold and sick, but nevertheless
I'm aight, can't sleep at night
I turn and I toss
Call you cellphone, but you turned that ho off
So I pace the floor
I can't wait no more
I try to find you but you know I won't chase you though
Now I'm going through some withdrawls
Without you I've gotta go and settle for some big drawls
And all I want to do is get another dose
I tried that other shit but you know what I love the most
I plug your hole if you let me
But you got me feeling all lonesome
Yah, I'm on one

Obama,UnKnown,UnKnown,"John McCain stands alone in his stuburn refusal to end the misguided war (Unexpected)
That's not the judgement we need, that won't keep America safe
We need a president who can face the plex of the future
Not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
(people cheering)

H-Town
The place is here the time is now
Election 08' and the day is slowly winding down
Fourth of November is the day, Barack Obama is the way
Think it's a game?
You wanna play not me it's too serious in Texas, G
This is history in the making that we blessed to see
A new day in direction of the people
For way to long America has been separate and not equal
We don't need a sequel of four more years
America is crying we don't need no more tears
We need real ideas about the future
Not Wal-Mart is won't hesitate, the streets shoot'cha
Health care, energy crisis, the economy
Community outreach, a new form of policy
Republicans you had ya chance but'cha blew it
It's time to turn Texas blue, I thought'cha knew it

The main party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country...
For affirm
(Crowd chanting)
And we are here, we are here because we love this country too much
So let the next four years look just like the last state
(Crowd cheering)

Yeah
When that call coming three in the morning I probably won't be in bed
Obama ain't the one that answer I probably goin be upset
War and fear in ya head with hope that I'll make ya scared
Supporting the wars for you till they come in and take ya kids
Government in the sky and you try'na reach for ya prayers
Leading the elevator they try'na get you the stairs
Trying me in economy try'na get me some bread
They putting Palin on TV and promise me pretty legs
Looking the Fox News try'na show some restrength
Every answer that I heard from Sarah Palin was lame
Tell her Whitehouse we on that porch nothing left to explain
I hope that Joe the Plumber got a empty room for McCain
Vote Obama Mayne

... That in America their son could achieve whatever he puts his mind to...
Cause that promise that's always set this country apart
The true hard work and sacrifice
Each of us could pursuit our individual dreams but still come together as one American family
Then sure that the next generation can pursuit their dreams as well

Paul Wall
It's time for a change
Two many bad chefs in the kitchen
Try'na sell us these war tickets but I ain't try'na listen
Too many politicians but now we need a leader
That can take us our recession end up hope our freedom
I got boys in Iraq and gone for years and months
That got two-year-old kids and ain't never seen them once
Hey, I got hope so no more jokes
On November fourth Barack Obama get my vote
Them boys at the capital been playing games for too long
It's time clean house so tell them boys to get gone
We got the power to make a change in our hands
So catch the stallied and go vote take a stand

These challenges are not all of government's fake
But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington
And the fail policy's of the tourist of the above

Cory Mo
Surviving is the only option that we have
So if you don't get off your ass, you goin wish that you had
It's more than just gas prices
We living in a national crisis
To see Obama win would be priceless (huh)
So vote Democratic and watch the game change
Or you can pick McCain if ya wanted to stay the same
We all a part of history don't take it for granted
Just take it one day at a time and keep both feet planted

I woke up seeing a blood feeling like coke out of my franchise greeter
Barack Obama that it's time for a change
Only it's the last? 'fore my life go down the drain
I know a class can give it up and victory go to McCain
The economy very pleated in the state of recession
But we goin fight who we fighting for us we hear to bring the pressure
It's a message to the wise you need to try before it's late
And realize the bath we use to make the one we gotta take
Wake up!",https://genius.com/Bun-b-obama-lyrics

I Am,No Mixtape,2019.0,"B. Barber

Well I am black and I'm proud of it
Stack up my dollars, get paid, in P.A. I'm gon' holler it
Bull shit, I'm tryna be tolerant
But all I know is how to be dominant, so dope shit I must fit
Do this for the streets where most people never drive
And goin' into the store for a Swisha could cost your life
Livin' in the city where the dirty niggas thrive
And the hard working mothafucka just tryna survive
You see the swangas and  people I hang with
Call us public nuisances doin' drugs or some gang shit
But see, we lookin' at the same shit
So we just gotta find a common language, so we can better frame shit
Feud is in the eye of the beholder
So before you turn a cold shoulder and judge a nigga, hol' up
Don't be selective, take a look at life from my perspective
And walk a mile in Jordans, it's hectic

Because we gotta do better, we gotta be smarter
We gotta be focused, we gotta go harder
We gotta honor our mothers and honor our fathers
We gotta take care of our sons and take care of our daughters
Keep these playa haters from around us
And leave the world better than it found us
Keep God first and everything else will follow
And that's the way we lead to a better tomorrow
To a better tomorrow

Well I am trill and I better be Bun to the letter B
They need an OG, that's what I let 'em see
Keep haters behind me and my blessings ahead of me
My family on the side of me, movin' forward steadily
Yeah people talk down, but I ain't let it get to me
I use they hatin' to my advantage and made a better me
So when they thought I was less than
I turned that shit into a lesson on not how to hate it on the next man
Now I don't know when and what neighborhood you grew up
But you can't win tearing me down to lift you up
Knock me off my feet, somebody knock you off of yours
Try for that bucket, the only one winnin' is Pappadeaux
Look, i know we ain't the same man, but we livin' on the same land
So we just need a better game plan
There's smarter ways to approach it
So we can come up for real and get up off that roach and that's the notion

'Cause we gotta do better, we gotta be smarter
We gotta be focused, we gotta go harder
We gotta honor our mothers and honor our fathers
We gotta take care of our sons and take care of our daughters
Keep these playa haters from around us
And leave the world better than it found us
Keep God first and everything else will follow
And that's the way we lead to a better tomorrow
To a better tomorrow

Well I am grateful even when niggas hateful
'Cause I serve a truer living God, keepin' my plate full
I'm never hungry, broke, or even thirsty
'Cause I know to wake up and give Him His praise firstly
Secondly, keep all eyes open for niggas thinkin' that they checkin' me
And make it clear there will be no disrespectin' me
See, you can live yo life however you feel
But me, myself, and I, we gon' forever be trill
And I'm still dodgin' the devil baby 'cause I'm blessed still
Reppin' for the Pimp, ABN, Mob, and still
Reppin' for Port Arthur and the whole south still
Spittin' this trill shit outta my whole mouth
And I'mma hold out instead of giving up
And shit, until the day I'm gone I'mma live it up
Doing what I gotta do for me and my fam
So I don't know if you keepin' it trill, but I am
I am",https://genius.com/Bun-b-i-am-lyrics
Don’t Say Shit,No Mixtape,2010,"(feat. Big Gipp (Goodie Mob))

Uh, hold up smoke something bitch, uh, uh
Everybody want to know why the airplane was late
I was waiting for whitey to get fucking paper straight
I'm an underground king nigga, lets my nuts hang
Nigga saying I'm only in (????) Ain't no thang nigga
Everybody rappin like they ballin' and they rich
I see em' in the streets, I ain't believing that shit
They diamonds ain't shining, and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm gripping on this grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm working wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville your stepdaddy can get killed
If he keeps talking shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you trying to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the south
For Them niggas and Them girls with them golds in they mouth
Them boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill bitch you ain't what this about...about...about

When you see me on the street, nigga don't say shit
Blowin' big on the sweep, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fucking with y'all
When I see you at the show, nigga don't say shit
Acting bad with ya ho, nigga don't say shit
Everybody want the ice and everybody want to ball
But everybody ain't trill so we ain't fucking with y'all

Say, nigga ain't got shit to hide
I ain't got nothing to prove
We ain't got nothing to gain but I got everything to lose
So I'm forever bring the blues to the issue
Pick and choose if I miss ya, stick and move when I diss ya
Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, It was made for me yo gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my, flow sly
Wait awhile you know why (Why?) too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars
Baby ballin' bullshitter frontin' like rottweiliers
No bark, no bite, but showing thangs
Talking loud like they knowing thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane,(????) your ass mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight
It ain't no passing tonight


People waiting, some be hating, I'll be shaking, they'll be faking
Waiting for me to fall, but yet they comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready keep that gun steady and ready
For anybody crossing the line with that fuck shit
I got a (????), got a hoe, got a trunk with the funk
Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump
Remember me? The one that had your back up in the club?
Remember me? The one that bring you on and show you love?
Remember me? The one that rolled by deep in a cadillina
With a rusty ass niner looking for trouble
So what? I know the same streets you know
Yeah so what? I go the same places you go
I got the mark in my skin so you know my set
I'm the heart, you the place, I'm always first, you always late
I'm the king in these streets till the muthafucking end
So you fuck with me, you gotta fuck with my friend",https://genius.com/Bun-b-dont-say-shit-lyrics
Untitled Flow (58 Bars),Trill OG,2010.0,"* iTunes bonus track

You see me, you know that I'm on my Deen
Down to get down anytime by any means
Known to be OT, reppin on any scene
And all about the paper, we stackin up plenty green
From my city to your city, it's all the same
These hoes disrespectin, they callin you out your name
These niggas lookin for work, there's guarantee to lock
Put they dope up in they sock, then head out to the block
These snitches wearin G uniforms to blend in
Yeah we know you one of the ones Feds gon' send in
Got caught, out of town, lookin at a dime
So you wanna give other niggas ya time
And here's the new plan, they cut the dope way before you can
By the time you get it, you like what the fuck to do man?
You better be a certified chef
Or your whole sellers fittin to go left to the death
And street niggas ain't got receipts so
They fittin to try to sleep yo ass on the d-low
Ridin like Deebo, comin like Carter
You rollin like Marsellus Wallace, we roll harder
Start a situation and we bring it to the end
So take a memo motherfucker, send it to a friend
Then send it to your kin or whoever care
'Cause when we come, we takin out whoever there
Yeah, real talk, this is real nigga attitude
Bring it your face, give me longitude and latitude
Better show me some gratitude
Or I'm a show you why God himself ain't never made a badder dude
Then the one standin in front of you
Bitch you know what I'm a do and don't call me B, this Mr. Bun to you
Motherfucker fix ya grammar
The next time you call a nigga bamma, you better have a hammer
And I ain't talkin 'bout all that nail shit
I'm talkin 'bout they poppin off and makin you bail shit
We ride like Amtrak cross country
You badder bitch? Then come in front and try to chump me
Ah shit, ding, ding goes the bell
That's the sign that ya bitch ass is fittin to take a L
Don't give it to ya homeboy, take it for yourself
And after I give it to ya, you can take it and tell
And put in on ya Facebook wall
And let your friends see, how a trill nigga took y'all and shook y'all
Stompin like a nigga that's ten foot tall
But don't trip it's just a friendly game of football
Hold up and I'm the Super Bowl quarterback
But yo bitch ass? You ain't even much a starter jack
Go ahead and take ya team to the showers
When we done with the trophy bitch, you can have ours
'Cause we packin more power
And bound to make ya stop, drop and roll like the fuckin Twin Towers
Hours on the clock goin by like seconds
When you in the middle of a chin check and I wreck it
With real live thugs at my beck and call
They won't find no trouble disrespectin y'all
So you bound to fall, somebody yell ""timber!""
You fuckin with the down South King, call me Simba
And remember, who the fuck ya talkin to
Or you'll see the pearly gates you'll be walkin through, fool",https://genius.com/Bun-b-untitled-flow-58-bars-lyrics

What I Represent,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro - Mannie Fresh)
The, the underground, the, the underground, the, the underground...
The, the underground, the, the underground, the, the, the underground...
(Bun B)
Now this one here for everybody out there off the top
This for the real slab-swangas whipping dubs and drops
For the real block huggers that's embracing the grind
And the three-time fellas that be facing some time
For them real deep boys that be baking and serving
And the real hood hustlas that be shaking and swerving
For the real cut-throwers putting work in on the average
And trill ass niggas living they life like a savage
A lot of niggas hold it down for they set
And when the work comes easy
And when the game ain't ready
They really rep they're neighborhood good or bad
Niggas that really be on the block throwing signs and flags
Well I'm here to represent for all the gangstas and the thugs
And the underdog niggas that ain't getting no love
For a nigga trying' to make a weight for him and his crew
Just recognize I'm representing for you, and nigga that's on the true
(Hook - Bun B + (Mannie Fresh))
I'm a sell my dope, I'm a bust my guns
I'm a fuck my hoes, I'm a stack my ones
What I represent?
(The, the underground, the, the underground, the, the underground...)
I'm a smoke my good, I'm a sip my drank
I'm a grip my grain, I'm a drip my paint
What I represent?
(The, the underground, the, the underground, the, the, the underground...)
(Bun B)
Now everybody wanna act like they already got it made
With the houses, and the cars, and the bills all paid
Got a million in the bank, and two million in jewels
But on the cool, life ain't like that for a lot of these fools
Lot of people in this world coming up pretty hard
Raised in project apartments, with no front yard
Had to share their clothes and shoes with cousins and brothers
Never had they own shit, they had to share it with others
I wasn't born with a silver-spoon sticking out my grill
I was raised in the middle of the struggle on the real
Had some hard times in my life, trying to make ends meet
Not to mention, trying not to fall victim to the streets
Against the odds, a nigga made it out the game
But that don't mean that I'm gunna forget about from where I came
UGK ain't just a name; it's what a nigga is
I was there before I got in the biz, and nigga that's on the rizz
(Hook)
(Bun B)
Now people always be around when you shining and balling
But they real hard to find when tough times come calling
You got money, doing good, and they be all in your face
Then disappear like Sue Storm soon as you catch a case
It's like clockwork homeboy, the shit never fails
Soon as they think the party's over, everybody bails
Could a sworn they was your friends when your world was on shine
But soon as you get some time, outta sight, outta mind
It's a shame that some real ass niggas took a fall
It's a shame how they treat you when you locked behind the wall
When your woman won't visit and your homie won't send you no flicks
Or come and see you, that's some cold ass shit
Well I miss my nigga, he was down for me
That's why I got the whole world screaming ""Free Pimp C""
And I'll be right here waiting when you touch back down
UGK we still holding the crown, kings of the underground

Get the Bird,Bun B Day,2019.0,"The game dirty, but the money is dirtier
Better get it while you can, get off your ass, nigga hurry up

Let's get it hot, nigga stir it up

Naw, don't act like you've never heard of us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier

Sittin' at the table, starin' at a mountain
For the next couple a hours, I'ma be cookin' and countin'
My gut is kinda old and rushin' so slow your roll
Like Robitussin, 'cause it ain't no discusssion
Triple O-G, I'm certified and some other nouns
You too light in the ass, better call your big brotha down
Or your old man, I'm too heavy to hold man
I brought a six-pack of whoop-ass, you gets a whole can
It's been said before, but let me repeat it
I give the rap game what is needed and undefeated
In a league of my own, so you clones better reckognize
Kobe eatin' Kobe beef, you eatin' Checker's fries
Lyrical exercise, what is this practice?
When it's game time, we puttin' banners in the rafters
Money you can't fit in rubber bands is what we're after
Think we don't want the cheese like Kraft, then ask us

The game dirty, but the money is dirtier
Better get it while you can, get off your ass, nigga hurry up
They talk a whole lotta shit but that never worry us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier

Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier

Young nigga tryna touch an M
I make money not friends
Five K for the appearance
Had to take a little break, we been baggin' up for a minute
You should come and join my gym, on weight in a minute
Look, I don't give a fuck about what you claim you did
'Cause me I'm just a see it for myself kinda nigga
We ain't never worried, we the ones with all the guns
KelTec with the beam, choppa-pistols and pumps
Extended clips and drums
It could be a man down, as quick as you count to one
Young underground king, I give 'em the shit they want
Give 'em the shit they miss
Motivate in the streets, that way they never forget
I ain't perfect, but I'm real close
Ain't got no hate in my blood, except when a bitch get on my nerves
Early morning countin' a quarter-mill
Ain't plannin' on slowin' down, I gotta get it while I'm still here

The game dirty, but the money is dirtier
Better get it while you can, get off your ass, nigga hurry up
They talk a whole lotta shit but that never worry us

Well it's big Bun B now, baby, Mr. Woodgrain
With diamonds up against them balling through your hood mayn
And I'm smoking on some good mayn, the color purple
Not the movie, but the kind that have you going in a circle
Chrome, looking more classy than the Transco Tower
Car drippin' candy paint like it just came out the shower
Like 'Face I got the money, the power and the finesse
To roll around one deep with hundred-thousand round my neck
I'm looking real shiny; you can see me from a mile away
Thought you was doing it, until I came and took your smile away
Pull up on your side in the turning lane
Pop my trunk, break you off, chunk a deuce, and I'm Cadillac turning mayn
Little swang to the left, big swang to the right
My plates scraping and I'm sliding the pipe, it's super tight
So don't try to knock us baby, don't try to hate
That's how we do it in that Lone star state; get it straight (we be...)
(Chorus) - Repeat 2X
(Bun B)
Now if you never been to Texas, there's a picture to paint
Cause we doing it real big, in case you thinking we ain't
It's lots of money on these streets, being spent and being made
All it take is one look to see these boys getting paid
They living laid in big houses, with pools in the backyard
Certified gangsters so you never see us act fraud
With iced out watches, bracelets, chains
Pieces, teeth, mayn we throwed in the game
We got screens in that headrest, visors in the ceiling
On chrome 83's and fours and Vogue peeling
With bumpers and belts across the back of my trunk
Push a button, and my car is waiving bye to you punk
We from the land of sippin' on syrup and (banging the Screw)
We slab swangin' comin down and through, I thought you knew
Back in the days, all they ever did was doubt us
Now the South is in the house, and they can't do nothing about us (we be...)
(Chorus) - Repeat 2X

One time for my trill niggas reppin the block
The real soldiers on the frontline is keeping it cocked
They hold it down for they hood, throw it up, let 'em see it
So they can know how you G it, if they hating, so be it
We ain't playing where I'm staying cause it's way too real
No matter the situation, we gotta keep it trill
Got the steel on my side when I ride cause I'm ready
I got 20/10 vision and my trigger finger steady
I'm an Underground King homeboy, and not a simp
And I gots to represent 'til they decide to free the Pimp
I'm down for my click, just like I'm down for my block
And I'm a stand up for my partner 'til they let him off of lock
So go on, body rock, Southside or lean back
Two-step with your boy if you about your greenbacks
This here is a Texas toast so raise your glass
Because the whole dirty South fittin' to show they naked ass (we be...)

Bitch it's the king of the trill, I'm top of the line
My paint is on drip, my rims is on shine
My butter seats reclined, cherry oak is grip
With swisha sweets to blow, and purple rain to sip
Now straight up off the rip, I'm letting boys know
I've never been a bitch, don't plan to be a hoe
So if you got some plex, you better keep it low
I bring it to your chest, soon as you hit the do'
You know me as a pro, respect me as a vet
I put it down befo', you ain't seen nothing yet
My candy still glossy, my 4's still flossy
My rocks real icey, I'm looking kinda bossy
And feeling real saucy, it's time to get it crunk
Now watch me pop it fly, just like I'm popping trunk
The leader of the pack, the star of the show
When Bun is in the building, you already know
(Hook: Mannie Fresh)
I'm fresh (I'm fresh), brand new (brand new)
Everytime, that I come through
Hoe look at my wrist (my wrist), my neck (my neck)
I just bust me a fat ass check, hoe
I'm the man (I'm the man), he's a whimp (he's a whimp)
If you wanna get ahead, get a pimp
Dope boy shoes, big rings
And only bad bitches say my name, hoe
(Bun B)
Bitch you wanna roll with a pimp, then have it on your mind
It's all about this bread, so you gon have to grind
I gotta stay on shine, so you know what that means
You gotta hit that track, and bring me back that green
Cause daddy need his ice, and daddy need his chain
We gotta keep it G, so rec' him as the game
A hoe need a pimp, a pimp need a hoe
And tricks need us both, so let's go get that do'
In case you didn't know, I haven't been told
But pussy on the corner, and it's as good as sold
It's tricks on the prowl, so stay out on that stroll
Cause I'ma sell your cot, and you gon sell your soul
My pimping way too cold, but it's gon keep me warm
With minks up on my back, and rocks up in my charm
So bitch ring the alarm, and tell 'em I've arrived
The greatest ever born, that's dead or alive

Bitch you know that Rap-A-Lot's the click, and UGK's the fam
It's middle fingers up, cause we don't give a damn
Them Caddy do's slam, that top gon drop
Them 4's gon tip, them blades gon chop
Them deuces get chunked, them screens gon fall
It's Southside holding, so we gon ball
And slabs gon crawl, them 3's gon swang
That woman gon shine, that trunk go bang
And underground king, from P.A.T
I miss my dog, so free Pimp C
And I'ma hold it down, and rep for my team
To keep us on the map, so he can get that green
I work the triple beam, electronic scale
Even a baby bottle, whatever get that mail
So Mannie please tell em, the motherfucking real
Why Bun coulda be, so motherfucking trill

24's,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You can find me on 24's
Blowin' on a pound of dro
Getting gone in the wind
Sitting behind tint
Getting bent
You can't see me
But you smell the smoke
Oh yeah
*Repeat

Now what you know bout the H town
Clutch city the throwdest
With them big body slab swangers on the grind
And you know this
Got them buttons and bumper kits
Them buckles and belts
With pop trunk, shiny grill
Keeping it Trill with ourself
We break left and lack turn to the right
And bust his Glock off - what
And if one time roll up
We ain't fittin turn this knock off
I'm a crank this surround up
And show him my thang
And if we need us another corner to slang
It ain't a thang
We got that 3rd Ward, that Yellowstone, 5th Ward and the Acres
Dirty dub back to the Southside we fulla bar breakers
So anywhere you want to take us
Guarantee you can show him up
I'm a crank him like a seal on a PT and pour him up
Paul Wall the OG Ron see to slow him up
So if ya'll reppin some down ass hoods player than throw 'em up
Keep the Trillness in front of me and them haters behind me
So Magic if you're lookin Bum be this how you gone find me...my nigga
How?

I'm on the 10 goin' West and I'm heading straight to the H
From Louisiana got money to make
They got some bitches I didn't cut
Some clubs I didn't crash
Some bars I haven't run up the tab on a nigga ass
Neglecting my nuts I work too much
Fuck gettin' tipsy tryin' to get fucked up
I need some rup to sip
So I can lean in my cut dogg
Eyes focused on pussy
Run some G on a damn broad
I'm with Bun and Mike Gizzle
Sippin' and dippin' til at least 7 in the morn
My 24's I call them the hoe catchers
Catch the type of hoes that wouldn't usually sweat ya
Bet cha I do it bigger than ya'll
40 gals on call to entertain my dogs
Just bring me some good and a big fat goo
So I can puff and blow smoke on a hater like you

Makin money is all I know
24's is all I roll
Killa dro that's all I blow
In the lime light I shine and glow
Mr Magic and Bun be want to live lavish then come with me
As I flip the script in my Humvee
Grindin for my currency
281-330-8004 hit Mike Jones up on the low
'cause Mike Jones about to blow
I'm in a Lex
Black on black ballin'
24's and up when I'm crawlin
Grind daily to keep from fallin
Got hot now majors callin
I'm Mike Jones
Puttin down for Swisher house
Princess cuts all in my mouth
Representin that dirty South
Stay on the grind from 9 to 9
Hope and pray one day I'll shine
Body Head, Swisher House and Middle Fingers we on the
Grind
I'm in a Benz on Lorenz 24's in the wind
My daily routine is pimpin pens
I'm Mike Jones
Who?

Know what I'm sayin

Ro & Bun,UnKnown,UnKnown,"When we in the club, we got guns
You don't wanna run up, on that Z-Ro and that Bun
Shit talkers, get a hole in they tongue
Shake your hand or crack your head, boy we don't bar none hold up
Sharp as a razor blade, bitch don't step on my shoes
You out your mind, thinking I won't pull out this weapon on you
Phoenix Amare gators hater, yeah I'm stepping on you
So you better have at least, a 3-57 on you
Your woman is in the club, to show me love
That's why you mean mugging me bro, but I don't give a fuck
Don't let this suit fool ya, cause I was raised to grub
All that touchy-feely shit, the quickest way you get fucked up
I know you feeling real good, you full of that sherm and alcohol
But it ain't nothing friendly about me, I am not your pal at all
Unless you Rochelle and do nails, with them thick ass thighs
Otherwise I'ma leave a cereal bowl hole, in y'all bitch ass guys

When we in the club, we got guns
You don't wanna run up, on that Z-Ro and that Bun
Shit talkers, get a hole in they tongue
Shake your hand or crack your head, boy we don't bar none hold up
It was the summertime, and Bun is down to mack a hoe (hoe)
You know I graduated, from my pimping class in '94
So the sco' already known, before the game is played
Trill niggas is getting paid, bitch niggas is getting sprayed
Laid down, like a sheet on the bed with that heat to your head
I split you from the white meat to the red
And from the red meat to the bone, when I hit your street with the chrome
Bitch you best to beat your feet, and get gone
But if haters I find that hid (hid), and think they got away with what they did
Prepare for your bitch ass, to get slid
Put that on my mama (mama), I put on for my town
Put that thang up to yo' melon, and put your ass in the ground hol' up

When we in the club, we got guns
You don't wanna run up, on that Z-Ro and that Bun
Shit talkers, get a hole in they tongue
Shake your hand or crack your head, boy we don't bar none hold up
I don't really wanna do it take some pictures, and sign some auto-ma-graphs
Find a lil' bit of love for after the club, and put this rod on her ass
So I might be up and down your boulevard, picking up your baby mama mayn
And you already know I'm strapped, best thang for you to do save the drama mayn
I'm an asshole by nature, by my god damn self
I don't love see war this bitch, I only love my god damn wealth
Behind respect I go to war, cause I'm a fool in this bitch
I'm ready to work I'm a mechanic, I got my tools in this bitch
From Mo City to Port Arthur, we all underground kings
Meet me in Mo City, and I'll show you what underground mean
I got a rifle size hand cannon, gat in the club
Murder your ass tonight, tomorrow I'll be back in the club for real

When we in the club, we got guns
You don't wanna run up, on that Z-Ro and that Bun
Shit talkers, get a hole in they tongue
Shake your hand or crack your head, boy we don't bar none hold up",https://genius.com/Bun-b-ro-and-bun-lyrics

Know that we got guns, know that we gon ride
Blow out your insides and leave you to rot
Cause when we give it to u bitch we give u all that we
Now all it takes is one shot to put your ass in a ditch
But you gon get the other 49 for bein a bitch
Go to war with the big men when it makes no sense to
Repercussions get extreme when we ride against you
Ain't no movie, your baby mama, teachers and your kids
Everybody finna get it for the shit that u did
So when I get to your crib, better come out swingin
Cause the devil ain't even ready for this hell Im bringin
We dont want no dope
We dont want no cash
We dont want no excuses
We just want your ass
So when that front door crash, and u see them soldiers
When that gun go blast, dont say Bun didn't told ya

If I I pull it out my pocket, be the first one to bust
We ain't playin wit u hoes
Retaliation is a must
First nigga make a move, first nigga hit the dutch

One playa, two heats

Fuck beef I got a K for niggas
In spots the law won't find u for days my niggas

Show ya how to get cha overs up and lock the grams
Boys know me in the hood, but not for rappin
Back street trappin, front line, ya boys a captain
First nigga to shot, I ain't tryna talk
Bring the heat to the hospital and finish u off
No life is a come up, when Im rollin with my gun up
Dont get ya bitch gun, but nigga what u want, what?

Pop your bitch ass, then I go and smoke it over

Gave us the word, said we keep the bird
Leavin is for nerds, I put your brain on the curb, fucka
Pull ya piece nigga, and watch ya rest it

The white flag u wavin, now its on bitch please
All your love ones houses lookin like swiss cheese

And if you be like me, then you already knew it
We goin' for the money then we goin' right through it
Take it to the table baby, chop it up and screw it
'Cause it ain't nothin' to it where come from, but to do it
We get it in our hands, and then it go right through the fingas
We standin' on the system in a fresh set of swangas
We pop a couple tags, put some fresh up on the hangas
That everyday struggle and can't nair nigga change us
Believe that I was famous 'fore I ever did a song
Believe I had a poppin' 'fore a label put me on
It's 2010 and I ain't seein' nothin' wrong
But niggas countin' money all day fuckin' long


Money totin', pistol carrying young nigga thugged out
Very first song I ever dropped was in a drug house
Razor blades, sandwich bags, Louis shoes, stoopid swag
Rubber bands, duffle bags, small bills, trash bags
Apple chain on my neck, you know that cost stoopid cash
Maserati for the wash, that's that foolish cash
Penitentiary chances, '6's on a muscle car
Bun helped me keep it real and watch it take me far
My money don't fold, this money here
I ain't make it for no hoes, I ain't get this off of shows
Count money all day, count money all night
Trust no one wit' my paper, so I count my paper twice
I been on wit' out my paper, so I sleep wit' it at night
Now I wake up wit' to my paper so I start my day off right
They call me Cocaine Gotti, and it's money over bitches
Mr. Everything White, he be always in the kitchen


It's me Gucci
I'm the shit bitch you smell me
Ain't no need to check ya sneakers
Three bricks, plus a split wit' me, then bitch you got a hit
Big money on my leisure, pop bottles wit' top models
Wit' my goons in Puerto Rico, yo' girlfriend I'ma freak her
Believe me I'm a giant, leave it to the lemurs(?)
I only see my paper plus my cojan on the Sanyo
The hottest rapper that you know, people look like Cujo (Gucci)
I get a thousand million ties and sold your guys for uno
So tune into East Atlanta, please don't change the channel ma
Roll the windows down back up
In my Phantom show my automa

And don't worry 'bout what the fuck we smokin' over here
Don't worry 'bout what the fuck we drankin' over here
Don't worry 'bout who the fuck was standing over here
Don't worry 'bout how the fuck we dancing over here
I gotta a stable full of hoes and a trap full of dealers
A house full of bloods and a click full of killers
I'm heavy on the streets with a rep long as old Nash
I hit a hater wit a heat from a cold gat
We posted up on a black like a street light
Watching the money move making sure I eat right
Dollar for dollar and dime for dime
We out here hustle for hustle, nigga grind for grind
We got them nines in them halfs
Even them old things grinding on them hash
Folding for doe mane and we all in the dope game, buying and selling
You haters buying and telling, but what is my niggas yelling
We getting money over here, what it do pimpin'
See ya boys looking but y'all lame ain't tipping
Hold up, a, yeah it's some wrong wit it
If your money gon' nigga be the fuck on wit it

Don't worry 'bout what the fuck we drankin' over here

Slam dunk in pimping and her sister if she close enough

Look over hear

Grab the mic a watch these niggas tuck there tail and look in fear
As I bust around with no shells inside in myself
Lyrics like a counseled weapon sending you bitches straight to hell

Burning up just like in waco Texas
Heating up your neckless
Scorching up your afro the devil coming at your
Ass any hard one for niggas who really want it
M-J- fucking G with pussy and titties on it

Them bitches love when they see pimping come up in it
24 inches under something smoking tinted
Hustle hard for keep it cause I love to spend it
Pimping love is when your style is when you love to hit it


I came a long way from a posta posta
Till I kosta nostra kept the toaster closer
Than I'm supposed to well I poast ya procha
Ride like a roller coaster
Pistol whip you hold ya throat then choke you like a croacha croacha rocha
Pull out a light and smoke you (damn)
Pull my coat off I blessed man just stressed man
Just still elementary just a glance couldn't learn it is hurting my chances
Pack pistols just to blast it (blast it)
I put it to second guessers I blast it it just to prove it (prove it)
Mother fuckers get a moving (moving)
I born into hustling I grew up tustling
Gave my muscle in and got into meeting my frail but hell I put my trust in
My left and right hand grinding threw the night
And I keep my family right and see some paper like a white man
Balling in the ninth (and) we holding in the light (and) sippin on worthless
Sprite and you can call it what you like
I call what the fuck I feel play the courts that fucking peel
But we ain't sleeping till they free and pimping here that's the fucking drill",https://genius.com/Bun-b-bezzle-lyrics

No beat I can't wreck no rapper I can't blow through
Breathing life back into hip hop I got the O2
I told you how you gonna beef with me nigga you done fool

No tellin the kind of shit that I'm a pull
I pull a move pull a card pull a stain
Shoot da 5 cut ya buck fifty let a bullet bang
It ain't a thing nigga kinda like a unit
I do this with my eyes wide shut like I'm Kubrick
I can break it all the way down to the cubic
They gon swear that I was digging at em like a tooth pick
Go stupid, flunk the IQ test
I got a new gun better yet a new vest
The shit I'm shooting ain't selling in the US
Wondering if I'm pointing that muthf-cker at you, yes
So quit acting like a muthf-cking dust my friend
Bun B I'm back at it once again
Got tungsten skin titanium teeth

Nigga you  sitting home on the sofa

I’m Ballin (feat. Jazze Pha),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Intro)
Oooooohweeee
Alright-alright-alright, (ok-ok)
Ok-ok-ok, (alright-alright-alright)
Alright-alright-alright, (ok-ok)
Ok-ok-ok, (alright-alright-alright)
It's Bun B and (Jazze Phizzle-Phizzle)
It's Bun B and (Phizzle-Phizzle-Phizzle)
It's Bun B and (Jazze Phizzle-Phizzle)
Bun B, UGK sho nuff ladies and gentlemen
(Hook: Jazze Pha - 2x)
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
(Bun B)
Before I jump up out my silk sheets, and hop off in the shower
It's already understood, I got the money and the power
I grab the baby powder, under shirt and white tee
My Dickies, fitted cap and white one's that's me
A hundred karats worth of rocks, courtesy of Johnny
I roll a couple blunts, and load up the Tommy
Ready to get my stunt on, my pockets on swoll
Now all I gotta do, is see which car I'm finna roll
Now I can take the Benz, or I can take the Rover
And if I pull the Bentley Coupe out, then it's over
But I'ma keep it O-G, and pull out the slab
So I can sit on buck, and have some wood grain to grab
Last but not least, before I pull out on the scene
You know I gotta po' me up, my oily cup of lean
I've been stacking all this green, now it's time for some spending
I've been cool about this grinding, but ain't no mo' pretending
(Hook - 2x)
(Bun B)
Now if you see me in the shopping center, walking down the hall
It's already understood, that I'm buying out the mall
I got six homies with me, and at least two freaks
Man we looking for the Louis, and the Gucci boutiques
I keep the flyest footwear, and the newest Locs
And if I get some'ing for me, I'm getting some'ing for my folks
Cause we all gon be fitted up, we all popping tags
We all walking out of this mall, with big bags
And I ain't gotta brag, you can see it for yourself
I got ballers on my right side, and ballers on my left
We ain't from the same hoods, but it's all to the good
We bout getting this money, like some real G's should
And we ain't knocking nobody's hustle, why plex man
You only hate on yourself, when you hating on the next man
You can't be like Bun B, so why try to
Get your own bread, and you can ball just like I do
(Hook - 2x)
(Bun B)
Before I pull up to the valet, and hop out of the car
It's already understood, that we buying out the bar
It's a line around the corner, people trying to get inside
But a playa like myself, is finna walk right by it
Now move the velvet rope, and keep the scanner
You don't wanna see us angry, like we David Banner
2000 and 5, Tony Montana haters
Ain't no need for you to knock us, just congratulate us
We done made it out the ghetto, by staying on the grind
We focused on the paper chase, with money on our mind
Now we just wanna shine, buy some bottles and pop em
So if you see niggaz out there, playa hating then stop em
Cause we don't really wanna have, to bust a motherfucker's head
We just wanna holla at bad bitches, and spend this bread
We buying everybody drinks, and making it rain
Cause I'ma rep, like a motherfucking underground king

Runnin' from the one-time

They was 'bout to hate a nigga like me in due time
A real nigga
A trill nigga
A down to get down, don't make me have to kill, nigga
'Cause I will, nigga
On the real, nigga
Hit you in your back, from waist down you won't feel, nigga
When that banana clip peel, nigga
It drop tall, short, big, and lil' niggas
Then it drop house niggas and bill  niggas
So you better watch your back, we on your heel, nigga
So you best be on your toe, nigga
We lay it down, real niggas and hoe niggas
Layin' down his niggas and yo niggas
'Dem niggas, those niggas, anything goes, niggas
Catch you at the studio or at the show, nigga
Comin' out the barber shop or jewelry store, nigga
At the Chevron or at the Texico, nigga
With your main bitch or with yo side hoe, nigga
Waitin' at the front, back, and side door, nigga
Soon as we see ya, you know we let go, nigga
And we don't care about the set you , nigga
Or the hood you represent, what for, nigga?
You got four niggas? You need more niggas
So bring a , maybe ten, even though, nigga
And even then, nigga
You can't win, nigga
Now when you try'na fuck with B-U-N, nigga
I got them fresh up out the pen niggas
Who don't give a fuck about goin' back in, nigga
And you don't wanna know where they been, nigga
And you don't want to go where they send niggas
'Cause wherever they begin, nigga
They ain't stoppin' 'til your heartbeat end, nigga
So ain't no need to pretend, nigga
Like we cool, you ain't my mother fuckin' friend, nigga
You ain't down with me, , nigga
So we can get it poppin', just say when, nigga
I come around the  and straight bend niggas
Take that blood in the mud and make it blend, nigga
Now watch the chopper slugs spin niggas
Like Michael Joe Jackson singing Ben, nigga
And when I check you on your chin, nigga
It's R.I.P. for you, just like him, nigga
Reppin' P.A.T. live from Houston, nigga
And we don't give a fuck, we gets it in, nigga
'Cause we off niggas, then we end niggas
Like Frankie man down, code ten, nigga
Blowin' stanky, puttin' dro up in the wind, nigga
Pass the cup, I'm 'bout to pour me up some Hen', nigga
 slept the same way I pimp the pen, nigga
And God only made one, there's no twin, nigga
The closest thing to me was my brother, nigga
And after me, there will never be another, nigga
Not a tighter nigga
Or a tougher nigga
Or a writer nigga
Or a rougher nigga
That'll leave a chicken-hearted nigga smothered, nigga
And if you didn't know then you finna discover, nigga
While we make these pussy niggas run for cover, nigga
They screamin' for they daddy and they fuckin' mother, nigga
'Cause we ain't scared to squab and straight duff a nigga
This rappa like the mob, they try'na cuff a nigga
They even sendin' undercover niggas
That's why you gettin' stuffed up in the duffel, nigga
So spy all you wanna spy, nigga
And keep on tryin' all the fuck you wanna try, nigga
Not me and my niggas
You know why, nigga?
It's U.G.K. for life until we die, nigga
That's true stories, no lie, nigga
Bet yo ass, you can put that on P.I., nigga
We gon' ride for H-town like G.I., nigga
Ain't got no love for a mother fuckin' C.I., nigga
Naw, you ain't gettin' in, is you high, nigga?
We been keepin' game, you ain't sly, nigga
My pistol never jam like it's God, nigga
And it's known to make a nigga's momma cry, nigga
Trill niggas known to make the slugs fly, nigga
Them bullets droppin' like it's rain from the sky, nigga
And when it's over, ain't no need in askin' why, nigga

You can open your mind
You can fall you can fly
Just dont die (dont die)
Just dont die, die, die, die

Look here homeboy its time to stop playin'
The world is gettin' crazy especially the hood i stay in
The old ways of the world is just decayin'
For better or for worse, i dont no, but all im sayin'
Is day in and day out is the same old same, the same old players and the same old game
We make a couple dollars then we spend it
Herdin in the drop but we always pretend it
Like its all good but its all bad cause its slow, and we really can't move it like we used to no more (no more)
So we hustle just to keep up the illusion, we always winnin' we all or we losin'
Lets keep it real, dont sweep the shit under the rug
Dont nobody die rich from selling drugs
They just die (just die, just die)
Now thats cold but thats true, so tell me what the fuck is yo ass gon' do

You can run for your life
You can stay here and fight
Just dont die (dont die)

Damn it feels good to see people up on it
You can feel it in the air like sequel up on it
They dont know im rich, cause i dont flaunt it
Already a target like the local with the scope on it
Ate the food on your plate, im back for seconds
U dude's got it backward like the black sabbath record, check it
Its like they tryin to get the message
We deep in the recession people reachin for their weapons, bleh
Hunger said it make a peaceful mutherfucker violent
Motivation niggas b whilin when their stomach growls
Express yourself to strength in numbers no one wants an honest speak your mind, but always respect the code of silence (shhhhh)
Brooklyn dudes quick to buck ya
But the quick its sticky the blood is too thick
The quicker picker upers, hey
You can bring bounty, shit its in your clothes
Bring dounty
You can't get rid of it
(chorus)
You can run for your life
You can stay here and fight
Just dont die (dont die)
Just dont die, die, die, die
You can open your mind
You can fall you can fly

And to live the lifestyle of the stars

Now I'm a make it do what it do

I look back at my past and man I got to think (think)
Of where I came from (from) and what I've been through (through)

I remember, my days as a young'n
The alley ways and back streets we used to run in
Who knew back then that some would kill

Bun B, UGK sho nuff ladies and gentlemen
(Hook: Jazze Pha - 2x)
Got me some bread, made some paper
Costly fabrics, minks and gators bitch I'm balling
(diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good
Got diamonds on my chest, keep me looking good)
(Bun B)
Before I jump up out my silk sheets, and hop off in the shower
It's already understood, I got the money and the power
I grab the baby powder, under shirt and white tee
My Dickies, fitted cap and white one's that's me
A hundred karats worth of rocks, courtesy of Johnny
I roll a couple blunts, and load up the Tommy
Ready to get my stunt on, my pockets on swoll
Now all I gotta do, is see which car I'm finna roll
Now I can take the Benz, or I can take the Rover
And if I pull the Bentley Coupe out, then it's over
But I'ma keep it O-G, and pull out the slab
So I can sit on buck, and have some wood grain to grab
Last but not least, before I pull out on the scene
You know I gotta po' me up, my oily cup of lean
I've been stacking all this green, now it's time for some spending
I've been cool about this grinding, but ain't no mo' pretending
(Hook - 2x)
(Bun B)
Now if you see me in the shopping center, walking down the hall
It's already understood, that I'm buying out the mall
I got six homies with me, and at least two freaks
Man we looking for the Louis, and the Gucci boutiques
I keep the flyest footwear, and the newest Locs
And if I get some'ing for me, I'm getting some'ing for my folks
Cause we all gon be fitted up, we all popping tags
We all walking out of this mall, with big bags
And I ain't gotta brag, you can see it for yourself
I got ballers on my right side, and ballers on my left
We ain't from the same hoods, but it's all to the good
We bout getting this money, like some real G's should
And we ain't knocking nobody's hustle, why plex man
You only hate on yourself, when you hating on the next man
You can't be like Bun B, so why try to
Get your own bread, and you can ball just like I do
(Hook - 2x)
(Bun B)
Before I pull up to the valet, and hop out of the car
It's already understood, that we buying out the bar
It's a line around the corner, people trying to get inside
But a playa like myself, is finna walk right by it
Now move the velvet rope, and keep the scanner
You don't wanna see us angry, like we David Banner
2000 and 5, Tony Montana haters
Ain't no need for you to knock us, just congratulate us
We done made it out the ghetto, by staying on the grind
We focused on the paper chase, with money on our mind
Now we just wanna shine, buy some bottles and pop em
So if you see niggaz out there, playa hating then stop em
Cause we don't really wanna have, to bust a motherfucker's head
We just wanna holla at bad bitches, and spend this bread
We buying everybody drinks, and making it rain
Cause I'ma rep, like a motherfucking underground king

In here, I been here and don't plan on leavin'
The king of the trill's 'bout to pass, who's receivin?
I'm throwin', I'm throwed on, the mic I explode
Slow all that bangin' man just like my load
Don't test me or stress me, I'm in that mode
Where I could just black out and leave yo' ass flo'ed
Benze's and Beamers I drove 'em and slabbed 'em
Big booty hoes I exposed 'em and grabbed 'em
Take 'em right out of they clothes and I have 'em
They pussy is golden (what) my dick is platinum
And hard as a diamond, I'm hard when I'm rhymin'
I'm closer to God, like Eric B. I'm in
That get money frame of mind, any day and time
That's what this is and shit ain't no shame in mine
Back on that bullshit so bring in the cattle
Ready for war so let's get to the battle
Niggas is babies with bottles and rattles
The street lights is on, it's your curfew, ske-daddle
That all you got G? You comin' up short
You ain't got the muscle, you ain't got the heart
You need actin' classes, you can't play the part
Yo' mind ain't on money you need to get smart
I'm known to spit darts that'll land in the center
Right in the red for the breadwinner in her
Stack in the summer, the ball in the winter
I'm grippin' that wood (shit) just got a splinter
You's a beginner, a novice, a rookie
How you got bricks when you can't cop a cookie?
We after paper, you after the nookie
You bet against me and you lost, pay the bookie
Twista!
They can never run in my shoes
They know nothin' 'bout the ones and the twos (nope)
Murder to the drums when I bruise
Twista killin' them with Bun and the Blues (yup)
Competition better study harder
Cause I feel like we done found another tune (tune)
They gon' try to to be like Muddy Waters
I'm a be the man howlin at the moon (arooo!)
Comin' up and standin on my stack (stack)
And you still listen out the ride (ride)
I ain't even got a car note (nope)
Y'all ain't snappin cause you wicked crushed
And I'm a get 'em, I could tell her (tell her)
Fall dash rapper when you tell 'em bust
He can even spit the a cappella ('pella)
He can even come right off the top (no)
He don't kill 'em even though he crumb (no)
He can only kill 'em in the studio
When somebody can help him make a song (yeah)
Ask me why I don't hear it, I told ya
On the blues we come colder, Bun B's a boa
Constrictor, Twista inflicts the pain of a cobra
Flame and I'm a show ya, the remains of a soldier
Down home blues killin' niggas in the game, 'til it's over",https://genius.com/Bun-b-speakeasy-duplicate-lyrics

This World,UnKnown,2020.0,"Snippet-full song release TBD

Cory Mo
Zaytoven

I've seen joy and pain in this world (This world)
I'm just tryin' to remain in this world  (This world)
I even pray to God for change in this world
I've seen some troubled times in this world
'Cause my Black life matters in this world (This world, this world, this world)
'Til we're equal in this world
Power to the people in this world (This world, this world)

Man, it's 2020, who would have thought
That the fight for basic civil rights was still left to be fought
Even after we lost Huey, Hampton, Martin and Malcolm
To racist elite power structures whiter than talcum?
See, they've been treatin' my people likе they ain't equal
Since thе slave ships and now we livin' in a sequel
Talkin' 'bout 'em lynchin' us, burnin' us and killin' us
For 400 years, and man, they still ain't feelin' us!",https://genius.com/Bun-b-this-world-lyrics
We Do,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I do ride bently's and coupes. But I don't give away all my looks trip over a silly tramp I don't ride less than twenty inches I won't
