The Symphony,"In Control, Volume 1",1988,"I don't care who's first or who last
But I know that y'all just better
Rock this at the drop of a dime baby
I don't know what y'all gon' do with this, but it got to be funky
It got to be funky if you're gonna be on it
I don't care who start
I don't care what y'all do
But you got to be finished
Before the music is through
Now who's first up to bat?

Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
But just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'mma give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""A"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'mma hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: No bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it, I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone bitin' in any form
Yo, I'm only warm
, that verse was the calm, now here's the storm

Next up... (Yo, I believe that's me)
Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That thought I wasn't comin' out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, ""Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin'?
Yo, Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize, oh yeah, and uh
Can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': on surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive
Cuz on the mic, my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events
And since I have a call, I call experience

Next up... (Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony

Yo, Marley gives the slice,
 I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifyin' as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
That make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips
, step on reps
You flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
So, if you want rage, I'mma make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, today's the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill, though, solo, cuz you're still all... soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So, fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me
Bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Serve the sucker, the order is manslaughter
Another rapper G Rap wrecks
He's rated X, that means the boy is sex, next
The amplifier gets used and abused
Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang a rapper or singer
I'm puttin' up my middle finger

Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are bein' poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear -- then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
'Cause rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis
And broken down mics were the only trace is
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So, take caution, I'm not horsin' around
In a throwdown, clown, I'm takin' yours, son
So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it
'Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone
Chokin' on a bone cause Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to your health
So, put a quarter in your ass cause ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade,
 you need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun
; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
'Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, MC's, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge
Don't barge
'Cause goddamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant, you're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't wit' it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior
, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate
Disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin', so put Kane in
That category, period, end of story

Not in my book
Y'all are supposed to keep going until the end of the record
I still hear beats, what's wrong with you?
Yo, fellas y'all got to do somethin' on this them tracks
So let the track house you, what?
So let the track house you, what?
Yo, I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I can't believe it
I can't believe it",https://genius.com/Marley-marl-the-symphony-lyrics
Simon Says,"In Control, Volume 1",1988.0,"(Let's play a little game)
(Okay, I'm loosin up now)
(Aw - there it is!)
(I've waited long enough)
Bust a move, let's play a little Simon Says
So take your places and listen to the rhymin as
I like display a new style that just may
Leave suckers runnin for the door in total dismay
Yeah, by now, so you're startin to
Get a little hype, but first get a partner
And proceed full speed right to the dance arena
I really doubt it, but maybe by chance you seen a-
Nother brother more inclined to play the part of Simon
Than the Master Ace who knows the art of rhymin
Like a shark knows the finer points of swimmin
Like Steady Pace know the cuts and the fly women
And so before we start this game
Simon says: get up, and yo, I do the same
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: look deep into your partner's eyes
(Let's play a little game)
Look at your partner from head to toe
(Let's play a little game)
And all those good parts in between, you know
(Let's play a little game)
Simon says: it gets badder, and you never had a
Beat that can heat your feet, and still add a
Theme with so much steam, it makes sweat pour
]From your faces, and the Ace is sure
Gonna do it, as you listen to it
See, I navigate ya straight to help through it
I'm Simon, rhymin, climbin on time, and
On a mission, that's the position that I'm in
Takin you there, makin you care
I'm achin to tear up the floor, but I don't dare
Leave the mic sittin, gettin cold without my hand on
Those that dance don't have a foot to stand on
And those that don't dance, yo, you oughta know
Simon says: wall flowers aren't allowed to grow
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: close your eyes
And imagine your partner totally unclothed
(Let's play a little game)
Nude, in the butt, bare to the flesh
Now get as close as you can to your partner
And without touching him, move your body to the rhythm
(Let's play a little game)
Simon takes the stand, just as planned
And I display in a ray that's rather grand
Now I agree, there are many who said 'party's off'
But if one of them says, he drops arty soft
See to drop hard you must have the kind of mind
That's refined and artistically lined
Cause yo, it takes nack if you wanna attack
Attract with such skill, and still fit the bill
Ace and Action, few can come harder
Than we come, uhm - here's some, but only part of
The gift that can lift the myth that is swift
Only boast the most, yo, Simon says: if
If your partner's face is in place with your taste
Then haste, you better push up, no time to waste
So if you're with it, you better get it, don't try to sit it
On a chair and stare like a square, brother, quit it
There's no time for nerds and geeks, only freaks
With the sexy cheeks, as the Master speaks
And for weeks and weeks you will dance and prance
To the rhythm I enhance with my chants
So here's a glance at a jam that'll nullify
And fry all the rest, bust the color
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, in the gold and violet
This jam is fly, and I'm the pilot
Flyin you straight to the end of the rainbow
Steady and I try to open your brain, so
You can accept what was carefully kept
Till the fun stops, then the party was pepped
Up, and if you stepped up, you couldn't hold your place in a chair
So hail Simon, the brother Master Ace in the rear
Simon says: yeeeaah...
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: put your right hand on your partner's shoulder
And put your left hand on your partner's waist
(Let's play a little game)
Now move your hips rhythmatically
(Let's play a little game)
Now the climax...
Simon says: touch your partner's body
Touch your partner's body
In every way imaginable
Yeah
Do the nasty
(Let's play a little game)
I wanna say what's up to my DJ Steady Pace
Sha-Born the technician
Ray for real
Eye-Cu Rock and the rest of the Action Posse
Special thanks to DJ Marley Marl
And Tim Westwood rockin things out in U.K
(Okay, I'm loosin up now)
Peace, world

The Symphony Part II,"In Control, Vol. 2: For Your Steering Pleasure",UnKnown,"I'm about to run, run a race with the rhythm
If you know the bass steps, dance, do it wit 'em
Gotta clock Gs, 'cause a G is worth a thousand
When I kick these types of rhymes I be housin'
All I wanna be, gonna be big shotties
Brothers ain't wit it then I do it for the hotties
But I know they wit it 'cause they know I ain't a phony
And it feels good like Tony! Toni! Toné!
And I like to kick a rhyme, rhyme for the people
Wanna reach the top? Climb, climb to the steeple
Top to high? Well, you best get a ladder
Say you're from the slum? Well, chum, it don't matter
Forget where you're from, it's all about where you're goin'
My name is Masta Ace and I don't tip-toe and
Never stall, fall, lose my grip or take a slip
Make a house call, hit a dip and then I skip
But not to my Lou, I never played hopscotch
Music man, baby, and the rhymes are top notch
Gotta try to uplift, lift the ghetto dweller
I try my best to never riff, riff wit' a fella
A brother sometimes tries to play it like tennis
Then it's time to pull teeth like a dentist
Oh, brother, brother, please don't play it
The rhyme is prime every time that I say it
Action's in effect, nothin' change but the weather
Juice Crew? Nah, but we still rock together
Craig G
(Yo, I believe that's me)
Aiyo, Craig G
(Yo, I believe that's me)
Aiyo, Craig G
(Yo, man, I believe that's me)
Kick it
1,2,3

Yo, once again, a brother's back to attract many age groups
Sportin' green and beige boots, poppin' like a hula hoop
You step to me and you'll be steppin' to a death wish
You probably thought I'm soft, of course you never met this
I'm not a crazy man, gun-totin' hooligan
But pass a mic to me and rappers I'll be doin' in
So, yo, uh, slide to the left a bit
'Cause I'm about to blow up in the '90s and I bet you get
Jelly and think of tryin' to do me
I work for my spot, so don't try to remove me
'Cause I can swing a rap like a batter hits a fast ball
Put on my track shoes and run right past all
Corny MC's and wannabes
Get played like a permanent crease in your Lees
So, next time the wizard gets you soft as a heart
Don't step to me because I rip the shit apart
Now, this ain't Mr. Rogers and I never play pretend
So, think about it, chump, if you step to me again
Yo, Big Daddy
(Yo, I believe that's me)
Aiyo, Big Daddy
(Yo, I believe that's me)
Big Daddy
(Oooh, I guess that's me)
1,2,3

Uhh, damn, it's true, I'm livin' mathematics
Asiatic, comin' up on the microphone just like an addict
Made to fit, 100% legit
As soon as I hit, ooooh, shit!
'Cause I'm gonna make the audience applaud me and support me
And award me when they saw me in action with my ???
Sharper than any other instrument
That archeologists can find, never known to mankind
'Cause I'm a rare species
And all you Filthy McNasty MC's can't even see me
You're too fragile to touch this mad style
Girls be runnin' up sayin', ""Oooh, you're too bad, child""
So, save your breath and exit stage left
Retreat before you meet defeat and greet death
You and any champion that even tries to touch this
Won't even get to keep his title long as Douglas
See, I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Oh, you still standin' there? (Yo, yo, look out, duck, kid)
I'm brashin' and bashin', crash and smash MC's
And enemies wit' these
'Cause I make sure everythin' comes out smooth

But you know your little brother must deserve his groove
Drop somethin', quick release a rhyme wit' quickness
To let MCs know about my existence
Any MC to last a minute is pure lucky
'Cause I'm the baddest kid that you seen since Chucky
Well, Kool G Rap
(Yo, I believe that's me)
So, G Rap
(Yo, I believe that's me)
So, Kool G Rap

Yo, straight out the muthafuckin' gutter
I open my shutter to butt-ass brothers
And rip 'em up like a box cutter
You press up? I pull the trigger
I figured nobody could dig a Milli Vanilli-ass nigga
Prepare for shootin' fair, I'm knockin' boots daily
Fruits, I rip 'em out of their Roots like Alex Haley
Here I come straight to the mouth
I'm kickin' it slick, lyrics are harder than a dick inside a whore house
Your neighborhood hero's a zero
I'm sendin' muthafuckers on a Midnight Run like DeNiro
So, here goes a rappatittatackle
Feel a steel scalpel pressed up on your Adam's apple
Reach for the pistol and you're crazy
Try to blast and I'll be spinnin' that ass like Patrick Swayze
Said he was frightened when I rocked, they came in a flock
What is this shit, New Kids on the Cock?
Wanna battle? You need a paddle, 'cause shit creek's deep
But since you're ridin' on my dick, you need a saddle
No survivors, I spit 'em out just like saliva
Well, next stop ??? and I'm the driver
So, fake rappers try to diss, you're a little too proud
But niggas on white clouds are on my shit list
Do your ass in like Kennedy's assassin
Murder the whole mass and time for tresspassin'
I flow on notes like a sailor
Hoes are like clothes, I got they ass sewn up just like a tailor
Kool G Rap - one in a million
You're rollin' the dice to get sliced the fuck up like a Sicilian
A nigga can't do shit for me

Marley Marl Scratch,Street Jams: Hip-Hop From the Top Part 3,UnKnown,"All these beats and my rhymes attached
Form the new creation called the Marley Scratch
We're always steered in a positive course
His beats, my rhymes, combined make force
I say it's like a force cos the force is strong
And if you think we're weak I'd say you're wrong
All you other DJ's are a bunch of jerks
Marley give 'em an example how a DJ works

Since you just heard how a DJ sound
The name Marley Marl, I will break it down
The M is for Master of Scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
The A is a letter that you set apart
I wouldn't call his beats music, I would call it Art
The R just stands for the way he Rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock
The L is for Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sounds out of sight
The E is for Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
Don't play with the Y cos it isn't a game
You ax ""Why do you put the other DJ's to shame?""
After this there shouldn't be a story to tell
At the end of that is M-A-R-L
This paragraph here has come to a end
Marley, can we hear your funky fresh scratchin' again?

I never got caught in the game of Tag
My name is MC Shan, no need to brag
MC's brag about theirself all through their rhyme
You can see I got quality, won't waste my time
If I did not mean it, I wouldn't have said it
I'm gonna give the man behind the wheels some credit
I'm not tryna say that he can't be beat
But Marley Marl can stand on his own two feet
Since a DJ like him is so in demand
Marley won't you get on and show 'em where you stand

He can go on but I won't insist
How many fortunate MC's have a DJ like this
Every time I grab the mic I always have a plan
He's DJ Marley Marl and I am MC Shan
Combined we're fresh, this you must admit
Don't ever wanna hear you say we ain't worth jack
To be a DJ or an MC well it isn't no thing
If you ever wanna learn then just give us a ring
Like I just said, it wasn't no thing
You either have to be a ace, a jack, a queen or a king
When you're one of these, that means you're the best
And the people of today won't settle for less
We can be a jack or king, we can play the place
But we'd rather be a DJ and an MC ace

If you ever wanna battle, be at your best
Because a man like Marley just does not fess
In that battle you must give your all
Or just be prepared to take your fall
Cos a lotta DJ's already tried
There ain't been one yet that's qualified
To think you can beat him, you must be nuts
Just listen real close to his scratchin' cuts

The man Marley Marl can bring you to tears
He's not a new jack, he been down for years
On the two turntables I would say he's nice
Every cut he makes is so precise
When I said precise inside my rhyme
To put it to you straight that means right on time
Every jam he throws he always rocked
Don't refer to him as the neighbourhood jock
To all you DJ's who are always fessin'
From this man you can learn a lesson
You heard Dimples D when she took her stand
She said 
(Marley Marl is one hell of a man)
..
Gotta get it off my chest, to put my mind at ease
Since when you heard a DJ make cuts like these?",https://genius.com/Marley-marl-marley-marl-scratch-lyrics

Yo, this jam is dedicated to you, boy, just listen
Take off your coat, get in a fit position
Cause I'm about to burn you at 450 Fahrenheit
You're jealous of the crew, that's why you're staring, right?
Forget the answer, the situation's obvious
When this is over, let's see who feels the sorriest
You'll be like, ""Damn Craig, why did you play me, yo?""
And then you realize we're top in rap radio
Cause it's no game, boy, you can't do work
Marley, please tell us his name (Duck Alert)

(Has your crew suddenly become interested in promoting a war?)

Now our crew is broken down into a large amount of channels
And not one of us can you handle
On the mic Magic, on the tables Marley
And when it comes to bein dope, don't ask: are we?
Cause our style is different, or should I say irregular?
And if you wanna get all hype, I'll have to settle ya
By pulling out my 12-gauge shotgun
And if you wanna go rhyme for rhyme, I got some
Dope rhymes for sure, or should I say galore?
But I won't sound old-schoolish, in other words foolish
I have a question now: who feels hurt?
Marley, do you have the answer? (Duck Alert)
Thank (yee-ee-aah)

(What happened between us, was for us alone)
(Yee-ee-aah)

(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yeeeeeeh)

After this, I hope you get someone to battle me
But make sure this person has originality
That's right, original, yeah, you heard me
I don't want his beats sounding like Hurby's
Oops -- I mean Marley, cause Hurb's a beat-biter
I don't know where the both of you get the right to
Come in the industry, steal someone's property
And some of you from it start clocking g's
Now that's not fair, Marley's the rightful owner
Yet you still treat him like he's a blood-donor
So now it's time to have revenge to all you jerks
Especially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)
That's right
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(You're from where?)

Um - at the final stage, cut the scratches
Marley Marl? I think no one can match his
Cutting ability on the 1200s
And many listeners, they often wonder
(Yo man, was that a tape?!) Nah, never in a milion years
You see, the liveness gives us the feeling we're
Being accepted as true entertainers
And it will stay that way for the remainder
Of the century, that's how it's meant to be
You don't believe me? You will eventually
Because the situation, boy, you can't divert
Especially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)

Droppin’ Science,"In Control, Volume 1",1988.0,"(Get) (Get)
(Get)
(Get funky)
I'm droppin science

When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad
My rhymes start to flow, so I simply must brag
About my style that makes you vibrant, I keep drivin
Until the song turns me to a hip-hop giant
Me and Marley Marl, we're goin one on one
For any sucker rapper that chooses to come
And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin
I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing?
They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip
Suckers just have to flip cause I'm so hip
Craig G and Marley Marl, we form the ultimate alliance
No sucker can deal when I'm droppin science


Rappers: Ask yourself the same question
Why am I best in this profession?
Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo
Or the things Marley does in the studio?
I drop science as if I was Butterfingers
And I know there's not another singer
In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme
Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine
And when it comes to havin showmanship
I really don't care who you go and get
Cause rappers hate me, I'm so defiant
And I can get stupid just by droppin science


Livin larger than life, and what this means is
We'll be the dopest duo comin outta Queensbridge
Now crews hate us cause we're extraordinaire
For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare
These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit
And sized perfectly, so that they can fit
You're steppin to us? You need traction
Or you'll be another sucker missin in action
You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it
My smokin rhymes, you always think of it
I eat MC's up like a pack of hungry lions
So step out my way, I'm droppin science


The Vernon Posse along with me Craig G
Is gonna rock it till the crowd begs me
To kick the next verse, your context's worse
Like all the others, that's why I get respect first
And believe me, I'm never on on others
Cause as a member of Cold Chillin'/Warner Brothers
I do swear to uphold this
Title of rap to be the boldest
Among so many MC's

The Rebel,"In Control, Volume 1",1988,"I'm here to bust your shit, the mastermind of manuscripts
The force of extremity, my rhymes are the remedy
You can't deal with the T-R-A-G
Rap annihilist flowing like Pegasus
Rhyming this easily as the obvious
I bust your head pulsating rotating
This jam is generating with the motion I'm creating
I'm the boy wonder, Tragic super duper
Raised in the Bridge, cause I'm a Queensbridge trooper
The rebel of the treble, the ebony prince
'88 is on the way, I make a big difference
I make it visual and intellectually clear
(Tragedy) the Rebel is here


Because I massacrate kids turning flesh to dust
And knocking all boots is a definite must
Cause I'm Havoc, Trag, Tragedy, Tragic
There are many ways to explain my magic
The explanatory category best fits me
Cause my lyrics are called sweet poetry
And I'm sick of b-boys just hipping and hopping it
I have you sayin, ""Damn boy, shorty be dropping it""
Back in the '60s to know is to know it
And I'm the last remaining of the world's last poets
Talkologist, infinity from when I begin
And to disapprove the Trag is a mortal sin
Diabolical gangster, hoodlum and genius
I write poetry when I find it convenient
Snap a stage in half like a polar bear
(Your Tragedy) the Rebel is here


I drop words you won't find in a dictionary
I write rhymes to improve my vocabulary
Drama, Art, English education
And I'm the man, I design the animation
Mentally and with jock control
The equalizer rises up on your FM mode
In which I use with telepath
And it's (Tragedy) who's on your phonograph
I confuse your conscience, and boggle your brain
You may think that I'm sick, but I'm perfectly sane
I design my rhymes with architectural construction
But that's another story, a different function
You see, it's mandatory to invoke fear
(Tragedy) the Rebel is here


The rap automatical, the rhymatical
Forget ill, I get illmatical
Biceps pulsating in my lungs
Queensbridge Projects is where I'm from
Wicked like a witch doing sorcery
With a book and a pen, and my M-I-C
The outstanding ovation when things get drastic
You keep fantasizing while I'm fantastic
Black magic flowing smooth but strong
And I'll have you rocking and shocking

Keep Your Eyes on the Prize,"In Control, Volume 1",1988.0,"To get where you wanna be
You have to set a goal
And keep your eyes on the prize
Yeah

Now let me take a second, just so I can beckon
And call out an all-out rush just like wreckin
Your brain as you strain to maintain, sustain
The way you felt because I dealt you pain
And pleasure, in every single measure
You miss being kissed by this lyrical treasure
Enjoy it at your leisure, cause it's gonna please ya
Master Ace and Action again is here to ease ya
Spirit, cause all you have to do is hear it
And you'll catch a stroke
And say, ""Damn, that brother broke!""
Now I'm about to get off another funky hit off
And if you think you're hangin, yo, I think you bit off
More than you can chew, now how you gonna swallow it?
Check the technique, see if you can follow it
Like a path or a road made of yellow bricks
Yo Steady Pace, go 'head and bust the mellow mix


So keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
And keep your eyes on the prize

Now I'm the capital A and what I'm sayin is conveyin
That I romp, stomp and jump on any competition
That's opposed to me, they can't get close to me
You say that goes to see, what's that supposed to be?
Some kind of challenge? I take you head up
Beat up and eat up punks and won't let up
But not with my fist or even with a deadly weapon
But with my lyrics, yeah, that's how I'm steppin
On all those that doubt me or my race is won
And you critics are hopin that the Ace is done
But now consider, this here little bit of
Super commentary for those that are very
Misdirected and lookin for some kinda angle
Censorship is their attempt to strangle
The Master, they know that my words can motivate
And set straight the crooked from their fate
Don't you understand that rap is like a tool to me
You're sellin what? You're actin likea fool to me
Go get a job or maybe go and learn a trade
And make the grade, that's how you get paid
Steady's on the cut and Action is the posse
Open your eyes and you'll see what I see
Brothers are fallin, homegirls are callin
Themselves independent, but yo, we're all in
The same boat together, it doesn't matter whether
You disagree, it's still reality - see


Now where're we goin, where are we goin, which direction?
Look at your reflection, now someone praise the resurrection
Of a people many years considered kin
To an animal, unlike those with lighter
 skin
But that's the past and many knew it couldn't last
By peaceful means or either by a rifle blast
Or whatever, better late than never
We finally arrived and yo, the dream has survived
But many died tryin and they're the ones that paved the way
Real live supermen and -women save the day
So that we can live our life without ?????
Racial oppression, mental anguish through aggression
So realize what it took for us to rise
And don't sleep but reap and keep your eyes on the prize


Sing a song of six pence, a pocket full of crack
Think you're sayin somethin, you ain't sayin jack
Now tell me, what is goin on these days?
From what I'm seein lately I'd say crime pays
Cause somebody is gettin paid
I think it's time to sprinkle some rain on the parade
Now listen, take this as a word from the wise
I'm not a prophet or a preacher, just a man with eyes
And I've been witnessed the fitness of a neighborhood worsen
You oughta hold a person-to-person
Discussion with those who rose from that level
Usin a broom or a mop or a shovel
Not on the corner waitin for the big pay-off
It's not comin, so why not stay off
The streets, believe me it beats bein sent up-
State on a date with the man and bein pinned up
In solitary, take advantage of your freedom
I'm givin helpful hands cause you need em
It's not all about the cash you make
Sellin poison to boys and girls - you're a fake
So what you got a cable, so what you got a BM?
You love when the girls go, ""Ooh, did you see him!""
So what your pocket's filled with 20s and 10s
You're gonna find out just how fast that ends
Cause one day you'll be drivin round the way in your ride
There'll be a bullet with your name on the side
And if you don't believe what I'm tellin you, mack
When you're layin on the ground with a hole in your back
Lookin up at the sky, gettin closer to hell
Just remember Master Ace had a story to tell
Yeah
Yo
Keep your eyes on the prize (5X)
Keep your eyes on the prize (5X)

We Write the Songs,"In Control, Volume 1",1988.0,"Give me the beat boy

Yo it just me and Heavy D in the house
I can't forget my man Marley Marl
Hey, I got Keith and Shawn right next to me 
I'd like to send this out to my man, Cool V
Who you wanna send out to?
DJ Eddie F, Trouble T-Roy, and my man G-Wiz up in the money 
I can't forget Big Daddy Kane, and my whole crew
Cool Joe Brown from Centereach
And we gon' do a little something like this
Like what?

I'm the original B-I-Z Mark
Buyin' a record like collecting put ya body in the park
This is a little something for the Juice Crew
From Hev and the boyz and Biz the DJ that's won two
This is a little something from Biz Markie
That make you get up and D-A-N-C-E
That's why I made this one just for you
To do the Heavy D shaking and Biz dance too
Now I'ma get deep like Jacques Cousteau
And the stuff that I be saying is always thorough
That's why I made a introducing due to death rap
To make your hands clapped, feet tapped
I'm like the diabolical scientist, Mr. Far
To send extra crazy super like funky vibes
'Cause I always come with stuff nobody else does
That's why they call me The Inhuman Orchestra
The Heavy D, say hi
Hey yo what you wanna know?
I wanna know if you can rock the disco show

Now yes, on the smooth tip, the Overweight Lover
I'm on your radio and your magazine cover
I drink Coca-Colo, remain the rhyme solo
Always wear Nike but, once in awhile I sport polo
Before I go to bed, I drink my milk and eat cookies
Never like school, so I used to play hookie
New jacks of rap, I choose to call 'em rookie
Your choice is the Heavy D voice, now you can boogie
Emcees think I'm new to this, they must be dizzy
'Cause on the microphone Heva keep the crowd busy
Nothing in the world could ever stop my groove
The Overweight Lover's in the house, and I can get smooth

We write the songs that make the whole world sing
We write the songs to all the crazy things
We write the songs that make the emcees cry
Me and Heavy D, we write the songs, we write the songs

So party people in the place, without further adieu
The S-K B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E is for you
Well I'm Long Island's number one with the rhymes I invent
Say or spit a story up to all you ladies in the gym
 number one master afro from all you ladies
Guaranteed to rock the mic and take out all your emcees
That's why you hear me rockin' as one of the best
I come first place and, end ya contest
With the bass in your face that you'll appreciate
I'm known as the living legend and the all time great
You know the emcees on a hell of a predicament
They go against the S-K-B Markie in this tournament
I go to a party, I am a spectator
When you battle me, I am Darth Vader
 in the place for a testing
Know you be chilling in the mo for the money you're spending
I came here to rap beats for your satisfaction
Biz Markie and Heavy D is the special attraction
When I came to the door you pay ten duckets
If you battle me I take you out to
 rockin' off for any kinda rap
To get the girl so hot, they want to get naked
I'm super duper emcee and I'm educated
1982, the year I graduated
Heavy D, say hi
Yo, what you wanna know?
I wanna know if you, I wanna know if you, I wanna know if you can rock the show
Lord have mercy on those who cursed me

I wreck for respect but first me and Bizzie Markie's gonna dance a little
So meet your tender vittle, I mean your tricking little
Yo, can I get a little?
Microphone check one two, and three in
I am Heavy D and he's the B-I-Z-M-A-R-kie
For better for worse but not forgotten
Always fresh never stale or even rides
So Biz Markie, say hi
Hi

(Yee-ee-aah)
(The Crew will not understand it)

Yo, this jam is dedicated to you, boy, just listen
Take off your coat, get in a fit position
Cause I'm about to burn you at 450 Fahrenheit
You're jealous of the crew, that's why you're starin, right?
Forget the answer, the situation's obvious
When this is over, let's see who feels the sorriest
You'll be like, ""Damn Craig, why did you play me, yo?""
And then you realize we're toppin rap radio
Cause it's no game, boy, you can't do work
Marley, please tell us his name (Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Has your crew suddenly become interested in promoting a war?)

Now our crew is broken down into a large amount of channels
And not one of us can you handle
On the mic Magic, on the tables Marley
And when it comes to bein dope, don't ask: are we?
Cos our style is different, or should I say irregular?
And if you wanna get all hype, I'll have to settle ya
By pullin out my 12-gauge shotgun
And if you wanna go rhyme for rhyme, I got some
Dope rhymes for sure, or should I say galore?
But I won't sound old-schoolish, in other words foolish
I have a question now: who feels hurt?
Marley, do you have the answer? (Duck Alert)

(Yeeeeeeh)

After this, I hope you get someone to battle me
But make sure this person has originality
That's right, original, yeah, you heard me
I don't want his beats soundin like Hurby's
Oops - I mean Marley, cause Hurb's a beat-biter
I don't know where the both of you get the right to
Come in the industry, steal someone's property
And some of you, forbid, start clocking's
Now that's not fair, Marley's the rightful owner
Yet you still treat him like he's a blood-doner
So now it's time to have revenge to all you jerks
Especially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)
That's right
(Yee-ee-aah)

(I am speaking to you from the Bridge)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(Duck Alert)
(Yee-ee-aah)
(You're from where?)

Ehm - at the final stage, cut the scratches
Marley Marl? I think no one can match his
Cuttin ability on the 1200s
And many listeners, they often wonder
(Yo man, was that a tape?!) Nah, never in a milion years
You see, the liveness gives us the feelin we're
Bein accepted as true entertainers
And it will stay that way for the remainder
Of the century, that's how it's meant to be
You don't believe me? You will eventually
Because the situation, boy, you can't divert
Escpecially who, Marley? (Duck Alert)

Freedom / Give Me My Freedom,"In Control, Volume 1",1988.0,"It's Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass it
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, give me my freedom

I wanna break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim it theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I dont need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom

I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my freedom

We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down then the beats would catch it
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom",https://genius.com/Marley-marl-freedom-give-me-my-freedom-lyrics
The Symphony (feat. The Juice Crew),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Master Ace, Craig G, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane)

Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""A"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Caruso
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm...
Next up (Yo, I believe that's me). Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, ""Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo Craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony...

Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than ConEdison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, to mean the boy is sex. Next...
The amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord;
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear - then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
Cuz rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
Cuz if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cuz Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, cuz ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
Cuz when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, MCs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cuz gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin. So put Kane in, that category. Period. End of story...",https://genius.com/Marley-marl-the-symphony-feat-the-juice-crew-lyrics

Now I got that uh, I got ahead of it the other day man
On top of wildness playa check this
We checkin out some kung-foo flicks and my man grippin madena
I think we seen her
Jackie Chan and feelin Syeena
Shame is from all the crew
Actin out of order too
Realize we short a boo
Down to the last quarter too
The thought “to do”
Send some of my people to the store
Said the PlayStation broke
Everybody bum rush for the door
We all together deep
Warriors that never sleep
Up the street
Here come that that QB don’t ever sleep
Well now today we making Eye-contact
Looking all flamboyant
Nipples at a straight point
She stopped and said “hi”
Told me I be looking fly
She like the way I coordinate my timbs and DKNY
“thank you”
I said I thought you had a real stuck up attitude
Cuz I ain’t never seen ya kicking it with without a dude
When told me why there ain’t no man do you know
The answer almost made my head stand up like Coolio
Whoa
She said it ain’t about that high post earl
But I ain’t like most girls I like the best of both worlds
Hope ya comprehend cuz that’s the way I’m living

I said that’s gravy baby
Matter of fact I mean a privilege
I should have been to knowledge when you said you hang out in the village
Don’t underestimate things we can do
I can get bent up with you like one of my niggas in the crew
To many things you eliminate when you discriminate
Passing up the meal before you see what’s on the dinner plate
Vibe with me
And try to describe to me
What you’ve been deprived to see and what you want a man to be
Maybe I can teach you something about mankind
Cuz rubbing belly to belly pressing skin to skin
Bodies fucking like here one ain’t a damn thing going in?
Uh uh I know there’s got to be a better way
I ain't trying to let you get away
Preferably
High heels and tight dresses would be first nominee
But gangsta bitches never fear
I bone thugz in harmony
If we got the same taste maybe we can work together
Where’s your girlfriend because I’m down for whatever
And maybe we can be some sort of a three some
You me and she some
I’m feelin jack tripped up by myself

Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane
She said I ain’t the crew type
But I got a girl that you’d like
Right there a dime in carrot tights with the blue stripe
Remember her or not
Guess by now you forgot
But she said you hit it back when “get the job done” was hot
Oh word?
Aight so school her on a mission
Im wishing on her vision of becoming the third edition
Make her make the right decision towards this whole proposition
Listen this rendition involves a lot more than just kissing
Cuz I’m not the type to disturb the groove
Ill let you first make your move
Before I start operation smooth
Go ahead and getcha
Groove going in with her
Did I hitchya?
The only thing that’s missing from this picture
Shit have us looking like a game of twister
I ain’t got nothing against your sexual preference
If that’s the way you get down
Then that’s how you get down
But when you need the helping hand I’m around how that sound?

Now this is called the Wack Itt, and I do it all the time
Choose the wackest, wackest beats, and add the wackest, wackest rhymes
The wacky, wacky, wacky voice, which I really shouldn't say, is wacky
Some people say it's wack, but it's not, it's just cracky
This is how I do it, some people just can't hack it
If it's cold outside, then go on and put on a jacket
But now I'm here to tell you. and we know this for a fact
This record's just like crack, you know what it is? It's wack
Wack itt
I mean you're goin out the whole nine yards
Now I'm sittin in my room tryin to guess just what to do
So I decided to get wacky, cause you know, yo, that's true
So we turned on to a track that had to be super wack
And yo, guess what we came up - somethin like that
I was really thinkin about some things that make me mad
How could you get a gold record when you sound like J.J. Fad?
I mean come on, let's be for real, I mean I didn't wanna say it
But their shit was so wack, yo, this one I know you'll play it
It's record
A wacky record
Now just jump up and down, spin your head from left to right
Then just move a little bit, get real close, but not too tight
Let me see you throw your hands up in the air like you don't care
And that's called the wackest dance, and we'll call it the Underwear
It's a record
A wacky record
(Go on, girl)
Now my name is Shanté, not Wanda Wah-Wah
And I'm here to make a record, and some people say I'm a star
I say: Yeah, I do agree, but you have to think real close
I mean, when it comes to bein wacky, J.J. Fad, yo, they're the most
It's a wack itt
Wack itt, wack itt, wack itt...
Now if you want a example, let me tell you what makes me mad
Did you ever hear Supersonic that was by J.J. Fad?
Listen close to what I'm sayin, cause it went somethin like this
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la...)
Or you can say I missed, I really can't resist
To come to someone, up to their face. and then give them a diss
I do it all the time, everytime I say a rhyme
People jump, yeah, all on mines, cause you know they're out of line
I tell them to step right back, cause you know the record's wack
If you do not like the record, yo - I got it like that
I can make rhymes up just like this
Make the people not wanna resist
They listen to the beat and start to dance
And then they start to jump up in their pants
Now I told you how to do the dance
Get on the floor and take a chance
Now this is known as a matter of fact
Yo, stop the track, let's get wack
Wack
Wack
Wack
Wack

Yo yo
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
My ears
What you're doin, baby
Stop playin
Stop
Stop
Stop
My God
Wack itt, wack itt, wack it…
Ah-ha
Wack wack
Now sittin in my room tryin to guess just what to do
So I decided to get wacky, cause you know, yo, that's true
So we turned on to a track that had to be super wack
And yo, guess what we came up - somethin like that
Now get offa my tip
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Now who would believe...
See this - this here happens to be a fad or a faze or a style
That the party people happen to be going through
And I'm in this to win this
And I'm here to get paid, so I figured I might as well get wack too
I mean come on
They might even tell me that the record is
DYNAMITE!!!
Now wasn't that cute
But anyway
Wish I get some respect after this one
Wack itt

Wacky wack itt

Keep Your Eye On The Prize,"In Control, Volume 1 (2009 Special Double Disc Edition)",1988,"(feat. Master Ace)
To get where you wanna be
You have to set a goal
And keep your eyes on the prize
Yeah

Now let me take a second, just so I can beckon
And call out an all-out rush just like wreckin
Your brain as you strain to maintain, sustain
The way you felt because I dealt you pain
And pleasure, in every single measure
You miss being kissed by this lyrical treasure
Enjoy it at your leisure, cause it's gonna please ya
Master Ace and Action again is here to ease ya
Spirit, cause all you have to do is hear it
And you'll catch a stroke
And say, ""Damn, that brother broke!""
Now I'm about to get off another funky hit off
And if you think you're hangin, yo, I think you bit off
More than you can chew, now how you gonna swallow it?
Check the technique, see if you can follow it
Like a path or a road made of yellow bricks
Yo Steady Pace, go 'head and bust the mellow mix


So keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
And keep your eyes on the prize

Now I'm the capital A and what I'm sayin is conveyin
That I romp, stomp and jump on any competition
That's opposed to me, they can't get close to me
You say that goes to see, what's that supposed to be?
Some kind of challenge? I take you head up
Beat up and eat up punks and won't let up
But not with my fist or even with a deadly weapon
But with my lyrics, yeah, that's how I'm steppin
On all those that doubt me or my race is won
And you critics are hopin that the Ace is done
But now consider, this here little bit of
Super commentary for those that are very
Misdirected and lookin for some kinda angle
Censorship is their attempt to strangle
The Master, they know that my words can motivate
And set straight the crooked from their fate
Don't you understand that rap is like a tool to me
You're sellin what? You're actin likea fool to me
Go get a job or maybe go and learn a trade
And make the grade, that's how you get paid
Steady's on the cut and Action is the posse
Open your eyes and you'll see what I see
Brothers are fallin, homegirls are callin
Themselves independent, but yo, we're all in
The same boat together, it doesn't matter whether
You disagree, it's still reality - see


Now where're we goin, where are we goin, which direction?
Look at your reflection, now someone praise the resurrection
Of a people many years considered kin
To an animal, unlike those with lighter skin
But that's the past and many knew it couldn't last
By peaceful means or either by a rifle blast
Or whatever, better late than never
We finally arrived and yo, the dream has survived
But many died tryin and they're the ones that paved the way
Real live supermen and -women save the day
So that we can live our life without ?????
Racial oppression, mental anguish through aggression
So realize what it took for us to rise
And don't sleep but reap and keep your eyes on the prize


Sing a song of six pence, a pocket full of crack
Think you're sayin somethin, you ain't sayin jack
Now tell me, what is goin on these days?
From what I'm seein lately I'd say crime pays
Cause somebody is gettin paid
I think it's time to sprinkle some rain on the parade
Now listen, take this as a word from the wise
I'm not a prophet or a preacher, just a man with eyes
And I've been witnessed the fitness of a neighborhood worsen
You oughta hold a person-to-person
Discussion with those who rose from that level
Usin a broom or a mop or a shovel
Not on the corner waitin for the big pay-off
It's not comin, so why not stay off
The streets, believe me it beats bein sent up-
State on a date with the man and bein pinned up
In solitary, take advantage of your freedom
I'm givin helpful hands cause you need em
It's not all about the cash you make
Sellin poison to boys and girls - you're a fake
So what you got a cable, so what you got a BM?
You love when the girls go, ""Ooh, did you see him!""
So what your pocket's filled with 20s and 10s
You're gonna find out just how fast that ends
Cause one day you'll be drivin round the way in your ride
There'll be a bullet with your name on the side
And if you don't believe what I'm tellin you, mack
When you're layin on the ground with a hole in your back
Lookin up at the sky, gettin closer to hell
Just remember Master Ace had a story to tell
Yeah

(Chorus)
Keep control...
(Tragedy the Intelligent Hoodlum)
When I made arrest the president, America ate me
Spoke the truth that the gov't hates me
They labeled me a prejudice poet
I'm speaking the truth as I know it
I hold on but it's hard for me to handle
Too much lies, corruption and scandal
Cops want to kill a brother or two
Who do you call when the gang wears blue
I ain't going out like an Uncle Tom man
My gun is loaded and I'm itching to pull the trigger
I'm marking for death as a funky rhyme sayer
Corruption flows from the cops to the mayor
Mali troops will run through your resident
In my hand will be the head of your president
All you fess that made a check to throwdown
Will rise up for a political showdown
Chorus
(King Tee)
Yo, King Tee stepping in on a dark tip
Open your eyes and your mind and get a grip
Of the ropes and chains that kept us
Since we were black they didn't want to except us
But it's ok, I got my own plan
Cause yo, I ain't down wit your program
The natives cook, wash and clean
Until the rebel stepped on the scene
M-A-N-D-E-L-A
Now you got a chance to hear what he say
Since they kept him locked up for so long
Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong
But we need to all stand together though
And let the red, black and green show
Become aware of yourself before it gets too late
Another message from King Tee the great
Chorus
(Grand Puba)
Yo bust it
Hun did the flip, got a doobie wig
Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man does hits
Hun livin' lovely, Miss Gucci
Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends
Ugn, miss quick fast in a hurry
Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy
Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids
And the man caught a nice thick bid
Now the bitch is on skid
Screaming how she hates her kids
The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy
Think slick, she better get wit the WIC
Cause foul, foul, foul is your style
You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile
See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song
How long must this go on
Chorus
(Def Jef)
Power now or never, together forever
And ever, sever make it endever
To enlight your brother when
I recommend to extend a hand
Expand and then with strength defend
Black women and men from the white power structure
They sucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya
And you gave birth to a nation
Your free labor laid America's economic foundation
Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years
But now here’s what appears to be the shift in the gears
The turn of the tables, knowledge enables
Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels
And years of classroom fables, fiction
Fallacies, falsehoods, and fabrications
Facades, even fronts
Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts
Chorus
(Chubb Rock)
I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen
And knowing his father slowing
And his mother is hoeing
And now should he be growing
He's too young to be sewing
He should just chill and be flowing
I know he was being malested and sold
And his mom for being infected
Never check it, so I invested
My time and made sure little bro was looked at
Pops got evicted, bitch got a smack
Pumped his fists and being that I'm a pugilist
The bum got done by the one
And little Jeffery, no more tears left to drip
Mixed wit semen on his lip, emotional trip
It confuses and bent ill thoughts
In the soul of the youngster
Is daddy a monster
That raw creates lip sores and heartache pain
Dries and open your eyes for the insane

America eats the young
America eats the young
Yeah, Traged'
America eats the young
America eats the young
Yeah, come on

America eats the young, that's the title
Black-On-Black-Crime is suicidal
Racial outburst, killed in Bensonhurst
Now he's free in the universe
Killed the cop, he's unworthy
Murdered that poor black boy in Jersy
There's no sorrow, but you can borrow
America kills tommorrow
Get a grip and, time is slippin'
Howard Beach, Michael Griffin
To Halliburton, Larry Davis
These are the exemples America gave us
Pain inserter, Black converter
Mr. President, he's the murderer
Brothers waitin' for the Government to save them
Instead of usin' the minds the Lord gave them
High School drop out, now you clocked out ""come on""
Did a crime, got caught and you copped out
Incarcerated, you're just hate it
Made your bed, but you don't wanna lay in it
No probations, black and racin' ""come on""
My founation is the Nubian Nations ""let them know somethin""
Culture saker, political faker
Black raper, molder and maker ""Ugh""
Where is my mule and fourty eight acres? ""aiy""

Use your brain black men start thinkin' ""give it them""
I refuse to die 'til my job is done  ""give it them""

You used to look so good, but now you don't
You used to work, but now you won't
Scotty got your body cracked out
Got so high one day, you blacked out
Sold your body to an old white waiter
Had a friend, nine months later
Abused the child cause you hate every bit of him
Sayin' the saga that you shouldn't have got with him
You ain't no mother, you're a monster
Killed the youngster, put him in the duster
Sounded mournin, cold and swollen
Out of control and, your soul is rollin'
You played the keeps for life got stolen
Cracked the pain, killed your brain
Now you're criminally insane
The judge gave a sentence to outlive ya ""Hay""
Now you're beggin' for God to forgive ya ""come on""
In a cell, is where you dwell   ""that's right""
You scream and yell, you tried to hail
Grabbed the rope cause you choked on your last breath
The only way out is death
From the cell you hung, your body is swung
Now justice is done

America eats the young
America eats the young
That's right Traged', tell him
America eats the young
America eats the young
Eats its young
America eats the young
America eats the young

Yo Traged, show them why you're the 
Intelligent Hoodlum
Let them know somethin, come on now

Give a black man a badge and a gun and he thinks he is bigger
Ugh, he ain't nothin' but a sell out nigga
Pay him off and he'll pull the trigger ""come on""
Just to do me in, cause I'm a Nubian ""right, right""
First he pulled me in, then he cued me in
Lights of Islam, drop the bomb
It's Tragedy, not Uncle Tom

The Symphony (Marley’s Symphony Scratch),"In Control, Volume 1 (2009 Special Double Disc Edition)",1988,"(feat. Master Ace, Craig G, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane)

Listen closely, so your attention's undivided
Many in the past have tried to do what I did
Just the way I came off, man I'm gonna come off
Stronger and longer, even with the drum off
I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river
I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a
Little at a time, new trails are blazin'
Action is in effect, and always stays in
Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon
I am the man in charge and I've been plannin'
A jam strong enough that it can life your soul
I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold
Once you hear the capital ""A"" rap, it'll stay
With you for awhile, it won't go away
Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend
And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again
I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed
And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so
Or you'll be stranded, just like Caruso
Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye
A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I
Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone
Just for the record, let it be known
That my ego's only partially grown
And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm
That verse was the calm, now here's the storm...
Next up (Yo, I believe that's me). Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony

This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics
That though I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes
But that's alright, cuz now I'm back
To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me
Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to
But you jumped on hte tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew
You said, ""Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin?
Yo Craig, I head you in that jam, and it's pumpin'!
I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?""
That's how I'm livin': all surprise mode
Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed
Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken
I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is
To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience
Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me)
Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony...

Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice
And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price
Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep
And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep
When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like
And make the people unite
I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip
Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left
Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's deat
Makin' veterans run for medicine
Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than ConEdison
Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage
And if you want rage, I'm-a make front page
Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline
Your head is way past bedtime
Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow
My rap is rougher than Brillo
So fear me, don't dare dare me
And don't compare me to him when you hear me
Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war
Your metaphor sucks more than a whore
You can't replace me, ice me or ace me, bass me, face me, slice me or race me
Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force
My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce
Run for water while I break your tape recorder
Server-to-sucker: the order is manslaughter
Another rapper, G Rap wrecks, he's rated X, to mean the boy is sex. Next...
The amplifier gets used and abused. Pumps so loud, we might blow a fuse
This is anger, madness, ready to hang 'er
Rapper or singer: I'm puttin' up my middle finger
Next up... (I believe that's me)
Big Daddy Kane, get on the mic for the Symphony

Settin' it off, lettin' it off, beginnin'
Rough to the endin', you never been in
To move the groove with the smooth rap lord;
Like a bottle of juice, rhymes are being poured
Down your ear, crisp and clear
As I prepare to wear, tear and smear - then I'm outta here
With a mark left that you can all cling
Cuz rockin' a party? Yo, it's a small thing
I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces
That I'd been there and there at the party
The mic had my prints, and on it was a body
So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown
I'm takin' yours son
So just acknowledge the way that I kick it
Cuz if rap was a house, you'd be evicted
And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cuz Daddy's home
And battlin' me is hazardous to health
So put a quarter in your ass, cuz ya played yourself
Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid
I'm walkin' the path that Allah made
I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach
So just say when
So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet
My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it
The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger
Cuz when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga!
You've got the groove, MCs, freeze, stand still, nobody move
It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cuz gotdamn, I'm livin' large
Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit
You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it
I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya
No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate
As the great will dominate straight to the state
Of reignin', gainin. So put Kane in, that category. Period. End of story...",https://genius.com/Marley-marl-the-symphony-marleys-symphony-scratch-lyrics

Me and Marley Marl, we're goin one on one
For any sucker rapper that chooses to come

Why am I best in this profession?
Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo

I drop science as if I was Butterfingers
And I know there's not another singer
In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme

These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit
And sized perfectly, so that they can fit
You're steppin to us? You need traction
Or you'll be another sucker missin in action
You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it

Cheatin’ Days Are Over,"In Control, Vol. 2: For Your Steering Pleasure",UnKnown,"Verse 1
Al called me up about a quarter to six
Said Hey Nice, whats up with tricks
I got a cutie coming over, and she's bringing a friend
Why dont you keep her busy while I go and hit the skins
Now I know I wouldn't have called you if I knew you wouldn't do it
Besides she's cool and in an hour you can troop it
Thought to myself, I guess it sound cool
He said she had money was a scholar in school
I said OK cause see Al's my homie
Besides I don't front when it comes to tenderonies
Hung up the phone through on my dip wear
Had a half an hour before I had to be there
Got to his house he seemed surprised
Something was wrong and I could see it in his eyes
Stepped in the house and what did I see?
Her on a long couch sat Beauty and the Beast
Stepped to the cutie, Al said No
Trying not to laugh cause he knew it was her
He proceeded upstairs with the cutie on his arm
Said it with a smile, you can call that Yvonne
Chorus
My cheatin days are over 
Check it out
Verse 2
Well I told her my name, I didn't want to diss her
But I almost broke fool when she asked me to kiss her
I said lets leave take a ride or something
She said 100% I know a pump thats jumping
She took me to the Boonies, I met her friends and goonies
I saw a brother staring and growling looking loony
And Al told a lie see Vonne was broke
With a played out lease and that silver and gold rope
She must have got her hair on an ad on sale
Because she had a ballhead and with a pony tail
Man was I steaming just buying her drinks
Kept slamming them down everytime I blinked
She had a throat like a snake, hands like a rake
Eating and drinking, I had to put on her breaks
I said hey G you're getting hot on my collar
I'm not your damn mother and I'm sure not your father
If you bother with a man that's said he's had enough
You just might get snuffed
Chorus
Verse 3
After me digging and shooting the facts
She called me a bum I said I'm on to your trap
Since the night begins you've been burning more money
Now you're calling me a bum you know you're kin of funny
I think that you should wake up or use a different make up
You're really trying to play me and I'm really bout to smack up
Your grill kind of ill, hitting hard like Bruce Lee
I'm short like Spike Lee, Kick you in your right knee
Grab you round your neck stand you up on your feet
And take you out with the DDT
She was feeling real offended but I really didn't care
Called Al with the flavour then I drunk a few beers
I learned my lesson about trying to be your lover
That's why my cheating days are over

(Aw - there it is!)
(I've waited long enough)
Bust a move, let's play a little Simon Says
So take your places and listen to the rhymin as
I like display a new style that just may
Leave suckers runnin for the door in total dismay
Yeah, by now, so you're startin to
Get a little hype, but first get a partner
And proceed full speed right to the dance arena
I really doubt it, but maybe by chance you seen a-
Nother brother more inclined to play the part of Simon
Than the Master Ace who knows the art of rhymin
Like a shark knows the finer points of swimmin
Like Steady Pace know the cuts and the fly women
And so before we start this game
Simon says: get up, and yo, I do the same
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: look deep into your partner's eyes
(Let's play a little game)
Look at your partner from head to toe
(Let's play a little game)
And all those good parts in between, you know
(Let's play a little game)
Simon says: it gets badder, and you never had a
Beat that can heat your feet, and still add a
Theme with so much steam, it makes sweat pour
From your faces, and the Ace is sure
Gonna do it, as you listen to it
See, I navigate ya straight to help through it
I'm Simon, rhymin, climbin on time, and
On a mission, that's the position that I'm in
Takin you there, makin you care
I'm achin to tear up the floor, but I don't dare
Leave the mic sittin, gettin cold without my hand on
Those that dance don't have a foot to stand on
And those that don't dance, yo, you oughta know
Simon says: wall flowers aren't allowed to grow
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: close your eyes
And imagine your partner totally unclothed
(Let's play a little game)
Nude, in the butt, bare to the flesh
Now get as close as you can to your partner
And without touching him, move your body to the rhythm
(Let's play a little game)
Simon takes the stand, just as planned
And I display in a ray that's rather grand
Now I agree, there are many who said 'party's off'
But if one of them says, he drops arty soft
See to drop hard you must have the kind of mind
That's refined and artistically lined
Cause yo, it takes nack if you wanna attack
Attract with such skill, and still fit the bill
Ace and Action, few can come harder
Than we come, uhm - here's some, but only part of
The gift that can lift the myth that is swift
Only boast the most, yo, Simon says: if
If your partner's face is in place with your taste
Then haste, you better push up, no time to waste
So if you're with it, you better get it, don't try to sit it
On a chair and stare like a square, brother, quit it
There's no time for nerds and geeks, only freaks
With the sexy cheeks, as the Master speaks
And for weeks and weeks you will dance and prance
To the rhythm I enhance with my chants
So here's a glance at a jam that'll nullify
And fry all the rest, bust the color
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, in the gold and violet
This jam is fly, and I'm the pilot
Flyin you straight to the end of the rainbow
Steady and I try to open your brain, so
You can accept what was carefully kept
Till the fun stops, then the party was pepped
Up, and if you stepped up, you couldn't hold your place in a chair
So hail Simon, the brother Master Ace in the rear
Simon says: yeeeaah...
(Let's play a little game)
Now Simon says: put your right hand on your partner's shoulder
And put your left hand on your partner's waist
(Let's play a little game)
Now move your hips rhythmatically
(Let's play a little game)
Now the climax...
Simon says: touch your partner's body
Touch your partner's body
In every way imaginable
Yeah
Do the nasty
(Let's play a little game)
I wanna say what's up to my DJ Steady Pace
Sha-Born the technician
Ray for real
Eye-Cu Rock and the rest of the Action Posse
Special thanks to DJ Marley Marl
And Tim Westwood rockin things out in U.K
(Okay, I'm loosin up now)
Peace, world

Buffalo Soldier (feat. MC Amazing),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me, it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlock Rasta was the Buffalo Soldier
And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Buffalo Soldier, in the heart of America
If you know your history
Then you would know where you coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the heck do I think I am
I'm just a Buffalo Soldier
In the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival
Fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the war for America
Dreadie, woe yoe yoe, woe yoe yoe
Woe yoe yoe, ya ya woe yo, woe yoe yoe
(repeat)
Buffalo Soldier, trodding through the land
Said he wanna ran, then you wanna hand
Trodding through the land, yea, yea
Sais he was a Buffalo Soldier
Win the was for America
Buffalo Soldier, Dreadlock Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland
To the heart of the Caribbean
Singing, woe yoe yoe, woe woe yoe yoe
Woe yow yoe yo, yo yo woe yo yoe
(repeat)
Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding hrough Jamaica , A Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, Fighting for survival

It's Shan's what I'm called, I stand tall and brave
And me and Marley Marl is as close as a shave
My rhymes lock jaw like a pitbull bite
Suckers always try to sleep on me cause I look light
See, a lotta wack rappers try to rack their brains
To feel a style of MC, come on, break these chains
Speak now or hold your peace when I decide to pass it
But every rhyme you ever had could never surpass this
If rhymes were food, the main source for livin
You would swear that every line of my rhyme was thanksgiving
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, give me my freedom

I wanna break away clean, I mean virtually spotless
And all year long I been schemin and plottin this
If beats were cakes, then my rhymes'd get frosted
This is '88 and I still ain't lost it
For all of those who still got a doubt in their mind
There ain't a rapper livin bad enough to take mine
There ain't no studio-illusion and no scratch-syncin
Stop - if that's what you're thinkin
Write rhymes simultaneously, say em in pairs
And I would hate to have a rapper proclaim it theirs
Instead in comin in a limo, bring a casket and hearse
Before we speak we'll hear the preacher from the deacon first
We won't be gathered that day to unite no couple up
Marley, are we gettin this on tape? (Yup)
All you dirty low-down better slow down faster
Your technique isn't good enough to hang with the master
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I dont need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my, give me my, give me my freedom

I'm the opposite of what you say a slob is
Dumpin suckers off is exactly what my job is
I'm feared like Napoleon and blessed like Buddah
You couldn't face me solo, you'd have to bring your crew to
Dump me off, I don't recollect the mumble
I ain't soft, homeboy, and picture me crumble
And forget all of those that don't like my rap
I don't be kickin that old shooby-dooby-doo-wop crap
Rappers often brag about their bitin deejay
But they can't do Marley nothin, no how, so hey
It's clear to the ear what I'm sayin, son
That's why we feel like slaves on the freedom run
And each and every time a wack rapper walks by me
His head starts singin: Come on and fly me...
I don't bite styles, weak rhymes, I don't need em
Stop jockin me, boy, jockin me, son, jockin me, punk
Jockin me, kid, give me my freedom

We can do this like Brutus, I'm not mad, I'm pissed
This parade of mine I doubt that you can rain on this
You couldn't place my rhymes amongst mortal men
When I be rhymin on beats that set the hip-hop trend
I will always exist because I'm bein preserved
Don't agree to set me free, then you gotta be served
I earned a name amongst society as lyrically ill
But yet I'm loyal, see, cause marley hooks the beat up still
There's no way that you could say there's a day I'd fess
Hamana-hamana-nothin, you can kill that mess
My rhymes are ruthless, no heart, and totally wretched
And if they was to fall down then the beats would catch it

Keep Your Eye on the Prize (feat. Master Ace),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Master Ace)
To get where you wanna be
You have to set a goal
And keep your eyes on the prize
Yeah

Now let me take a second, just so I can beckon
And call out an all-out rush just like wreckin
Your brain as you strain to maintain, sustain
The way you felt because I dealt you pain
And pleasure, in every single measure
You miss being kissed by this lyrical treasure
Enjoy it at your leisure, cause it's gonna please ya
Master Ace and Action again is here to ease ya
Spirit, cause all you have to do is hear it
And you'll catch a stroke
And say, ""Damn, that brother broke!""
Now I'm about to get off another funky hit off
And if you think you're hangin, yo, I think you bit off
More than you can chew, now how you gonna swallow it?
Check the technique, see if you can follow it
Like a path or a road made of yellow bricks
Yo Steady Pace, go 'head and bust the mellow mix


So keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
Keep your eyes on the prize
And keep your eyes on the prize

Now I'm the capital A and what I'm sayin is conveyin
That I romp, stomp and jump on any competition
That's opposed to me, they can't get close to me
You say that goes to see, what's that supposed to be?
Some kind of challenge? I take you head up
Beat up and eat up punks and won't let up
But not with my fist or even with a deadly weapon
But with my lyrics, yeah, that's how I'm steppin
On all those that doubt me or my race is won
And you critics are hopin that the Ace is done
But now consider, this here little bit of
Super commentary for those that are very
Misdirected and lookin for some kinda angle
Censorship is their attempt to strangle
The Master, they know that my words can motivate
And set straight the crooked from their fate
Don't you understand that rap is like a tool to me
You're sellin what? You're actin likea fool to me
Go get a job or maybe go and learn a trade
And make the grade, that's how you get paid
Steady's on the cut and Action is the posse
Open your eyes and you'll see what I see
Brothers are fallin, homegirls are callin
Themselves independent, but yo, we're all in
The same boat together, it doesn't matter whether
You disagree, it's still reality - see


Now where're we goin, where are we goin, which direction?
Look at your reflection, now someone praise the resurrection
Of a people many years considered kin
To an animal, unlike those with lighter skin
But that's the past and many knew it couldn't last
By peaceful means or either by a rifle blast
Or whatever, better late than never
We finally arrived and yo, the dream has survived
But many died tryin and they're the ones that paved the way
Real live supermen and -women save the day
So that we can live our life without ?????
Racial oppression, mental anguish through aggression
So realize what it took for us to rise
And don't sleep but reap and keep your eyes on the prize


Sing a song of six pence, a pocket full of crack
Think you're sayin somethin, you ain't sayin jack
Now tell me, what is goin on these days?
From what I'm seein lately I'd say crime pays
Cause somebody is gettin paid
I think it's time to sprinkle some rain on the parade
Now listen, take this as a word from the wise
I'm not a prophet or a preacher, just a man with eyes
And I've been witnessed the fitness of a neighborhood worsen
You oughta hold a person-to-person
Discussion with those who rose from that level
Usin a broom or a mop or a shovel
Not on the corner waitin for the big pay-off
It's not comin, so why not stay off
The streets, believe me it beats bein sent up-
State on a date with the man and bein pinned up
In solitary, take advantage of your freedom
I'm givin helpful hands cause you need em
It's not all about the cash you make
Sellin poison to boys and girls - you're a fake
So what you got a cable, so what you got a BM?
You love when the girls go, ""Ooh, did you see him!""
So what your pocket's filled with 20s and 10s
You're gonna find out just how fast that ends
Cause one day you'll be drivin round the way in your ride
There'll be a bullet with your name on the side
And if you don't believe what I'm tellin you, mack
When you're layin on the ground with a hole in your back
Lookin up at the sky, gettin closer to hell
Just remember Master Ace had a story to tell
Yeah
Yo

Or is it cause the 44 right there
Now you like oh oh yeah

Pay attention class the lyrics and beats so clear
They speak on it but never in the streets nowhere
If they wanna get raw
Bro they scream no fair

The victory is almost there
Its like we oh so near
But the object is to show no fear
So when I do this here
Some of you just stare
Others criticize, others act like you don't care
But someday oh you'll be there
Yes you'll be there

He's mad cause me and Chris are controlling your fans
As far as hip-hop
We the ones holding the plans
He made the Blueprint
For Christ's sake you know he's the man
Craig G, yah you know me
I'll smoke at the chance
Watch the flames go out
You better grab ahold of a hand
Say the wrong thing
I'll be 44'n your man
Get it mushy
Turn his body parts to dough where he stands
No DNA evidence, not a hair strand
Back in the bank account

There was cats from Brooklyn up there

There was cats coming from the Bronx
They had rap tapes

Used to all (?) at lunchtime
Like that's kind of hot right there
Break down tapes

Grandmaster Flash tapes, Furious Five tapes
You know
All them battle tapes
We used to check it out
It was all love you know
I said yo, I'm living in Queens
These cats living out there
You know what I'm saying
There was cats living uptown
I said yo let me do my thing in Queens
Know what I'm saying
I like where that's coming from right there
I started doing my thing
You know I got the Sure Shot crew
Up in the projects
You know we did (?) up in the (?) center
You know you had to pay before you entered
It was real like that
Know what I'm saying
But a lot of cats had to come though Queensbridge
To show how tight they was with hip hop
Bambaata came to Queensbridge
We had Grandmaster Flash back in the day
You know what I'm saying
Show & AG, everybody that was popping at the time
Treacherous, you know they had to come through Queensbridge
You know
They say like yo we travelled outside the Bronx
We did our thing so we can rock Queensbridge
So it was like an honor for anybody to come through there and rock Queensbridge

Yo it's like, it's like
Way back as the 60's came through
It was a little rock 'n roll era
Little R&B era came through
Know what I'm saying?
The 70's created a little disco era
So, you now it was time for a change
And that's when
Like the end of the 80's that's when hip hop came through
You know
Now that's when it made its mark
And then from there on
This went on into the 90's
Hip hop still prevailed
Now we're here in the 2000's
Hip hop is prevailing for like thirty joints
You know
Its like a lot of things change and move on
But we're just building stronger
It's like a snowball coming down the mountain
It's like getting bigger faster
Bigger, faster

Marley Marl Scratch (dub),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. MC Shan)


All these beats and my rhymes attached
Form the new creation called the Marley Scratch
We're always steered in a positive course
His beats, my rhymes, combined make force
I say it's like a force cos the force is strong
And if you think we're weak I'd say you're wrong
All you other DJ's are a bunch of jerks
Marley give 'em an example how a DJ works

Since you just heard how a DJ sound
The name Marley Marl, I will break it down
The M is for Master of Scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
The A is a letter that you set apart
I wouldn't call his beats music, I would call it Art
The R just stands for the way he Rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock
The L is for Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sounds out of sight
The E is for Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
Don't play with the Y cos it isn't a game
You ax ""Why do you put the other DJ's to shame?""
After this there shouldn't be a story to tell

Marley, can we hear your funky fresh scratchin' again?

I never got caught in the game of Tag
My name is MC Shan, no need to brag
MC's brag about theirself all through their rhyme
You can see I got quality, won't waste my time
If I did not mean it, I wouldn't have said it
I'm gonna give the man behind the wheels some credit
I'm not tryna say that he can't be beat
But Marley Marl can stand on his own two feet
Since a DJ like him is so in demand
Marley won't you get on and show 'em where you stand

He can go on but I won't insist
How many fortunate MC's have a DJ like this
Every time I grab the mic I always have a plan
He's DJ Marley Marl and I am MC Shan
Combined we're fresh, this you must admit
Don't ever wanna hear you say we ain't worth jack
To be a DJ or an MC well it isn't no thing
If you ever wanna learn then just give us a ring
Like I just said, it wasn't no thing
You either have to be a ace, a jack, a queen or a king
When you're one of these, that means you're the best
And the people of today won't settle for less
We can be a jack or king, we can play the place
But we'd rather be a DJ and an MC ace

If you ever wanna battle, be at your best
Because a man like Marley just does not fess
In that battle you must give your all
Or just be prepared to take your fall
Cos a lotta DJ's already tried
There ain't been one yet that's qualified
To think you can beat him, you must be nuts
Just listen real close to his scratchin' cuts

The man Marley Marl can bring you to tears
He's not a new jack, he been down for years
On the two turntables I would say he's nice
Every cut he makes is so precise
When I said precise inside my rhyme
To put it to you straight that means right on time
Every jam he throws he always rocked
Don't refer to him as the neighbourhood jock
To all you DJ's who are always fessin'
From this man you can learn a lesson
You heard Dimples D when she took her stand
She said (Marley Marl is one hell of a man)
..
Gotta get it off my chest, to put my mind at ease
Since when you heard a DJ make cuts like these",https://genius.com/Marley-marl-marley-marl-scratch-dub-lyrics

Hip Hop History #3,Hip Hop Dictionary,2000.0,"There's an international language called hip hop
You know what I'm saying
Its like
I could go to any part of the world
And if there's anybody that's into hip hop
We can communicate without words into that point
You know why
Because we are connected through this international
International language called hip hop
You know I believe if
If it was ever wartime or something like that
If somebody heard hip hop playing in the distance
From any side that was doing any warring
Against each other
And they heard hip hop in the night
All through the trees and through the mountains
I be that they would make their way there
And they would have something in common
You know
I think hip hop, its going to save the world
Its like, its the only international language
That's really crossing the boundaries of everything else
You know its pulling people together
That don't even speak the same language
That never, that never really
That never really knew the same thing in their life
Now think about their ancestors
They never really had anything in common
But, you know
You go into this year 2000 that will be better right
And there's this international language called hip hop
That's just
Crossing all boundaries, and races, and creeds, and colors, and (?)
Hip hop its like, its so international at this point man
It makes people that don't have anything in their life ever in common
Have this one common thing in common you know
And they got this love for this game
This international game called hip hop
Its like
It just makes me so ridiculously happy to be, you know
A part of something
That's real

Cause for real there was a time you know
The beat was the most essential part
No for real
The beat was the most essential part of the track
Then, then we would pick up the other pieces
But yo that's then and there though so yo
So when Peter, you know Peter told me
Yo, yo, Marley let's get involved with this beat generation series
I'm like yo the beat generation

When I get stupid to the point that I'm mentally mad
My rhymes start to flow, so I simply must brag
About my style that makes you vibrant, I keep drivin
Until the song turns me to a hip-hop giant
Me and Marley Marl, we're goin one on one
For any sucker rapper that chooses to come
And for me Craig G a/k/a The Kingpin
I drop science, can't you tell how I'm singing?
They hate how I tie my mic cord to a whip
Suckers just have to flip cause I'm so hip
Craig G and Marley Marl, we form the ultimate alliance
No sucker can deal when I'm droppin science
(Get)
(Get)
(Get funky)
I'm droppin science

Rappers: Ask yourself the same question
Why am I best in this profession?
Is it because you're scared to step to me, yo
Or the things Marley does in the studio?
I drop science as if I was Butterfingers
And I know there's not another singer
In this lifetime to kick the right rhyme
Cause there's not another rhyme quite like mine
And when it comes to havin showmanship
I really don't care who you go and get
Cause rappers hate me, I'm so defiant
And I can get stupid just by droppin science
(Get)
(Get)
(Get funky)
I'm droppin science

Livin larger than life, and what this means is
We'll be the dopest duo comin outta Queensbridge
Now crews hate us cause we're extraordinaire
For you to beat us? Hm, I think that's sort of rare
These rhymes are dope, that's how I transmit
And sized perfectly, so that they can fit
You're steppin to us? You need traction
Or you'll be another sucker missin in action
You hate to hear it? You'll learn to love it
My smokin rhymes, you always think of it
I eat MC's up like a pack of hungry lions
So step out my way, I'm droppin science
(Get)

I'm droppin science

The Vernon Posse along with me Craig G
Is gonna rock it till the crowd begs me
To kick the next verse, your context's worse
Like all the others, that's why I get respect first
And believe me, I'm never on on others
Cause as a member of Cold Chillin'/Warner Brothers
I do swear to uphold this
Title of rap to be the boldest
Among so many MC's
Yo Marley, yo we outta here?

Hip Hop History #2,Hip Hop Dictionary,2000.0,"Hip Hop evolves from
Coming, you know straight out of the park you know
Cats used to like plug up in the street lights in the street
Run the extension cords across the street
You know what I'm saying?
And make it rock
You know?
Came outside with PA systems
You know barely having sound systems
Like, PA systems
Unmatched turntables
Not even mixers, you know what I'm saying?
(?) speakers with no bass
Screaming the sound of hip hop
Coming straight out, you know?
Its like crazy man to see what it is right now
You know?
Its like, its like a million dollar thing right now
Started from one plug in one park
One light, one future
