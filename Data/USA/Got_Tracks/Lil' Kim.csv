Black Friday,Black Friday,2011.0,"It’s funny ‘cause, you know, we’ve been asking people what they wanted to know
I mean, clearly, you’ve been having this thing with Kim
And I don’t know, just thinking about you and where you were from and that you’re a rapper –
And I’m thinking, sure, I know things have gotten crazy and people are assuming -
Even though you say it’s not specifically about her - that Roman’s Revenge is for Kim
Umm, you know, she just really jumped out the window, and you gotta be careful when you pick fights
And that's what I've learned in this business, you just never know –
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

Who the fuck want war?
Fed Ex beef straight to your front door
It will be a murder scene
I'm turnin' Pink Friday into Friday the 13th
A'ight you Lil' Kim clone clown
All this buffoonery, this shit stops now
Time for you to lay down, I'm sick of the frauds
I put hands on this bitch like a spa massage
We all know your last name is what got you your job
You a put together gimmick, something like a collage
Since you puttin on a show, you gon get the applause
Clap, clap, lift ya frame like a fucking garage?
This hood shit you and Drake ain't built for
This the shit this other bitch almost got killed for
I still counting what Hardcore generated
Bet my shit keeps spinning like its syndicated
Corny broad I'll leave you bloody like you menstruated
You hot air ass bitch, should have been deflated
This ain't a championship fight I been the greatest
See the fact is what you doing... I did it
Lames trying to clone my style and run with it
Thats cool. I was the first one with it
Yous a Lil' Kim wanna be, You just hate to admit it
I'm the blueprint, You ain't nothing brand new
Check ya posters and videos, You will always be number 2
I seen them come. I seen them go. Still I remain
Sweety you on your 14th minute of fame
Im over 10 year strong still running the game
Cut the comparison, I'm in the legendary lane
Fighting for a spot... Child please I'm solidified
With my hands tied, you couldn't beat me if you bitches tried
Either you high or sippin that shit Wayne on
I get top dollar for whatever my name on
Go stick your head in a tornado- Brainstorm
I drop bombs- Flex, Napalms
Black and yellow, we'll pull up in your ghetto
Giuseppes when I step out, posted up in stilettos
Pussy so pink like my kitty sayin hello
If I whistle they'll pistol whip you in all 5 boroughs
I'm from Brooklyn I be everywhere comfortably
Now who pumped you and told you to come romp with me?
You the type to run your mouth and then run from me
I'm poppin off in your hood with no company
C'mon, Queens ain't showin you no love
I was there the other night poppin bottles with the thugs
You like Washington heffa I'm Benji
You got a buzz right now, I had a frenzy
Oh yeah welcome to the fam Fendi
You need to stop, you're not hot you're a burning match
That means the end is near soon, copy that?
Oh I see they really got you gassed, like I'm a thing of the past
Betta slow down dummy, you about to crash
Stank pussy ho, I'm givin you a bath
Thermometer in hand and I'm comin for ya ass
Who you think you gettin past?
I see right through you, your whole shit is made of glass


I draw back
I'm a Brooklyn thorough bitch, rep for my borough bitch
Never been the type to have beef and try to settle shit
I ride out til the wheels fall off
And my niggas squeeze til the last shell go off
Fuck your whole team all I see is a bunch of wierdos
You'sa airhead bitch- scarecrow
Ain't nothin old but my money bitch
This is grown liquid assets
Benjamin's my daddy you Young Money bastards
You and Diddy- sorry bunch of swagger jackers
I mothered you hoes I should claim you on my income taxes
Bobby Fischer in the flesh, taught by the great
So on my next move I'm yellin' checkmate
I smell a massacre
I'm Charles Manson, you don't stand a chance with her
Jeffrey Dahmer and you lookin like lunch to me
Bout to kill all you bitches like Ted Bundy
Leave your whole head red like Pegg Bundy
You're hilarious... thanks for all the laughs
You're garbage, so I'm takin out the trash
You? Shit on me?
C'mon baby girl- Ain't enough ass shots in the world
You're a nuisance, you'd probably steal my new shit
But you could never fuck with me
So chuck it up deuces
All around the world I ball like a ball team
I stack chips, call me Miss Rothstein
Tricks is for kids silly rabbit you're my offspring
Kim more anticipated than a Lebron ring

""I mean I know... I know you guys asked me if Roman’s Revenge was about Kim...
And no, I, it’s not about Kim...
Actually if Kim thought it was about her, I’m so sorry
I’m so sorry, I apologize, Kim
I don’t know, I just had temporary insanity... I lost my teeth and my mind...""",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-black-friday-lyrics
Queen Bitch,Hard Core,1996.0,"If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A., you wanna be 'em
Most of y'all niggas can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch, on and on, on and on

Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch! Uhh
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch
Shit I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-queen-bitch-lyrics

That's how many times I wanna cum, twenty-one
And another one, and another one, and another one
24-karats, nigga
That's when I'm fuckin' with the average nigga
Work the shaft, brothers be battin' me, and oh
Don'tcha like the way I roll
And play with my bushy
Tell me what's on your mind when your tongue's in the pussy

Twist you backwards, get the dough from your platinum hits
Rock Lil' Kim hats and shit
I gets down and dirty for the dough
I got love and B.I.G. know it
He must got the studio bugged
Probably, as we speak he's on his way up the street
With the M.A.F.I.A. thugs and all types of heat

Threw me at high priced Beam's
Face on TV's, platinum CD's
Shit, I never faught

Stack the g's up, keeps the knees up
What the fuck, stay fillin', half a mill'n
Geneva Diva, yeah, I throws it down
Lay around, clown the clock stops for no one
Never 68 and owe 1, takes one to know one
Better off wit the

Push the keys, G's threes for pape's

Lieutenant takes mad dimes from New York to Anaheim
While you daydream and whine,

#MINE,Lil Kim Season,2016.0,"Don't mind you looking at it
I don't mind people looking at it
Don't get mad if she ain't looking back at you nigga
Don't get mad if she ain't looking back at you nigga

Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe
Firearm, we roll around in the streets
When I get home it's going down in the sheets
Don't mind you looking cause she's mine girl, she a big fine girl
Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grinder

You know how we be moving
Me and Kevin Gates
I'm a star and I'ma keep shining
Like the roof on the Wraith
Eat my pussy with his breakfast
'Cause he love the way it tastes
He said that I stay on his mind
How I be sitting on his face
I don't need nothing but bread
I don't need niggas for nothing but head
They all fantasize being with Kim
Every night, I'm laying right next to him
Fuck my ex, you make me wetter
Fabulous, you make me better
Chanel sneakers, Chanel leather
Chanel bag in Chanel weather
Hundred grand on that PRG
I don't hear what no peon say
See me with him, just know that's me
Ten carats scream fiance
See my pussy print all through my jeans
I know you watch all this ass behind me
Should be watchin' this nigga that's right beside me

Every time she whine, she move her body like a spider
And everybody watching all that ass she got behind her
Moneymaker shine but I don't mind 'cause I'ma grinder

You know how we be moving, listening to Future, Pluto
People like us take over, I'm a shooter with a shooter
Says she down here from up north, college, she commuting
She my new professor, I'm learning, I'm a student
Her momma hate me, say I'm too advanced, ask her how she's doing
She never say it to my face, I'm turnt up I'm a movie, yeah
At night she hear her daughter scream, Cassius Clay, I boom bye yae
My hand around her throat she naked, I bent her over on the dresser
It's too gangsta how I'm dressin', beat the pussy up, no question
Pull her hair ho, you for Kevin, hair red or blonde, or whatever
I-I'm caressin' on her breastes, kissing on her, you a blessin'
Knew I loved her when I met her, she love me, you looking for her

Don't mind you looking cause she mine girl, she for me
Fall off, she gon' hold it down, please believe

Grabbed my neck and now I'm choking on it
Hold it down if you go to prison
Conversate, conjugal visits
Keep our love, I got the COD
I'mma hold it down like P.O.P
That dope pussy that chronic
That DRE, so don't OD
Hold up baby, come here, give it to me
I'm about to uh huh, lick the pussy
In the car, don't give a fuck who lookin'
And stroking on it
, hustle through this for you
Dick her full, don't know if you

Say it ain't come here on a muscle
Lot of spit when you humming on it
Legs shaking now you cumming on it
Quiet babe, power coming on it
Uber coming, now you going home
I know it's difficult dealing
With a nigga that's in my profession
Hold up babe, why you in your feelings?
Break it for me, gotta tell your nigga
""Fly a kite"" Michael Jackson, thriller
You say, ""Don't nobody keep it realer""
Real one, I homicide 
the vision
Say her name, they gon' get the business
Chris Brown, playing when I killed her
He could fuck you too cause that's my nigga
Hand cuffin' pussy, I ain't with it
She could be for you and treat her special
Yeah, she say she love me, you looking for her

How Many Licks?,The Notorious K.I.M.,2000.0,"Hold up, so what you're saying is
(Niggas got me pissed like Lil' Kim)
You want to get freaky again, aight
A-ooh-ah-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a 
Queen Bee Rules
 tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

This verse goes out to my niggas in jail
Beatin' they dicks to the double-X-L magazine (uhh)
You like how I look in the aqua green? Get your Vaseline
Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!
Jailer, open up cell, block eight
Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard
Hotter than a Pop Tart fresh out of the toaster
Niggas do anything for a 
Lil' Kim poster
Eses, 
Bloods
, 
Crips
, all the thugs
Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

If you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the 
Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street
, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste
, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
('Cause I've got to know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
So, how many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Tell me, let me know)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?
(Oh, oh)
How many licks does it take 'til you get to the center of the?

Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps

Not Tonight,Hard Core,1996.0,"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, ""rockin' the mic""
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin'""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
""I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,"" screamin'

I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-not-tonight-lyrics

To all my motherfuckin' gettin' money hoes

And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Comin' through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch

Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never comin' home
Kim got 'em in the zone, beatin' they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbin' their tits
What? I'm lovin' this shit, Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?

With no strings attached, yeah nigga, picture that
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us, no doubt
Ay yo, yo, yo, come here so I can bust in ya mouth

Ay yo, come here, bitch

And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick

No, no, no, no
All I wanna do is get my pussy sucked (Nigga!)
Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y
The BX, the chron-chron 
and the list goes on and on
(On and on and on) like Erykah Badu
Once he drink 
the Remy
 down, ooh, I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him I said what came to mind
Like niggas be doin' yeah baby, I love you long time
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya, I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick

I'ma keep it real, for the dough I might kill
I'm tryna see my face on a hunnid dolla bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this 
Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said 'Whoa! Who's the other guy?'
Hope you know you payin' extra for 
this fuckin' third eye
Something about him
, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth 'Fool, Give me my money!'
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none

Ay yo, come here, bitch
Nigga, fuck you!
No, fuck you, bitch
Who you talkin' to?
Why you actin' like a bitch?
'Cause y'all niggas ain't shit
And if I was dude I'd tell y'all to suck my dick",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-suck-my-dick-lyrics

Lighters Up,The Naked Truth,2005.0,"I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Feds get clap too
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind 'cause we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the 
concrete jungle
The strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
It's the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after

Now put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up (New York)
Put your lighters up (D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up (Philadelphia)
Put your lighters up (Detroit)
Put your lighters up (Chi-Town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

Now, let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
'Cause people is talking
The streets is watching
The D's is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustler
The life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggas than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn don't run, we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We don't play that
Out in BK, not at all
Gor a pound leave your face on the wall
R.I.P. in memory of
Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn

Now put your lighters up (L.A.)
Put your lighters up (V.A.)
Put your lighters up (Texas)
Keep putting your lighters up (New Orleans)

And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it, bartender you can give me one more

And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more

And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more

Fuck it, bartender you can give me one more

See, BIG done told you
I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you don't understand it
Then let me give it to you in Spanish
Soy la señorita más linda del barrios
Y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil sipping Moscato
You must of forgot though
So I'mma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12-year-olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution
There's no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you don't know my town is the truth

Put your lighters up (Boston)
Put your lighters up (B'more)

Put your lighters up (Puerto Rico)
Put your lighters up (Kingston, Jamaica)

In the lady frame
Leavin' cum stains, niggas remain in awe
When I brought a Derringer, throw it to ya jaw, uh
Never a flaw
Never before have you seen such magnificence in the black princess, yes
Flow's phenom, I'm the bomb-diggity, ask Biggie
Keep a dedicated squad with me, call us the Gabbana girls
We dangerous, bitches pay a fee just to hang with us
Trust, niggas lust
Without a bank account, I doubt we could swing that route
Feel me out, uh, I'm used ta’
Hangin’ with boosters, in the best name brand
With the insane clan
Man, listen
My position is lieutenant
Like a block of hash, got the burners up in it, percent it
I send it back to ya’ greasy
Freak it Arabic style, Sharmoota elhas teeze
To please me you got to be well off
Bust a shell off, with a tattoo that starts off

Bitches be lyin' bout the clothes they be buyin'
Some stores won't even let you whores in
'Til I begin to embarrass that ass and get crass
Kim surpass all crews
Bitches still drinkin' booze
I sip Cristal and Landcruise
Receive all the “ooohs” and the “ahhhs”, the jewels and the cars
Slick nigga, I'm stickin' you, Baby Pah, uh
Yes indeed, flows first class and yours is coach like the bag
The Prada mama
Jog five miles a day, then I hit the sauna
My girls rock Chanel and smoke mad marijuana

Damn ma’, I love you like the lah, the ganja

Inhale this, clench your fist
Then ya’, feel the mist through the uterus
Can ya’, picture this?
Life without me, wake up you're having bad dreams
Cause ya’ fiend for a toke
My crew tote Tocques and mink coats
On the cell with the boat
What you thought?
We get caught and get bailed out?
Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessy on the rocks is all we got as we sail out
Entrepreneurs, Cristal pourers, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring, huh? I'm warnin' ya’
Style waits for no bitch, I dream rich
When I fuck with scratch and sniff
Now I stacks the shit, practice it
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous
So I can relax a bit, and get my toes licked

I missed you, too
I waited a long time for this
So why you ain't come see me, no commissary or nothin'?
I ain't wanna see my bird in no cage
But I'm ready to take care of you now
Now, after three years?
Three motherfuckin' years, nigga? You know what?

Hasta la vista, bye-bye, kiss your kids
It's the gangstresses
What you think this is, nigga?
Calm yourself, it's just a little robbery
You got stricken with the poverty, starvin' me
Call me Sunshine, pussy spread like the rainbow
Spectaculous, miraculous
I practice this for a livin', like the Buddhism
Nam myoho renge kyo
Ask Tina, love ain't got shit to do, with me and you
Or the .44 under the pillow with the dildo
I like to play while I'm workin'
And that's for certain
Keep jerkin', I ain't done with you
Lights, cameras, curtains
In a second
The show begins
Invite your family and friends
They gotta see this
Oh, they wouldn't believe this
You got stuck and left naked with a hard penis

It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough

I heard about the carjacks and all the contracts
Out on me by your man Big D
Stink Gucara, I bought his life for 3 G's
Then some watches, then wet him like galoshes
No need to be mad, they already gone
Him and your hitman had somethin' goin' on
We caught him down at the Shark Bar up in Mark's car
You know the place where the willies are
Always frontin' in they Morays, sippin' Dom P's and Cristies
I reminisce how it used to be
On the run from po-lice we bust shotties out of Maseratis
Bloody bodies in the telly lobbies
When in need I lied for ya, I cried for ya
You know this down-ass bitch woulda died for ya
I used to sweat you, but now forget you
I'd rather dead you, and wet you like I never met you

It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough

And I remember, how you said you loved me
With a passion
High fashion
Who you askin'?
To keep the tum numb, from index to thumb
Push the V's with the coke from the DT's
Dope take the titties from city to city
I ain't see a G off none of them ki's
At ease, when the cops came you gave them my name
Said if I didn't snitch, you'd make a shorty rich, bitch
I copped the one to three just to see
If all the yayo and boy carryin' on the Peter Pan & Maryland
Was worth the bitch marryin'
This nigga I so worked so hard for
Chose my life to be hardcore
Laws didn`t appeal no more
Gats I couldn't feel no more
And now I'm the shit
Go by the name of Lil' Kim, the Queen Bitch
And M.A.F.I.A.'s the clique
Instead of playin' Don Dinero
I shoulda been scheming on your cream and dinero
It don't pay to be nice, but it's nice to pay
And if you die before you wake, may your soul God take

It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe
It don't take nothin' for you to love me
If you're feelin' like I do, then I know you want it, too
It don't take nothin' for you to spend a little dough
It don't take nothin' for you to love me, babe

No matter what people say

Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh
Depending on how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites never gettin' into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes

True, if I was you I'd hate me too
Louis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze
Every other week a different dude and other crews
I make offers nobody can refuse
You might even see me on the channel nine news
I get paid just for laying in the shade
To take pictures with a glass of lemonade
My rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade

Wake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid
Wanted me so bad you ain't copped or bootleg
Y'all niggas played like a high top fade
Some of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played
Y'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it
I rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it
My fam deep with security in the jeep
When the Queen come in town everything shut down

No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)

Breakdown, uh
Let's dance come on
Let's dance come on
I see you, let's go
Yeah, Queen Bee, do it like this

I'm the highest, your highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speakin' so that 'ju know
*Rakim* ""This is how it should be done..
'Cause this style, is identical to none""
The hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip-hop a ya don't stop
To rock it to the bang-bang boogie
To up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat
Now what you hear is not a fake
It's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)
Now I know y'all heard other females rap
But they ain't got nothin' on me
'Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best
A hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)
So to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind
In fact I'ma give it to y'all one more time like..

Uh yeah, what?
Come on, bounce, what?

No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that, baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think

Aunt Dot,The Notorious K.I.M.,2000.0,"[Verse 1: Lil' Kim & 
Lil' Shanice
]
My Aunt Dot
Left a Glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
Even though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece
Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
What? She don't know I like my guns pretty?
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies
I heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you?
Whattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?
She called me by my government name, Kimberly
Who sent you?
My mom sent me; her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie
Hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack, 
with the hat to match
Bvlgari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
And I could see she was admiring my mink ski suit
Then she handed me the note
Here, read this
I just stared her up and down
'Cause I couldn't believe this, then I opened it
It said, ""Bitches is out to get you
Your so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz
I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends
They know where you live, so evacuate the crib
And oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice
Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her
Besides she looks up to you, you're her idol
And tomorrow is her first violin recital
And she would be, more than happy if you could take her
Peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later""
Damn, what went wrong?
Can't we all just get along, and make hit songs?
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show, y'all hoes would get ""gonged""
'Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
What the fuck you waitin' for? C'mon, let's get it on
What? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future
To bring back your head like 
Medusa

Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)
[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & 
Lil' Shanice
]
Uhh, we in the Range in this fucked up weather
It's snowin' and I'm tryin' to put the whole shit together
How Laverne, she always wanted to be like me
And dress like me, and look like me
And Nicole, it's like she lived in my house
Askin me for money, day in - day out
And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha
C'mon Shanice I'm takin' you to my house in L. Conn
(I wanna go with you!) Uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine
C'mon please, I wanna be just like you
600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barettes and
H-class rocks inside my Baby G Shock
Fuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes, X-and-O's
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'R'Us
Make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
I'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-C-the-E
But all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what? I like the green, know what I mean?
Ever seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I can clean
You know what? I like you, little big person
But rule number one, no cursin'
Anyway, what you know about that?
You too young for that, when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
So she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
""Hello?"" Yo, what's the deal?
Why these bitches buggin' out;
I mean, what's this all about?
""
See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They don't want you to win no more
Soul Train they don't want you to attend no more
And I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
The other day, when I was comin' out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door""
For real? ""Yup, then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat
Then I dumped her on a dead-end street
The other two? Yeah they still linger
But don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
So just pray I come home
And when we hang up, get rid of your phone""
Whoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
It's like five 
Bloody Mary's
, one after another
Hmmph, she have you stressed, 
no wearin' white, no sex
And when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
'Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
Is the reason why the story is to be continued

Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts (I'm killin' ya)
Girls be actin' stink, and mad funny
Y'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""

Live from NYC, it's Q.B
The heavyweight champ, female MC
Girls say they different but uh see
In all actuality, they wanna be me
This chick running around with this stink ass gap
And them fake ass raps having panic attacks
You ain't a star
And your record company know that
How you make all this money, get this far and blow it
I'm a businesswoman now so I'm not concerned
I'd bet on Lil' Cease before you and your Firm
If this was back in the days I would've been snatched you
I'm getting money now
Them bitches in the hood they can have you
Stop paying these niggas to write y'all shit
For the right cream I'd write a hot sixteen
Better be careful what you say to me
That same shit you shit
I'ma make you sniff

Bum ass nigga don't even know how to bust a gun ass nigga
You dumb ass nigga
Rappers acting out the late Frank White's path
Once they get in jail they get fucked in the ass
Never snitch, never send a nigga to jail
I'd rather find him by a boat doing the deadman's float
We gangsters
Real gangsters b
Gun in the green room up at BET

Kill you and cut the head off your babysitter

And I've got nine hundred and ninety-nine votes
You got nine hundred and ninety-nine nopes
You local bitch I'm worldwide
Can't you see? Open your eyes

Dope bitch, fresh up out the pot nigga
Versace Cavalli all on my crotch nigga

Pussy taste like pineapple Circoc nigga
Take him to the bank, make him cash out
Cash cow, milk him til' he max out
Made him eat the pussy till he passed out

Been in love with benji since the fifth grade
Role play, dress up like a french maid
Uh, I got your nigga tweakin' ho

Why she got her nosed fixed, why she got bigger tits
Why is y'all on my shit damn - SHUT UP BITCH!!!!

Everybody talkin', all these haters hawkin'
Paparazzi stalkin' takin' pictures while I'm walkin'
Damn can't a bitch breathe, gimmie room please
I'm in the paper e'ry day if I piss or sneeze
I used to ride in a rental Lebaron
Now you can catch me in the SLR Mercedes McLaren (Hey Kim what up)
Gotta put the doors up, haters pick ya jaws up
I'm in the Trump International
, 
30 floors up (so high)
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'
(Get it jumpin' bitch)
Used to talk about the way I wore my clothes
Now every chick look like Lil' Kim in they videos

I hate that people starin' cause this chick stay appearin'
In somethin' made with German enginerin', rack-n-pinion steerin'
Homes with french doors and heated marble floors
Whores heated cause Momma back and hotter than before
Big bank, hold rank like the late Frank
I does what you can't, I'm everythin' that you ain't
I'm La Bella Don, the biggest bitch in the biz
So dont hate me nigga, it is what it is
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'

I just keep climbing up the ladder, y'all never stop my swagger
All this petty chitter-chatter only make my packets fatter
Some peoples jobs just to talk about Lil' Kim
Let's face it, I'm a way of life for all of them
Tabloid magazines rate worst and best dressed
They got some nerve when the ones who do the ratings look a mess
Star Jones don't like me, she cheap and I like the best
Damn, it must feel good to Payless
You ain't payin' my bills, so you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ain't keepin' it real then you need to stop frontin'
You say you got this but we don't see nothin'
And people if you feel me get this whole shit jumpin'
You know niggas hate to see another nigga eat
Quick to put another niggas business in the street
I wish they'd shut the fuck up, damn good grief
You know your mouth's a cage for your tongue if you just close your teeth

I heard she mad rich, I heard she dead broke
I heard she sniffin' coke - SHUT UP BITCH!!!!
Ayo Kim can spit, man she don't write her shit
Nah Biggie wrote her shit - SHUT UP BITCH!!!!

Man get off my girl's shit - SHUT UP BITCH!!!!

Haha I know it's killin' you bitches, I know it's killin' you
She's back, oh my God
You had a voodoo doll and everything, worthless bitch
You just knew, 'Don't let her come back Jesus, please don't let her come back'
But she's back bitches
Haha, okay look, just, on the count of three
Stop focusing on her and think about you for a second
Now ain't that depressing, ain't it depressin'
See, that's why don't nobody talk about you
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Get yourself a hobby bitch, learn how to make a quilt or sumin'
Ha, is it really that you hate you?

They say the closest ones to ya
Be the ones that sneak up behind ya and stick the knife through ya
That's why now I keep my friends to a minimum
Check for the ones wit the venom on they tongue
'Cuz niggas is snakes, they hugs be fake
Steal from they best friend at his own wake
I did all I can do and I took all I can take
This is it, crossin' me was ya biggest mistake
And was it enough that I split 20% of what I make?
Was it enough that I cut niggas half of what I bake?
Ain't enough that I almost lost all my bread
Bailin niggas out, keepin' a roof over our head
Enough is enough I wash my hands I'm done wit it
I ain't playin wit u motherfuckers come wit it
Keep the fam together God knows I tried
But shit ain't been the same since B.I. died

Lil' Kim the first rap bitch to shake up the charts
Act like I ain't the leader of this Million Bitch March
Who got y'all rockin' the Prada
The Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Versace and Louis
Please, I'm the reason this rap game is unisex
I'm the reason bitches want bigger breasts
Show some respect where respect is due
(Without who?) Without me there'd be no you
These next few lines it to you women abusers
Last nigga I was wit... straight fuckin' loser
Niggas think 'cuz you give 'em ya heart
They can... dissect it and rip it apart
Mm-mm, not I, one nigga's in my eye
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy
You lost a good bitch nigga you can't front
Lil' Kim is EVERYthing a man could EVER want
And that's real

I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day... and every night

I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day, yo... every night
Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy

When the... money is gone (So is ya friends)
When the... gas runs out (there goes ya Benz)
They just don't make my breed no more
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more
I don't deal wit the nonsense, I'm keepin' it real
Wanna do business wit me? Get in touch wit Hill

That's right any questions? No you can't ask me
Put ya name and ya number on a letterhead and fax me
U want Kim? Name the location
75 grand and that's just for conversation

I'mma remain loyal while y'all crumble like the foil
It's tradition to rock diamonds in my crown, I'm royal
Niggas ain't believe in me, they thought it was over
Baby girl risin' up like the early mornin' sun
Y'all think y'all know but y'all have no idea
What the fuck I been goin' through these last 7 years

Every day, yo... and every night
They just don't make my breed no more

(I pray for love) I'm the last of the Mohicans...
(and every night) after me
There will be none... (I pray for love...)
(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)... and every night
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more

I'm sayin... I just wanna be happy, that's all I don't ask for much
It makes me happy to see my people smile you know what I'm sayin
I ain't a hater, I don't even like sayin' the word
(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more)
I'd sacrifice everything I got right now to have my man Biggie here wit me
You see that's just how I am
'Cuz I'm a rider (Keep the fam together god knows I tried)
What good is it to have everything
If you can't share it with the one you love?
If you can't be wit the ones you love... then love the ones you wit
Don't take nobody for granted
You ain't promised tomorrow
Karma's a motherfucker
I'm appreciative (Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy)

After me there will be none, but you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as, Lil Kim the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole family stay up

This time around I ain't takin no shit, this time around I never get bit
This time around I switched up my flow
Got rid of the pits and put rotts by the do'
This time around it ain't like befo'
This time around I'm gon' crack ya jaw
The feds is watchin me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene my favorite color is green
I'm buildin a empire got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win
Made my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me
Music's my first love a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me Lil Kim come through
My fans across the world I came back for you

I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

It's the real hip hop mami check the facts
I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya
Come back, to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down

I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

This time around either your in or your out
This time around you better watch your mouth
This time around you gon' hang or bang
This time around you better do your thang
Cause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain't no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army y'all can't harm me
If the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve me
Don't get your life tooken I know I got you shooken

Hold On,The Notorious K.I.M.,2000.0,"Oh, how it hurts, like childbirth
The wounds heal slow, you just don't know
At times, I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray, day to day
But still, I feel my strength might die
Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
Damn, I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry B.I., I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas, caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration
But just when I'm about to quit, God tells me to just

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

Frank White, the man with the money and the fame
Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me, I know exactly what you're going through

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better
I got your back

So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
We miss you so much, I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy, but we fakin'
And to New York, thanks for the support
And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight

I'm crushin' these bitches like it's a Wednesday
Skrt skrt, that what the Wraith do
Inside whited out, I just erased you
Outside all black, it's biracial
I'm married to the money and I'm so faithful
Man, this ring finger so icy (icy)
It's like my middle finger don't fuck with it (fuck y'all niggas)
These red bottoms so spicy (spicy)
It's like there's red pepper stuck to the bottom of 'em

Pull up in the dawn, spicy

They hate me, I see why, I'm so icy
When Kim come through, they get spicy
You know my niggas be, spicy

You bitches ain't spicy, y'all just salty

You drippin' wack juice, boy, it's not sauce
Stop hypin' up these goofies and wack rhymers
Your dick suckin' done got worse than Blac Chyna
Spice out the cabinet aka the closet
I'm makin' up some fly shit, I'm makin' a deposit
Remember we was playin' we gon' make it in the projects
To get that off white you gotta make it from the Pyrex
Now I'm into cayenne, drippin' sriracha
Tell a nigga stay cool 'fore we turn up in hot shit, nigga
Get some bangin' head, then amnesia on 'em
Should I plain jane or add the seasonin' on em'?
Kimmy

Stand behind Martin Luther King, but I'm more like Malcolm X
Guerillas beatin on they chest, get it right on Malcolm X
Just keep the peace, cause if cowards show me disrespect
My niggas put his soul to rest and I don't wanna see you stressed

In the jail jumpsuit, still a bad bitch though
Rose from the ghetto it was hard from the get go
Then I showed the hood the world ain't just made for rich folk
Get'cha little dance up,

Straight to the dancefloor, everybody hands up
Throw it up, get down, fellas hold your pants up

Identity Theft,Hard Core 2K14,2014.0,"I get a feeling there's gonna be a riot...

Uh, it's looking like I'm headed back behind bars again
Cause bitches wanna start with Kim and I ain't with the arguing
I'm jet chartering, fresh cardigan
Getting my Martha in while these broke hoes borrowing
I guess it's back to stashing guns in the bra again
Pulling bitches out they car again
These swagger jackers give the game a bad look
Pop shit on Twitter and apologize on Facebook
And now they wanna send me requests
Telling me that I'm simply the best
I won't stop till I see my enemies rest
They probably get locked up for identity theft
I ain't got time for bum bitches, the gun get it
I come with it, anything you tryna do, I done did it
I'll let you live for a while but I'm dying with the crown

All I see is the streets when we back out
Took us a break but we back now
Back in this bitch with a bag now
Sour niggas stay hatin' on us
And the bitter bitches, got 'em mad now

Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Countin' on, 20s, 50s and these 100s, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby
Ain't nothin' more important than this money, baby

Landin' jets at the border
Rolls Royce is my taxi to the hotels on the water
Quarter mill when I'm layin', nigga
Killin' 'em slow, that's torture
Rented out the whole top floor penthouse just for my daughter
You broke bitches outta order
I'm a bad bitch with some ol' money
Yeah, I'm ballin' but I want some mo' money
Pop the Lamborghini in the living room
Elevated to the master room
My rooftop got a rooftop
Bomb pussy, that's a boombox
Buscemi this, Givenchy that
Spent a rack on some Gucci tube socks
In Dubai I'm skiin' in the summer
Surfin' waves in the winter time
They callin' me the young gunner
The way I body these jeans is such a crime
They got a love-hate type-a thang for me

Got bigger fish to fry
Eat you so called sharks at dinner time

Givin' y'all my old clothes
My old flows, like hand-me-downs
I see y'all watchin' my Snap
Tryna see what else you could jack
100 grand with the cheese in the trap
Better catch me a rat
All this weight, I need a lap band
Pussy nigga give a lap dance

Homosexuals, dykes, intellectuals like my flow, my charm
Wifey on the arm and stay fucking other bitches
Style never switches
Inhale, exhale, bail Nino Brown out
For shootin' up a townhouse in Hempstead, kids fled
Rumors was dead, no beef with no cliques

Lexus GS's, chicks in iceberg dresses

Stop me from having marble faucets and gold toilets
I force it down your throat like sodomy; mama proud of me
'Cause I stopped killing niggas for free

The Anne Klein sportin', coke snortin', niggas lovely
I keep my pussy Fresh like Doug E., watch the show
As my flow bubble over like Mo's and Cristal's
Ain't scared to bust my pist-al, sippin' hard on Cristal
Dream accounts, large amounts
'Cause Frank don't play with lye money, get high money
Ready to die Grady, no if's, and's, or maybe's
I'm not your average lady; put that on my 380
Me and my bitch catch flights to Texas

Bump into some hoes that be in Houston boostin'
Trunk full of Donna Karan in the rental LeBaron
Uh, who us?
We just swervin', in the dark blue Suburban
Drinking Bourbon, with Heinekens for the chaser
Police'll never chase us we too fly for that
Processed and fingerprinted we too dime for that
I be, flirtin' for certain, wearing short skirts and
But ain't no dicks insertin' see, that's the difference
Between me and other bitches, they fuck to get they riches
I fuck to bust a nut, Lil' Kim not a slut
I gotta reputation to look out for
Plus my boss is a outlaw

Uhhh, motherfuckers think they tough guys
Motherfuckers better hold hands stepping up
Faggot ass motherfuckers
They really ain't no true players

Death comes to those that oppose the clique
Dick-riders get off the dick
'Cause, Larceny got guns for y'all
And if I get bagged my lawyers got tons of ones for y'all
Catching cases, niggas pull they macs out
Niggas getting mad 'cause I dug they backs out
Then I blacks out, start shooting kids
Cribs is vicious, making my escape jumping bridges
Malicious, sometimes the danger taste delicious
Rule number three; don't take love from no bitches
You know what makes me much stronger than you
I can take pain much longer than you

""Fuck Lil' Kim"", bitch, watch your mouth before they can't ID you
Laid up in ICU where nobody can come see you
Why these bitches think they safe because I'm not out?
You know any given time Kimmy could pop out
Every time I see these chicks they quick to cop out
IG got these hoes thinkin' that they got clout (Ahh)
Get yo' ass back in that house, we got No Limit tanks
Master P dropped that shit off last night, we pullin' rank
Never talk when gangstas talk unless you 'bout that action
My track record'll tell you bitches I ain't just rappin'
This Dior coat is the only one, so you can't jack it
I'm a masterpiece, wrapped me on his arm like a bust-down Patek
Niggas flexin' on the 'Gram, but they be broke (They be broke)
Smokin' on 'em blunts, but don't want no smoke
Never care so much right now, my paper's stackin' up (Stackin' up)
I'm in my Louis bag, you hoes could pack it up (Pack it up)
Y'all both got knocked, he in, you out, it ain't adding up (Ain't addin' up)
But you say you keep it gangsta, nigga, that's cap or what? (Cap or what?)
Big and Pac'd be alive right now if you niggas ain't gassed shit up
If I knew who did it, I'd personally wrap they caskets up
I'ma keep Frank name alive, my nigga ain't die for nothin'
Got shooters out in Brooklyn ready to die for nothin'
These rats runnin' round in this jungle, lyin' for nothin'
Be careful we got apes out here, eat you alive for nothin'

We on our Royal Fam shit, you heard?
Thank you, come again

So I'm about to get on some Left Eye shit
And start burnin' down niggas cribs

When we met, I can't front, I was all in your shit
Even though I was a bitch playin' hard to get
'Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me 'bout them broads you was fuckin in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And ""Heartbreaker"" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)

Breakfast in Paris, dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach, yeah we had it goin' on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years, and now you wanna dump me?
And just to think, I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin said she was havin' one too?
You wrong! Nigga dead wrong, you know the song
""Don't know what you've got til it's gone""
After the fight, the other night, and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up, I was ""Waiting to Exhale""

Got you lookin' in the mirror sayin', ""Damn!""
Sick thinkin bout the next man fuckin this tight pussy
Niggas want me, even though they got a honey
If I'ma be number two, they givin' me some hush money
Ask Whitney, I learned how to break a heart from you
Cause when a woman's fed up, it ain't nothin' you can do

M.A.F.I.A. Land,Hard Core,1996.0,"Yeah, uhh
In the M.A.F.I.A.'s land, y'all
Where loyalty is everything
The M.A.F.I.A. forgives, but never forgets
Heh, let me tell you

In the M.A.F.I.A.'s land where there's one boss and one clan
Yes mans, they surround us like steaks in pans
All 'em wanna be the man, right hands wash the left hands
Loyalty's priority in this fam
Where life's initiated, ain't no givin' it back
Once you in it, like Bennett, you'll soon be lieutenant
Like me, the Don Juan, that's Yvonne
The sweat-a the money getter
Coppin' mad cheddar
Stevie was Wondering how I got in this position
One day Frank was fishin' for competition, expedition
Number one, his name is Barry Madanno
Push the phat Milano, '96 stick-shift 'cross the Verrazano
I lay gently in the Bentley, through binoculars he seemed popular
Givenchy socks, Cartier coolats
H-class rocks and charms like Bohemians
Sick like leukemians, receding hairlines
Watch how genuine this gold mine recline
When Frank pops the wine, I cocks the nine
Niggas peeped it from behind and slipped they clips in quick
One chick named Nick thought she was the shit
Tried to play Big Poppa, don't worry
Minutes before I drop her, the *blow! blow! blow!*
Like a parolee, the bitch violated
So how you like it: coffins or cremated?

It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas

Street murderers, thug parasites
We official, no fake gators
Coppin' firearms with dud missles
We leavin' scar tissues
That nigga Barry still aggy about that slut
Mob nigga, what! threw the gang sign up
The nigga chuckles, just slip the loot
On my belt buckles and cracked his middle knuckles
Damn! How could a deal for a couple mill
Result to such violence
And throw our whole shit off balance?
But still, they pat me down from all angles
Trapped inside the Devil's triangle
Like Bo I had the Jangles
And movin' slow to slide up on these Mexicans
One cross-eyed and hunchbacked
The other must be mixed with Black
The third nigga had missin' teeth and tattoo teardrops
Long hair, chest felt like a bag of rocks
Before this chops
I grabbed the keys to locks, the jewels and the rocks
The cream in the box, et cetera, et cetera, and it don't stop
I got away with everything, the cash and the stash

It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas

So now I'm titled, mission accomplished
My man was astonished
He looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air
Stinkin! I know this nigga's thinkin'
""Damn! She too little, too pretty, too quiet
The bitch is hired,"" mob's wife for life
Diamond heist with Trife, contracts on your life
We increase the price, uhh
So guess who the bitch is?
But for now I be the mistress

It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas
It ain't a day of my life that rolls by
That I don't get high, sit back, and wan' cry
I used to roll hard with tons of bitches
Now, it's just me and my niggas",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-mafia-land-lyrics

It ain't trafficking unless its 20 mil'
I wack a nigga and I'm down to do the bid (Boss)

Coogi sweaters, Jesus pieces, gotta do it big (Uh)

Niggas want the smoke, I hop out with the cig
I'll wack a nigga, then buy a flight to Madrid

I ain't the type to brag, I let that paper boast
Then I wash the dirty money in that ivory coast

Quarter milli' this year on shoes
Give a broke bitch the blues

May the Bishop pray for you 'cause you know I got the juice
We bet it big at the crap table, seven eleven
Open like we 7/11, workin' all night, 24/7
Fuck the FBI, I only confess to the reverend
Put that on my bredrin

Yes sir, I'm still hardcore
Numero uno, but you know a bitch'll still draw for her
My fans want an encore
Beach house overseas, that's the meaning of a north shore

You a atheist, I’ll make you a believer
Mink dragging on the floor, I'm sayin' fuck PETA like Tara and Amina

Do you see what I see, can you hear what I hear?
All these studio gangsters, year after year
With these gimicks I can't take it, they ain't real so they fakin' it
How did they make it in this game for so long?
I know what's right from what's wrong, I know what's soft from what's hard
I know a federal case from a publicity charge
Man I fought tooth and nail to keep them punks out of jail
But hoes wanna go to court 'til I pay them for their nails
Who you tryin' to be? Man, it couldn't be me
My man spent guap and bought me my Continental T
You spent your advance on your Continental T
I know you sick when you clean your rims you still see a Bee
And we see you a liar, tryna deny her
Jackie O. proved you far from a fighter
Comin' at me bitch, you playin' with fire
I ain't gon' come back at you, I'm comin' at your ghostwriters

It's the ones that befriend you that turn up against you
In the court of law and drop a dime like Sprint do
Supposed to be tough, huh? 'Til them boys touch ya
Chump muh'fuckers start confessin like Usher
I cut you off 'cause I knew I couldn't trust ya
Lame ass busters, backwards-ass hustlers
You fake phony, you always was lil' homey
Big lil' son baby' boy like Jody
I put you under my wing, bought you your first Roley
Nigga I helped raised you, why would I play you?

When them shells start poppin', bodies start droppin'

You see it always be them ones talkin' this and that
How they knife game ill and they gun go clap
Them niggas rats, they run and they trap
'Til they run in a trap, and there's no comin' back
It be the same ones talkin' 'bout the guns they sparkin'
The dogs never bite but do a whole lotta barkin'
A whole lotta growlin' 'til the wolves start howlin'
They pitbull shit, man them niggas straight cowards
Got 'em scared to death, pissin' in they trousers
Always was a bitch that's why I sent his ass flowers
Thanks to the queen he can share 'em with his team
You can run top speed but you can't dodge the

Don't be fooled and deceived, everythin' ain't what it seems
You act like you don't know what side of town this realer

Them niggas that was talkin' they won't run they mouth
When them shells start poppin', bodies start droppin'

Bobby Bone in De'niro, a Versace bag

12's in the trunk, Bruce Lee kick in the rear
Smoking out the inside like fog in the mirror

Can’t Fuck With Queen Bee,La Bella Mafia,2003.0,"It's a new day
And all you gossipin backstabbin habitual haters
You're all history (hissss-to-ry)
So you can hate, or hail the Queen (all hail, the Queen)
But it don't matter (but it don't matter)
Cause you ain't got nuttin, for us (you ain't got nothin.. for us)
So as long as you live, remember this

You can't fuck with Queen Bee.. Queen Bee.. Queen Bee!
All you haters will see.. see.. see!

Don't be mad, I can't put this - money in a casket
I can't put these - cars in a box with the ashes
I can't take these diamonds with me when I die
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you, would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you, hate dyin - but you gon' die a hater
I got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
Y'all nearsighted, lotta y'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light - baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green - don't know whether to stop or go
I'm a chameleon, I got many styles of rhymes
Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time
From ""Hardcore"" to ""Notorious"" you studied my flow

What is she like, what does she need?
What is her type, I wanna give it to her, tell her please
Be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires, in this whole world

Just cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich, but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck..

Catch a body, get a face lift, disappear like Pablo
Ya'll niggas think I won't jump in the heap
Well let's dance, you lames are finished
I serve all ya'll cowards like a game of tennis
Act like you want some of this and I'll give you the business
You see the yellow and black, you know what it's about
Wrinkled assed niggas gets ironed, to straighten you out
I got thugs in the east, thugs in the south
That'll stick you with an aids needle and piss in your mouth
I kept 'em on a leash and now it's time to let 'em out
Better pray to Jehovah, the game is over
Don't ever, ever, ever, ever underestimate

Ride outta town with my nigga, holdin' his weight
After it's cooked, chopped in eights the size of plates
You bitches ain't been through shit, you just minors
What you know about stuffin' half a bricks in your vagina
It's the dick licker, it's the baby sipper
Ain't a bitch alive can make a nigga cum quicker
Baby girl's pussy get wetter than a shower cap
Got my mans back like a Jansport napsack
And Queen Bee gon' bring you nothin' but heat
Homicide is lookin' for me for killin' these beats
You in the wrong department, this the upperclass section
You hoes is startin' to irritate me like a yeast infection
Good heavens, somebody get the Monostat 7
And hit me why don'tcha, hit me why don'tcha
The boss lady, I hold it down for my badies
Rappers better run and hide cause here comes the Beehive

It's your boy, Money Cash, I get love in the streets
Breathin' dro colored Benz's with dutch colored seats
Lay in the crib on Tuesdays, duckin' the sweep
Nigga jump off, then get pumped off your feet
I'm like Rostein, low key and brilliant with numbers
I'm tryna blow sticky in Brazil with the Hummer
If you spittin' and I'm grippin' this tech
Then that's 32 shots, our throwback's like Mitchell and Ness
Man, I'm a project nigga, still piss on the steps
And keep the brim on my fitted a little twist to the left
I play the block, fifth in my sweats, reppin' my set

I was OT in Mass, pushin' flower for months
Sprinklin' gun powder, oughta put a haze on my blunt
I spit a hundred and fifty bars when I'm blazin' 'em out

Forget a hotel, I'm fuckin' shorty right on the couch
Any rap shit I ever barked on, to hot to handle
And my rims bigger than lower Manhattan manholes

Stash box hold guns like Afgan soldiers
Wanna murda 16, well we the niggas you call
Queen Bee and Gotti Kids, muthafuck all ya'll


Uh, yo Vee The Kid, that's the name I earned in the streets
Cause my bars so hot, it be burnin' the beats
Melt my pen, I have slugs meltin' your chin
When I throw you over the bridge, they helpin' you swim
And you better wear a metal hat when you rappin' on stage
Or have my bullets like e-mail, packin' your waves
Or snatch your face off like I'm Nicolas Cage
And it could be five of ya'll, puttin' eight in your grave
Cause niggas think they hard, but they softer than bread
When them shells hit your throat, you be coughin' up lead
The next step is to off you, dead
I'mma cut your fuckin' head off and have Kim auction your head (Beehive)
See the kid don't rap for love, I rap for cheques
Even if I know you, I demand respect
And if I put you in the body bag, your man is next
The Advakid and Queen Bee gon' leave the game in a mess (Beehive)


It's young Goldie, the Advakid, put you to rest
I ride around with two 38's tucked in my sweats
A pump in trunk and a nine under the seat
Enough ammo to blow the earth from under your feet (Beehive)
And we got cake for killas like Hyde and Jeckyl
Snippers put red dots on your face like freckles
Don't make me have to reach for the lead
You'll think the bullets was rain drops how they all hit your head
I'm that slim kid that they say is probably hot
She only with me cause of what she think I probably got
Am I gon' be with her for long, probably not
Unless you're cute and suck a dick like a lollipop
Niggas talk about guns and they just bust caps
Niggas talk aboit ki's whey they just flip packs
When it come to my money, suggest you gimmie that

And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick

Will the court please rise?
Judge Funk Doctor Spock residing
Your honor, Lil' Kim is a threat to society
She has shown a blatant disregard for the law
And has killed six fine law enforcement agents in the line of duty
For the vicious acts, she should be punished to the fullest extent of the law

Pardon me your honor, may I address the bench?
They tryna assassinate me like they did to 
Larry Flynt
Excuse my persona
I may be hardcore but I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer
Ever since I killed 'em, I ain't been in trouble since
It wasn't my fault, I acted out of self-defense
He killed my best friend (Who's him?) I mean them
They was all dressed in blue and they want me dead too
They had real grenade bombs inside of their palms
And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was 
getting my ass licked
 by this cat named Tom
(Stop!) I heard three guns cocked, that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top
(Oh, she's lying!) Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor
Fingerprints all on the door, need I say more?
Pulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow, ploom!
Queen off her toes, they fell down like dominoes
I think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix
What was I to do? Sit back and just take this?
Yo, I'm tellin' you now If I lose this debate
Like in Dead Presidents I'm going out like Larenz Tate
See I ain't gon be stupid, I'ma take all y'all to the shift
I should be able to say what I want, what the fuck I plead the fifth?

I got to save the world
The first female king and they mad 'cause I'm a girl

Uh, with all due respect your honor
Excuse my client's temperament
Who has had social intelligence?
With so much innocence we have to implement
She was slightly out of place
But if you grant us a grain of your grace
I'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case
Imagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes
The same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose
Your children, your lovely wife, I mean look at her
The only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter

Lord I cry (I cry) from the things I've seen (that I've seen)

You'd know why I cry, I cry, I cry
(Order! Order! Order!
Order! Order! Order!)

Order in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts
And the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort
The men dressed in blue, they were undercover cops
Hungry to see another black motherfucker shot
They ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders
Even Tom was tapped with a mic and a tape recorder
(He was in on it too!)
Yeah
(I guess I should've known)
Yeah

I know I'm the judge
But I love that bitch
And I'm coming with her
Creme of crop, and me, I'ma hold her down
Resign with A-K's so we blowing the trial
Look it's a setup

I warn you, when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me wanna fight you, I ain't nothin' like you

The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots
People fuck to my music, they say it's pornographic
My Billboards is nice, one day gon' be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with members only jackets
That sleep on brass beds with money for a mattress
Gettin'-money bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the picture of a dime

Yo, yo yo yo, this joint is strictly for heavyweighters
Not them playa haters, nahmsayin?
Cause in the Commission, you ask for permission to hit em, uhh

My man Blake flew me to the Erie Lakes
Introduced me to this heavyweight, called hisself Drake
First mistake, Jesus piece was fake
But wait, he got singles in his cake; I ain't fuckin with him
Number one rule, always keep your cool, even though
You ain't a fool, and you see right through the nigga, how he figure?
If he holdin less than six
He gonna get the seven digits or visit, numbers in my Wizard?
Duke ain't even worth the space
Glass shoes and igloos put him dead in his place
Damn Blake, can't tell this cat is a snake?
I got 20/20 vision (Uhh) funny money vision (Uh-huh)
No dough, no show, dodo, that's a no-no
Just some famous words from the late Frank White
I blink right, if your bank tight
Duke wanted me to work for him, even flirt for him
Wear a short skirt for him, he don't know
I'ma end up hurtin him at the end of the day (Uh)
Shit, I got bills to pay, and it ain't my fault
If money talk and bullshit walk, round one

I'm in love wit ta mon, nearly twice my age
I want to give it up anyway, because it more pay
More time, more money, have it your way
I'm in love wit ta mon, nearly twice my age
I want to give it up anyway, because it more pay
More time, more money, have it your way

Know de money and the lovin is my style
Me a forget it tonight

Mmm... uhh, UHH, uhh, uhh
The play starts at 8:00, let's hit the venue
Invited his man, and some bitch named Kendall
Tried to style on 'em, shoes with the crocodile on it
But the nigga still was corny, he bore me
His preference was more sorta like soccer
Me, I do operas with the Mali and the vodka
Out in Cali gettin proper, and I, betcha fifty
My whole commitee stay shitty ask Smitty with the Desert E's
One glance at the bezzy make ya freeze
Please, I got a mil on these, whatchu talkin? I
Hate this nigga in the worst way
And I didn't wanna be here in the first place
But uhh, it's just vendetta for my man
Do anything for the fam, I'mma go along with the plan
Tryin hard not to throw him off
And I know he soft, when I cough, it's to cover up a lie
And the lie keep me full of empathy
So when I shit on this nigga, he gon' still pamper me
I see (I see), this nigga ain't about nothin', cause he keep frontin'
He must be up to somethin, round em up, here I come
Uhhh

I'm in love wit ta mon, nearly twice my age
I want to give it up anyway, because it more pay
More time, more money, have it your way
I'm in love wit ta mon, nearly twice my age
I want to give it up anyway, because it more pay
More time, more money, have it your way

Know de money and the lovin is my style
Me a forget it tonight

As the evening winds down, I'm making sure
That my milli got rounds, plane ticket back to town, now
I picked the place, Umberto's of course it's
Italian where they confiscate, burners in they office
Metamorphis anywhere, any year, who dare
They the mob and they don't care, and I swear, while I'm
Contemplatin thinkin about later
Here come the waiter with the phone in the tray, anyways
""Is there a Queen in the house?"" How could he say this out his mouth?
I'm the only black chick with diamonds this thick, hopin'
It's my nigga Blake C
Cause sometimes these cat's like to fool you
Check it, let me school you
Remember when I said those niggas robbed Leo
Rolled on him, stuck him up in the black Geo
They was creole, used to be a tight trio
Til one fled with the dough, what's his name? (Rio!)
I was a girlie lover, smooth undercover
Played they hoes in tight clothes like they was no other
Dumbin like the Jungle Brothers, til they caught me for my gems
All I'm sayin is what he did to me, do it to him, is you straight?
You late, duct tape and cable rope
Once I wrap it round his throat it's all she wrote, uhhhwha (oh oh)

Pull up with my nigga in the eighty foot yacht
Man this hatin' don't stop
Real recognize real you studio gangstas kill me
I know my vets in the game got to feel me
Cause from the gate I *brrrr-raaa* down the door
Like Eddie Murphy I gave it to you raw
Two-piece bikini, Fendi mink draggin' on the floor
Kim been the first lady since I dropped Hard Core
A lot of these hoes livin' vicariously through me
'Steada doin' them, they'd rather do me
Watchin' them is like a Broadway play
Sittin' next to the Queen
Is the closest they'll ever get to Brooklyn
Why ya'll frontin' you know who the best be
I'm the reason why the game so sexy

Show me a man, who neva sin yet, uh-uh
The feds pinched me for shootin'
But instead they indicted me for my fuckin' music
This jealous muthafucker and this prosecutin' dyke bitch
Probly go home, listen to How Many Licks
Stay away from 5-0, that's that hiphop cop
These cheese eatin' rodents really got the game caught
You see when you on top, niggas want what you got
Even though they idolize you, they still critisize you
So don't preach to me bout singing , I, I am just a woman
You've got your feelings I got mine, I'm only human
And I gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I've gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I'm tryna go down as a gyal who know how to get it on
I...gotta go down as a gyal who know how to get it on

I lick dudes in all the right places
G's got cases, tempted to take this
Kitty cat so mean turn dudes into rapists
Niggas flash me they jewels and cash and
Then they ask me to do that nasty
Wanna thrash me then don't walk past me
And when you pass me just holla at me and say

Some like me to do 'em rough and show them
(Some niggas like me to run and stroke them)
Some like objects down they throat and
(I get 'em all strung out and open)
Yes I wrecked 'em down to the rectum
Dick like tetanus shots, I inject 'em
(Pussy is power, listen man)
(My chocha's tighter than a traffic jam) That's tight
(Coochie like drugs, I'm a thousand grams)
(Got fiends from New York to the islands) Damn
Had a bitch that wanted me to cuff her to the bedpole
Seen my dick, and thought it was the bedpole
(One dude went crazy y'all)
(Cause after he hit, he swore that my clit could talk)
Some broads they can barely walk when I'm done with 'em
Call the ambulance man to come get 'em

All Good,The Naked Truth,2005.0,"{ ""It's all good"" ""Gangster"" ""Uh, uhh"" - repeat for 21 seconds* }

Every word I utter, I feel strictly gutter
That's why I touch more green than Tiger's putter
So you mad motherfuckers mutter what you wanna
I ain't worried 'bout none of ya and I'll say it in front of ya
I hear the snakes hiss, talkin reckless
Thought I'd let it go and I wouldn't stress it
Haters in the street, y'all worse than the press is
And they all wanna hang like the charm on my necklace
I guess things just ain't the same for gangsters
How a snitch nigga make a record called ""Wankstas""
Everything these haters do just to degrade ya
Only made me strong, I say thanks for the favor
Now the D.A., wanna give me time in the feds
I'm from Brooklyn, I could do that time on my head
Come down with my weave straight sittin on bread
At the gate, gettin picked up in a new Coupe {?}

""It's all good"" - If you drivin or ridin the bus
""It's all good"" - In the struggle and the times is tough
""It's all good"" - It don't matter you can ride with us
""It's all good"" - It's all good
""It's all good"" - If you hustlin and huggin the block
""It's all good"" - Workin 9 to 5, punchin the clock
""It's all good"" - It don't matter how you get that guap
""It's all good"" - It's all good

See I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, my nigga need bail
It's been a couple weeks and he been sittin' in a cell
The only way to reach him through phone calls and mail
Balloons stuffed with luh up in the chocha
Now my man in the can gettin' money and gettin' high
He used to keep my fly he had the 6 I had the 5
So you know a chick gon' ride or die for her guy
At age 14 I was puttin' on weight
At age 16 I was movin' the weight
Gettin paid for drivin' state to state
Smugglin' weight, prayin I don't bump into Jake
I travelled through a few places with the burners
In the suitcases, thank God for Big
Damn right I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all

""It's all good"" - Niggas run around stuntin and frontin
""It's all good"" - Talkin shit but ain't sayin nuttin
""It's all good"" - It's aight cause they time is comin
""It's all good"" - It's all good
""It's all good"" - They hatin on me but they copy my style
""It's all good"" - Cracked a smile when they saw me on trial
""It's all good"" - You know you can't keep a good bitch down
""It's all good"" - It's all good

Cowards huff and puff but won't blow shit down
I come through like two airplanes in midtown
Nigga my get back's the get down
Hit the big nigga first and make the rest sit down
They all talk loud, when they see you they quiet down
Faggots violated I wish they'd try now
Just watch how they bitch up, story start to switch up
Punks gettin left off right where I pick up
Picture in Vogue, Spring/Summer issue
Shoot game official like a ref with a whistle
You know when I do it I'm doin it monumental
Leave you speechless kinda like an instrumental
They ask me if I know what true happiness
Do I ever feel regret for all the things I did?
Hell no I love the life I live
Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all

Can y'all hear me out there?
(And we want everyone in this motherfucker to get up out their seat)
Ladies and gentlemen, without further adieu
(It's our time)
I'd like to introduce to you, my bitch

Fuck that, bitches don't deserve to rap
I'm back, and I'm about to murder cats
Trying to take my crown, I ain't letting that go down
I cop the four pound and go the whole twelve rounds, yeah
You broke hoes need to throw in the towel
Life's a wheel of fortune and y'all can't buy a vowel
Who me? That's none of your concern
Like ashes in the urn, more money to burn
Damn my ass is firm, stay away from germs
Pussy flawless, get wetter than worms
If you only knew like Aaliyah
How your man be hawking me and stalking me
When he fucking you he see me
Every crack vial or record he sell I get a piecey
Easy, believe me, my words is credible
Ask Nat Cole huh, I'm unforgettable
Don't let the QB get a hold of your guy
Sex him well, get him high, he might fuck around and die

Your so-called vendetta was light like bird feathers
Even with an umbrella, you can't stop my hurricane
I moved on to bigger and better things
Y'all still making minimum wage
First on stage, like the Ever I glazed
Leave you amazed, and keep the fifth by the rib cage
All you jealous ass hoes', rebellious ass hoes'
Still trying to recoup off the first album ass hoes'
You a gangster? Prove it. Wanna shoot me? Do it
That's word to Jerry McGuire, I'll set that ass on fire
Tie you up with barbed wire, carve my name in your face
Pour gasoline on you, drop you at the gas station
Y'all chicks ain't blind, I shine like polyurethane
Cocoa butter cream, vaseline and drugs baby like codeine
Low self-esteem? Uh-uh, the flow is excellent
Yours is satisfactory, return them to the factory
I mean practically, the shit is wack to me
Mama bear, finally out of hibernating
Here to tell you chicks to stop tail-gating

Often tipsy, cabin in Poughkeepsie
I've been in this shit since Biz hit the
One-two, nothing left to do
Move it in there, cathedral ceilings
Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings
P.Diddy introduced me to the business side
Spotted me a few mill and a couple of oil spills
That's how we do it, you chicks is no frills
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
Stealin' tricycles, ridin' bicycles
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
On the countdown (giggles) - don't make me laugh
Got my own company, I'm chief of the staff
They say we twins, then I'm the better half
I'm nasty! Worse than Howard Stern
This court is adjourned, and now it's your turn, bitch!

You talking bout bread? Gotta pay me the loafs

Hundred grand for a show that's a good night

Let's separate the real from the fake
The workers from the bosses, most the nice stones
Turn them diamonds that's flawless

And we don't fuck with 911 that's just the cautious

Good Times,The Notorious K.I.M. (The Lost Tapes),1999,"Uh, where's all my single ladies at?
Where's my single ladies at?
Single ladies clap your hands

They say my music too hard and my mouth too nasty
Clothes too tight and my ass too sassy
I'm a love goddess haven't you heard?
Jehovah's my witness, spread the word
And all scrubs get kicked to the curb
Before you holla at me throw a few dollars at me
I see you got a brick in your pants
Would you like a table dance?
The boss lady make you pay for the sex
Then shake my ass like I'm at a Greekfest
No cash, I take Traveler's Checks
For an extra five g's you can have my address
The things I do I take a real risk
A lot of people think that I'm a real bitch
Don't judge me by the words of this song
Cause the media, they got me figured out wrong

I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about me
I ain't got nothing to hide, my pussy ain't for free
Just like the Benz I drive you out of your mind
Some people think that I'm nasty, I just like having a good time

Yo, yo, yo
Yo that single life shit, that be me
Front ass at the bar, where the chickens be?
Got two hoes, Tonya and Tiffany
Finger in the drawers and we downin' Henessy
Then I hit the door slide to the ride
Now I'm gettin' head in the Q-45
That's LV, minors is six and up
With the big atennas that be sittin' up
I'm livin' it up, drink Cris, piss in the cup
With a bunch of birds that with it to fuck
I love life (no doubt)
So fuck a ho and a wife
Peace and love to all my sluts and my dikes
Cease never treat a bitch nice
I wanna bitch that smoke and don't get an appetite
I fuck to die cause my mom fucked for me
That's why my niggas never sling dick for free
Feel me?

I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea about Cease
I have no love for hoes, my dick just ain't for free
I keep a lot of pussy on my mind
Some people think that I'm nasty
I just like fucking all the time

See some niggas do, and some niggas don't
Pay for the pussy, some niggas won't
See, I ain't the type that can say ""I Don't""
Once the bitch see the six, I ain't gotta do shit

You can be Cash and I'll be Tango
Bingo, you know just how this thang go
Niggas wanna get with me without the ching-ching dough
The Green Bling flow, I don't think so

I jumps out like ""Biotch! Who the fuck you with?""
On some real Jigga shit, haters suck my dick
If you out for the ones then out come the guns
Once I call the duns, then out come the slugs

I got an island name Queen Bee
And a dog that's a Pickingese
What you call romancing, don't tickle my fantasy
Put your money where your mouth is, talk is cheap
Buy me a country and a monkey, or don't even come to me

Ran off on ya nigga twice, he steady calling I ain't calling back

Major key alert
Make sure you secure them bags
He texted my phone and said he got a bag
I picked my best friend up and hit the nigga back
He pulled a ring out, couple chains out
I fucked his brains out, at his mane's house
Then went and gave the jewelry to my young niggas
Cause I just love to fuck
I don't love niggas
He said that he proposed on his last album
Damn, I never heard his last album
Fuck a shooter, I got army troopers
Hella ubers and they full of boosters

Wanna play for a day dad-dy?  In my kitty box

I'm goin to Miami, stylin, whylin

Boys holla when they pass me, call me and harass me
They love me cause I'm nasty, but classy
If you're ballin put your bid in, you broke, forget it
You're just another doll chasin the Kim
I'm in heat like a cat, I'm in heat like a cat
If you want it then you better come and get it


Picture Lil' Kim masturbatin in a drop
Picture Lil' Kim tan and topless on a yacht
Picture Lil' Kim suckin on you like some candy
Picture Lil' Kim in your shirt and no panties
Shirt and no panties... {*moaning*}
Picture Lil' Kim in the pool skinnydippin
Picture Lil' Kim in the 69 position
Picture Lil' Kim dancin on a stripper pole
Picture Lil' Kim in a Playboy centerfold
Playboy centerfold, Playboy centerfold
Playboy centerfold, Playboy centerfold


Lil' Kim's got that potion, my box'll have you open
I'll drown you when I'm wet like the ocean
You crave it, you want it, you want it jump up on it
So you can play in my box 'til the morning

You can play in my box until the morning

Slippin,The Naked Truth,2005.0,"Now don't you know that they want to, catch you
Slippin with no protection
Lead you in the wrong direction
Every nigga around you is a reflection
Of you when you were at your lowest point in your life
Cause niggas wanna catch you slippin
(Don't let 'em catch you slippin)
They wanna catch you slippin (you've been slippin, slippin)

No more Mrs. Nice Bitch
Niggas done, flipped the script and got on some sheist shit
Sellin they soul when love is priceless
They kicked me when I was down and stuck in a crisis
I kept it all in and now I'm 'bout to erupt
Man, FUCK the law the whole system's corrupt
A street grudge put me in front of a judge
But I stood there like what, the Bee don't budge
It's a foul game, no such thing as fair play
And real niggas get railroaded everyday
Words misconstrued and used against you
Then you get screwed when it's time to sentence you
World cavin in, it's a shitty sitch-i-ation
A year and a day, three years probation
Public humiliation, poor representation
Guilty by association

Now don't you know that they want to, catch you
Slippin with no protection
Lead you in the wrong direction
Every nigga around you is a reflection
Of you when you were at your lowest point in your life
Cause niggas wanna catch you slippin
(Don't let 'em catch you slippin)
They wanna catch you slippin (you've been slippin, slippin)

I'mma stand up type, grew up in the projects
And that's worth more than material objects
A lot of things happen when they know you got it
You a target, and now they tryin to get in the pockets
Lawsuits, lawyers prosecute for profit
Meanwhile the media promotin the gossip
I had to say it, cause I'm that real with it
You shinin like a star, then you gotta deal with it
And dudes pick to take these groupies to bed
Better watch it 'fore they write a book about like Superhead
Fuck 'em and leave 'em then they after your paper
Put a hole in the condom and say that you raped her
See you can be a rapper, athlete or an actor
Believe me, these devils find a way to get at'cha
All it takes is some green and your face on the screen
Fuck it, just say I took one for the team

Now don't you know that they want to, catch you
Slippin with no protection
Lead you in the wrong direction
Every nigga around you is a reflection
Of you when you were at your lowest point in your life
Cause niggas wanna catch you slippin
(Don't let 'em catch you slippin)
They wanna catch you slippin (you've been slippin, slippin)

In these streets you gotta sleep with one eye open
And watch for the snakes and the Jakes approachin
Cause it could be the ones that you laugh and joke wit
The ones you smoke wit, and sold your coke wit
I set you up for the right piece of change
And have your brains on the dashboard of the Range
Too often, I seen a nigga layin in the coffin
All cause some shit was blown out of proportion
Everywhere you go you gotta move with caution
Cause the rap game ain't much different than the crack game
It's the new hustle, gotta have brains and muscle
Get too much money and these haters wanna touch you
Now I can see why they all on me
Niggas do dirty work, the shit fall on me
Not only do you gotta watch the boys in blue
But the niggas in your crew you gotta watch them too

Now don't you know that they want to, catch you
Slippin with no protection
Lead you in the wrong direction
Every nigga around you is a reflection
Of you when you were at your lowest point in your life
Cause niggas wanna catch you slippin

I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Keep still in the shit, killin the rhyme
The Queen stay poppin the wine and cockin the nine
For those who think they stoppin my dough
Wanna copy my show, wha
I'm switchin my flow, can't take it no mo'
Oh you think I'm playin around
I'm layin ya down
Album drop, new millenium shuttin it down
Better off givin it up, I'm rippin it up
Spendin money, livin it up, not givin a fuck
Hiding the tote, runnin the coast
Makin niggas catch the Holy Ghost
I'm realer than most, wha

You know the routine
Smoke you like a ciggarette-r
We've been, out in a bit
Y'all still talkin shit
Ain't that a bitch?
What part of the game was this?
Millions I'm holdin'
Drop tops rollin'
Diamonds on my neck
And Bentley ballin'
Me and my niggas gettin' high all day
Straight to the top, cuz we on our way
Comin' for y'all, comin' for y'all
That's right I got something for y'all

Back when it used to be the eighties
Said the world was gon' end in 2000 (that's crazy)
I'm the only thing to fear
For the new year
New year, and if BIG was here (woo)
Get the fans, we the ones to talk
We die real on the streets
So watch where you walk
And you can find me, usually
Talkin' dirty to a cat thugged out
Or even kinda nerdy

Taking over like a plague on a town
All y'all can do is pray and watch it go down

Something for y'all, wha
God bless me, look at all I've been through
It's my time, I can feel it, can't you?

Well, if you told me, you were drowning
I would not a lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
Saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

You should never compare diamonds to a rhinestone
I'm like Khaleesi on the Game of Thrones
Get under your skin and burn your flesh and bones

Though you always hate, all you do is make me great

All of a sudden, everybody wan' bang with us
Don't they know them Gotti kids are dangerous?
Come come now, y'all need to stop
Niggas better hold they head 'fore they body rock
I got, soldiers in every town
That'll come see y'all like ""Black Hawk Down""
I ain't playin with you motherfuckers
(RAAAAAAID!) I'm sprayin you motherfuckers
If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money?  I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect
Niggas be like, ""Here come the IRS!""
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than ""Jaws""
With or without my boys, I still make noise

New York - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all turn it up
Midwest - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all burn it up
L.A. - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
Y'all make them cars jump
Dirty South - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all get it crunk!

My last album, some of y'all wasn't ready for it
Alright, I slow it up, put the brakes on for ya
I know what I'm doin, I ain't losin my mind
I'm just so advanced I'm ahead of my time
You all stuck at the back, I'm ahead of the line
Even in the dark, I'm still gon' shine
You'll see what I mean in 2009
I kick outer space raps - ILL RHYMES
Live guitars, nigga fuck cars
I'm tryin to buy a spaceship to get to Mars
Look out the window, and reach for the stars
It's a new day, Lil' Kim's in charge
Got a big dick, I'll bone you out
Like money in the bank, loan you out
If you ain't straight I'll comb you out
Lil' Kim and Scott Storch be zonin out!


Ain't wanna do it, but now I got to pop my collar
You actin like y'all real tough act to follow
I got medallions the size of a half a dollar
And about to buy my best friend a beauty parlor
I know y'all don't wanna see Kim on top
Please stop worryin about what I got
What the fuck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters
I might start my day at Piaget'
Or with a Mafia meetin at the Brooklyn Cafe
""Okay, y'all wanna play?""
Like 9/11, you gon' remember this day

Here come a bitch with the fly puss', and a nigga with the fly dick
In the Mickey and Mallory mode, rollin through the streets on 24's, on krunk screamin, ""Die bitch!""
Bout to shut yo' shit down, anybody that opposes to payin us a fee false
If the straps don't bleed y'all, we put stitches in yo' motherfuckin dome like a league brawl
(Come and roll with this) Take a journey to the realm of the truth when I bust this, it's the Duke and the Duchess
Leavin haters 'buked and on crutches, niggas you cannot touch this
It's a new collaboration of Thug Luv, between the Thug Queen and the Thug Lord
More power than a drug lord, meant to be because we love each other the way we love war
Gotta rider bet hug yours, cause I'm full of ambition and ammunition and a 50 like I smoked a sticky stack of hash
Ain't no missin on no critical condition, murderin is the mission and we can bust a itchy atcha ass
Feel the flow when I drop it, don't when to stop it, I'm goin pockets and layin bodies down
Feel adrenaline from me and Kim and them, we got it sewed from Brooklyn to Chi-Town
See the artillery, we don't fuck around with silly games, plenty thangs
Nigga plus I got an illy aim, stick 'em up, steal his chain, then I spill his brain, then I feel his pain
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Queen, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us

It's the T-W-I-S to the T-A, K to the motherfuckin I-M
Bout to shut yo' shit down, other albums come out ain't NOBODY gon' buy them
Now who gon' deny them? I'm scared of myself, don't nobody wanna try Kim
Y'all know you done fucked up (now whassup - y'all better come roll with us)
Who's you Mister? It's Lil' Kim and Twista (and we about this)
For those who doubt this, the game is ours (we gon' run you up out this)
What a wonderful feeling when you're stealin a million, but the billion jackpot's what I aim for
Get your hands in the air, put 'em up, keep 'em high, don't want no problems - JUST GIMME WHAT I CAME FOR!
Pull up on your block, eight straight Hummers, bout to have it locked, eight straight summers
Bank account hold eight straight numbers, ain't no room for you whack newcomers
We the people's choice because we kick that, Nasty ""Hardcore"" shit that you wanna hear
Can't fuck with us, hands down we win best murder rap of the year
Pounds to the misters, hugs for the miss, bombs in the mail, sealed with a kiss
All my bitches pop that thing like this, all my niggas wave that bling on the wrist
Some of the consequences when you dealin with a plug thug
And I'm backed up by the Duke, we gon' take over the world, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

You can't fuck with us; do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us
All my true thugs and all my real bitches, won'tcha come and ride with us
Do it like a hustler, gotta keep it gangsta, can't no one collide with us

 Kim is yo' flow hot?  Like a gun shot  Twist' is yo' flow cold?  Well I think so
 Kim do you got dranks  Crist' by the box  Twist' do you got smokes  Well I got 'dro, now baby we can roll

Do it like a gangsta, creepin like a murderer, strapped while I roll on chrome
Lookin for the ones we at war with, when we see 'em we gon' aim for your dome

Hear me Ma we can run this Earth together, come up worse than ever
Havin big dreams while we back up this work together
Let's set up shop on the block now, takin over yo' tip, even if we gotta slang dubs
Go to war because I love blood, with a Queen by my side, whatchu know about Thug Luv?

Do it like a hustler, Lil' Kim and Twista, might as well ride with us
Male groupies, girl groupies, they're all gon' side with us
Whatcha gon' do, it's the Duke and the Duchess, you need to give it up

I Know You See Me,The Naked Truth,2005.0,"""What you see, is what you get""

Ay - I know you see me on the screen now - riiight
I know you see me do my thing now - true
Tryin hard not to stare, actin like I wasn't there to you
Can you see me now?  Am I clear to you?
On the red carpet in Marc Jacobs clothes
You see me fashion week, front row at all the shows
In your favorite fashion magazine they feature the Queen
On the cover of Don Divas, doin spreads with Eva
When we walk down the street, dudes call us the covergirls
We stand out when we next to them other girls
I don't bend easy, budge or break
Trust me, ju don't want it with the female Scarface
Your girl come through twirlin in droptop 'Rossa
Me and my la familia like a ""Goodfellas"" poster
You see I'm somethin you never seen befo'
I know you see me cause I'm somethin that you can't igno'(ignore), ohh

Dipped fresh, hoppin out of a Rolls
In the town, ballin out of control
V-V-S's set in platinum and gold
Standin room only, all of my shows
Apple bottom bustin out of my jeans
On the screen with the man of your dreams
Front page of your new magazines
Ay show some love, pay respect, I'm the Queen bitch

And you should see me in the summertime, stretched out in one of my
Droptops all you hip-hop bitches borderline
I'm livin off of your man, he supportin mine
You'd kill me if I give you the chance, bitch I was born to shine
While you on your grind I'm on, beachfront property
Thirty-eight snub nose, keep the snitches off of me
Look the rest of your life, ain't gon' find a bitch as raw as me
Grateful's what you oughta be, I heard somewhere it cost to be
The boss and I paid it, floss with the greatest
Ball outrageous the broad is amazin
In the 6, grippin woodgrain lane changin
You coach flyin hoes need boss bitch trainin
I'm muy caliente, sizzlin hot flame
In private planes to Spain and you barely maintainin
You ain't talkin millions you ain't speakin my language
The Queen of the game and can't a damn thing change it

Dipped fresh, hoppin out of a Rolls
In the town, ballin out of control
V-V-S's set in platinum and gold
Standin room only, all of my shows
Apple bottom bustin out of my jeans
On the screen with the man of your dreams
Front page of your new magazines
Ay show some love, pay respect, I'm the Queen bitch

What you see is, is what you get
Lil' Kim Queen Bee is real, as real can get
I'm a certified hustler, so cut that check
Raised in the streets of Brooklyn, what you expect?

Dipped fresh, hoppin out of a Rolls
In the town, ballin out of control
V-V-S's set in platinum and gold
Standin room only, all of my shows
Apple bottom bustin out of my jeans
On the screen with the man of your dreams
Front page of your new magazines
Ay show some love, pay respect, I'm the Queen bitch",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-i-know-you-see-me-lyrics

Chillin’ Tonight,Ms. G.O.A.T.,2008.0,"Yeaaah!
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Yeaaah!
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight

My girls goin' out tonight (yeaaah!)
But I'ma fall back tonight
Me and my man takin' it in tonight
Yeah, we gon' get it in tonight
We gon' smoke something, drink something, toast something
So he can beat the pussy up like it stole something
Get it poppin' all night 'til like 4 somethin'
And then we right back at it 'round 6 somethin'
It's supposed to be girls night out
So you know he got my girlfriends cursin' me out
Sayin' that I'm whipped and he turnin' me out
No need for the gym 'cause he be workin' me out
For me, he got a huge appetite
Lick my ice cream like a tasty delight
The bond between us is tight
I heard Duve poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight

Tonight it's just me and my boo
Candlelight dinner, sippin' some wine too
Lingerie see-through, you know how I do
Playin' slow jams to set the mood
Some Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, a little Anita
In the bed laughin' at Martin and Gina
All eyes on us like we Brad and Angelina
No one can come between us
The things he do give me the chills
Like writin' out ""I Love You"" in hundred dollar bills
He don't even think about playin' the field
He in ecstasy without takin' a pill
He treats me like a queen I love the way he courts me
Makin' love in the Ferrari he just bought me
Playin' play station, fight night
I heard Stereo poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
Victoria Secret lingerie on
Layin' up with my nigga tonight
We 'bout to get it on, turn off the phone
It's all about my man tonight

From the bed, to the kitchen, to the living room couch
We done blessed every room in this New York penthouse
Miami estate, house by the lake
We ain't watchin' pornos, we watchin' our own sex tape
I pour the Henny all over his jimmy
So when he stick it in me, he's drunk off of Kimmy
I make a nigga bust faster than a semi
'Cause Kimmy get the jimmy rock harder than a penny
Full body massage, champagne bubble bath
Then we make love on a bed made of cash
He can't get enough, he always ready to smash
He love how I'm shaped just like a hourglass
His niggas is tight, he chillin' with his wife
But they don't come before the love of his life
We in the crib havin' a pillow fight
I heard Lotus is poppin' tonight but

I ain't goin' to the club or hangin' with my girls
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight
R. Kelly got a show, but I can't go
I'm chillin' with my nigga tonight

I treat it so special, now you hoes jealous
Fake hoes, got several, they tens or better

Ever since I came out the chain game

Killing these hoes, it's a genocide
Pussy drown a nigga, like riptides

Pull up in that two-thousand twenty Benz
Cause I be on that new shit, bananas in my asshole
My man be on that zoo shit, wanna fuck me til' my eyes roll

It's my time to shine (peace to all originals)
Ohhhhh (peace to all the gods)
Yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. the clique! whooooo

Blessed by the God, so I be the Earths
Queen B Bitch, Poppa keep me rich
Ain't gun tottin', keep floatin in them automobiles
Pack with steel, engines filled with Benjamins
I got half a mill stashed in the 
For womanizers and a hand full of hoes that hate
But lately, it seems people make the world go round
From A to Z, I break 'em down alphabetically
Pethtically, I puts the pressure
In ya Jones bet you fall like a Motorol Burn Out
Flip ya jacks and ya snitch ass back, to the cell of your block
HDM lock, and I wish you would stop
All that bawlin', cryin'
Lyin', 'cause this black Queen is shinin'
You didn't know I was Lieutenant, bitch, well that's primary
You just a secondary secretary
Envy against me
Because I stay laced in Ellen Tracey, Dolce & Gabanna
And people love me for my style, my personal
Niggas go wild and want to have my child
Bet I just sit back and enjoy
The optimism given from a girl to a boy (that's what it's all about)
It's all about the ones the guns just another day that earth lose a son

It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine

We all know what it means to be broke, breaking niggas off
For some X and some Smoke , some like to mix it with rocks
Trees I like 'em fine, straight up marijuin'
And I put the lent in ya dents
Then you'll be stressed out with no dollars and no cents
Dressed in gear from last year, that you bought
Before you quit your job at the airport
Thinkin' you gon' make a mill from this rap game
But you labeled as a lame and it's a damn shame
No fame, no name, show no shame
Who's to blame? (Tell me  you want it)
Now you wanna lick a shot 'cause you ain't got
Get props, runnin' up in niggas' spots
Just a little gets to make cash
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash
Quick fast, get mad, 'cause ya man's in my whip
Honey, button ya lip 'cause my clit is too thick
It's all about the guns, the ones
Just another day that the Earth lose a son

It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine

And y'all ain't stop me from burn y'all just don't learn

(What's the word?) She at it again
(What's the word?) She in it to win
(What's the word?) She back and she's stayin
(What's the word?) The bitch ain't playin

And just when y'all thought y'all had the victory
The one point game I fucked around and hit a three
Swish!!!!! All fuckin net
It's the fourth quarter your pourin down sweat
Rap's M.V.P. don't you ever forget
Since you came in this game are there any regrets?
And y'all, dukes are lame don't let 'em back in
What? You ain't heard? Keep at it again
Yo it's cold at the camp, but I'm in it till it's over
Notorious soldier thought I told ya
Niggas is pissin me off right now
But like that dance, I'm a shake 'em off right now
Who's hot and who's not what's rap and what's not
Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block
The neighborhood better keep they fuckin door locked
Beanie told y'all but I got proof
I speak the truth, everytime I step in the booth
Uh! Pretty things is all that I mean
Better listen to the words that she sings

(What's the word?) She in it to win
(What's the word?) She back and she's stayin

And now I could see why y'all all on me
You need a hot remix you could call on me
Niggas do dirty work the shit fall on me
But I could hold that weight and still bake that cake
We get it on in Brooklyn no lie Bed-Stuy holla back B.I. till I die!!!
We get it on in Brooklyn no lie Bed-Stuy holla back B.I. till I die!!!
Get money always but I ain't givin up rap

Buy me out, you need more cheddar than that

Whatever nigga I take your spot and your spot
Move work from your block to your block

Last Day,The Naked Truth,2005.0,"When it's my last day, then it's my last day
But until that day, you can't take away
How they scream my name, how I pimp this game
Critically acclaimed, until my last day

Y'all better stand up or sit down, cause I'mma be here
Pull up a beach chair and pop you a Becks beer
I'mma live it up, 'til I'm a hundred with gray hair
Glass house in Bel-Air that's, high up in the mountain
Golden gates, and the brass water fountain
'Til my last day, I'm goin hard
And I ain't slowin up, 'til the Heliport's in my back yard
'Til my whole team sign they name on that black card
'Til I bring New York back, 'til I show you where I'm from
'Til I show you how it's done, show you why I'm number one
'Til my peeps is out the hood, 'til I buy my moms a jet
'Til I own my first island and cash a trillion dollar check
'Til I'm at the top of Forbes' richest lookin kosher
With my name and my picture, right next to Oprah
In negotiations with Bill Gates and his broker
'Til I'm with Jehovah it ain't over 'til it's over


Besides God, what the fuck should I fear?
The only one could stop me is that chick in the mirror
I built my career on, blood sweat and tears
And I'm still here, gettin stronger each year
Cause what don't kill me, could only help build me
I guess all that dirt just made me more filthy
If being loyal's a crime, then I'm so guilty
If you was missin a spine you'd still have to feel me
Some came and went but your girl is everlasting
'Til the day I'm gasping (gasping)
And niggas droppin tears on my Versace casket
And I'm, reunited with Big, like nigga what happened?
Shit got drastic, I missed you with a passion
By now they should realize I'm not the average rap chick
Ain't nuttin they could do now to stop my shine
This is God's plan homey, it ain't mine


Until my heartbeat stops, my flesh goes numb
And the last breath leaves my lung, I'll be
The big Q.B., the problem in Prada
The bitch that these rap hoes wanna become
I been hated on many times, adored and idolized
Check your stats, I'm all that, bottom line
It's all there in black and white, read it and weep
I'm the, perfect example of keepin it street
Cause when it's all said and done and at the end of the day
My actions spoke louder than whatever they say
Yeah I'll rep the hood, stood the test of time
So a cell'll hold my body and never my mind
So, never mind any of y'all petty tactics
I'm gettin fetty, movin through them tax brackets
Bitch you gotta be kiddin me, Kim's the epitome
I'm the ghost of Big so you could never get rid of me",https://genius.com/Lil-kim-last-day-lyrics

Toss 'em in the lake like Ricky bitch
And I stay on this money, like a pyramid
Yeah, I've been about a cheque, hoe
You stole your whole swag, you worse than a klepto'
I just blow 'em kisses, X 'n' O
Got 'em sick to their stomach, P-p-pepto
All you bitches is some bums
I feel your cup up with change
You hoes should be rappin' on the number four train
The price of your mother's house, I paid for my Range
Uh, and that's a autobiography
I swear these hoes be obsessed how they copy me
Laxative flow, I'm shittin' on 'em constanly
And I leave a stain like I ain't wiped my ass properly

You ain't got enough funds for me
This designer pussy make a nigga run through his money (woo!)
Dressed in all Coco, but my purse Versace
Diamonds on my fingers, touching keys like I'm Liberace
Cannons on me, but this ain't a camera on me
I ain't with the bullshit, all my niggas shooting like they Gotti Gotti
Cruise the desert in Bugattis out in Abu Dhabi
Head shots all net, I be playing hockey
White house, white coupe, but ain't a fucking Nazi
I got the Nagasaki, he gon' sip on me like sake

We with the shits outside like a Port-a-Potty
We ride in the coupe the roof vacant on Collins

But you all in my comments, while I'm changing the climate
Ain't no change in this wallet, ain't no flaws in these diamonds

Yo, check 'em out, yo you you
When it's murder on my mind, I do it all the time
Got tombstone flow, with a casket rhyme
Your gats is plastic, I got platinum nines
With gold shells Banger Vegas tap ya spine
I'm the type to spaz out and take back what's mine
Rep for my hood niggas slingin' crack and dimes
Half is mine, so you know it's half my time
In the pen or the box, with my man on the ox
We gon do it like we did it on the block
Let's roll, like with 60's 30's
40 niggas with me
Rep ya hood, rep ya block, rep ya city
This is me talkin', without the Remy in me
I kick it from the heart, that's why niggas feel me
Show y'all the true meanin' why Banger act willie

Iceburg sweaters wit Kim name on it
Cease-A-Le Tee wit big blood stain on it
Every time I sign a check, I sign a thug name on it
Niggas got rhymes but they flow's so borin'
No stage shows, so forget about tourin'
Mad at my team 'cause my niggas stay scorin'
All you gotta do is make a false move and it's warnin'
My guns bust

Rain down long like Kim gettin' dressed in the mornin'

Cause we in the parkin lot, you know the toys is there
Pushin drop Bee wagons, two doors, ya hear?
Hold it now, the Queen's sittin in the chair

I'm bout to pull the plug on all y'all broads this year

I like to play with my coochie when I'm up in the tub
You a, sensitive thug, lemme give you a hug
Y'all thirsty-ass niggas take this bottle of bub

Because of me y'all rock rhymes in high heel shoes

I might give a, little head to {""hold it, hold it now""}
All we ask is y'all show respect
Cause we don't want talk, big homey, just cut the check!

Bad boy
Queen Bee
C'mon, c'mon
Verse One: Kim
If I could make it rain
I'd make it rain diamonds
So all the girls in the world
Could keep shrinining
From princess cuts to emeralds to H-classes
Yeah, I failed math, but bet I passed the E-class
Went from Chanel number 5 to two point five
The Melrose resident
, every rooms a president
With the live in waiters, betcha haters can't match that
You're six digits short to catch that
Your're net year gross it 20 thow on commission
My net week gross 100 mil in addition to to the Dow Jones
Stocks, restaurants out in Rome
Plus all the over head
And the interest on those loans
Chorus:
I want diamonds
(She said she wants a man- to buy her a Lexuz Land)
But that's all right for her
But still it ain't enough for me
I want diamonds
She said she wants a guy
To do it to her every night
That's all right for her
But you gotta go down on me
Verse Two: Kim
I had bitches rockin the red, yellow and green wigs
Cats in they raps tryin to act like Big
Remember when Big told y'all
Get Money
Remember when Big said play them niggas like dummies
Check it
If I could separate all the game from the glory
I'd rather be with Frank, but that's a different story
Cause now a days niggas ain't sayin shit (word)
Runnin off at the lips about what they gonna get
And what they had in '86
I puts them on the spot
Pull out the lab top
With the receipt for the yacht
What you got?
Niggas be mute all of a sudden
What, I pushed a button?
Shit, that ain't nothin'
Bridge:
I don't care if he's young or old
Just make him very rich
I just want someone that can spend dough
I want diamonds
Yes I do
And a house that's made of gold
There's only one thing better than money
Come into my bedroom honey
Verse Three: Kim
So we can have a drink or two
Cosmos, if you ghetto this Buds for you
Here's a few
So he can be nice
When I show him this ice
On my chest
That I bought with his American Express
I'm a mess, never-the-less
I'm authentic
Ninety-nine percent B-K
One percent N-J
Excuse me
Cause what I'm tryin to say
Is if you ain't thorogh
Stay out my borough
Cause when my gun burn, it's loud like Pairos
And when it's your turn, you fold like Gyros
And ya'll buy your suits in portions
I get mine's from an auction
Million dollar dress that belongs to the princess
While ya'll shopping at Saks
I been there, done that
Copt the sweater and the hat

While most of y'all broads is just drag queens
It's gonna take years before you match our cream (That's right)
And only in your dreams can you see what we see

Now lend me your ear, listen closely
I wear these jewels like a rosary
This is how the rap game is supposed to be
One king, one queen things supposed to be

Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on
Now get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on, now do it

Trade in that Range, get a motherfuckin' plane
Your girl is lame, huh what?
Want a bitch like me what, huh?
If it's diamonds you want, baby, I got 'em
Money in a briefcase, who needs a wallet?
Be a pigeon, nigga, you sound retarded
I'm the girl with more green than St. Patrick's Day
A house by the bay so what do you say?
Me and you, nigga like running Roulette
The game is strip poker, is you ready to play?
Make it last all night and I'm ready to stay
Put your money and your jewels up one at time
And if you lose this game all this shit is mine
What you got? Full house, triple ace and two kings
Royal flush beats ten jack, here give me
I win give it up

Now get your back up off the wall
Dance come on
Now get your back up off the wall

When it comes to sex call me Dr. Ruth
I ain't a prostitute I just speak the truth
Dicks I like 'em fat like a pickle
Hard like nickel, juicy like a Popsicle
Niggas mention me for a sexual reference
Lil Kim's everybody's sexual preference
A bitch like me gives it on the first date
Why hesitate? I ain't got time to wait!
Cause uh y'all know how I get down
(How you get down?)
Niggas from the East know how I get down
(That's right!)
Cats from the West know how I get down
(West Side!)
From the North to South say can you get down!

A queen is not a queen because she is felt
But a queen is a queen because failure has not stopped her
Take it from me, the queen of all queens
Women are taking over for the new millennium, haw!
What the hell do you want from me?
I'm just tryna be all that I can be
I'm a god damn legacy
Thanks to B.I.G. and Puff Daddy
The first lady runs the world now
They impeached the president from his residence
No one drops bombs 'til I say so
One, two, one, two, three, go!

I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals
I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals

How dare you accuse me and my family
Fucking clones, leave us alone!
Me and Puff is like Janet and Mike
You make us wanna (scream), know what I mean?
(Yeah, yeah) I know y'all rather see us dead
No more platinum plaques certified lead
We got too many chips for y'all
Queen Bee, Queen Bee make hits for y'all
Take a deep breath
Inhale, exhale 'til there's no more left
In the name of the father, son, and daughter
Here comes the new world order!
You can't stop it
Mother Earth this my universe
When worse comes to worse (uh huh)
I call the shots (uh huh), stack all the lots (uh huh)
Pack all the Glocks, take the safety off lock, fire!

I'm human, you're human

I'm human, you're human
So they said but inside we're all animals

Can I jingle it, baby? Go 'head, baby
Can I jingle it, baby? Go 'head, baby (hmm)
Take it out, let me sit on it
You can't make it wet, just spit on it
Ah don't stop 'til it rise to the top
Promise you won't drop 'til the cherry go (pop)
And if it doesn't fit then use your lips
Oh, here it comes, what's my name? Queen Bitch!

Yo.. I just don't understand
Lately, it seems like.. I don't know
It just seems like.. it seems like
Everybody wants

My style, my life, my blood
My shoes, my clothes, my gear
My watch, my rings, my chain
My cars, my money, my home
My body, my sweat, my tears
My power, my fame, my strength
My shit, my this, my that
Bitches, please!

If you don't stop;
Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (this is a warning)
Someone's puttin tags on your toes (this is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (this is a warning)
And put the {*chk-chk*} straight in your, mouuuuuth
... This is a woman's, THREAT (this is a woman's)

Have you ever heard the story, about the M.A.F.I.A. tip
See Big Poppa was shot, a long long long long time ago
And when he was killed, he left me with the throne
And now it seems like, everyone wants my blood

Don't stop, no no
You'll be sorry
Keep doin it, you'll see
You'll be cryin

It's Queen Bee, Sex in the City
Representing up top, brought the block wit' me
Custom Versace dress, showing one titty
In Brooklyn, New York, grimey and gritty
Men see the vide-oh, and go lick the TV slow
I show 'em things, they never seen before
Cause the way I move, is so flexible
I'll try anything, Imma try sexual
The blindfolds and handcuffs, a bit rough
When my thighs wrap around his head, like earmuffs
Doin' freaky weird stuff, talk tough, face down
And step into the Queen with the diamond laced crown
The Jewel of the Nile, I'm romancing the stone
I said ""look bitch I got your man on the phone""
But you can swing through, if you want a peep show
Just bring a hun'ed grand and some Veuve Clicquot

I'm a superfreak, I'm superfreaky-aah
You know I want it, so give it to me-aah
I'm Miss Prada and Chanel, Gucci as hell
Voulez-vous-coucher with this mademoiselle
I sell sex high price, the rap Heidi Fleiss
In Iceberg jeans, that ass looks mighty nice
And this is the fabulous life of Kim Jones
I got chinchilla covers on my flip phones
To match with them furs, baby got back with them curves
A female matte, with makeup on my words
Flow, mascara and blush
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us
Comparison, what? Ain't nobody close to me
I'm on top, right where I'm supposed to be
And now, haters all kiss my bikini wax
And if you've seen the facts, you know the Queen is back!

It's my birthday, so go and get the cake
You can have it, you can eat it, just lick the plate
Cause the taste is great, and my panties are edible
Incredible, Natalie Cole, Unforgettable
How are you? Big squirt, little muscle
Keep grindin' I got a non-stop hustle
And don't quit, you can't push without pull
And you know you can't talk, when you got your mouth full
Now put your face in it, and just nod your head
Go on work it on down, too my thighs and legs
Put your face in it, no bitch can see me
Got the whole block buzzin', number one Queen Bee
Put your face in it, men gather round
Laid back, hypnotized, I'm the talk of the town
Put your face in it, get right or get gone
It gets no realer, fake bitches go home

This is Who I Am,La Bella Mafia,2003.0,"Swizz Beatz (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
I introduce to you (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
The Queen Bee (Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?)
She hold the crown in this game (Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?)
Ladies and Gentleman...

It's the worlds famous, Lil' Kim, Queen Bee
I am who I am, you just can't change me
No matter what you do, you can't take the hood out me
People been around me for years, don't know shit about me
Dedicated, like Muslims makin' selat
People steady try to make me into somethin' I'm not
That's why I had to cut the grass, so I could see the snakes
Copped the house on the hill so I could see the lakes
What you thought? I'm a girl, couldn't make it alone
Time to turn the heat up and get back in the zone
One day my hairs orange, the next day it's green
The trendsetter's back on your TV screen

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

About five feet even, kinda small in the waist
Rap's sex symbol, real pretty in the face
So what I got even bigger titties than the lakes
Still a sophisticated lady with millions in the safe
Switch up flows like I switch up my clothes
More than Wilt Chamberlain switched up his hoes
I'm a profectionist, gotta stay on my toes
Anything goes when you play with the pro's
I got everybody rappin' about jewelry and cars
Lil' Kim give you a platinum sixteen bars
I'm the real thing, ya'll kareokee stars
This is who I am

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

I'd rather be dead and rich than broke and livin'
Without rap, I probably woulda been sellin' dope in prison
With some Vera Wang khakis and Nolteychucks
Suckin' the warden's dick in the back of the bus
But God made me what I am today
So I say things ya'll afraid to say
Just cause you got a head start that don't make you strongest
He who burns last, burns the longest
Fuck what they say about me
Fact is I'm the legacy of B.I.G
The Queen of New York, let's get this straight
I'm about to be elected mayor of 718

This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
This is who I am (This is who I am)
This is what I be (This is what I be)
People runnin' 'round (People runnin' 'round)
Tryna change me (Tryna change me)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)
Oh, no, no, no, no (Oh, no, no, no, no)
No, no, no (No, no, no)

If you in the club
You are listening to the sounds
Of the *scratch* Queen Bee baby
Ride the bar, Queen Bee baby
Mashonda on the hook
I go by the name of... the Monster

Who Shot Ya?,The Unreleased Tracks,2013,"Who shot ya? I'm the Notorious K.I.M
Queen Bitch, cause the streets say I am
Play private airports, fashion week I'm on the runway
Feds tryna tie me to all sorts of gunplay
Must be the mon-ey
Paparazzi looking for my limo I breeze out in the Hyundai
Biggie warned me the more money more problems
Now that I'm on the new levels, I see the new devils
My flame stay on high, so I walks right through em
Old school, new school, I really don't care
I burn baby burn like smokey the bear
Y'all don't want nothing here, it's election season
And your number one candidate is leading
The lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with Queen Bee it ain't safe
Leave the stinger in your face, like you got the mumps
Kim spit that shit to give you niggas goosebumps
Honey girl break rules, make moves
Bitches mad cause I keep multi-millionaire dudes all around me
A billion cock rhymes, any of you bitches
Whisperin about mines, and I'm and I'm
Bedstuy's finest, you rewind this
Brooklyn's behind this
GO BROOKLYN!



I seen the light, got rid of all the creeps
Camera's in the crib, bullet proofed out the jeeps
Y'all go ahead and sleep, got to watch my back
Think the coke and law enforcement acts make me slack?
A bitch is all that, cock sucker, ease up
This laser beam device make a nigga freeze up
'st cut the check, respect I demand it
Slip and break the seventh commandment
Thou shall not fuck with the Queen, or see Poppa
Send you straight to BIG in the chopper
I feel for you, pop my collar like the Fonz
Royalty watch, while Lil' Kim on the arm
Put your money where your mouth is, contracts in the briefcase
You name the time and the place
Make sure you remember my face snake bitches
Fake bitches, what the fuck y'all wanna do bitches?
More better, got the haystack
I'm in the phantom, she's in the Maybach

Take trips to Paris not the Hiltons
I'm talking about France, true romance
Walk the red carpet together and hold hands
Style on the haters, wave at the fans
Cause right now our love don't live here
First to reconcile, something gotta give here
Few niggas out there trying to live here
Put a ring on it, drop a few kids here

Hey, Lil' Kim, this is RuPaul and I have one thing to say to you
You better work!

Gave the keys to valet told him park it
Then I jumps out the Zora, Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R L-S is in the stretch LS
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bulgari perfume from a mile you smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill'
Depending how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites, never get into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes

9 times out of 10 we ain't sober
We takin' over like Frances
Switchin' our styles like the hottest new dances
And we don't give a fuck so we take chances
To get large like breast enhancements
Bitches be hatin', sayin' we freaks

I ignore them whores, accept my applause
Then I say ""cheese"" for the paparrazi

I'm on some freak shit tonight, think I ain't
I hope you don't mind a little ketchup on your frank
Either you with it, or either you ain't
You know how it is when Aunt Dot cock block
I beat my niggas with a whip
I breast feed niggas with my tit
And if I catch my man with a chick
I get on some Lorena Bobbitt shit, what

Yours is like Evander, seventy-seven slow

Pop the tops out, they clear the spot out

Handle repercussions

Niggas stand in line, pay a fee for me to kiss 'em
Twenty-one's the lucky number, once the ""E"" is in the system
One night with the Q.B., and niggas need maturity
Keep my pussy tight like the President's security

But I don't love you dudes
Tape you eatin' my pussy and throw you on the interlude (scene)
You think I give a fuck cause you paid for my food?
Put you out on the highway and make you strip nude, (hehe)
Then drive away in your car with your wallet
Thought I was sweet meat
Look what you done started 
You ain't know about the,""set it off queen bitch""
In the Porsche, license plate read,""filthy rich""
I spend money
Lend money
I play niggas with money
Matter fact I love money
And I never borrow

Me sees P.Diddy and the fam
In the back by the rest rooms, shaking hands with the fans
Funny style cats bump us while we dance
You know a broke nigga always fucks up the plans
DJ switch the music to the Wu-tang clan
D-Rock hit himm in the face with the Saint Ives can
Security came through, broke it up, then he ran
Be back at the bar again
Laughin' and partyin'
Jerks showin off pullin 50s out they clothes (for real)
Please babe, bro we blow our nose with those ((you kno) dun kno)
Linen crushed out
Egyptian mushed out
Some boy lookin' shot in the party rushed out
My niggas, they surround me like the pope
You should've seen the shit, one big joke
And as usual, this cat with an afro
Snitchin' for no dough

Fuckin' dodo

It's Lil' Kim, the one they all love and hate
The Queen's back bitches, regurgitate
I got these hoes real sick like a stomach ache
Blue-faced Rollies, animals on my vertebrae
We out the country, nah we don't do States
Married to the game, nah we don't do dates
I'm eatin' good, but I gotta watch my weight
Fourteen carats in my salad gold plate (Ha-ha-ha)
I treat the track like a bedpan
I got ill thoughts, need a head scan
Got that old money, like the Bread Man
That's why these bitches all rotten like a dead man
From London to Italy, Romania to France
I'm diplomat status, check the passport stamps
You hoes is pathetic, faker than prosthetics
Somebody call the paramedics

Let it off then we fleeing the scene
They ain't see us but they heard that it was me and the Queen
I got this Tom Ford shit on, and she in McQueen
Think I'm going colorblind, all I see is the green
Ain't worth counting if it ain't done properly
House on the mountain, V12's on the property
Cup full of drink, big Dutch full of broccoli
Cancer on the track, even Dre can't doctor me
No penicillin, no antibiotic
Just the Purple Haze, lil' something exotic
Booth or the barrel, quicker to the cabbage
Al-Qaeda Jada, sicker than your average

To everybody in the crowd got they own bottle
Nails done, hair done, manicured toes
They still on them pink bottles, we on that ice roll
Yeah, that's that new shit
Bottles all white, like Obama's crib
And they still talking old gold
I just netted half a mil' from some old gold
Ralph Lauren Polo, that be the logo
Dom P, Ace of Spades, Veuve Cliquot
Champagne bath and a champagne glass
I piss champagne, that's my campaign ad
I.R.S we the M.V.P.s of the year
See them sparkles in the air, know they coming over here
We poppin' rosé, like it's Independence Day
Even though it's more bottles on the way

I'ma need more champagne
Tell the waitress grab a couple more bottles and bring 'em up
We got a bar for every nigga that came with us
You got some broads, then bring 'em up
Grab a drink and get fucked up

Cook like a chef, smoke like it's medicinal
Smell the engine burnin', you hear my tyres murk
We be poppin' corks like fireworks

VIP is full of red bottles
In the city that I come from, I'm the head honcho
Ounces full of kush, bottles full of Moët

Used to smoke blunts, now she roll planes
Quit fuckin' with her nigga, he was so lame
Says she love the taste, but she don't know the name
Drinkin' by the case, I gon' need you to bring (more champagne)
I'm with my goons gettin' liquored up
Make this money then blow it, like I don't give a fuck
Show up to the club, they brought them bottles out
You gettin' paper, you should know just what I'm talkin' 'bout
Uh, I live the life you write a song about
Bitches think I'm famous, favours come in large amounts
Standing on the table, standing on the couch

Some wan' play Queen Bee like she dumb

But if they come test we run for me gun

I fear none but my status will scare some
Haters keep makin' false accusations
Always got my name in they conversation
Disloyal fools I'm still the champion

You might win some but you just lost one

Now my attitude's turned cold
Girls sell they soul just to have my flow
Like Keyshia Cole they just need to let it go
The game to be sold and not to be told
Wisdom I hold 'til the youth gets old
To the hopeless now I'm on Hope Road
Dudes floss cash and they know they in debt
Never play the ho, Queen Bee be the pimp
Can't slick talk I done heard that shit
Can't lie to a liar I reverse that shit
I run the club called the Players Residence
I'm not only a client, I'm the president
Did the crime, now the time you can't handle it
But ima play it out to it's full out extent
I came from the Stuy project tenement
Style wild like a child off punishment
About me everyone got opinions
A lot of rap chicks but I'm still number one
Must be prepared cos the rain soon come

With the see-who's-stockin' skaters with the Lizzy's
Purpose with the deadbeats
Usually spited by my Goldilocks
While first movin' flocks I'm movin' drops
Cop the Ferrari when I'm roomin' the range
Two of the same it ain't a thang pocket the change

Why not ain't no other bitches hot in the game

Lil' Kim yeah everybody knows me
In a class by myself never where the ho's be
I just avoid where all my foes be
Cuz God damn muthafuckas is nosey
Wanna know what I'm wearing
What I'm drivin what I'm doin'
Where I hang out at who the fuck I'm screwin'
Damn I move way out to the boondocks
So I can have a little bit of privacy
You bought a tiny ass condo
Way across the water with a telescope
So you can spy on me
You clowns belong in the circus
Steady tryin' to hurt us
Tell me what's the purpose
They say I'm prejudice
The only presidents that I fuck with
Is the ones that's dead
Like the big heads
Never stingy with my Benji's
Got enough dough to buy the West Indies
Invest in Fendi's own Laurendi's
Start my own doll like Mark & Mindy's
Free all my niggas from the penitentiary
Yea keep puttin' out records till the turn of the century
Repeat 1
You got a 5 and I got a 6
Back it up
What's wrong with this picture nigga
Pack it up
I need a 6 figga nigga (uh huh)
Yours is big but mines is bigga
Cuz the Benji's is what it's all about
Do my ladies know what I'm talkin' about
If my shoes cost more than your car
Ha don't expect to get far
You the kinda nigga that like to plot
Call your friends tell em that you hit the jackpot
I keep razors in my bras
For all you womanizers
That's how much I despise it's up
I don't get it I ain't wit it
Can't see how other woman did it
Niggas screamin' gimme
Can't get a penny
Yea I got plenty
But you ain't got any?
Now picture me takin' my  hard earned money
Throwin' it away by spendin' it on a dummy
All he gon' do is spend it on another honey
I say let the nigga stay bummy
I don't need a nigga I jerks it out
Take it old school and smurf it out
Give me a B and I'll merk it out
Niggas know QB gon' work it out
Repeat 1
Nobody
As we proceed to give you what you need
In 2000 baby
And we rock on and on
All hail the Queen
All hail the King

It Ain’t My Fault,Ms. G.O.A.T.,2008.0,"Lil Kim that's more than a lil bit
Tell a nigga quit
Go 'head wit' ya lil dick
Wit' ya lil money, lil ice, and ya lil whip
You already know I'm in love with that big shit
You an imitation, I'm that real shit
Y'all just playin the greatest like Will Smith
I kill 'em with kindness, blow a lil kiss
Look like you gotta weak bladder, you a lil pissed
Uh, but it ain't my fault, the queen never left
I don't know what y'all thought
Right back to ballin'
Gettin' money is sport
And i always tell the truth even when I'm in court
New York, it ain't New York
Go on show off, drop the top on that Porsche
If everyday ya hustlin' like Rick Ross
Then you get it like a boss
No matter what it cost
Lil Kim that's more than a lil bit
Tell a nigga quit
Go 'head wit' ya lil dick

A lot of rappers act big with they lil hit
They overdoin' it more than a lil bit
Impress me, take more than a lil chips
Big things poppin' go 'head with that lil shit
Uh, I'm throwin' money in the crowd

Make ya fuck around and drown
Now them leaches ain't around

Got rid of the dead weight, like Star Jones
Sleepin on Kim
Y'all better wake up
I'm shinin' on y'all like I just opened the drapes up
Wishin' on a star but ya never get lucky
Me and Sha Money gotta rap like a mummy

ShaMoney gets more than a lil dome
Quick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal
Even though you got the kind of body niggas kill for
As I think about it, damn i hate to see you go
I tell you from the start you gotta know your part
You can't miss me at night, I glow in the dark
Look baby, I'm a rockstar, no guitar
Young, fly nigga shades on like Bret Hart
ShaMoney gets more than a lil dome
Quick to tell a bitch go and kick it like a field goal
I don't need a super woman, I just need a lil more
Lil cris, lil haze, and a lil dro
And I'm cooler than an A/C breeze
Still stomp a nigga out in my ACGs
Still run up in ya crib through that ADT
ASAP where that money at
If I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'ma go and get that duffle bag
I ain't never ran from a nigga, I ain't a runnin' back
Mike Vick ya dog, ya better muzzle that
Dang nigga, you soak a nigga like a bubble bath
You don't want none of that
We be on that bullshit
Still gettin' money man I'm good like I'm hood rich
Walk around on that ""wish a nigga would"" shit
Me and Queen Bee need more than a lil bit

Lil Kim that's more than a lil bit

Get Yours,The Naked Truth,2005.0,"Hey throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours
If the rims on his ride ain't as big as yours
You gettin money what'chu hatin on my niggas for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin yours
Throw your bottles in the sky if you're gettin yours
If that other bitch's ass ain't as big as yours
You gettin money what'chu hatin on my bitches for?
Hey get your mind off of mine and get to gettin yours

Boss lady pull up in the back of the Maybach
Chaffeur behind the wheel, feet up, leaned back
Readin the newspaper, honeygirl put a hurtin on 'em
Haters like a bad act, I just close the curtain on 'em
Play all day on the Siruis, radio
Satellite TV, who do it like me?
In designer outfits, while sellin the tag
Yves Saint Laurent boots, Yves Saint Laurent bag
Keep the Pokeman in case a big bitch think I'm ass
Eatin through her stomach like a gastric, bypass
Bitch you better buy a pass and you better have the cash
When you in my town you got to see me to buy a pass
Number one rule, think B.I.G
50 grand for the girl to sit in V.I.P
The spotlight is on me, I'm the one they wanna see
They give they money to Kim like I'm H.S.B.C

Yeah, well it's young Dash to all those who don't know
The boy who stay hot when his jewels is so cold
Killer screwface and he cockin that fo'-fo'
Wanna ice grill? Better holla at Paul Wall
Is all that called for? Whole crew do it up
Champagne, threw it up, 'til niggas threw it up
Cruisin up, tinted up, gotta be some star
Don't know what to call it, they say it's a truck car
You been with a chump pah; like Ashton
Was the first one to ""Punk"" y'all
Have yo' ass holy and resemblin Spongebob
Like an old album, you happen to come for us
You guys get dust off
It's the young boss, show you what the imp us for
Family and friends be the only ones missin boy
Sayin that you rich and all, tell me what'chu bitchin for
Maybe cause I'm gettin mine - well is you gettin yours?


You don't really want it with the nigga right in front of Tip
Have you duckin on the shit, wanna let the burner spit
Get bucked bitch, give a fuck who you run and get
King of the South, Pimp Squad Clique runnin shit
Bricks in the pipeline, sold in the nighttime
Take a lifetime to find a flow that's quite like mine
40 cal's and 45 Glocks, I don't like nine
Mac-9 and automatic flatten niggas lifeline
I'm already rich, use the rappin as a pasttime
Grand Hustle bitch and I ain't settle for the last time
Other niggas settle down cause I don't bag mine
You see me pull it I'mma blast, I don't flash mine
You niggas livin check to check but I don't cash mine
Deposit it and let it sit cause all the cash mine
Been goin easy on you rappers I'mma mash now

I’d rather see them coughing up phlegm
Off with they heads, guillotine Kim so it’s off with they limbs
Why pop cork with my men

They said queen keep doing ya thing write songs so we can quote thee

CT got your back, you know what it is
Shout out to the whole Tri-State
Shout out to all the websites, shout out to all the blogs
Shout out to all the radio stations
Most of all, shout out to the streets

It was love at first sight, everthing was right
I didn't know, him had another life with a kid and wife
And he bought me a ring and he bought us both the same cars
What started out as a simple love affair
Ended with someone inside an electric chair
And the same man that she was in love with's now in love with me
I didn't mean to hurt her, could've been somebody's mom
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station

I can't imagine what I'd do if I was in her show
'Cause if he did this to me, I'd probably kill him too
'Cause if he played me for a fool, I'd probably lose my cool
And reach for my firearm
I wish she didn't lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what she was thinking
But I know what she was feeling
And now he's no longer around
I didn't mean to hurt him, could've been somebody's son
But she took his heart when, she pulled out that gun
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
But hear me now

I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
I never thought she'd do it
Oh gosh
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why ever do she do it?
Why do she pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom!
And end this, end this life so soon
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull the trigger, boom
Now what you gon' do? Me say, what you gon' do?
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down, oh god
Ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam, ram pa-pa-pam
Me say one man down
Now you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes you are a criminal, criminal, criminal
Yes now somebody hold the gun, whilst she run out of town

Need A Bitch,Ms. G.O.A.T.,2008.0,"Who the flyest bitch in the game? (Lil' Kim)
Who be the baddest bitch alive? (Lil' Kim)
Who the sexiest chick around? (Lil' Kim)
What gangsta bitch, who ain't gon' ride? (Lil' Kim)
This for my pimps and my hoes
When they's in the Maybach, Bentley or the Rolls
I asked my nigga Nate Dogg
Outta all the ladies, why he chose the Queen Bee
And this is what he said y'all:

I need me a bitch, with some big old thighs
I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch, with some pretty ass eyes
I need me a bitch, like I need some hash
I need me a bitch, so I can floss that ho, and make my ex mad
I need me a bitch, ain't no need to lie
I need me a bitch, so when I do some dirt, she be my alibi
I need me a bitch, like a need a 6-4
I need me a bitch, that'll shine my rims up and open my door
I need me a bitch, who is all of that
Cos I'm a fly ass motherfucking nigga who was born to mac
I need me a bitch, like never before
I need me a bitch, and I couldn't care less if the bitches yawn
I need me a bitch

All eyes on the Queen, when I'm walking past
I'm in the Fendi mini-skirt, shakin' my ass
In slow motion for ya, slow motion for ya
I'm working that back daddy, how you like that daddy
Honeygirl Lil' Kim with the mac Nate Dogg
Reppin 3-1-0 to the 7-1-8 y'all
That'll have a Queen on your arm if you could
Take them wings off the Bentley, and put me of the hood
Oh, I'm what niggas want, I got what niggas need
I keep my coochi in Gucci, and you best belive
Get it on anywhere, no matter I'm looking
Sophisticated, I'm sexual so

I need me a trick, that's filty rich
I need me a fine ass motherfucking nigga with a big ass --
Cus I'm that (bitch)

I--- I need me a bitch
I--- I need me a bitch, who ain't hard to please
I need me a fine ass motherfucking bitch with some start up knees
I need me a bitch, who ain't scared to flirt
I need me a bitch, in the middle of the grocery store, so lift up her skirt
I need me a bitch, like I need my crew
I need me a bitch, a bitch, to pass on to my boys soon as I get through
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)
I need me a bitch, I love when she wildin' out, cos she still look fine
I need me a bitch, and a Coupe de Ville
I need me a bitch, a car with a big back seat, so I can make her squeal
I need me a bitch, like a need a drnk
Who can hold her breath real good, it's either swim or sink

I--- need a bitch
I--- need a bitch

Her neck and nibble 'til I'm way down on her waist kid
Man she's a freak, I'm a freak I be freakin' off
When she come in with a friend, I'm like ""Take it off!""

'Cause he'll be back tonight, and then the next night

I'll be his Advil, I gotta keep his head right
He outta town and he fiendin' for me every night
He's so addicted sendin' for me on the next flight

I'm pluck you haters nerves like a game of skelly
Yeah I might screw Nelly in the back of the deli
And y'all say the Queen don't keep it gully
She want him home by one, he ain't showing tonight
I guess ol' girl ain't throwing it right
Down down baby on the first lady
Before he bust, I'm slidin off to Slim Shady
Dear Eminem, you just don't understand
I want to melt in your mouth and not in your hands!
Your accent make me horny, you got hits
So peep the remix: your bum is on my tits
Usher, you ain't got to call
Have you singing 'U Remind Me' to a blow up doll
I'm into sports, mostly basketball
I be like, ""Ohh"" when they take it to the hole
Picture me the coach of the New York Knicks
Getting head from Sprewell, choke on this!
Sixty-nine's the position I can't resist
I'm that blunt in Snoop's mouth, smoke on this
From Chris Webber to Vince Carter, who get in the best
Competing for the Queen like a dunking contest
Yo, J to A.I., when you in Bedstuy
Make sure you holla at the K.I

Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch
It's time I show 'em what a bitch is all about, bitch
A keep it movin', keep them bitches out my mouth, bitch
From the east, to the west and dirty south, bitch
Knock 'em out the box, bitch, knock 'em out, bitch

For a million dollars a head, I'll fuck all of Cash Money
Back that thang up like a Playboy bunny
Bling bling, every time Baby hit the booty, bling bling
And Lil' Wayne run up in the cootie, ching ching
Juve' and the rest of the crew, the same thing
Hahaha, I cracks myself up
I know I talk shit, but I can back myself up
Can't believe the words I'm spittin'
Zab, I'm from Brooklyn, that's a no brainer
Why the fuck you ain't call me to be ya personal trainer
I'm just fucking with you, don't get mad, and try to spazz
Or I'll have to call that nigga Kostya Tszyu on your ass
Tyson, Sugar Shane, you boxers turn me on
Hope your dick's like your money be... real long
Just 'cuz I'm a freak and talk dirty in my songs
This pussy ain't for free, now that's where you're wrong
I take Tank to the bank, before his career sank
For me to sex him, I need about 17 drinks
Like The Artist said, I'm a sexy muthafucka
Tryna make a Rush Hour 3 porno with Chris Tucker
What about Musiq Soulchild, man I'd rather suck Bilal
And have an orgy with the whole Where Brother Art Thou

They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick? She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being Conceited
, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeeeeeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, throwin' money through the ceilin'
I get it, the lifestyle that you only rap about
I live it, my man buy cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like a Phatom, you a Honda Civic

It's me, bitches

Back up on the scene, it's the microphone fiend
Fuck keepin' it clean, I'm keepin' it real green
(WARNING) She's hazardous, ghetto-fabulous
You can't see her with binoculars (You cannot see her dawg)
I'm keepin' it Holly-hood, out in Hollywood
Put ya lighters up if you rollin' that backwood (put 'em up, put 'em up!)
Once again it's on, your girl's back in the zone
Maybe it's the beat or the seven shots of Patron
Like Cypress Hill, I'm 'Insane In The Brain'
My niggas, clear the lane, I'm comin' to bring the pain (she comin')
Time for a change, ya'll all sound the same
Ya'll all makin' it rain, we makin' it hurricane
Like a good meal, I hit the spot
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
What you cowards forgot, is stayin' on top
I'm kinda like your album, it ain't never gon' drop
Y'all got gun, and they never gon' pop
You already know the motto, ""Ain't Never Gon' Stop""
I'm always on that green light, tryna get my team right
Back to back 5-50s, that cream white
Red diamonds like a infrared beam light
My soldiers masked up like it's Halloween night
You know the apple-bottoms got the jeans fittin' tight
Marciano bra got the titties sittin' right
JT had a sexy track, but it's gon take Lil' Kim to bring sexy back
It's me the trendsetter, 24/7 Star sweater
24 karat gold on Astar leather, best thing since Donetella
We in the club and our table's bottled up like a wine cellar

My sex appeal make you stu-stu-stutter mane
My CD all in ya crib like brudda mane
I'm seasoned with all the right spices
I'm the whole pie, y'all just slices
I'm hotter than Tabasco sauce
When God make it rain. it's to cool me off

Get that money, get that money
Don't stop huggin' the block, get that money
Get that money, get that money
Don't stop huggin' the block, get that money

Cause I'm 'bout to own the charts
When I pop my collar, man I'm extra heavy on the starch
Extra heavy on the wheels, extra heavy on the watch
Jewelry like Henny, extra heavy on the rocks
My dudes on the grind, extra heavy on the block
You know I like my men extra heavy with the guap
You lookin' for the dude leavin' the club in the Gallardo
I'm lookin' for the due leavin' in the helicopter
So we can toast, overlooking the coast
Just think about that, next time you flyin' coach
Yeah I came home, little meat on the thighs
I'm eye candy, real sweet on the eyes
Yeah I fucked with Nas, hypnotized B.I
Damn, they even thought I married Jay, like Blige
But nah, nah, Kim keep two steppin'
Two-fo'-seven, is what I'm reppin'
Lil' Kim for mayor, fuck with a real bitch

Shawty is a ten, think about me in his dreams
Nymphomanic, head like a brainiac

And better than before, you thought it was impossible
Haters is sick need to check into a hospital
Prayin for my downfall like it was a Sunday
But it's over, you only get five minutes to shine
Now the game is mine
The streets crowned ya girl Miss Greatest of All Time
So follow me and I'll lead you the right way
Just sing along to the words I say, C'mon

Dude these chicks sour, getting worse by the hour
And at the same time I'm cakin' up by the minute
But when you sick a ho and I can show you 'bout pimpin'
I'm tryna put you onto game, pay attention
To how to grind, I'm bout a dollar not a dime
I'm color blind, to everything except a dollar sign
Bottom line, your career I break up
And take your shine like the feds did to Jacob
Well well well, I'll be damned

A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watchin' my cutie-pie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killin' her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, FaceTime
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand 'em the tone

Hustle Hard,Black Friday,2011.0,"(Oh shit) Another day another dollar my homie
(It's that Hustle Hard right here man)
It already snow, you know how it go (it's cold outside)
Same old shit, just a different day
I feel the Aftermath, Em' and Dre

Same old shit, just different toilet
It is what it is, sometimes I can't call it
I need another house, another coupe
I'm tryna buy a' island, so guess what I'ma do
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Closed mouth, don't get fed on this boulevard

Million dollar deposit
Half a mil' in my closet
Phantom milky white chocolate
If the roof is on then I chop it
S1 on my finger
On the steering wheel of that Beemer
I just bought the new M6, while they customised my GINA
Kimmy pull up at your party, Maybachs and Ferraris
Ducatis and Harleys, pink seats in Bugattis
Don't nothin' move 'til I say so
We all about them pesos
I.R.S. nigga we the mob
We hustle hard, cocaine dough
That Mercedes topless, ain't that bitch exotic
My men just bought me that white rose and I ain't talkin' flowers
I supplied, you worse
What you worried 'bout what I'm earning?
Money I keep burning
As the world keep turning

Same old shit, just different toilet
It is what it is, sometimes I can't call it
I need another house, another coupe
I'm tryna buy a' island, so guess what I'ma do

Welcome to W.P.I.M.P. T

How the f**k do you get in the industry and then stay there

Got my own Gucci store, beside of my home
And if you, don't understand my actions
Just know there's a method to my madness


Some MCs are old and arrogant
Try to make a name by dissing and competing
Niggas just like to spend cash
Cum fast, cos my pussy's so sweet
A diabetic wanna eat it first
Some people hate, and choose to talk trash
I brush it off and let it pass, like Steve Nash
Quick, fast, I get up in that ass
Kim's fast, and put hole on four blasts

Then I picture my father
When he looked at his son
He understood his story

Flip ten million zips
Or I can parlay with puff
And make a 10 million flip
I been a boss and you know it
Make a mill and I blow it
I had a dream I would sell
And in July it was snowin'
Went and caught me a bird
Momma, pray for my blessings
Niggas fuck with my nerves
Talking fast with them questions
First spray was the ball
Worse fear was the verdict
Fill that mill and desert it
But the block was deserted
Talkin' 500 murders
About 100 I knew
I'm talkin' 500 cases
About 400 that blew
You lost it all in a day
But you been grindin' the longest

I sip that crystal shit and smoke a L and at the same time
Tryin to strategize how to get this paper
More money, more haters
Especially when you ain't the average bitch
Cause I'm a boss (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some ""get it how you get it""
You know, ""money over niggas""-type thing
I got these rap dames turnin green like they want it with the queen Ms G.O.A.T, never stressin, tell these bitches better fight for second
Even though it gets lonely at the top
Anything is better than being back on the block
Cause don't nobody know it's Kimberly Jones then the Queen B
Know what I mean?
Every now and then I start trippin and get to thinkin bout BK thugs in the pj's or my peoples (yeah I know what you mean)
That's living illegal
Don't let niggas mislead you, the streets is evil
Ain't nobody in the game stuntin like we do
I'ma make it to a bill, trust this
Just give me some time like the judge did
If you hatin, y'all can get the middle finger, fuck it is Nathan
Kiss em, thats my pussy you tastin
Amazing, Queen B in the place
My thoughts paint pictures y'all just copy and trace
Don't fuck with the fake or talk about em (uhn huh)
Fuck the law always kept it hardcore like my first album

In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm

The '68's quick to tag plates, i'm straight
Stay great, the diamonds and pearls
Forever always, the million dollar girl (Uh)

Street dreams are made of these
850 IS and GS3s
You travel the world tryna sling a ki
Everybody's looking for something

I got no time for fake niggas (Uh, what? That's right)
You drink a little wine, but you shake, nigga
See, my name's on your lease with your bank figures
'Cause I'm much more advanced than them average gold diggers
Yeah, it figures; you're talking 'bout me, so what about you? (Uh)
Man, bitches be lying too
I push the ki's, GS3s, the papes (Woo)
Yeah, I ride crate state to state, lieutenant takes mad dimes
From New York to Anaheim (Uh, uh-huh)
While you daydream and whine
I just keep gettin' mine (Gettin' mine)
And I'm, married to this (Woo)
Y'all strategy lists and still planning weddings (Uh)
Mafioso threatens all the bullshit
Any type of threat, ends to pull shit (What?)
That's why I got mad love for my real bitches
Kisses and hugs, yo, one love to my thug niggas (Uh-huh)

Street dreams are made of these
850 IS and GS3s
You travel the world tryna sling a ki
Everybody's looking for something, uh

Right back at ya, you know the one Cleopatra
All up in that ass, digging in your stash
Niggas think they gon' get some ass
No money money, no licky-licky (Uh)
Fuck your dicky-dicky and your quickie
Gimme your loot, your MAC-11 didn't shoot
Your game ain't sweet, John Paul Pete shouldn't compare
If you can't wed it (What?), forget it, don't sweat it (What?)
I bet it, make it come smooth if you let it
You can't stop a bitch from ballin' (Ballin')
Haha, the lala, the drop-off, they be callin'
Uh, Cease-A-Leo, uh

Street dreams are made of these

Back Together Again,The Unreleased Tracks,2013,"Uh, it's going out to all the pimps and macs
Y’all know the flavour, Brooklyn style
You know how we do, uh, yeah
All the macs and the dons in the house
Playa playaz, playa, playa, let these hoes know
One, two

Is it true, all I wanna do is screw?
Drink brew, with the crew, on the avenue? Ooh!
I flip skins like Mary Lou
So what ya gonna do when (Biggie) come for you, boo
I got girls that look like Toni Braxton
And give me the skins without askin'
When I'm relaxin’ on my back and you know what time it is, uh
But if it's red man, I'll leave it alone
She can call me on my cellular phone
And I mess around and pick you up
Take you to the crib, stick you up
Put on my Silk CD and lick you up and down
'Til you say stop, hit the twat, 'til your pops call the cops
And when I make bail outta jail, I'ma wail on that tail (Why, Big?)
Because the sex never fails, I am

So amazing (Uh)
So amazing (Uh)
So amazing (Playa, playa)
And I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons (Baby)
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

Biggie taught me how to ride dick
Cut ’em off, freeze ’em, them use 'em as ice picks
Hard times, baby; got honeys out of state
Doing 2-to-8 for first degree rape
What I can’t get, I take
Her name hold weight (What you say?)
Like I said: my name hold weight (Uh), pussy is the bait (Uh)
Around the way they call me the Pink Panther
I'm your private dancer
If he giving up the bread, I'm taking him home
He can lick me like an ice cream cone
Pop that coochie like I'm a loog boochie (Oww)
Tap her on the booty ’til he sweat out my doody
Niggas show up with 10 carats in the ring
You know I got that thing that make a nigga wanna sing:
""Girl, let's just get married, I just want to get married""
That's why they call me the queen, 'cause I am

So amazing (Uh)
So amazing (Uh)
So amazing
And I been waiting
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons (Baby)
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm
This is for the macs and dons

This is going out to the pimps and macs (Uh, uh)
That hit skins 'til their broad catch a asthma attack
But not even Pamatti Miss could resist
The way Lil' Kim put this on your lips
All I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom
Let's smoke a little boom and head straight to the bedroom
And then I whisper soft in the ear
Yeah, I love you too, my Big Poppa Bear
You know I leave you pussy-whipped
I whip that pussy
Well, hit it from the back 'til it get real gushy, baby
Good sex is what I'm startin'
I get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'
And I pray that the dick don't slip
'Cause then I'm hearin' this shit (That's not it)
And then I just ride 'til the sun rise
And when I'm done I wipe the cum on her thighs, I am

So amazing (Uh)
So amazing (Uh)
So amazing  (Uh)
And I been waiting

Bitches got the audac-ity
Tryin to say they gettin cash like me, get ass like me
You couldn't be as classy as me
Even if you roll a Eva curtain
And diamonds on the surface it just defeats the purpose
Hoe, I'ma double bitch
I lick dicks sometimes for the hell of it
Who stack chips like computers never celibate
Stash weed in Bermuda
Look around, look around, the room's empty
So, I guess that be me
The Queen B, Double E
I keep my foes close
Like I used to chop my hoes close
But this cat named Gicanno's
Who used to call me bag lady
Cause if you lick me from my
Index finger to the thumb, it shouldn't stay numb
See, I live this life, you wish this life
Dream this life, of royals
Motherfuckers got you gas motor spoiled
So what you gonna do when you run out of oil?
Crumble like the foil
This goes out to you
Sealed with a kiss, the Queenuesche

Gotta get that money
I won't let no one put me in a box

But I'm not what they think I am
Instead of hatin' on what you see
Come get to know me
I'm done with playin' by the same ol' rules
Ya girl over here makin' major moves
Sick and tired of the same ol' dudes
I smell new money
I know I like to dance sleezy
No, but that don't mean that I'm easy
First he gotta know how to please me
And I'll be there if he needs me
But I won't let no man put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to the top

Uh, oh, uh, oh, uh

If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A., you wanna be 'em
Most of y'all niggas can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch, on and on, on and on

I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen

Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch! Uhh
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch
Shit I'm rich, I'ma stay that...

I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
