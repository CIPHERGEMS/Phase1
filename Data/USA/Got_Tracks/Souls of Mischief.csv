’93 ’Til Infinity,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"Yo, whassup? This is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (Yo, yo, yeah)
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometime,s it gets a little hectic out there
(Haha, we just chilling)
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget
; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler
, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too! (Too)
I'll front you (You), if you hang with a bunk crew (Chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this (Yep)
I need not explain this (Nah)
A-Plus is famous, so get the Amos

Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great–let's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre (That's nice shit)
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball,
 ‘cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

Huh, my black Timbs do me well (Yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (What?)
Another person's busy-ness, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch

Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
They hit blunts and flip once
I'm chillin', ‘cause my crew's close, kid

I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, ‘cause I'm an exception to the rule (Or not!)
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee
Blam leakin' out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, ‘cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 to infinity–kill all that wack shit!

Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til (Uh-huh)
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til (Yeah)

I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit
With my own clique,
 
roll many backroads
With a fat stog' and blunts,
 foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'
Niggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh, and …

Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid (Get off!)
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some ill fits, some new kicks
I often do this, ‘cause it's the pits not being dipped

Flipped! The flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The ex...traordinary, dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! (Shit)
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see, from now 'til infinity

Ahhh (Yeah), this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Huh! This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah! This is how we chill from 93 'til
Aww, yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Haha! Just coolin' out, y'know what I'm sayin'?
But, but who's chillin' around the land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, Plus
Casual–you know he's chillin'
Yo, Pep Love–he gotta be chillin'
Jay-Biz–you know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, my—my man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike G–you know he's here chillin'
Yeah, my man Mike P–you know he gotta chill
Del the Funky Homosapien is chillin'
Aye, aye, my man Domino–yo, he's chillin'
Yeah…& it's like that, yeah
Yeah, ill
I could do that
You know what I'm saying? Peace",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-93-til-infinity-lyrics
Step to My Girl,Hiero Oldies Vol. 1 ,2003.0,"Back back, way back, I used to fret that my honey
Would play me for one with more 
papes
, still it was funny
Cause she paid no mind as jerks lurked constantly
And my insecurity turned into maturity (I matured)
As the years pass I find it hard to be monogamous
So do other brothers, so the scene's still synonymous
Catch crazy glares when I'm with female company
Some think I'm a softie and they step to her in front of me
So in public places I am often found in my trunk
Reaching for bats, and smack goes his spunk
Because I have the right to 
riff
, and in spite
Of a few protests, progress and I might smite you
Once you come, 
your fronts
, they got no future
Blunts blur my sight, get left and right suture
I know this, and also notice advances:
I peeped them papers in which he slipped to 
my dip
With numerals, and you're soon to roast thinking I'm jelly
Cause numbers left in the gutter lead to lonely tellies (telephones)
(God damn, why won't she call?)
Cause we see who's pee-wee and we see who's me
The difference is Vaseline: You're slipping while I'm skin-dipping
Grips, and grips of chumps my way:
Slumped from back-bumps on rumps, cause I flay
So why play, cause Tajai has to flip
I found mine, so find your own companionship

Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy. Why is that?

Brothers get jealous when I'm chilling with my dip
Just because she's flyer, you try to, 
play me like Milton Bradley
I'm mad, G, just because you've gotta settle for Maggie
Or Agnes, maybe Mathilda the Witch, yo
I'mma have to beat you if you call her a bitch, yo
Keep your mind off what's mine for the keeping (yup)
Or I'll put a bomb in your house while you're sleeping (boom!)
Keep your distance, Hiero is watching you
Step by step, I never slept, I gots to do lots
Cause you brothers never respect who you should (me)
Try to be my friend, and it might do you good (yeah)
Get down with the program, hey yo man yo
Don't even look at my girl on a slow jam
Of course not, you'll never get that close (nah)
To her soft skin, rest in a coffin
If you ever disrespect, I'll twist your neck
If I've got a bat, I might get pissed and flex (boom)
Cause your tramp ain't got a stamp of approval
When I get mine with this rhyme, your crew will
Have to learn the hard way, I'll have to slam you like Hammer
So I bet you'll all break
Even though his song is wack, mine's not
Your girl will never get the props that mine got

Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy. Why is that?

I'm the brother stepping with the flyer female companion
Others be scheming or scamming, dreaming, planning, plotting
Trying to make moves when I'm not in the vicinity
I'll fill that ass with splinters, see
Pull a wood bat, would that change your disposition?
Wishing you was in my position, kissing and hugging on a goddess
But I stay humble and modest
Brothers want to rumble, but they stumble and fumble
Cause they get pummelled by the mischievous
You might catch a whiff of this sneaker
Seek the company of my sweet senorita?
Swing a bat like 
The Natural
, break your clavicle
Fracture femurs, as you scream I'm overcome with laughter
I'm the champion, my man slaps me ten
Cause he's twice as nice, twice the jealousy
Cause fellas see they don't suffice
Opio Lindsey spins the spinal cords
Of the hordes of the Huckleberry Finns
My knuckles are buried in chins
Cause it offends when you're stepping
Adrenalin is pumping, I thump chumps with my weapon
Moments of tranquility abruptly have to cease
Walking hand in hand, when one feels he has to speak his peace
Should I pull a piece and unleash a couple of bullets?
Would it persuade a brother to turn his head and foot it
In the opposite direction, throat sets in his chin
Recognized that I fooled him

Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy. Why is that?
Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
Everytime she sees you
She could just take off
And you could just let off steam by screaming
No, no, nooo",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-step-to-my-girl-lyrics
Cab Fare,Hiero Oldies II ,2001.0,"Yo, the jam was fly, oh my now it's over
My batch of pals cut so Tajai must catch a
Taxicab, dag nab why'd they leave me
Stuck in the late night alley, Cali's
Not so hot that everyone should be sweating
Yet nobody's smiling plus crews are piling
Staring, thinking what they'd look like wearing
My gear, I sighed when the yellow cab neared
He sped up cos dreads made him think I'd vic him
Now I gotta dodge thugs like I'm playing chicken
An Englishman, an Irishman
Five or ten Caucasians passed me in their taxis
Oh no such luck I'm gonna get bucked for my apparel
As I seen the black gauge barrel
Just then a fat cab came to my rescue
Damn I'm glad black men drive them cabs too

It seems nowadays cab rides are rather pricely
Especially when the driver goes for self
In spite of the directions that are given
They are driven to cruise backstreets
That treats them to a pricely fare, exactly
What happened to myself when I chose to call a taxi
It pulled up to the curb and I hopped into the backseat
Gave him the destination, said he'd never heard of the place
And I'd have to tell him as we went along, and then placed it in drive
When I said make a left he made a right
Alright, I get it, you wanna make some slight
Detours so you can be sure that you get yours
And when I turn my head you up the bill a little more
I told the cabbie to stop, he didn't think I watched it
Fake reached into my pocket and then jetted like I was Rocket
Ismail his tail light was broken as a token of appreciation
He started chasing but I smoked him

What? You can't escape me
Mop head, drop dead, deceased
Say your final summons if I catch you
Bet you regret you ever ditched me
Driving, conniving
Guys been robbing me lately
He went up Blake Street
But I'm following, swallowing up steps
He ran to the left, I made a left and crashed
Into a rose bush, my nose crushed on impact
But yo, I'll get him back

I didn't have enough for a car, what a bummer
I had to get a job driving taxis last summer
All the other drivers knew that my car was spectacular
Cause I had a tight, very bright yellow Acura
Piling in 9 or 10 skins at a time, G
Funny how the honeys with the money always find me
Paying their green to see what color my house is
Feeling like Del cause they would sleep on my couches
I'd charge senior citizens extra, cause they never mention
I'd take all the money from they pension
And I'd drive a blind man around for a while
Even if he only had to travel just a mile, with a smile
And don't let your dog off the leash
Cause if he stepped then I would have to squash the beast
And if you didn't have the right change, don't even ask me
Or I would have ran your ass down with my taxi",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-cab-fare-lyrics
Never No More,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"Never no more, never no more
Never will a sucka score, never no more
Never no more, never no more
Never will a sucka score, never no more

Message recorded, lessons be stored in
This mental core, it's 
like lentil porridge
Nas-ty
, Massey, be the last g
From medical texts to class me
Ask me, if I had to grip my pad
The riffs I'd grab would rip and stab
The kids that sad, the shit that's drab
And flavorless, and reckless
Your bestest behavior gets
I plays the hits, displays the shit
A razor gets parlayed amidst
And later splits a Philly that
I made ya hit
, a relief that I gave to kids
When I punched them
I crunch men, at a function

Ponder on this, 
I swallowed the spliff with locution
Encompassing the pompous means, when I escalate my tool
Shins get split, men get spindled, swiveled, pivoted
By my riveting centrifuge
I'm swindling crews, bringing a fist to bruise
Pulverizing skulls annihilating trifling dunces
Pulling rifle pumps to stifle punks when my knifes'll
Split your spleen hit you clean in the kisser
When I twist a riddle I'm breakin' the brittle
And flimsy with my whimsy
Puns and phrases I stun in phases
Terrorize 'em, paralyze 'em paraplegic, when I leave 'em
Mindless, spineless, vertebrate-less with meningitis
I earn 'em swift and minus a life with my nine


I get the props, you get the buttocks
I know my what-nots, 
stopping flows like blood clots
Nah, cuz that's a bad word in jamaican
And I am that,
 fans pack cuz my jams phat
So get the 
peanut
 butter we discover treasure
It's sweet when I stomp you with my feet just for pleasure
Cuz I write the rhymes like a slave'll pick the cotton
The best from the west
 cause I'm fresh and you're rotten
Take out the trash or I'll take it out your ass
With a blast from the past in the future
, I'll shoot ya
But for the present beatdowns will suffice
Lose cause you choose to be down with some mice
You dumb dunces I come once it's my time to
Wanna hear a joke? I'm you
Don't you wish, I won't dismiss your treachery
I bet you'll be, leaving upon a stretcher, g

I'm coming tighter, your rhymes are alright-a
Little reminiscent of the poetry I write
A-stoundingly, you're sounding like me, might we
Step outside and settle this, I cause catastrophes
I laugh at these cause my shit is astonishing
Demolishing, you and your following, I'm swallowing
MCs like I was a black hole, ransack those
Wack flows who chose to oppose
I dont suppose, dare or where my stubble grows
Reverses the process, God bless you swing and whoa its you!
Opio, disposes of crews like snotty tissues
I rip through bodies with corkscrews, you wish you never tried

That’s When Ya Lost,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"Yo, I find it fun to smash emcees into fine bits
I’m goin' to get my just desserts for all the kids I must’ve hurt
I trust that courtesy when dealing with folks is too much for the asking
Cool: I got the skill crafted tools
Massive fools at my work bench and
I'm wrenchin' mics from they grasp 'n'
That's how it has been
The drill's this: I kill swift
I feels I better slay or, hey
My tape measures greater
So now I'm askin' dips if they saw me and they was available
Would they want me to nail 'em all?
Be through, screw, drive her crazy; nut and bolt, lively
Put on your high beams

I proliferate a quicker fate to niggas, vigorous
Figure I kick stunts; I punch twice that nigga that's dissin' at me
Attach 'em to bats, latchin', and matchin' my cataclysm
I give'em a schism, I stroke to croak her, I broke her
Chokin' up on my syntax, as I bend backs by im-impacts
Then I give a concussion in your nuts when I'm bustin'
Heads, dead with my lead graff
I cloth thee, I swing off-beat, off the
Cerebellum, swellin' membranes
Ten brains couldn't parallel this
I'm carouseling kids while they wallow and swallow hollow tips
You follow and slippin' -I'm rippin' mics nice twice like dicin' kids in fractions
Yo, figure, I tax men

Steppin' to Casual (That's when ya lost)
What about Domino? (That's when ya lost)
But if you step to Snupe (That's when ya lost)
Steppin' to A-Plus (That's when ya lost)
If you play the Tajai (That's when ya lost)
Man, steppin' to Opio (That's when ya lost)
Steppin' to Phesto (That's when ya lost)
Fuck with Toure' (That's when ya lost)

Yo, I'm willin' to bet, you're willin' to sweat
But illing'll get you - bruised, I kill and I step to crews
And abuse two's and three's, who's the G's that hoes know? (Me)
Me and Hiero, I know, I'm fly, bro
So why flow if you're not invigorating?
I know where you live; there at your crib, I got niggas waitin'
I figure raping is crime, see
I take my time B, and now your G is my G
Now I'm gonna show you how the West Coast smacks kids
Yo, I'm rhyming swell, so to hell with a wack diss
Generalizing, dissing before you've ever seen this
So you can get the middle (What middle?)
The penis

Never the match the miraculous tactics
I smack tricks, the wax is at your wack bitch
I crack bricks over dicks
Who can't come, I leave'm broke and dumb
Def, and plus I'm causin' cardiac arrest, you need some rest
Check, as I'm chiselin' riddles in your memory
Remember me? I hacked your body to pieces disassembling your flows
You bros started trembling from shock and trauma
I'm gonna, end lives when I bomb a
Babbling dyslexic, I make 'em exit
This lifetime, I wake up words, I excite rhymes
I'm enthusin' when I'm bruisin'
Hoes take off their shoes when I abuse men
You're losin'

If you slept on Del (That's when ya lost)
Steppin' to Pep love (That's when ya lost)
Fuckin' around with J-Biz (That's when ya lost)
Step to Mike G (That's when ya lost)
Smoke on that crack rock (That's when ya lost)
The Souls of Mischief (That's when ya lost)
When you don't know where you're goin' (That's when ya lost)
When you don't win! (That's when ya lost)
Fuckin' around with Hieroglyphics (That's when ya lost)
If you fuck with The Shamen (That's when ya lost)

Make Your Mind Up,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"Take your time recline and make your mind up
Take your time recline and make your mind up

Hieroglyphics is gonna twist a kid's cerebellum
If he lives, then I tell 'em, I'll leave his head swellin'
When tellin' fellas about the 5-6
Live, it's me investigatin' fly chick's privates
I got a plan, I got a plan, a strategy
Adam be mad a G, mad at me 'cause I got a fatter salary
Actually, you will be cookin' like bottom ramen
Never top, 'cause you'll never stop the atom bombin'
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, don't copy
The manuscript - man, you slipped, you're sloppy
Joe Schmo, never no more, I'm clever and you're
Never gonna score cause I'm sure I'm better and pure
Like cannabis, and if it's possible I'll drop a new
Line with the lyrics, live is the spirit
And soul, I got plenty in me, eeny-meeny-miny-mo
Slo-Mo, approach with yo ho, yup
'Cause I'm the man and you can read it in Genesis
A-D-A-M, the A-P-L-U-S
One and the same, runnin the game on fly chicks
Real tight, so they feel right with the 5-6
And it's like that, and that's how it is, G
The skins I cross get tossed like a frisbee
Search and find lines of life in my scripture
Screens make me seen so the keen get the picture

Take your time recline and make your mind up
Take your time recline and make your mind up

Eruptions, and busting, when I'm thrusting, cuts men
Into microscopic particles, molecules, atoms
Attack 'em, hack 'em, never slow, never slack
I'm invincible  the flow is intense at fools
Who know not, flow not like this wizard
Ya play with it, fiddle
Widdle a hole in ya throat and pull out ya gizzard
Trachiotomy, I slaughtta the watery-weak
Ya slips, there's a slobbly geek
Niggas tweek when I speak, they retreat
Rethink what was spoken and then repeat
My feat, of inhuman capabilities, rape and pillage emcees
Then I kill emcees, who have no style
I file niggas down to the cuticle
Who can feel my foot prints
Soot gets kicked in your eye, beautiful
Blinding, winding, up and change-ups
Rearrange punks, when I drops, kerplunk!
Rip chunks, out the mic, and then digest, why test?
I'm cavin' in your chest when I express
Myself, extreme confusion
You think you're losin' your mind
'Cause my rhyme cuts holes like a nine

Take your time recline and make your mind up
Take your time recline and make your mind up

Tajai, two syllables, easy
With ease, we, seize thee, butt emcees B
Cause they come wacker than Batman's sound effects
I ground your text, but vertebrae wack I pound your necks
Sally bone, I be prone to Rip shit, likely
Believe it or not, believe it I got the cock-D
Cacophony, I cap the phonies, so there is no needs
For meager attempts, deceivers and pimps know I be
Accelerating on that scale, bats pale the countenances
Of countless knit-wits who wished this
Would mishit, but this shit's equipped with
Homin' devices that are precise as they get, kids
Target's stuck to foes who pose muchly
Fronts be phucked and punk nuts rank us amongst thee
Punks we often cross when soft men
Is the image portrayed to them, spinach is no saviour when

To break spectacles, you can't see me
You're feelin' queezy and uneasy
Steppin cautious because you're nauseous
I squashes emcees like I was Colossus
Flippin on Magneto, never metal, without my bending
Ending all existance, my rhymes blending

Crews are dying while the mack keeps shining
Gleaming, girls are screaming, cuz I'm arousing
My styles bring, ___ kids, so hot you lookin drowsy

I dip a Swisher, to my kisser

Keep it jam-packed

It's over me, I am enough to rip it flat, and pass

Making blood spill and your eyes fill with puss
When I bust

Here I go again
Return of the Jedi, red eye
Use my lightsaber to take guys that pick my flavor

And squash rhymas to vapor

So crawl back under your rock
Get off my jock

Yo y'all wanna know about hoes?
Check it out... yo

Adam is the man that got more honeys than a hive of
Bees, I skeeze, I'm pullin stunts like MacGyver
And I try ta, always be patient with a Miss
But I diss 'cause groupies always seem to make me pissed
Huh, they gotta be frontin', wantin' to start a phony friendship
I never pretend, the thing I befriend be them hips
And send dips, back to they moms with a grin
But if she's a boo boo head I tell no-one that I got in

Yo, skins friends I got a lotta, and I gotta
Bend them and then blend all the hottie
Spurts be burstin like a mile a minute
'Cause I can either take it slow or yo I wild up in it
I'm pulling, yes 'cause fully dressed or threadbare they're nice
I twist my sides to tickle thighs when my head's there
I now rips sets so foul dips spread my rep
I sew the girls up like Schweppes, so many kids might fret

Afterwards I'm bouncing dips like tits on chicks
Who be running track, but they be running back for more
Rest assured, it's absurd for her to be on linger
I get the finger, 'cause she can't get the stinger
Any longer, my dong can stretch and I'm stronger
I got the daddy ding-a-ling to get you hot and bothered
Get the kinks out when my stink in the pink shout and scream
But a second fling is but a dream

From day one I played hoes in the schoolyard, my tool heartless
But not for dips submerging it ain't hurt men to merge in
My status, from baddest to Tims, I'm pulling more hips
Than gravity, and after the skins get hit, I'm drowsing
Arousing the next dousing the next gals in my saliva
The liver ones 'cause I don't strive to run in no dumb females
Some be swell, but, my picks so why tricks
Get restricted to flicks with boo boo heads, I screw you dead

I call myself the man (Repeat 8X)

Niggas cling, and get attached to things on the fluke
That's insane, I just be in and bang, get boots
For gosh sakes, that broad shakes, her thang to the whole game
The way the labia lips hang it's a sad shame
Clapping when you're tapping, just hit the scraps and be at 'em
The breasts sag like they're saddened
The skins are wrinkled, dry, worn and battered
Leave her shattered, she's as fly as a maggot

The him I am, the man I'm him
Bustin' skins out, I been stout, erect
Checkin' dips when I'm wreckin' lips and clitorises
Hit her with this 
Swinging from my you-know-what
So you know butt cheeks are clapping
Tapping the guts on the late with your date makes my ego flip
Read those lipstick marks on my penal tip
They don't lie, penis trip your dip to her thighs
Fly is my description, wise, when I'm making them lips bend

I hit it, I did it, I admit it
I never quit it, yes, I knock the boots like I was Riddick
Bowe, get with it, ho, I get with
No, Boomerang broads with nasty toes
Keep your corns on your husk you muskrat
But if she's fly, I try to bust that
Gluteus maximus, I wax and bust
I'm taxin' just to be the mack man Plus

Once I been with women, friendship done been the sole outcome
How come skins can't work their way in?
The question resting late night at her pad and
Scheming to grabbing season, 'cause she's in
I fiend, getting mad horny, transforming charges
Into swinging me, seemingly hard miss
Let her know that I was on it
Now I got dibs on that crib, I'm welcome back 'cause I'm Kotter

I call myself the man (Repeat 8X)",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-a-name-i-call-myself-lyrics
What a Way to Go Out,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"I wanna join a gang
They'll have my back with gats
We'll walk in packs and stack g's
But yo, I lack these qualities
I gotta kill a fool, steal his wallet, keys, and ID's
But I need encouragement
Initiation ain't enough for me to snuff an innocent fool
Yo I got school on Monday
So one way, or another I'mma fell bad
I need to gain acceptance cuz my reps' been in the trash can
I'm blasting, asking can I join, cuz the big night's here
I got a slight fear I might hear gunshots in my direction
Cuz the slums got a ton of niggas flexing
I started stepping and there stood this young girl
Loaded my hollow tips and followed the dip
Pulled my shotty on the hotty and I blasted the bitch
Wish I woulda known it was my little sis

Niggas wanna step, let 'em, I'm gonna get 'em
Pull the trigger finger then I wet 'em
I learned that from my pops, now I wanna pop cops and shit
Slang hots and rocks to hit
Get mine the only way possible
I gots to pull stunts, but niggas starts some bull
Cool, can I kill 'em? of course I can
I know I can, because 
I call myself the man
I'm out cruising the block that I own smoking a Swisher
When all the rocks are gone, I will be richer
Fiends keep me paid, the shade is mine to lounge in
To broke niggas how's that sounding?
Niggas wish they had my ends
- even my friends
They look with envy as I step out of my Benz
Here I am, then they sprayed me
Hey, G, I never thought nobody'd fade me- yo I went out
 ""What a way to go out, out like a sucka""

My man, peep it, I used to keep this
Huge shank inside my bomber for drama
On the ave, my boy checked me
Let me know he didn't see me as a v-e-t
Nigga, I said see that bitch at the ready-teller getting cash?
Bet that ass I'mma kill her
Gotta let these niggas know I ain't no sucka
Pulled out the shank, grabbed the bank, then I stuck her
What the- why did I fade her?
I shoulda saved it, put it in my pocket for later
But hey, the crew knows I'm true, though- that counts
Plus I got back when I'm out
Chillin, 
I get top b-illin
Until with my lil' friends the cops caught me
God-D, the sentence they gave me
I'm in the pen with no clout, but yo, I didn't go out

Holy mackerel, 
that girl got the fat booty
Like Pam Grier,
 these niggas is square
So I stepped near with no fear
I drive a Lexus,
 
she got the Nexxus flowing hair
To make a nigga wanna stare
Kicked the Cassanova then I drove her to my castle
Got the freak undressed with no hassle
The butt was firm, made the funky worm stiffen
Reached for my condom, damn, a fat rip in
The packaging, the lubrication was all dried up
Hope that the rubber don't ride up
Posted in the wallet for eons, the neon green was faded
Broke on the first stroke, I shoulda waited
A year later, caught the flu from Sonya
Shot through the clinic, they said it was pneumonia
Caused by HIV breaking down the immune system
(That was my motherfuckin man, damn I miss him)

Anything Can Happen,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"Yo
It's like this and only this
So I'm go'n tell
Me and my moms in front of the mall, and then I seen this nigga, Ramel
From fifth grade
I knew this kid was swift
Paid was how his mind logged, so he got his grind on
But now it's years later
I say ""Hey"" ta him
He flash his fronts fulla Au, and ""Hey you!""
The warning drove from a Seville as it sped by
Lead fly, ratta-tat-tatted, his blood spattered
I strive ta, see the driva with my eye
Moms grabbed sky, and caught lead in her thigh, I
Put her behind the trash can, dashed to my man
It was too late, it's sad that Ramel was perferated
Waited and sweated, for the medics as my moms bled
Even if he was alive at the scene, by now my man Ram's dead
The cops do not care
Cause our skin has too much shade in it'
They'll dismiss this as some niggas misbehavin'
But I'll never forget the driver of that blue Seville
And live for the day to bust shots in his grill
But still, I can't do this alone
My crew's blind, so I slip two dimes into the pay phone

I'll stay home, get some rest, call my girl an'
Tajai's on the phone, talkin' about the world's end
What happened?
Ya moms got capped an' ya nigga's dead?
Ya talkin' about paybacks, and bullets in the head?
Well 'um, hoodz come in dozens, but I got cousins
That live around the block, an' they got a Glock
An' we can swiftly bust 'em
I trust 'em
Wit my life, an' plus the Glock is light, an'
Easily concealed, easy it'll peel a cap right
Hey Tajai, don't stop, rap too tight (?????)
(Opio: Yo Taj, man, you a'ight, man?)
(Tajai: Yeah, let's just get dem niggas)
Maintain composure, hit the doja
Pick a book up
Don't be shook up, I got hook up
Look up my ManiPhesto, I need the special
Teams for the schemes, get A-Plus so he can brings
The blueprints
To the residence
The measurements and features
We're gonna cause explosions wit Clorox Bleach an'(Boom!)
Ping pong balls, hear through walls with a stethascope
Tap their phones, watch their every move with a telescope
Peep their favorite spots, inventing plots for their demise
On the DL, make sure, to the crimes, we have no ties

Around about noon I got a buzz on my ringa (Ring)
What a humdinga, what happened to Tajai's momma?
Goner was some kid named Ramel
My mission was to flip the aparrel, escaping by my coattails
An' from Thrifty
Swiftly lift the ping pong balls in hand
I ran where I was most suspected to be founded
Bounded up my pals and snuffed the ruffnecks who buck tips
Hollow and follow and trace every single face
Then deface them anyway we could
Infecting, injecting
HIV needles might be feeble, but
We was not wit the consequences being much worse
A-Plus, will adjust the plan to work with no quirks

Ten o'clock, on the dot, meet around the block
From his crib, we can get this kid shot, plus I got
His sister on my tip, she says she's ready to try us
Let's get her, an' break off all her fingers wit some pliers(Nah, that's
Ill)
Anyway, Tajai, jet around to the back, an'
Be strapped, since it was ya moms you should gat that
Criminal
Shoot him in his kneecaps first
Don't waste no time, you see that grill, remember we blast first
Opio and Phesto, let's go get the south window exits
In your Lexus is the moment we should flex, it's
Definately on, I bust one to the front
We got the exits covered, there's no way that he can run
The stupid nigga ran to the back like I expected
Tajai said skip the knees, saw his grill, he shot and wrecked it
Death is what he got, yo he shot, an he started all the cappin'
But now he knows: Anything Can Happen!",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-anything-can-happen-lyrics

Ain't no way to count all the flights I'm takin'
Chillin' in Australia with them white Jamaicans
In Tokyo I wasn't relaxin' when I smoked
They throw the book at you if they catch you with a roach
International ladies be givin' up the numbers
Homie get around like Christopher Columbus
And they know I'll be back like Arnold
Act carnal soon as I slam the car door...
That's hard fo' a lot of brothers but not me
You could watch the Travel Channel probably spot me
And I'm very thankful I ain't gotta be cocky
But I'm flyer than a motherf**ker somebody stop me

Eating baked Alaskan steaming a bag o' droll
Schemin' on stacks of dough either it's fast or slow
Steadily as we go better react
Now you could walk like a zombie or monster mash
While your braindead mommy give me all the cash
Get that fake broad freakin' like Nate Dogg singin'
Without the grapes or the eight ball drinkin'
Playboy Bunnies with O' snappin' pictures
Cuz I got the gift of gab like Blackalicious
And your African princess acting different
If you ever disrespect you’ll have to get shit checked

Buzzed off the Grey Goose then the Patron come out
Woods roll way loose and they flowin' around
And Woods whole day booze when I'm patrollin' the crowd
Cuz they can hold they booze and fo' sho goin' put out
I used to stand in they shoes and hope to get out
Fools had to pay dues finally broke us some ground
Now my toes'll touch ground, where the seasons is opposite

Sugar water got a mule kick em' back on land
Uncle Ron played the guitar for forty years

Limitations,93 Til Infinity,1993.0,"Understand this man is the grand-est
The mighty dreaded, niggas step and get beheaded
Shredded, left a battered broken man
Chosen hand busted from the tussle from the mic which I ignite
Like a pyromaniac don't play me
 that's
Not recommended, you're winded your girl lays me back
And I attack the twat viciously
Got it twitchin, she's a bitch to the dopefiend beat
Hope we meet in the next lifetime
For the strife I'm, the nigga with the better rhyme
Hoes think I'm adorable, 
MC's think I'm oracle
Foolish mortal, I got the flows so call your crew
And crush the earth's crust because I bust
Thunderous, I'm breakin niggas down to dust
The rhyme sorceror forces you to shout my praises
Phenomenal phrases hit you like exploding razors

Now who put the West up on the map?
Perhaps you should run laps, you're wack with a stack of dumb raps
Thumbtacks mark your headquarters
You're dead when I slaughter, and now your head's leaking red water
You shoulda been a donor, I'm prone to bone ya ho
Though she know I can flow, cuz I showed her
And now she's up on my shit, I'm slick
I rhyme quick, and I'm the shit, dick
Hieroglyphics in the house like punishment
Who is running shit, A-Plus is the one to get
Foul, if you think I'm flippin on the man with the skills
Niggas get the dills, still
Hieroglyphics sound the lights, surround the mics
I pound the lights cuz they haven't found the light
But I never taught ya discipline, feel my fist again
If it's in your face, get a taste, cuz you commit the sin

MC's should know their limitations, their limitations
MC's should know their limitations
MC's should know their limitations, their limitations
MC's should know their limitations

When Captain Tajai throws his mighty mic
All the dirt I urge I splurge I fly nerds while I be fine
Put on your radar, I don't stay far
That's why men are noid, I irritate like hemmaroids
 (ouch)
You made the proper preperations, I still ate ya
I hate ya, I rate the
Mindstate of niggas that I'm greater, none of that later
We can do this I wreck blocks like Brutus
It's not a chore ta, make you come up shorter
Cuz niggas know I'm sure to serve without takin no orders
So here's a tip from the hip to your dips
Get with the man who rips, stop being stalled by them drips
I'll do you swell, 
I got better aim than Willy Tell
I rung so let me ring your bell
DING-DONG! My sing song swells like a Samolian
Stuck in my pocket, I simply rock it

Call it splat on your face when you try to face the match
You're tripping you're slipping you're sliding off my fly blend
Of wording, soon to be hurting, a nerd teen rabbit
Peace to the niggas who got my back and
Everyone else can get the dills
I hit your skills up, like my tag
You rag and boast about your coast but it really don't phase me
You're style's lazy, you must be drinkin that Crazy
My thinking's phat and it pays me!
Your days be decreasing be-cause we beats men
I seen at least ten enemies daily!
But what you'll get bold, and try to play me maybe that
Imbecile, while my bat, is sensible
His brain I got ta beez giving niggas lobotimes
I trife with these, individuals criminals of my own rap
On behalf of Phesto, I like to laugh


Yeah, now I got something to say, on the behalf of Hieroglyphics
This the D-E-L, and umm, I'm sick of all you weak-ass
Booty-ass motherfucking rappers
And uhh, next time I see you on the motherfucking street
I'mma bust your motherfucking nose

I flipped the script like a dyslexic actor
You're no factor
I got the type of skills that make you wanna quit
I might be ill and my mic it steals that old beyonder shit
I palm this shit, what's seen next is keen text
Be-ing ex-pelled from my diaphragm
I'm flyer, damn, would you 
grok
 it can't you receive it
I bust like cleavage, rock shit, then I leave it
In shambles, cuz I can like Campbell's
A sample of Tajai, is much more than ample

Yo, who the hell are you? You're not me
I got me and three brothers that are cocky
To rock the, masses, whippin niggas asses
At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, cause it makes me think of more shit to kick
Leave me alone, back the hell up hobbes
I never thought my son would ever try to beat up pops
I got a leather strap, for the fella that
Wanna tell the mack lies, I send em back with black eyes

I ain't trippin, what I'm flipping's on the contrary
To your weakness, retreat if you wanna restrain
From being beat, I freak lifting syllables
So kill the bullcrap, I'm arousing dousing drowning
When my sound swings, I found things
To bequeath, you're beneath, you need relief, to be brief
I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
Cuz I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill the noise,
 my boys, never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay

My stick drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
Satanic messages I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove ya, off a cliff I got the gift to shapeshift
I encourage say nigga suicidal
The shit I write'll, make you clutch a bible
I got the Cali type styles
, I wipe smiles
And smirks off of jerks cuz that weak shit don't never work
Niggas is whack as fuck your over
Get your life together, find some direction cluck nigga

I got G's in my verse who tell me
It hurts a fella when I rip, because I'm sly slick
The nigga fly chicks ride with
I'm leaving niggas stranded man that's how I planned it
Landed blows with my random flows
And it goes -- a little something like this
And I might diss, with my right fist I strike kids like a pitcher do
I split your bitch you better switch or I twist ya
I play tricks like a mix
When booty niggas miss the beat
I figure that they wack I go and get my bat and get a pack of Swisher sweets
Plus be ill when I bust the grill but we chill
Who the fattest? {​Hiero}​ It's batting practice

It's no feat, how I defeat, weaker
Individuals set em up like give and go
A heat seeker, I take a bat and flatten your features
Beseech ya, proving I'll do that too
Cuz when you, pulls my clothes on and shrouded
I'm out with ya grip and you're pimpin so how did he
Do that shit, who dat kid, you're asking the masked man
Who fly higher than 
NASA
Ask friends
 what you need when I need your blockin
Then I leave you knocked in
Counts to call I trounce em all
With the quickness, using fitness, leave you fitless
Who got a problem with me ripping all that I do
I'm betting way more than you
Hey sure you knew my rhymes was fly
My lines imply that I'm fatter, next batter

I got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat y'all
It's like this y'all, it's like that y'all

Get the fuck out, I never struck out
Better get the bucks out, and kick em down
Wrecking, extreme havoc when I'm practising
That could mean a loss of conciousness when I launches this
Back to the scene of the crime I'm never on sight
Untouchable, what you pulled another heist?
Precisely, I's be the man that did it
Said it, free up your posession never regretted
No anaesthetic so you're headed for some suffering
Bufferin can't ease the aches and pains of 
migraines
When I trail this drain
 on your lifestyle
Pull a knife while, you give it up, simp
I'm a pimp got your ho and got your dough
And got the best flow in the universe, snatchin titles
Like a purse, niggas be the spot in a hearse
I'm worse, than the baddest, it's batting practice

It's Phesto so keep your cash flow, 
Hey Presto
It's gone, right before your eyes, if you're wise
Another heist done nice when I slice
Your neck and snatch ya duffel bag with a sag
And I'm gagging your grill, dag I get ill
Dangerous if it's your brain I bust then take your
Chains and stuff, with the victimising, surprising
And I'm quick to size men, up with a swing to your grill
What I planned difficult that's split your skull
With a tool, if you ever fool, with the Souls
Did you ever think, if you blinked
I wouldn't get you for your links, and your cash and your minks
Savage enough to keep my average up
Puttin chumps in 
assume a new marking
 then I'm scotch free
Watch me, duck into the night with your valuables
I'm getting down with my tools

 Man, I understand
 And
 I got a plan for improvement...

But you gets the finger
And I bring a, attitude with me
Cause brothers that I know be acting shifty
Let me be me, and I'll let you be you
But why talk about me if it's not me that you're talkin to
Let's make it clear, you do not know, me
So skip 'How ya livin', 'How ya feel, bro G'
To me that's phony; asking if my shit's dropping
The kids stop when, they start to get they lips popped, and
They say I forgot 'em, but I ain't seen 'em in four years
 You always had my number
 So step with your poor tears
 And what about Blessings?
 Plus is my man!
 You need to stop it
Screw the doers, of rumors
Cause you nerds never profit

Tell me who profits? You got beat, cause you like to gossip

In school I never used to raise my hand in class
I always knew the teacher's hand
A passing grade to me - in the back, relax
Cause they wasn't kickin facts
In facts, I never learned math

I can fool with the school system
They take facts and twist 'em
Into knots, right up the blocks
A spot, to get a 40
Around the corner get cracks

Perhaps these is traps, to keep us tapped
Saps, can buy gats, with flat-tipped bullet caps
In the locker room with no hassle
And assholes sell cracks in sacks
To class-foes & friends
Cause the mass goes with the trend

My friend, the niggas makin ends is livin illegal
That's the way to get, fat, and then we will
Get stacks of cash, forget class, yeah
That's the way to go, I'm out to get dough

Dough? The education, to get you further
Than murder and drugs with thugs
You're better off being a nerd

That's absurd!
Life don't mean nuthin' without fat pockets
That's the only way to get paid
You tell me who profits

""O&P: Tell me who profits?
O: I'll have G's
P: But you'll get shot, kid (dick)!""

Huh! Ya gotta wonder, why niggas plunder, kill
Have ya torn asunder
Cuz I'mma build
And fill
A glass pipe full of crack
And black men's pockets be phat
A little
Lets whittle the way to the core now
Ya packin' a Glock
Mackin' the block
Fight with the cops
Well, who ya takin' the risk for?
A kingpin swingin'
With the president
Greasin' 'em up & givin' 'em papes
For drugs in the States
Have ya dodgin' niggas and caps
He's with George & Clarence
Digging golf balls out of sand traps
He's never seen Frisco or Oakland
He got a glimpse of New York
When he went to see the opera (""ahhhhhh!"")
He's seventy-six, getting senile
If we live past 2-4 we're due for a stay in the penile
So see now, we polish our Berettas
But there's no boats or caine fields nowhere in the ghetto

The future is a fiction, there is only now!
A brief intermission, there is only now!
Of this there is no question, there is only now!
And if I get too lifted, would you hold me down?
And if you think I'm slipping, would you show me how?
The future is a fiction, there is only now!

Check it!
It was the kind of love Most people only find it once
Divinely touched by angels; There was no time for lust
Plus some'll tell that a teenage love Will never last
Looking through the glass of past scars
Fast forward to the future
Where the youth Them are a-changing
But this couple don't care what you saying
They're hearts blazing
Can't nobody tell 'em nothing
Their love is unstoppable
Overcome any obstacle
Together they will always grow
(Don't let go, I'm holding on)
He know they saying take it slow To him it's taking long
(Safest place is in your arms)
Her daddy saying this ain't right; To her it can't be wrong
(Baby, if we hold on a little while longer cause the love is so strong
You know that I would die If you left me)
I pray this feeling never leaves me, I want it forever
And I'll do anything To see that we always together
Whatever; It takes for something that no one can sever
Together, forever, whatever
It takes for something that no one can sever
And I'll do anything To see that we always together
Forever, together
Together, forever

What's love? Can you imagine being told, by the old
This ain't right, fuss and fight
Don't you roll, it's so cold
What's your mold, will he break Or will he fold?
They on him, they want him; The homie Stoney
In love with his girl and so is his big homie
Now what a pity; A footnote to the cutthroat, it's rare
See, I was told all in love is unfair
One fee, one fare, done there
Fishing, dishing, and wishing upon air
Vision beyond years
Damn, people always pushing the wrong way
See my advice to the homie Stoney
Is do it your own way, the long way
And hear what the song say
Together, forever, forever, together, you dig?
See, this what it's supposed to boast
And get close and be with the one that you truly love the most
It's destiny
The past is an illusion, there is only now

They already move Planets and moons
The plan is to vanish and move
Flip a townhouse down south Pow wows with the gals
Out bound fishing boat Where the city folks sip and smoke
Then these folks pushing the envelope
Which extended hope To a inner-most impulse
His desire for a child undisclosed
Deep inside a fire took hold
The moment that the plot was shown
Visions of intermingled souls
Matching afros, juleps on a creaky porch
Life at a slower tempo
No regulations to encroach upon their relations Cantankerous kinfolks, damn
If they can't accept us then we gonna scram
(Can't hide the way that I'm feeling for you
My emotions can't be concealed -I was in love
And together you and I will show the world -I wanted him to be the only one
Our love is for real -I was in love)

The past is an illusion, there is only now, now
A brief intermission, there is only now
Of this there is no question, there is only now
And if I get too lifted, would you hold me down?
And if you think I'm slipping, would you show me how?
The future is a fiction, there is only now
The past is an illusion, there is only now, now",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-there-is-only-now-lyrics

Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me
 
postal
(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)
She say she love me then she go through
Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news
Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you
When you act crazy it be making me postal
Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you

First she love me, then she don't, then she love me
First she wanted a hug, now she wanna club me
First thing I said was, hey baby you looking lovely
You shrug your shoulders and tell me you feeling ugly
Give another compliment then you mean mug me
I even dressed up rocking the clean rugby
Baby, I'm just a man doing what I can
It should mean something, I'm seeing you and none of them
You know I'm the shit, so you don't fool with other men
And I'd still be with you even if you were not a ten
You getting one of the moods, and threw me out again
And the way that you talking its like you truly not a friend
My lifestyle is making you doubt what I'm about
I've been through this before it ain't hard to figure out
And when I'm on the verge of leaving
You get to thinking
The next thing you know we laying in the bed sleeping
She like you so loco
When you go postal
Yeah you like that, you like that, don't you

I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal

Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news
(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)

Using sex as a weapon should never be part of the plan
Jealous the introspection probably help you with that
But in fact
You'd rather be on the attack
Yelling and screaming in public, girl you know the math
It never adds up
All it does is just subtract
Until you hit that brick wall and there ain't no coming back
Get up
Telling me first
Man she was so thirsty
But now as I was giving she was hallowing mercy
But now she ultra confrontational in the worst way
Fucking up my summertime and crashing my birthday
With a hurricane, I heard saying the same old thing
I'm always in the eye of the storm
You know the game
Is played out
I stay out
And drankst out so I don't think about it
Cause she make me feel like America's most hounded
You think I wanna stick around in mushroom cloud shit
A nuclear fallout when she pop up and shouted
And I was just defending myself
You know how I do
And even when I blew my lid, I kept it so true

I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal
(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)
She say she love me then she go through
Emotional places where I can't go to
Next morning your normal acting like it's old news
(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)
When you act crazy it be making me postal
(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that, don't you)

Dam, You got some nerve miss
I'm thinking to myself, do I deserve this
I mean, I'm trying to be there with you
But honestly, I'm lightweight scared of you
I just can't see myself without you
Same time, I can't be myself around you
Understand I'm a work in progress
All this fussing will just hurt the process
Still I feel like you complete me
I'm such a weakling man look how you treat me
I know that love ain't suppose to hurt
Even brought you around my seed you got close to her
Turn around and use that against me
When you flash you do it with such intensity
Say anything to offend me
I ain't gonna tell you what my family and friends think
Skip it baby, Cause this is our thing
Why you gotta make loving me such a hard thing

I play my part just like I'm supposed to
Now, you wanna tell me that I don't show you
When you act crazy it be making me postal
(Ya like that, ya like that, ya like that don't you)

And I'll give ya
Much more than you need yo fly nigga
Scorin' the weed sticky green'll make me high quicker
Twistin' it and mixin' it with Bacardi lime liquor
Beligerent kickin' it with (tati on?) the time ticker
You could be a dyin' man with a mic but I'm sicker
You rhyme wack as I bust like Leon Isaac
Makin' peons slide back
That don't be on the right track, we way off
So now they stay soft like impotence
But I say naw, I'd rather stay raw
Magnificent rippin' it
Givin' it all I can though
Plus I handle devious scandals
MISCHIEVOUS COMMANDO!!
Luchini like Camp Lo
Wreckin' the beats
Gettin embassy's executive cheese

I'm the loose cannon aid on deck
Detonate in a millisec
Covered in a blackened silloutte
And still reflects enough light
To shatter your body like a pinyata
Boba Fett or
Jim Cata doin' lyrical kapoeta
The net to netta
Smokin' purple fibers off the hedges
Till it's resin
And pledge allegiance
To the essence
Confront Phes rock
Ever present with hesitance
My tongue twistin' tornadoes
Never miss your residence
You cackling cacophonies
Me and the mike is holy matrimony
Tackling your phony flow matrix
You couldn't absorb or deflect the impact
With roll cages
The soul aces
Take you to that oasis


We meditate to educate
Make my mind luminous
Avoid the tricky and the ruth-eless
Movin' swift
The juggernaut force
We maneuver this rap game
What the bumboclat
Woman act strange
And get tipsy off the fat chain
Nigga splurgin' at the bar and thinkin' that's game
Till they get you for your Chevy
Beamer/Ac/Range
If you lack
Lack brains
The facts
The facts change

Latch onto my concept
In the context of conquest
I capture, your conscience
Move upon you with logic
But it's so deep up in ya
Ain't no way you fittin' to dislodge that
I mean way up in ya
Bend your mind like a fender
How the (bought?) of my new agenda
My deluge of lewd yet shrewd mental food will wet you
And your crew
So eschew from testin' my standard issue
Let alone the cannons and missles for heavy damage aimed at those
Grandstanding with petty anti-antics
Can't match those, handcrafted by my many mechanics
Who's skills run the gamut who will run the planet
Any time I exert my will it's outstandin'
To the point where you gotta hand it or hate and be mad
It don't matter to me
Over a bed of fresh beats its style au natural with no additives

Even if you brandishing guns and break laws
I make you let the pistol go and praise God
A dynamo
Shinin' on the mike like a quasar
They can't infiltrate the steel cage brain star
I'm feelin' blood hounds all on my trail
Like my lyrics was peruvian candy
Not a fugitive
Truly expanding minds with rhymes with the family
Who be gettin' higher than the Andes
The way I plant seeds deep in the underground
Make the thunderous pound to get your heart pumpin'
Spark up the kryptonite
People gettin' lit tonite
Indica-like, to try to simplify try

Shootin stars burn burning up in flames
Shootin stars burning up in flames
Shootin stars burn burning up in flames
It's always gotta be a knuckle head startin controversy
Puttin on his makeup to take flicks for the Enquirer
While we entrepreneur these fools startin fire works
Causin scandals and music gimmicks
That's why they're jerks
No originality, no classic material
I be hearin flows sounding so much like the Souls its delirium
But I sit back, don't interfere with them
Stay focused, it's inner energized like a pyramid
We come out while they disappear right quick
In blaze of Hierotechnicalities so exquisite
The Souls of Mischief crew came torpedoing through
Left a crater in the desert with a four mile radius
Others, they just be part of the meteor shower
Heated up for a minute then dissolve in a towering inferno
Every evening you can see them
In the black of the night, spectacular sparks of light
Man I'm seein hella shootin stars like astronomers
While I'm attackin mic I watch them all cremate
The searing heat breaks the fake rapper to molecules
Now all these fools get dynamited
They can't move of breathe
Sounding like eternally extinguished
Didn't learn their fiendish ways
Makes 'em delicate
Fragile like stained glass
I put it down so eloquent
Platinum sellin shit still sports ya but we ever lasting

Shooting stars
Burning up in a flames when they hit the Souls of Mischief atmosphere
Chasing fame
See, they came and went in a millisecond
If you didn't catch 'em, man
They one in the same
It's so mundane
They start off really flashy
But soon then they get axed with the Apache Tomahawk
Slammed to the mat
Superfly stuck a nukka for trying to rap like that
Hook up the microphone from we can scrap
We fit with the muzzle your mind sizzles and bubbles
Uh oh, it's trouble
You get smothered trying to penetrate the ozone layer
Player, you're just another flare in the dark
Fired up like the dragon's lair
You get slayed, you're not the slayer
Dissolving into thin air
Nowhere to be found cause we impair
Taken as rappers who dare to compare
Selling like a share on the Pacific Exchange
But we rip it the same
It's all prepared to slang the pangs through your earphones
You walk on tight ropes trying to engage the fearsome
Unbalanced advancements lead to your last dance with death
Can I hear something
Cause we know he wasn't saying nothing when we steamed 'em up administration by veto
He was like, ""That was freestyle? You're my hero""
The mic was on him, and he got shaky and pale
Taking 'bout, ""Man, I can't come off the top""
Cause we prevail over the dope fiend scanner brain antics
Mechanic and robotic like a sentinel
Man, we unconventional
We coming so immaculate
Taking niggas dap and shit
You couldn't panic these with a gat and a clip
So stay in the pinch you losers
You ain't equipped
Astral projecting poetics
Quicksilver fast to split your ass to smithereens
You wear the ring, the rig of explosions engulfing your whole scene

He's a shooting star
Burning up in a flames when he hit the Souls of Mischief atmosphere

A Chevy Silverado or a similar make
Several shots fired
Consider the passengers armed and dangerous
Do not approach
Contact the authorities immediately

Funny how these niggas think that they nicer than me
Cause they sit in a cypher spitting they life away
Like they hyper at me
But I don't give a fuck bout none of them niggas cause I'm trifling, see?
As I come back
They reminded you to how you was thinking they better
Well fuck it, I'mma show them who better
And get this berreta, the dilemma is I ain't having that shit
You better step back bitch

Black ratchet, black mask, pulled up in the black van
Jumped out of the black van
Ran upon them ready to give him the backhand
Ayo who that nigga? Domino
Sorry nigga he gotta go

And niggas is jumping, you hear vehicles
Screeching, you can hear their hearts beating
Why did George Bush, Sr. see ya

Who the fuck is better than who now?
You niggas still wanna battle? I show you how I battle

Shots fly that showoff shit y'all was doing fly out the window
But now I'm gunnin' through, where the fuck you niggas runnin' to?

Bullets for Phesto, leak like Aquafina trash nigga
The shots'll swell you bigger than Katina ass nigga
Got a couple left for Opio and A-Plus
Watch how the gauge bust

Hey Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Ass nigga, back the act quicker and then I spit them at you
Casual, see actually I'll throw a kitchen at you

It's Womack bitch, hold that bitch
Hairl long, see if it finna grow back bitch

Fresh as shit, sparing no expense, like a pharaoh or a prince

We paying no attention to them sore thumbs

Summertime crop tops, goodies 'bout to pop out
Tryna seal the deal passing a doobie

At a black duly packed full of hoolies, who these niggas man?

They rolled past and backed up
They jumped out the black truck
With black mask and black gat
We froze up and that fast

Okay, I'm panicked, we ransomed back to the car that we was sitting on
I see my homie shaking on the ground, I think my nigga gone
Heard some more shots in the distance I'm looking for an exit
Two girls I saw up in the club rode up and told me get in

I heard the muffler and now I'm running for some cover
Some suckers put they ride in reverse and burned rubber
Got me flustered on my old brother, there goes the summer
Cancelled supper, but I tuck jumped behind a garbage dumpster

Blood is bucking out of the snub nose, I ducked over
Underneath the front of the Nova like what the fuck yo
And caught another glimpse of the villain as he was once mo'
Tryna catch a victim who slipping and make the blood flow

Hit the corner, tucked the asphalt, barely touched my toes
Nigga tryna shoot my ass off, heard a couple mo'
Then the car  block and the shots stopped

Tell 'em fold, I'm workin with a straight flush

What's your name?
You look fantastic

Was it the fame? (Nah)

No drastic measures, just for pleasure, laughs, kicks
Conversation was simple, she liked my dimples
Asked me when will I be leavin town, it's goin down
I said tomorrow, a look of sorrow crossed her face
But I'm a ace, skate 'em, shot 'em to the hotel for the satin lace
Treatments, Victoria's Secrets
Get me weak in the knees, baby please don't tease me
She put the squeeze on me, had me whipped

I couldn't handle it, shot 'em out but now I want 'em back
Baby doll, tell me where the fuck you at?

And make the Johnson vibrate like a tonsil
Plus on the tonsils honey boom be on the job

I want a bitch that's mangy

Cause if you shot at him 80 niggas will be on yo block cappin
He had family, understand me
And he know po-po, no, he make his dough sellin candy
He got friends in high places
Right in 'em skyscrapers
I bet they help him beat his five cases
Untouched, a true mack indeed
He pull a Mac, you bleed
He made his stack from crack and weed
He fucked up, the fact is
The nigga tried to duck taxes
Now he at that argument you punks static
Federal pen with non-hetero men
Climbin you front to back
Aw, nigga where the fuck you at?

I like them wide hips to slide in
After the shows we rocked with ease, I'm captivatin
Hoes are waxin and they attractin
I see that lookin at mine's with fascination
Mesmerized so I'm bookin them thighs for a visit later
She replied yes to see her undressed
I just couldn't deny that she possessed the most voluptuous
Ass and D cups, it was almost too much for just me
I said, 'What's up with us?'
We got in the cut and let the lust erupt
Scandalous and she did me justice with them luscious lips
Givin a nigga rushes with the slightest touches, but bust this
Now I gotta live with the repercussions, corruption
She raised up when I dazed under the assumption
She could be trusted, now I'm like what's this
Flustered left for broke I'll cuss this
Ho I'll probably never see again, had a motive and
Got me for my dough, so all I really wanna know is bitch...

 storming the beach, gallantly in army fatigues
Breach  the speech
Probably kamikaze the beat, probably unique
Out of your reach, Muhammad Ali
 higly intrigued
That malarkey they speak is sloppy next to 
The apartment chief, don't call me when I'm popping at freaks
Starving ass geeks, at Mardi Gras you fall in the streets
Stop with the drinks, to cops you a fake
So you swear that you a criminal, but talk to police, you thief

You saying you the owner when you dropping the lease
And he saying he original but copy your beats
Save me the typical you're not in my league
Claiming you Olympian, never got on the team
Stop playing with them chemicals, they rot in your brain
All you got is your word, telling lies so absurd
Like it's not a concern, that's when drama occurs
All you got is your word, even with dollars to burn
Everybody'll learn, all you got is your word

I've done seen it, lowest valley, highest zenith
Life fly by speeding, pen bleeding
Composing a flow that's undefeated, when moments ago
I was a fetus, now notice me grow to a fucking genius
Wimpy flows, never keep me on my tippy toes
More feminine than any woman I've been with before
Rappers be shallow, hollow, frontin’ for real deep
My word's the only thing I can give and still keep
I built on the hill with Khalil Gibran
And I chill with the killers, where my skills was born
Oakland, California, here the mental is strong
In the middle of the storm, but I'm here to live on and on
Keep you lit up like the 
Comb with a bomb in the pineal gland they talk silicone
 when it's Venice Dawn to dusk
On a skunk while they flunk looking thunderstruck, uh

And they saying you the owner when you dropping the lease
And he saying he original but copy your beats
Save me the typical you're not in my league
Claiming you Olympian, never got on the team
Stop playing with them chemicals, they rot in your brain
All you got is your word, telling lies so absurd
Like it's not a concern, but that's when drama occurs

Souls of Mischief,Hiero Oldies Vol. 1 ,2003,"(Busta Rhymes: “Always misbehaving and mischievous”)

Kaboom! The Jedi’s back to seismic
Shock ya, I’m the doctor
With the donor organ I amputated from your body, shotty
I got equipped with slingshots to fling rocks and clean clocks
I’m leaving emcees in comas, traumatized
In conniptions when I flips my scionic powers
It’s been hours, since you cowards
Got devoured, when I showered these
Catastrophic flows, I’m overwhelming foes
‘Cause Phesto’s rhetoric’s the sedative bestowed
Upon ya, misdemeaning the schemes when I shift your blisters
(Busta Rhymes: “Always misbehaving and mischievous”)

Yo, now I gotta kill a nigga quicker than AIDS virus
Will a hoe try the flyest? ‘Cause I just
Know that fools will never know the half and then I laugh
‘Cause I never sweat none of them niggas from Telegraph
And I never ever front, but I pull a clever stunt
And I do it better so I bet it’s what you want
Give me the props and while you’re at it, get off the penises
Of the Keener kids, you seen I did
Destruction, what’s in store, skins for me
‘Cause I am the man and you can only pretend to be
A-P-L, you know the rest is history
X is finsta be flexin’ instantly
Since it be my turn, I burn like VD
Venereal Disease and I bury all emcees
Souls of Mischief, my bros hoes can get with
I suppose that a foe knows who is gifted

(Busta Rhymes: “Always misbehaving and mischievous”)

I’m sly, swift like a stiff spring breeze
Swing schemes of a nature that is mischievous
My soul is into this, render this
Mic property, properly
Or I’ll pop ya, G, see I got to be
Incarcerated, hated by the boys in blue, poison you
Pose a threat, if you wanna step then I can voice a few
Verses, curses never catch me ‘cause I’m crafty
Nasty like your bitch getting rich on the ave, see
I’m a vandal and I think the vast majority that bore of me
I’m well-endowed, shroud the head with a beanie
Now I’m feeling camouflaged, my bat is lodged in your ribcage, meany
Miney mo, find me, Joe could cross me on the PM
Creepin’, crack the cranium when I see him
‘Cause Opio gets even Stevens, tis the season
For swinging bats and taxin’, breaking backs and
Smacking all the suckers ‘cause I’m thieving
(A-Plus: Ayo, who’s it on?)

Tajai ‘cause I’m flyer than invites
And when mics are gripped, dips flip
The bat will then hit with the stiff one
Gets funds for freakin’ words and herds of huns
Now chumps, um, fight ‘cause I hit more skins than sunlight
So one plight is equal to the flight
Heads, bob or crack as Louisviller flies opponents
And frauds get jelly or come crummy like the donuts
Chewy, many have said when I envelop folks
I can come flyer than sex on Hubble telescopes
Hella folks are heathen, there’s no reason for existence
Persistence to drive then you die; why bother
I shoos off foes like Japanese restaurants
The best ain’t gots to practice, I bat kids and adults
Ask folks why, because I’m leavin’
Ayo fuck this shit, man, I’m out…

I'm sharper than Clive Barker or Steven King when I'm authoring evil things
I'll smoke you like a Marlboro, but I'm a cheeba fiend, puffin white zombie
That make people dream of cities of gold
Around the world twice before I was 20 years old
Fuckin' slutty-ass hoes, and top-notch babes spending money uh-oh
Offerin' to buy me some coke
Listen baby I'm a lyricist, that's not my thing
I slang dope, but not pharmaceuticals super flow
Yeah numero uno cuz you know
The human cat scan wouldn't read your brain, they say ""He's insane!""
Listen to my raps man
Colder than zero, I’ll freeze the rain, hail mary
We remain, don't care if we front page on the rolling stones
It’s in my chromosomes to hold my own, rock till I'm overthrown
I'm jack hammering, raps of stone
Walls and I won't fall
Victim, drunk like I'm awesome, incredible, federal
Like forty watter(?), hotter than an orgy, spot a corny nigga from a mile away
Yeah, Eastside Oakland, raised me that way, 
I got my three eyes open
Get played like a saxophone, fracture bones, knees thighs head
And keep firing when I hear sirens

Mind your own, try to find your own, before your
Time is gone, see we all dying' alone
I'll never be the one to cry if you don't
But who the fuck am I to imply what you decide is wrong
Give a fuck about what you side you on
Or you going to kill
Niggas keepin' it real don't pay none of my bills
Still I keep at it to feed my weed habit
No seeds, its sticky green, please, I don't need acid

""We be developed in this rap shit""
""Souls of Mischief""
""You got to understand""

I'm chocolate thunder on the track board
Throwing heat like Goose Gossage, sidearm
Like a firearm on a hostage
Ready for combat, it's contact sport with gat forced hiphonics
They high drama like Trump and Ivana
I'm art, 2600 sharp and nimble
Transmission double clutch I'll double dust the symbol
Pimp diffusion, monophonics many moogen
Skate to Cardinal(?) like glaze on Olympic luges
Fluctuate my deluxe delusions, a state of flux maneuver
I'm armor-all on vinyl, ya'll vaginal
In a candlelight vigil when vital signs are final
Flat line your spinal, throw rhymes and tight spirals
Hammer up through the head winds with Evidence, Babu and ira science, hire a sniper
I still dodge the bullets while I windmill the viper, high performance
And use your face as a windshield wipers
Have you wearing six inch heels and a diaper bitch
Now you get banged for your buck not bang the switch

This here we taking shit, and they ain't taking shit
And if you take this shit, rework it and remake it we gon' break your shit
I said it, minutes set it, any man in my dominion
Demeaning the inner tenant entertainers, my tenants remain true
You do you, as far as I'm concerned this is all mine and ya'll my tenants
This rhyming of polemical proportion
Scorching the mundane claims of you pedestrian thespians
Histrionics, Ebonics lace tales of crimes and chronic in the myriad ways you chase tail
The mirror's amazed at what it sees
MCs empty reflections and soul projection
I use the message as my soul's protection

Stop hatin' before my dogs mash on ya
Niggas claimin' they ballers they can't even sack dosia
No model chicks, just a trick, some wack (bova?)

Snatch your weak broad then we playin' leapfrog

Yeah we sometimes explicit
Never complicit, bust it
I gets busy usin' the arts of mystics
Break the shit down then I start to twist it
Blow it, into the wind

No need to counteract you counter-attack us you're kinda wack
Engaged in static with the lymphatic pimp at it
Large and the thought you was still swift at it rhythmatic
With hard shit
Wordsmith versatile while Jewel of the Nile style

You scary-ass low-class ho-ass nigga
Broke-ass nigga you don't know cash, nigga

Aw yeah
I'm like side street high speedin'
Sharp turnin'
Rack and pinion steering veerin' towards the curb &
Police runnin', machine-gunnin'
Gasoline Mark Fuhrman, start burnin', leave nothin'
No evidence just dead presidents
The Fed's nemesis treacherous evil residents
Who got weapons with scopes on 'em Op' squash it
They deep as the exorcist tryin' to cause a closed coffin
Man I'm on a mic show stoppin'
Like a loaned shotgun
The rest are so monotonous
Pseudo-scientific but you know Hiero's infinite
Fuck a diamond I dominate concentrate

Sword blaze your vertebaes up
Swing my laser like a space-age sensei

Backfire on the Messiah

Rapid fire through your rap attire

Dazzled 'em with fabulous force that's haphazardous
Third-rail ya taggers with flow, hell daggers

Say what? Never under pressure, stress-free
We shock the mic, you don't impress me
I live the life of a MC, no pretending
Souls of Mischief rock the house
So baby spread your wings now, and let me come on in
Show you right from wrong, you wanna do it again
Release all that pent up aggression
Come caress and massage my dick
Baby, it's not a marauder stick
Damn right Hieroglyphics for life
Close-knit, while these others crews fight we write hits
As far as settling discrepancies
With other MC's, it's a breeze
Cause I stay focused while they frustrated; ease
Off the mic; don't cause a ruckus
It's destructive, unproductive
See, us we keep in touch with the ones that bite
Yeah, some write to diss, but it's a mismatch
I guess I attract the wack, backstage
We wage battles and leave unscathe

It's Phesto in stereo
Souls of Mischief don't stop, don't quit
To everybody in the O, Hiero-
Glyphics rollers imperially equipped to eclipse
And overshadow the best with no stress, just
The mic concealed
With my limits boundless, countless
Plus my prowess ( ? )
For the female funk who wanna get into some Mischief
Submissive like I got 'em drunk
And I got 'em junked
With they knees hyperextendin, weakened
Speakin in tongues like a ventriloquist
Until I quit
While these niggas oversaturated with exaggerated nonsense
I don't respond, simps
They just pawns beyond dense
Infatuated with they lyrics never correspondent
I guess it never dawned on 'em
They don't belong on the
Mic like germs
I like to watch 'em squirm
Convincin me they styles anything more then elementary
But spermicidal is the title they've earned

I'm comin from the land of dope
Where all of these niggas never plan to hope
You could either be the man or no
But my plan was writin hella raw
Standard quite cause I be the man you like
To hand a mic
So I can make a dollar, and make ya holler
I never fake a scholar
Dumpin rappers in a lake of water
I proceed to max
Be pagin Leed if I need the sacks
Hit the weed, relax
In the O we knowin where you're at
Be in the cut if you scared of them gats
Cause Oakland niggas be prepared to jack

I make my mail so I won't have to run that broke skid
(Ya don't stop)
Some niggas serve rocks at spots
And get shot over knots to clock
But yo I rock the spot
Hah... (Ya don't quit) with that soul shit
I smoke a quarter, then flow swift

Now fuck that Quaalude, I'm talkin half sips to the head
Let's have a meeting of the minds, nobody's leavin till we all red
Went to the jam, we caravaned to see an excitin sight to see
The music inside invitin me
To rip the mic if need be
But you know it's important that I pull
The women with the jewels glistenin, whoo
Only I can get the fly sisters' rumps to switch up
With a swisher sittin on trump
Cop the spark as I... you niggas step in haphazard
To the stage up center
T to the a's up in the zone solo
Bitch niggas should've thrown bolos
But you missed 'em
Now even your misses listen
I feel them jealous stares stuck at my back
But don't drop the microphone until I feel I fully did that
Damn, who these kids that come to every single show
And always wanna pull they Roscoes instead of hoes
You better grow up, I'm with niggas you don't know I'm with
So just stall out with all that dumb shit

Haven't seen a thing like this in all your life
Cause he's the ghetto super- Fate is on his side
Moving like a shadow in the dark of night

Been looking for new Dinero to get me some cool apparel
Through the narrow streets and perilous metropolis city blocks

Every minute time is tickin'
Drop a dime, shine the signal
See my barehanded grapple any midget foe
With a kingpin fetish perish

Better let the ghetto superhero handle his business

Why they would lie to me or leave abandoned
Damn it - in the land of the free, we scramble to eat
If you can't compete you harm your family tree
But sitting in a cell you could be sitting in hell
Parallel universe, the world in which I dwell
It's the mastery of fear not the absence of fear
Courage in the words you hear, I spit some truth in your ear

Envision in metal rise in my extremities
The fibrillating shock I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies
Hyper ventilating my body chemistry faded
We waited for Tajai but did he get eliminated?

I hate it, I circled the block, my brain is working the pot
I can't say for certain or not if Tajai is hurting from shots

Thought you swarming they was serving that scotch
We observing the clock
And every person that walked by is a person that watched

All I heard was a pop, nervous system slipping to shock
Body twisted and quickly got acquainted with the black top
Blacked out, then my universe became white
Whiteness, I'm surrounded by a bunch of black dots
Now quicker than a nigga could get graced to be alive
Four hitters hit my wiggum with them Gregory Hines
Tryna roly poly, they dropping builders on me
Somebody came with that swift kick that left ya homie snoring


Uh, I can't face the fact I don't know where my aces at
And I ain't okay with that
I'm thinking who did it and where they staying at to pay them back
Why was they placing at, a swim we was laying back
Them boys wasn't playing jack, what you say to that?

Let me state the facts, Massey missing in action
And all we know is the disappearing niggas was blasting
If he isn't here in a minute and there's no witness to admit the assassin caught him slipping
We looking for that liquid plasma

Woke up in the black truck they must've put in the back of
Garage door opened and they backed up
Something went like they got a bunch of jackals in cages
Dropped me on the table like a fucking sack of potatoes
Sudden attack from what looked like a rabid lab
Turned my calf to a bloody mess and tattered rags
They duct taped my face as we entered the place

In the stomach the way I bust from the gut & get
G's by the hundred but
That don't matter (fool)
Cause niggas get millions

Absolutely, I be rapping smoothly
If she acting too keyed

Freeze rappers like a tractor beam

Running busters for their presidentials

Physical enslaved to my imbalanced mental
My confidence is not confidential
So show deference for my skills differential

But I ain't really trippin, I ain't, you know...
Man

I started writin rhymes in 1982, I was 8
My older brother used to let me hear his Too $hort tapes (Biatch)
Sugarhill and Spoonie G was with me
'Bout anything I could I get
Was non-stop in my cassette
Or on my phonograph
But in 9-4 I gotta hold my laugh
In, I be cappin
At this wave of overnight rappin
How dare you defy me, you're tiny
Writin your first raps in 1990
You're blindly behind me
I did so many fucked up shows for no cash
Why you wanna diss a player? Cause you slow and I'm fast
Blast fast raps through the mass
To surpass, movin ass
Why diss a nigga cause he makin his cash?

Do it like that
Since I was fresh off the tit my tact
For wordplay unmatched
Rappin nerd straight from back
In the present pressin
Only irreverent, just hatched
Fledgling sack-peddlin
Give me some tracks pal, I rap now
Section of the population
Plus the ones on the idiot box
Showin it pays to be a buster, tittes and cocks
Expose we all some hoes or hustlers
Glocks ammo, no love for any other motherfucker
Is that real or fiction?
Made for TV reels, depictions
Of the life you're wishin
To lead or led before you grab the mic
Hieroglyphics like 3 to your head
Ignite to all
You best to pray you stay raw

You wanna be (Fresh) (Dope)
Tryina be (Fresh) (Dope)
Never be (Fresh) (Do-do-dope)
Never gon' be

Rockin shows, avoidin the gold diggers
Had it all planned out
On a collision course to fail, no doubt

Them niggas ain't makin no mail
Now it's about pounds and peace signs
Since we got a contract
We track through that bullshit
Adapted to rap and act
Sacrificial MC's believe
Souls of Mischief strap 'em down to receive
They blessin
Through the chest and out the back
Like that, then slide with your title intact
Hieroglyphics caused a chain reaction back then
Y'all niggas wasn't rhymin but now it's the trend

So just blend
With the mask galvanized
But my style disguise you pseudo MC's
Plastic over mastic bitin
Molding yo tongues
While amongst the Soul searchers sarcastic
When you was askin was we cashin
In on all this rappin, inquirin
You wasn't aspirin to bein nothin
Now desirin, opposition co-conspirin
Switched to hip-hop, yeah
It's funny mo' niggas know me better than ever
More niggas see me actin like they don't know me than ever
I never waste my time

Trilogy,"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000,"(Opio):
Eighteen willing rednecks sendin me deaththreats
Cuz his niece fantasize about wet sex when I'm in her headsets
She throw caution to the wind
They want to put my third eye in the crosshairs and then
Let rounds off
But see life is a gamble
I stay on my toes like (Ben Vereen?)
And I seen plenty scandals (everyday)
You sound soft when you speakin'
You need ammo to turn Rambo you's a weekend warrior
Oakland California will eat you alive
That shit is weak you can try, you'll get slammed joe
You get your hands broke swingin' on the Man of Steel
You was Blood early this morning now you kryptonite
Mass appeal in the battlefield will have you killed
You get lit up right in front of your buildin'
For tellin' lies to children and sellin' homicide
Come and get some real killers who won't let you walk on by
Or that drama slide
Man get ostracized
Daughter cries cuz her father dies before her eyes
Watch what you talkin' or you might see the same demise
Dangerous times this ain't them kill rhymes
(A-Plus)
Chorus:
We from a place that make you want to leave your gold home
Dangerous like the hole that's up in the ozone
We be smokin' on that killer Cali homegrown
So strong, out of town chicks can't keep their clothes on
(Tajai)
Now we ener-getic kopa-setic never static fully automatic
Very well rounded English boundless
Classic spastic catch and try to grasp it with
Massive missives hit from drastic distance
Graceful swiftness spatially senseless
Music enthusiasts
Danger seekin'
Dramatic dynamic action addict
My rhymes are flame filled expedience game
Real experience
Flashburn MCs with thermal radiation
Feel the ill change the command we aim
To expand these parameters
Phes-Delta, pencil beam ya rap amateurs
Surface to surface, inertial guidance
Throw your pilot
Send 'em all back to the flow asylum
Soul annoyed street sweep the (D E is?) a minefield
For rhyme skill
I travel in shockwaves and spine chills
(A-Plus)
Oakland Cali is a warzone
Evereyday is gettin' harder as it goes on
Souls, stick together like chromosomes
Then we puff a cortisone and get our flows on
In a place that make you want to leave your gold home
Dangerous like the hole that's up in the ozone
We be smokin' on that killer Cali homegrown
So strong, out of town chicks can't keep their clothes on
Yo, yo
I'm already smashin' in a steady fashion
One day I'll get a (fetty?) mansion I'm ready for action
Without any distraction
Chillin' with homies and some women feelin lonely
No one dependin' on me henny sippin' slowly
Through your dough off that buddha smoke
Drinkin' a beautiful
Tell you only if it's for you to know
We arisin' and soon to blow
And the timin' is suitable
But I wonder what these niggas be fightin' and feudin' fo
We do a show
And the price would not fall
And if a fight started off I slice like Darth Maul
No diversion can deter the surgeon operatin'
Exert & (be served?) if you don't stop the hatin'
It's bad business like a virgin copulatin'
Wired up with the coppers waitin'
Without a condom and she ovulatin'
I'm Eddie Haskell
Ready to deal with any asshole
Without any hassle, ha ha
(Opio)
Fuck a backstabbin' snake
Slick, you's a snake
Who tried to penetrate the clique, you sick
I'm serious about this rap shit
We serious about this rap shit
We give a fuck about these hoes that jock
A rolex watch
And give up the twat
For some stones and rocks
If you bulletproof vested & holdin' a Glock
Keep that shit to yourself man you sound like a narc",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-trilogy-lyrics
Batting Practice (Original Version),Hiero Oldies Vol. 1 ,2003,"Move over bacon 'cause the swine is out the picture
Switch the mixture, fix your eyes on the Mister
Twisting necks, fixing bets when I'm cheatin'
Getting many skins 'cause I been down with eatin'
Ever since the clever hits I heard never work
I used a Louisville Slugger for a sucker
Duck a, little bit faster than the last men
That have been up to Astor Ave., and then
Ask him how the Souls of Mischief beat 'em into the soil
I'm cooking up your brain, feel the pain (until it boils...)
Over the pot but you ain't got one to piss in yet
If you got a question, and it's ""Am I dissing?"" Yep
I can energize if you're -ready like Ever was
I'm ready as I ever will be, so chill, G
Will the filthy dirty rotten scoundrel step?
If he does, then we can beat him to the ground and jet
Most say, I'm the nicest person you'll ever meet
Then fools step, but they slept on my clever treat
One handy bat that's made of light steel
Break a bone in two, and they just might heal back
I want to get a little piece like Reese's
But brothers are mad because Ad' is the feces
So A-Plus may just play Willie Mays
And you better get wise until Met really pays

It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I've got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a
It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a

There's a rooster on my shoulder, can I kill it?
How can I maintain pain, blame a pan or skillet
That's swung on the misty streets, all in a night's work
Flights work but you can keep my feet warm too
Ooh, you know _I Gots to Laugh_ like Cas did
Bad kids are blinking like ""Curses! I'm worst!""
Your Spidey-sense may tingle
But my swing filled your head with cobwebs, so wake up, sleeper
Slimly constituted yet I boot it and bruise some
And flights just might get a tad bit gruesome
Who's dumb enough to get stuck with the pitchfork?
Rich give me name-brands and main mans call me Mork
'Cause I've got Mindy, to remove your Fendi
Why call the cops, I sacks them hoes like Ken G
Silhouette's seen, and the next thing's blackness
Attire robbery, or a kick from my Patricks
Hat tricks, with my hockey stick, or a hole in one
With a golf club and the soft love to run
A gun ruins fun like parents, and a hot one
Got one kid like me stepping, 'cause a weapon
Should be club-like, but them thugs like to blast
No sweatin', and Tajai can jet son like Astro
Ask no questions, lessen your cash flow
Fast roll, the task grows greater, later...

It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I've got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a
It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a

Opio is no Pinocchio, I never fib, kid
Dib on your belongings when I'm longing for a new fit
I am quite cunning, never _Running Man_
And I stand with a bat in hand, pants firmly planted in the sand
Step to this, you'll sort of get swung on like a tire swing
Or batted like Babe Ruth, lose a tooth if you try to bring
Anger to the wrangler
You'll get strangled if you tangle with the terrible
Bid farewell to jewelry, the same goes for cash flows
Snatch those, catch those greenbacks
Swing bats to dingbats, I bring bats to knapsacks
Reggie Jacks(on) can't match the switch-hitter, get a fit or two
Split a few lips when I flips a pitch like Cy Young
Die young, never ever try one
Soul is one that's mischievous, I'll twist your wrist so why son
Did you disrespect the father figure in your Rolex?
So head and solar plexus compressed as I flex
Thugs hug my slugs sprung from the Ville of Louis
Through the, joint to the point of pressure and then smoothly
Slipped off your valuables, you're mad I pulled another heist
Smothered twice, thrice, I thrash men and mice
My soul lies in my bat, I am one with my Easton
Once I grip the handle, the vandal is released and
Visions of viciousness are carried out with tactics
Slapsticks, but never comedy, it's _Batting Practice_

It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I've got a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a
It's like this and-a, it's like that and-a
I swing a Hieroglyphics baseball bat and-a
Aw shit! Hieroglyphics be tearing up shit!
Hieroglyphics is tearing up shit!
Hieroglyphics is tearing up shit!
Hieroglyphics be tearing up shit!

Good Feeling,Hiero B-Sides Vol. 1 ,UnKnown," x4
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
What you feeling?
GOOD FEELING, GOOD-GOOD FEELING


I'll flex your sex organs
Take your testes with hot wire cutters
Then detach them from your scrotum
Shove them down your throat
Injecting chlorofix in your anal orifice
With ice picks I slice dicks, and dice tricks
Feet when I slaughter, like I'm walking salt water
Cause I hog order, madness with nitric acid
And smash kids' testicles
When Phesto pulls a sledgehammer
By giving MCs convulsions, I make skulls bend

Attack your nervous system, causing epileptic seizures
Conniptions I rips and your head you'll be a freezin'
Your motor skills, a basket case
A slobbering vegetable
Rips festivals and I bets I'll pull your ho
I throw sets to your necks when I injects
Poison, I destroys men, I enjoys when
Your body quivers
I shiver with glee cause I be
Depleting your life forces always defeating

MCs: they're shrimps
We skewer them
A few of them got neutered when
We used the pen
Scalpel, ouch, ew!
Your mouth feel the 
pain
Thinner
, and then you use my penis
You're about to ball when you slide down a razor
Into alcohol
Pits and splits over hot shits
All this when you call this MC
I splits the backs of kids that's wack

I oppose foes that go and grab triggers
Them crab niggas make me want to stab niggas
Huh, 
I'm gutting brothers like fish
, I wish
I insist you put up your fists after I diss
Brothers riding half as great will have to wait
Go and masturbate, cause your ass was late
I'm past the state, I'm filled with everlasting hate
You get a cap peeling, now tell me how's that feeling?
 x4


Tajai be knocking kneecaps, filing elbows
Often we strappin'
You're firing hello to the tune of a crooner
You'll sooner catch pain, I fetch Drain-O
Claim I'm despisin', I'll dip your eyes in
""Him poisoned me!"" you will exclaim
I split main arteries
Leave you in hot lead if you're a hothead
Cause I've got dreadful schemes
Jelly gasoline burns your dermis
Until I feel that you learned this

Huh, I got a chainsaw now your brain's sawed
This is simple
This is what I tell fools that melt through
The bottomless pit
And now you're lit
I gotta split
Let your 
Never slip when I slaughter kids
I love extracting spines
So expect to find at my crypt
Lots of slain garbage kids
I don't talk no gangster shit
But I spank a kid
My shank gets split, when I got the dank to hit

Anuses and balls  in my basement
I swing and catch kids with my hatchet
Detach limbs with my rachet
Trimming spilling gastric juices
When I get killing, illing
Niggas is too simple
I'd rather heave a cleaver through your temple
And leave you crippled with the ripple
Cause I can  your stitches
When I switches the  comes with witches
You pull out  stiches when I inflicts it

Leave you bleeding on your knees
When I tear intestines out the back of mens
I'm dragging men with no skin
Over oceans, I flows and I make incisions
When I pulls my scalpel I alter decisions
Surgery but no painkiller
I mean I fill a syringe with battery acid
Leave you blasted
Half a casket, just like the last kid, you bastard
Torturing MCs cause I got the words massive

Bird’s Eye View,Focus,1998.0,"These words is like a giant squids tentacles
When I rip stuck to wax with razor sharp suction cups
In the back fuckin Mary Jane like Rick James
The uncontainable, chains flying out my cape
A Hiero spawn headed straight for the evil dominion
Where they be spinnin millions, killin hip hop
Stop manufacturing Glocks and tecs, selling sex
Telling us we all bullet proof
The virus is a bitch
But I'm swift, similar ??????
And I'm breakin shit down like calculus
Their mind is fragile and weak like popsicle sticks
First light you ain't feelin us you gots to be sick
Raps I'm engineering are piercin the mainstream
Military issue to your flak jacket, aiming
Straight at the puppet show, marionette rapper
Who trapped in a fairy tale soundin like a Macy's commercial
Everywhere we be we hypnotizing
Make your eye sting when I pass the mic smolderin
Plus you can't hold the thing it's eighty two hundred fahrenheit
Detonate right in your face like a letter bomb
Better stay calm and let that mother- nuh uh
Cool off, you too soft, actors gang bangin the movies
I'm like, ""Fool please, I'm from the City of Dope""
Where the police get smoked with fully AKs
And I didn't say that to glorify or praise
But that shit don't amaze you gotta change your equation
Show some innovation
The way I be lacin the mic with dope like a 
chewy blunt
Making you fall flat on your face
From the head rush, drastic measures
Avoidin all the scissor hands
Fumblin mics like dice redic'
The endless rhymes I write and rip
The great whites try to bite the stylistics
Growing exponentially
, they can't touch me
Your girl had sex with me but now she bug me
She's so lovely I didn't even trip
Cause I stay international and unpredictable
Ripping shows with the Souls, it's nirvana
And then I kick on back and smoke on 
Humboldt county marijuana
In the sauna, with Shawna
Sharper than a 
shuriken
, curvin and contortin
Give 'em the shakes like weeks off from coke snortin
Stay high in the sky like harp technology
Off a fat bag of broccoli killin the monotony
You niggas evil as a neo-nazi probably
Down with the president and workin for the Mafia
Straight scardy-cats, pimp like shits
While the invincible Hieroglyphics be unloadin full clips
Plowin recklessly into the bug-ass industry
I'm hittin A and Rs but I was shootin at the sea
Oh, ya know cause it's either him or me
So I picked his ass off heartlessly
You better keep the eyes in the back of your head
Peeled for the steel
If you down with demonics I'll warm you up like ionic heaters
Feel the intensity
Through your Sony speakers when I mix up explosives in the lab
In the beaker
Knock you up like ether
Rollin up expensive cheebas to blow it on my feezer
I use to love her 'til they drugged her and diseased her
Slugged her, took her in wilderness and killed the bitch
Now I insist upon the Eye for an Eye
Make a pilgrimage 'til the enemies sigh
Do-or-die style
Highly volatile like plutonium
Quicker than Napoleon, Kauffman, or Steve Austin
Lost us and remember Op from the way I twist the envelope
Rappers keep me in their laser scopes like assassins
But I'm down with The Professional
If you're blastin please stabilize your Canons
Set that motherfucker on a tripod, eyes on me
Or you'll wind up with three fatal exit wounds
Metaphorically of course
I keep the story vivid and mind boggling
Constantly revolving
Creating new angles for the squares
I'm infinitely dimensional
Never snared in a booby trap
It's automatic like an Uzi or a mac-10
With the pin filed down
The Hieroglyphics sound
The medicine, let us in for we fission bombs
Pin point precision when we mob on the mic
And robbing the likes of you and your crew
The Hieroglyphics boy what you gonna do",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-birds-eye-view-lyrics
93 ’Til Infinity (Music Video),UnKnown,2002.0,"Yo, whassup? This is Tajai
Of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin’ with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now, y’know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That’s the fattest stoge I ever seen
The weather’s heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

I get inspired by the blunts too
I’ll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this (Yep)
I need not explain this (Nah)
A-Plus is famous – so get the anus

Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick’s at eight, so get straight
You look great – let's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, ‘cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
(Uh-huh) this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

I be cool, schools in session but I'm fresh in
Rapping so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit, with my own clique
Roamin' these back roads, with a fat stoge and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts  with my persona
Plus bomber, zestin'
These niggas testin', my patience, but I stay freshin'

Restin' at the mall, attendence on 
But I am shopping for my wish to exploit
Jus' few fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein' dipped

Flip, the flyer entire female desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The ex – traordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

I'll mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, even when my crew gets
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (Smack)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope why ain't you signed yet
But I get – my loot from Jive/Zamba, Ima bomb ya
You will see, from now to infinity

Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til (Huh)
This is how we chill from 93 'til (Yo)
This is how we chill from 93 'til (Aw yeah)
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Hah-hah, just coolin' out, y'know what I'm sayin'?
But, but who's chillin' around the land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, Plus
Casual – you know he's chillin'
Yo, Pep Love – he gotta be chillin'
Jay-Biz – you know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, my man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike G – you know he's here chillin'

They can play though, not like them Czechs in Sarajevo
I got a family but I'm still that mean
I gotta feel that green - Agent Massey, how'd you kill that King?

I did it slickly, put a knife in his kidney
And sent him to bliss - made it look like some terrorists
The heir to his throne, eight years old
I left his back blown up, for that I get the FAT bonus
So the Cadillac's on once I get back home
But there's the mobile - plus the fax with my target profile
Yo, I blow up a church if I gotta
Orders from the top it don't stop til I gotcha, yeah
And when I do best to believe ya through
Cause we do not take prisoners in the good old U S of A
Too much red tape to Mas-sey
Plus the press say what they want to now-a-days
I'm gettin medals, for smart-bombin ghettos
Seven figure payroll, give you wings and a halo
We run things, so lay low, keepin paid
Those attempts to uprise we blow ya spot sky high
And bury ya - cause the lessa, you're the merrier
Comin soon a new shoppin mall if you don't bear
With the program - cold and callous, no man
Women, or child is safe (why?) cause we the wildest

Hoot and survive the rock

Disguised as rappez, but the lyrics are to massive
My syle has elasticity
I bounce back and take a new shape
You can't get with me

My brain has the capacity
To outlast mc's

Victory drums and that phat ass base line hummin'
Thinkin' about comin' up before the summer hit

You hear that fiendish cackle of mine
I've seen it many times
And I'm a say it again but remain unseen
Cause y'all niggas be sweatin'
Constantly remindin' me
I live amongst thieves who will bite these
But still they rhymes be spindly weight defficient

The inventiveness is what you can't resist
We gon' rock it like that, rock it like this

First of all for you pussies, don't take it personal
SOM is versatile, that is irreversible
I'm never submerged in a style
I'll break on out, while you are still trapped in trial
And error, catchin block like a cold
Soundin like the next nigga on the microphone
We ain't stole no lyrics, control yourself, ya hysteric
Prepare to spit, so don't experiment
You won't know where I went, shift in all directions
In attempt to escape but wait, the connection sets in
Aware of what terrors lurk, so I be alert
Assess the damage after I kick a verse
It hurts, stoppin rappers dead in they tracks
On wax, how can I be broken down or fractured?
The Fantastic Four attach words together like a latch
Or a clasp when we pass the mic
Yeah

Cast a laser light till you're corroded, you been spotted
Everybody want it, only one crew got it

And if rappers ain't gave respect, somethin they had best to
Got sisters damn near white to blackest night
Crowdin up the jock cause of how a brother rock it like
That, my raps is mad as a fact
That's why niggas dig 'em, kick up big ups and burn sacks
And wanna peel my cap, throw some dap
You couldn't match one of my freestyles if I was pervin off that Cali ac'
Watch out, the raps be curvin often
Comin from Eastbound to every funk shack the hip-hop crowd is at
Keep my rhymes off your tongue, boy, you bust a lung
Your muscle's gone, your crew cannot save you
When we up in this mode it's sewn
You get overpowered, and that's just how it goes


Don't even think that Hieroglyphics is gone, never that
Take a 4 to your dome to send you back
You wack, and I could never exist in such foul circumstances
Kickin raps to serve yo asses
At last it's some MC's who'd never steal a style from you
Nigga, we the Hiero crew
Marks, and better believe we gonna rock it for life
I know it all, y'all, we know it all, that's right
I'm livin tall, y'all, you livin small, no mic
Well I'm gigantic and never trippin off yo rhyme antics
The plot is we gon' leave you potless
You know we got this game for the biatches
Don't give a fuck really what coast you claim
A nigga like me only give love to who I'm close to, mane
Check it out, you motherfuckers step the hell on back
From the O and niggas know that we rock it like that

Yeah, it's Phes-Rock clockin big time dough
With your small time ho goin down like vinyl
You know, niggas try to play it off cool
Non-stop comedies all they ever gonna be
They never gonna see the light, I hit 'em
With so many variations in step
Imperceptably assertin every rhyme scheme
In your mind on the dime reconcilin
That tactical approach
Half these niggas with gats probably 'noid enough to shoot
Hieroglyphics got your back pilin through thickness
The boys in blue with bitches who allow us to respect them
Strictly as objects of sex to dick 'em down swoll
I never lose control, it's all an illusion
If my aim seems mainstream, I'm a virtuoso

Times Ain’t Fair,No Man’s Land,1995.0,"Everybody come on, get some get-up-and-go
Get rid of the no-can-do attitude
And expand and brace
Obstacles you face
Ain't no time to waste
Rhymin pays
Never was it worth doin crime, it stays
On your record when you try to get employment
I avoid it - like bein exploited
Couldn't leave my peoples disappointed
I know they want it
So I'mma flaunt it
You better get upon it
Cause life's a flash
It'll be here and gone just that fast
You better bust that ass
Nothing's inconcievable
Anything is possible, never let them deceive you

Life's full of dilemas, I contend to that
I be lookin out my window wonderin, ""What will I catch?""
Will it be...
A good job? Huh? Two to the head?
Maybe HI, say I can join the ranks of the livin dead
But hey, Tajai gotta press on
I'm late for class as I think of the choices my life rest on
I can buss my gat, cook some crack
Master calculus, build houses and make a stack
Either way
Depending on the dues I pay
No, you can't too but stick with it
You won't get it
If you lay or stall
And don't be in it for the long haul
You know they wrong, y'all
But we gots to get it on, y'all

Times ain't fair
But that's the way I play
No one can compare
And that's the way I stay
This is how we do it every singular day
So what you tryina say?
Well, let me show you the right way

If you're with me then you're all about makin money
So throw your hands in the air cause ain't shit for free
And nigga, Oakland California is the place to be
It gets hectic see, I disconnect to free
My mind and write rhymes
So I don't get caught up
Or get shot up
Plus the fuzz think I got the product
I don't cut lines up, I don't have to
But if you look like a playa, they harass you
I make cash doin shows from state to state
But still task wanna run the license plate
I don't trip cause it's all in vain
Your daughter knows my name
Ask the broad the game

People applaud the fam-ous, never lame
Just rhyme 'til your brain bust
You're wack and that's a shame
Cause I set examples, say in nine-trey
It's not Little Joe
I gots to rhyme a little mo'
So I'm finna go and scoop a forty-o
I'm under 21, but them Iraqis know me, so
To the show we go
Blaze up a stoge on the bridge, 8-0
A club with foes and fake hoes
I want high class bitches
With the ass that switches
When I get 'em, they be due soon as the Ad is finished
Make me feel like I'm livin on the wrong planet
Strong as granite
It's Souls with the song that's demanded


See, only the paid get to max and frolic
They got them wallets
So what's your holler?
Strive to be a scholar
Attract the knowledge gained
Whatever college, self-same
Attract a dollar's change
Don't get you far in this age
Turn the page and let the rage spill out the felt tip
Make the ladies melt, strip to the bone, I'm slick
Souls of Mischief comin sicker than the rest, confess
We press on, Hieroglyphics to the break, break of dawn
Now all ya fakes that's on the microphone, go home
I'm from the land, man, niggas make you roam with chrome
I stay at home, I like to bone, I'm grown
I got a flow that's known, in the O I hold my own
Yeah, baby come and have a seat with Phes
Together we can defeat the stress
And chill, if you got that sex appeal
I'll caress you till
The mornin, on and on and


And it's like that
You know what I'm sayin
Souls of Mischief in the house
With the Extra Prolific punch
We gon' give it ya like that
So I'mma bounce up outta here, uknowmsayin
I'll be back in 20 minutes

Remember Tabitha Smith
That's been my hard on since the fifth grade
Used to tell me nigga get paid
So we could be chillin'
Knew she'd be a millionaire
Feelin' 'em squares, stayin' up late
Doing her homework
Till he bones hurt
Solid as steel
Real as a day of atonement
Never live for the moment
That's why suckers they couldn't bone shit
Fool that body's a temple
Plus her older brothers just might lynch you
If you slippin'
Dreams of tinted windows in a benz-o
Graduated valedictorian, still smokin' indo
She was a whiz though
And I admire it
Finished up grad school
Now she mob a jaguar too
She never led she'd get maniacal
Kept her eyes on true ambition
That's how she livin' fat
Educated herself
Now she in a rack with six figures
Stacks of cashola I told her
Chorus (Opio):
Stay hustlin'
Watch for your enemies
Fool don't sneeze
You might blink for a second
Stay alert they like green berets
Checkin' your traps
With impeccable accuracy
Know where you at & where you be
(A-Plus)
Now everybody is a victim
If he a idiot I probably got a problem with him
About these women and that (pollyin'?) to get 'em
Maybe end up sorry that you hit 'em
Oh you was trickin' now a part of you is with 'em
I know plenty of those travel many roads
Went to extremes to receive every penny owed
Hella niggas be petty though
They eyes give 'em open and their actions let me know
So why give a fuck
All them answers lead to more questions
And if you're guessin' you's a poor specimen
More death to them
My demeanor changes
When I see the stages
Of a nigga schemin' before I beat him like Peter Gages
I listen to many morons, Let 'em go on
Wonder why they talk for so long they be like so on and so on
I examine who and what I think I know
Everybody's a victim is what I'm peepin' though, so
I hustle with friends
Even tussle with them
I ain't knowin' nothin' but them
Toughen the skin ha ha
Now it's all about your work ethic
In a word check it
In a word check it
Extended Chorus
(Opio)
Stay hustlin'
Watch for your enemies
Fool don't sneeze
You might blink for a second
Stay alert they like green berets
Checkin' your traps
With impeccable accuracy
Know where you at & where you be
Back to the scene of the crime with rubber gloves on
Tryin' to expose the cover up but there was none
So when the fuzz come
We say what's up to 'em
Cuz we untouchable & give a fuck
(Tajai)
V-12 pushin' like 80
Super sounds of Coltrane stainless
So I don't hydroplane
I kiss my lady and my baby
Told 'em things gon' be straight
Hopped out at the hospital gate
Now I'm a little late
But that can mean everything
Got an urgent page
Jetstream to the scene
Mask & gloves plus (D green?) scrubs
Open you up for the peaking
Grab my instruments and start tweaking this and that
Then stitch you back to near perfection
Avoiding all complications and infections
My occupation, the culmination of strenuous concentration
Lots of lonely contemplation
No time for impatience when you dream makin'
My reward is smiling faces on all my patients
Mobility, ability, to make changes
In a community ravaged by the savage collaborations
Of racists, but y'all can't say shit
I'm a hustle till I drop one day may save your kids

Fucked...,"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000,"Master of emcee slave trade
Pullin' chief executive chains on his muppets
The prime minister of shattered dreams
For these young black kids
Itchin' for this rap status
But he never could add up these b-boy mathematics
His pragmatic toys made him money magnetic
The abrasive weight of his unevasive vendettas
Made him keep two barrettas with his industry contingents
Ninjas, paid protection and fringe benefits
He rolls from the stretch Benz Limited Edition
Caught between a sinister smoke screen and henchmen
Straightened his lapel ignited his cigarette
And shoved the knot of his tie and awaited his death wish
Reckless manslaughter left him breathless
Mashed his chest it's a crash in the intersection
A fraction of a second
Spun out on the sidewalk
He couldn't pull his gun out
Cuz instantly
He was fucked in the industry

Is it real or imagery?
Senseless acts of savagery
Could it be you got fucked in the industry?
See it
You got fucked in the industry


Cause niggas get off in this business
Tryin' to come up
Awestruck, starstruck
But you know how they end up
See it
You got fucked in the industry
You know how they end up

Video queen type for whom you's feen
Appeared in many scenes
Fulfilling her childhood dreams
Got involved with this hardcore MC
Said she like to kick it and hang cuz he
Kept her clean
Expensive thangs, European names
Ice embedded amidst, ruby red flames she
Stayed in his mix, figured it was all a game
Swearin' that this nigga was her ticket to fame
But little did she know there was truth to what he's sayin'
'Bout how he made his livin' sellin' crack cocaine
'Bout how he put caps in all his enemies brains
I guess he missed the two that came checkin' for change
Didn't hear his pits squeal necks broke on choke chains
Baskin' in the glow of fuck faces they just exchange
Maxin' in his home, coolin' out just relaxin'
Niggas busted and cappin' while she was in between his
Satins and intravenous
Drip her failing heart rate blip
And the bloody mattress
The sole legacy of this budding actress
Coroner lights and cops cameras followed the action
I wasn't surprise but rather saddened when it happened

Cause niggas get off in this business tryin' to come up
Awestruck, start struck
But you now how they end up

The devious life you get touched
See it
But you know how they end up

Down in San Diego at the Gavin
I seen a hip-hop journalist get stabbed
That shit was savage
Caught him in the stomach with about four inches
Slapped him in his face relentless
And pulled out some big shit
He said look homie, you don't know me
Put the gat to his head calm and slowly
The journalist screamin' and cryin' scared of dyin'
Dude mashed him in his jaw with the barrel
Told him STOP LYIN'
Picked him up off his knees with ease
I thought he might squeeze
'Til I heard the police yellin' FREEZE!
He reached for the heavens
Eleven cops put his head in a (shuminumaki?)
Blood on the concrete
That's when I peeped dude that shanked him was a rapper
Hot cause his name got slandered
Locked in a metal case for over a decade
He thought he was invincible
But now he wish that day never happened
Askin' his God for forgiveness
Purgin' is harder than vengeance tryin' to end this nightmare
The industry clockwork oranged his whole shit
And warped his brain until he flipped out
Is that what is about

Talkin' big when you little man they called you out
Shoulda kept your shit shut

That's why I cut class everyday it felt like prison
Poppin' at your ex-girlfriend in detention
Tossed her in the library got my duck sick then
The next day I was jalapeno dick pissin'
Raw (that need?) the vixen on a suicide mission
Bad bussiness the pussy had me mystified
Couldn't trust her but I risked my life
Bad business my dog as my witness
Tried to act church girl religious
She had a hit list
Bad business lucky what if syphillis
Or the monster
What you got that all for a boo?

That's bad business
Spendin' all your time wastin' your time
That's bad bidness that's bad bidness
Yeah what do we have behind curtain
Number three, ghetto fantasy
Young buck sixteen, in a state of emergency
Got you thrown in juvenile hall
Cause you toss a marked car it's stupid
Fit out a Lakeshore
But you wanna bounce over the hill to thirteen?
That's bad bidness
Ten dollar genocide is senseless
You wanna be a pharmacist?
All you doin' is harming us
What about Paris Robinson
Medgar Evers and Huey
They kicked you out of Oakland High
Now you cuttin' up your doobie
You'll be the butt of a few jokes
Like Joey Buttafuoco, don't goof up
And let your youth go lil' bro

You can short the youngstas
But who's this fist clinched
With a gat pointed at you damn dude that's bad business
You rollin' with your homie Johnny
In a stolen Mobby
You lookin' slow and groggy
Man get your folks some coffee
You prob'ly ain't trippin' cause you off weed
Then he speed crash now your ass got a broken body
That's bad bidness
Messin' with women with mental problems
Two of my homies got killed like that
They up in some coffins
Stabbed in they sleep
That shit is deep
Prob'ly just got done waxin' they freaks
Peep that's bad business

When your mind is occupied with thoughts
Of misdeeds hopin' you don't get caught
That's bad business
When the truth is obscured
Made impure
The speakers of it aren't sure anymore
That's bad business
When promises are made that you have to break
Spoken in vain for accolades
That's bad business
When you accept a wrong
Instead of correct a wrong
That shit ain't to be slept upon
That's bad business
When ain't no one in the world
You can call a friend
Cuz you done screwed
All of them
That's bad business

And recognize you've become all that you despise

Redirect your motivation, while we collect the dough forsaken
Making a mockery of you MC's, we grimace malicious parodies
You're finished, allowing you to win is just not in us
That's horrendous just replenish apprentice retract all
The wack 'fore you niggas get blackballed, you're small
And we make a spectacle of y'all withdrawal
Punk contention bitten for attention
Souls of Mischief your worst, enemies, your energy's
Wasted, disintegrated, you'll be incinerated
By the innovative when I'm stimulated come pale
To embellish I relish MC's overzealous who fail us
Time will tell us, emulating recreation is colorless
Frontin like they on some other shit
Developing discover this irrelevant to wack intact exact
Well I belittle MC's, and hold no reefer
But sho don't sleep I'm out
Verse Two: Tajai
We the fruits of rotten seeds, nowadays it's bout greed
That's the policy, get from me, so I grab all I see
And after that we out, in a trail of laughter
Raps and doubtless claims of standards upheld and maintained
This ain't no, flash in the pan shit, just sell it and fade to nada
Or dance hits to propel, a major knot up in my billfold
One day I got up and I willed no rapper greater
They fake as dildos and act like they young as fuck
Hollerin about the niggas they buck
Fallin out the windows made up like hoes if they get bucked
Lesson utmost, japanitos to one broke
Who have an ego, or fade you like vita largo
Damn where did he go? Sucker felt the evil I know, word

The West eclipse the rest, suggestions, to the ones in my profession
Testin, congestin, the mic doin impressions
Souls of Mischief make em all fall in succession
If you're pressin luck self destruct
I'm vindictive, so descriptive
Intriguing on the mic, we don't see things alike
I strike at breakneck speeds and leave you think twice
'fore I sink ice cold lyrics and you're sliced
Through the mirror and it's right to the center
Where it hurts, convert
Reconsider the bitter, consequences
You're defenseless against us, you go berzerk
Ingesting MC's like clockwork, when I rock
Murderous rhymes one time for your mind
And drop dimes for them niggas who don't get live
Verse Four: A-Plus
I reduce you to dust piles
Plus styles'll crush smiles, seducing women til they bust out
Of they garments, always give the crowd what they wanted
I rock the mic and now, they don't want you on it
So I own it, I make my grip tight
It's like I'm nuttin nice when I'm writing rhymes to cut and slice men
You wouldn't, I win every time that we clash
I will surpass ya, A-Plus a known flasher
Rhyme if you wanna, it makes no difference
Cause you still gonna die, youse a goner
You shouldn't even try, why was you on the
Mic in the first place
You even chose tbe track, see yousa nigga with the worst taste
I make you niggas disperse with haste
My tape first with bass hurts your face we curse the fates
I think that I should be your human idol

Don't try to play that role
Let's get real and hit the sack
It ain't all like that

Let me take control, just relax


I demonstrate the skills that niggas need to flow
They need to heed a bro
But even so I still leave you, though
You know I never understood about wack
Ain't nothin good about wack
It's all shit, that's what my niggas call it

Perhaps your luck is less
Black, you flunked the test, yes
And you will never pass

Now y'all MC's'll get ransacked
See I'm the man, black, stand back
This is what yo plan lack
The proper use of flows
I can mop a crew of foes
You hoes that don't do your own rhymes got to chew the pros?
The buddha flows with a sack from the 4
From '93 til we chilled, now we back in the door
But now it's gruesome when a crew's dumb
So I gotta bruise 'em

Out of conrol from the soul
Makin money, don't stop
To the fellas never jealous, celebrate the fact

Fightin allegory, we retaliatory, anticipation, this shit’s amazin
And dese snicks are praised in ways

There’s another side of you that you need to see

Outti 5 rowdy time for calamity
This isn’t happenin, this is a track an this be happenin for real
I refuse to let d agony build
I’m losin ma sanity still need a attic for strategy an chill
Think back if you sad an billin wit d raggedy feelin
The scantily clad hoe
Had to be dem assholes, mad at they souls
Remember at the show they whole faculty practically froze up
Dassin an doped up, I bet they whole faculty coked up an smoked out
Get d cinder block an d ropes out scopes on d tower wid a power boat
Quicksand’s in d hour glass is a flashback to d previous circle of circumstances
Cause I don’t even understand this whole situation, it’s outlandish
I’m in a mareeo famish the blank canvas, just vanish with no trace scandals
I can go expect delay on catalysts, activist let’s rewind time

’94 Via Satellite,No Man’s Land,1995.0,"Yeah
Yeah, y'all niggas don't know nothin about this
What that nigga say? Enrich Oakland funk
Hah, gonna take that shit serious

Man fuck an MC
I got a tip that's fat and lengthy like a 40 pistol
For your missus, baby she'll do me 'fore you miss this
Sporty shit whips your man senseless
Them obese hits, with thick wrists, so spin them ten bits
And come up, like these sucker punks won't even run up
And speak, we the reason that your shit is called weak
And y'all our liveliehood, as long as it's understood
The crew be rippin this, and you be strippin this
Like it was hubs, why? Because we cuttin them dubs
So fuckin fat, that you gotta bite that, we got it like that
I'm not no type actor hoopster singer or nuttin
We'll hook the track up, and I'll become the, decisive factor
Yeah!! .. Y'all niggas can't dream to think about this shit
You can bite it
But by that time it'll be too late cuz it's already been recited
Come rip this shit

Ha ha ha ha!!
I try not to be, too tempermental
Everything I do yes it's true it's meant for mental renovation
With innovation laced it, embalmin fluid
Flew it through your speaker do it make you want to seek your soul
Like Nat King Cole, my shit is gold
I hold a pole of polarity, like a wand and fondle phrases
Ages, before you ever heard a lion roar
My minions were preparing for my birth to unearth the black core
The pearl of persistance to keep your interest
Keep evildoers outside with fences
I make my rhymes audible and portable and sort it for
The burst of energy cuz it's affordable of course
There's more to throw, to the sharks, and modify the marks
Perhaps I use a parable of Rosa Parks, on the front of the bus
I don't discuss coming less than us
Dirty devils never ques-tion us!!
Yeah, Hieroglyphics in the house, Souls of Mischief
Yeah check it out

It's the grill buster, the ill Plus-ter
My skills must abominate, niggas who ain't rhymin great I debate
The situation's critical; the shit you say is pitiful
Your skill tank is empty and my shit is full
Went to school unleaded
No one in this world ever said it
Get beheaded by the crew dreaded, MC dicer, I'sa
Little bit wiser, but yo my shit is nicer
The ill price you pay is this, I slice MC's with my greatest hits
We take no shit in rap, that's it, you wack
So get your ass on, nigga bomb
Be in the cut 'fore I get my blast on
Nigga earl's how you're comin at me, so I'mma brandish MC's
Until they vanish with ease, causin damage with these
Yeah!!
Souls of Mischief in the house
Hieroglyphics, Opio come rip this shit for the crew

Yeah, one two one two
Who me?? Yeah see I'm only out for one thing
Domination, encasin MC's chasing they dreams
Evaded and slipped clean through the system
Mauled shaken-up and touchy cuz we dissed em
Bitch you need to listen to this one
The tension thickens, your heart rate quickens
Damn near beatin out your chest, ya can't predict what's next
I bet conviction is stressful, MC's that bite they wrestle
With the mic, all night, hopin to recite
Excite, captivate the crowd, make my momma proud, now
And forever will I drain, Souls of Mischief supreme
The crown tipped, to the side, you don't wanna collide
A landslide victory for the team they all died
Nigga, yeah, it's like that and-uh, it's like that and-uh
It's like that and-uh

A Hieroglyphics yeah
Clearly distinguished from these incompetent niggas
Playin possum with the mic, suckin peanuts
Tryin to be Phes, freak it with a twist
But missed, by a long shot, I hope they all flop
I manipulate the mic as a concussive force
No remorse for, preluckin MC's
I couldn't be cut with, the keenest of blades
Holstering the limits of pressing in it, projecting my image
Like a hologram, reanimatin MC's
Shamrock deceased, base Phes jus dissipated the rest
A waiting antihistamine is distressed and jaded
Phes escalated as the mack of all trades
Yeah, uh-huh
Souls of Mischief, Hieroglyphics, throw your hands in the air c'mon!
Yeah, you know we don't stop

Airborne Rangers,"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000,"Rap slash out these battleship torpedoes that'll rip through
Your fragile ego, ransack your evil empire like I was Genghis
The Khan/con artist, fiendish, on target, laser beam shift
Trackin your movements like The Pentagon
Disarm the meanest lookin studio prankster
Endangered, we airborne rangers with the broken language
Absorbin blows every game I strength (What?...)
The Chinese connection game of death
You might see me in the reflection in the chain on his neck
Controllin these mics while he aimin his Tek
Couldn't even hold it still cos his hands was all wet
Said we a threat cos we the heaviest
And with a strobe light in his progress you'll never be fresh
You can't murderlise a survivalist
Fool we thrive on this shit, the third eye is too swift

All we gotta do is provide the music, ugh
Don't need a Lac on Deez to make your bitch hop on my lap
And lap on these, lavishin please don't tease
To all these way-below-average MCs
You gon' stay below, don't wish, that's just how it's gon' be
My style is on levels unattainable, recyclable and reusable
But not biodegradable so don't confuse em
They last eternal, evil gas that's acid turned
When I spit it, unmatched fashion over da riddim
Unabashedly, leave sights only extreme sides of gassing
Mic mastery, necessary steps to make you genuflect
I reflect the genuine and accept
Nothing less than your respect in excess
I wasn't expecting the success that I met
When I grabbed my shit and left command
Won't let it get too ahead, I got a check on that
Check you spice rack, it's certain elements you lack

We combust when we contact
Come correct with the contract
Show respect when we stomp packs
You get cut for the combat
Got the specs of your launchpad
Snatch ya bitch when we rock that
Interception, she out back
Undressed off the twamp sack, blessed off the cognac
Take her back, we don't want that, no not that

I don't rap for the money but I'm lovin that it pays well
Sometimes I kick a strange tale, make your brain swell
Souls tighter than lifers sittin in the same cell
I never listen to the drama that a dame sell
I'm tryin to make that mail so I sought the game well
I know the spell from the rattle of a snake's tail
When a hard nigga spray and the enemies lampale
I'm witta female that was waitin, make her exhale
I'm Double X-L like the magazine is
And fuck the drugs but I can show you what a rappin fiend is
Perhaps my team is NOT the type to act the meanest
But on my birth, you're just a falling Earth, you gettin smacked to Venus
Stings are jackin the penis so your label accept
Cos you ain't able to rap or able to wreck
I'm claimin respect with rappin that'll strangle your neck
Claim you're a vet but still I'm makin you jet, shakin the set

I'm unique with this on three hundred and fifty cubic inches
Of horse-powered fuel injection, positive traction
Throttlin action, my prerogative's idlin
Mind bogglin speed tobogganin streets of Oakland
Old English Old English, the kingpin
Swingin like Charlie Miggetts
High wire torch, swallowin, spine tinglin
Break your vertebrae's with permanent turnicans
Firm burn your sternum like nerve gas and germ, warfare
Hor, d'oerve you serve, your Sequoia Heights in Stirling
Minted, quartered your terms is centric
Circumventin the industry
While your fate remains in the chains of imagery portrayed
And mass media hype, we smash media rights through mics
Crack through the core at the speed of the light
I'm ????? ???? ????, graffiti on mics
The beaters are white, forever sweet and precise for me to ignite

UGH!
We combust when we contact

Last Night,"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000,"Last night!

Was incredible, unforgetable
Seen some ass MC's
Had to let'em know
Last night!

Had put my thang down
Got my thang on
Did my thug thang
It wasn't a thang wrong
Last night!

I thought it was just my mic level
I can't hear myself & Plus turn up the echo
Last night!

I took a five hour plane flight
Spittin' at my homegirl via satellite
Last night!

Idea was top the secret
And you wouldn't belive it unless you peeped it
She was off the chain, all-terrain
All insane alcohol stalled her brain
Last night I caught the right weed
Had my body slow-mo but thoughts at light speed (last night!)
Was a long one I was on one, a strong one
Smoke it 'til it's all done
Last night!

We out we out we out
Forty miles over the speed limit
On target like a bullet to the knees
From the SWAT team when I'm
Shootin' these in 'em
Trigger kamikaze but two shots are hidden then
Step into the station (Pass A-Plea the venom)
So we can take a sip and let the poison get in 'em
Ink off the mic like a vortex without a bitch or a Lex
I get more affection
Payin' no attention cause I learned my lesson
Cold hearted bitterness so I never sweat them (last night!)
Starstruck the Hollywood hoes in action
Master your high watch out they backstabbin'
Last night!

Chillin' where the city lights flash bright
Burning rubber in a riddle livin' in the fast life
That's right
I saw the last of my ID's
One too many a dem Long Island ice teas
Act right
You thought you was the life of the party
Feelin' light hearted off the lime and Bacardi (last night!)
I seen your girl at a red light
Too conditioned for your highness but we did it all night
Last night!

Last night I spend my whole night out
Met some hoes outta fest for low riders
Mind hunters, lip gloss shine & hypnotizin' minor men
And like a fool I invite 'em into my ride
When we was already high but with tequila sunrises
Jack & mai tais
It was all over
Wished I stayed sober cause I don't know what
Happened and niggas keep on laughing (last night!)
Oh that's right
You was poppin' at the cutie with the big backside
Last night!

Yeah I was watchin' movies on my sofa
Knowin' Susie'd soon be comin' over
Last night!

I cracked a cold one
Then I smoked some but lost a whole bunch
Last night!

We lit up the premium blend
Hit it again and again and make the world spin
Last night!

I rolled across the Golden Gate Bridge
Headed for the O with Pep and Jay-Biz
Last night!

I got paid before and laid after
(Up in?) the mic and broke bread at the tabernacle
Last night!

I'm sleepin' from drinkin' too early in the evenin'
And Hennessy had me hurlin' and heavin'
Last night!

Last night I broke on through to that side
Party til my body capsized
Last night!

I saw the (locs plus it's off the tushes?)
Lookin' voluptuous in capri's and petal pushers
Hair brushes had us watchin' for the black and whites
Evadin' the sobriety checks and spotlights
Last night!

I smoked a bomb sack facial
Then I got a call from this girl I hate bro (what?)
She said I'm comin' by don't think that I'm a H-O
I'm thinkin' how you know I was on the eighth floor?
Last night!

Last night was scorchin', blazin'
An overload of endorphins
This motorola is just torchin'
Act like I be actin' brazen
A'k the ladies
I may push it but don't force it
Last night!

This way configurate when we skate in a caravan
Kickin' up dust and disappear in a sand storm
Mash on the gas aim direct and escape
To the next experience we do it heavyweight
Lat night!

Got pulled over by the po-pers
Wasn't sober they let me go but they took all of my dosia
Last night!

We was compact deep in the backseat
Goin' tone deaf from distorted fifteens
Last night!

Check it out they was movin' too slow
I was in the fast lane with the cruise control
Last night!

If you missed us catch us next time we ride
Cuz you know we do it right
Last night!",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-last-night-lyrics
Sup Doder (What’s the Re?),"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000," How do I know you're any good?
 I'll give you a free sample
 And if you like it we'll team up
 If not, no hard feelings
 Fair enough

Indeed her body is bad true
Her hair is wit
Mos def, I'm impressed by her style of dress
A retro, strange get up
Lookin' like a Betty Page pinup
Make me wanna release the pimp in me
Who stays pent up
For days like these skirts lit up
Boustiere the type to tease
Rosy lips have me frozen stiff
Watchin' her tongue flick
As she rolled a spliff
I approached amidst the smoky mist
Spoke to the Miss in ways I'm known to
And once transfixed by my gaze
We moved on to
Bigger and better nightcaps
To relax the synapsys syntact
That make her want to contact my mattress
Tumbling gymnastics
Is calculated movements no time for fumbling
She shucked her clothes
Contorted into a pose, I
Couldn't oppose the long stem rose
Protruding for my robe, she strolled to the windows
And made for sho' the shades was closed
And then I ""supdoder?""
Then I ""what's the re'd?"" her
Then I or g'd her

Shit I had to meet her
Freak her like Derek Jeter did Mariah
Orgasm messiah nigga I freed her
Her boyfriend's a crack dealer
Flashin' on her straight wife beater
Drawn down with the nine heater
Tryin' to slap the handcuffs on her when he the criminal
Real women know you can only pimp a ho
Don't try to get physical
Cuz she gon' suck another dick
And oh it might be mine
I bust her out she walkin' pigeon-toed
Then I cast with the fishin' pole
Catch her in the indigo see-through
She feel an O
And it's oh Jesus
Cause she's just the type to let me have it all, see
So I had a ball

I hit it, I did it I admit it
And we did it, and we did it, and we did it, and we did it
Say you're g'in (g'in?) g'in
But anyway they beg for more and that's for sure
I hit it, I did it I admit it, I never quit it
Sup doe, sup doe, SUP DOE!
Supdoder then I ""what's the re'd?"" her
Then I g'd her

Now, the Souls niggas don't say ""What up love"" or ""yo""
We see a pretty thing and be like ""Sup doe!""
She prob'ly wit' it if you keep your body fitted
If you bumming with no money she bouncin' like somebody shitted
But that's cool though, cuz in the rules bro
Win or lose there's always someone else to choose yo
That's the case in this rat race
Whether she skinny and pretty or bangin' with a wack face, I
Met a broad on the street, she said call her Denise
Sportin' a green Nautica fleece
Ha, that's cute prob'ly her man's coat
That'll stop me the day I see somethin' on land float
Put in your hand wrote the phone number down
About a week and two days passed
Plus wanna slumber now
Supdoder, then I ""stammine'd"" her
Then I g'd her

Yeah it's permanent work on my hip, I'm that swift
Terry Kirby and Terrell Owens had a fifth
You know them two live crew
Dancer short and make you thick
Hawaiian black siren lookin' like Salma Hayek
With inflated pecs she playin' water polo
'Bout to start a riot at the Hyatt by the Colliseum what's the re
I'm like sup doe! I see it's all (fiat?)
She said ""what's that in your sweatpants a six foot kayak?
Frightened' like she on a dick diet had me inspired
At times you can say her mouth put up a whole lot of silence
The whip cream shootin' on her ass, tits and thighs
I'm no Cassanova but I pole her while I hold a Motorola
And rollin' dosia if I know she's sober
That I only light in the room at the flash of my busy busy Minolta
She electrify when I'm erect with sexual voltage
Bust out pole position if she fuckin' with the Souls Of Mischief

I hit it, I did it I admit it
So then we did it, and we did it, and we did it, and we did it
Say you're g'in (g'in?) g'in
But anyway they beg for more and that's for sure
I hit it, I did it I admit it, I never quit it
Sup doe, sup doe, SUP DOE!

Push the button and the planet blows
That ain't right
Niggas be actin' like animals
That ain't right
Bustin' cannons when they brandish those
That ain't right
Put the mayor in a stranglehold
That ain't right

What? My firm is intense
Leave permanent imprints
A nigga was a infant when
I learned I was gifted
Knew I'd be eternally lifted when I get my turn to rip it
Certainly did and we still in the shit
We forever increase and never decease
Saliva flips when a geek endeavor to speak
Whenever Plea and the four horsemen
Kick your doors in
You shiverin'
Like a drunk nigga with no mo gin
One more again
Rollin' with the sons of the sun
I got love when I come
Put away your gun that's dumb
Whe ain't sissy nigga my folks got some
But I never the one that want to be fuckin' up the fun
Cause I rather have some female company rubbin' me
Sippin' bubbly lookin' lovely in front of me hah
Then I ride out to the Hiero hideout
And my lady friends slide out
Garments regardless if I turn the light out

That ain't right, that ain't right!
Curse like a gat burst
That ain't right
Ride to church in a black hearse
That ain't right
Roamin' the turf on a crack search
That ain't right

It's all radio music, corny as the rockettes
Mindless sex objects make the cock get rock hard
So you can't concentrate or see what's next
While they spray the pollutants
And lock down your district and send in lieutenants
Shootin' up your boulevard while you was watchin' MTV
Double connect pinched caught you slippin' instantly
You was a prisioner they plottin' on your seeds
Souls Of Mischief is different we operate on thieves they panic more
Sniff 'em out like black labradors
Battle ram doors crackin' down on your headquarters
Avalanche yours 'til you're buried alive
Your homie barely survived the rest is dead caught up
Haters want my head shot up so I'm preparin' to fight
Whether aryan knights or sherriffs of vice
Nigga I'm equipped like a terrorist to tear up shit right

In life everything's fair
That ain't right
That's way a nigga don't share
That ain't right
Your girl left you for a square
That ain't right
And now you see him everywhere
That ain't right
Man I'm hella broke and jobless
That ain't right
My sister does mornin' topless
That ain't right
The lied to us and robbed us
That ain't right
And if you ain't livin' right
That's death that ain't life

As they come in to great depths
We surpass the summit
Stranglin' rhythmic arrangement elements transpose and plummet
I take it back to my roots, vast and infinite
Composition is crafted intricate, jazz I rip it &
Passion indica, smash your syndicate
Before they can ask for sentiments and flow tear gas your tenements
After I flash the emblem
A symbol of the last millenium
Who the best boy?
Yeah we askin' anyone
Peg your chest and
Crush your velvet, shatter your pelvic
Hard hat or your helmet spin in the cockpit of a plane
And the tail spins
Still my satin smooth
Patented moves raps scat and
Scoop fatten the groove flatten your crew
Could happened to you
Word it's my propensity to cut back
Instantly change direction at my point of attack and leave tracks
Dilapidated, handicapped and incapacitated
When I ex-sling I silk screen these words in your chest
Spit the verbal infernal burn MC's like Oakland herbal
And I do it faster than the grand national & twin turbo
With a Jose Cuervo
That ain't right
Nah for real though
That ain't right

Prophecy is my offering
Fuck profiting off these profligate tales
These mental paupers be proffering
I await patiently till the time is proper to propagate
My intellectual property
Concentrated abated then trick ya and release it
In synchronous increments
Seemingly seamlessly
I'm a semanticist
Prayin' like many a mantis is
Though I'm not meanderin' answerless
Meditation that's my medication
Concentration leads to consternation
And conceptual inception
Interspersed interjections
Incite insurmountable insurrections
In the urban sections
Stretchin' my sharpest weapon
Precise etchin's of life's lessons, scaled and detailed to perfection
My imagination, the machinations of deceptive perception
Come, inspect my collection

Man they shootin' at the product
That ain't right
I left her at the bus stops
That ain't right
You just a late night option
That ain't right
Man I would never trust no cop nigga

I'm getting rich off these tricks

No need to be lagging
We should react

Nothing but impure unadulterated hatred tryna crush your face

Deleted from the planet, closed casket

Give, or don't give

We all gotta leave one day
And I know it's gonna happen to me one day
But this situation needs com play
Put it up to his temple and he gone pray
What would my people say
If they knew I was caught up in this evil game
People forgetting that we the same
Look at the devil cause he's to blame
Maybe we too cocky, self indulgent, and egotism
Not to mention that if I stoop down to their level then it'll be me in prison
The other side of me is fighting me, telling me ""We should kill em""
It's seeping into my soul I need to behold a deeper vision

Hold on, plea breathe for a minute
Let's think before we bring the reaper in it
Man I barely seein' them niggas
And the last thing that I wanna be is sitting
Off in a 6 by 8

You know you trippin', Tajai

Fuck it, headshots, smacked with a cannon
Smash a nigga nuts with a hammer
Burn all the mutts in the kennel
Nobody getting to the spittle
Leave no clue to the riddle
But fuck it, let's get em, gone
How many thumpers we sittin' on
Call Black Ice for the Black Ops
All black knights finna blackout
Shady this, shady this, lives at dawn
Then we burn the evidence on the black block


Word to mom
I feel my brothers in arms, I'm ready to purchase armor
Better believe the voice for reasons ask Phes if he ever heard of karma
Gotta be smarter, transponder, new jerk reaction is liable
To leave all four of us martyrs, at the coroners office but the odor is toxic
Can't be overly cautious, food for the soul, we'll end up either
Headed for hell, dead or in jail, devil prevails, who's in control?
Us or them? Crash in the barrel, two to the dome, using the scope

Exchange in the green, see the one and only Stoney
And he's hot as Molotov kerosene
You can hear the megawatts hella blocks away
Felons, cops, and party girls sponsors poppin collars
Spitting knowledge and it's quite fitting, written
Off top in the sky crimson , but I got night vision

I ain't tripping
It's a party full of naughty and nice women
It would be nice to finally put me some pipe in em
You know we needed to get all fucked up our nights a bit
But this ain't the time for the lights of them
I have been through hella shit this week
So Ima buy some gin and I'm spinning a freak
Never admitting defeat, cause Ima try again
With my considerate speech, this nigga is deep, get him a leash
It's hella women plus my niggas surrounding me
What you niggas drinking? Opio, the first round's on me!

A plea with the goons in the black futon
We eating hella shrooms, and peepin in
Fresh connection, just to get a rep, they flexin'
I'm like ninja man my weapon
Restin the small on my back with one of the straps
Sipping cognac with  on ice
An unforgettable night, I step on the mic, I'm devastating
Put the metal in the face of whoever hating
Not the same since they grabbed my people
Fucking psychopathic, he's nothing to lethal

From the VIP room, I can see dude
And 9 times out of 10, he be clutching his eagle
But we gotta make amends for what the fuck he put me through
How to wreck em here, guess we'll touch him with these tools
Teeny 2-5 up under the suicide
I'ma need a close-up, put something between his eyes
So I proceed the plot on how to make him ride
No time to teeter-tot, it's time to make it hot
Hit the liquid courage, click the little burner
Trick and make the brother the victim of a murder

But, Before we hurt em, brother we gotta think of this
Can't just shoot him in the club in front of hella witnesses
Gotta find a small way, maybe this nigga would visit us
I ain't okay with it if we not getting away with it
Just sayin' shit, we need to figure this out fast

Twisted with the mouse trap, later with a cheese grater
Let the weed sedate him, it's a weed trader in his home
Wanna put a deep crater in his dome
Wired detonator to his phone
Let him play the role, infiltrate the throne

How can we get him out the building alone?
Into the danger zone, the reign is gone
Go mongo Genghis Khan on this mono
Man it's on, make his blood stain the floor
I can't wait no more, okay? Let's go

I'm waiting, let's floating
High up the crime rate and open
Tajai approached him
Womack was towed back from too many double jacks with cold backs
My whole camp swarmed like green barrages
In Jesus' name, crusade squeeze and aim
Now feel the pain, the steel of shame
How does it feel on the other side of a  in your brain?
Might splatter, matter of fact, drag him in back
Seen Stoney in the cut, he was grabbing a gat
Then put it to the temple of Womack's simple mind
And told him, ""Revenge is MINE.""",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-the-last-act-lyrics
93 ’til Infinity (a cappella version),93 Til Infinity,1993,"Yo whassup, this is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland, California and, um
Sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill
(1)
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration
(2)
I get inspired by the blunts too (too)
I'll front you (you) if you hang with a bunk crew (chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!
(3)
Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the gut, the cinema, was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her
(4)
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
Cause the man's all that
All fat - I be the chill from 93 'til
(Chorus: S.O.M.)
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til
(5)
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business, I cause dizzyness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch
(6)
Yo, crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
Yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close, kid
(7)
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
Or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the hoe in's
Basement, my ace spent
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid
(8)
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks we can max pumpin fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts, cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit
93 'Til Infinity - kill all that wack shit
(Chorus)
Hah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til
Yeahhh this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til
(9)
I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
Rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own click
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin
Niggas is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and
(10)
Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
Some cute fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped
(11)
Flip - the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The ex..traordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her
(12)
I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)
Loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get - my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity
(Chorus)
Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
Huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
Yo, this is how we chill, from 93 'til
Aww yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how.. we chill, from 93 'til
(Outro)
Hah-hah, just coolin out, y'know what I'm sayin
But, but who's chillin around the land y'know?
Yo, who's chillin? I think I know who's chillin
Yeah tell me who's chillin then then Plus
Casual - you know he's chillin
Yo, Pep Love - he gotta be chillin
Jay Biz - ya know he's chillin
Aiyyo man, my my man Snupe is chillin man

You haven't been snared and trapped

Can’t wrap my head roun it
She don’t want him
Anyone not him
Insecurity locked in
Fed jealous rage
Yea I’m clearly been   in
Set the stage
Now I’m here at her arms length
Nicky and her orange juice thought it was far fetched
Caught her while she’s talkin to her man on Park Crest
Feel guilty conscience as soon as her palms sweats
I know it’s it her blood stream
So why stiff
Everything sounds strange
I’m seeing double all of a sudden
I can’t call it I’m buggin
I got a problem or somethin
Poundin all in my noggin
Knees knockin and wobblin
Feel like I’m speakin to Goblin

Are people callin my name
Is it all in my brain

Colluding with the losers
I hallucinate, I can’t recuperate
I’m lubricated, translucent
Losing weight
Wait
I don’t know what to say to ya’ll
All I know is I make it to the top
At the top of the bar two player’s small
Dog get this brawd before she fall and catch a law suite
How you mean she doesn’t even drink
What you want fool
This is cool, this is not you
Somethin seriously wrong
But I got you
No dude
Just come with me outside
I wanna run in the street and see if I can fly
Lights flashin
Smashin pass traffick

Please God don’t let her leave
A steady stream of 
Gon take the best of these medics to stem it
Vendetta is set in motion
I’d never forget it
Or let it go
I keep the pressure on your womb
Thinkin bout my seed that’s restin in your womb
Seconds move like minutes
My mind is spinnin
But time is slow motion
And I have no notion of what’s next

Dying, peroxide flyin
This is homicide
The mama survive

Meeting of the Minds,There Is Only Now,2014.0,"Mi and Womack, a cold cat
Who rolled crap
Sold crack to his uncle
And neva was pro black
No tatts lookin clean cut
But he really dirty
Bro strapped with the 38
Pimp slap your girl
Off the coniac
Snap cone dac

Until he collapsed

Waterfall tap then her tell em
Hold back
A known fact that he bought
A fool lately
Got a thing for Miriam
But she been with a dude lately, too shady
That’s how his mind work when he find 
He don’t like stoney like I making sure his mind work
Hold in you faces, a reminder
Any philly that ain’t be feelin him ridin with Rhonda
Seem like a real rider
That chick need guidance
Couple seconds beside her see that he
She see that he ain’t bout it
Meet Miriam
Miriam was raised by her sister and them
And her mother and father she always quit listenin to em
Mom saw her spirit glistening since her christening
Use to practice discipline but Stoney why she get with him
It’s a sin, good girls don’t be sippin gyn
She straight laced
But her parent thinks she needed in-tervention
Mixing in with the criminal element
Until she guessed only as she was celebrate
The elephant in the room was evident
Zealous vigaments
What attracted Womack to her innocence
In a sense Stoney never seen him as a imminent threat
When he and Miriam got intimate
Living a myth
The tenements
The village stench

Don’t feel underexposed to wrongs
But she got her eyes wide open through
Meet stoney
Homie stole cars from the edge
Had holes in his 
Then he paid his spread on his favorite thoroughbred and broke bread

No shit
They sayin Stoney don came up
But some people still see him as the same lame fuck
His partners tryin to tell him to slow down
And he ain’t hearin em
But he been chillin since he been hangin roun with Miriam
But there's a menace that’s livin life in delirium
Hatin on him, they tryin to instill some fear in him
That nigga Womack had a thing for Mimi since Kojak was on tv
And that a known fact
Just like they know Stoney’s strap
Before this pepi lepew pole cats interceptin this
Boo is fittin to be blow back
And niggas really don’t really want that",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-meeting-of-the-minds-lyrics

If ya attitude pissy and ya gratitude iffy
Instead of rappin' too bitchy I would rather you diss me
You for play frontin' man you won't say nothin'
Look real gay or somethin' while you pushin' A's buttons
Someone shoulda told you, if you was the man
Then why you talkin' like a ho dude your mama need to hold you
I'll drop you with these vocals, yeah your papa need to scold you
I'll properly approach you and drama we can go through...
My mic handled like Kanobi gamble like Ginobili
The average night for 'sto D man I'll shine with trophies
You pantominin' and I'm linin' up your whole team
Lookin' like some dope fiends signin' up for codeine
Cocaine amphetamine qualude and anesthetic
Suicide in a letter contrived and synthetic
Nice with the rose plyers cold killer fo' hire
Go til your ho's wired chinchilla's on fire...
When we say high what? It's natural baby...
Lethal... slowly gettin' in there gettin' through to you
What this hip hop thang is about
You're listenin' to the sounds incredible S.O.M
Smooth.. put your antennae up...
So honor how the Souls do we bombin' on your whole crew
Insomniacs we don't snooze we dominate your Pro-Tools
Your broad be takin' photos with no clothes
For Ope only infatuated fascinated hold up - wait up
That's the natural vapor most doze
I activate the master mega ruckus when I blow holes
Through the Hollywood choke hold the plastic backwards
Manufactured no soul I won't go it's diabolic
Call it what you want...
Is it a gift?... is it a myth?...
Well if you don't know...
We'll be glad to clue you in...
Right about now...
Niggas know I'm official definitive rhyme inventor
I hit or supply the listener with vivid and vibrant visions
Givin' you guys the business is pimpin' in my dimension
You livin' in our dominion so give up that homage bitches
We masters at this mashin' who mastermind classics
Get past the rhyme basics 'fore you clash with my massive
With them asinine tactics tattered line patterns
Get splattered when I spat it, I let you maggots have it
Choose another angle...
Fuck around and knock the kangaroo up off your kangol
You fruity like a mango (fruity like a mango?)
Your crew be like a rainbow
You and me not the same bro see I be where you can't go...
I'm in the Winnebago twist the shit today go
Then rock the show get all the dough you probably can't relate though
Marijuana chain smoke wrangle mic's with Domino
We owners of the label your ho do me fellatio...
Man it's like that playa?
You better watch your baby... and that's no maybe
My homies have been sent by Hiero HQ to show y'all
Just how we bring it.. straight from the trainin' barracks
Upon further investigation...
We found this conclusive evidence
I turn pomegranite grenadine genitals for Genevive
Tennessee to Philippines grill her with the guillotine
Ink jet to think tank data link to beat break
Catalyst ability killer on a killin' spree
See Hiero drop a tune at times most opportune
No minds are stoppin' through to fire one off at you
Them live dum dub rounds to rile them up now
Live as fuck make sure the vibe don't come down...
Oh what might go down, must come up...
The fantastic four, the airborne rangers
No strangers to the arts of mic manipulation
And uncoverin' funky situations wherever they may be
You know where I stand on solid land

Swerving, spinning, wrecking, kinging, trying to shade eyes

Racing against the clock but left the cops at a standstill
Never crafted... epitaths in jail
I fell in love with using words a lot of niggas couldn't spell
Or scale, peel the stuff with the illest of ease
Paint soliloquies at atomic degrees
When you hoes was blowing girls double dutchin, we was trapeze-
Artisans, type extorting, leave your arch dive in seas?

So what you wanna be?

Just peep the bump and thump
You ain't got no choice but throw yo hands up

You're stuck
Crucified, you lose, don't try your luck
I cut 'em up
Run through and ruin MC's, they can suck my dick
The Hieroglyphic kingdom bring 'em down to earth
They worthless, worse, this is the beginning
And I'm winning
Offending MC's, they can't accept it
Inside he hide his fear or fury, that shit was weary
And I hear he don't be comin off the top
He better drop and give me 50
Cause if you don't shape up, I take what's mine, and that's your title
What you write I'll demolish
Polish up your skills, just forget all this
Call it quits, it's overwhelmin
You keep failin to impress
You're sluggish, I put a fake MC to rest
I got pages for the courageous, amazes
Fazes my opponent leave the microphone bent
Your flow is basic, you get erased quick
Stick to fantasizin
You're wack, deny the fact that I win
Ease the pain, I still remain the king
I sing a lullaby to nullify the lazy-ass lame famous MC
Even the nameless MC gets unfriendly

Why you got to do the kinda shit that I hate?
I find your shit to be fake

Gettin jocked when we tried to go
To these funk dictions
With a grudge written overnight rappers come wishin
But Plus hold the mic and slap you with the bumpshit'n
Them hoes jock you the most
Wish I was there when them cowards jumped Donnie and Los
We own all mics in the solar system
You gets dropped when the Souls come repossess props with the older wisdom
And the beat, it just drops, then I hold the rhythm
Souls of Mischief is the cold-est


To all you crews, think if we was weak as you
Well, would you listen to a doozy?
You're lucky that we disapprove
And frown at that candy-coated cartoon-clown shit
We don't allow it
(Naw, that would make us some hypocrites)
You scare yourself into poppin lip and jest
Suckers savin face but catch it in the chest
So just abate your haste
To activate your ( ? ? ) the best rhymer
Stomp your crew out with your bomber
I got the tool, just stay off the drama
Jump but that's madness, my shit's the bump
If I didn't have hits, I'd persist to pump
My mind to capacity till the shit just dump
Out on the sidewalk
And only then would I sqawk
And babble nonsense
Rippin this shit long as I'm conscious
And even in your dreams you fiend and follow it, no haps
You better quit 'fore y'all get with the vocab

Or somethin, lack the gumption
Get smacked when we up in the house

First of all niggas are fake, they get baked
Tryina penetrate the inferno
I surround the microphone with
Cause to the highest degrees MC's marvel over me
I never reconsider gettin rid of them
They perishin, embarassin as the air gets thin
I stare 'em in they eyes before I wear 'em in
It's no comparison to the immaculate
You get ramshackled with the mic
Lanced with the javelin for rattlin off at the lip
(Get off my dick)
Well you get liquified, stigmatized if you try
It's circumstantial
You niggas are unadvanced with the mic
An avalanche, you don't have a chance, just dance to
The beat, I'm notorious for this

Cause a  Miriam Stoney wanna kill him now
The child they woulda had ain’t livin now
Womack start to thinkin that he can get aroun
Since losin the battle he’s gettin wild
Went as far as kidnappin a nigga, wow
It’s somewhat absurd on somethin like words
Will fluster your nerves to blood on the curve
When suckers get served
The ruckus occurs
When someone gets hurt
Man fuck what you heard
Prez material
Miriam was merely a material witness to a cold serial killin
Barely alluded her own burial feelin
Stone had a feelin it was Womack
The feelin, won’t go back to prison
So he has a vision
There was no accidental friction between em
Kickin, screamin
Into a squeeze
Don’t squeeze
Hair triggerin easily
Pressed Stoney wearin a vest now
Stressed out 
Like a Vietnam vet
Outta the mind
Unborn child who would die
Consumes him with rage
Yes it’s 5o’clock
And you know it’s time for the traffic and weather together
Highway 580 was kinda shady
The gridlock has subsided
Sun’s out thoroughfare is free and clear
Even though it’s a nice day
It wasn’t a nice day for all
The young lady that was struck by a vehicle
Which witnesses described as a black truck survived
But lost her unborn child
What a horrible tragedy
I wanna know what you guys have to say out there
The phone lines are lightin up
Caller number one your on the air
Saudia from Oakland
Am I on the air
The city is gettin so bad
We all feel the same in the bay area
Thank you for the call
Next caller you're on
You know we got to come together as a people
You know, the man wants keep us separated
Thank you for the call
And we have time for one more
You know, I love my city
But I can’t keep my kids here nomore
Wow, that’s heartfelt
It’s gettin bad out here in Oakland
Police are overwhelmed
City is overwhelmed
It’s almost like we need some kinda super hero you know, arite
Obviously we not gonna get this resolved over the phone
But caller stay on the line, keep it right here
Keep it right here
We’ll be right back",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-the-synopsis-lyrics
Narrow Escape,There Is Only Now,2014.0,"Thinkin to myself while I light up the blend
While my people goin off screamin 911
When I called another
Had a ill vibe on the phone
A voice I never heard before
The man a ransom my O
Yow he spoke very slowly
Told me he was holdin my homie hostage
And we better not cross him
Incredibly toxic
You comin wrong and your head and get Glock clips empty
I simply listened and agreed to his conscious
For my brothers I plea so I’mma get up on my mission
Risky, we movin inconspicuous, swiftly
I know this hoe’s a mischief that’s with me
City illusion of freedom is beat deep in the white
From the we first start breathin
Harsh demons 
Even ya’ll start speak to police man if we 
Proceedin with the interweaving of plot
Becomin even more intriguin
As delinquents start overheating
The road is squeaking
And the motor’s leaking out
But kept the  increasin
As we got closer, reach the threshold
Hopin we don’t carry home a dead load
The angel on my shoulder echoed
We gettin stronger
Forget the dead load
Let’s go we need a jet boat
Head up the west coast
Awaitin patiently
Paces to keep awake
When they take a break to eat
And later bring a plate to me
I noticed, they changed the detail
Still a killer but maybe he can be 
This basement ain’t that deep
But if I listen close to how they  whole  lay out
And explain to me
One way out
Two doors connected by a short a doors
Sixteen step then a hard left
What sound like a chain linked fence
Barkin hounds
Might be sudden death
I can’t quite see what is next
But I’m a man of faith
And I believe in meeting faith head on
I’mma get off when they bring my plate
I don’t know what’s on the other side of that gate
But these cats they seem more desperate each passin day
And I know how money funny
So my buddies ain’t comin for me
Next time that door crack, whack I’mma off runnin
Look, as soon as we see Tajay we snatchin him
Ain’t nothin happenin
We pay no fuckin ransom
Leave em duckin and dancin
We made a few buck from rappin
Now they think we rich
So we trick em with stealth and swiftness
 by witness
What’s this
Before we get there we like shit yea
Tajay’s stubblin up out the bushes outta thin air
We pulled him to the van and sat him down and told him sit there
We took him to our doctor homie
So we know he’d get repaired
Nigga yea
But hold the bets
Cause this ain’t over yet
With no regrets
We gon show the threat how cold it gets
If you can’t 
Go and get more shit they ain’t know me yet
Revenge is even better when it’s cold as shit, nigga",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-narrow-escape-lyrics
Phoenix Rising (Resolution),"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000,"Resolution hinges on a breath after a series of struggles
When questions become less defining
And solutions have no silver lining
When the battle has fallen to ultimate destruction
With no momentary pauses for why it was all triggered
And from all angles equations plus views, you still can't figure
Resolution is the aftermath of that which could not be defined
Hanging on a cliff with no options but to die, rewind or recline
Compromising on earth to ignite what was written before you began
Understanding that every rock created, eventually turns to sand
Grandly accepting that in life's rythem, there is but one concrete plan
That has nothing to do with blocks, hoods, anger, tears, retaliation or man
Resolution is the fire in the sky left by a phoenix rising
A caged bird lost, but still free
Flying over a trecherous sea with no effort, gliding
Resolution is the thought you cannot contain
When city lights turn to magnificent heights
And release has no echo of pain
Resolution hinges on a breath that passes as quickly as an untangled life
Its when you... (deep breath, sigh)
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-phoenix-rising-resolution-lyrics
Danglin’,"Trilogy: Conflict, Climax, Resolution",2000,"Hey, yo, some niggas try to act like
Act like they crazy but they really fake
Fake shit they janky they shady say
He a lady rockin' a broad y'all
He could probably breed a baby

Ay, I done seen him lately
I don't know if you spot him
The type of cat that run his mouth and get you shot up
""Y'all,"" he ain't got no partners
He bust no slugs
Not even a BB gun if it's beef he run

You got caught now you breathin' from a machine
Cuz you sleepin' on how evil come back
It's like a scene from The Mack
The way you got pimp-slapped
Then ramshackled for your bundle
Late night on a track
And felt the crackle or the thunder
Your life snatched from right up under
Fool you trifle of a slumber
So eternally sleep
You wasn't learnt in the streets

You just squirm when they turn up the heat
Turnin' your sheets
Youse a geek
All obsessed with your d-boy image
Around real hitters a small joke
Tryin' to be down you get, broke
Stickin' your spokes
Trappin' your coke and still got, choked up
They play strip poker with ya spoke of tough luck
All for what? A fast buck

Hey, yo, some niggas try to act like
Act like they crazy but they really fake
Fake see they janky they shady
Me I can't relate to this imagery
Arrangin' and changin' (and changin') (and changin')
Rangin' from slangin' kilos
To gangbangin'
But we know your name and your people
You ain't tanglin'
You ain't from the set that you claimin'
You danglin'

Premeditatin' murder rate
Wet up off the sherminate
Shots hit your vertebrae
You wishin' you could turn the page
And start from the beginnin' back at chapter one
You was a virgin eighth grade
No collapsin' lung
Livin' free as the president now it's maximum
Security for you permanent the battle was won

Is so maddenin' to see you slip in
The same pattern and some escape
Many make the same dumb mistakes
Tryin' the hardest to be
Perceived as hard
Posted on the corners with the cheap cigars
Pants so baggy man you can barely keep 'em on
Speakin' on things you got no business speakin' on
But now keep keep it on
And be the first nigga we creep up on
Before you peep it you gone

Yeah, some niggas try to act like they crazy
They shady Barnum & Bailey
Clown Fugazis
You was a dweeb in the eighties
Thinkin' bulletproof now
But them real niggas are bangin'

Hey, this is what we tryin' to tell
Busters, suckers and tail tuckers
All frail hustlers and nail buffers
Leave it to the people that be it
Till you had seen it, but I seen it
Cats ain't breathin' when they leave you bleedin' on the cement
These phoney niggas make believe it
I hope a nine to your mind
Ain't what it take to free, hate to see

K-NOW Interlude II,There Is Only Now,2014.0,"We're back, with your latest update
And it's me, Ali, Shaheed, you know the rest
Giving you the know and the now and the how
So apparently, Miss Bonita fell in love with a square
That wasn't there to protect her
From a sucker MC that has beef with the chiefs of Oakland
And instead of getting hickeys
She's tasting Mickeys from this Midnight Marauder that's up to no good
You smell him?
And sometimes, it's good to jump in the mind of a female
But she's not all there to be aware of her reality
Or lack thereof in the moment
But while Womack pushes his agenda along
We'll keep it pushing
And keep you in the know, the now and the how
Because the streets run the show
And we're here because you should know",https://genius.com/Souls-of-mischief-k-now-interlude-ii-lyrics
K-NOW Outro,There Is Only Now,2014.0,"Yeah
Our Souls are in tact
Our Stoney is lonely
And Womack, well, he ain't coming back
You know
Where the wars wage
The rage of a mother's loss can turn a zero into a hero

Now on you can imagine this
Tajai:
It's mo', mo' deadly than a 64
The same m.o., I'll kill you slow
When you hear me for the first time
It's like you seen 5-0 with a trunk full of dope
You start to speak, choke like a ho doin' deep throat
Next thing you know your kickin' my raps instead of your own
Over your intrumental
Create your new style, can't even think to hit the beat like
Like that
'till you heard our sound on wax

Take a hit, I get into your brain like an opium stick
Feel it deep in your blood vessels
Experience the quickening, the light appears to be flickering
'cause I'm hitting you from every perspective
No weapons or projectiles
Just these style
Travel miles over all terrains
They got (? ? ? ? )
I make waves like jupiter, slam into earth
And the shit gets worse on the next verse
Chorus: we came to groove tonight, can't stop, won't stop
'till we move the mic (4x)

Steppin' to it's
Like touching a thermonuclear conduit
Enters my style, is the child charged
And be with so much potential
That you should not come close
Death is the unknown
And I'm not sure you ready to go
Opio:
Opio, each move I make has a strategy
Graphically describing scenarios like ken nordine
While you were snorting coke lines
I wrote lines thwarting all attempts to undermine hiero
Blind to nothin', all sting like professor x
Step in the circle it gets complex
No sustaining the lyrical hanging
Necks snap from the impact
Your world turns black from the rap
Tajai:
Yeah, but now it's time to speak my peace
To muthaphuckas who need more out of life than just jeeps
And freaks who find whatever in the dope ass speech
Havin' a smoke-out, freestylin'
With sirens right down the street
'cause it can't stop, won't stop like a hit and run
