I Need a Hot Girl,Guerrilla Warfare,1999.0,"You need a hot one I got one, I take and bend
Shake it down, break it down, with me and a friend
Biggity bounce, slide, ride, work that cat to the right
Push it down, push it up, boom you dynamite
Lick it up like ice cream, nigga you know
To make me bow bow bow bow (Rocky Balboa)
See I loving it when you thugging, baby just don't stop
You could wobledee wobledee (drop drop it like it's hot)
Beat it up and eat it up, love that's your dick
And if you ain't from the ghetto, then ride out bitch
Arms, legs, backs, and breast
You better read her fucking tats, nigga
""Mannie Fresh""
Suck it up and yuck it up, baby work on that pole
Got them niggas in a circle hollering here we go-o
Back that azz up yeah all the way to the zipper
I really love you hot girl but I got to flip her

Give my ho 10 G's, told her spend the shit
See my hot girl ride Lexus Coupe, bitch
And she got the matchin Roley, ho, floss your shit
And she got the matching mink for the winter bitch
See a real hot girl can't be faded bitch
Roll the dice, hit the sev', no crap no bitch
Got the brand new Rover out the showroom quick
Customized TV's all through that bitch
Yokahama 20-inch dubs on that bitch
See my Cash Money hot girl floss her shit
Ridin Uptown bumping Hot Boys ya bitch
And that blue faced Rolex I bought that bitch
Keep big head Benjamins on through her shit
Fuck a ""Thug Girl"", them hoes can come and suck my dick

Where my bitch at? Look, a hot girl is a silent ho
If a bitch get outta line she a violent ho
Ain't no pest, far from being a whining ho
Fuck up she confess, she ain't no lying ho
That's what I need, a hot girl is a jazzy bitch
I'd take her any day for a classy bitch
On the down low for her nigga she a nasty bitch
I tell her touch it, she gonna reach down and grab the dick
I bust a nut, it's soft, she get it back hard
The police kick in the door she take the charge
If a nigga go to jail she run for a nigga
Money orders, business, and go run for a nigga
She be a nigga balling, would get bout it for her nigga
Lemme come thorugh, hit the stash, and walk up by the nigga
I can't see no other bitch for the B.G
But a hot girl fo' sho' call her a H.G., a hot girl

(What you need boy?)
I need a hot girl
(What you want boy?)
I want a hot girl
(What you need boy?)
I need a hot girl
(What you want boy?)
I want a hot girl

I like 'em hot, the ones that don't tell me to stop
Eat dick swallow the cum, and they know how to pop
I need a project bitch, a hoodrat bitch
One that don't give a fuck and say she took that dick

She a doggy with it, she gonna wobbledee
Then she know I'm d want it with it
Open her legs and squeeze a nigga
Like she want me in it
Now turn around and back it up
Then throw it at a nigga
Until I say, ""Ohh that's enough""

Give me a gangsta ho, one that don't give a fuck
And that'll shank a ho
The one that'll slang still, and keep it on the low
One that'll do time for me, and say fuck the po'
To all you know

A lil' shorty in the twat have it hurting and thumping
They be like, ""They say he small girl but he workin with something""
I'm the Wayne on fire I'll smash on your boo before a hot girl bang
What's happening with you?

I need a hot girl
(What you want boy?)
I want a hot girl

Tuesday and Thursday,Guerrilla Warfare,1999.0,"Two of the hottest days of the week
They harassing and hacking niggas in that UPT
N.O.P.D. be rolling so deep
They be fucking over niggas
Kicking in doors
Sometimes, they be pulling triggers
Ya hustling? Better chill out
Cause they not for joking
Making sure they close shop
All day, they gon be smoking
So I advise you just to stay inside
If they catch you down back, for sure you taking that ride
Downtown, rilla
Where niggas doing time, be waiting
Better be bout your issues
For your ass they gon be chasing
And every man for theyself in that pen
So if ya all in nigga, ya all in
For help, ain't there nigga, ain't no calling
So if ya got a chance, run when ya hear that siren
Tuesday and Thursdays, they gon be riding
Stay ducked off cause it's safer when ya hiding
And they don't give a fuck what shape and sizing
Lock you down, prison rate steady rising

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you better watch for the sweep
Look, them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street

Shit, nigga better hop, skip, and jump from the block
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, better run from the block
Stay there if you want and get stumped from a cop
Knowing them white folks, you might get hung from a cot
Look, look, look, look, look
Nigga better run
If u got some dope or too much cake or a gun
Looking for some freedom, find that you will get none
And damn, I ain't even much see my P.O. last month
I'mma play the hotel
I missed my court date -- I ain't trying to end up in jail
I'mma put up some mail in case I have to make bail
I'mma still rhyme swell
Shit, you might as well
And stay from the block cause it be hotter then hell
I'mma tell ya now, they don't give a damn about ya
End up in that place and fool around and be forgotten
They rotten like a whole apple off a forbidden tree
On Tuesdays and Thursdays you won't find me


ATF be showing they ass around my block
Feds get all the respect cause they close shop
Who do you think be pushing them birds up in the hood?
Who do you think be dumping them bodies up in the wood?
It's something like baseball, three strikes and you ride
Violate your probation, two and a half on five
My pride don't want me to be up in this place
My pride don't want the law to notice my face
A young nigga with golds behind tints on dubs
And the paper license plates, they gon think I'm a thug
They gon tear this motherfucker up looking for drugs
And make them dogs break me off, trying to get me to talk
You wouldn't believe the shit with the police I done been through
I done seen some shit they did to people I'm kin to
My friends too
That's why I be chilling, ya heard me?
Up in my fucking residence on Tuesdays and Thursdays


Certain days lil B. Geezy hit the block and hang
Two days out the week I lay low cause them people gon swang
I ain't bout getting hacked
You know that ain't my thang
Police riding my back
Scoping out my rang
I play it smart -- I ain't stupid, I know when to leave the block
I know how to peep the scene
I know when it's hot
Oh them jumpout boys, they'll take your loot
Tuesdays and Thursdays, them big white boys have a nigga spooked
They be three deep, creeping
Coming round the corner, peeping and sweeping
But they ain't gonna catch me slipping, I'm rolling out
I'm gon chill by a bitch and cool out on the couch
Smoke blunt after blunt till I pass out
When it get dark and cool off then I'mma smash out
I respect the task force -- they don't give a fuck
For anything, they'll have ya in central lock up
On Tuesdays and Thursdays

 Whoa, now there you have it. Tuesdays and Thursdays
(off the heezy). The whole task force for yo' ass
(nigga just giving ya some game, ya dig?) For sho
 Them white folks don't wanna see a nigga ball
They wanna see us crawl, bruh
 For sho', lookee here
On Mondays, you can run all day
On Tuesdays, sit ya ass down (duck out playboy)
On Wednesdays, you can slang all day
On Thursdays, sit ya ass back down (off top!)
On Fridays, you can fuck all day
On Saturdays and Sundays, you cool boy, believe that
 You can take this for what it's worth, playboy. And don't use ya brain
And take heed to what CMB be saying. Fuck around and be in that cage like a
Ol dog. Treating a nigga like a puppet. Taking orders like a bitch. But a
Nigga gotta use that game and stay up and try to stay rich man",https://genius.com/Hot-boys-tuesday-and-thursday-lyrics
Too Hot,Guerrilla Warfare,1999.0,"I duck off, cause the law
Lookin for B.G

So I flipped the script now I'm in a ES three
Playin by different bitches cuz my face in the paper
Hoe drove by fore' she could describe me, I got the eraser
I don't discriminate I flip a bitch too
She got to be eleminated I kill a bitch too
She her hair fixed by my sister she lost she gonna get her
To let me drop her off by this nigga
Off the river
She ridin with me thinkin that it's cool and shit
She dont think I know that she let her lips loose and shit
I'm gonna pull over pull her out and pop some slugs in the bitch
And leave her pussy stinkin cuz I dont love a bitch
But I was taught comin up, never trust a bitch
And don't hesitate for a minute to chug the bitch
She was tryin to get me locked up
It was a must that the ho get popped up
Fuckin with me best believe that I'll cool ya block
Got ya sayin them Hot Boy niggas too too hot
Too too hot

What do ya call a nigga that be duckin the law? ( Hot Hot)
What do ya call a nigga that be playin it raw(Hot Hot)

Lil One killed that boy in November
Lil One be hustlin

Lil One kind of remind me of me

Hot Boys ridin our flames firing (Ride, Ride, Ride)

I'm bout to make a move so you best to 86
Cause I be coming through
With shit that be seperating bricks
You got a broken tool then you better get it fixed
And ain't no missin you cause I got too many clips
Hey then then too many times I gotta straighten the cross
Them niggas was trying but I was breaking 'em off
If you had it on your mind I was taking it off
Either get up and whine or break to the north
Look whoa there there go your cut you better catch it
Your last minute is coming up you better strectch it
Oh you got dope in the trunk almost forgot to check it
Right after your head bust I expect to exit
I'm a punch you when you're out and unlock it, I got this
Grab a steering wheel column and pop it, we're shoppers
I'm about to go and kill for they profit, my pockets
Him, me, and that nigga bout to stop it
Why not bitch
Chorus:
Grab your strap saddle up nigga when you ride with me
You ain't guaranteed to make it back when you ride with me
And what I ride like a roller coaster
When I ride with uptown soldiers
Look here we ridin we ridin
We coming up out the flames with the K firing
We ridin We ridin
We coming up out the flames with the K firing

Me and my boy Lil' Wayne rolling
Strapped up in black clothes ain't no ass-holing
Up in the bubble lye black tints ducked off
Head busting BG straight gotta play the game raw
Now look here nigga better be gone
Off the block cause mother fuckers be falling
Cause Off top I'm gone get my mother fucking creep on
Nigga get chopped like the leaf offf a tree holmes
I'm a flee off the scene with my rees(reeboks) on
Black thicker shirt and my GB's on
Run with me ain't no way you could get your sleep on
Cause when I come ooh ooh it's hot the heat's on
I know you feel it nigga
It's pure ruckus when I enter
I sent a message letting you know I spin ya
Been bro shooting
50 plus behind air T retaliation is a must
Hollows get bust brain get bust
Anybody here here
When I'm full of that shit
And I'm on a mision to split it get split
Peep me I play for keeps I kill 'em all
No deciding
I take no prisoners from em all when I'm ridin
Chorus

Uh I come to leave a nigga smelly
Full black better get ready with my M-elevy (Mack Eleven)
Up in my 98 Chevy I swing corners
Cut you up like w belly with that thing on ya
Now it be me (uh huh)
And I be Wayne (uh huh)
This little clique like a chain to your brain (uh huh)
I shoot first for my talking
Rougher than a carpet
Heard about Hot Boys erase your name up off the market
And nigga break a swell fly
Camouflage up out of the sky
What if I buy you die
Look I spin corners like a daily routine
The bad choppers told a nigga I be 17
I got a 10 shot Glock
Inched back then I pull it
I'm coming round your spot with a sack full of bullets
I be twisting round your block in all black nigga
Full of that style don't move I day act nigga
Find where you at and then I ch-chop nigga
I'm on a duck plan with about 50 shots nigga
Now whoa what saying to Shite
My 9 be about that
Watch it (crack) crack and I'm riding

Ride around with the 2 shooter
Ain't gone help ya
Playing round with the 50 shooter
Scalp you like a scalper
10 percent gone help ya
90 percent gone fail ya
Vests can't protect what I bring best
Believe it's gone fail ya
4 deep in a Navigator on a creep
Windows tinted black on black in leather seats
Hot Boys with hot girls ready for beef
Red dot plot 32 shot bodies in heat
Desert Eagle with hollows
You got nothing but egos
Putting hands to niggas that's at Evil Kanieval
Playa haters like shit, get assed out
With no doubt blood blood rush out like a water spout
LD niggas best believe they be ridin with me
Shot L tuck best believe he be ridin with me
With them guerillas should have left the meat where it was
But no he wants to spark the shit up

Respect My Mind,Guerrilla Warfare,1999.0,"What
Check, check
Head buster, set ripper
Neighborhood superstar
Corner splitter
While we dispose of
Nigga broad hitter
Hot Boys soldier
Expedition flipper, hell
Niggas be terrified from us cause they know how we play
Them niggas hide from us or catch 3 from a K
I'm just a scrub, I can't scuff; I'm too light to fight
I'm lil' too thin to win so I ride at night
You're fake, respect, nigga
You're playin' with the wrong one
I'll break your neck, nigga
You're playin' with the wrong gun
I use K's to wet niggas
I'm sprayin' the whole room
Better watch your back, nigga
Lil' one, that's a wrap
March nigga step up when I.. I bust a cap
Niggas drop like (whistle) splat
Keep jokin' here, and I'm gon' show you what I'm 'bout
Respect my mind or get your brains knocked out
(Chorus)
Respect my mind or get your brains knocked out
Respect my mind or have them boys in your house
Respect my mind, look, we be ridin' on chrome
Respect my mind cause we get our shine on
Respect my mind cause we that Hot Boy clique
Respect my mind, nigga, you can't phase this
Respect my mind, look, we'll fuck your bitch
Respect my mind, look, we 'bout that gangsta shit

Nigga, watch me grow up
When I was small he had plan
My daddy was ballin', and he was the right-hand man
My poppa bought us a house to keep our family secure
Livin' good on a ranch in the middle of the woods
I understood at a young age my poppa would spray
Seen him slit a nigga throat and shoot one up in the face
He'd be murder case after case: he was untouchable
But he had a right-hand man that wasn't trustable
Who undercover slow he made deals under the table
Workin' for the Feds 'round my people wearin' a cable
My daddy got busted, so he got left with the dope
All our shit got repossessed, and our family was flat broke
Moved back inside the projects in summer of '84
Developed my hustlin' skills from Yomey and Black Zo
When I got to the point that I wasn't small no more
Hooked up the same nigga that handled my daddy dough
I know that he sheisty; but this nigga just don't know
Swear to God I ain't 'bout it; but this nigga just don't know
I got a few under my belt and I'mma make it one more
Cock the 4-4 and knock his brains out on the floor
Respect my mind
(Chorus)

Me, Wayne, Turk, and Juvenile gettin' blunted
In Fresh pearl-white Suburb 1500
No stun'n, countin' 100 thou', nigga fronted a brick
He should have knew Hot Boys wasn't bringin' back shit
That's how the game go, and that's how the game get played
Head buster, for sure, sweat no hoes, haters get sprayed
All week long, look, I'm a nigga on the grind
All year round I make you niggas respect my mind
Every single day it's a must I tote that fuckin' iron
Disconnect your spine, leave you funky or paralyzed
I blues blocks to bust heads
I use Glocks and play hotels to the Feds
Niggas know I ain't the one to be repped on
Move when I'm comin' through, or you get stepped on
I don't give a motherfuck if you got your vest on
I'm shootin' through that, thought you knew that
That's how B.Geezy do that
I ride dirty, and when I ride you die
All the time you bitch-niggas gon' respect my mind
(Chorus)

Nigga, respect my mind
Can't, then stay your distance
Kill realahs like that, nigga, you come up missin'
I soak your spot when you're repping on me
Get hit with shots when you're hatin' on me
What's happenin', wodie
Do you think you ready for us
Disrespect our mind, fuckin' over you is a must
Come through your cut
Nigga, it's over, don't spook now
Cause when you was talkin' 'bout us it was all good, ha
Nigga. fuck all that; I ain't gon' talk, I'mma save it
Original H.B., nigga, I ride Mercedes
A young rich nigga, my whole team playin' with figures
Wear soldiers and 'Bauds, and gettin' richer and richer
I got stacks of money, and fuckin' plenty hoes
Nigga, respect my mind or I'll knock off your nose

How you gone shine, dark or bright
Cus these hoes be wishin' to ride in a '97 Expedition
When I pass I make 'em stop look and listen
For tryin' ta follow, the big body Impala
Don't love 'em, don't need 'em, bitch sorry can't holla

Now tell me what kinda
Nigga got diamonds that'll *bling* blind ya
I'm only 14 I'm a Big Tymer
I'm sittin' on chrome, all week shiner
My 'bauds hang low, crystal on the flo'
I'mma flex, twenty thousand dollar Rolex
I got my name on a street up in every city
And look everywhere I be I got a mirror with me
Look I'm feared by many, loved by broads
I'm living marvelous, I'm a superstar (superstar)

All kinds of cars
Neighborhood superstars
Feared by many and loved by broads

Dirty World,Get It How U Live!!,1997.0,"It's a dirty world but it still spins
Ya can't do nothin' about it but try to live in it
You can't live too large
Or live too small
It's a fix, but 2-2-6 gone still ball

No matter what, them people gonna always watch us
And them dirty judges gonna
Keep on tryin' to knock us
Playa haters everwhere, can't trust ya own peeps
And the feds got us with
This new thing called conspiracy
Them dirty scamps throwin' crosses, real niggas dyin'
They put a limit to our flossin', don't wanna see us shine
But close ya eyes, lil' hater, and look the other way
This for my mother, 
lost my father just the other day
I'm seein' niggas get shot up, hell I got shot, too
Man, you hate me and I hate you, look what this world do
I'm watchin' my own people fry and see they brains boil
Look I don't curse but in this verse nigga fuck the world
Chorus 2x

Niggas be wantin' to kill ya, when ya on top they tryin to still ya
Surrounded by playa haters, how you gonna make a million?
Own boys be tryin' to take ya spot, you think it's cool but it's not
Niggas be tryin to plot on what ya got
If you rich you better leave it low
It's a dirty old world, nigga, if you didn't know
Don't tell ya business to hoes cuz they'll cross you up
Tell they old man you got her, he'll try to chop you up
Watch ya back at all times, it's a dirty world
Niggas get left and found over boy and girl
Fuck playin' the game raw, I play it smart nigga
Think I'm gonna get caughtup nigga? I won't nigga
I keep my eyes wide, and don't trust no nigga or bitch
These days, nigga, ya can't trust ya own clique
Ain't that some shit? This world nothin' nice
Niggas hatin' if you got it, it's all gravy when ya trife
Chorus 2x

Them bitches got a nigga trapped, they ain't givin' a shit
But they'll give it to them Japs, they buy property and don't even pay no tax
Ride nothin' but Lexus' and 'Lacs
The same treatment we ask, a destination of blacks
Give us a ballot of names, and expect us to vote
The way I see it, we losin'out anyway this shit go
Show me a politician and I'll show you a crook
Show me a police officer that go by the book
They'll plant dope on ya, go to court on ya
Give ya 99 years and slam the door on ya
Angola, the free man bout it, he don't play
Nigga get outta line, ship 'em to Camp J
Food stamps and welfare done been cut now
They done fucked the Medi-care up, so niggas stuck now
Bet ya before the week out another nigga get killed
Bet ya Pennington don't give a fuck how a nigga feel
We fallin' like bricks, and they flyin' like birdies
This world needs to take a bath cuz it's too dirty
Chorus 2 ½ x

Ya know this world so dirty, believe it ain't clean at all
I gotta be a 'lil man and stand tall
Y'all niggas jackin' for they habit, they can't keep it up
F*ck with the wrong nigga's shit, you get ya head bust
I only trust niggas that I know down with me
I see straight through
Cut-throat niggas easily
They tryin' to snatch me, cuz they know I'm what ya
Used to be
Cuz I'm a major fu-uh-factor to C-M-B
But I keep a chopper
That's damn near as big as me
Cuz I refuse to let any nigga still me
That'll be stripes for a nigga on the fuckin' streets
Reppin' off me sayin' they shot the B.G
I get some weed and just roll up
This world tore up, niggas on that dope, sick, fold up
My clique rich wrapped in diamonds and pearls
Ya gotta be strapped, bein' rich in this dirty world",https://genius.com/Hot-boys-dirty-world-lyrics

Rock Ice,Blue Streak: The Album ,UnKnown,"When it comes down to stuntin', I pull it all
When it comes down to G shit, I pull it raw
When it come to pullin' hot girls, I pull 'em all
When it come to rockin' ice, B.G. rock it all
Sport diamonds like I tote a tech
Baby tote a fo' nickel like he wrappin' gifts
Try to stay cool so I don't melt the diamonds 'round my neck
I keep bustas in suspense of what I'mma do next, gotta respect
I ain't out to please a bitch
She could get on her knees
I'm tryin' to get rich
I'm shined out, ten karats on my wrist
Flyin' first class, me and my whole click, now
Fuck a glass, we sip Dom P straight out the bottle
Never I play, you know I'm 'bout murderin'
I ain't gotta say it
You don't cross me, I don't cross you
But understand a Hot Boy gotta floss too
Look, I'm iced out

1 - I rock ice (lil' daddy)
Everytime I step
I rock ice (lil' momma)
Cuz I love the rep
I rock ice (whole world)
Cuz I'm doin' my thang
I rock ice
Bling bling, bling bling

My Rolex crushed out, my chrome stay spinnin'
Hot Boy wit so much money, I don't know how to spend it
Don't you wish you could be in my shoes just for a minute
Carry nothin' but faces, never quarters and pennies
I started at nothin', look at me now, I'm iced out
Police think I'm doin' wrong, but nope, I'm right now
It's cuz I'm Black, huh, that you ridin' my back
Paper on everything I have, so how you love that
They don't wanna see me ballin', wanna see me fallin'
Got it locked off wit my tank against the wallin'
I floss but get dirty too
My Roley cost, try to take it and I'll murder you
Ya say I stunt too much
I can't help it, I be with baby
The number one stunter who drive these girls crazy
The one with the 32 platts in his mouth
Two Roleys on his wrist, game spitta from the south
Tell me, what kinda nigga rock ice that'll hit ya momma (momma)


It's Cash Money youngest nigga
Right around ten figgas
That's what I (uh) work with
Pockets are (uh) perkin'
Money is my purpose
Whatever I purchase
Oh, could you do better?
Rollin' with the bezel
Who that be, that's Wayne
Look at his gold chain
Sometimes I wear grey
White diamonds, pear shaped
My jewelry just pure awful
And I can't stop thuggin', it's just in my culture
It's a must, everyday I'mma shine, black
You wan' meet me?
You just might need contacts
Cuz I'm the little one with the ice, flossing
Please, playa hater, get your wife off me
I ride by in a Jag with the top low
Throwin' hundreds, but it's cool, cuz I got more
Me and my niggas, we stunt like there's no tomorrow
Big Tymers, Hot Boys
Nigga CMR, nigga CMR


Now you boys now them 4 99's I got expired
All them bitches plushed out on 20 inch tires
I'm lookin' for some hell of a head, is you for hire?
You lookin' at this Roley I got, don't you adire
The way a nigga lay a stunt
Braggin' 'bout 20 inch rims, up in the restaurant
But it ain't over, I'm about to go to Disneyland
Yo, you fuckin' deaf now, ya understand?
What if my baby momma's ride by, lookin good
I gave 'em both a hundred G's to get them out the hood
My momma gettin' chauffeured like a movie star
She don't know a damn thing about drivin' a car
I'm rimmed up
Now peep this million dollar smile in my mouth
And all this luxury shit I got in my house
I done sold a million records and I'm still goin'
Don't ask about my watch and my chain, it's still gone",https://genius.com/Hot-boys-rock-ice-lyrics

See I be ridin' on the block in the lex bubble
Ready to come out the trunk and make yo chest buckle
When I come I lay the sprays wit K's by the truck load
Should've got out of my way you heard my clip shuffle
Now yall was on the block with shot gunz
But when I finished, made it look like yall had pop gunz
Dressed in black...Long hair...Long gaks...Lights off no stun'n
Pack to the back, no mask, I'm thuggin'
(What!)What u wan' do, if yo ribs start bussin
Then 20 mo' nigga's follow in hummer's, so ain't nothin'
(Look!)
17 ward is where I grew up at
So where a busta nigga standin is where he blew up at
I blew up that CMB so respect my peeps
Or else you want yo life to be all over the streets
Now watch me the younger soldier bring u closer to death
A little more than you expect nigga...I clear da set

You know they say Lil Wayne dem hotboy he will bust dem heads
Him calls on his gun and all dem bloody bodies dead
Dem...dem...really shouldn't try Lil Wayne cuz he will play with K's
And will bust a nigga wide open and put his brain on his plate
Now watch a nigga neighborhood (phhhh!!!) go up in flames
They...They all got burnt, couldn't can't stand the heat
I bet none of them (?) jackers ain't gone test Lil Wayne
Cuz I...I clear the set messin' wit' me

But u might think I'm wrong
But if u play with me and my click, you'll blow up like a bomb
I...I upset yo home
Throw slugz at yo dome
Just gimme the word and I shine the chrome braid my hair and its on
Yall lil boys shouldn't come against the uptown assasin
Jump out quick out of the jag and blow fire like a dragon
Soulja bandana wit' bannana clips to fit in my sweeper
Once I hit the set look everybody burns like a heater


Now hold up as I bust back, watch playboy
Keep a dub sack, hey boy
Come to irritate yo day, boy
Watch yo chest seperate, boy
When I cocks me gloc me done tossed dem buck shots
And done kill them blood Clots....What the deal

I'm use to be set in that water wit my still flippin'
I'm pistol grippin'...ridin wit my grill glisten

Now catch me in the black truck with chrome wheels twistin'
A lil tipsy he gone lie, talkin' bout he gone kill yo Ms.'s

If the nigga wan' play I turn batter to flour
So nigga clear the set and bout 5 after the hour

I don't want for nothin, livin the million dollar dream
All of a sudden, niggas wanna do me in
Don't make me get disgusted, or over your head is 10
Me and Baby shinin, on 750 C.B.R.'s
Going to the best western with niggas in two cars
Tomorrow hoes gotta go, cause me and B flyin back to Tennessee
Tryin to see bout some cheese
They got niggas ballin, but they don't even wanna
Get out the projects, and buy a house on Washatona
Fresh gotta Burben, pearl white with T.V.'s
My clique ain't hurtin, haul to the bank First N.B.C
Juve gotta a Beamer, blue and black with 17's
B Expedition shoppin, he just ordered 23's
It's all gravy, this life I'm livin, I'm lovin
Young, straight thuggin, watch out for my clique cause we com'n

Drop everything where you stand nigga
Give it all up, like a man nigga
You workin with somethin, nigga bring me to the house

I come for the cheese, 25 G's, remain on your knees
Or i'll be forced to release, freeze

Went from captain Save-A-Ho, to Captain Kirk, to Captain Kangaroo
But you ain't got no army captain, so who is you a danger to
Nobody hang with you, slang with you, bang with you
Spend change with you, or do no kind of gangsta thangs with you
I'm on your heels, and ain't no lettin up
So if you hit the ground, bitch ain't no gettin up
Niggas start the bettin up
Put your last dime on me, your credit line on me
Ask Niggy D.D., you gon win every time on me
That ain't no lyin on me, that's on my momma

Know that they gonna put it off till they get it
I had a bad bitch with big ass, until she was top of the line
So she stayed in Chanell fits
She ran with some made niggas, so she was a made bitch
However you wanna do it, it's all on you how she played it

Boys at War,Guerrilla Warfare,1999.0,"(Lil' Wayne)
Guerilla.....what!!!..what!!!....untamed guerilla
(Juvenile)
Everyday I hear somebody bustin' choppers
They be makin' it hot, they be killin' my block
They be havin' them whole old people scared up
They be havin' them lil' children scared duckin'
But they don't give a fuck
They wanna see whats up
Niggas done play wit' his people Now they gone bust'em up
Some of them snortin' dope, some of them bag that kill
Some of them jus bout that foolishness some of them play it evil
I remember the club, they got banged up
Nigga was in the middle of it wit' his brains bust
And his partner saw, all of them niggas face
And now they wanna turn the tomorrow into a murder case
Nigga get out of jail, he still be up in beef
Gotta get some money, gotta get him a piece
Gotta get him a low so he can beef up
Catch a nigga down bad and woedy gettin' stuck
(Chorus)

Niaggas are taggin', they backin' up, they let'em hang
My niggas walkin' up, pullin' up, fuck a drive by
Cuz the nigga on the passenger side automatically die
Capable to slide, wit' a U-P-T
You out of bound, you ain't from uptown, cross Martin Luther King
Its pistol play on up and up
Niggas being big mouthed so they gettin tossed up
You better be about yo business cuz its going down
Niggas gettin' out, two weeks later they body found
I can't be fuckin' with them niggas drawin' beef to me
Have me in shoot outs that don't concern the B.G
I play it like the next nigga fuck he play it raw
But I gotta watch my fuckin' ass cuz dem boys at war
Dem boys at war

Spittin(?) mac 10, grenedes blowin shit up
Troopers be on roofs wit' scopes shootin shit up
Head shots what they givin' no surrenderin' you never die
Spin in da bed, in the rover wit' the six tires
Cuttin' throats leave'em hangin' like ropes
Dead bodies is what you find, niggas be dying slow

Stick & Move,Let ’Em Burn,2003.0,"I don't have all day to be chillin'
Just talkin' shit
You done got me out here now
I'm tryin' to get off this brick
I don't trust you to be up in your spot
Niggas'll blitz
These faces ain't familiar right now
I'm 'bout to split
Look, if you really want 'em
They going for 17
Other than that
I'm dropping 'em off in the mail for me
Nigga hit me on my hip
Back to back
Gotta make a St. Rose run
Cause lil' one say he got five stacks
Rush hour is the best time
To hustle for me
I hit the I-10
Blowin', pickin' up in the east
Droughts hit
But you gotta keep your ears to this street shit
Exchangin' numbers with niggas
To see what's the sweet-test deal
If it ain't
I'm chalk it up as a loss
Forever lookin' for the best shit
At minimum cost
I move around like some ants in my pants
Networkin'
You ain't got what I'm lookin' for
I'm movin' on to the next ones

These niggas heads be bangin'
Motherfucker dropped the dime
And told the feds be slangin'
Can't tell 'em what they don't know
Like it don't show
And if I lay low
A lotta niggas won't sco'
I'm waitin' now
I gotta a lotta niggas on post
For dope and coke
And a lotta niggas want both
Get on my cheddar route
I'm bout to flood it out
Get me a 30 day run
Switch to another house
And leave the last one
For the Feds to investigate it
I need another 30 days
Francesca made it

Your third time in front that man
So it ain't no love

The messy hoes talkin'
The dope fiends walkin'
The fucking law's stalkin'

Cousin, we gotta breathe
And in the hood
We gotta lotta needs
You feel me nigga?
So, in the mean
While I be showerin'

Issue out cocaine like scholarships

Spit ’n Game,Get It How U Live!!,1997.0,"Fresh, Slim, Baby, Hot Boys
Hot Boys in this bitch
Check it out

Niggas steady getting chopped
Losin they life behind stupid shit
Ain't that a bitch
Niggas, gettin' they wig split
And it's a shame
Killin' has became a fame
I cannot see my brains layin
On the ground
I keep my 9 on my waistline
Chop 'em down
Picks up the shells to leave no evidence around
And, it's t-shirt land
When niggas ain't playin'
Got a chrome Glock got it cocked
Red dot on yo' knot
As I pop
Nonstop
Till you drop
Pronounced dead
On the spot
It's a tragedy when I spin' yo fuckin' block
A nigga, from BlackConnect
Will leave ya wet
Fa' sho yo' face is on the next
If ya disrespect
I ain't fakin' it, yo' life I'm takin' it
Hollow points bullets racin' it
Niggas ain't makin' it
When I bust
Tell it to any nigga chopper bullets you can't trust
If you bust, when I spray
Head for shelter
10% is gonna help ya, 90 is gonna fail ya
A lot of punk niggas try to play hard
Put yo' face on a fresh tee sendin' that ass to the morgue
Better be cool if you don't, that's all on you

16 worth a mill my whole clique push dope
Transportin' ki's in the all black Camero
50 G's on the seat, layin' next to my heat
I'm a Hot Boy to the police
And I'm a thug on the street
Yeah I score from Slim and B
10 a ki, real OG's, 36 oz's formed the halves
Goin' for 2 G's
UPT connect, bout stackin', leave ya wet
Niggas who disrespect, my chopper put in check
Big body on broaders, that's all I know
Mansion on Washetona 6 figures on the floor
Double R and DR watched by Uptown security guards
10 G's a ki, 36 o's a piece
4 and a half, 2 G's, but I'll take 18
Got some niggas on my team bout head bussin' and green
Flippin' hundreds to G's, hoopties, to benzies
I get my ki's, from my uncle KC
He's a Magnolia soldier
Did in 10 in Angola
Shoot out in that 'Nolia
Knock ya head off ya shoulders

I ain't about no playin
When I'm comin' get out the way
Gun play, bussin' a nigga ass on the runway
Head straight back to the hot block
Flight in a half
Look if I'm out there bad I might cut you in half
UTP tatooed it, across my stomach stay booted
Look I'm a looter, holdin' the Ruger
Or a 6 shooter
On Tuesdays and Thursdays
You better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
I'm layin off in some room by my bitch duckin' them people
Staked out the area, and rob the chinese store
Do it like it's legal, I heard heads in power
Bitches want the dope dick children and cop blockers
Niggas in the cut with ski masks lookin' for me
I'm on top of the roof with a chopper watchin' em too
Fuck with me your mans urge get in his curtains
Now send ya people
To the TC and we gon' hurt 'em
I'm seein' niggas
Shootin dice, bettin heavy on 4's and 10's
I'm in the Chevy with B.G. and our girlfriends
Park 'round the corner leave it runnin, creep slow
Look bitch this ain't the night show, lay it down hoe
Ya think I'm playin, ask Baby and Slim how I can
Hook me up I don't have time for no games
Look here I stompin in this bitch
I'm chompin' a new fit
I'm bound to snatch a hoe and make her monkey on this dick
Look at what ya facin partner
A whole nation
Of niggas that's mind damaged
Out here paper chasin'
With that iron I'ma roll wit em
Mama don't pray for me I don't back down from no nigga
They got a place for me

See I want millions, hundreds and big thousands
Tryin' to rain clout and third ward public housin'
Uptown streets is where all my ends meet
Give me 9 9 G tryin' to see my destiny
I do it all to ball drop the phone if I call
See I'm livin' real large eventhough I'm real small
But don't let that fool ya
Money rules everything around me
Creepin up silent behind ya that's where ya find me
I ain't hear for a lil
I want the whole damn spot
I cock my Glock and have ya plot so I turn out to the top
Nigga be runnin' with money
Things you doin' I done done it
9 9 point 5 mil big deals keep it comin
Slugs hummin' chopper gunning catch the vapor from the laser
Infrared fled big bread money maker
Pop a slug barrell shaker for big paper
Big ballin' life taker for big caker
Ben Franklin, bank televancin' big bankin
Buster gankin', left stankin' ship sankin'
Ain't no such thing like see another nigga come up
But if I don't know that other nigga, then his come up is my stuff
Call it a bluff if you want, but come and test for ya own
See how quick model homes leave home and fell a dome
Roam to the top, slip up and get buck
Get out my way, fo' I spray
I'm tryin' to live up

Young thugger, baby gangsta
Thug or get popped
Off top
Aim my pistol straight for head shots
I release the safety, if ya chase me
Best waste me
Don't hunt bitch down in ya way
Or ya make me
Reverse the game and wax that ass
Stop you from playin'
I clear yo block on that ass
Nigga wonder why I stress
Uptowns the place
It's the best
We got weapons that'll go through ya vest
Get left wet
Disrespect it's beef fo sho
Got back up, from the Mac Melph Calio
You got coke, and don't wanna go broke

Cuz around me bitch I'm doin bad ya can't sell it

If I jack you I don't want half I want all
Stand tall for mine

My skills outstandin'
Kill or be killed
Niggas out to give me the blues
Let 'em kill me, I refuse
I'm down for killing
But the one of  I was accused

Gangsta Nigga,Let ’Em Burn,2003.0,"Holla at me nigga you know it be Weezy ""The Don""
I murder easy but hard to kill like Steven Segal
Its paper, pussy, and pistols - pass love to the pimp
I'm clutching a M busting that tip for fucking with him
I'm stuck with the hustle, smuggling whatever for the cheddar
Tucking the metal don't play and I'll get fucked if I let em
I gotta ride til I resign its Squad or die
And any coward try its homicide
We got Glocks and stuff, got federal agents watching us
Got niggas hitting Glocks see us I love (?)
See I'm above any nigga that you name
Hop up out the blue thang
With two flames like ""What you saying?""
I do's my thug thang daily
380 tucked under the seat of the S-Class
Shots rip your chest fast
I'm a mother fucking mess man
Street niggas fo sho
A fire Hot Boy - ok? Ya know

We only like gangsta shit
Cause I drive a gangsta car
And street niggas run this shit
We only like gangsta broads
If you wanna see gangsta shit
Then push me a lil too far
Cause street niggas might not quite
You gone have to call the law

Niggas keep they stash in they ass
Round where I'm from
Uptown and that Nolia we sold smoked chumps
Quick to steal a nigga any time of the day
If his ass outta line we ain't standing all day
Pimp, play off top better believe that dog
And plus we stay strapped ducking short of the law
I run with solid niggas that'll ride for me
Shit head Craig, Running Red and my nigga Big Ki
Shit I rap about - I'm one nigga that live it
Coke, dope, guns, nigga I live it
I'm only 19 and I'm down for killing
Just because a nigga rap dog don't get it twisted
I send shots quick through your Jerseys and Filas
My finger get to flicking please believe I ain't missing
Lil Turk +Young & Thuggin'+ know you niggas know about me
Cash Money Hot Boy play dog and watch me cock it
I'm a street nigga


If I rap about it nigga I done lived it out
It ain't shit I'm fantasying this shit I been 'bout
I'm a ghetto mother fucker, keep a K with a drum
Quick to do a nigga something, I don't give a fuck
I run the streets, all 12 months of the year
And where I'm from you can't come
If you ain't from round here
I'm thugged out to the fullest - call me B.G
Someone you don't want to play with cause I'm H-O-T
Fire, burning, scorching, flaming
You gone melt nigga wishing that it was raining
Play the game as you want - wined up in a trunk
You better think before you do because you don't
I be bustin' heads, running from feds, duckin' laws
Ride all day don't rest til I kill 'em all
I be thuggin' hard and you know that I play it raw
Send ya to the morgue
Cause I'm a mother fucking street nigga


I had a little boo in the other hood
I used to go by her house in the wee-wee hours
Creeping, laying the wood
They had niggas on the block but they knew I was cool
But still on G.P. I used to keep me a two
Cause she know not what a nigga think
Plus you know now that if a nigga tryin' pull gank
That's life though
Whodie just like I thought - bitch was straight hatin' dog
Me I was 'bout having war, I was impatient ya'll
I stopped going by my peeps house chillin'
I stayed in my hood plotting how I'm gone kill him
Now my girl say the nigga been watching the house
So I'mma go and show the whodie what this drama about
What I'mma do to him its gonna make his momma freak out
I'mma either get him in or outside of his house
People gone say ""Lord, lil one died hard
Took it to the head five times in the backyard""",https://genius.com/Hot-boys-gangsta-nigga-lyrics

Look, I just come from outta town, nigga broke in my crib
Disrespect where I live, 20 g's up for who he is
He don't have the slightest mothafuckin' idea - who he dealin with
Ahh he don't know how real it get
He gonna get his wig split, looked over the bricks - got nothing
But I don't play nigga, try'na take mine from him
For him ta know I was gone - know I wasn't home
Somebody had ta be in on it that I know
Time ta go in the closet, with a ride or die fit
Black hood - Girbauds - ski mask and Reebok classics
It's spreading 'bout them 20's - somebody gonna talk
Give it 3 or 4 days for it ta come out the dark
Oh what I told ya, niggas can't pull me ta the side
He ain't lying - I had the vibe, it was a podnuh of mine
But for me, he showed, wasn't no love in him
So I ain't hesistate ta put them fuckin' slugs in him
(Hook 4x - )
Jack who, Take what, from who, not me
Slip and think you can sleep - after fuckin' with B.G

(Look, Look, Look)
Nigga know I got that work - so he plottin' and watchin'
Try'na see when I'm gone - so he can break in my house and
I'ma bake a cake for him, make him think I'm outta town
I know he here hustlin' I'm on my monkey talkin' loud
Tellin' my round I'll  be there, pick me up from the 'port
On my way ta Nashville, 10 bricks I'm gonna score
Prolly get a lil' dope, cuz that dope make more money
20 dollars for a bag, Half-a-gram for a 100
This nigga just don't know, I'm on top of my game
Shoulda kept it too himself but instead he told Elan
Better get that nigga Turk, so I got ta bust his brains
If I let that nigga slide, he gonna try ta do it again
Gatta handle mine, gatta get rid of him quik
Bust him up fast, throw him in the lake then split
Jack who, take what, from who, not me
Get a bullet in ya head leave that ass on the street
(Hook 4x - )
Jack who, Take what, from who, not me
Slip and think you can sleep - after fuckin' with Teke

(aight)
Okay let me explain, been sittin' on 5 bricks of cocaine
Since the drought came
Niggas be constantly blowing me up try'na cop thangs
But the price remain 10
I don't change it or curve it - I just slang it and serve it
You see the game is got these niggas hurtin'
The money's nervous, so they try'na get at me for service - Let's make it happen
I'm only askin' for dime a ki' - 5 for half
Quarters go 3 - you do the rest of the math
And nigga offer me 55 so I figure he ballin'
But at my price any average hustler with dough can afford
But I'ont know this ol' nigga so I'ma tax him 60 g. bandits
The extra 5 for shippin'-n-handlin'
When I met him, he in all black, talking 'bout he be back

She ain't selling none of that, look I need ta get that back
I'ma pay my people, what I owe them, Cuz I know them
And shit a get real fast,and I might have ta show them
I ain't gon' let the bitch walk, like everthing is super either
She done change i-den-tities and acting as two people
A smart bitch, but fucked up in the game
Cuz I found out her social secruity number the same
Quickly, got the location and bust up her brains
Click on the 5 o'clock news, they ain't mention her name
Gatta, clear head - this for the time being
Cuz these bitches right around me
Be the ones that mind sceaming
I sell brown ta you's frown nigga
Fuck how you feel - ain't no rules now nigga

Now a nigga was makin cake rolls by the case loads
Kept a chopper with a arm fold wherever I go
And I always had to hustle & I could go head

Bitches wanna be next, I picked the case
And then I broke through the Jects
Damn them bitches saw me i hope they don't talk
But if i think they gone talk beleive they ain't
Gonna walk, you see these golds, these diamonds
All these houses, these jews, they got niggas

I know that everyday i gotta protect my naps
I know that a nigga wait'n trying to put it in my lap!

Introduction,Let ’Em Burn,2003.0,"Bring Noise, I got something on my shoulder - that bitch is so heavy
AK-47 attached ta a Mac-11, double clipped taped up
Ready ta spray something, 175 shots ta clear the block
I've ride through your neighborhood, day and night
Store closed people inside, ya hood on strike
I'm looking, for ya - high and low, nigga I'm searchin'
11 deep in the (2000) new Ford Excursion
Me and my nigga P. - brother Diesel and Wee
Bell - Tyriq and Fat - Kay - Powder and Cleve
Once you found you get down, burn torchin' and beat
That's the treatment you get from a nigga in C.M.B
I'm the B.G. but you can call me - Shot 'em up shorty
I'll get mad and try ta flush your head down the toirlet
Baby gave me the game - when this niggas that's bitch made
Gimme my props, call it Ace a Ace a spade of spades nigga

Boss you wouldn't believe what happend ta me
Last night I got hit for a package of ki's
Who was it? Man I'ont know some cats
They kicked in my doo' shot my wife in the back
And you think them mothafuckers woulda left it at that
They beat me in my head until I said where it's at
Okay we go out in the streets and we get the word
We hit up anybody that we think selling them birds
Them fuckin moolignanis don't want no war'
C4 them down, let 'em burn in the car
Me not worried about no witness
Cuz them won't see, anything linkin' up ta me
Boss, come ta find out it was Red and Black
Them connivin' motherfuckers gatta pay for that
I tell you what I gonna do, burn them cock roaches
And payment for the cops in case they wanna approach us

I'm the O.G. nigga 'bout money and bitches
Know how, ta flip a brick and deal with ditches
My brother K.C. told me how ta kill these niggas
While Troy had me in alleys dealin' with digits
Aiy, life is real my nigga, me and Lac pa' was killed my nigga
It ain't nothing keep it real my nigga
While my homies carve life in the field my nigga
Ski' then family - thrill deal niggas
Rambo and Sam - it is what it is niggas
I've robbed niggas - pulled triggers for niggas
Drama's involved - we in like we in nigga
Homicide - we kill like we kill nigga
Behind them thangs - it is what it is nigga
Birdman - a known shotcaller
Suburban man and Benzes and Prowlers

(look - look - look - look)
Here comes Mister Bad nerves
Wit' that fed-up look
Shorty got that do-whatever-for-the-cheddar look
Ain't got no dope, weed or fetti plus I'm hurt and hungry
All I got is this Beretta with 2 murders on it
I done walk 'bout four blocks
In a pair of old 'Boks
Dirty with no socks
Looking for dope spots
Man I'm on the prowl - untamed and wild
Been a year since I smiled
Better watch that child
Hat over my eyes, you can't see my frustation
Looking at niggas paper chasin' with mean faces
Was told wait my turn - but damn I'm impatient
Pacin' the streets with the Mac-10 blazin'
Lil' Brother bail please, I'ma kill him for the scrilla
Do you under smell me - I'm telling your dawg
I was raised on bad ways
Went to school on half days
Half smart and half crazed
Stop playin' with me

It's in my bloodstream wodie, ta be the nigga that I am
Tote gats with hats take a nigga from his fam'
Nothin' but streets shit - it's all a nigga know
Knockin you off ya feet quick - it's all a nigga know
Drive-bys in U-Hauls - prepared anyday
Thuggin' is usual, do that every day
Bitch niggas get roast, if your not from round my way
Middle of the court or one of them hallways
Quick ta steal ya, I'm real I ain't fake
Leave ya ass a murder scene in the middle of yellow tape
Put a hole in ya thinkin' cap, won't be thinkin no mo'
You'll be put ta nap

Second step I Spin Tha Bend, Bussin, wettin bitches
I'm goin back to my old self, Pullin my Chopper of the shelf
Wackin' you bitches until it's no one left
I don't play when I'm off in some drama you know me
It's kill or be killed when you beefin' wit B.G
And nothing less than a hundred out the drum clearing the street
Yellow tapes and white sheets on yo block all week
Bitch niggas that can't take the heat stay concealed
They know if they get caught in the middle they won't live
Ain't no other way for me to keep it besides real
Disrespecting my mind, no doubt you a done deal
I'ma BLOCKA, CHICKA BANG, CHICK BUST
I'ma BOOM, chicka RAT, TAT, TAT ya home up
It's bout it when I pulled up get got it gone with the wind
You bet not be nowhere on the block when I spin tha bend

Spots I be discoverin', niggas I be trumblin'
Stoppin' up on bubblin, from one side to the other end
Hoppin' out the bubble Benz, poppin' him and other friends
Bitches I be smotherin' niggas just be stutterin'
Juvenile don't run no mo' I been through this shit before
Spin A Bend kick in yo door, lay it all down on the floor
Tell me something I don't no, All you bitches gotta go
Give me please all of the coke or I'ma shoot you in yo throat
Fuck it I'ma never stop, standin' on whateva block
Lookin' for the cheddar spot, open up a better shop
I'ma jet when it get hot, Keep everything that I got
Damn it if I'm straight or not, I'm gone always be on top
Niggas wanna do me in, I'm here come and pursue it then
Heads I'm gone be shootin' and you will never move again
I'm not a gentleman or sweeter then cinnamon
Everytime I spin tha bend they say ""Oh no it's him again""

*Look, Look*
Nothin but soldiers where I stay, niggas dressin' in camouflage
Real niggas 'bout pullin triggas and doin' drive-by's
Cut-throaters and snakes, keep the murder rate high
Niggas who carry Kays ready for war at any time
Killas who hit ya spot and don't care who be outside
People they call it hots sell heroin and rocks
Hallways & Cuts, stay duckin them cops
Stay on they P's & Q's you bet not try and plot
Nigga if you do believe you gone get chopped
50 fly at you like birds in a flock
And if you gotta crew one by one they gone drop
And if  you got that work we closing down ya shop
My niggas be thugged out, Jabows and Reeboks
Bush fades and braides no designs and flat-tops
From the youngest to the oldest, they nuts lettin' em drop
Spin Yo Bend like a dryer takin you off yo block nigga

Niggas try'na take that ass, make it their girlfriends
Na' eat that meat, fold my clothes
Cuz all you niggas ain't nothing but hoes

Nigga what? I don't give a fuck
Lil' BGeezy show these niggas you don't give a fuck

My presidents make a nigga break it off
Becuz they know if they don't off this earth
I'ma take them off, nigga I play it raw
You think about droppin' your nuts, better pick them up
Cuz you and everybody wish that I'ma hit 'em up
So nigga give me mine, don't make me have ta take it
Cuz I put your family in a fucked up situation
Your mama like where my son at?
Everybody know I done that
But the law, don't know where the gun at
So they can't touch me, can't question me
Can't fuck wit me - so it's an unsolved mystery
BGeezy a dawg yea
Don't give a fuck about the law
Ready ta send you ta the morgue yea
Have you feelin' like a number 2 pencil
When I put that lead in you
They fly ta H-Town in Continental
Live with a bad bitch, have my hoe strapped too

Block of blocks, I rob niggas
Better drop it like its hot 'fore you die nigga
You can think it's a game if you want, they fly nigga
Them hollows hit you live, uh uh nigga
You be left as a memory, on a fresh white is ya picture
I keep it on the low, so no one a know that I did ya
Playin' like that, these days niggas a stain ya
Play the game rap, kidnap ya L.G. and (rape) her
I'm dirty so they call me low down - where I'm from
Shot first, I can't miss with a chopper with a drum
I'm shootin' ta kill - no wheel chairs or shit bags
I shoot you in places where I know you gon' die fast
Ya head and ya chest wodie
Catch ya dippin' by ya whole house when ya loaded
Give it too ya in blood, that's one way of solvin' problems my nigga
Come around my spot - don't know ya that's a problem my nigga

All I know is bend swangin' - make the enemy block scorch
Nigga I been hangin' - oh I ain't just jump off out the porch
I'ma iron toter, my niggas got me drinkin' Henne' - got my mind towed up
So all I do is +Spin tha Bend+ I keep my rag top
I had it on ever since the day my dad died
And now it's on and I'm ready for guerilla war
This C.M.B. - y'kno who my only niggas are, the 17th
I put it down for my lil' thug niggas - too young ta get in the club niggas
But waitin' front so when you come out they bust nigga
Trust nigga, this shorty wild
And I been thuggin' with BGeezy - he taught me how
Now play with me and watch it catch it fire

Geezy been through it, if I said I done it you gon believe I did do it
Everyday hood shit I lived through it

I went in with all these killas so all I know is head bustin'
Keep a gun and I pull the trigger clear the block in a hurry
All that unnecessary jaw-jabbin' I let my pistol bark at 'em
Never thought niggas would start static bring that guerrilla war at em
The danger boys pull out the heat
And hit they street and just gon flame the boys
Them niggas from the U.P.T. you just can't tame the boys
Them niggas from the C.M.B. they iron slangers boy
Better whatch out, whtach out
Pull up on the set and just hop out with the Glock out
Leave a nigga wet and flip they block out and shot out
Bullets be hummin', my niggas be stompin'
Cowards be runnin like them ""woop"" people comin

Cuz it's gon' be some shit I'm bout to do that you won't like
Picture this, a chrome pipe, up to your dome hot

You found a nigga that you thought was a ho
Took something from your family, that you valued the most
Chose to beef, chose to creep, but my lady
She's pregnant from me
She's 5 months, so we lookin at oh, a three?
Before my baby bout to touch down
Cause man I gotta live can't get my head bust now
I'm Bustin at niggas, grieving over my partners that's gone
All my P's in the projects with a lotta that chrome
Playin a chess game, gotta keep my eye on the next man
I dont know you from adam and eve, but I can vouch for me

I take It off your shoulder
Nigga, I'm thuggin' in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fucked over
I take It off your shoulder
Nigga, I'm thuggin' in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fucked over

Watch yourself, it's getting bad and dangerous
We bout that foolishness, so niggas scared to hang wit us
 dressed up in black
Ridin around every ward ready to jack
It ain't used to be like that, till the drought rolled round'
Now niggas occupationally kickin' them doors down
Curly head on my back 24/7
And If I gotta deal with these niggas and bitches with 2-11
What do you call them niggas that are duckin the law (Hot)
Who them niggas who just shot up your car
What you call them niggas that be ready for war (Hot)
What you call them niggas that be goin too far
Hot Boys running with kerosene running through everything
Doing shit, that you never seen
To Mag, to the Yo to the Melphamine
Niggas talk bout me but very seldom I'm seen
Juvi duckin them feds, runnin around with pimp Reg
Clockin' the K's puttin' hallow lead into your head
My enemies fled
They gon get Murdered 
Some motherfucker claiming that he representin
But He ain't from the nolia, so this shit ain't worth me listening
This is my system
Like an addiction interrogatin the minds of
My victim's they can't see becuz they bitchin it's takin
I'm making doubters out believers
When my blood pressure get high hold up yo dick beater, cause
This Nigga, will not be hut, we livin in that UTP
And in God we trust
Last of the real niggas in the Jects' went nuts
And you will teach yo' niggas to be respecting us, uh-huh..

I take It off your shoulder
Nigga, I'm thuggin' in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fucked over
I take It off your shoulder
Nigga, I'm thuggin' in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fucked over

If I wasn't a thinker, I'll probably be dead right now
One of these niggas quick to bust my head by now
But liable now, I'm still survivin, cool and konivin'
Now I got my enemy drivin, I know that nigga be robbin'
Imma tell that nigga let me out at the light
And when he put that bitch in park, thats the end of his life
2 or my people, look nigga I got a plan
And when I see 200 keys of that sand
I'm a marked man, so I'll put that shit in yall hand
I'mma be shotcallin, all of my niggas ballin
Juve you bout it
Wayne is you bout it
Turk you bout it
Slim you bout it
Derrick you bout
Baby you bout it
Fresh you bout it
Tank is you bout it
Co is you bout it
B.G., ballers you buyed it
You and you, you buyed it
This motherfuckin investigation on me?
This bitch I was fuckin' gave information on me?
And it's gonna be a bitch to beat these alligations
They tried to torture me with questions at the police station
If theres boo-ku operation's
They'll inject the streets with playa hatin, tell'em I'm turnin statin
Niggas gonna be waiting, fuck that, I'd rather take my chances
Hit the Bitch in a minute, I rearrange advanced shit

I take It off your shoulder
Nigga, I'm thuggin' in the magnolia
You better do what I told ya
Unless you want to get fucked over

That Melph, that Calio, VL, 10th Ward, everybody, check it
Turk:
Untamed gorillas
Uptown for sho'
Gettin' full of that raw Mac Melph Calio
Totin choppers on the street like it's very legal
Lovin' blue eyes and curly hair cuz that's fuckin' people
These niggas wet, head smokin' from his beretta led
Shouldn't fuck with niggas in that 3 cuz they surely don't play
Chop you down in a minute
Yo' head, quick to spin it
Set it off with 50 shots
Ain't no stoppin' till it's finished
Rag tag, leave ya fizad with bullet holes
On yo bizack with bloody clothes you know
Thug niggas
Like sockets we plug niggas
Head busters
Showin' no love ass niggas
Bout beefin'
At night they bout that creepin
Tearin' it down
No more DJ's for the weekend
Chop you down real quick
Like that razor Gillette
Body acceptin' bullets like 1-800-Collect
Chorus (Juvenile):
Livin' in that 3rd where niggas got shot
They got 9 millis and infrared dot
A buncha niggas totin' choppers that's quick to wet you up
I said them niggas from uptown don't give a mother fuck

Turk:
Part 2
And you know, what we bout, them hustles
Still niggas, kill niggas, work for the men with shovels
Still nigga, fuck with that 3 it's a must that you die
Real nigga, ??? got on a box with camoflauge
Macs, SK's, Choppers, that's all we play
Spin up in at night, big nuts from broad day
Leavin' yo' block wet
Don't give a fuck who get hit
Bangin' and kill
So if you get split you get split
In that UPT, they got that monkey on they back
Niggas in that 3 won't hesitate to leave ya crack
If you slip in Uptown, then you fucked nigga
Pullin' triggers full of that brown ducked out nigga
Totin' choppers
That's wet ya leave ya foul nigga
Uptown don't give a fuck, and they wild nigga
In that Magnolia, nigga knock ya head off ya shoulders
Reload to LD will fuck clean over ya
Left with no figgas
Fucked up from 50 niggas
6 ft. is where you'll be
On t-shirts is ya picture
Chorus
Turk:
In that 3 we pack 2's that'll bruise when we spit
Choppers with 50, so it ain't no way we won't hit
Playin' a game with no rules so you get crept on
Red dots beamin' u better have your vest on
Uptown consists of nothin' but them real niggas
Packin' steel niggas
Won't hesitate to kill niggas
Sharp shooter ?????? nigga at far range
Killin' you niggas ain't no thang so yo' brains hang
Choppers be ringin' like a motherfuckin' church bell
Niggas get served like a junkie with a drug sell
Runnin' shop is them off of ???
???? and they strapped with autillary
In that Melph, niggas will leave ya where ya standin
Poppin' trunks and they pullin' out the cannons
Pullin' triggers that'll soak ya leave ya brainless

3 Strikes,Let ’Em Burn,2003.0,"I got popped in 94' them people caught me with some coke
But I pleaded as a user so the judge let me go
Now I'm back on the streets with six months of probation
Can't go out the state so I can't take no vacation
Got to watch my conversation cause them people a fool
Got to be in before 11 and I can't miss school
But I was talkin to that nigga sammy
Tryin to see how I'm a get these 20 bricks from miami
On a chip phone so I'm thinking they ain't tracin mine
Two days later I'm in that place facing 99
But slim and baby bought a laywer for a half a mil'
And he kept fightin and he got me out on appeal
My niggas real
So I know I got to play it light
I gotta watch what I do cause I'm on my second strike
But if I ever fall agian I'm history
So I'm a keep everything low so they can't get to me
3 strikes nigga

3 strikes you out, 3 strikes you lose
3 strikes you fall, 3 strikes you catch the blues
3 strikes you out, 3 strikes you lose

Look

The judge ain't playin they givin you 99
They dont giva fuck who you is they dont discriminate
Come up with a decision there it is closed case
Ain't nothing you can do nigga you goin do that time
Take it like a man dont cry you done the crime
Seen a lot a niggas fall short like that
I done seen a lot a niggas run through cuts with a gat
I done seen a lot a niggas get they wig pushed back
I done seen a lot a niggas get busted for crack
Not me cuzin as long as I'm with CMB cuzin
Got my mind straight I'm no longer on that D cuzin
So tell me how I'm a do wrong I'm doing right
You feds can't fuck with me cause I'm doing right
So you can take all the bitches you want
You can play numba down you can't stop me

3 strikes you out, 3 strikes you lose

I know any day it can happen go to jail or get killed
Thats why I try to walk light but on the streets its too real
I just had a lil girl so hard I try to chill
But I still find my self on the block chasin the mil
Ask the lord to guide me right keep my mind of bad
Got this monkey ride my back tellin me to a bag
Got a judge front a nigga tryin to send me away
Cause I got my second gun charge possesion of a A-K
Now I'm due for sometime 15 with a bail
But I refuse to take that cause I'll never get well
But I promise if the lord hold me from under this
Ain't got to worry about me coming back for shit
Never thought when I get older they would offer me 10
I was waiting for my uncle come home looking like I would meet him in the pin
I ain't let em worry me real is what ive been, but
Now I'm on my third strike but I'm a hit the streets agian nigga

3 strikes you out, 3 strikes you lose

3 strikes you out, 3 strikes you lose
3 strikes you fall, 3 strikes you catch the blues

What the fuck you mean I got an attachment
They got crooks out here bitch go harass them
I used to pull it all I used to sell dope
I used to whip hoes I used to snort coke
I used to shoot at niggas I used to steal cars
I used to start wars up in that 3rd ward
I used to disrespect old people and talk crazy
Untill a nigga got his mind right and met baby
Im pushin neener neener
Light on my pinkey finger
Motherfuck a sapena
Cause I'm a rap singer
Dont want no charges
Even though I got a stash in my garages
You bitches looking at me as though I am retarded
But you can never twist me up with all that war shit
Whodi you heard me
You bitch now you want to make sure that I'm gone
Away from my kids reposes my cars and my home
Thats what you want

These Hoes,Let ’Em Burn,2003.0,"I feel it... I feel it...
This a public service announcement

Once upon time in this place called club
Met this cutie with big bootie so I gave that girl a dub
Later on that night we had plans and shit
If you take me from the club then I'm gonna let you hit
If I take you from the club will you always be in love?
And you promise to love no other man? (I do)
See she looked me in my face put her hands up on my waist
And said ""Yes baby this I understand""
Now my life is like happy, bout to be a pappy
And it's all because of my girl
But just, then, this nigga walked in
And what he said fucked up my whole world
He said my, bitch, and your, bitch been freakin each other
I, had, relations with your bitch and I didn't use a rubber
My blood rushed down and my heart touched the ground
Felt like somebody stabbed me with a knife
Now I look at what I done, somebody get my gun
Can't change a hoe to a housewife (ya see?)

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Will make you kill them, if it wasn't for the children
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Will make you kill them, better leave the building

Down Here,Let ’Em Burn,2003.0,"You know about the hot boys nigga, you know about the hot boys nigga
Nigga say New Orleans fake, nigga better fear down here
We have mo' murders than the days and a year down here
You got coke we'd a make ya disappear down here
You outta line we'd a leave ya block clear down here
If you ain't from here, you better not come live down here
We drank champagne we don't fuck with beer down here
We straight snakes we come at'cha from the rear down here
We straight guerrillas you get it how you live down here
I'ma chopper toter I ain't never showed no fear
I duct tape ya rope ya and cut ya from ear ta ear
B Geezy is one of the hottest niggas in the pad
Get outta line with me and I'll leave ya shit flat
Clickin' and clackin' blacka and bangin' ridin' at night
Jackin' and slangin' hustlin' and peerin' man that's my life
Baby, slim, fresh, juve, weezy, turk, that's my clique
Disrespect 'em a get 'cha call ta the morgue quick nigga
You know about the hot boys
Disrespect 'em a get a call ta the morgue quick
I come with, K's and Glocks, ready ta spray the block
Raise the spot, blica-blazin' hot
See I'm the, youngest C.M.B. nigga holly grove hard hitter
Get rid of niggas if you come with the correct scrilla
I'm on de'netha dela it turn me ta killer
Say it's a shame 'cause Wayne an untamed guerrilla
Ya got the dope and ya-ya you drop it like it burn
I get that rope and tape and I gotta have yurn
I know I'm raw I know I'm out thea' bad
But I get it how I live 'cause that drought ain't playin'
And I'm 'bout that cash, so I can bounce back fast
So I gotta dress in black with dirty Reboks and mask
Pass me the smell of braise let me blow out my brain
I'm on the block, hotter than a trench ready ta do it again
Lil' weezy hot boy have you feelin' the flames
'Cause these blood stains, in ya, Hilfiger my man
I ain't with that bull shittin' lil' one so take heave
I ain't gonna stop until all of you bitches leave
You mothafuckin' right I got a complex
You mothafuckin' right I'm takin' hits, with a contract
Been in nigga everywhere but under the foots
I'm try'na take lil' daddy head outta the roots
I'll catch him in the broad daylight I won't give a fuck
Find me a illegal dice game we gon' fuck it up
Because niggas, try they best, ta catch me
But I ain't, gonna let 'em, stretch me
I'm not, abouta run, 'cause I'm a soulja
I keeps, me a gun, when in that nolia
My tongue, never lose, 'cause I'm a fool
Ask a nigga who bout it, them AK's rule
You better not be running through niggas that I despise
Catch you off ya bases leave the murder rate high
Uptown is where I'm from Magnolia soulja 'til I die
Keep a chopper with a drum realest they come ready ta ride
I never been a hoe nigga I been 'bout drama
Never hung with the young niggas I run with the ol' timers
Nigga want start something won't talk about you bring it
If you up weight it don't stunt we leave you banged
You didn't say you didn't, be a man don't be no hoe
If you live by the gun then by the gun is how you go
Niggas don't fight no more all they do is slang that iron
Niggas they killin' slow that's how it go in
Ain't no rules too this shit spread when you wan' spread it
Shoot then talk later play it how you wan' play it
You got a problem with me nigga we can do it how you wanna
Spin a bend in broad daylight and I bet'cha you be a goner
Shit nigga I'm goin' all out behind mine
Burn your block down, at any given time nigga, what?
Nigga, what? Nigga, what? Nigga, what? we come na tear it up, what?",https://genius.com/Hot-boys-down-here-lyrics
