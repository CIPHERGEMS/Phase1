Norf Norf,Summertime 06,2015,"Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smoking out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop-block the corner
Giving hell 'til it's frozen over
I ain't never ran from nothing

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-norf-norf-lyrics

Fuck your dead homies, run your bread, homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Bimmer bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit
Livin' for that True Religion is broke shit
I can spend that on a MAC with a long clip
Fly in that Benz, but you hide in that Focus
My nigga, just focus, I'm trying to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner get stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to doming
That's somebody's son, but a war to be won
Baby, either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket, he called me a crab
So I shot him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

What means the world to you?
Is it a fast life, money, and clothes?
Probably fucking these hoes?
Or what would you murder for?
Will your name hold weight when the curtains close?
Nigga caught one case, and I heard he told
Snitch get a full clip and closed casket
Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shooting, no practice
Been touring, whip foreign, coupe crashing
Still banging 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still ""fuck the police,"" they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clapping
Kids crying, still snipe him, no lacking

I was up late night balling
So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down do Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, god damn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie
Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz
Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click, clack, clap
Or the boop, bop, bam, cuz

It's funny I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread
From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain

Blue Suede,Hell Can Wait,2014,"New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been known this
Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us
Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers
Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers
Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now
Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too
L-B-P-D get sprayed on too
Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof
Blowing 40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy
Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios

New shoes with the blue suede

Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been known that
Blowing on dicks for spliffs and cold Cognac
Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's
Where the coke at? Love white like Bobby wife
Finna party like it's prom tonight
Finna kill a nigga walkin' to his moms tonight
Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal
Best deal that the judge finna offer: life
Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison
And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life
Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night
Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches
Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden
Nigga, fuck that

Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets

I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless

Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now
Cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie
How dare you think it's different

Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling

Floating on them peons
Go in 'til they take my bro'nem out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects

A deep dive, but within acceptable range

Clap your hands if the police ever profiled
You ain't gotta worry, don't be scary 'cause we on now
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now

Lift Me Up,Summertime 06,2015,"Right now
Hey!

I'm just a nigga, until I fill my pockets
And then, I'm Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shopping (Uh-huh)
I feel like Mick and Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters (Uh-huh)
So tell me, what's the difference? So tell me, what's the difference? (Hey)
My momma was a Christian, Crip-walking on blue waters
Was fading up to Davis, then walking back to Palmer
A fro like Huey partner, Auntie Angie had them choppers (Uh-huh)
So tell me, what's the difference? So tell me, what's the difference? (All right!)
I feel like ""Fuck Versace"", they raping niggas' pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, and Moses looked like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aiming at Nirvana (Nirvana)
My bitch look like Madonna ('Donna), they staring at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should've brought the chopper
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer

See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions, fix me up

Is dead and green,
 
was standing on this mezzanine in Paris, France
Finna spaz 'cause most my homies never finna get this chance
All these white folks chanting when I asked 'em, ""Where my niggas at?"" (Uh-huh)
Going crazy, got me going crazy, I can't get with that
Wonder if they know I know they won't go where we kick it at
Ho, this shit ain't Gryffindor, we really killing, kicking doors (Hey)
Fight between my conscience, and the skin that's on my body
Man, I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari
Man, I breathe and bleed this Poppy Street
I shot them guns 'cause talk is cheap
Bow your head and pray, okay, now, walk with me (You know it)

See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up

Open up your mind, and tell me whatcha seein'

Don't make me regret it, baby

I guess we somewhere in between

But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missin' you
I'm searchin' for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid
And people left alone

Don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-summertime-lyrics
Nate,Shyne Coldchain II,2014,"As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
""Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!""
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

As a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand
Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man
Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans
Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, 
used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless,
 I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

No, No, No, No
Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that

And them glass shoes ain't made to walk

Unpaved, unscathed

Said that you was comin' through after dark
To look at the stars and hardly speak

This thing called love is a God to me

Rather go to Calipat, or murdered while I'm shootin' back
Call me King Latifah
If we talkin' bout your bitch and she a keeper
Better keep her in the house
Watch your mouth
Don't be talkin' from the bleachers, nigga

Once you get addicted to it

I just wanna be DaVinci baby
Why they wanna kill me, baby?
Feelin' like a pop star, music drive a nigga crazy
Think I'm finna pull a Wavves on the Primavera stage
On some prima donna shit, finna throw it all away
I don't need no accolades, boy I'm here to act a fool
Ask about me, had the shotty, robbin' niggas after school
Me and Pac Slimm, we been shootin' since the Vans song
Pullin' any trigger that a nigga got his hands on
Lookin' at my vida, all this money, all these visas
All these mothafuckin' mini mes I know they wanna be him
Either with it or against it nigga, ain't no in-betweenin'
If you say you wanna kill the man then dump it when you see him pussy

Jump Off the Roof,Summertime 06,2015,"What's your addiction, baby?
Love can make a bitch go crazy
Kiss, hug, fuck and then get faded
Fall out and it's all-out war
Head twirl and your vision blurry
Dopeman in that kitchen stirrin'
Sold it, we so lit, dope burners
Fuck is you so forgetful for?
Girl, you know that you need that raw
Girl, you know that you need Visine
Preem laced with that cocaín'
Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans
Cop a feel, cop a half-sixteen
Pour a deuce up and then start leaning
Tryna die higher than Pimp C
And Big Moe, you know how the shit go
(You know how the shit go)

I pray to God 'cause I need him, I need him, I need him
Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiending, I'm fiending, I'm fiending
Life way too hard, am I dreaming? I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Highway to Hell and I'm speeding, one way to tell if I'm breathing

On three, let's jump off the roof; on three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof; on three, let's jump off the roof
On three, let's jump off the roof; on three, let's jump off the roof

Baby girl, love me, I'll love you back
Just don't turn your back on me
Though I'm borderline crazy, mama, crack baby
Seizures come when I sleep
So just hold my hand, darling, don't wanna be
A part of your problem, just wanna sleep
Without my lungs stopping, like they used to
I hate when you lie, I hate the truth too
Can't wait 'til you die, I hate that we through
Fuck around and get a man
Leave him dead where he stand with the blam
I ain't playing with a motherfucker
I was raised at the end of the land
With the surf and the sand
Get a tan in this motherfucker
Wanna feel how you feel, if it's mine, then it's real
Then it's fine, baby girl, I don't need a rubber
Nothing wrong in the world with another mother
(You know how the shit go)

I pray to God 'cause I need him, I need him, I need him
Cocaine withdrawals and I'm fiending, I'm fiending, I'm fiending
Life way too hard, am I dreaming? I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
Highway to Hell and I'm speeding, one way to tell if I'm breathing
On three, let's jump off the roof; on three, let's jump off the roof

War Ready,Prima Donna,2016,"Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God...with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock, put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay

Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
War ready, your boys lost already
Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
War ready, your boys lost already

My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think of heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or my brains to the ceiling
Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling
Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit
Ain't a thang to a G
Life give you lemons, nigga hang from a tree
Cold game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Fought to the death, never gave in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
Heaven, Hell, free or jail, same shit
County jail bus, slave ship, same shit
A wise man once said that a black man better off dead
So I'm, war-ready

Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
War ready, your boys lost already
Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
Born ready, war-ready
War ready, your boys lost already

Learned the power of words when we was younger
Saying fuck the sign on his curb can make him hunt you
Turned the African into a nigga then they hung him
Said it earlier in the verse, sometimes I wonder
Who the activist and who the Devil's advocate
Or do it matter? Shit
They only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich
Or got a platinum hit
A chain or two
Seem the music interchangeable
Raging bull, what you headed for?
Heaven doors, or hell below
I write directions for the road to let you know
Edgar Allen Poe
Tried to warn 'em of demise and all he seen was crows
Feel for 'em, words, we kill for 'em
Leave the bitchin' to the birds, we still war'n
Born ready, you boys lost already
All in 'til the lord get me

Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-war-ready-lyrics

Love can be a lot, so maybe not
You can give me all the cash you got
Let me take those keys around the block
Make some memories on daddy's yacht
I'm so over you
You talk a lot of shit, unamused
Ain't putting on the ritz for no dude
I can finish you, I can fill them shoes
You know my name, I'm not your babe
What's that you're saying? I don't speak lame
You know my name, I'm not your babe
If you're thinking of calling, kindly refrain

Wannabes buzzing
Girls love the lifestyle
So prone to clubbing
Come alive when the night's out
Just crashed a sports car
So much for fast life
Phone calls from loves lost
Tryna get back right

Love can be so disheartening, darling

Tell the world I want my Uchies
Dodge the groupies, them don't move me
Uchies moved me somewhere cozy
Uchies never leave me lonely
Call my phone, say she horny, want me
I can make time or I can make money
I'ma keep countin', count me out, shawty
Never let a bitch Lil Bow Wow me
Never finna weekend raise my seed
Baby mama drama on the TMZ
Alimony money for the nails and weave
Nail me to the cross like that boy JC
Chuckin' up the deuce like the boy Chris Breeze
But we don't suwoop on the six-five street
Riding down the shoreline, tank on E
No shotgun seat,

Limos,Hell Can Wait,2014,"I can love you
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you better

Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up
Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front
Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club
Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want
18 years with a check coming every month
Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win

Say you love her, you losin'
She dont want him involved
Keep your heart in your chest
And your head in the stars
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost

I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better

He don't love her at all, but he fuckin' her raw
Tales of Adam and Eve birthin' a bitch and a dog
How you follow a heart colder than winter in Prague
Love for the wealth and the self, her mind full of everything else
The Bible she hide in the shelf, doubt she ever open it
Lost in the world, just tryin' to figure where to go from here
Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is
Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself
Scared of the future, runnin' from the past
Like she's starin' in the grave while you starin' at her ass
Young, dumb, and depraved, heart numb from the pain
Eyes strain from the tears, yeah, she stuck in her ways

Say you love her, you losin'
She dont want him involved
Keep your heart in your chest
And your head in the stars
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost

I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)

Crabs in a bucket
Wanna see you at the bottom, don't you love it?
When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encore
Sendin' shots but you at the top floor
Let 'em pop shit, give me some drums to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious
If not that then topless, earned all this
Get with that or get in the moshpit
Where's your moxie? Ain't you from Poppy?
Young man, you not actin' too cocky
Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Read a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
If I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put 'em in a bag
Prolly gon' regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet

Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They dont ever want to see the black man eat
Nails in the black man's hands and feet
Put him on a cross so we put him on a chain
Lying to me, sayin' he don't look like me
Rollcage on the GT3
How a show on stage like a DVD?
Put me in the MoMA when it's over with
I used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit

Remember that I still got you
I still got you here
It's rare they'd come across you?
I kept you hidden in my head
Drowning in my own ocean
I forgot to care
And you can drop the anchor, baby
I know what's under there
It never really crossed my mind to think
Maybe you'd avert your glance at me?
Ever really cross your mind
Ever really cross your mind
I ain't never had no chance to breathe",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-crabs-in-a-bucket-lyrics

If you think it's true, need you, lemme know, baby lemme know

If you feeling right, you can spend the night
We can go anywhere you like, nothing got a price
I suppose that you wasn't quite the type who be doing it
For sure, we can keep it on the low, take a load off
Soon as you walk up in the room, take your clothes off
Bed to the floor, baby, you know how it go
Nothing less and nothing more than what we make it
Consummating for a long time 'til the condom breaking
Conversations in my head about some head
You got some commentary for a nigga?
I ain't tryna be too forward with you, looking forward to you
Tryna split a couple kids, maybe mortgage with you
Do it all to get you, so just lemme know

Pop it baby (Pop it baby), don't keep me waiting (Keep me waiting)
Be my lover (Gon' be my lover), be my lady (Be my lady)
Other people (Other people), drive me crazy (Drive me crazy)
Really got me thinking about your body (About your body)

I'ma let you know that I got that dope
But if you take a toke
You gon' be running 'round tripping
'Til you get your hands on more, yeah
You gotta be certain
Before you consider fucking me
'Cause you hit this shit once
I know you gon' be in love with me",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-lemme-know-lyrics
Home,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (Soundtrack From & Inspired by the Motion Picture),2018,"This morning I woke up in a fortress of distortion
I'm at war with my emotions, I'm at war with they enforcement

Where your mind at? Never mind that
Can we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'
You win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon
I stay with my brethren, I pray for protection
My prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions
I wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?
But I'm ready and waitin'
For my day of salvation, and I'm patient

They never gon' break me, take me
Down on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead
Yeah, I never say never, but I guarantee
Gather my strength, goin' hard in the paint
Paint you a picture, it's put on display
I'm gonna get, they don't give then I take
Can't take me down now
My feet on the ground now
Fight 'til I'm down now
Say it out loud now
Say it out loud, are you ready for war?

Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So can you do me a favor, smile for me?

I know they wanna see me fall, I know they fraudulent, I know
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo
I made enough to know Ill never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the streets where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning please set me free
I hope to see you in another life times mines just not for me
Cant you see?

Every night up on my knees I pray
Smile for me
That everything will change and be ok
Smile for me
Maybe I'll stay maybe I'll pass away
Smile for me
I'm holding on to what the pastor say
Smile for me

Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
'Cause when life gets hard
And you just think
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
When life gets hard
And you cant breathe
You wanna end it all

How you feeling, everybody? Hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Don't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself
Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame
Sometimes I feel like giving up

Loco,Prima Donna,2016,"I load the 44
Then paint the Van Gogh
She rang the front door
She came commando
She came and rambled
I came and rolled over
No time for conversations cold shoulders
Outta my mind
She outta red wine
She woozy bitch bourgeois straight from Dubai
She love the hip hop and love my slick talk
Give head then begged the boy to crip walk
I write the James Joyce
Dont need the Rolls Royce
I need a straight jacket finna go bat shit
Sick of these rapper stealing my swagger
Tryna run with the penmanship practiced
Gangsta gone Gatsby
Fades with no lotion
Get this shit cracking
Crack his jaw open
Crack in my system
Daddy loved smoking
Like he loved smoking niggas no joking

Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody gets a little bit lonely
Keep breathing slowly slowly
Right place at the wrong time
Wrong turn in my own mind
Right place at the wrong time
Got lost in my own mind

It's okay, hey Vince, it's me
Things are going pretty great and this ain't what you need
Don't need to waste your time on an ignorant fuck
Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up
Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K?
Mama whooped that ass for 3 days
Parties at McDonald's for our birthday
It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say

Lemme tell ya 'bout, when a nigga went crazy
At the Marriott, having Kurt Cobain dreams
Lemme tell ya 'bout, when a nigga went loco
Ace hotel shoulda stayed at the Soho
Housekeeping keep knocking on my door though
Don't she know I'm staring in the mirror with a 44
Tryna get my head straight
She tryna get the bed straight
No room to think
KABOOM on the sink

Uhh me tienes harta
(pinche baboso abre los ojos)
Quien te cres eh? El muy chingon?
(date cuenta de lo que tienes)
Tu no eres nadien
(ya no eres niño)
Todo lo que quieres hacer te sale mal, eres un estupido no sabes nada
(Youre a grown ass mutherfuckin' man)
Nadie te toma enserio

Sabes que, vete a la chingada me caes gordo

Pinche vato pendejo

In the black Benz speeding with my black skin gleaming
Out the window
Tints low baby come and see em where the rent low
Been gone I don't need a shrink I need a hit song tryna show the world a nigga
Tweaking
Been a schizo crip though off of 65th though
Anybody killer I ain't aiming when the shit blow
Jumping through your window finna hit a lick mode
Thugging since the flip phone don't be who I flip on

We all waste away, what are you looking for?
We all waste away, what do you got in store?
We all waste away, cause I can't take much more
We all waste away, rather be lost and poor
What my pastor say? Some shit that I don't believe
What my master say? Nigga, you won't be free
Until you pass away, razor on my sleeve
Tryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep

Know you sick of all the same old things
Same club with the same champagne
Backwoods, tryna burn your brain
With a broke-ass nigga in the CarMax Range
You ain't nothing but a vivrant thing
Ass too thick for your 5'10"" frame
Want to spend all night in your nine lives?
Get to purring when that liquor get to burning
Get it cracking, why you acting like a virgin?
Where it come frommama or the surgeon?
You paid for it? Did you pray for it? Get twerking
And a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it?
Why I ask when I already know?
Don't mind me, mind already gone

91 Freeway, eastbound, speeding
Late night, but the face right, I need it
Mando, I'm the man, though, you see it
Niggas wanna kill me, so I gotta keep it
I ain't really into clubs or the nightlife
Only kick it with the thugs,
 
I ain't never did a drug
When you doing what I does, need your mind right
They won't ever catch a nigga at the stoplight

Die for a nigga? Courtroom, lie for a nigga?
Switch up to set up a snitch on a nigga?

But, um, uh, I had a b- I mean, the stuff I write about, what do I really write about?
I've got my weed songs and all my songs about my boy- uh, my ex-boyfriend, George
Songs about relationships that are kinda doomed from the start
You know, songs about when I fell in love and it went wrong
And I was so in love at the time, you know, I was like...
And I was with someone that I was in love with, you know what I mean? We were in love
You know what I mean? We were together, so-
When it- and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it- when it didn't come together, I was just like...
You know? It really hurt
But I needed enough distance from it
So that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore
But not enough distance that I'd forget
I'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess
I guess if you give me some material...

The Temptations

Raindrops on my windowsill
Longing for your nature's feel
Loved that song when we were kids
Now it makes me want you here
Sometimes, people disappear
Think that was my biggest fear
I should have protected you
Sometimes, I wish it would rain
Sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
Sometimes, I wish it would rain
The girl has found another and
Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room

CCAT trackin' criminal patterns
Trickin' niggas into takin' strikes to get out faster
Freedom bribery nigga, cause we hardly acquit
Social media that lead to flash photography snitchin'
Blame geography nigga, for the pride in these niggas
Take you when they fingerprint you, now you part of the system

Makin' profit off of violence, they arousin' attention
Leaders risin' lead to twenty-five to life in the prison

Bobby Johnson ain't my OG, this ain't no movie role
Pop's was off that O.E., trippin', gettin' his Tookie on
Thunderbird with Gold Ds, a felon and parolee
McDonald's for the Double Cheese, pockets fit a couple C-Notes
Up on the screen door sayin' pack it up and leave but we dont read those
Cause the money comin' faster than your bitch, nigga
All my life I wanted to be a rich nigga
But homie let me proceed
Pop's was moving slow poke, that's way before the codeine
Just methadone and powdered H to junkies with the sour faces
Knocking on the screen door asking for their homie Nate
Ten to twenty each, 4p.m. he leave so don't be late
Mom up off of work asking me if anybody came
To kick it with my dad or was he chilling in the alleyway
He was in the alleyway, that's what he always had me say

He shootin', sniffin', and sippin', pigs recruitin' them snitches
Cause testimonies from homies can lead to longer convictions
Police knockin' at my door, pretendin' nobody hear him
Police knockin' down my door with judicial system permission
Contraband in where we livin', hope I don't get thrown away
In the prison dogs are sniffin' backyard full of canes
Catch a case and knock it out, niggas fighting every day
Choppers circle cause a nigga chop hard on the blade
Got broads on the base, slangin' rude, we bangin' too
Where you from?
If they got that back, we clapping coming through
Going dumb, 40's selling water profit from the slums
Since we was young money been the motive
Nigga, get you some guns and dough
Bruh, I love them guns and dough, find me slangin' for the low
Come around, you getting domed, somebody at the door

Off the rail, might off myself
Bored with life as I board this plane

Maybe baby, what's your last name
Hopefully it still ain't been changed
Somethin' 'bout ya make me not doubt ya

Askin' when I'm gon' blast myself

Human issues, too strong for tissues

When death and destruction's all I see?

Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do

Deja vu from my bayside view
I see black cats in the daytime too
I see black cats on the daytime news
With handcuffed wrists and their skin turned blue
I met God once at a rendezvous and felt star-struck
""Vince, the car's out front""
Got things to do, got to make my moves
I can't miss my flight and miss you too, boo
First class seats is overrated
Won't go 'less they overpay us
Nowadays I'm overdatin'
My dick is strict for procreation
Her lips, my lips stay well acquainted
Her morning moanings is callin' me

All I need, all I need

Feels Like Summer,FM!,2018,"Big Boy!
Man, whatever day, vibe, month it is
It just feels like summer
You know what I'm saying?
It always feels like summer in the neighborhood, man
When you get a chance to come in
You get a chance to lay back
You get a chance to laugh
You get a chance to chill
Best believe that, man
And being that it always feels like summer
Let's go ahead and make you feel like summer

Summertime in the LB wild
We gon' party 'til the sun or the guns come out
JB first one fouled out playing ball
Now the whole city love you, how?
Boy we know they wasn't down from the get go
Dirty got a dozen rounds, better get low
Lil Johnny gave his life for this shit
All he got was a plot and a bottle from the Winco
Still North Side, Parkside, Vince though
Two N's, new friends, we skip those
Try finessin' my way into Heaven
Might hit that gate, might fall from grace
Splat, on the concrete, real street runner
First month still feel like summer
Cold weather won't stop no gunner
Wrong hat, wrong day, I'll kill my brother

Ayy, summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Scared money don't make money, hey
White man wan' take from me, hey
White fans at the Coachella, hey
Never been touched, niggas know better, hey (Ooh yeah)
Same ways since summer school, Baby J
Either I'ma make the news or make a play
Passed Alyssa house, could've took a different route
Wouldn't be without, think about her every day
Moved on, life fast like that
Still struggle with the past, I'm strapped
Somebody gotta watch my back
Everybody wanna count my bag
Ease off me, these streets taught me
Speak softly, please don't taunt me
Knew when Vicky 'nem stayed on eighth
If they killed me, then I'd be great
Now they lookin' at me

Summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy

Robert Longo, black as the Congo
Pay me pronto, or it's no convo

I'm on a new level
I am too cultured and too ghetto
If you knew better you'd do better
But then you would know why the world on my penis

Heaven or Hell, boy, freedom or jail, boy
A Jansport bag full of shit I could sell for
The high or the low, boy, just me and my homeboys
The police kill us so we made up our own laws
Been fighting this long war, there's shells in this shore's sand
Still young, but a grown man, could tell by my stature
Stacking money and problems as I wait for the rapture
Death never been no threat, I be chilling, relaxing
Everybody bleed

To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When I was in seventh grade, my grandfather told me, ""Don't get caught loving the streets, 'cause they never gon' love you back."" But I feel like it's all we got, so it's all we really do love.
 
At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from here. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us and all they see is a nigga.
 But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day
.

Do doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?
The young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost
Ho, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold
Just bar windows and six-fours with no switches
Was broke with no bitches; she love me, though
You'll kill me if it make you richer
What you screaming you my brother for?
Heart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain 
the love below
And life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really no better than me, walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody. 'Cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want for anybody is to not really have nothing at all
.

I been through Hell and back, I seen my momma cry
Seen my father hit the crack, then hit the set, then flip the sack
I done seen my homies die, then went on rides to kill 'em back
So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?
We live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass
No matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past
So in this cage they made for me exactly where you find me at
Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back

I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one

Versace Rap,Shyne Coldchain Vol. 1,2011,"I asked my mama what's the key to life, she told me she ain't know
She just try to take it day to day, and pray I make it home
Made me wonder for a second, til I felt my weapon
Falling out my pocket, then walked inside my room before she saw it
Never had a happy home, stability's a problem
Evictions from apartments, prison letters from my father
All a nigga ever knew, if it wasn't for Rashard or Ray
I probably would be shot today, they taught a loc survival
My teachers said I had a vibrant mind, but a tarnished shine
Doing violent crimes, put the money in my pockets
Gave it to my mom, but when a nigga had a chance
Never asked where it was from, happy that I lent a hand
The day my grandfather died, I grew into a man
Around the same time I first pulled a trigger
I prayed it didn't hit him, but after awhile I ain't care
As long as a nigga still here, right?

Never had belief in Christ, cus in the pictures he was white
Same color as the judge that gave my hood repeated life
Sentences for little shit, church I wasn't feeling it
Why the preacher charge tell us everything gon be alright
Knew what it was for, still I felt that it was wrong
Till I heard Chef call himself God in the song
And it all made sense, cus we can't do shit
But look inside the mirror once it all goes wrong
You fix your own problems, tame your own conscience
All that holy water shit is nothing short of nonsense
Not denying Christ, I'm just denying niggas options
Cus prayer never moved my Grandmama out of Compton
I prayed for my cousin, but them niggas still shot him
Invest in a gun, cause them niggas still got them
And won't shit stop em from popping you in broad day
Hope that choir pew bulletproof or you gon' pay

Money was the motive, Florence, California, cutting corners
Trying catch a nigga slipping just to blaze him that Sabonis (what?)
Chamber long as Tommy Chambers nigga meet your maker
As-Salamu leave em lakeside, bells can't save em
When them shells start raining, guess my mama didn't raise me right
Too busy paying Christ to wash away her sins
But I'm the only one that's fucked up in the end?
That's the shit that happens when you put a book before your kids
The only girl I ever loved turned into a bitch
If I ever see her and I got a gun, she getting hit
That's as honest as it gets, I've done a lot of shit
I ain't proud of, but I wouldn't trade it in for Heaven
11 Mac-11's, and a Tre 57
Bet that shit will get to talking if you ever got a question
Never met a person worth trying to impress
So consider this a murder when it's 5 inside your chest",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-versace-rap-lyrics

Just played me a show they paid 80k
I put it away for a rainy day
You never know when you gon catch a case
You never know when you gon catch an opp
We kill ever day like where Sosa stay
You might get a pass

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine
Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine

Big timer like Manny and Baby
Don't play with that man cause he crazy
With Demon and Ocho from Bompton
They stomping out niggas like Stacy
The radio never gon play me
I'll quit if my label don't pay me
I'll run up in there with my gun in the air screaming give me the shit you owe Jay Z
Bandana like Jayo from Daygos
My temper depend how my day go
My girl do whatever I say so
She ain't got no reason to say no
I ain't wish for nothing but hood rich
You ain't seen how grimey my hood get
I been on some up to no good shit
You on that Cuba from Boyz N da Hood shit
I go down to Cuba and find me a plug
Sick of these rappers not selling no drugs
Sick of this industry playing these games
Sick of my enemies saying my name
Harder than niggas since Hollister nigga
Ill body a nigga for saying I can't
You should have known I go hard in the paint
You should have known ain't no stopping my wave

Looking for the tents mama gotta pay the rent
Kicking in the back door tell me where it is
Come up out the safe or its coming out the clip
And I don't hesitate washing money like the sins
Attention getters hit detention centers
Before I break the bank, boy ill break and enter
Both ears to the streets listen in a drought

Might Be Wrong,Summertime 06,2015,"I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right (this time)
You tried to warn me, you swore it would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money
(Wouldn't you)
So for my life
Couldn't sleep at night, shoulda seen the crib though
So fucking nice

Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind
Justice is supposed to be blind
But continue to cross color lines
Hands up, don't shoot
You shot. 
Stand your ground
Blacks don't own no ground to stand on so we stand on our words
.
Black and hooded is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons drawn
I can't breathe through the chokeholds and gun smoke
These realities drift and appear to inform black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors
Slain in society by sworn protectors
Protected by their peers, grand juries full of friends
No charges brought against them
They kill and arrest us, transgress and oppress us.
 Damn, cuz

It don't even matter. You can start from the beginning...

I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right (this time)
You tried to warn me, you swore it would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money
(Wouldn't you)
So for my life
Couldn't sleep at night, shoulda seen the crib though
So fucking nice

They searching, they searching cells
Hold on cuz, (Oh it's the) there's police in this motherfucker, you ain't hear them?
You ain't hear the alarms?
Three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven
Another day in Ironwood

I might be wrong, might be guilty
You might be right (this time)
You tried to warn me, you swore it would kill me

Taxi,Shyne Coldchain Vol. 1,2011,"She was more beautiful than anything I've ever seen
Was the dream I had longed for, for many years
How it broke my heart to see her shed a tear
But she deserved it, I wasnt perfect, nah, I never been
So tell me why the Hell was you expecting that?
Bitching and complaining, seems to me like you perfected that
If I wouldve knew I would have never got so damn attached
Found out that she loves me not, now I'm in this Cadillac
Please dont panic pretty lady, I wont do no stupid shit
Just wanna be the one you love, one you hug, one you kiss
Its funny cause ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off
They say an un-tampered love is lost, so I'm not downing you
Really though, I'm happy that you found a dude, but anyway
Is the rope a little tight, it seems as if your wrists are bleeding
And I hope the tape around your lips doesn't constrict your breathing
Not much room, but the trunks filled actually
That's why I got you in the back seat, love taxi

That's why I got you in the back seat
No
Don't you know I love you so
So tell me why you wanna go
Don't leave me, alone
The screaming stopped, blood pouring from the razor slitting
But why the frown, you should be

Sitting here, loathing in this ambiance
Staring at this shrine of miscellaneous body parts
I think of how we got of to such a sloppy start
And which seems worse, a slit throat or a tarnished heart
I guess I got the raw end of the deal
Because this pain'll last forever, yours ended in shrills
Now my life's a nightmare, but it seems so real
Our love was full force, yet you chose to yield
So we crash, face first, blood on the dash
I guess the best lesson in life, is nothing will last
Fast forward to this fucked up position I'm in
Contemplating why to live when I'm living in sin
But shit, niggas like me wasn't meant to go to Heaven
We was meant to be alone, die hanging from a ceiling
Try praying for forgiveness, but God told me to shut up",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-taxi-lyrics

Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me

I want whatever that you want, let's get it brackin'
Ain't want that talk and bullshit, I want that action
I need it all up front, that's what I want
Play and get stomped, I get active
No, I cannot stay in, I go dumb outside
I keep my hand on a cup of ice
No, I'm with the shits, I pull up, I slide
When the drama's high, I pull homicide
Click, clack, bang, bitch, I stay dangerous
You can't be friendly when you gangin'
Pushin' hard lines, talkin' brass, bitch
Talkin' reckless all up on the net, bitch

Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on the swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me (Oh no, cuz)

Progressive III,Shyne Coldchain II,2014,"Yeah, back and blacker than ever
Got sick of waiting for these actors to get it together
Still in them gutters, all my brothers is birds of a feather
Tried to get this money cause my people done struggled forever
Son of my father, gunning for stardom, it's worth a shot
They hate me like I'm fucking their mama, that's why I serve 'em hot
Shells they burning, as long as hell is burning Ill murder God
If he was trying to fuck up my paper, nigga, that's all I got
The black and brown been going through a holocaust
You see Obama just a house nigga to me
They locked the children up in prison and they ditching the key
It's empty plates in this estate so shorty shit where he eat
He got a clip, he got a K, he bout to light up the street
They catch him slipping, now they trip him knock him right off his feet
His mama crying on the news like ''that boy was so smart
Wish he never start chilling with them niggas at the park''
Been swimming with the sharks since the kiddy pool
Breaking all the written rules
Breaking the tradition of that inner-city raising fools
A raisin in the sun
They let the monkey out the cage, he got a gun
He got a book, he got a brain, you better run
Was the one that they shun
Baptized in the tears of the slaves as a young
A penny saved is a penny earned
So I'll be stacking up this copper as the city burn
Cold chain, nigga

Yeah, just sit and look at where they raised us at
Seen blacks ain't crack, so they gave us that
Give us hope then take us back
To the 1800's with these rap contracts
And they wonder why niggas get shot, coke sit in the pot
He can't get no job so he hitting the block
And if that nigga getting money while them niggas sitting hungry
Ten times out of ten bet them niggas gon' plot
We just struggle with survival trying to rise to the top
When your life is on the line fuck what's right and what's not
You got a right to the dream, whether it's triple beam or Martin Luther's
My chain heavy, is you ready for that revolution?",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-progressive-iii-lyrics

Camoflage Hummer gang, interior by Dr. Seuss
Gold dust, gold chain you knew I had to rock the noose
Just a nigga anyway, Emmett Till semi spray
But I pack a right hook only Robin Givens knew
Knock him out, paramedics had to use the Pikachu
Who invited sharks to the neighborhood swimming pool?
Sellin' streebo out of Deebo's pigeon coup-
Deville, ""Ooh he ill"" is what the bitches say
That'll put your dick away, bullets tend to ricochet
Padlocks say Shawn Kemp had a flat top
Trynna sell this Richard Pryor autographed magic box
I might trade for a harpoon or a sasquatch
A two-tone do-rag or a Matlock DVD, flip hoes no TLC
Sell PCP to minors
Sherm by the boatload, perm from the soul glow 
Closest that I ever been to church was the pollo
No one out there can fuck with me Prodigy

I wrote this verse on my way to church
Rifle and the autographed Bible in the backseat
Life is like a track meet: When you hear them shots better run nigga
Cause I got that motherfucking gun nigga
Drug-dealer, crime rates run in the family
Juvenile felon so I'll never go the Grammy's
Who cares? Rather drive drunk bumpin' some Brandy
Going hard in the paint like I'm Olowokandi
Say, ""Hi"" to the big black forty when it click-clack
Push a nigga's wig back, pray for his family
Catch his mom slippin' turn him to Bambi
Prolly slam it like Camby, cocaine flow
Hoes propane blow, Peggy Hill
All my weapons kill come and test it nigga

By the way, mixtape December 30th...you're welcome

I'm that shit Frankie Lymon was stuffing up his arms
Firearms snuck in the luggage just for the fuck of it
I'm who would be runnin' shit if Jason took a day off
Cruisin' with that Tommy Gun, rip a nigga's face off
Vanilla Sky, got 'em high, Glock named Paula
Sit inside of my tinted ride I squeeze it she be moanin'
Kelly Slater trynna rock the top, sharks start swarmin'
Now you stuck in deep water with a smooth barracuda
Custom Bape, German Lugers levitate, meet your maker
Masturbate, let 'em mace ya
Bitch so she can grade in greatness, Sick cum
Guard-dog swag, but never bit none
Your bitch cunt, ask her where she got that shit from",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-queensbridge-zoo-lyrics

Black heart and matching weapons
Got a thing for aesthetics
Straight shooter like Redick
We get to dukin' and that Gloc-32
Pull a Laettner at the buzzer
You a dead motherfucker
Hunt heads motherfucker
My momma told me I'm living crazy
I'm just being what she made me
Dealing with the luck she gave me
Money comes and money goes
The money's low, We run in homes
Only leave the garden gnomes
Take the racks from out the stove
Stunting ain't no habit
If I want, I grab it
Selling tablet's like Toshiba, Nigga
In my city, We the killa's
If you pull that trigger, Better squeeze it nigga
If you don't
Then we 'gon have to find your house, And fucking Christmas tree it nigga
Light it up
Cops roll up
Hide the drugs
I never been to prison, And I never plan on showing up
Never could be rich enough
Cause I grew up broke as fuck
So I'll never stop my stroll
X by the O
All for the love of dough

Until I get my 97
Benz, I'm selling dope
So get a quote
The trap is open, Nigga
Everything's a go
I'd be lying if I told you that we got it on the low
But we got it out the 'do
If you need it let me know

What you nigga's know about
40's out?
Run up in somebody house
If they home, Then swing that chrome
Knock his baby momma out
Fuck what you be talking 'bout
We really bring these chopper's out
Like Fox 11
Harmful weapons
Tell your girlfriend
Call the Reverend
Tell that pussy nigga talking
Only leave his momma grieving
Never been to prom, So he can slow dance with this Desert Eagle
Understand my grind is crooked
TK with an SK
Load off one mag
In your car dash
Like an Armean with a sextape
Nigga, I'm Heem
I'm Heem
My wave green, Like Tulane
See more drugs than 2 Chainz
Talk more shit, Than two Ye's
Hall of fame shooter
Wig scuffing, Six buffing
And my threat is a promise
I ain't one bit bluffing
I'm in one big room filled with abused substance

Feelin the Love,Hell Can Wait,2014,"I wake up tryin' to dodge the cops just like my momma did
Came home from school soon as I seen she was up out the crib
Criminal Minded, mind your business if you wanna live
Them niggas fiendin' for them luxuries they'll never get
I took a couple women's love for me and hit a lick
If she can't help me get up out the struggle, why I need the bitch?
I need a million dollars for starters, been sick of sleepin' on the couch
In this crowded apartment, them streets been in a fuckin' drought
I don't see the narcotics, it ain't no books up in this backpack
I brought the revolver, I'm asking niggas where the cash at
Tappin' they pockets
That pocket rocket make a backpacker as soon as you blockin'
You know the block is hot
Wayne tried to tell them
, one case away from felon
Granny told me stay inside the house, a nigga should've listened
Been punchin' out their faces with the hands that I pray with
Money trees blowin' in the wind, I'm feeling the fragrance

Is you feeling amazing? Yeah I'm feeling the love
Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done
Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done
And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come
Yeah I'm feeling the love
Yeah I'm feeling the love
Yeah I'm feeling the love
Yeah I'm feeling the love
Yeah I'm feeling the love
Yeah I'm feeling the love
Yeah I'm feeling the love

2006 I said I had to get my money right
Shit I refuse to hear my stomach growl another night
Might put that burner right up in your mouth and free your mind
Then run your pockets, I ain't stoppin' 'til my kids is fine
College was a plan of mine until I seen them fees
Everything I ever needed, I done learned out on them streets
Only price was loss of sleepin', homies plottin' so I keep it on me
Closely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie
Goals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep
Mom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave
Then this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds
Is what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen?
Played a lot of roles in life but never played the victim
Never paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights
Mac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist
Life is what you make it, just depend on how you roll the dice

Is you feeling amazing? Yeah I'm feeling the love
Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done
Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done
And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come

Earth Science,Shyne Coldchain II,2014,"Bitches born with shovels
Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman
Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you
Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror
You took a chance and I appreciate it
Understand that over time our word depreciated
But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when
Give it time and a place swear to god I'll attend
I should've took you to prom
Fuck whoever had did but I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym
And you was right there, you was always right there
Forwarding your calls thinking how we got here

But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you

Remember walking to your house everyday of the week
Nothing else I had to do and you was something to see
Red rose tattooed right up under your jeans
Still text you every night before I wander to sleep
Never told you this but you was why I went to seventh period
Truant student but you told me I should take it serious
Losing you is just another demon that I'm living with
Standing in your living room meeting your fam'
Know it hurt you when they ask you what had happen to him
When you see me on the t.v. know I'm glad you're my friend
Wish I had more but I don't
Never running out of hope really I'm just waiting on you

But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you

As for you I always think about our kids that you killed
Understanding at the time you didn't think we was real
But as a man I feel I let you down, we was on our second child
That you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile
It make you see the way I try to plan for us all
When I look back at my life I'm glad I had you involved
If I ever need somebody you the first imma call
Said that you would do it all just to see me alive
In the back seat, steel beats, tears in your eyes
Told me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie
But whatever help you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away
Sorry if you called me and I tell you I can't talk today
Pain in my voice when I speak in these songs
Same tone as the day I told you leave me alone

But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
No, I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you
I never said",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-earth-science-lyrics
Trunk Rattle,Shyne Coldchain II,2014,"My momma cried the day I got put on the hood
Never wished for better days, only wished a nigga would
Never been a pump faker, that won't do your boy no good
Still shoot it like a free throw
, hammers that the cheat codes get
Daddy threw it off the glass like a bank shot, shit
I'm just trying to get the money that the bank got flip
Like a monster truck, banging never disturbed me
That's the only time I see niggas balling without a jersey
At apartments we used to loot, them Poppy niggas'll shoot
Homies taught me 2N's ain't need no friends
I need a black Panamera with the black 2-10's
Told my momma I would make it so the story begins
Begins

Trunk rattle like a body in that bitch
Catch a body in this bitch, check the body on my bitch
Mafuckas talkin' shit til' you show up where they live
Mafuckas talkin' shit til' you show up where they live, nigga
Got a whole lot of problems at the crib
Got a chopper at the crib since I hopped up out the crib, nigga

Tell me what's the deal, I'm trying to make a mil or somethin'
Tell me how you feel, these haters want to hunt us
So it's cameras in the crib, cock hammers in the whip
Champagne for the pain, gram stacked up in the spliff
Blow the back out on the bitch who only want you for the dough you got
We know they know you know, but still, we got them hoes up in the spot
Getting hot and bothered sinning in this sign of smoke
I put that on my momma, not a nigga living that stop the show
Promise that we did it way before we ever heard of rap
Niggas say they shooters, where your jersey at?
We catch you where you lurking at
Been to hell and church and back,
 all in granny Cadillac
Matter fact she had that Eldorado parked on Colorado
Called us if she had a problem, cousin Jerry had it rockin'
Back when Common had you tryna to read Qu'rans and go to college
But forget about it

Trunk rattle like a body in that bitch
Catch a body in this bitch, check the body on my bitch

Can't get passed them pearly gates, neglecting what your pastor taught
But you gon' smoke your weed still and you gon' sip your lean still
So I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison
Doing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby
My temper short, that anger made me have days in court
In my hood spill blood a sport and the killer's face can show no remorse
Got student loans and you failed the course
Of course you dropped out like 6 am and you see the cops out
Niggas been turnt up, no need to stop now
Speed up, skeet up then air the block out
El Camino creeping with your homies in your backseat
Once you hit that corner watch them niggas turn to athletes
Make him run his pockets, take his wallet then his house keys
Staking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing

And God who made my life this hard so hell where we decide to go
Could you really judge us knowing us then close to what was given
Father up in prison, Jesus here, but he ain't struggle wit us
The church only made shit worse
The money we was given ain't go to God
Mostly nice cars that Reverends could sit in, 
destined for jail
We just some niggas facing sentence, we sitting at a standstill
You broke, but you the man still trying to find your plan still
Two kids and mo' bills, food stamps and dope deals, hood life with no frills
But still they swear they feel you and never been close to near you
Ones who preach protect and serve, the main ones trying to kill you
It ain't no path to life, no prepping for no afterlife
It ain't no wrong or right, it's just the shit you do and shit you don't

Ditching my alma mater
Made a lot of mistakes from mimicking ways of my father

Back when grandaddy died, that was a cold December
They closed his casket while my motherfuckin hope was in it
Soon as you come out the womb they hanging rope for niggas
Groomed for the stone and the tomb, going for broke and shit
We've been that, push shit back, the Devil coaching niggas
Telling 'em to shoot, like a title on the line
When it's judgment time I doubt that God can look me in my eyes
'Fore He send me down to Hell cause I'mma ask a Nigga Why?
Never played it by the book because the Book was full of lies
And the preacher full of shit, and the teacher full of shit
Used to boo me from the bleachers that I'm never gon' forget
Eating $5 Little Caesar's pizzas on the WIC
Cause my daddy left my momma for the motherfucking pen

But when it come down to it, know I'm out here shooting
Cause it's all a nigga got
Yeah that's all a nigga got
When it come down to it know the basehead use it
Cause it's all a nigga got
Yeah that's all a nigga got
Find me posted on the block, cause it's all a nigga got
Couple hundred in the knot, cause it's all a nigga got
Still running from the cops
Cause it's all a nigga got (x2)

Our Father who art in heaven
Seen my momma dying every day since grade 11
You see her age is catching up to all them years of stressing
Tears is falling and her son too far away to catch 'em
Hard to call and when she call she gotta leave a message
Cause a nigga working
And I'm working so she worry free, guess I defeat the purpose
Medication cost a arm and leg, hardly even worth it
Doctor tripping so it got a nigga feeling John Q, wild
Round sitting in the gun, duck duck goose style
Pressure building up, nigga, what you gonna do now?
Brother kid 2 now, 12 years in the pen
Seen life end 'fore this shit begin
Sing it then

I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you

White high school's wasn't laughing at the black jokes
Daddy had us contact high off of crack smoke
Had to get it cracking with the 7 cause the Mac broke
Wrist fucked up, couldn't make it to practice
Had the money in the couch and the K's by the mattress
Chasing senior bitches down cause we was hanging with Pac then
Sidekick thefts, if he pressed him we packed him
Ski masking, but niggas wasn't going to Aspen
Mayfair freshman class, but I skipped them all
But Miss Brown cause that was my nigga
Ask me what had mattered more, the school or the set?
She can tell by the truancy I'm true to the shit
Couple months I was up out of there
Mama kicked me out of the house, but shit I didn't care
Hitting licks, it came to a drought, so we was killing kids all for the buck
15, sitting shotgun, ready to dump

Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit
I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you

I swear I'm busy every time my mama call my phone
No time for stressing, she can leave a message at the tone
I apologize for breaking up your happy home
And looking like my daddy, all them arguments was overblown
Girl, I just want you happy, that's the reason why I write these songs
Cause I can give a fuck 'bout where I end up when it's said and done
Riding down 7 Street, looking for your second son
Found him on Artesia with a Yankee hat and loaded gun
But you ain't know the difference, coming home late
Seen Tyson in the kitchen trying to make his own plate
But you love my homies like you love your only son that walk and talk
Think that was the reason you afraid to see me risk it all
But your father told me no reward if it's no risk involved
And your father raised me, made me crazy, don't take shit at all
I know you miss him cause I miss him more than I can quite recall
Knew he would be happy as the day my mama had me, see

Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit
I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped

I treat you faggots like I'm Tim Hardaway

What these so called dues that I gotta pay?
Old niggas scared cause the new niggas got the Ks beat
Key Nyata made, caught the body, caught the case
Big poppa pump, pop the trunk, blow a cop away
They soft as Petey Pablo helicopter blades
Choppin blades, like I'm pimping Chad
'97 slab(s), Saab 9000, color of Spinelli hat
Straight out the deli with that big Mac 11
And it's for the beef shreddin'. John Lennon of my fucking trap
Can you roger that, Roger Mayweather hands hard
Hitting when I go to bat, you niggas notice that


Never fuck with niggas who can point out where your momma live
The shooters, cause 9  times out of 10, you lose her
That murder ain't a thing, got the Shawn Kemp Ruger
At the trap off Hoopa, fully loaded when I shoot it
Feel that loud hadouken ho, real trill, you should know
Since my days at optimal academy
Picture like Maddux with a magnum in the black Ford Galaxy
I hope he rages, ain't no point in dodging when I grab the 3
Shoot the 3, Reggie Miller 93, 31, 32
Harold Miner quick release, run and shoot

Once you leave so I've been trying to live forever, dawg
I got a .25 Beretta in my mama car
Same one my brother used, same one my father bought
Everybody telling when they go to court
I'm feeling like they don't make niggas like me no more
I still got slaves hanging from my family tree
The young still gangbanging like we WC
And Mac 10, Mac 10's sit up under the fleece
Because the powers that be insist on fucking with me
Since back when there was white men under them sheets
Riding horseback, walking on the backs of the free
You see we in it to survive, what the fuck did you think?
At the blink of an eye niggas could die in these streets

My life a movie, hope you liking the show
They act, we shooting, just a part of the role
The road to riches wasn't made for niggas this low
I pray for blessings, grab my weapon when I walk out the do'
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
When I'm ready to go, when I'm ready to go

Aye, tell these niggas let the black man shine
This little light of mine, a nine I hide inside of my drawers
Ain't nothing Aunt Jemima, aye lil mama ain't I a star?
I only pray when asking  Allah how we made it this far
But still I'm all about the dollar, pass the offering jar
The thoughts of niggas at the bottom what I offer to y'all
We from the slaveship, all my niggas ride for the cause
We on the same shit, tryna survive all the laws
Because they ain't shit, won't take shit but the charge
Because we can't snitch, 
know you niggas heard it before
The child was murdered before, he had a chance to mature
And bet the one they did it never see outside of the bars

I believe that the world got black neglect
Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks
Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet
County blues, counting days till you get set free
Broke the rules so they shoot now we R.I.P
Live and learn what you earn when you cross them streets
Caught a case cause he wouldn't catch a fade
Living pedal to the metal cause he couldn't catch a break
Couldn't see the stakes, couldn't see the trouble come his way

Fuck the other side, show them niggas that you with the shit
Fucking homicide, let 'em see my ass upstate
Know they love to see me rattle sitting in that cage
Cause when some drugs get in the battle bet you lose all faith
I was born with a heart that the streets can't break
Never poured one shot, never rolled one J

Abraham Lincoln never kept none of my niggas safe
Only gave them prison dates and Church's Chicken dinner plates
Columbus is beloved, when the fuck will Malcolm get a day?
Probably never, try to hide the truth, but they hardly clever
Only show the youth house niggas wearing Cosby sweaters
Wisdom scripted in the prison letter's that my father sent us
Waiting for Armageddon, still slangin' that Arm & Hammer
Use them cops as target practice, they owe us a couple L's
How we gon' know the future when we barely know ourselves?
It ain't hard to tell the nigga's got it hard as hell

Yes sir, baby girl ill
Got me feeling unreal like I popped that pill
Neo-Nazi, killer body
I think I love ya, prolly
But I don't even know ya
I tapped you on your shoulder, asked your name
You gladly told me, then you asked the same
I told you I was Vince
And you said you heard about me well I hope you didn't listen
Thought that I should mention, that you my perfect vision
Remind me of the middle school days when I couldn't wait to get to class
Just so I could fall asleep and dream about your pretty ass
So baby we can go far, but its up to you...

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay, the night with me?
And girl it's up to you...

Yeah... look...first name crystal, last name amazing
Stars in my mind really got my heart racing
They say I shouldn't rush, that I should pace the situation
But these feelings in my head has got me feeling impatient
You could say this love thing has got my heart aching
Even if it's waiting, when she say that she is taken
All options open, so I keep my doors vacant
I know that she baking, off this shit I'm making
Thinking that it break in, hoping that it break out
Lights all on, you taking pictures with your face out
Full on platters where waiters bring the steaks out
But how can I leave, when there's no one else to take out
And I know it ain't my business...
But I just thought that I should mention...
That you know what I'm missing, so don't sit there
And try to act like you don't feel this...


Come summer time we was just relaxing
Swear that she was bad like the youngest of the Jackson's
The perfect imperfections, the first of my selection
Baby got drive, never asking for directions
She know she ain't my only, but she know just where the rest is
Young but never restless, she was losing lighter sleep
Cause she know when its said and done she gon' be right with me
Bonnie Clyde type shit, nice thighs, nice hips
Mind right, my type, my love, my life
My girl, my wife, couldn't say it better
Story board love, tell me who can play it better?
Shit gets stormy, we'll escape the weather
Her umbrella's up when them time's looking tough
Prolly wish we stop, but I can't get enough
So baby we can make this a forever thing
I'm talking 'bout, house, kids, cars, and wedding rings

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay the night with me?

Fuck the pigs alive and dead 'cuz they ain't never had my back
They see you black 'fore you a man, and you a nigga 'fore you that
And that you'll never understand if you done seen it second hand
You ain't ready for that war then please don't step across them tracks
Rent money low and pressure high, no sellin O's just selling dimes
These California sunny skies done looked down on me all of my life
Is you really bout' what you write? Know they waitin' on my demise
And I been waiting too, my patience through, blue paisley noose in the sky


Martin Luther had a dream, I thought Tookie dream was better
Bunchy Carter had a plan, but they shot him 'fore he led us
To that Ghetto Promise Land, it ain't no hope for the darker man

When them the niggas that made me

They say I sold my soul, When I never had it in the first place
Hades was my birthplace
Crazy is the word they
Used to describe my tactics
Of Islam practice
Mixed with my mother's lies

Before I end up deceased
Ain't no need to reply
When I ask them ""Who's fucking with me?""
Cause I know the answer, Nigga
No love for the Devil
But for the moment, I'm dancing with her
Just trying to get my money up, So that I can pay for my brothers
Cause at the moment they banging, No point in killing each other
But I feel this shit's a struggle and all
That's one of the main reasons I'm not fucking with y'all

Went to sleep pissed off, woke up broke as fuck again
Being mediocre is some shit I'll never understand
Never had a 9 to 5, never did an application
And rather rob a nigga, when I get the chance, teacher's tell you
""Get a plan, go to college, let them empty out your pockets""
What the fuck I look like, nigga? For real
It's safe to say I put my heart in the trap but
How in the hell could you fault me for that when
It takes money to be shit and we never seen it
So I'm doing dirt, let the police clean it
Standing on the edge of a tall cliff
Trying not to fall deep into the shark pit
I guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way
Can't wait to see my life change once the money came

Niggas only come around when the money's 'round
Catch you slipping 'round the town just to gun you down
Wasn't fucking with me then but I bet by now
These mothafuckas know they like my style
Tryna figure out, What the hell they want from me
Why I love everything that involves money?
Hope I get enough just tryna live it up
Shit I want yours too, you should give it up

She said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?
Just another disappointment in my fucking day
Slave to my lifestyle, would try and make a change
But I heard about the shit they doing to the runaway's
Swear that I would change everything if my gun could stay
Said she doesn't understand, anything I fucking say
Problems with women, she's tripping but get's pissed
Cause I tell that she just a bitch, and never really meant much
But if I told you that I loved you would you give a fuck?
Or even have the decency to listen up? Probably not
I swear like every time you come around my fucking heart will stop
Can't wait 'til I make way and the talking stops
But for now I just stare you down in the parking lot
From a far distance, just hoping, just wishing
That maybe you might not think I'm crazy

Say man, are we gonna start doing what they doing?
You know, same thing they do to us we do to them
And would you believe but he had to, you know
Either do or die, or stay in the house
You know, fight or stay in the house
So I wasn't gon' stay in the house for nobody

I ain't never really care about shit
Soon as my father abandoned his kids
I was down for the problems
I promised my momma
I wasn't gonna die, so I got this revolver
Hammers will heal what a fist can't fix
Won't get down I'ma sent 'bout six
Ain't no questions, I'm wit' that shit
On the highway to hell but it still ain't jail
Gotta plug and a scale, tryna make this money
Crooked ass police tryna take this from me
Either watch yo step, or you catch that weap

Tell my momma don't trust not a soul that she meet
9 times outta ten niggas just like me

But why try when they tryna take a nigga under
Spend a thousand every time a nigga make a hundred
And they wonder why I'm wild when I'm out in public
Demons form in the presences of nothing but struggle
It's easy to hustle when knowing nobody love you
Ain't nothing to lose, this money to gain

Sitting in the rain wit' a Glock nine
Waiting for the bus on Ximeno

Roaches in the hallway, sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

If 1st and 2nd Corinthians, could give a nigga spinnin' rims
Or Christina Milian, I'd prolly give that shit a chance
Coulda went the college route, but I chose the nigga plan
Broken heart sitting on my path, try and watch my step
God blessed the child with a gift then he turned his back
Told him choose his own way, guess I chose the wrong way
But it's only one way, either wit' the gunplay
Or you getting dumped on, nigga ain't a soul safe
I live my life as if a nigga could get killed tonight
Niggas running at they mouth like they wanna die
I ain't the passive nigga most would probably wanna try
In the land of the lost only the strong survive

In a four door Jeep that's 400 degrees

I told them niggas my feature price
Music mean nothing to me if I ain't eating right
Momma told me better see the light before they cut him off
Fuck what's wrong and right, if it's a gun involved
Then I'm drumming off, nigga
Ricky Ricardo going where only God knows
Beating the block, I'm feeding the block
They want us all broke, women getting they heart broke
Prison is where our dads call home
So we don't see 'em in our homes
But nigga we from Long Beach
So Dre and Eazy never been our heros
And California niggas that see plays is weirdos
Lying like a mothafucka
Soon it's gon' be niggas dying like a mothafucka
Fry 'em like a mothafucka
I'm sick in my thoughts and sick in my soul
Never let a bitch in my heart nor a bitch in my home
Why care about a broad when all my family gone
So til' they free the packs fuck true love, I don't believe in that
You run your mouth then I'm meeting that
I won't tweet you back, I'll just see you black out
And leave you passed out, bleeding and shit
Feeding them clips, I'm the Hollow Man
Take a nigga life, he ain't got no plans
We anybody killing, we ain't got no friends (no friends)
Now back to the story at hand
They handed me nothing, I took it in stride
Take a shot at your head for taking shots at my pride
The only son my momma got that she can talk to
So you don't want no problems
That's never been a smart move",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-winter-in-prague-lyrics
Waterpark,Winter in Prague,2011,"Yeah nigga I'm out here shining
You see me bitch, I don't see you though
Fake ass, fraud ass rap niggas
You on Twitter though, where you hiding at?
I'ma find you, little word of advice bitch nigga, don't sleep!

Heavy Duty shots out the Uzi into your momma house
Clip your momma on the couch
Now your momma running out the back door
Car-bomb strapped to her black Ford
Won't make it out the hospital tonight
You see I try to be a civil dude but bitches can get it too
Lying to the Johnny's like these rappers do in interviews
It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach
It'd be smart to keep 380's where you sleep
I need a bitch like Brandy
We can make a baby in the Jeep
She's drove me crazy since ""Moesha""
I'd really like to meet you
Niggas asking me for features
But nobody's talking monetary
Probably the reason why you never hear me

Tell all the girls clap your hands, you coming out of them pants
I don't ask or make demands, I'm the mothafuckin' man
Can somebody tell them broads, they coming out of them draws
I swear to God I love you all, where my round of applause at
We cashing all checks, don't call the laws yet
My niggas dogs, no need to get them involved
Cause them guns come out like the summertime sun
Yeah them guns come out like the summertime

I'm taking niggas bitches like Bowser
I pound her, you hound her
I never been sympathetic for simping
These niggas act like the women they crying over
Invite her over, dig her out then kick her out
Raw dog her then dog her, don't call until them kids is out
See I take a different route with everything I do
Where some little shit to me could be like everything to you
You could give a wedding ring to a girl you'll never screw
And I apologize for that, it must suck to be a fool
I'm tactical, been cracking hoes since secondary school
We trapping hoes, selling 4 and 5's for the price of 2
I was taught that the life you live is the life you choose
I chose the path of a winner, now shake that ass for a nigga",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-waterpark-lyrics

Ask Vinyan, them my two big sisters
With my big black fist with them blisters in it
From that wood grain whip, but the wheel keep spinnin'
And the world keep turnin', and my Blacks keep burnin'
At the stake, but we still talkin' 'bout gettin' paid
Talkin' 'bout fuckin' hoes, talkin' 'bout what you bang
Talkin' 'bout Crips and Bloods, talkin' 'bout where you from
Talkin' 'bout what you did like somebody give a shit

Tell the police where he live, but won't show your brother love

If my black life matters, mothafucka stop the killin
If my black life matters, mothafucka stop snitchin'
If my black life matters, mothafucka start business

If my black life matters then respect our women
If my black life matters don't neglect our children
If my black life matters, if the police take my shit with a pistol
Don't march, go kill 'em, lil nigga, you's a bitch
All these lights, all these drones, what you Star Wars, homes?
In your True Religion jeans, ain't no star wardrobe
You ain't runway ready, you ain't gunplay ready
God real and he comin', hope you Sunday ready
I never drove one Chevy, I went Beamer to Mercedes
My mama had a beeper sellin' reefer in the 80s
Levis and A Wang, still from the A gang
Used to be at rallys back when Stormy was my main thing
Had a .22 in the 
TK Crew
 fleece
.22 in the TK 
flew
Had a .22 in the TK Crew fleece
Used to have depression, used to have a couple mood swings
Real shit, now I'm on some bottom of the deal shit
Not here now, a nigga not here now
But guarantee a nigga goin' on, write four rhymes
Every night, on my knees I pray
My next girl look like M.I.A
And my enemies die like Kennedys
We by any means tryna get paid
Niggas in the rap game tryna get slaved
Niggas in this rap game all bitch made
Do it for the fame, I do it for the fam
If rap don't work, I'ma do it with the blam
That tre-5 jam, I'ma do it with my hands
Tears, sweat, blood, I'ma get it out the mud
That's on everything, that's on everything a nigga love
Mothafuckin' catch a slug tryna buzz on the Norf side

I got two drums like a nigga James Brown

Now my niggas stuck in here, so what we love it here
The drugs is here, the guns is here
Our mothers here, we run it here
The police lookin for me, they gotta come in here
A vicious cycle controlled, the pigs runnin the show
You think these guns just get dropped off at the door?
But I'mma still shoot, cause these days if you ain't gonna spray then
Somebody gonna kill you

My grandmother said we outta asthma medication
But get ready for school, still, cause hell is waitin
If you dont learn shit, you won't be shit
And that would probably mean shit
If they tried and teach kids during the class
Gotta a heart made of gold, knuckles smothered in brass
The snakes lay where you play, so I stray from the grass
Mind already troubled enough
So don't confuse my cruel actions for givin' a fuck
I show no love, parents didn't give me enough
Its too late now, I barely even like bein' touched
My girl stopped givin' me hugs, says I don't see her that much
But I just prefer bein' alone, because..

They running out of prescriptions
Mentally demented emotions are non-existent
Mother contemplating if this could've been prevented
Feeling like the blame for a child turnin' sadistic
Well, really?
You can blame it all on the Ritalin and Zoloft
That had me seeing Satan in my playpen
Family, I hate them
They prayers never did shit
Fuck is God supposed to understand
The pain he never had to deal with
Hell: he never been there
But forced me to live in
Don't ask me why I'm sinning
Cus I feel that nigga owe me one to tell the truth
Either be the victim or the first to shoot
Grab the Ruger and a clip or two
I want this ballad to be played at my funeral service
For a child, 17, whose brutally murdered
By himself, tortured for years
The one voice nobody ever wanted to hear
So, the ones inside of his head had to take control
God wouldn't take my soul, if that shit was free of charge
Satan neither, I need a breather from all this breathing
Grab a trigger and squeeze it

Gave it up on the first date, now she fucked in the worst way

She was cute, was only tryna fuck her though
But I broke the rules, so now I gotta come for hoes
Told her from the jump, that I wasn't into loving hoes
And she wouldn't be any different from my other hoes
Since a young nigga, I knew she would become a hoe
Eighth grade year, sucking dick behind the bungalows
Daddy had a bunch of dough, paid her no attention
Only paid the whole tuition, gave her extra cash for spending
She was fiending for the type of life she wasn't given
Hanging with them shady niggas in and outta prison
Thought a baby was the perfect way to keep his interest
Soon aborted when she saw he wasn't fucking with it
Cold nigga, gut checked, but she rolled wit it
Packed up, left home, took her soul wit him
Now it seems that she's only good for one thing
The one thing that we all need
Eyes dry, but her heart bleed

To sit us in the cell, so we givin niggas hell
Ship it, zip it, sit it on a scale
Do it in reverse though
Fuck being broke, its way too commercial

Bodies on the waterfront, washed another hurt soul
Never gave a fuck though

But if I empty a clip
I'll still be empty as shit
Fuck all that sympathy shit
Find where my empathy went
Just wish you would leave me alone
Then I start righting my wrongs
Probably stop writing these songs
Now all this pressure is on
Standing in the midst of the fire
Just turn my back on the world

Sizzurp,Verses II ,UnKnown,"My father said women only listen when you hit 'em
Gun to my momma head, sitting in the kitchen
I'm sorry I ain't the perfect kinda nigga
I tried to fix it, but nobody listened so I'm chillin'
My only dream is that I die before I make a million
Either that or take a L for dealing cause I'm trapped out
Tryna build a  castle from the crack house
Running out of rocks so I'm stuck to the stones, they've thrown at me
Nine times out of the ten I'm not happy
9th grade dreaming of Benz's that we'll never get
Banging for the hell of it, did it cause we wasn't scared to die
Just afraid to grow up and be something

They gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga

I guess y'all fucked with the wrong nigga
Ex girls hating on me, police bangin' on me
See they just a bigger gang, but that shit's a different story
Living on the highest story, hoping I don't fall too hard
Saying ""Yo, don't ball too hard"", selling dope is not a job
Is what I tell myself everyday, but it's hard to stop
Kinda like I'm using, making use of all this time I bought
The rounds you fought were rounds I shot
See the police coming, run around the block
Ain't no need for court, we black so we already lost
Power to the people, seven rounds up in this eagle
Birds baths for your bitch ass

But they gon' love you when you gone nigga
They always love you when you gone nigga
Yeah they gon' love you when you gone nigga
Nigga

I bring pain, watch my .45 flame
Drive-by's, while I ghostride  Cam'ron's range
Bang like Jerome Lane, 3 or 4 K's, and a Kevlar underneath the 'Lo Chambray
Niggas gon' try me, I'ma blast they brains
Shotty's all I need, Cobain, coldchain
What's rap these days? Niggas running with the police
We gunning with the police,  Daytons on the gold jeep
Ride solo, cause nigga's known to squeal
Up in that glass room, singing like soul for real
Still, I made a promise to my momma that I'd never go to jail
So a nigga won't, burning shells, 'til I burn in hell
Had to double up my personnel for the clientele
Nigga's want it coming off the scales and need the sales
Pack a zip and ship it in the mail like report cards
And they said we wasn't gon' go far, yeah right

But they gon' love you when you gone nigga, right?",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-sizzurp-lyrics
Fire In The Booth,UnKnown,2015,"Remember we had them nextels booming
They won since day one, hard knock students
We was stupid with our quick to shoot it out
Whats the drama to a nigga with no father
Just a mama and she using now
 Jewish now, bitches stupid now, take it down
All she know is clothes and the candy for her nose
Love these hoes, hope I never get a daughter of my own
Karma always had a crazy way of hitting close to home
We was hitting homes, 'fore that we was hitting phones
Kodac had us sitting  stationed, couple niggas told
Hold that burner to his dome, if he move then let it go
Ice cold mothafucka should have froze
Yeah, my first job was Def Jam records
Married to Ramona, best man, my Berreta
Blood on my Margielas from a wig and you ain't tripping nigga
Had the homies go and kill a nigga, really cripping nigga
Carnivores, used to drive unlisted Accord
With the a pistol in the door and a stick on the floor
Ready for War, pray to the Lord for more food stamps
Since them new  'til I seen Crime Pays
All gas no breaks, no off days or off switch
Fast life got me nauseous, I lost it
Money wild, start to see it, start to see the changes
Started wearing name of Queen and started leaving niggas hanging

Prayer couldn't save me from my sinning
Once I seen my Granny gun I knew I had to get me one
Seen the dirty money rose and wonder where she got it from
April of 2004, remember when it all begun
When we borrowed Grandaddy Caddy tryna make a run
Jerry caught a bullet in the mouth before the Pistons won
Seen them pile one by one in my Aunt Nina car
Came back; eyes blood shot, red beating heart
Something in a nigga man, I knew I had to be apart
Always let 'em see ya eyes but never said ""we see ya heart""
Couple lessons I was taught by my people coming up
Weak niggas die in the street nigga, toughen up

This ain't my first car ride with 
Been in the hands of the law, niggas lost
They don't know that you pawns to the plan of the man
.32 in my draws, catch me with it if ya can
Candle lights in the hood every night in the hood
We don't fight in the hood, hide the nine in the hood of the car
If you ain't got no license to push through the streets
Where the scared don't eat, should I wet my feet
When I turned thirteen in these Long Beach streets
Heard the deuce deuce ring at a Lakewood game
And I send back three, nigga had no aim but they knew 'bout me
Pulling out that thing, scare the stewl out beef
Call the 911 cause I got that gun
Know my time gon' come when my past catch me
So I live life fast tryna catch this green

 tube socks, two straps, two Glocks
Hop out and knock on yo' block
I'm from Ramona, bang that shit around the corner get shot
Been running fades since baby Jordan days 
Sporting waves, ain't caught no cases, blame my mama .38
Might die for this shit nigga
Four five with no clip in it
Bus rides for them licks nigga
Fuck school, I can take your shit quicker
Lil bro  drunk off hard liquor
Come through, better bring your god witcha
, gangster crip and we move for real
No hesitation, that medication the homies deal
Got smokers chilling off 68
Hoes walking down Artesia still
Make baby bank and might catch a case
 catch a  just catch a flip
And then do the business like  would say

Cuz, pussy only get a pussy nigga side-tracked
I know these hoes will be hoes, the story has been told
Swear I'll shoot a nigga down if he play me on my paper chase
My patience thin trying to win in this amazing race
I die for money, I done seen my momma cry for money
Waking up at 6 just to wait for the WIC

Thought About You,Stolen Youth,2013,"I just wanna get my bread
And talk my shit 'fore I end up dead
I got all this blood sitting on my hands
I never gave no fuck, so they understand
Why I feel this way, just found God and I still don't pray
'Cause Satan prey on the weak, swear I can do it myself
Soul stuck in the beats, it's like I'm crying for help;
Still, my expression is bleak, because my momma ain't
Raised no bitch, never take no shit
From no nigga 'less he wanna see the black four-fifth
From the ghetto where the oceans is, but all hope is lost
We know the laws and quick to break 'em once the dough involved
Young age, they wrote us off, guns blaze, they go to court
I got a lot of homies gone, product of they broken home
But who to say what's right and wrong? They ain't live it
Looking straight into their eyes still, and they ain't get it

But if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I ever had
I'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past
They say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh
We gave all that we had and got nothing

As far as music, kid, I'm innovative
Niggas pretend to hate it, influence you niggas' favorite
You stupid believing different, authentic, you lack the stitching;
Sitting when it's game time, snitching when you face time
What's wrong with you niggas?
See, I was brought up where that talking get you shot up at apartments
Where the bitch that set you up had told you meet her just that morning
Just a warning, my performance astounding
Everybody want something, get these niggas from round me
Tryna climb skyscrapers
Life is but a dream but it's never what it seems
So I never leave my weapon at the house
Rather spend time sitting behind bars than in the grave
I'm getting paid tryna change from my sinning ways

But if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I ever had
I'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past
They say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh
We gave all that we had and got nothing

Working on my 1,000 time telling you sorry
Walking around, pretending it ain't affect me
But nothing was further from the truth
Least I'm tryna recoup, just blame it on the youth
No matter what you feel or seen, I was in it too
Probably more than you would ever believe
You gave me something I would never receive again
We prob'ly won't be again, but would you expect it, though?
I'm just the nigga that I promised you I was
When you swore that I was better
Was in it through the weather storm
Just was better moving on
There was a time I thought that I would never think about you again
You was the best friend a nigga could have
I used to call you when I thought that I would die that day
And you would calm me down, and I would make my way
You prob'ly should have stayed; it just wasn't your place
I thought about you today",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-and-larry-fisherman-thought-about-you-lyrics

English dikes on the back and they screaming, ""Fuck life!""
To be honest, only fuck twice
My drug jacket got the thug stripes
I'm glad they hate me, they ain't love Christ or Mike Jordan either
Dip my blunts in ether, chase the last name of Aretha
When they hear me through the speakers
Man these niggas know I mean it
The mannerisms of a genius, models down to seen it
The flow is scenic, the ho is black, the car is European
Cream soda what we put the lean in
Fuck your team, your clique, whatever you banging
I come through blunt lit, bucket low, nuts hanging
Like nigga what? Nigga yawk! Niggas know me
The fucking dollar, crossed to the dark side so it's fuck Obi Kenobi
You active, motherfucker then show me
I tell your fucking wife to blow me
Nigga, it's still fuck you (Still fuck you)

Yo, still searching for Easter pink on Easter Sunday
Black lip pastor Herb done lit the herb and passed it your way
Master with the nouns and verbs, you haven't heard the wordplay?
I'm the most def here, shouts to black Dante
The stakes is high, who'd like to climb on my gate
Live from the last name of Kanye
I heard your whoop de whoop and blase blases
So when I cut you off consider Kendrick Lamar
You know it's all in the family tree
The helix of my DNA should read T-D-E, what can I say?
I left a acid tab for Da$h on his dashboard
I hope he don't crash trying to dash for it
Your bitch fucking like, like I paid cash for it
Motherfucker, Soul!

It's Young Fisherman sinking in Lake Michigan
Innocence, voice of an angel, so Minnie Riperton
Getting lit exquisite bitch, live from the Wimbledon
Still sinning as Bill Clinton, that's ill pimping
She butt-naked swimming, I'm paying her no attention
Workaholic, got a TV show, I know you seen the crib
Nasty since a younging it's unsanitary birth
Watch this beat get buried in a hearse, yeah I kill myself
Mac hippy analog, rap midi turn the cameras off
I made you snap, I'll slap your bandana off
Your bitch greet me like I'm Santa Claus
Mouth wide, I'm high as a satellite see
I'm in ancient Greece getting head from Aphrodite
Mac is mighty, got a bunch of whities actin' like me
I set the bar high, this a bizarre ride, word to Pharcyde
In plaid pants, hit a hole in one on the par 5
Eyes closed drinking whiskey, let the car drive
These hoes thirsty, see the dick and they large-eyed

Never gave a dollar to the pastor
Hoes can't get inside my home without the password
My past worth was measured by those who got less then now
Safe to say you motherfuckers know you like my style
Paved the way for they new found vision
Now they mad at a nigga, call me dad when you preaching boy
Never one for tripping, find me full-speed sprinting
While they yelling coldchain
Please tell me what it is and what it ain't
Niggas sniffling, catching feelings while I'm laughing to the bank
Chasing bitches that they'll probably never get, what a shame
Meanwhile I'll be sitting in this critical acclaim
Walking drowsy off a plane, drinking water in the rain
With your daughter trying to garnish her brain for future reference

Way back, back when people used to learn from rap
I'm here to show you motherfuckers what I learn from Pac Slimm

One 16 wipe you niggas off the map quick

Going for the kill cause I never really had shit

Two straps been moved that across the interstate

We be shooting up the parties like we got no sense
Ride around the city trippin, we ain't got no tints
Hood been my home, I ain't got no rent
We be chillin' on the pop like we livin' on the pop
Never slipping, I ain't trying to see the prison like my pops
Never giving you a pass if I consider you a Op
Don't consider you a threat if you ain't sending niggas shots
Got some killas with me down to put a nigga in the dirt
Light the candles on the curb, send a message to the cops
Snitch niggas in the feds sending letters to the cops
So I never trust a soul, when they ask I'm never speaking
My Beretta Scott King strong and black as she could be
Team trying to gangrene like that old Max B
Old French Montana, macaroni with the cheese
Young Joe Montana throwing bullets through your defense
They need Vince, you should put him on your team
If I die in these streets then consider me a martyr
Enemy goes five-deep in the charger
Down to shoot though cause I got that jumper
Been on that block this my 19th summer
Momma playing Stevie Wonder in the kitchen while she cooking
Pigs knocking at the door to take my dad to central booking
Reading books up in my room cause she won't let me go and play
Scared her youngest son will run around and go pick up a K


Fuck that shit you represent I'm here to get these presidents
Wouldn't be the only king to come up where the peasants live
Pray to God I never do the shit that both my parents did
History repeats itself, it's up to me to change it
Watch me burn the book of life and write the pages in my favor
On some King James shit
Call me Mr. on some Rosewood Ving Rhames shit
Keep a pistol in the Gap fleece
We aim quick, leave a nigga on the backstreets
Same old shit, you heard Stuck In My Ways
No the show don't stop, I could do it for days
If you disrespect my family we all gon' fight
Swinging like T Woods, trying to earn my stripes
Yeah that uppercut will fuck him up so say goodnight",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-and-larry-fisherman-outro-lyrics
Back Sellin Crack,Stolen Youth,2013,"I done beat the brakes off niggas, shot the face off niggas
Pending case with the state, and I'm still out trippin'
All the feds take pictures, fuckin' up my image
Even mama bringin' drama, I don't trust no bitches
See these hoes be out here switching their sides
When its time for the killin' i ride
Look right in my eyes, been ready to die
Risk felony time for threatening mine, better than I, nobody alive
Nobody live the life that I did, fighting to live since I was kid
Playing in the yard with a 30-06
House look like a gun range, room look like a gun store
Either you're gonna know my name, or niggas dying young and poor
Either way don't give a fuck, you gon' find me northbound
With the shit, I'm in the shit, you know I love them gun sounds
7's cry, macs applaud, 
they taking shots, I had to call
You catch 'em out the shot gun, that's Roddy White from 50 yards
No body shots, I'm hitting jaws
Tryna run you Stephen Hawking
You see I mean this shit I'm talking, you don't want no problem

Slave to the rhythm, shoot my master in his back
Two dope boys, in the Cadillac strapped
Wood grain dash, windshield stained glass
Beatin' down the ave, like we back sellin' crack
Killin' for the karma, but livin' for my mama
Trouble what the call us, and nothing what they offer
Off 'em, and they wonder why niggas get shot
And they wonder why niggas shot

Where you at, where you from? Cause it's hot where I'm at
Any time of the day you get robbed or get jumped
Its a game that we play, to get paid
For the wants and the needs of the young
Snakes slide through the grass
Blades slide in the back of the used and abused
Tryna walk in my shoes
Get tripped by my fuse, too short
Ask God what you want, he said I want your life
Well I ain't live mines right
But if I do the crime then I do the time
I ain't scared of shit, I was born to die
Extended clip, big .45, been quick to trip
And been lost my mind, when I die, please don't let mama cry
Cause she know it had to be him or I, and I got caught slippin'
Get a gun and go knock that nigga
Run up on him, no mask, no feelings, no room for that
They shoot at us, then we shootin' back
Burnin' shells till I burn in hell
And I'm cool with that, that uzi packed
I done learned a lot in these 19 years
Lotta homies ain't shed one tear
God decide what my curfew is
So till the day, I'mma do my shit
I proved my shit, they know my name
Not proud of the outcome, either have regrets or
Be out young, don't sleep

Slave to the rhythm, shoot my master in his back
Two dope boys, in the Cadillac strapped
Wood grain dash, windshield stained glass
Beatin' down the ave, like we back sellin' crack
Killin' for the karma, but livin' for my mama
Trouble what the call us, and nothing what they offer
Off 'em, and they wonder why niggas get shot
And they wonder why niggas shot

I took tHe blue pill and its evidence was sHown
Homies from elementary some tHem niggas gone
I got tHis cocaine but my stove ain't turning on
I got tHat knock-knock, uh, yeaH you know

Heaven,Stolen Youth,2013,"Fuck these bitches, I'm focused on business
Got 'em running in the hood like I bought a new engine
What these niggas try to save I'll spend in a minute
All this money in the way, niggas ain't in my vision
I was really on that block, I came up from nothin'
Putting everything in it, it was all or nothin'
Now these diamonds on my neck got all these bitches fuckin'
With a kid, they used to sin, now I'm the one who fronted
See this Rollie on my wrist, that thing glitter and gold
Eatin' off this old bread, all these niggas go mold
Middle fingers to the haters and niggas that told
Money over everything, that's the way that I roll

I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like
I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like

I got bitches, all I see is bitches, all I see is bitches
Windows tinted Hide some people in it
We extremely lifted Ain't no limits
Kids defying physics Crucifying bitches
Ain't your business how I spend my time, I got bigger fish to fry
They telling lies, I swear to God
Heaven left 'em mesmerized
Everything ain't televised
When it rain, then it shines
Nevermind. Missing all the devil's signs
Hellen Keller blind, you need eyes
Then I'mma come and lend you mine
Every time I start walking proud, they wanna chop chop chop chop me down
I just wanna make out with Foxy Brown
Monday nights, shit raw for now
Close it up, yeah I lock it down
Smoking blunts 'til I'm Gangnam Style
Coughin' into my coffin now
Have a bad bitch, money, and a crocodile
With me
Rest in peace to Pimp C
Set me free Need ecstasy
I just really wanna get my jet to leave
Go and play the front 9 at Pebble Beach
Just set some goals that I'll never reach
Get you high, seven leaves, never peak
Good energy 'til it's rest in peace

I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like
I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like

Running out of hope, running wild cuz my momma close
To dying while we broke, a youngest child, I always listened to my father
When he spoke, because he'd been through it all
A Chris Paul jersey hung on the wall in ninth grade
Back when niggas only wanted to ball
We used to steal from the mall and had to run from the guards
But now we run from the law with guns stuffed in our drawers
And all my chambers revolve cuz I can't risk gettin' caught
I got too much on my plate, I think a better tomorrow is what I'm trying to make
At least for most where I stay, I learned at a young age ain't no savin' 'em all
See some problems is born too far gone to be solved
I got a lot on my heart. Scorn the weary
Never believin' no woman, cuz bitches lie on the frequent
Live and die by this gun, niggas ain't shooting for fun
So run your pockets, we need it

I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like
I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second

Guns & Roses,Stolen Youth,2013,"Guns and Roses, another young boy lost, another fallen soldier
Younger brother tears' falling on his mother's shoulders
She got some tears of her own, wish she had loved him stronger
13, but he grown, you see the gun he holding, that was made for a man
The rush he get when he load it is one you won't understand unless you hold it and blow it
Granny moved from New Orleans searching for better life
A troubled cardiac is all she got, eating that McDonalds by the laundromat
Daughter was 17, she just want to know where the party at
Met somebody that night, fucked him, he never called her back
Now her oldest bastard son sitting in that casket
Young victim of the guns and roses
Living young and hopeless

Guns and roses, another young girl lost
You see her heart was broken, she used to love so strong
'Til she got done wrong, ain't wanna feel no guilt
She blamed it all on home, but still it felt so real
And, shit, she lie so well
Her parents never could tell where she was really at
Now is it really love or just another lie
To fuck inside his mama's truck raw like the emotions
Of her crying that night, her pillow soaked
She miss the hope she had as a kid
But he doing all the things that her dad never did
He'll be the dad of a kid if she have it, but still he'd rather not
Steal her mother's car, hit the bar
Just to grab a shot from the guns and roses
Living young and hopeless

Guns and roses, I had it all in my home but Mother never noticed
The neighborhood where I roamed was known for countless encounters
Of people pressin' they line, I try to stay in my boundary
When bounties placed on your head for shit you never had did
You just conform to survive, not tryin' to sit in no pit
I like me better alive, three 57s for six, eleven fit in the nine
I take 'em both when I dip cuz I ain't dyin' today
It's just a game that we play, what you bang? where you stay?
Before you answer just spray, they'll never see it coming
Hit a man woman, child, or dog because it's mine before yours
It's two weapons in wars and that's
The guns and roses, young victim of the guns and roses",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-and-larry-fisherman-guns-and-roses-lyrics
Intro,Stolen Youth,2013,"Live from Delusion
Die on the street or reside in the ruins
Run and hide from police, throw the 9 in the sewer
25 is the least of the time that you doin'
Do or die, staying true to the lies on the stand
Right hand on the word of a God and forget
All the wrongs that you did tryna live by your means
Breaking news, 10 PM, see your friends on the screen
And these bitches wanna talk about some ma'fuckin' rap
Bullet holes in the home where my lil' brother at
Pigs parked on the street, so we can't shoot back
Spent a week where I sleep, most can't do that
Might look half neat 'til the nightfall come
First the Goodyear screech then you hear that drum
Fuck 911, police don't come
Had Jabari on the streets 'til the sun came up
Momma's son raised up in the midst of a feud
I'm from genocide where you die for your residence
Die for the presidents I chase who reached the same fate
So I never get to thrive in the relishment
Might seem jaded but even Satan was heaven-sent
Could've been a bum, broke sleeping by the 710
17 dropped out, knew I had to make a way
Couldn't have my granny broke 'fore she see the pearly gates
Hope she ain't judged for me
Only person livin' ever showed love to me
Dad did time 'cause he sold drugs for me
I could never judge a man tryna better off his fam
Shoot a fucker where he stand, gotta take you to your maker
'Til I'm buried in the grass and the candle light the pavement
I'ma do it to the best of my abilities, the fear in me is gone
You can hear it in the song while you listenin'

Stuck in My Ways,Stolen Youth,2013,"I wanna ask God why the Bible lied to me
Just full of politics, leaving niggas without a sin
Now is it false prophets who forged the religious documents?
I done spent my whole life sinning without a consequence
Momma trying to figure what the fuck my problem is
And why I gotta live this way, I know my path ain't straight
But in the field, don't nothing but grit matter
Just get it how you live and figure the shit after
Nigga, gotta get it before I die out here
Don't wanna see my mama cry out tears, sitting below the earth
Cause Heaven's out of the question, but for what it's worth
We made the most out of the nothing they give us
Heart was frigid but both these boulders sit on my shoulder
I try to figure my motive for leaving niggas behind
But if my fate is defied, hope whatever messiah that sent me there
Knew he only did this shit for survival

I'm so stuck in my ways
The love and the hate was both shoved in my face
Gotta stay on your toes, head starts in the race
Just wasn't given to those who came up where I stay
Ya name up in the game, but start watching ya back
These hoes want what you got, trying to plot on your stacks
Still the plot thickens
Yeah, they better hope God with 'em

Is black pride still alive, or was niggas trippin?
Cause last time I checked, we lost self respect
And some didn't admit it cause mama was with the business
And daddy was trying to fuck, he left, that's just his luck
Suppressed, nothing but anger inside that chamber
Aim from the other side so we hate him, no need explaining
Baby momma drama cause karma being a hater
Now it's lookin' like abortion, your momma doing the favor
Black Buick Le Sabre, creeping down the street
No tags on the whip so you sneakin' past police
25, two strikes, you don't need a number three
They pull you over, now you nervous 'cos the heater by the seat

I'm so stuck in my ways
The love and the hate was both shoved in my face
Gotta stay on your toes, head starts in the race
Just wasn't given to those who came up where I stay
Ya name up in the game, but start watching ya back
These hoes want what you got, trying to plot on your stacks
Still the plot thickens
Yeah, they better hope God with 'em",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-and-larry-fisherman-stuck-in-my-ways-lyrics
Killin Yall,Stolen Youth,2013,"Black-lip bastard, destined to be a bastard Crip
But I passed on it to make classic hits
I pray I'm forgiven for not being down or
Putting the work in that certain niggas did, reason behind they service
In the pen partially why I don't write
I just pull it out the wind, sometime I can't sleep at night
I be thinking 'bout my friends, know they up to no good, it's all bad
I seen the yellow tape at Del's and almost had a heart attack
You never know with this shit, I don't understand
Kids carry cannons on Instagram, but crying when the cuffs on they hands
It's out my hands, it's two sides to every story
And I ain't a judge or signed up for jury duty
My youth was stolen moving too quick, it's sick, though
Cause Vince know what I know now when I'm 26
We still moving further, 
hope seeds grow to be
Trees
 and not just bushes hiding burners

Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without-

Call the gang unit, they know the name, foolie
I truly was built for this shit
I'm in the ring cooling right by where the enemies live
You know you can't kill a giant with a lucky shot
Aim for the head when you fuck with God Jehovah
Hopefully be speaking the colder the beat, 
snitching
We doming your niece
, homies as cold as police
Momma had told us as kids never to shit where you eat
Ain't got a clip for the heat, .357, I think I'm Itch Dawg
Niggas know I'm 6-5 'til I'm six feet
Under where they took us, undercovers parked on Orizaba
Dogs up in the yard of the abandoned where we hide the choppers
I couldn't hide from the karma, you see, it followed me
Fuck it! Get it cracking in public, these niggas rap for the fashion
They want the mansion, they puppets
A puppet master will bust and that chamber talk but I'm muzzled

Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?",https://genius.com/Vince-staples-and-larry-fisherman-killin-yall-lyrics
Fantoms,Stolen Youth,2013,"Understand me, nigga, dont need no Grammys, give us
The money you got in your pockets, I feel like taxing, nigga (Give it up, nigga)
'Bout the action, give me a reason, Ill gladly get it knockin
Chunky 9 right by my side look like a midget walkin
Watch the shit that you talkin, promise it's with me often
I gotta stop with the trigger talkin, I promised momma
But Im rapping my life (I live this shit,) load automatics at night
Ops dont come to the Pop, they know they gettin dropped
Gettin' on, cause I be getting off in my lane
You gettin no luck, get a job (Get a job, nigga)
I should throw my shows at synagogues, mention me
When you mention God, but fuck it, Im just talkin shit to yall

Young and gunnin, niggas stay drummin
Big tools in your house, said we here for the plumbin'
Yeah, the niggas say they wit' it, but the boys frontin'
Chopper shots wet your block, fuck niggas say somethin
Fuck, fuck niggas say somethin
( say somethin) Fuck niggas say somethin
(Young and gunnin') Niggas stay drummin
Chopper shots wet your block, fuck niggas say somethin

Chop a chopper down, they told me never run
Unless you hear them copper sounds, I got them copper rounds
Gunnin' for them gold plaques
A 2014 Benz with the low jack, Pirellis's and the pistol stack
Ridin' down Obispo Ave, thinkin' 'bout the bus days
Never goin' back to that, checks be coming back-to-back
Put you on the front page, have the homies handle that
Pro Club hoodie, strapped, socks with the sandals wrapped (Uh)
Long Beach legend, Jordan kicked me out
If you from the city, that should tell you what I'm really 'bout (Northside, nigga)
Skippin' class to get the cash, run ya mouth, I'll kick your ass
But I'm just talkin' shit again (Uh)

Young and gunnin, niggas stay drummin
Big tools in your house, said we here for the plumbin'
