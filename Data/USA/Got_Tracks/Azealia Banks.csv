Liquorice,1991 - EP,2011,"Look, niggas really wanna beat they chest for B-A-N-K-S
These niggas be gorillas for the pin-k flesh

They just want the pumpernickel sis in the linens with 'em
So since you vanilla men spend
Can my hot fudge bitches get with your vanilla friends?
Hey, I’m the liquorice bitch
You know I’m looking for these niggas if these niggas is rich

Hey, I’m the Liquorice bitch

Hi, I wanna get the number to your 212 line
Maybe we could slumber, we could woo-woo-woo-wine

Bet you really wanna touch up on the molasses ass
Bet you really wanna tongue up on her kizzat today
Cause her kizzat sh-shaved
You wanna cuddle with ya bitch after, eh
But I gotta dip I gotta get at the cake
Lotta scrillac to make, and the dick don’t fuck up any scrillac for Banks
No issues picking money over ha-ha, ya beige in her
She just wanna see the best in Greece with some gentlemen and check these beats in the sun
He just wanna see the wet-wet weave when I’m swimming in the West Indies
Then I sit up and catch these breeze
Sip a little bit of Rum & Ting, nigga

These bitches know that I be on that black girl shit
That black girl pin-up with that black girl dip
Put that black girl spin up on ya whack girl tip
Ain’t official till it been up in that black girl kit
Pick out ya mans and attack real quick, I’ma hit him with that venom and that rap girl hip
I slip out the denims, know that black girl fit, get that Remy in a did and hit that black girl switch
Bitches better tan for the summer,
 and for the haters
Quit that chit chat and get ya paper
Quote the cinnamon
The cherry-melange bitch verbatim
When I speak about your face in the clam with the flavors
You get that?
And stimulate her
Take a lick up on my genital, then sit to savor
Do ya man’s and his licorice interest a favor

Can I catch your eye, sir
Can I be what you like, yeah
I could be the right girl
Tell me if you like your lady in my-my color

Sipping champys on the isles
Nineteen number naughty baby
Press it on your dial
Sex kitten honeys
No cougars in the house
I'mma hush the rumors and the doubt
Came in the game with a beat and a bounce
Never for the fame, my feet on the ground
Cloud number nine, headed to the stars
Maybe I ride with my mic in my bra
Maybe I recite in the raw the appetite for life and the hunger for the more
The island of Manhattan
I was Born in New York, city never slumbers
I would always dream but never sleep to the hundreds
Cocoa want the cream in abundance
Million dollar baby you can get it if you want it, what

Fierce,Fantasea,2012,"Bambi, belle of the ball
Banjee, better than them all
Never been a flaw
Pretty kitty manicure the claws, silly
Never been a draw
When I purr bet he wanna paw
Cause a stir when she on the floor
Giving it her all
Champagne always on the pour
Some happy, others can applaud
Bum bitches aggy, but of course
Mermaid coming on the shore
Take the prince crown and the coin
Shut it down then a bitch is gone
'Nother round of Dom Pérignon
Downtown vampin' to the song
Tiara on my head when it's worn
Style get the critics and amor
Physically shawty is the bomb
Whether blue weave or the blonde
Harlem or Milan
Banks break the bank and the bonds

See, I used to think I was fierce
’Cause I was in all the houses
I won trophies
I used to munch trade for dollars too
But see I’m fiercer now
’Cause I got a job, I got an education
And I got somebody waiting at home for me, goddamit
Now one queen asked me the other day was it
She told me, ""Miss Thing, you think you’re fierce?""
I said, ""Of course""
She said, ""All queens think they're fierce""
I said, ""Miss Thing, all queens ain't me!""

Bon appétit, I'm a feast for the eyes
The reason why I’m, in luxury designs
So chic, so ahead of time
Kunt queen, princess of the prize
Witness the baddest bitch alive
Reporting from the belly of the night
Gorgeous, plus the world is mine
A girl with a twirl and a rhyme
Diamonds and a pearl on the shine
Welcome to her house in the sky

The house, the house
Work me, the house
'Cause you pay ten dollars get in the ball, you-
Work me, the house
Work me, the house
Work me, the house
'Cause you pay ten dollars get in the ball, you-
The house, the house
Work me, the house
'Cause you pay ten dollars get in the ball, you-
Work me, the house
Work me, the house
Work me, the house
'Cause you pay ten dollars get in the ball, you mop-
The house, the house, the-the house
The house, the house, the-the house
Work me, goddamit

Back at it again
My only bad habit's, my addiction to win
She only mad, I did it better than her friends
You better have cheddar to attend
Wang gown with leather on the trim
Get together with the slim
Mermaid who came on the swim
Wave to the gents
Do my dips and the spin
Turn tricks for the fucking ends?
You turned dick for the fucking gem?
You a bum bitch to the end
Come again, come again?
You running with the wrong sip, rum to the gin?
Bambi work it out like felons in the gym
Hey fella, f-fella I'm better than a ten
Eleven in the denim, 'bout twelve in her skin
Young mademoiselle, the devil wears Prada

He like black girls and he love a musician
I'm fucking with this older nigga, he a fucking magician, son
He tricking off, cause my verse perverse
And jerking off when a bitch rehearse him
And when I lift the skirt, your nigga never gotta be coerced
To just squirt and he eats the dessert and that’s some real shit
I mean real tits, nice ass, tight twat
Dome fucking up a nigga home, call a bitch S.W.A.T
Uh, I get it tighter than a gridlock
Open your face and let a bitch squat
I tell him you should let his bitch watch
Cause she wanna kiss, nah
I tell her she could lick this box
Cause I ain’t really with that dick-swap
Even if you switch socks
Bitch is fishier than Chip Shop
And he was praying that her shit pop
Every time I say deeper, I get it warmer than a space heater
No ordinary taste either, it's that candy
He was tryna lick it off the seam of my panties
I was tryna kick him out, but he was like can he-
Eat a little dinner, want to sit with my family
Nah, there's probably not a lot in this container
If it ain’t about a dollar, I’m a holler at you later (ha!)

Ayo, shout out all my ratchet bitches
Aha, shout out all the ratchet bitches, ratchet bitches make the world go 'round
Word up, if it wasn't for ratchet bitches, I don't know where I would be in life
*Laughing*
Yo, ratchet bitches holdin' it down
Ratchet bitches hold a nigga down more than the prissy bitches and the boujie bitches do 'cause ratchet bitches used to that bull shit
They used to gettin' life's short end of the stick so, they know how to deal with opposition

Esta Noche,Fantasea,2012,"Tonight's the night, the mood is right
Anything I choose he buys
I observe by his shoes and ties
He prefer the exclusive kind
Converse over blues and wine
Tonight's the night, the jewels is bright
Any way I move he likes
He is searching for cutie pie
He could scoop and sign
Keep that blue dress down to my Louboutins
Keep my calm, keep my cool
Heard you got a girlfriend but she's a deuce
Wanna see the little Bambi in the nude
Chocolate candy, liquorice too
Wanna book a ticket, get physical soon
Head of the class, but I got principles too
Arching my back give him a view
He wanna taste the cinnamon too
Sex is a race, I'm winning it too
I'm a rude bitch but I like gentlemen

Ima be legendary when I end this
They rise when I arrive in this

Tell the carriage, hurry up and come and get me
Tell the haters run along you can miss me

Gimme a Chance,Broke with Expensive Taste,2014,"That's the way that our love can grow
(Can grow, can grow, can grow, can grow)

Carolina H fits, hottest bitch from the block
Used to puff Phillies n' Duchies n' Stuff Nicks
Now I light doobies, the cutie from five fifth!
Life like a movie, she typing her own script
What this? young sis
Made it from the cement, started pushing her own bricks
Put on for her city, I pop in Metropolis
Hold this, chocolate and focused
Know this, vocal and chosen
Opponents, leave ‘em dead in they own crypt!
Murder she wrote, she prefer it in cursive
The purse sick, the verse is perversive
They worship, making the words skip
Superb witch in demand, she’s perfect
Understand the plan the blueprint
100 grand in the hand its on grip

That's the way that our love can grow
Make the play and then not too slow
Gimme A Chance, I will have to make you dance
Make a play upon the dance floor
I'll be waiting there 'till knock the door

Money getting galore, cream cover the pores
Honey drip on ya jaw, Mami spittin' allure
I'mma get it for sure, getting it all
I'm dreaming it big, 2Pac it Shakur!
Vision it clear, who’s stopping a star?
You deep in the rear while I'm knocking it forward
Impressing the pair/peer, but 3 get ‘em a charm
You checking from where? New Yorker to heart
Harlem girl from the block, ponytail with the part
If you give me a gimme a, I'mma give you a lot
Many Benji’s from Penny's bet you can’t hustle a fox!
Tony, Oscar, or Emmy is you acting or not?
Phony homies and any and who happen to plot?
They come up with empty, while you beam to the top
While you cream of the crop!

That's the way that our love can grow
Make the play and then not too slow
Gimme A Chance, I will have to make you dance
Make a play upon the dance floor
I'll be waiting there 'till knock the door

Llevate el dinero, y ese bandolero
Nada me hace falta, y yo a el no lo quiero
Todo mi vida cambiado, estoy mejor cada dia
Lamento informarte, no funcionó la brujería!
Mira como baila, la nena morena
Mira como baila, sin llanto, ni Pena
Mira como baila, la nena morena
Mira como baila, sin llanto, ni Pena

Libre independiente, me dice la gente
Rebelde y Caprichosa, pero eso es otra cosa
Yo mucho pa ti, tu muy poco pa mi
Ahora mas que nunca, me siento feliz
Actitud positiva, la regla de mi vida
Si no me conviene, hacia mi no viene
En control me quede estoy a cargo de todo
Mi vida, mi suerte como dicen ache!

Mira como baila, la nena morena
Mira como baila, sin llanto, ni Pena

Have a pour at the bar, at the promenade- yo shorty lookin' gorge
The allure of a star
They applaud and in awe...
The chips in her palm, what’s a pigeon to a swan?
A queen to a pawn?

Red carpet to the car, in a garment from the gods

Assassinate the look - murdering the gown

So prepare my niggas, gourmet grape taste, we rare my niggas

You scared, you see-through, you clear my nigga
You boys Scooby and Doo, I’m really groovy and frost
You niggas cooped in a hoop, i’m Cooley High in the Porsche
I put these niggas on mute, to whom it may not concern...
I got the bitch with the juice, you got the bitch with the germ

I got a flock of the hoots, a-list of the birds
White model the muse, Arizona the first
I took a trip from the Moon, to JFK for that work

Stitch me back together make me into who I wanna be
But all you ever do is sit in the dark
Dealing with the Devil, you ain’t never ever gonna be mine

Cause I’m born to dance in the moonlight
I feel like spending my nights alone
I try to give you a little more space to grow
White lies, I don’t wanna be around anymore
I’m through giving, I’ve got to go....

Am I chasing time? (time)
Cause I wasted all mine on you (you)

But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)
If tomorrow drops, I had my time right in my locket
But I lost it when I gave it to you (you)

Took a chance on you, double and dipped again

Hit your mans up and tell ‘em to get the van
And reminiscing can't
Bring it back to the cabin in Michigan

Say goodbye to your lover cause this the end

Please, you don’t even know me
You think I’m starting new relations
I’m just departing and need my space and
Time to myself, ventilation
No time for you, I lack the patience
And you’re like, “Girl, how you do that?""
My attitude is bitchy but you already knew that...
And since we can’t get along
I think we should both move on

Chega de Saudade,Fantasea II: The Second Wave,2016,"Vai, minha tristeza
E diz a ela que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer

Chega de saudade
A realidade é que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza, é só tristeza, melancolia
Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços
Os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de você viver sem mim
Não quero mais esse negócio de você viver sem mim",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-chega-de-saudade-lyrics

Don't release me, don't let me go
Till the sun rises in the morning

Can I watch while you row your boat?
I love the way you stroke it
I know you know, boy I say, I know you know
I'll be missing you until the next time we're along the coast
Yeeeaaah

It's alright for you to touch my ooooh
Hold me tight, you know you feel so good
Spend the nights under the stars and moon
Make it last until the afternoon

Dewy dawn, a misty morning breeze
Set ablaze an entire forest of trees
That's fine by me...

How low can you go? How deep does your love go, baby?
Let me, let me know, make love on the ocean floor

Gold rings, got gold buttons
Going up and down my sheep skin
We the wolf pack and it's a cold summer
Never deep, I keep one gunna
Say her name I might run up on ya
Send that text ""I wanna touch ya girl""
If they don't fuck with us, well, it's fuck the world
Ice box for my princess
Got a double M on that pendant
And back in, I'm bout to spend that
Got a big bag and I been rich
We make love and she talk slick
G-Wagon, she a boss bitch
Major League in that boy pitch
Major League in that boy pitch
Mussolini when I'm out in Rome
Cleopatra, she dipped in gold
Pussy shot and she centerfold
Bel-Air and my mind blown
Rosé and I'm checking out like Caesar did
Slide down my sword
She a blasphemy cause she love The God
Pray you never let 'em come crucify the boy

Black magic, David Blaine flow
Colour money like a rainbow
Azealia Banks keep the bank rolls
Shine like illuminated Angels
Bad bitch, I'm bodacious
Black power but I'm no racist
Balling, I don't need no agent
In the Maybach feelin' so spacious
Focused on another hundred thou
Going up another level now
Nigga's wildin', better settle down
Got the Rollie diamonds in the bezel now
Take notes, get your pen and pencil
With Ricky Ross, we quintessential
Ain't nothing here incidental
We poppin' off on instrumentals
Slide off in the Rolls Royce
I'm slaying bitches in a grey mink
You can slide on it like escapades
This ice on me like a skating rink
Big talk, big bank
Pussy wetter than the Great Lakes
And for this life, I'mma give thanks
And pray they never gon' burn a witch at the stake

I'd swim across the sea
A day or two to lay with you
Now we're in love again
Let's do it again, and again (and again x5)

Pressure building steam, now I feel so high
Pleasure place, I've never been here before

Build me, love me, lift me high
Relax my soul and ease my mind
More than lust, more than sex and love

If your heart calls me from afar
I'd swim across the sea
A day or two to lay with you
Now we're in love again
Let's do it again, and again (and again yeah)

Pressure building steam, now I feel so high (high, high)
Pleasure place, I've never been here before

Build me, love me, lift me high
Relax my soul and ease my mind
More than lust, more than sex and love
Feel the roaring ripping tide
Slow as the azure day arrives
More than lust, more than sex and love",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-escapades-lyrics
Icy Colors Change,Icy Colors Change - EP,2017,"I see colors changing away
Every holiday is amazing with you
Happy holidays to you, baby

How do you feel about the pale moon and stars above?
All alone I anticipate the first fresh blade of green
The young hydrangea blue, in bloom
Pink rhododendron too will all be gone by June
But now that we have grown so near beneath the August sun
Lover of mine, let's catch some shade beneath the fading trees
Of all the seasons jewels, it took
One autumn afternoon to fall in love with you

The Benz is butter beige
I whip that Benz like ""what a slay""
Got that good good
Make you wanna stay, home for the holiday
This that flow you been missing
Dashing young Vixen
Fly like Blitzen, back on my business
Ice on my neck, frosty and vicious
What's on your wishlist?
Got what you want, my love is like Christmas
Candles, kisses, diamonds, frigid, fashion district
Sip this witches brew, first class ticket to you
Fantasies come true when I kick it with you
In the winter wonderland when you hold my hand
Came back on the block where the guns go blam
We pick out the tree like Amsterdam
, damn

When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet
I need your love
I see you through my rosy colored shades
Sit on Santa's sleigh for me
Bet I'll keep you 'cause you're my cozy candy cane
We  all the same
I need your love
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet
If I be yours and you're mine
Every other day will be a holiday for me and you
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet

See lights in the night, you could feel it in the air
Party over here, we getting naughty over here
Santa Claus know I floss and shine, Rudolph
Talk - New York, style - catwalk
See me in the streets like ""how much that cost?""
Can't keep up with the queen, baby, that's your loss
You know I get dough
Kiss from the lips under mistletoe
Now you in my spell, ringing up my cell, hitting jingle bells
It's the hot coco, not for show
Lock n' load, rock n' roll, I gots to go
Pack your shit, start the whip
Ride with me, fly with me
Keep it real but you could lie with me
And you ain't gotta say goodbye to me

When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet
I need your love
I see you through my rosy colored shades
Sit on Santa's sleigh for me
Bet I'll keep you cause you're my cozy candy cane
We  all the same
I need your love
When the leaves fall, I learn why
Icy colors change
To me you are the same old sweet

A doe, a doe, a deer anew, a fawn
A doe, the day, the dew, the dawn
What sort of déjà vu's upon us?
Wood blocks of A-B-C strewn through the hall
And gold champagne for two adorers
A song to celebrate our love
Red garland drapes the tree like you
When your arms are 'round my waist, I feel the world
Our love will grow and take us farther
Now I've a reverie of you and you're a
You're a ray, a view of sun
A star ablaze the moonlit water",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-icy-colors-change-lyrics
Crown,Slay-Z,2017,"Chance you've seen her once in a dream
Let me show you better, bring you closer to see
Can you undress her down to her lingeries
Run your fingers through the middle while I smoke potpourri
Got champagne spilling on the sofa, the seats
Looking cocaine dealer white - a code for the key
Hit em' with the venom
With the cobra, the squeeze
And I really wanna wrestle with the boa in ya jeans
I look at you
Look at us, look at me
Got a vision of a lovin'
That we both wanna see
Shouldn't I, wouldn't I
Couldn't I be your lucky lady f-forever f-f
Come on

When I'm repping this crown
I be stepping in style

Doing feminine things
Pink lemonade chain and my belly ring bling
When I come for this cash
Not a regular bitch, don't you ever forget
That I'm repping this crown
So you better wild out when the queen is in town

Mami on a mint Kawasaki 
in the Chloé khaki
Issey Miyake
, folding yen with Miss Origami
I'm a global bitch, you a local thotty
I be, I be in a Paris lobby
Playing Tamigotchi, who Pocket Polly?
Hop to Mali, sisters in Bali
Get the picture, papi, get richer mami (Uh)
It really ain't fair
You see me, you see me, you stop and you stare
Finessing and flair
You see me I'm sexy, them bitches they jealous
I step in the room and I'm breaking your focus
I bet you your fellas be checking up on it
I jump in the Rover, I rip up the road
And I'm ready, I'm naked
I'm knocking, now open up

And once you find out what I'm talking 'bout
You'll never be lonely
You see the stars and the clouds up above you
And baby no one will ever, ever love you like I do

The Love I’ve Never Known,Unreleased Songs,2017,"The more you anger God, the harder you fall from Heaven
'Cause even Satan was a angel 'fore falling to Hell
It's the young disciple, picked the prophecy, born with the message
And either way these niggas feel it, they gonna respect it
The makers form the faithful daughter that waters the essence
I cried a river just to swim and then learn a good lesson
Burning 'em baby, burning 'em bridges
We wanna wreck it
Oh baby, you danger
I'll never change ya, I know you reckless
That pain is that proof of pleasure
I tangle with seven devils
You doing the wrong things
You sexing the jezebel
I can tell you a 'LOL' type of fellow, you funny nigga
Who gets the last laugh?
It's who gets the cash fast
You are the love i've never known
The only one that knew me
Learn your lesson boy
You're turning my life to stone",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-the-love-ive-never-known-lyrics

My mentality is like professors grading papers
Cause we know it ain't correct if I ain't looking at a check
Staten Island where the youngin' wildin' for respect
They wanna see you capped in like a pilot on a jet
Who got it, you got it
Oh, you gotta be kidding me
Slidin' through with guap
Just to buy a few products at Tiffany's
Imma do pop and rock
Every time a new victory
Wanna turn tides, tryna get rid of me
Is we washing clothes
Flows out of nowhere, you gotta pardon those
I'm part monster, part martian, part Domino's
Whoa, cause my delivery hot
Lyrics she got, they come 20 a pop
And not dollars either
How the student gonna defy the teacher
Son, this is rap 101, just like a high fever
I'm a diva, yes

I don't be depressed about things that I don't need to stress

The Chamber,UnKnown,2017,"Listen
They is Satan here to snatch ya soul
This is your funeral
They viewing you, how I'm doing you
Time to make this casket closed
Each one of y'all acts exposed
C-town mobsters
Cause y'all just like what mobsters like to eat, y'all im-pastas
This is Coco, realest raps heard around the world
It's like Hooters, cause you came here to get served by a girl
The mob boss got caught without his armor on
Jacked the king, look how easy it is to Con Da Don
Ya whole crew is trash, time for me to tutor class
One plus one equals corny, all you do is add
Add these other two, equals group without a clue of swag
That just got subtracted and y'all Asian, y'all can do the math

Man, I hate you folks with these Asian jokes, be original
If you're gonna take a quote, please make it dope
Let's take a vote, think she could be a stripper with all them rolls?
Damn Coco, looking hella bad on them poles
Awh, pitiful, but here's where it gets critical
Cause you all up on Malik ass and he ain't even into you
You dream about him, but he don't check for you on your sick day
He should call you nap, you only good for a quick lay
I'm serious, the end is now, time for bow
I said, I said, hold up wait
I said I'm serious, the end is now

Damn right it's time for bed
With the nursery rhymes you said
My momma said you fall for everything if you stand for nothing
This for my independent women who don't need a man for nothing
Cause now the rules is switching
Think we're only good for cooking and cleaning
Well now you getting cooked and you gon' do these dishes
It's clear as Viet Cong
He think because he a guy that I'd be scared to talk fly
Nah, got that Amelia Earhart
This is a waste and I ain't playing with you chumps
I'm Rosa Parks with the lead cause I'm staying in the front
Hellen Keller, Anne Frank, Cleopatra, Billie Jean
I'm Harriet Tubman, I run the underground by any means
Just some famous women before you brag about what men can do
But enough with the history cause now it's time to finish you
Listen con, you minuscule, three feet at the swimming pool
Bums scrape you like gum off the bottom of my tennis shoe
Who wrote the IV like 4 in Roman Numerals

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm so cold, I'm so grown, I'm so real life
I'm so show-off, my diamonds designed to twinkle and bleed light
As the valley fills with darkness, shadows chase and run 'round
I can make them stop for me - and no lamb, no savior's shelter
I'll be better off alone, I'll walk at my own pace
I don't need no one, I've got my own, I've got it made
In the morning I cheer for sunshine and I feel, but I don't feel enough
In the midnight hours I try, ooh

Then you show me, now I believe
Diamonds and dreams come true for girls like me
(Princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess, princess)

Move and make it hot for me, hot rod, oh yes, I'll ride it, ride it
Dance for me, get naughty, he wild out for these expensive options
You know the glow, stuntin' in front row
Shades always, these bitches can't look, no
Bob, sleek, chic, petite, I fit those
En Vogue, I do what you can't know
I'm runway, you know they a side show
I'm first page, the main stage as I pose
The one dame, the one name that y'all know
Just take notes, stay on top like halos
Make pesos, most of these bitches is my clones
You new puss, this catwalk is my throne
I'm penthouse, you're trap house and rhinestones
These diamonds on my bones be my own
Invent styles, I been crowned, this my home
Bitch, I'm grown in ball gowns - it's french sewn
You take shots, I make shots, the end zone
These bitches overall is some Lauras, they Winslow

La Isla, we slide
Leave it to me, why?

The shoreline, you're all mine
Uh, nigga, I done gave you the co-sign
The pussy so good niggas call it a gold mine
The coin shine is something I might like
The sea queen gave you an invite
Call your travel agent up and tell him to switch flights
My little sex face, wanna see what it look like?
When you feel the boat rock, boy, better grip tight
Seems like we gonna ride out to the moonlight
You know we're gonna...

Do you need some love in your lonely world?
'Cause I believe you'll like it where the moon
Twinkles on the watery horizon
How do I get you there?
So, so ashamed to be lost for the words
To let you know that I'm sincere
The pleasuries are all on treasure island
How do I get you there?

Picture me on a jet ski
The pick of the litter, bitches really the pet peeves
Dive in your denim, wanna swim in your blue jeans
Usually in the crib in the west wing, cha-ching
Lookin' for a mister with the chip and the big thing
You wanna get with it, wanna waters and lake spring
Little lady lagoon, nigga drown so deep like he fell in a pool
And he ate so good it's like a fed him in spoons
On the coastline nude, got him humming my tunes
In pursuit for a puddle of loot
The mermaid, got the water for you
And the wave so wet that he wanted it too
Heard he claim soo-woo but he fell for the blue
You know how I do
You know how I do

Do you need some love in your lonely world?
'Cause I believe you'll like it where the moon
Twinkles on the watery horizon
How do I get you there?
So, so ashamed to be lost for the words
To let you know that I'm sincere
The pleasuries are all on treasure island

Ocean hole to float ya boat
That's why all them niggas be on coast patrol
Soak and soap, the super soak
Boy, you know you're sinking like a dose of dope
Junk in trunk, badonka-donk
I'mma back it up like a Tonka truck
Pounce and bounce to bounce on dick
Bounce on dick
Bounce on dick

Do you need some love in your lonely world?
'Cause I believe you'll like it where the moon

Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy and cozy are we
We snuggle up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
C'mon it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-sleigh-ride-lyrics
Pyrex Princess,Business and Pleasure,2019,"Tick tock, ready we on clock
Private pilots to Vegas to get some quick guap
Drip drop, icy young fox
Hottie 9 to 5, and switch my wrist watch
Pop up out the droppa toppa
Shake my tits like two maracas
Booty clappin', pussy satin
Like I'm fuckin' Silkk the Shocker
Papi pour that juice and vodka
Si mi casa es tu casa
Always been about a dolla
Diamonds dancin' all on my collar
One hundred grand, nigga, she did it again
Ridin' around in the Benz
Fuck up a band
Double it, triple it, and
Cookin' the rock in a pan
I got the plan
You just a regular jan
You just a follower, fan
Fuck with your man
I'll never hit it again
These niggas know who I am

Now I just made another
Hunnid...thousand
Now I'm dripping water, drowning
Hydro, whipping, counting, crowning
Pyro vision, pyrex princess
Now I just made another hunnid thousand
Now I'm dripping water, drowning
Hydro, whipping, counting, crowning
Pyrex vision, pyrex princess

She in demand
Bitches I come and command
Like ""bitch, like, what is your brand?""
Soon as I land gimme the butter and yams
I'm getting loot in my hand, Peruvian tan
I got the pool to the grams
Came for the sand and the clams
Running the scam
Bitches I'm always the man
Mermaid I'm always the end
Homie ain't fam, these niggas ain't ever my clan
These bitches ain't ever my end
Plotting and plan
Lately I'm harking on M's
Profit on profit on stand
Swimmin' Sedans
Baby I drown in the Benz
Bigger the body, the bigger the band
All of my diamonds is princess cut
That's why my wrists be glittered up
You spent the grip on the popular steez
Pyrex Alicia, I'm chopping them keys
Papi on E, mami on X
Finessing them white niggas out of they skis
I tell 'em gimme the, gimme the check
Gimme the check, niggas I came to collect
I got vanilla baguettes, flood the Patek
Niggas I came to finesse
I got the stick in the clip
You could get hit, you could get hit with that hex
I tell 'em to gimme the sex, gimme the sex
Then Uber 'em back to the 'jects
Mami be whipping that wet
Niggas be pressed, that's why I'm blocking they texts
Sexy lil Cola connect...watch how I hustle and flex

Now I just made another
Hunnid...thousand
Now I'm dripping water, drowning

To watch you fly beneath the rainbow

Watching the time go by me

Rolling water, floral isles

Feel the sweet escape
I know I'm gonna take you to a blissful cloud now

Make it flip like a somersault

Keep my name in their mouth like a grill
You cannot copy me
Cannot stop me
I'm sexy and real

I'm gone and I'm ghost
Cheers to my hater
See you later
I'm making the toast
They can't recall
Said they’ve seen me
They haven’t, withdraws
I just withdraw all deposits, my check and I ball
That crystal ball, show you frontin' and nothing at all
I’m with my dogs and we're ready
So don't get involved
Coast to coast
I'm the reason for these hoes and their feelings
Hands high
Put your palms all the way to the ceiling
I set the price on anybody
I know what I’m worth

You know that pussy gon wet 'em up just like a jet ski
I'm looking to my right and my left, these bitches pressed
Cuz' I machete-chop the cheddar if he let me
Aquí pura Coca, no vendemos Pepsi
Siempre él regresa porque soy bien sexy

Dice que quieres meterme el dedo grande por el culo
Y despues me chupa lo dedos de los pies- fuegan puros
He keep eating pussy but I really wanna fuck
You’ll better off just giving me some dick

Slow Hands,UnKnown,2020,"Yeah, but nobody searches
Nobody cares somehow
When the loving that you've wasted
Comes raining from a hapless cloud
And I might stop and look upon your face
Disappear in the sweet, sweet gaze
See the living that surrounds me
Dissipate in a violet place

Can't you see what you've done to my heart
And soul?
This is a wasteland now

We spies
We slow hands
Put the weights around yourself
We spies
Oh yeah, we slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
Now

I submit, my incentive is romance
I watched the pole dance of the stars
We rejoice because the hurting is so painless
From the distance of passing cars
But I am married to your charms and grace
I just go crazy like the good old days
You make me want to pick up a guitar
And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you

Can you see what you've done to my heart
And soul?
This is a wasteland now

We spies
Yeah, we slow hands
Put the weights around yourself
We spies
Oh, yeah, we slow hands
Killer for hire, you know not yourself

We spies
We slow hands
You put the weights all around yourself
We spies
Oh, yeah, we slow hands
We retire like nobody else
We spies
Intimate slow hands
Killer for hire, you know not yourself
We spies
Intimate slow hands
You let the face slap around herself",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-slow-hands-lyrics

My urge for the dough is involuntary
I need that cream like Ben and Jerry
I'm so caked up in the commissary
Used to eat mad chips at the front of the week
Now I stack mad chips at the front of the week
And I got mad clips at the front of the Jeep
So don't get caught trying to sample the cheese, huh
Nacho like you can't have lactose
I stay with new shit like assholes
Smoke that weed, get buck like rascals
Niggas wanna pop, put them up like tadpoles

Ms. Banks, 18, all about the dough
Mocassins, zooted jeans and polo
Frank hat, 151 logo
In Soho, eyes low from the loco
Cause I hit that swish like a chokehold
Y'all just clowning, niggas straight Bozos
Still cherry lounging? Man that's an old flow
Please, I cop the new steez
A bitch don't dance? better do it for 5 g's
Niggas stay frontin' like their clothes worth somethin'
Well that looks like H&M to me
Run around town talking about a triple beam
And they getting cream and they got the nina
Done coined a misdemeanor
Felony money, that's my demeanor
I keep this cash like my eyelashes nigga, long and pretty
I get flyer than the next bitch do, and I never had to put one brick in the womb

Got a pack of swishers and a bag of purple by the tits
I like freaky-deaky shit, so a freaky bitch (keep uh...)
Big dick niggas at the top of my buddy list
Won't sex till ya lick my clit and tell me where the money is
Dumb birds, just occurred they get no words like sign language and shit

Get him for his Christian Diors

Niggas called the cops so we said ""Come in, chase us""
Jesting every fucking skater for his skateboard
Wearing BBC denim, nigga, I'mma take yours

Black tee, black hair, and my lip gloss clean
I move like scene when I dip across the abstract
Got makeup leave the ticket on the dash
I'm looking for the cash cause I'm tryna' cop the double-trunks
Boys act stupid so you know I've got to double-bump

You're a woman like no other
You lift me when I'm down and blue
You make me care for you every day
There's no other in my life but you
Yeah, yeah

You like the way Sevens stay up on my hip
But the nigga don't never got something in they clip
Grip-grip got the chrome zip aimed at your lip
Never seen a young bitch pop like this
Yup, and the niggas really like this
Nameplate in the middle of my nice tits
Diesel and I'm higher than your flight is
On Verde day y'all playin' where the kites is
Stay steamin' where the sites is
Y'all bitches still gleaming at the prices
See through females like a psychic
She's mad cause her man wanna pipe this
She could fuck around and get chopped into slices
Body parts in the gutter where the crap dice is
And that one'll be a cold case
They found her head, it was missing her whole face
See I'm a scratched CD, I really don't play
And I reach for the tech and spray
I spray just like Air Wick and Glade
But you won't smell white lilies and sage
Wow this little girl sounds insane
I've been listening to Wayne and piffing up the brain
Long black weave and a few gold chains
Semi-automatic and some real good aim


I spit heavy on the beat like I'm tryna' get the taste out
Them other niggas on it like they got the cake mouth
Seventeen,
 been hot since I came out
Got every whack rapper shaking like a change pouch
I make out then I send a nigga's face off
Then to the left, boy you gotta break out
Don't let the door hit you where the good lord split you
And the fifth will leave pool on the floor with you

Let a chick come to war, I'mma go get her
And feed her ass to my bitches like old dinner
Right off the bat I got ya nigga pullin' shit outta hat
Cuz I can look em in the face while I'm arching my back
Check his microphone
Suck the gristle off his bone
Like tryna quench your thirst to get your hands on his phone
That I don't condone
He's fucked up he ain't right
And a bitch is prone to lay back and take pipe
Fuck the drama I'm too pretty for a fist fight
Keep my money comin' and I keep all of my lips tight

Your tonque is sharp
But I miss the taste of it

If he if he wanna hit it
If he if he wanna hit it
If he if he wanna hit it)

I eat his cabbage like a savage then I'm sending it back
To his wife you ain't a lot of oxygen in his wallet
If you tryna fuck with Banks you better make a deposit
I be herpin' niggas early like they tryna cop Supreme hats
But I do switch up for the buck like homie let me see that
Always strap up for the fuck he could be where disease at
And a dude like us he can touch but I ain't tryna conceive that
You got them demons in you semen Nigga keep that
One drop of that white stuff can severly fuck my life up
And you know I keep my site up
And all I see is fetty
No I don't need no babies and no rabies in my belly
Adoption ain't an option; strap up or pack up
Try somethin' slick and get your dick hacked up
So you can either hit the door in peace
Or watchin' me hit the floor in pieces, believe this

Pussy be the x, but I don't pop pills
I put it on his top lip like ""Got milk?""
Wetter than the sea a nigga might need gills
The type of shit that make a dude wanna pay bills
Next thing you know he got me written in his will
And I'm waiting on the day that I can come off with the mill

The fake ID don't got a mistake
Miss Banks keeps these niggas caught up in a teen angst

Nigga, that's Down To Eat
'Cause I'm down to leave if you are a freak and
Parents left town for the weekend
We can do the freakin', keep sneakin'
Beep beep, and I hop in a whip

Been sittin' in his Levi, got a black four fifth
You can cock that shit and a bitch won't trip
Says I walk and talk and act like a lady
But he got me chilling at his crib like a baby
We hit the liquor, now he wanna lick her
YKK, he's on my zipper
He wanna tickle my fancy
And just go downtown like Delancey
So spit out ya gum
Let your tongue tip in nooks and crannies
And pass the panties

Keep these niggas eatin' at my diner
Turned twenty-two with the MAC eyeliner
Got curfew, so you better set the timer
Now
You got a girl goin' crazy
My hormones are going insane
Please top me off like Pizza Hut, baby
We can do it in the butt maybe... not
It's like, nigga, just playin'
All a bitch is really saying is
We can get a day and in
That passenger seat looks vacant
And if you wit' it, I'm yours for the takin'
So hey shawty, what it is
You settling the fizz
By just sittin' there and looking at it
Come take a sip of my Crush
Put your hand on my blush
Better keep it on the hush, uh

And a bunch of rude dudes from the east side
Rolled up curb side looks like a drive by
But the dark skinned one hops out
No doubt any moment he might pull a trigga
Constructs, antiques and a wife beater
Look at those six packs on a nigga and
He got big hands big feet
Like a Size thirteen, dick must be bigger
Than my boyfriend's - yeah, I got a boyfriend
But I'll lay him off if you wanna get employed
 and
I would prefer guys into streetwear

Got knots like a pack of cheap weave hair

Lets peruse the essentials a dude
A brief study of the bitch every nigga should persue
To make 'em feel flyer than coming out a cacoon
Will interlude in the nude and make a nigga some food
This is to allude to the dudes in soho
But I stay hood for the niggas and they solo
So i keep the booty in nudies, the 14 inch

I got the bud like rudy
Even white fellows wanna jump in the hot chocolate like marshmallows - get it?
I am delicious, so I cop them digits
Gas them up like civics
Then I hop like ribbit - yeah
Back to the back of the bus
I like king-size chocolate
Bars with nuts
And I got the ill sweet tooth
Couple cavities too
Hit a bitch up if you think you even need proof

That's the way that our love can grow, make the play and then not to slow

By the right index in that pink flesh

Learned how to get wet when I turned 11
Late night robin bird was heaven
I got a little porno obsession

Lick a clit like her, cause I prefer
To get stuffed up like animal
And let a nigga eat like cannibal

That gagging sounds explicit
Pull hard on my extensions, yeah
I gave head for a week or two
Went so long he was shocked like a Pikachu
And I'm on point, with a top like beetle do

the color of my fur is scary

Just my fur and not  a true reflection of what's inside
I spend my days watching the other cats finding someone to love them
Hoping and praying that the day would become my luckiest one yet!
But the hours accumulate,
And all of the cats have been chosen
And I'm the only one left
I feel so lonely
Lonely black cat
Little unloved black cat
But tomorrow is another day
So I must put on my brightest smile,

Big clocks I'm watching Benji's
Shake a nigga down to the last penny
Hot boxing the chopper
Big rocks chopped up
Loaded up choppa ready
Big clocks, big watches, big diamonds",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-wildin-out-lyrics
Bitch Is Ill,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I like to masturbate when a nigga just came
And it's just tight lame if he don't give brain
Procrastinate and play with the nipples
Touch it in the middle then pop it like a pimple
There's no debate, gotta do it, impress
By the right index in that pink flesh-
Yeah, nigga, im a vet
Learned how to get wet when I turned 11
Late night robin bird was heaven'
I got a little porno obsession
Now I got skills in the trade like stefan
If you got skills, we can trade like best friends
But I don't mind going solo, no homo, but I cum better dolo
Wish all dicks had a switch for turbo
Took batteries, and came in purple

Fuck me 
I can fuck you like a pornstar
Fuck me 
On your couch or in your mom's car
Fuck me 
Front shot, side shot, back shot, cum shot
Fuck me 
Aha aha aha aha
(dont stop)
(no no no Keep going)

Touch it, rub it, squeeze it, pull it
Hit it up with a silver bullet
Turn up the pinky, that bitch is freaky
Really can learn a few things from her
But I will not suck a tit like her
Lick a clit like her, cause I prefer
To get stuffed up like animal
And let a nigga eat like cannibal
Wax that ass like candle do
And gimme my spread like cancer do
Yeah, you better follow my format
Or get back to the steps and doormat
No jokes, no games
Yank my weave and scream my name
Say my name like a Ray-Ban frame
Keep that stiff like John McCain
Fuck me 
I can fuck you like a pornstar
Fuck me 
On your couch or in your mom's car
Fuck me 
Front shot, side shot, back shot, cum shot
Fuck me 
Aha aha aha aha

How much cum could a bad bitch suck
If a bad bitch could suck cum?
I splash like pools, I teach them students
Then I let 'em eat free lunch like school
Get up for the mission, get in position
I'm a suck it like Maggie Simpson
That gagging sounds explicit
Pull hard on my extensions, yeah
I gave head for a week or two
Went so long he was shocked like a Pikachu
And im on point, with a top like beetle do
I stay wide open like a jiggaboo
And the mascara is kinda poppin'
So a bitch ain't stoppin'
He shoots and then reloads
Tryna get it in the weave so I leap like toad",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-bitch-is-ill-lyrics
Movin’ On Up (Love Beats Rhymes Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Listen up, my nigga
Little sis, little KitKat
Kit never chip that chit
Less it's chit-chat
Haller here Bonita
On a jick jiggy jit-jat
Dollars for Chiquita
Get the gist?
Let me get that pricey diamond feisty niña
Icy diva, ¡ay que linda
Like nigga Swiss, rich like Geneva
I'm so eager, nice to meet ya
If you wanna pump that missile
You bitch better drip, better wet that whistle
Scripts in the jitch
Just the witch black sickle
In the crypt with the click, better flip that nickel
Fucking with the get 'em girl in the campaign gully
Spill that girl if you the champagne bunny
It's your world, live it up, it ain't nothing
Spend that girl and keep the damn thing running",https://genius.com/Azealia-banks-movin-on-up-love-beats-rhymes-version-lyrics
