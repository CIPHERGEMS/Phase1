Listen To Me Now,America Is Dying Slowly ,1996,"Artist: Eightball & MJG
Album: America Is Dying Slowly: A Red Hot Organization Compilation
Song: Listen To Me Now
Verse One:
I have no face, I have no body, I have no heart I have no soul
I don't care if you're young if you're old
Here's my mission, I'm out to get them, those who be slippin
Creepin, while they be creepin, I be enterin
Into them, silently, violently, that's not me
Quietly, you'll never know I'm in your blood stream
Swimming, I been injected, now you're infected
And when you find me here it will be worse than you expected
Temptation, that's how I get in, that's how I got in
Information, is what you lackin, now I'm attackin
Your mind, and body functions, don't seem to function
Somethin, ain't how it used to be and it's because of me
Killin you, cold-blooded murderer
The bible told the world I would be here and now I'm servin ya
Along with the floods mass destruction and wars
You can listen to me, but the choice is yours
Chorus: (sample from Goodie Mob's ""Cell Therapy"")
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should've had my jimmy hat strapped on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness it's more than just a song
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
Verse Two:
I got no concious, killing by the bunches, how can I see with no eyes?
Unprotected people I'm taking em by surprise, I despise
Any type of Doctor, thinking he can stop a
Epidemic built across the nation, can't stop temptation listen
Who in the hell gonna stop you when, I get in your mind then
Tell you squash where da girl done been, hit the broad from behind, I'm
All up in the walls of the womb, your doom is incognito
You constantly putting your life in my hands, thinking you didn't see no
Evidence that made it irrelevant I'm hangin out up in the system
On the scene mean stuffed in them jeans, is how she gets them
If it was up to me I'd get with you all, but I really don't pick em
How one by one she lures them in, I'm the one who tricks them
Your coffin sealer, temperature chiller, the silent killer
I done sucked up more life, twice the sales of Mike's Thriller
If a victim want to be loved, gun and will travel
Anywhere with any broad or buster now you in gravel need to
Chorus:
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I shoulda told him to put a condom on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness it's more than just a song man
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cutting corners in your bones
Verse Three:
Lord tell me why was I born in the days of bloodshed
Plagues and neighborhoods full of the walking dead
Poison is cooked, and smoked, and shot into our veins
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous echo through our brains
Misguided, the big picture over the small picture
That's how the devil makes a man interpretate the scripture
Rotten, born dead into a sea of sinners
Young girls are pros, before they can become beginners
Booty shakers sellin sex to pay they college tuition
Jealousy, send our brothers on straight pistol missions
And in the midst of the drama mama can I save ya
Now you remember all the hell she went through tryin ta raise ya
But it's too late for that, in this predicament
You shoulda been thinking of this when you was flickin it, stickin it
But who am I? Just another man running his mouth
Giving you something to think about, my time is up, I'm out
If you ain't realized by now, the description of the topic here is AIDS
Several amounts of times I will appear on the front page
Never be thinking about the filthy hoes in which I've laid
Down deep in the dungeons next to the devil is where I stayed
Never be thinking about the backs I rode and what I weighed
Now everything that's important in your life is just a daze
Being a damn fool trying to prove you wasn't afraid
Wasn't intending to do it but yet and still at times you made
Moves within the game that should never have been played
Whether you old or whether it struck you at an early age
No difference between the two, cause they both in the same stage
Curiosity killed the cat the cat was standin in front of the gauge
It seems the whole subject keeps the world within a daze
Well this is the fact
That some of these people be thinkin they can't be fazed
Worldwide plague slowly turning into a rage
Up and down side to side heterosex and gays need to
Chorus:
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should've had my jimmy hat strapped on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness, it's more than just a song man
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should have told him to put a condom on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness, it's more than just a song
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-listen-to-me-now-lyrics
Not Tonight,Around The World In A Day,2007,"Eightball:
Close your eyes image just you and I alone
No instigators or player haters in our zone
It's on, we bone like two high school kids
Breathing fast pumpin' hard through the night and then
Watch the sun rise cheefin' on a cigarillo
Urge got your head feeling fluffy like a pillow
You know, what I like ain't no sense in hesitating
Sex for breakfast forget the eggs and the bacon
Leave you shakin', wishing I could be your man
In the park holding hands with the kids in the van
On a sunday eating icecream at the zoo
And everything I do, in someway involves you
I be a crazy man to tell you no if you asked
That don't mean I'm gonna be your trick and spend all my cash
On your ass, but we can chill and do it right
But that husband and wife hype baby not tonight
Hook:
Living a players life, woah I be everywhere
Meeting all kind of women but ooh I'm playin' too hard to get
We can wine and dine till the morning light
But if you're trying to keep me baby I can do it not tonight
MJG:
Are you prepared for the creep 5 or sleep by
So ain't no need for you to teach I we each lie
Amoungst the sheets, and curiosity now waht you gone do?
Your clothes recieved by my butler that's providing for you
The luxury of my cottage covered up in the cut
Look ou the window baby lakeside, swans and ducks
Way outta touch with that fast lane
Keepin' it slow not here to critize
The last man brother for fo sho' it's time
You know baby space ain't hard to find
And eventually you gonna want yours like I'm a need mine
Indeed I'm impressed by your charism and charm
Everytime we do our thang you straight deliver the bomb
You got me sprung, sometimes but not I'm shakin' it off
Let's put some slack up in this thang instead of breakin' it off
The chandalears in the atmosphere doin' me nice
But I told you once don't make me tell you twice
Baby read me lips, not tonight
Hook
Eightball:
You be all in my mix talkin' bout ""I be your fix""
Baby I ain't in the mood for no games and tricks
I got game, but I ain't ever had one like you
I mean one like you that makes me do what I do
But I don't wanna be your man or your confidon
If you don't fake the funk with me baby I won't front
Makin' love to a body in the dark is cool
And it's gone be somebody else if it don't be you
MJG:
True, laced out in pure silk my mind don't tilt
I got the AC kinda bumpn' cover yourself with this quilt
Now free your mind, time like this is good but understand
I'm a man of plenty thangs and plenty plans
Rather than, your average, sit around do nothing brother
Stuck on having his
Wrong way one way or the other, the vibe was right
Your laid back conversation was tight
So was the candle light the cruise and the flights
But not tonight

In the Wind,Around The World In A Day,2007,"Artist: Eightball and MJG
Album:  How to Be a Player soundtrack
Song:   In the Wind
Verse One: MJG
Here comes the one they call the P.I. -- M.P
Straight out the cut no one can see I -- bust these
Way out of touch with all them bustas in my rear view
But see they game, so lame, I can hear through
I Hens doggin at the bar, actin real nice (real nice)
Six pack of Hen, straight up, with no ice -- tap me twice
Did you really want my full attention?
Sometimes my mind (intertwine) with the tenth dimension
I see you inchin to my ride, tired, rest them legs
Soon as you open up your mouth (uhh) there's the head
Now who I be, MJG, certified, mic controller
(Uncle Sam, I want you!) Trick bend over
I'm a petrified rapper talkin, and you ain't nuttin
But an electrified shyster walkin, I'm tired of savin
People from takin these dead end trips, I'mma just go
And bust this champagne upside your ship, alright you hip?
You in a hurry?  You can't relate?
Don't ever say that I ain't try to set it to you straight
I'm out the gate before you hate but I'll be back again
You saw me faintly through the crowd but now I'm in the wind
Once again
Chorus: Eightball and MJG
In the wind, it's a bird, it's a plane
Now it be them hustlers with that skin tight game
In your mix, scopin you, scopin me
Eightball and MJG to the end, bustas we in the wind
Verse Two: Eightball
I sold my soul to this hustle, homeboy scratch what you heard
T front me a keyboard, I flipped it like a bird, word
On them streets be them Suave House beats
In the Benz blowin Sweets got your gal between my sheets
Speak -- I ain't have to say one little thang
The fame of my name blew the ghetto freak brain
Lookin for a meal ticket, she let me stick it
Wicked when she lick it, tryin to make me trick it
Girl, when I was broke it seemed all about the luxury
Now I got cheese, I got a pay a girl to love with me
But I'm a jelly worker, like Smuckers
Workin against them suckers, big facin just to love a
Broad that done been around the world in a day
Bear lovin whoever got cheddar to pay
Ball like no trick ass, them shakers if I tip
I be drunk, in the club, smokin sticky cat nip
Slip, as if a banana peel was dropped in my path
Into a body bodyworkin not discussin no math
Playa haters all around me as I stumble and grin
Snatch my vest, twist somethin, hit the rumble and then...
Chorus 2X
Verse Three: MJG, Eightball
I flip scripts on young dips who think they hip
Smoke up your whole zip, sess hydro or crip
Time and time again, stories have been told
About the super hustler dyin tryin to get the gold
Concrete jungle full of, carniverous firearm
Hunger for flesh, and pray on who ain't strong
Heavy weighters, with plenty hoes that buy em alligators
In the wind, breakin all big ?
Pick artificial tricks stolen money makers
Money trees come in please, help a player shake a
Million down to the ground, feel them hits fall
Ride with me I'll run your game into a brick wall, trick y'all
Is what this false literary do, then reality come
(and snatch the natural dust out you) who speaks the truth?
Whose your leeches?  Whose your friends?
I plan to bring the realness back again, but until then
I'm in the wind

Think I got no killin utensils

Just as long as a mothafucka pay me what I weight
Hate in my bloodstream
Smoked out dreams
Shoot raps through my vein like a nigga was a fiend
I told yall niggas we was hard from the start
Keep enough shit yo blow ya block apart
Just to say I did that
You know who did that
That nigga everybody know
He in the fat pack
Moet if it was fly nigga I said it
You might regret it if you wet it
And you need a medic

Take a Picture,Classic Pimpin’ (Live),2018,"CoryMo

We came here to rock this bitch and make the people get up
Put your cellphones up into the air and take a picture
Afterparty and we takin' everybody with us
Everybody smokin', everybody drinkin' liquor
We be comin' down, we be in the drop top
We be comin' down, we be in the drop top
Afterparty and we takin' everybody with us
Everybody smokin', everybody drinkin' liquor

R-E-A-L, I would never be F-A-K-E
F-A-T-B-O-Y, standin' ten toes down from Tennessee
Weed stickin' to my fingers, I love how the smell lingers
Studio, we making bangers, pimp poetic, fuckin' genius
Whatever the track, I'm wrappin' it up like I'm wrappin' a pack
You niggas is wack, my vocabulary is bigger than Shaq
I go in my sack, pull out a bud and roll up a mack
Pull up in Jack, call Stokes and jump in the 'Lac
Rap just a tad, my flow come out like chopper bullets
Never stoppin' once you pull it, people screaming when they hear me
Dead rappers droppin', put 'em on a t-shirt, line up them cars
Call a nigga mama, shouldn't have got me started
MJ with me, been one hundred since back in the days with me
Blaze with me, run the streets and on the stage with me
Tippin' through, how you do
Grip that green, dip that scene
Pimpin' mean, simply clean
Thicker than a pint of lean

We came here to rock this bitch and make the people get up
Put your cellphones up into the air and take a picture
Afterparty and we takin' everybody with us
Everybody smokin', everybody drinkin' liquor
We be comin' down, we be in the drop top
We be comin' down, we be in the drop top
Afterparty and we takin' everybody with us
Everybody smokin', everybody drinkin' liquor

Standing in front of these cameras, snapshot, take a picture
Tell your girlfriend to tell her girlfriend's girlfriend to bring her with her
Now you say no and we say naw
And you say us and we say y'all
I got enough room in the back of the bus
If they rollin' with us, we can take 'em all
On the highway, wreckin' all day
We can roll up so low-key, baby, windows tinted
Put the MAC down, let my sack down
And the way I mack to a bitch is gonna put me back in it
One ho helpin', need to snap right back
I'm the only nigga spit a rap like that
Pimp tight, MJG, put pimp niggas on the map like that
Orange Mound, Memphis, Tenn
Makin' easy money pimpin' hoes again
Been in this game for a minute
A lot of you haters wish that we would throw it in
The towel, but how would the game really be
Without real niggas in it? Then what would it be?
A world without no Ball and G?
You kiddin', right? You fuckin' with me
That's why we do this for the love at first
But sometimes you find out that love, it hurts
But now I gotta make a lot of money with it
Show me where it's at and I'ma run and get it
Go and get them concert tickets
Bitches get in free 'til 12
Everybody get up, light this bitch up
Let's get fucking wild as hell

We came here to rock this bitch and make the people get up
Put your cellphones up into the air and take a picture
Afterparty and we takin' everybody with us
Everybody smokin', everybody drinkin' liquor

Pimps,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"Ahhhh yeaaaaaaaaah
Eightball & MJG in the muthafuckin' house
And we came here today to talk to you about this thing called pimpin'
It has been misunderstood over the years
So now we have come to set the record straight
Niggas don't do this shit right
It takes a special kind of nigga
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah

It takes a nigga that's hard from the start, you gotta have heart
To meet a bitch, mack her down, then rip her apart
It's all in the game, a nigga can't change
If you don't break a bitch, then your game is lame, mayne
See, I'm from Tennessee, with curls and gold teeth
So everywhere I go, bitches strike up conversations wit' me
About the way I talk, about the way I dress
About how my gold teeth look so fresh
See, how I bait 'em in, soon as a nigga speak
That deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
I'm in my Cadillac, chillin' like a fat mack
Smoking on a fat sack, drinkin' on a pint of 'gnac
I pick up my car phone 'cause the freak beeped
It's my nigga baby mama, but sometimes I creep
That's just the way it is, niggas have to take a chance
When you ain't around, anybody could be in that ass
But I'm just a young nigga tryna make a dollar
And they way I live, to some it's hard to swallow
See, livin' down south ain't what you think it be
Nine times out of ten niggas like me
Pimps

Yeah, that's right
We trying to teach all these lames, you know
How to do this shit
'Cause it's really a hard job
But them lame niggas
They make me get so high

And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(I get so high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

Now let me explain a pimp, a nigga about the M-O-N-E-Y
See a ho, break a ho
And try to influence the bitch to turn a trick for the nigga who
Persuaded her to sell ass like hoes supposed to
Now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin'
Surrounded by all these hoes, that's goin' and givin' me money?
It's funny how a ho can make you think she wit' ya
When all the time, she's just another nigga's gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
Take care of your business, bring me the money
Yeah, this shit is thick
Ho, don't violate, bitch, you know I taught you better
Take all his cash, grab on his ass, write that trick a love letter
Train your woman to break a man—""man"" meaning another nigga
Just some shit in the game, same ol' same to make your pimpin' thicker
Slicker the pimpin' gets, freakier gets the bitch
MJG is rich, I'm coo-coo for these tricks
I pimp

Yeah, that's right, baby, I pimp
So uh, what you need to do, you need to sit dat ass there
And uh, right about now, I'm 'bout to fire up one of these spliffs
And get so high

And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(Ah shit, so high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

Part 2, it's all the same, G
Trying to school fools, on this P-I-M-P
Lesson one: First you should pull a bitch, fuck her good
Next time tell her no, the next time, take her dough
Oh, you better watch your back, too, mayne
'Cause there's a lot of bitches in the world wit' much game
Lesson two: Watch that ho, don't trust her wit' none of yo' dough
Never let a bitch know, how you make your cash flow
Lesson three: If you don't tell that ho who is boss
Bitches like to run shit, but end up getting smacked in the mouth
See, a real nigga believe in beatin' them hoes down
Push her head into the wall 'til you hear that crackin' sound
Drown in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
Some niggas get pussy-whupped and fall into a love bugs
Buying hoes this, buying hoes that
Then bragging to your friends how you fucked her from back
Never how you took they cash, never how you beat they ass
Never how you pull hoes, fuck 'em then drop 'em fast
I don't understand your plan at all, man
But you should be around niggas like me
Pimps

Yeah, man, these niggas a trip, you know what I'm sayin'
But niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs
To get my mind off that shit
And when I smoke 'em, I get so high

And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(You know I stay high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

Wherever there is a ho, there's bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt
A sucker will spend his money 'til he ain't got nothin' left
Instead of blaming the bitch, he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldn't be a ho if it wasn't for the tricks
But I suggest we keep 'em so a pimp can keep his bitch
It need to be understood, there wouldn't be one without the other
So why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka?
Jealous sucker just maaaaad
They can't hang with the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimp's game
How in the fuck do you figure that pimpin' is dead when, nigga, you know it's alive?
Pimpin' is misunderstood by those who can't, that's why they said it died
Others tried pimpin', but was only makin' chump change
One track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
Rearrange shit that they done seen in a movie script
Damn, ain't that a bitch, niggas like me
Pimp

MJ-fuckin'-G, P-I-M-P
Staying down on this pimpin' 'bout these hoes
But some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
And that shit just makes me get so high

And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
(Ah yeah, I get so fuckin' high)
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
And I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-pimps-lyrics

Tight grip on the tech-9, now it's time to creep
Hollow tips, in the clip, puttin' suckas in a deep sleep
Win, lose, or draw yo gat
Die if you ain't quick enough
Or end up at 201
Just because you think you tough
Niggas in the med, now they dead, from the uzi round
Trick was found, bloody on the ground, down in orange mound
Hole, in his dome, from the chrome, dat my hand held
Cuts, on the hoe, where I whooped 'em with da fanbelt
Bitches think i'm soft, cuz I treat them with respect
But I won't hesitate to smoke a bitch wit my tech
9 millimeta beata if I feel dat I should hit that ho
Smack, step back, & watch that ho hit the floor
Niggas on the gank might do better at a bank
Cuz i'm packin' what you lackin' and i'm shootin' like a tank
Its the p.i.m.p-ah
The funky m.c.-ah
The niggas dats droppin dem bitches wit my 9 millimeta
1 little, 2 little, 3 little tricks

9 little millimeta nigga, how you figure
Its a chance, talkin shit, wit ya gun in ya pants
I'm'a step on your ass like a stepbrother
Looks as if to me dat you a mothafuckin death lover
Weak ass boy, wit a toy on da street
Cappin on the right mothafucka til he meet
The wrong mothafuckin pimp tight, operator
Who shoot a nigga first, and then reason wit em later
Now punks, trip me out, wit a gun and no clip
Catchin nothin but a charge cuz he wanna be hip- but ya slipped
Anyway, when ya left witout ya bullets
Now be a stupid fool, reach for it then pull it
But you ain't, cuz u can't, pull a gun wit no ammo
You thinkn you can beat it but you know you ain't rambo
So its best you try to beg for ya life to stay alive
Cuz tricks, gettin dey dome blown away wit 25
And all about da popppin me a clip in get hip
You betta pack yo bags, cuz you goin on a trip
Dis shit is thick as heinz, and da shit is gettin thicker. . .for da 9 little millimeta nigga

Is there a doctor in the house?? (shit, I’m hit)
Damn, I think I’m dyin (shit, I’m hit)
Please call the doctor! (shit, I’m hit)
(8ball)
The mothafuckin pigs wanna fuck up da game
Sending niggas to jail, because dey sell cocaine
Rocks of crack, make stacks of dead presidents
Junkies fiendin for a hit, fucks up my residence
5-o, creepin tryna catch a nigga serve one
Thats, when I got my mothafuckin shotgun
Niggas in da bushes tryna rob me for what I got
Watch dem bitches scatter when I unload, da buckshots
Jack- or be jacked, creep- or get creeped on
But nigga don't step wrong, cuz 8ball keep a tone
And if ya shoot at me I hope ya hit me and kill me dead
Cuz if I dont die, I’m puttin a hole in yo fuckin head
Scandalous hoes, love a nigga dats beldum
Play dat innocent role, and have a nigga fucked up
She'll suck ya dick and then ya fall in love
While ya at home sleepin, she sellin pussy at da club
But look here hoes, I won't go out like a punk bitch
It takes more to get me, den fuckin and suckin dick
Dont disrespect me, cuz ho I’m the truth
9 little millimeta niggas smoke bitches too

I tote a mothafuckin tone, when I gotta roam, cuz pimps dont play
And I gotta stay, where young black niggas obey
Some kinda rule or strategy, cuz I can't be havin the
Shit from no nigga who think his tone is backin me
Away from da shit he talk, da shit ain't worth bein heard
I’m thinkin bout cappin domes, you ain't shootin shit but birds
For nigas who totin shanks, I hope you young niggas think
To creep from a pimps backside before you take his bank
Cuz I ain't no mothafuckin target, ain't no use of startin dis shit
Wit a nigga who legit, smokin bud by da pound, orange mound is my stomping ground
Dats where I’m found, and all da niggas who down
They gonna step when I step, jump when I jump
Ima be throwin boom, dey gone be shootin pumps
Havin a mothafuckin tone, really, really, really, ain't shit to me
It’s just another fuckin responsibility
But weak niggas like em turn crumbs into bricks

Mr. Big,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"Now, I was broke as a muthafucka, my life at the end see
My so called friends, they had no ends to lend me
My job at Mickie Ds was fuckin' me with no grease
I worked so fuckin' hard, but the money, it never increased
I quit my fuckin job, I had no job nigga
Put on the mask, get the gloc, it's time to rob nigga
I hit the streets, but no victim had been chosen
Damn I was nervous, but my fear wouldn't stop my strollin
Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I was struck
I felt the burn of bullets, so I knew I had got bucked
Reachin for my tech, the bullets hit me in my chest
My eyes closed shut, and I thought I seen death
I woke up at the med still woozy from my jackin
T-Money walked in and he told me what had happened
I knew him from the hood, but I did not know him well
He drove a red jag, and I knew that he was bale
He said he was rollin when he seen me in distress
He said he killed the muthafuckin niggas with his tech
He offered me a job said he'd front me what I needed
I said that I was with it dreamin one day I would be..
Mr. Big!

Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, they call him Mr. Big
Mr. Big, Mr. Big, but not because of my size

I hit the street slanging yayo, then I sold up my block
Sellin 8, sellin deals, sellin $20 rocks
Sellin dimes, sellin nickels to the junkies on my tracks
Gettin my dick sucked with the crumbs from the crack
Some nigga tried to jack me, but he only had a knife
A clip full of hollow tips took the bitches' life
Standin on the track, my mobile rung and it was T
""Hello?"" -- ""Yo Eight, be the fuck aroung 3"" --""Aight!""
I met him at the park, he had a job for me again
Rob some Columbians, and get my ass in
Hit for 30 birds, if I live, I'd get five
I smoked them damn Columbians, and then got what was mine
Over time, my clientel rappidly increased
My bank got bigger, that's when bitches started jockin me
Cars and clothes had me fuckin different hoes
A fat bank roll was keepin me cool with the 5-O
I had niggas workin under me to take the heat
I never touched the dope, makin a 100 Gs a week
I gained respect, I'm the biggest playa of all time
Don't ever fuck with me, cause I'm ...
Mr. Big!
Repeat chorus:

Chillin at the club with T-Money and J-B
Lil Adrian and Boo, and my nigga, MJG
I had the bitches staring at the twinkle of my diamonds
Drinkin on this Yak, makin my way to the back
When I saw this little bitch lookin finer than the rest
With a long black weave and a tight red dress
I started conversatin, but she didn't want to talk to me
Straight up to the hotel room, now the bitch is suckin the
Dick of this nigga that is smarter than the bitch thank
Then she got up, now somethin in the air stank
She went in the bathroom and locked the door behind her
I got off the bed and grabbed the tech from the dresser
Stood by the door when it opened, niggas came out
Grab my muthafuckin gun, ""Hey nigga!"" *pow pow*
Then, I grabbed the girl cause some more niggas had busted in
Shot that bitch in the dome with my muthafuckin chrome
Shot up all the niggas, but I took one in the leg
When the cops busted in, I was laying on the bed
Walked up out the room, did I go to jail?
Hell no! They can't stop me..
Long live Mr. Big Ho!!!!

Comin’ Out Hard,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"Eightball will come out hard with the gangsta lean
Gold smile for the women that be jockin' the green
I'm a pimpster, not a trick on a stroll
Ya gotta pimp that thang and keep a trick on hold
Stay on top of the world, wit a gun in ya hand
Take control of a woman and fear no man
It be hard for me to see a day without cash
If you got it and I don't I'll blast your ass
With the quickness Because a pimp don't play
I got to work on my game and think of ways to get payed
Born in the Mound, down, deep in the South
With the brothers with the curls and gold teeth in they mouth
In the Cheverolet Impalas with the Cragars and Vogues
Four deep with the yak, smokin' fat mac indo
Fall up in the club with the pimp's baton
Got a Tec in my pants, ya step to me and it's on
Got a family in Memphis, got a gang in Texas
T-Money in the Jag and JB in the Lexus
Flex this pimp tight mind in the studio

MJG description a brotha
And one who tends to always keep his business undercover
But still I wind up in the middle of a click
Some I heard, he heard, she heard
Should I continue to listen to the rumors, the garbage
Trick I ain't barring this, sucka let's start this rumble
Swing trick, you missed, I hit, tumble, into the sleeper
Now you feeling weaker
Man don't step when you think you got backup
Looking for some help but ya boys just slacked up
Punked out, backed out
Way low headin' to the front do'
Sneaking out real slow
How ya feel now?
What's wrong, what's the matter
Mama never told you not to play with those rappers
MJG got loose in the 9 deuce
But for the 9 tre the pimps don't play way
I'mma stay true
Some of ya'll goin' trade
Some of ya'll I'mma like
Some of ya'll I'mma hate
But see I'm in it to win it
Not in it for a part
And it's considered a job, for me to come out, damn, hard

Hard out, Hard out
Comin' out, Hard
Hard out, Hard out
Hard
Hard out, Hard out
Comin' out, hard
Hard out, Hard out

I gotta come out hard as hell just like the life I lead
Cool, feed on the next brotha's greed
J-Smooth cuttin' up, lil' Hank gettin' buck
Killers be shootin' up suckas with no gut
I'm scoping big bucks, looking for the payoff
Living like a pimpster, taking everyday off
Riding through the hood with my homies gettin' smoked out
Fall up in the mall, on a ho stroll, loked out
Cool, calm and collective, comin' out hard
MJG count it down

1, 2, 3 points I gotta get across
1, don't
2, make me
3, go off
Suckas gettin' stuck up in a phase
Tryin' to amaze, somebody else, but they find that it don't pay
I'm gonna keep, droppin' tracks, smokin fat-mack hay
In the ash tray, 3 quarts, put away
Gat on the table cause I'mma able, I'mma keep it
Right up on the shelf, where I know that I can reach it
My mind is a weapon, cause I'm smart from the start

The First Episode,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"Pimpin hoes was some shit that came easy to a playa
Cause ain't no way in hell a bitch could get me to obey her
And how in the fuck I'll ever make some money if I pay her
My hoes sell pussy at the party for the mayor
400 for the chewin, 100 for the mackin
1,000 for the fucking, 200 for the jackin
Soon as the day is over, my bitch is checkin in
I'ts just like deja vu, again and then again bitch

Come on, Wait a minute MR. MJG
Do you really think anyone's gonna believe that pimpin shit
Huh, I guess not
Haven't you heard, that pimpin shit is dead

Bitch chill, Hold up, you got a pimp fucked up
Can't help it cause you don't know, ain't my fault that you stuck up
Ya parents didn't teach ya, the streets didn't reach ya
I'm makin easy money from the judge and the preacher
The mayor likes the bitches cause they beat him with a chain
The judge and the preacher love to hear dirty thangs
The governor is first on the bitch payin list
He busts a nut soon as the bitches touch his dick

Comin out smooth,
 limpin' like a pimpsta
Got a fleet of bitches and they all call me mista fat mac
Pimp tight, what the fuck you wanna do?
See me in the street-sweeper mowin' down you and your crew
Gotta be ruthless, smackin hoes toothless
Suckas gettin dropped when I'm poppin with the Glock bitch
And the niggas they high cap and act like hoes
When they see the 93 with the switches and the voes

Eightball, tell the truth
How yo fat ass goin be doin all that?
Talkin bout pimpin and shootin up niggas
And braggin bout fuckin, what'z up wit that?

I'm big as a motherfucker, I don't look fast
But I'll jump up quick, and stick my dick in yo ass
And for you niggas that talk shit, don't step too quick
You know who got my back, a clip full of hollow tips
Tec, 9 millimeter, Glock or 22
Mafia style, don't even fuck with the pimpsta crew
Bust the yak and pass me that bud sack
Cause niggas with nuts, can't even fuck with the fat mac

25 birds on the counter in the den
Nigga gettin bailed cause they go for 5-10
Pot good and hot now I'm lookin for the shaker
Water start to bubble sprinkle in the money maker
The shit is gettin thick I think my pager just exploded
11 birds left, 13 I just sold it
I gotta close shop before it get too fuckin late
Ho sell time sellin birds 12-8

You know you guys really shouldn't be sellin cocaine to other brothers
It's killin us all off man
I mean how is that supposed to look
Makin us look bad

The cops work for me cause I keep good stuff
And plus the government ain't never paid dem tricks enough
And every time a cop bust some dope in the drug rade
Feds swangin birds in the hood by the next day
While I'm makin money off the shit that I done fronted
Nigga fell short, shoot 'em up yeah I done it
MJG Pushin real not cut
Got the feds in my pocket, and the chief by his nuts

Roll a fat bud, smoke the bitch and then I'm chilled
Fall off in the club drinkin yak dressed to kill
Niggas that be jealous cause dem hoes be on the jock
Don't disrespect my pimpin or you I will have to drop
No I don't be playin, what I'm sayin what I speak
Some niggas don't understand then I have to go and teach
What Eightball is about and what the future got for me
A slew of dead niggas and a pocket full of grip G

Damn, Father just like some niggas man
Dem niggas ain't goin never be shit
Dem niggas forever gettin fucked up { laughs }
Know what I'm sayin, dem fools was stuck

Punk ass niggas that talk shit can get down on their knees
Suave got the hook up cause suave got the cheese
And I got the bomb and MJG is in the tank
Posessin ya mind and then we blow up the bank
Yank yo ho from the front row, and then jet out
When we get to the hotel, your bitch is on the house
Fuckin and suckin a pimpsta, fuckin and suckin a pimpsta

Nigga’s Like Us,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"Rollin' down Park Avenue bumpin' Maze
My Caddy with them switches, got them bitches in a daze
Niggas on the gank, smokin' dank, goin' nuts
And all I see is dope and dead niggas bloody guts
Sometimes I go and click and smack my bitch up with the gat
Or blow up niggas cars, cause I heard they call me fat
No I'm not a wimp, cause the pimp is in my nature
I got too many hoes bein' a raper ain't my flavor
I'mma dope seller, stick 'em up, killer or whatever
Game from slangin' birds, 211 or 187
Smack up my bitches on the street that owe me ends
Learn from the start, in the game ain't no friends
Just a lot of bitches with they hands out (Whatsup with that?)
Smilin' in my fuckin' face, stabbin' me in my fuckin' back
All up in my business, whatsup with my grip bitch?
Steppin' up, one nigga died with a mouth full of pimp shit
Whatsup with the bitches Eight? Whatsup with the bitches Eight?
Fuck me, suck me, jack me, 'til my diggidy-dick ejaculate
Whatsup with niggas Eight? Whatsup with the niggas Eight?

I'm reachin' for the pump and the loaded automatic
It's 6/5 bombs from the box in the attic
A phone call from Eightball let me know the scope
T-Money and J.B. had to scope a young ho
Not a true bitch, but a true bitch nigga
We rollin' thick as hell so how the fuck that nigga figure?
His gun nor his gang is gonna be a threat to us
With one fire bomb one gang bit the dust
And the nigga down with me said ""Damn G, you didn't have to gank him!""
And at that very moment, he was askin' me to shank him
A nigga ain't suppose to smoke a trick and get sad
And thats the first example of a killer goin' bad
I gotta take him out, if he live he'll confess
So Eightball you ready?(Yeah)
Shoot him in the chest (I got him)
One mo' motherfucker dead over bullshit
Guess he didn't really know the niggas he was runnin' with

Eightball you got me covered mane?

Let these bastards know that
We don't bar no fuckin' blood stains
What about my pimpin'?
Is it strong?
Hell yeah nigga!
Got a lot of bitches?
Got a gang, and it's gettin' bigger
Bigger than a Mack J, smooth like a 5th of 'gnac
Let 'em know we deadly G
As deadly as a hit of crack
Straight from my gun to yo head
Then we got ya
Cut a nigga throat, naw that's another chapter
Kickin' ass
Makin' stiches
Smokin' bud
Fuckin' bitches lipstick on my dick
From the suckin' and the kissin'
She was kissin' on a fat dick!
Could it be a fat bitch
All up on my niggy-nuts, talkin' that love shit
Ain't no use in startin' shit
Ain't no use in tryin' to fuss
Bitches can't fuck with some niggas like us

Armed Robbery ’93,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"(MJG)
Now I was clicking out my barrel just to see if it was loaded
Checking out it’s bullets to make sure it won’t explode this
Hand around of the handle of my snub-nosed steel
I must be for real in the procedure for a kill
Stood around the corner while I cased out the bank
Busted in the door and stuck the guard wit' a shank
Ran up to the counter pulled the gun out wit' the quickness
Shot the bank teller so it wouldn’t be a witness
Fled out the door with the money in my left hand
Steel in my right hand running like a wild man
Ran to the hideaway knowing they was after me
Burned out my id stole a jeep Cherokee
Couldn’t be late for my trip to Jamaica
Heading to the river scheming up on how to take a
Boat from a victim, rush right up and stick him
With a sharp object making sure that I get him
Pulled up to the river scene nervous as a lunatic
Jumped out of the vehicle and spotted me a boat quick
Jumped on with the gun, saw the owner break and run
Shot him in the back with the gat like in Vietnam
Quickly making waves in the river as I bailed fast
Got about a mile in the boat ran out of gas
Oh no Joe! the cops can’t get me…
Ill never be wanted for armed robbery
(Eightball)
On the other side of town
Moving quickly rolling swiftly in the hoopty ride
Loading up the nine cause there just my be a homicide
MJG know the plan so the shit is on
By the time 5-0 come we’ll be through and gone
Got to the area, stop then took a glance
Puttin' on my ski mask, stuffing the gat in my pants
Wells Fargo right on time, now it’s time for the crime
Do the crime waste no time then I'm going to get mine
Waited for the door to open shot the first trick I saw
Then shot the other fool I ain’t thinking ‘bout no law
Jumped in the truck put the pedal to the metal
Then fired up a square man doing about 110
Looking in my rear-view 5-0 everywhere
Messing up my plans with them helicopters in the air
Headed for the airport, wait I see a road block
Hit the gas even harder fool I ain’t gonna stop
Crash through the road block they ain’t gonna get me yet
J-Smooth waiting at the airport in a private jet
Jumped out of the truck with fast pigs right behind my ass
Running trying to shoot my nine holding bags full of cash
Jumped on the jet now we set to hit the runway
Took to the air yea I got away scott-free
Fired up a Mac j pigs didn’t catch me
Countin all my money from a strong armed robbery…
(MJG)
You think it’s over but it ain’t
Cause I can’t get caught by authority
The camera at the bank got me ganked so they know it’s me
Reached for artillery, put the shank in my mouth
Dove off the boat to the river and I bailed out
Swam like a fish greeted land with a kiss
Did I hit or did I miss well it goes like this
I put the money in the spot
Took the clothes that I got
Tied them up in the bag same place I put the mask
Changed clothes in between spot A and spot C
The designated area we call spot B
See I can’t be broke so I come up with a plan
Demand money, soon as they hand it over
Get up and jet  the set
The longer you stay the quicker you get arrested
MJG tested his strategy..
Wit' a slick armed robbery
(Eightball)
Flying through the air on my way to Jamaica
Thinking about why I took the money for the sake of
Me living poor and wishing to be richer
And just like Picasso I had to paint a picture
Of people dying rapidly, trying to imprison me
Just because I took a little money in a robbery
Landed in Jamaica chilling with the dreads
Smoking on the ganja, messing with my head
The feds came behind me hit me with a billy club
I fell to the ground, turned around pumping slugs
Jumped up quick, ditched the gun as I ran away
Ran to the hills where I hid for a few days
No, I'm not the one that they will catch soon
Bought me a palace in the hills wit' a hundred rooms
I got the money, got the women, got the B-U-D
I plead guilty to armed robbery!",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-armed-robbery-93-lyrics
Pimps in the House,Comin’ Out Hard,1993,"1 to the muthafuckin 2 to the muthafuckin 3
The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could It be
The pimps could rule the nation in '93'
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick, out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the ? comin on
So open the Crown
, down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what I'm sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggas be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin ain't dead yet, see pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you ain't shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But it's time to switch it up, unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it, complete and pick it
It's a book with hard covers thats packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system, step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now I'm runnin thangs, my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game, thangs are bound to show
Cuz a pimp got a stroke, and a wimp can't flow
And I ain't no muthafuckin fall guy, but I'mma try hard
To let you know this pimpin ain't gone never die

I ain't got nothing but time
So I'mma get out on these cuts and grind
Keep my mind on cloud twenty-nine
My player ways keep me with plenty dimes
See I'mma shine like all six of my gold teeth
When a nigga get through cooking up this O-Z
All night on the block 'til the sun rise
My only friend is a Glock with the 4-5
Four, five in the mornin', it don't stop
Daydreamin' 'bout flossin' a drop top 
(woop)
Blue lights snap me back to reality
I hit the alley quick and toss what I got on me
Tricks ain't got shit to do but harass
Searched a nigga and took about a three in cash
I guess that's better than gettin locked up
Or gettin jammed with that shit I had rocked up, huh!
[Chorus: MJG + 
Eightball

Now I heard that the South is where yo' folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back, way back
And now they wonder why we act, how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys, and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein' in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up

I got a maid cooking grits with a, outfit
So tight my niggas wanna stay the whole nite
Dice game in the kitchen, nigga,

Ham sam'ich in the driveway, drop top
Naked women in the den playing, hop scotch
Thirty bustas in my yard, they be, long gone
So hit me and I'mma keep my, phone on
I be out turning corners, dranking, one fifth
Got some scratches on my rims, 'cause of one dip
Met a broad yesterday, she hit me, ten times
If I diss her it'll take a nigga, ten lines

You can have all the bitches, 'cause I, don't hold
On to any woman like a human handcuff

Y'all just might see the skunk guy, with a girl who chunked thighed
Below the Mason-Dixon line

real niggas know what I'm talkin' about
From Texas, Atlanta, oh man, Alabama, Savannah
The deeper, the darker, the Dirty South is what I'm after
No laughter, the content of the rhyme may be contagious

They shot the sucka, sprayed ya, cut ya wife and played her
The player the B-I-G B-O-I, dope boy rhyme maker

It's like the more that I talk to you, the dumber that I get
The closer that I walk to you, the further that we stand
Apart, distant
Nobody has the upper hand but my body's resistant
So now, throw your phalanges in the ground
I'm still abound, un-believers stay from hell around
I found negative niggas they only keep ya down
Transmitting from Native American burial ground
I carry around, the weight of all worlds on my shoulder pads
I'm post to blast, space invaders up somebody's dad
Serious as Aa-Bb-Cc
If knowledge be the key then buddy roasted on the porch
And wait for ya momma to get off work so she can roast yo' ass

Eightball & MJG
Been ten toes down in this game
Since we were two young playas in a one horse town
Knee high to a muthafuckin grasshopper
Nigga, my lights would have been done got cut off
If my dues weren't paid

It's ah, skinny lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices, I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone, I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

In the middle of doin crime (Ugh)
It never stopped me from writin rhymes
It never stopped me from playin music
God put it in me, I had to use it
It was obvious, I had to give up the streets for the beats
Not knowin, but havin faith on just how long that it would be
Before I made it
Before somebody picked up my tape and played it
With a remark like
""Hey, played that instrumental, you cat's got potential.""
In the process of doing talent shows, parties, and mix tapes
We even put it down on some of our homeboys jail release dates
I can remember in the past closin down at fast foods
Strictly stickin to my dreams, but feelin like I'd be the last dude
Who can make it in this rap?
I thought that they ain't gon' see me in Memphis
It was like a time they looked over Tennesseee
And didn't know Hip-Hop was in us
To all my vets in the game, I got love, stay on your toes
Cause back in the days
I use to use your 4-5 instrumental to do my shows
And look, I was 17, when I signed my first contract
And about 18 1/2 when I signed my worst contract
We hurt from that
And til this day, they still distributin our first tape
Before Comin Out Hard, now can you feel it?
Be humble and patient with whatever you should choose
Cause, to get to where I am right now, I done paid my dues

It's ah, skinny lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices, I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone, I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid

A C-note for a concert, I know that sounds preposterous
Nigga, we didn't have a pot to piss
So we got on stage and we rocked the bitch
Fuck the cheese, I love to see my niggas in the front row
Get buck wild, start a fight, the police make a nigga stop the show
Niggas all in the parkin lot, bustin shots, fuckin with hoes
Box chevy with the spokes and vogues
Niggas didn't know shit about a 20 inch Mo-Mo
Hard head, young nigga don't believe that shit, til I see that shit
See them heavyweight niggas, one day, I'm gonna be that shit
Ok, everybody know everybody done sold dope, ran with a gang
Pimp some hoes, and snorted a little coke but uhh
I'm space age-ing.and we'll forever be
Eightball, the fat mack, and M-J fuckin G
Turn the page, from then to now, and we still grindin
Small clubs and small towns, if they bouncin we find them
Put them on the guest list
Make them pump their fist and get buck to this
Make one of them weed smokin, gangsta bitches
Get fucked to this
Expand, give all my true fans what they demand
Do my part again and uhh...come out hard again and uhh..
Keep space agin, and we'll forever be...
Eightball, the fat mack, and M-J fuckin G

It's ah, skinny lines between wrong and right
Trapped in a trap til the mornin light
Ghetto ain't left me no choices, I had to fight
My momma and daddy was too young to raise me right
Maybe I been made a man from all the mistakes I made
Niggas dead, niggas gone, I still ain't afraid
Ain't too grown to get back on with ghetto games I played
My life would have been done got cut off if the dues weren't paid",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-paid-dues-lyrics
Don’t Flex,In Our Lifetime,1999,"Space Age
Chorus 2X:
Dont flex baby
I wanna see you toucha toes in that dress baby
Bounce it up and down like we having sex baby
Give me the head and you can give them tricks the rest baby
And nuthin less baby
(Eightball)
Eightball let me grip the mic and rip the track
Freaky hoes let me see you shaking what you got
Trick niggas buy them hoes a drank to keep em cool
And I'm gone be with them niggas drinking yak ackin a fool
Fulla hay fuck security cuz we dont give a fuck
At the bar drinking shots looking at them hoes strut
Up and down side to side for a nigga like a foe
Young hoes at the club ready to pack they shit and go
Dont trip baby
After the club you can jump off in my whip baby
And let a nigga get a sample of them lips baby
And we gone keep it on the hush
You can hit me on the hip but dont be blowin a nigga up
9 11 all the time damn tell me what you need
Hold on let me click over MJ what you see
(MJG)
I see a stout thang
Were bout to leave a hump off in yo couch mayn
One look at this bitcha make yo mouth hang open
Freak what you looking at
A true pimp I seen it in her camp
Full time party lifer dance floora
Dopeman's bitch average club goer
Shake it baby til your G-strang break loose
I'm watchin now gone make them hoes hate you
She's a cover girl under bed cover fuck yo red brother
And yo black brother and yo dead brother she ain't scared brother
Big thick juicy body molaty
Got mo butt than she got body
She's a go-getter pro switch hitter
But only in the dark
So parking lot competition is hard
I ain't chasing
And if I stay around ain't cause I'm waiting (Uhn)
Now get along girl get bout your straighten
Chorus 2X
(Eightball)
We make it hot
We came to make it hotta than Nevada
Big balling G slanging Suave House product
In the lab like a chemist cooking weighing up and cutting
Trinity to the MPC making dope pushing buttons
Organized Noise
Them country ATL boys
Got it locked up and sewed up and keep it rocked up
Glocked up
Doing the southside like Lil Key Key
Tricks talking shit gone see my hollow tips in 3D
But we didn't come to see no jealous ass niggas
We came to keep the party hype and drank up all the liquor
And fuck with the gold diggers them free drink sippers
Cause them gone be the ones in the room pulling zippers
With they teeth mind blow by the presidential suite
Waking up talking bout they wanna go and eat
Hit the dho baby
You ain't got to go home but yo ass got to go baby
And that for sho baby
Chorus 2X
(MJG)
I saw yo naked ass
Peekin out the curtain of yo mini shirt
Shadow of yo pussy close behind
Telling me MJG
Run with me through fields of flowers
We can fuck for hours
Come and she you anytime
You say no
How you gone say that when you dress say yes
A saddle on yo chest I expect nothing less
Than nuts on yo neck dick on yo chin
Just like we done then last time lets do it again
It looks as if to me you got some handles bout yourself
But everything you struggle to reach is up on the shelf
In homes of pimps who done done it
Some play around with your mind we run it
Gin sippers Orange Mound, Tennessee nigga
We deliver all up and down the Mississippi river
Fuck a check bitch
No ID no income and dividends
Ain't got nothing but space now fill it in

Nobody But Me,In Our Lifetime,1999,"It ain't no changing me, no matter what you claim to see
I can only aim to be, M-J-G
If thangs seem strange to me, they can't be the same with me
You know it's lame to be, somethin that you know is a lie
Hoes want a nigga to try to be somethin that he ain't
Right before your eyes, livin his life in a fuckin disguise
Follow the pack, and wind up dead last (Go on)
Real dummy with your scared ass
In the future, ain't nobody gonna listen to you
(Why) Cause you do whatever to please the crew
It's easy to kiss ass for your wealth or get cash for yourself
I think I'll go with the green, cause asses I do not clean
As bad as the shit might seem, I got a get-right team
Nigga, sensing myself and I, it ain't ever let a day go by
Without reality checks, fuck my salary check
That ain't the reason why I want respect
But you ain't finna distress
I gotta keep a level head, fuck what a devil said
I'm stayin me, M-J fuckin G, put your trust in me

I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me

100 ways to die, and I done survived 99
99 lives lost and one of them could've been mine
Blind with my eyes open, seein what is killin me
Feelin what is killin me, but wantin more constantly
Runnin from temptation, but I'm much to slow to get away
Gang, shootin niggas and bitches fuckin with me everyday
Man if I was lame and couldn't see em from a mile away
Smile on their mug, and in their minds, nothin but jealousy
Why should I get caught up in that bullshit not concernin me
Yeah, I run with Suave and we gone ride til infinity
Lord if I was lyin, strike me right here as I'm speakin this
Separate the strong from the cowardly and the weak at this

I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me

I see him everyday, point shaven and craven
For the money that I be savin, and the moves that I be makin
Breakin rules, tryin not to be one of them broke fools
Robbin niggas comin from school, thinkin that that shit is cool
Served out, whether sober, playboy, I got heataz for ya
Quick to shoot, because that indo boosts up my paranoia
I rap the blues, cause the blues is what I'm livin nigga
Surrounded my animals, living and dying by the trigger
Word to me, and if that shit don't meet your expectations
Fuck you critics, I do this for the underground nation
Slab riders, nigga, drug traffickers and jackers
Heat packers, nigga, all my homeboys ain't rappers
And, I wouldn't say it if it wasn't necessary
All of this is just a test, tryin to prepare me
My future's lookin dark, and I don't think it's gettin brighter
Forever Eightball, Pimp-Caso, Poetry writer...

It's hard to be, something that you didn't start to be
These streets be apart of me, until it's hard to see
Till the years when it's hard to walk, gettin old
And, it's hard to talk, I'm on a line of chalk
It seems thinner than a line of thread, but through all this
Still instead, I'm real after all
Paper, short or tall, wife be big and small
And still down to earth, I'll still be on the scene
Life like a tv screen, but I keep my strength
And I'll keep my hope (Why?)
'Cause I know they got me under the scope
But, if you're lookin at me, Look close, and your ass will learn
Maybe when you have your turn, and take a stand and shit
You might be a man and shit, make your own plan and shit
Cause I don't make no moves unless G wanna make that move
Fuck he and she wanna make that move, I got a face that blues
When a nigga gotta pay them dues, and they lookin at my face like Oooh, mayne, you broke and shit
But they ain't gonna throw me out a rope and shit
I'm a drown and choke and shit
And my focus get cloudy with that hocus pocus shit
I'll be the brokest trick...
But, I'm gone be myself, pimp type nigga for sho'
Once again like I did it before, up top or below
I'm a keep my feet on the floor, and do it in the heat or the snow
Give me a beat and I go off like a champ on your ass
Drop the mic and vamp on your ass, stick a stamp on your ass
Send you off to camp on your ass
When I rain, I'll dampen your path

I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me
I can't be nobody but me, and that's all I can be
I can't be who you want me to be, cause nigga, that ain't me",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-nobody-but-me-lyrics
Love Hurts,In Our Lifetime,1999,"Ain't it funny the things we do to get paid?
The shit we do to show niggas that we ain't afraid
Yeah, I got my education on the streets
Doin dirt left a nigga with some muddy feet
Everyday life brings everyday drama
Smokin weed only makes a nigga mind wander
So much I could've done, but I didn't do
A lot of shit a nigga never should've went through
Trustin another soul with my fate
Showed me how easily love can turn to pure hate
The road, I know, I came to a fork in it
Good or bad, I'm a still be the nigga winnin, NOW
But tomorrow ain't guaranteed
Maybe I can see the future through my young seeds
Plant it, and hope the planet don't damage them
It's a thin line, but I'ma get mine

Who can you trust? God only knows
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money, that's all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust? God only knows
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money, that's all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more

So much pain, drownin my brain, I need a paper towel
Wrap it 'round, soak up the strain, I feel safer now
Lookin' down the road I've travelled-it's been a bumpy one
The walls that I stood on was Humpty Dumpty ones
I feel like one of them pieces up in a chess game
On the line, defending yours from mine
I'm makin moves, attached to strings you can't see
If the move seems a little bit awkward, it ain't me
Now fony people ride your nuts for dolla signs
I bet you drop some cash on the ground, they'd holla ""MINE!""
You far behind, man I'm way too ahead, I might be gone
Think you had some killers ridin with you, you're home alone
I'm in the zone, meaning space age pimpin, new millenium
Holes down deep in the wall, I can't get into them
I'm friend to them, real ass niggas and family members
What you say, nigga I owe you something? I don't remember

Who can you trust? God only knows
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money, that's all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust? God only knows
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money, that's all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more

The root of all evil they say
But yet, there's so much evil in all our roots
Born in a world of iniquity, some knowing, some not knowing.  Even so, we've accomplished so much
But still we have so far to go.  C'mon man
We're born hustlers, and together we'll be greater later
Used to die for, freedom, respect
Now we're dying for dope, hoes, and paper

I'm guilty of all that shit and more
Questioning life, asking what am I here for?
To some, that might seem strange but you dig this
Don't get your feelings hurt, personal and business
Make 'em average to acheive pimp trick status
Lame niggas with no nuts end up embarrassed
Compromise and commercialize, in the eyes of your niggas
Selling out to get the prize
At the same time, my baby cries
I'm on a cell phone in another state doing sound checks
Tryin to make my little niggas' lives a little better
Than a bulletproof sweater, nigga love hurts

I've been a vet-er-an, in this game
I ain't trying to be better than
Only as equal, as the better man
You can only imagine the ghetto if you ain't raised in it
That's where I'm from, childhood glory days in it
I wade in it, what? The waters
Take me on down the stream, I'm going farther
It's still from coast to coast, shore to shore
I stand accused of being a pimp, from root to floor
Doin' work constantly, thinkin' bout your family
As soon as you think it's time to chill
God damn it be, time for another project, another dealine
Man, we're at the end of this rhyme, and I done said mine

Who can you trust? God only knows
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money, that's all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more
Who can you trust? God only knows
It's hard to say who you can call friend or foe
Money, that's all a nigga will die for
So much pain and everybody wants more

We Started This,In Our Lifetime,1999,"We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!

Riding down the strip on a trip in my 'Ham sammich
Started this shit and I'm gon' finish yes I am dammit
We gonna slam it down like to hit it. Shit it is...
Time for them niggas in Memphis, Tenn to get deep within
How deep? shit the devil stay right down the street
And why you mad? the rebels tied a brother by his feet
For what, for what I don't know they tied him to a pickup truck
Then posted up in town like they didn't really give a fuck
I get rid of bigots with bad racial equalities
Bust back at KKK's who try to follow me
These hollow T's saving my ass in crucial situations
Any other tactics I need, I use imagination
A ten steps ahead of your ass type of nigga
Shit that I already know you try to figure
Give up, put your ship up, don't try to sail
Don't you see we got this shit built up, can't pry a nail
In my foundation my sound making too many bump all out the trunk
Get'em crunk blow blunts and buck jump
Ain't no luck chump we come intentional with this dope shit
Using a pen or a pencil back when I wrote this
Space age, feel it perculatin' but all this hurt and hatin'
Still keep on bringing people back to old situations
I change the stations but they playing the same list
We started the shit and we gon' finish the shit

We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!

Mental battle scars polluting my cranium
Watered down fake niggas I'm draining 'em and training 'em
Claiming them Suave House niggas to the dirt bitch
Cross the family and you gon' find yourself gettin hurt, bitch
Peace is all in a nigga mind it ain't reality
Fuck reconciliation, niggas don't want no unity
Born dyin every minute death is closer to me
Its like I'm in a movie, except I'm feeling everything
Pain when another motherfucker try to touch me
Anger when a petty player faker try to fuck me
8-B-A-double L, fat M-A-C
Nice with a mic and I don't think you wanna fuck with me
Love head doctors and I don't mean a psyciatrist
Bitches with that lip grip tighter than a gorilla fist
Pimp shit, when is everybody gonna learn
Pimps and gangstas make the universe turn
Poverty with the right amount of hustle turns to riches
But wrong situations turn hard niggas to bitches
I was born in the war zone fought for everything I got
Learned about my hustle, nigga worked and made the shit hot
Hoes started jockin niggas, boppin like they bitches too
Other niggas mad cause they only sold a tape or two
Fuck what you heard nigga fuck who you be
Suave got the hookup cause suave got the cheese nigga

We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!
We started the shit, and we gon' finish the shit!

Armed Robbery ’99,In Our Lifetime,1999,"Yeah i'ma be real wit you motherfuckas
It done been once and it can be done again
Your family now, welcome to the Suave house

Well I was broke down and out sitting at the house
Two blunts see wit the third blunt hanging out my mouth
Thinking bout how these no clout niggas feel they got cash
And guess a nigga want smooth
Get they ass, but pass me the mass and the mag (uh huh)
If I don't act bad like P jab you niggas should be glad
He had plush pads from coast to coast
Happy capping ass nigga who love to boast
So I post at the strip club, the trick site
Cause I know that's where he spend most of his nights
I'm right outside, when this fool gonna leave the spot
4:30 in da morning we headed out the parking lot
Trailed him up the block made a left at the stop sign
Lame ass nigga rolling solo in a 9-9
At the red light I pulls up on the right
Put two up in his heart he's another armed robbery

Let's get this money run in the crib cock your hammer
Nigga move then you pop your hammer
Shit is real, you react you get killed
Playboy this the deal
I want the dough, the bricks the keys to your whips
A nigga act fly you pop him in his thigh
Let him know that he can die nigga eye for eye
Where the stash nigga, Where your cash nigga
Suave house cut you from neck to ass nigga
Pulling out your heat but you scared to blast nigga
Fucking around wit me you be under grass nigga
Family, friends a thing of the past nigga
Defintely ain't the first and won't be the last nigga
Grab the bag put the duffle over the shoulder
Ran down the steps hopped into the rover
Hi speed chase fuck it take the shoulder
Suave house real niggas ain't pulling over
WHAT

I met this nigga in the streets talking plenty lip (lip)
Saying niggas who rap wit da Suave house they ain't shit (shit)
Never knew that was my fam, god damn he never knew
So I played the game strutting my ass had his brain blew (yo)
Never knew he was fucking wit a bitch from the streets (yo)
Never knew cause the thoughts of pussy had his brain weak (uh huh)
Never knew when he stopped for some rubbers at the store
Never knew bo was coming out busting the fo fo (pow)
Shot him three times in the chest
Let him stinking in the lex
Took his jewerly, took his money, took his car , took his neck
I spit in his face you gets nothing wit me (nothing)
Somebody should have told you about fucking wit me
Lil daddy you thought you was getting some pussy quick huh
You just got fucked by the Suave house bitch
Lil daddy you thought you was getting some pussy quick huh
You just got fucked by the Suave house bitch (bitch)

Now I've be peeping at this motherfucka nigga for two weeks
He got two rocks and two keys, I got two Glocks and two sheets
I'ma try my best to catch this nigga ass when he sleep
It's just me, bo in here smoking keel in the jeep
We just seen him in the club popping cris with some scrubs
Copped two bricks today from cous so we gonna have to git up
So I kicked the door in he had a hoe in fuck position
Must be knowing about me cause wasn't no type resistence
Told the bitch to shut the fuck up
Handcuffed her, boy must have wanted to fuck her cause he pulled out a rubber
I said no time for that smacked her wit the gat now we back on track
Git the G stack keep pack be quick or be splat
Start acting like retarded I'ma show you just how we act
Gonna do him just like TP just to make sure he don't be back
Cause these niggas from the galloroe known for leaving lame hoes
Riding deep in cruiseing boats flipping foes and pimping hoes

Once again a success
Smooth armed robbery
Thorough the first tenet
Gillie Da Kid
Toni Hickman aka Slim goody
Big Duke the Georgia kingpin
Suave House Federation growing stronger and stronger baby

Daylight,In Our Lifetime,1999,"Yeah, uhh uhh uhh, yeah
Space Age forever, knawhatimsayin?
Space Age forever, Space Age baby, yeah

The name of the game is get no sleep
Mash on niggas and always roll deep
Non stop hustle means all profits double
Young nigga tryin to see rocks like Barney Rubble
Vampire, circulate when the moon rise
Do dirt when most people got closed eyes
Rollin, livin off garbage and scraps
Niggas wouldn't even fuck with me if I didn't rap
Thinkin 'bout that man thats just another trap
Another nigga dead from another niggas strap
Space Age in every thought and everything I write
Livin for today, a nigga might die tonight
Just because a nigga think I'm a celebrity
They want to rob and jack and try to bury me
Forced entry embedded in my memory
Fightin sleep like Freddie Kruger tryin to get me
In the midst I wanna see it not hear about it
If a nigga wanna see it gotta be up out it
Can't do without it sayin 'til my life end
Everynight they like ""catch me up again""
Chorus:
You say like daylight, its gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
Some people like gettin up when I'm just gettin in
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again

I look up, I can't see the forest for the trees
Destined to make it through, regardless of the seeds
Of evil that been planted sproutin concrete walls
So everybody have sex 'til its after all
You playin wrong, now you havin to climb so you can make it
Got the whole road blocked and too thick for you to brake it
Don't fake it, you know its ??? hard for you to shake it
The camels tellin you to come on, you had to cake it
Mr. Mistake it, Mr. Do Nothing, uncle give me something
You mouth tellin me love, but I ain't feelin none
Stealin some, same positions I've been facin for years
Now I'm about to put some steak in this meal
Inflatin my bills, excusin you ho's who want fame
Using you ho's for one thang, fuck how you changed bitch
Its funny why you stayed around
And patience how you laid me down
Now you exspectin the crown
I'm full time, respectin the game
Checkin out the girls in change
A turd in the hand is far worst than a turd in a commode
Let that shit float on, cause that shit get old
Chorus:
It seems that daylight is gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me, gonna catch me up again
Some people like gettin up when I'm just gettin in
Gonna catch me, gonna catch me up again
Well well...

Do It How It Go,In Our Lifetime,1999,"Drop It

Ahhhhhhhhhh
On the mother fuckin' one
Hey mane, You know what mane
Nigga walk up to me mane
You know what he did mane
You know asking me about how I keep mother fucking game so tight
Shit mane you know he wanna' know how he get his
Doin' they little game on the side and shit
I told him I don't know why ya'll be doin' that shit man
Keep that shit rolling like for so long and on, longevity and shit man you know
Nigga I told him ya'll gotta know how to do it mane
You gotta do that shit how it go nigga

I'm just a Tennessee nigga straight from Orange Mound
Gangster walking, trying to stack my cheese and put it down
The world ain't ready for the drama that we bringing
The shit that we be saying, cause they don't know the meaning
I was lost mane and ain't nobody found me yet
I'm royalty but them bitches ain't crowned me yet
I told 'em once hard times ain't no hurting from me
I'm 8Ball nigga now look out for MJG

Up in your shit mane thinking about sticking the flag in
Phony ass tricks be flossing and braggin'
'Bout bitches they done fucked and places they have been
You get it cause they know when you hit it you cash in
Nigga don't be telling me you that you staying above the bitch
When all the time dumb and you secretly love the bitch
Them drugs and shit
That must affected ya'll strongly
I got one woman and don't no bitch own me

Boys want to be men but act like ho's
Ho's want a nigga tricking off his dough
Pimps and gangsters do whatever for the dough
Tricks and busters do whatever for a ho
Lame niggas slip cause they game too slow
If you not hustling for some paper what you husting fo'
Don't trip cause a nigga like me don't fold
Get it how you live nigga
Do it how it go

Big shot nigga boss on my own commission
Space age pimpin' take you to another dimension
Fast living on the Audubon headed for death
A nigga ain't gon' have shit if I don't get it myself
Stone face to a nigga think he know about me
I'm the fat one the skinny nigga MJG
Flipping with Charlie Hustle when I'm in Northern Cali'
B-legit, got that sticky green, choke a nigga salad
Split one, roll it up, spark it up
Hold it for a second, then bark it up
8Ball known to rock a nigga world slanging verses
Leaving nigga's and they bitches face down riding hearses
No mercy how it come to me and that's how I be giving it
Hard is how I'm living bitch and that's why I be writing it
Rob a mother fucker, mass murder, dope slangin'
Straight pimp gaming, keeping ho's entertainin'

Boys want to be men but act like ho's
But then ho's want to be men and wear boys clothes
We cream of the crop
Certified finest ones
When did we drop
Nineteen Ninety-one
And what did we see
We saw ourselves doing this shit
And what did we know
Niggas going try to ruin this shit
I'm riding with God
Protected by an untouchable squad
You rushing me hard
I'm bout to pull this buzz in your yard
And make a command and dance all over your grass
Suave House nigga's ran all over your ass
You broke and you mad
Found out your wife a ho and you sad
Crying and shit, like a bitch give him a rag
Not for his eyes, he need them for his panties and shit
Faggot sitting down to piss, instead of standing and shit
Trip I'm a pimp type nig-a-roll
Slash gigolo
Ask me how I do it
How you do it
How it go, nigga

Boys want to be men but act like ho's
Ho's want a nigga tricking off his dough
Pimps and gangsters do whatever for the dough
Tricks and busters do whatever for a ho
Lame niggas slip cause they game too slow
If you not hustling for some paper what you husting fo'
Don't trip cause a nigga like me don't fold

Forever,Living Legends,2004,"Ooh la la bangladesh..
Heyyy...

See a nigga like me gonna get money til I get rich
Ride with a couple hundred G's in a biscuit
Stay down for whatever forever hustle wit my misfit holmes
And soon you gonna see just how crunk this shit be once we get rich
Til then its back to hustlin with my misfits
Deep, on a creep, fifty zones tucked under the brougham..
Fifty zones tucked under the brougham

I keep a big old nigga beater heater
Its in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
Im make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my ho but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowlege as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the MJG, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick
Come on, where my money, let me hit the stage
Fuck them long interviews, just give us the front page
Black G apostrophe S us, forever bust
Them lyrics that make the people say that he got nuts


Yeah man..
Sticky weed kickin in, big Ball steppin in
Straight flying when I hustle, thats how I represent
Bounce, if you feelin what I'm spitting up in your ear hole
I been rocking mics since I was 17 years old
Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggas die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on TV
Be myself and dont be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood
Cinderella with my fellas deep off in the hood
Nigga


You need to stop sticking your hand out and trying to fold it
Turn around the broom handle and trying to hold it
It's plenty dirt to be swept, and leaves to be raked
Now you need to leave from my face, take heed to mistake
That you just made, thinking a player could get played
Thinking that a rapper could get wrapped and phone tapped
My whole life I learned the hard way to spot liars
And it seems like its usually the ones thats right by ya
FIRE!

Jumping up out the tip with pistols sittin up
Fuck me? Watch my gun skeet like its bussing nuts
'Cept when it hit your cheek it burn then it split your cheek
Then come out the back of your head, now your just a memory
Graphic how I got it illustrated, rated triple X
Niggas want to be the king, I dont give a fuck who's best
Just watch your mouth, talkin down in the south
I'm gonna let my nuts hang and start punching clowns out",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-forever-lyrics

They broke the mold, one of a kind, fat boy witta gold mouth that shine
Hard to touch, sorry to tell you, boys out here ain't hard as us

Now your life is leavin yo body, for drinkin too much Bacardi
You should've known when you started
Never fuck with G and E

I'm good for rippin' and rhymin' in and out the beat
And 8 Ball is loadin' the clip, for niggas supposin' to trip
And you know I'm rollin' the whip, we finna set 'em free


8 Ball and G, get it crunk fa sho
My swagger, my flavor, my pimpin', my flow
My ho, my woman, my slacks, my denims
My backstroke in swimmin', in pools wit models in 'em
Them boys, they hate it, we hustle, we made it
We richer, the picture, is two of the greatest

The realest, you bump some Ball and G you gon feel it
Guaranteed, muhfucker, stamp, sign, seal it

We placin, the fakest, they don't give it up we gon take it

Kidnap family members, them niggas don't leave no witness
They all love a gangsta, that shit be so addictive
When we pull up, they know who we are by the car
We blowin big, and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar


Take your vest off, I'm blowin your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase, I'll follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin tires out, don't try to ride now
What happend to the bass in your voice, you just cryin now
Thought you was a man, you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin for ya, and boy its time now
To blow the whole shit out the right side of your head man
Ain't no way for retaliation when yous'a dead man
Not a scared man, we keep it, out the frame
We stayin away from lames, and run the whole game
I do it like G, you ain't, fuckin with me

With murder and homicide, and daily, niggas die
And daily, niggas ride, ain't no need to reason why, it’s

Them boys that disrespect, with bullets they get showered

(Ay, Grand Hustle, Bad Boy South, let's ride, nigga)
Chevy super clean, two or three screens
Watch DVDs, to the left I lean
50 karats in the crown, nigga, no more scheme
Just to let you sucker niggas know I'm the king
This green I smoke we call it dro
It's deadly as promethazine
You see my folk, we ain't no joke
Don't turn this into a murder scene
I'm paranoid totin' this .44
Been shootin' out since my early teens
I'ma drop that though, grab a M-16
You can bring all the niggas you want to bring
Hey! I thought you were running things
All you did was run the screens
Must be out his mind thinkin' T.I.P. won't touch 'em
See ya, I'ma rush ya, ""Let it Burn"" like Usher
Click, click, bang, nigga, end the discussion
Ain't shit sweet 'cause I seen you was bluffin'
I still would spray broad day, ain't nothing
And let Mac Boney AK do it for me
I'm immune to the drama, act a fool if you wanna
Lean in my pocket, 40 cal by the stomach
He acting like he want it, I'ma show a nigga somethin'
Somebody finna to have to break the news to his momma
I don't tolerate sucka niggas tryin' me
Take a special kinda nigga to be fly as me
Similar to 8Ball and MJG, been comin' out hard since '93
Niggas know, ain't no outshining me
I've been the G you're trying to be
I mob with gorillas, squaders and robbers and killers
Real niggas gonna ride wit' me

Take a look at my wheels, rolling through the south
Still spinning and I'm still smoking heavy
Look at both of my grills, my motherfucking mouth
Looking just like the rims on the Chevy
Pimp Twist, I'm a playa still, ballin' in the game count major bills
Come and take a trip with me to hater Ville
On some 24 omegas and gator grill
Fuck a twist. fuck you, bitch
I don't really wanna have to bust you, bitch
Roman gold shine so hard
Niggas out here know they can't touch that shit
I don't trip, niggas pull up
I be lookin' proud when I bust that dutch
'Specially when I look at the mac in the black Cadillac
And the bubbles in the Hummer truck
When you see a nigga cruise through
Never try to jack, you gon' lose, 'cause like Cube, I'ma kill at will
And motherfuckers wanna take my style
'Cause niggas out here know I'm only fucking with the bonnet grills
And the haters wanna see me fall
How can I let y'all niggas play me
Shited on their good then I pull up
From my vehicle while bumpin' 8 Ball & MJG
Twista bitch and I from the Chi
With my Memphis connect and I ain't gon' lie
We be specializing in only coming up with dope shit
And pulling up with cold wheels that's fly
Still drink, still blow, then I creep through the hood real slow
Ride when I bump Kamikaze shit while I scream look at my grill, ho

The club close at 5 o'clock, we pulling up around three
Woodgrain wheel gripping, Cinderella sipping
I like my jewelry golden like a piece of fried chicken
Money players keep me gleamin' like I'm Willie Beamen
Like a bitch that practice sucking dick and drinking semen
She scheming, dreaming, wishing she can be my number one
Forever young, mama, I just wanna have some fun

Don't try to ever take my cash from me
You might as well jump off a cliff, you fucking crash dummy
Like that's my last money
This for my niggas who be bussin' back at perpetrators
We don't discriminate, we'll hurt now and hurt you later
But I ain't worried, I'll smoke one of you fucking haters
And now I'm higher than gators on the refrigerator
Down south Memphis Tenn. pimpin', gotta rep it
The dirt I did, under the rug where a nigga swept it

No way you can revoke my vision
I, dont play I make a ho pay a commission
Baby, come on you know I wrote compositions
That make niggas wish they never spoke while they were spittin
I'm so ready I'm bout to blow from the tensions
Like surprise you dont even know what you gettin
I'm becomin quick can't slow my conditions, can't throw my positions, I flow with precision
It's a must a keep it on the low in addition
To all my weapons and mo' ammunition
I'm MJG, and I'm so in attention now
See you tryin to creep me for my dough, why you trippin
You's a shipwrecked nigga when ya boat go a missin'
Jesse Jackson can't help you with the Hope Coalition

Well, I'm spreading the news
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
Its not easy to do
I got the streets in my pocket
And if ya hating better stop it
Straight Cadillac Pimpin'
Young nigga better listen

If I should die, before I wake
Roll me sum up, make sho I'm straight
Make sho my cup filled up with yac
Make sho my paper come in stacks

I come through like a mack, truck rumbling streets
Big Boy hit tracks straight crumbling beats
Rock hard like coke in a pot, them fiends
Pay top dollar for the hot product indeed, yeah
Turn it up and get addicted to it
And have raw music soon as you listen to it
Jump up like a old fat lady at church
Jump back like a uncut thang at work
Mang, hop in and take a ride with a pimp nigga
Fire the green up and let me shoot the shit witcha
Talk slick till I make a chick get the picture
Just a page outta fat boy ghetto adventures
Listen, I'm a Titan on the mic
Original, them weak niggas bite what I write
Oh Lord, we going to get it jumpin like revival
Survival, Straight from my street bible



These verses I must rip, dont slip, pimp a bitch
Put on your look, best outfit, get rich

This here, get you out of your seat fo sho
Jump up, get crunk like you got the Holy Ghost

Pay yo collection plate, be straight, dont hate
Four strippers at the gate, no shake no plate

Don't hate, pay ya weight, make a pimp pockets straight
VISA, check, cash, any city, any state

Deep Down, in the country, in the hills, makin deals
No ex-aggeration, it is what it is

Memphis City Blues,Living Legends,2004,"Hmmm...
Said I got the blues
Said I got the blues
Memphis City Blues

Light up the green, watch me light up the room
Watch me light up the mic, fat boy be the truth
Nigga live and learn, learn the streets or get burned
Niggas take what you earn, they be slick as a perm
Mayne, I try to be slicker, try to be cunning and quicker
Try to be more than just another broke ass nigga
In this game of life, lose your life in the game
Take a life full of pain, make you remember my name
From the home of the blues, thought I paid my dues
It's hard to fill my shoes, imitators abuse
I just love the music, like my heart or my brain
Couldn't live without it, that's impossible mayne
I'm unstoppable mayne, from the bottom I came
Niggas scratching for bread, stumbled up on the fame
Humble niggas with game, shut your mouth up and listen
Recognize it's a blessing, thankful just to be living

I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, street oh man, oh man, oh man

I had the Memphis City jones running through my bones
Way, way back with A+ beepers and gray phones
Even further back when I was just playing around the yard
Riding bikes and shit, falling and getting my legs scarred
In the Music City, Memphis, Tenn., they turned me into this
My dad and a couple of my friends they played instruments
And when we used to roll to school at 16
We bumped shit like Bobby Womack and Al Green
Hell, I knew most of the old school shit from front to end
I would start to memorize four-fives at age 10
I come from a city where R&B run deep
And the blues was the music that paved the whole street
It was only natural that we would take the torch and run wit' it
Be serious but still have a little fun wit' it
MJG from a town that runs real deep
Ask B. B. King and Isaac Hayes on Beale Street

I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, street oh man, oh man, oh man

On that pimping man, me and G was born and raised
Commodores, O'Jays, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Windows rolled down, no AC 'cause the gas low
Bread at a minimum but still we found a place to go
North to the South at my nigga house, chiefing out
Skipping school, learning what the Memphis City Blues 'bout
Me and G and a whole bunch of others
Had a rocky road to travel just to make the world love us

'Cause it's The Memphis City, really, to call it itty bitty
Would be an understatement—we got big ass, cash, and titties
Big pimping working and hurt the pockets of big tippers
Side dippers and big jails to hide niggas
But we stayed out 'em
Hard times we prayed 'bout 'em
Nigga step up talking that shit and I laid out him
MJG reppin' the Memphis, Tenny
You and I could feel it, pass me some of the Henny

I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets, oh man, oh man, oh man
I got the Memphis City Blues
Ooh, I could feel it now
The neighborhood pimps introduced us to pimping (This is how they put it down)
And everybody we know
Used to play in them, streets, oh man, oh man, oh man

Baby Girl,Living Legends,2004,"What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me

Let's hit my residence, baby it's evident
That you been raising hell, I make it heaven sent
M-J take you to places that you never went
One room one night for every day spent
Knocking a dent in the sheetrock she's hot
Got them legs fanned open like a peacock
I saw her dancing in the club with her new outfit
Her hair and her nails did show me love
Ya man say he got good green show me some bud
Give me the real hook up price like I'm ya cuz
Baby see I'm above the bullshit and the playing
Them hoes you listening to don't know what they saying
They relaying that he say she say language
If that's the way we trying to swing it won't swang it
M-J fucking G I ain't really new to this shit
Just wanna add something new to the list


Money make the world go round that's what they say
Conversation rules the nation in every way
My mind thinking shit and I say it before I know
I'm at the condo busting condoms on the floor
We keep the crunk hyper than any who use a mic
We do the kinda music the pretty women gone like
A sweet smell you know with perfect nails and toes
A round cinibun head under them clothes
I know you wanna go and smoke out
Stay up all night and go eat at the Waffle House
You and me bring your friend that make three
I bet I can make you feel so sexy
Let the drank flow and burn the best dro
Put ya drank down and go hit the dancefloor
Make a nigga wanna get withcha and spend dough
Love what you do to me mami I wanna know


My yak spilling full of that hay I'm feeling right
Spend the night with me let's wake up and take a flight

She'll suck a nigga dick for the flight but don't bite
We gone keep it on the low no gossip and no hype

My rubber on tight on the jet on the runway
Leave Monday don't come home to Sunday

We dip Tuesday be back in town by Wednesday
Break a girl off that chain like Cunta Kintae

So will you dip with me baby girl
On a trip around the world while I play with your curls

Play with your titty nipples will that make your toes curl
You a bad motherfucker baby its your world

I know I'm coming on strong but that's me
Whatever you want I can do it correctly

So get ya mind right baby you Tina and I'm Ike
Bring that ass over here dance with Ike or we gone fight",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-baby-girl-lyrics
Confessions,Living Legends,2004,"And it's hard
Hard

Yea yea sittin looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin leave they own folks layin in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow
 cuts in
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And the only way is to keep your head on right
Oh yea",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-confessions-lyrics
Trying To Get At You,Living Legends,2004,"Drum Majors, Gorilla Tek, y'all

Bad Boy, baby
Ball and G
(Yeah)
You ready?
(Some of that ghetto love shit)
Come on, let's go

Smash with my niggas, you know how we do
Flippin' through the hood, that's when I bumped into you
At the car wash jumpin' out your E-Class
Petite frame with your little round fat ass
10 1/2 for your eyes and your pretty toes
I wanna know you but I heard you got a nigga though
Anyway, I'ma spit it like I know that you with it
My windows are tinted so he won't know that you in it
We can cruise the city and get the car weed scented
Drink a Hen, open up and let your boy squeeze in it
A G for real I never played those games
Wanna get in your brain, put some ice in your chain
You can stay with your mayne, act a fool and complain
Come and get with your boy, we just hang and bang
That's the business but you don't want a nigga like me
You want a weak ass nigga just pretendin' to be

I wish I would've said somethin'
That would've made you stopped walkin'
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Can I talk to you?)
And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Baby, I'm trying to get to you)

Baby, you need a hard leg, a straight nigga with no sugar
One that won't play no games and give it to you
In the buck, doggystyle, the whole mile
Mix it up, with the new and the old style
Ain't you tired of your man hangin' up at your job
Followin' you 'round, talkin' 'bout you breakin' his heart?
You too pretty, to have a nigga prettier than you
You need a cut-throat nigga, baby, tell you the truth
I'm MJG, and I ain't tryin' to stay in your face
Or crowd your space or try to get a key to your place
I got my own spot, shit, but we gon' hit the hotel-ly
I can't take you to my spot until I know that you're ready
See, I ain't the one to fall in love just in a week
Take out all my money then go invest in a freak
I see something I like, baby, can I just get a number?
Don't worry 'bout the stress and the pressure he got you under

I wish I would've said somethin'
That would've made you stopped walkin'
(Made you stop walkin', girl)
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Girl, I'm trying to get to you)
And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(Baby, I'm trying to get to you)

Look, if your boy calls, tell him that you're rollin' with your girls
Tell him y'all shoppin', you gon' meet him at the crib
Really I'ma have you somewhere diggin' in your ribs
Pullin' off the rubber and shootin' it on your lips
Dream about the day when I can hold your hips
Wanna spoil you and tell niggas you my bitch
See, you got a nigga, I don't wanna see y'all split
The real nigga in me make a nigga do that shit

You're listenin' to your friends again, oh no
Why you wanna take advice from them? They solo
I'm the one that put the spark in your life, all night
And all day, so motherfuck what they all say
Tell 'em MJ said it and MJ done it
Shot straight into your life like Haley's Comet
Eliminated them other cats who wanna run it
Keep the bullshit, we'll take you away from it

I wish I would've said somethin'
That would've made you stopped walkin'
(Made you stop walkin', girl)
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby
(I'm trying to get to you)
And instead of trying to step on you
I let another nigga up on you
How can I let you know, girl
I'm trying to get at you, baby

Fifth of 'yak sippin', sippin'
Don't practice going in the strip clubs tippin'
MJG ah, P.I.M.P. ah
Fuck a blind date, oh no, I got to see her
The new millennium poet
Forever show it, can't blow it
If you reap it, you sow it
I, pay my, dues
And it's the rules that I play by
Carry the team like I'm A.I
I used to cook rocks, and hit the block
And gun in the bushes, and money in my sock
Shit, I had hoes way before I was nationally famous
I was in the hood strapped up good
Watchin' my anus
I'm a target splitter
The world strongest man hardest hitter
Even though you hate
I still elevate regardless nigga
Step to us boy, look what you done started
And we don't even care that your arsenal be the largest

When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone
When it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
When it's on, you better get your shit and be gone

Look, you niggas play too much mayne
You need to pump yo' brakes
Keep a heater nigga need for them restless snakes
Right in my face caught a case tryin' to defend my space
Dodging snitches police niggas jumping state to state
What kind of nigga run his mouth and snitch out everybody?
The kind of nigga that's gone end up being a dead body
Yo' wife and children gone be searching for their dear ol' daddy
They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggas will fuck you like a dirty ho
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor
See you in public fuck who with you let the thang go
A nigga tell you don't let business turn personal
Fuck what they say cause for gram a nigga hurtin' you
Niggas out here hurtin' fool
Nothing is for free mayne
Fuckin' with the game
That's how that shit be mayne


I was torn this bitch came from the streets I was born
Pussy like a little kitty back yellow as corn
I don't go around poppin' shit wit' niggas who talkin'
Them niggas ain't talkin' no more
Closed coffin
Not often do you see a nigga loyal as I
Like that boy from Bed-Stuy nigga ready to die
For my bread and them niggas that considered me family
Hold it down mayne I got you til we up there wit' granny

Cause as soon as I start writing
I start going through physical
Deeper into my spiritual
I'm so fuckin' lyrical
MJG the realest the truth the definition
Just call me the competition
I'm still stomping and pimpin'
I'm still working with Diddy, still fuck wit the hood
I got the key to the city, the streets is all good
My leather is all wood, my gun is still secluded
I'm still hoping and praying to God I don't use it",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-when-its-on-lyrics

What kind of nigga always run his mouth like a hoe
Like his jaw got a battery, this nigga always know
Who got robbed, got shot, who got put on lock
Nobody invited you and still you got up in the spot
Me, I'm not a witness, keep my distance, mind my business
You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it cause they know it's real
Like UGK, ""we keeps it trill"" mobbin' through the field
Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggas know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill
You try to stop it, get yo' shit broke up in twenty pieces
We roll deep in brand new vehicles wit secret features
Game preachers move yo' pimpin' for you mamasitas
We players on the field, y'all niggas in them bleachers

You talkin' down behind my back (uh) you done shot off nigga
Fifty, four or twenty sack, you done shot off nigga
If you fly and got a gun (uh) when the drama come, you run (uh)
You know what you just done, you done shot off nigga

Man come on now, you done shot off, just like my Daytons lost a knockoff
Or a tight-ass shirt when the button pop off
You standin' in snow and you got yo' shoes and socks off
Who holds the key? No-fuckin-body, I brokes the lock off
I blew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off
I'm gettin' hot and startin' to boil, don't turn the pot off
You disrespectin' pimpin', pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe ya snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' beacuse you not boss
M-J-G, pimp tight, I'm movin' yo' spot off
And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off
And livin' on the edge rebellin' I'm never dropped off
Like Aaron Hall, ""Don't Be Afraid"" bitch, call the cops off

Now you can either check yo' ego at the do' (door) or let the drama unfold
And check my Rap Sheet, BITCH, I'm almost ten million sold
I'm only rappin' cause I want to, I got enough plaques
Needless to say, my favorite rappers told me to get on this track
And so I DID it, quickly wrote my sixteen down and SPIT it
By the end of the verse you'll say, ""once again, Ludacris SHIT it""
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass
I keeps it, ""gangsta, gangsta!"" shooters and shanksters
Until you shot off motherfuckers, I'm a ""thank ya, thank ya!""
Runnin' yo' mouth behind my back until you run out of time
But at least yo' talkin' let's me know some millions stay on yo' mind
It ain't nothin' wrong wit that
Tell em grabbin' the thang and then I put it to yo' brain
And change everything you ever hope fo' (for) wit the .44

I'm not fine I'm not cute, they just know I got some loot
Grippin wood, lookin good '24s make them choose
Nine times out of ten the bitches bad news
Hit the dick and start actin like a motherfuckin' fool
Clothes brand new from my T-shirt to my shoes
Pop a tag every day, that's what ghetto niggas do
Hustle hard, spread all the bread with my crew
When we in the club they be poppin bottles too
We crunk and keep it hype and everybody know it's on
When my work hits the street watch how quick that shit be gone
I rap like I'm quick enough but catch 'em full of zones
When my work hits the street watch how quick that shit be gone, nigga

Spend your bread on rims and ice, whatever them bitches like)

You ain't hard from steroids, nigga you big fraud
I remember when them bullets was takin your lunch card
I'm a real ghetto politician
And what I gotta give in to motherfuckers who willin to try to vision
When a nigga spittin', Quit all the whinin' and bitchin'
Baby sharp, look and listen, pay attention to what you been missin'

We makin plenty bread and we reppin' our hood (Streets is watchin')

What can I say about these streets that I be walkin'?
Not too much cuz where I from niggas ain't motherfuckin talkin
We'd rather listen and watch
Tryin to flex and gaurd their clothes and Baume and Mercier watches
Tryin' to get my gloss on
I paid the cos' to be the boss on these corners where ballin niggas floss on
Haters get tossed on, 5-0 get  and out of towners get robbed
And drop that, can't nobody gonna stop that
See it was like this before me
So if you think it's time to change, nigga show me
Obviously you don't know me It's time that you learned
Niggas that try to hold me on my grind, they get burned

Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down

It's Sunday morning, I'm stil yawnin from the night before
So much sess in my chest from the Swishers I smoke
OH NO!!!! Who is this ho in the bed with me?
I remember the pussy but I don't remember her name G
Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that ho
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that ho come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor
I'm a killa on them sticks, aggravated hallucinatin
Tryin to let go of my frustration
But some unlucky nigga gonna be a med patient
I gotta nine uzi AK, but that shit don't really matter
Cause if I gotta I will rat-a-tat-a
To splatter the guts of nigga with no nuts
And if you step to Suave you will have to lay it down

Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down

Here comes the one that says fire up the fry
And get high, and get a head rush
The number one gangsta you can't touch or bust
So steppin is the wrong that you gots to come against me
You best to do a driveby and be prayin that you hit me
Cause nigga if you miss me I'mma have to draw my gat
And take yo ass way back, cause way back way back in the days
I used to beat dope fiends down just get paid
Live my life as a hustler, sellin drugs was my only J
My moms was a trick ho I had nowhere to stay
And nigga that's fucked all my homies are loners
I've been homeless for ten years so I'm known on corners
With bitches and prostitutes, pimps and killa thugs
Five-oh harrassin me, so Crime Boss is peelin slugs
A good guy gone bad, devious fuckin kid
Victim of Sunny Side from shit that my momma did
These dope beats comin up, I'm servin those clucker bitches
My beeper still goin off, I'm thinkin of addin riches
Fuck dollars and sense, see I gotta have it goin on
Been trapped in this hole for too motherfuckin long
It's on! It's on!

Thirty busters in yard talkin shit bout a bitch
Claimin to be that bitch's family but they look like thirty tricks
Talkin about why did I meet that ho, fuck the ho
Charge the ho, break the ho, house the ho
Busta that's how this pimpin' go
Suckers how the fuck you think that MJG was gonna slip
Only reason you mad cause you sister couldn't pussy whip
A back breakin, check takin, pimp nigga constantly makin
Money off your sister and your lady, nigga I ain't tradin
Why don't you niggas understand I'm the pimp she's the ho
Now that I told you now you know, break that chain and let her go
Back on the track shake that ass, make my money
Make it fast, get yo head swole bringin me checks
Bitch bring me cash, drop yo panties, to let you start
To open your mouth, slurp and slob
On this dick you, he's the trick you's a bitch, do ya job
When you through, get up and go, get the cheese, hit the door
Catch a cab, back to the lab, bring my motherfuckin money ho
Don't you ever front me with a lame lie about my bank
Oh shit, look out bitch, duck a fist, catch a plank
Yeah ho now you know, I'm a pimp
And I'mma clown all upside yo headeah bitch, I'mma lay it down",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-lay-it-down-lyrics
Break-A-Bitch College,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"Good morning, class
This is your teacher, MJG
Look at me as I write my name on the board
Class, do you see my name?
Do you understand my name?
Well, listen
Okay
Class, today at Break-A-Bitch University
We will teach young bustas, playa-hatas
And all of these weak, narrow-minded young sissies
How to break a bitch
Now
Really, it's so easy
Mister G, I have a question
Yes?
Pimpology today is different than it was in the 70s
Aha
I wanna know how can anybody stroll today
And if so, what proceeds do we have to go through?
Well, check it out
First here's what you have to do
{​MJG:}​
It's time to let the p-i-m-p in the fuckin front do'
One mo' nigga cuttin paper on the down low
It's so twisted in this white man's society
Why it be hard for a nigga when he try to be
Independent, on his own with a plan
You hate it cause you can't understand how I can
Rearrange and change how your daughter was raised
And teach her how to constantly get paid when she's laid
Ain't no use in bein the freak of the city, you still ain't got no ducats
You want a rolex or ride buckets?
Bitch, listen cause you gots plenty of competition from these other hoes
Who think that you supposed
To fall dead, short, lame to the game
Don't worry, put them bitches in your pistol range
MJ fuckin G settin your mind free with the type of knowledge
Class has started, day number one in Break-A-Bitch College
And today, class
We have a guest speaker, Mister Fat Mac
Please introduce yourself...
Good evening, players, good evening
Eightball the Fat Mac here
I'm here to let you know
That these bitches, mean these bustas no good
You see what I'm sayin?
Now first of all, class
Are there any questions?
Ah yes, Mister Eightball
You bein a Professor of Pimpology
Tell me how these niggas let these hoes
Get em caught up in that fuck shit
Alright buddy, check this out...
{​Eightball:}​
Once again here I come pushin that funk into your ear
Do you recall Eightball, the player of the year
Calm cause I'm cool, and I'm cool cause I'm calm
Leavin hoes shell-shocked like they fall in Vietnam
Mayn, some have game, but most of them can't handle this
Those that I think are stars, end up bein scandalous
Welfare recipients, crib full of rugrats
Boost a couple of shirts, and now the bitch think she all that
Freakazoids have a nigga noid steppin up to me
Hoes that'll fuck you fast might be packin H.I.V
Me, I'm packin jimmy hats
So a hoe won't give me that
Shit about she on the pill
Knowin that her pussy kill
See, through my education illustrations were the key
See, where I'm from only bustas have to pay a fee
Now you might ask what can a nigga do to get started
Pull a hoe and go enroll in Break-A-Bitch College
Ah yeah
Now that was a very nice lecture
And as I walk back over to the middle of the bulletin board
I - I kinda figured, I wondered to myself
And I looked at my class, and I
It seems that you have more questions
Is there any more questions?
Yes
Yes, Mister MJG
I have a question
Yes?
Ah - in 94
Do you think - ah
Any bitches are gonna come up?
Can - can any bitches be pimps?
Look here, look here
Let me tell you...
{​MJG:}​
Now these bitches got a lotta game for a nigga, so
That made me try to see how to break a hoe
What exactly would it take for me to make the bitch click
How damn quick could I make the bitch break a trick
How fuckin long will it take to make my profit
And what kinda justice can this hoe do for my pocket
Talkin space-age pimpin, similar to the oldies
In ways like keepin our business tight, not by tryina be Goldie
These niggas gettin they game picked down to the bone
If you listen on what these hoes have to say, your money's gone
Nigga, focus on your own grind, make em follow your own rules
Don't be a fool, nigga, bring that bitch on by to school
I got a class for that ass, and it stars at seven
'I was a pimp' at ten o'clock, break till eleven
Future looks good for the smartest
Niggas in the school of Sir Break-A-Bitch College
Okay class, okay class
Everybody just needs to settle down
Everybody just settle down
We're gonna break in about 15 minutes
But we have one more lecture, one more lecture
Now ehm, eh
Calm down, calm down
I'm gonna take one more question
I'm gonna take -
Are there any more questions?
Ah yeah - ah
I wanna know
How can a ordinary busta like me
You know, you know
...get in Break-A-Bitch College?
{​Eightball:}​
Not long ago I grew up as a youngster in this shit
When all I wanted to do is stick my dick up in a bitch
That dope made my ends, and my ends bought me weed
And all I wanted to see was them young bitches on they knees
Uncle Sam, damn, can I get a job, see
I don't wanna sell this dope, and nope, I don't wanna get out and rob
Today I was coolin like I usually do
I met this hoe after a show that wanted to chew me and screw
Now some busta-ass nigga woulda fucked the bitch
But at Break-A-Bitch College that's called trickin off your dick
On the corner ain't no pimps, real players are low-key
I'm on the verge of a splurge, settin up shop in Tennessee
Ain't no future for the lame, ain't no love in this game
Do you fuck them hoes and trust them hoes and love em with no shame?
9 times out of 10, trick nigga, if you do
Break-A-Bitch College got a scholarship just for you
Ah yes
Damn good class, damn good class
Wonderful graduates
I love em all, I love em all
Now class
Can you all join in with me
For our school alma mater
And let's sing it
I'm proud to be an alumni
From Break-A-College
I'm proud to be...",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-break-a-bitch-college-lyrics
On the Outside Lookin’ In,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"The hammer hit the table leaving me with 7 years
My history was shit so I could'nt shed a tear
My future was a wall, surrounded by a cage
Them laws got me locked down damn at an early age
The only thing I got is a lust for the streets, the shit I gotta learn
And the shit I gotta teach
I'm living for the minute, muthafuck a whole hour
And I ain't pickin shit up when It falls in the shower
My lady sends me pictures with her pussy in the air
But she ain't really there
So I don't really care
The only thing I got is a muthafuckin dinner
So fuck what I had, cuz where I'm at I'm a beginner
I gots to be a winner in this muthafuckin mix up
Get my shit together, scope it out and try to fix up
Some confidence to keep a real nigga going strong
The system is my house, the system is my home
The system was designed to keep a brotha on his back
The system crackers caught me that's exactly where I'm at
My lawyer was a snitch, got me framed started buggin
My muthafuckin phone and the judge was his cousin
It's hard thinkin positive with negative around me
So I had to relate to the grounds that surrounded thee
House and The Mound where I chill
With the niggas who respected a real nigga
Cuz MJG respect them too
So I had to survive living my life with the street rule ""stay cool""
Disregard school and make my money fool, check it
It's hard to understand where I'm comin from if you on the outside talkin shit
Lookin in, then again if you was on the inside lookin out, 9 times outta 10
You would probably be my friend
Nigga how you figure, the system's gonna help ya
The ghetto's where they put ya, the ghetto's where they kept ya
See deep down in my heart I had this urge to go astray
And knock out all my problems in one ordinary day
The system got me thinkin cuz I'm locked down in a tank
They saw a brotha strokin, so they had to make his ship sank
So I can't get mixed up with them devils or no other
With Ani.....mosity I hate when It's a brother, none other
Than a buck, duck, hoodle up, shootin up thangs in the wind
I'm in the Pen, you outside lookin in",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-on-the-outside-lookin-in-lyrics
Playerz Night Out,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"(music plays in back)

O-OH-O-O-OH-O-OH It's the playerz night
O-OH-O-O-OH-O-OH it's the players night

I'm just loungin, coolin, maxin in the studio
Drankin on the yak, smokin fat mac indo
Five-o, droptop, watermelon flip flop
Put her to the floor and watch how fast that ass drop
Oh my god the sun is out I feel like ridin G, (MJG- meet me up at
Pressure world)
Alright nigga(MJG-Peace Nigga)
Pull up at pressure world blowin on the fat one
I'm cool with everyone but still pack a fat gun
I gotta meet my nigga MJG ya know
He said he got the hook up with a couple of west Memphis hoes

Two hoes takin off they clothes
Given up they mouth to the pimps of the house
Got seveteen dollars in my tank and I think if the hoes wanna have
Dranks
But we ain't cuzz we can't waste time on a hotcap
Shit like ridin with a bitch all in my lap
I got pimp shit planned for the nine-fo
How the fuck you figure I coming through the front door
Roll me spliff with the tip up to my mouth
Fire dat bitch up cuzz its players night out


Yeah you know where I'm headin fool
Straight to the nigga with the herbs I gotta smoke a spliff
So I can calm my nerves
Full of yak
But a nigga ain't drunk yet
Waitin on a beep from this ho I just met
She's a star so I gotta get her put the mack down tight
So I know I'm gonna hit her
Split her, then get up and leave the ho bitter
Cuzz I play her like myself does not want to get her
Its still kinda early and I'm losing my buzz
Stop by the crib smoke a spliff in the hot tub
MJG is in the den gettin chwed on
That nigga must be drunk he still got his shoes on
I gotta broad in the kitchen cookin steaks
I'm puttin on my clothes and I'm bout to hit the highway
I got to get out this muthafuckin house so I can splurge
On this playerz night out


Ahhh Shit
Just got hit with a heavy quantity of bud
Hit the  chevy, as I flip to the mall scopin out the bitches
On the strip
Shorts glued down to they hips
Gotta a special kinda cup for my cognac
Cuzz I lean back, take a sip, and show these hoes where my love at
Ridin down the avenue followin a stranga
Stack it to the wall as I fire up another blunt
MJG druker than a muthafuckin fish with thirty-seven bitches in my dick
I got another destination ain't no use in chillin wit these hoes
Cuzz bitches want riches
And I
Being the type of hustler that I am really don't give a god damn
B-U-S-I-N-E-double S is what I'm all about
Put'em in a middle of a playaz night out

Just a Pimp",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-playerz-night-out-lyrics
Anotha Day In Tha Hood,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"Eightball the Fat Mac must express
While a nigga's gettin zooted from the potent-ass sess
Lookin back, damn, I was wild as a juvenile
Mama showed love and she struggled for her only child
But like my dad I was stuck in the streets
I never wanted to work hard, cause that shit ain't for me
Back then only 16, ignorant and curious
Mom's gettin ferious cause I wasn't serious
I said fuck school teachers and the church preachers
I wanted to hang with my niggas with the street sweepers
Back in the days sellin herbs on the 
Me and Squeaky doin city-wide talent shows
Gettin dissed, gettin pissed cause of this shit
Cause it's so hard in this muthafuckin business
I said many times, ""Mama, I'ma make you proud""
But I could never leave the thug life of Orange Mound
I'm on the corner drinkin Thunderbird
, 
slingin rocks
They in my hands cause the cops know 'bout the matchbox
But I can't sell dope, rappin is the way, gee
And this is just another day around the homies

..mid day, I was deep into a sleep
Unconscious from that hate that they distribute on em streets
My world was constantly spinnin from the Remy that was in me
And we ain't half-stepped on them blunts, we chiefed up plenty
A penny to be earned in a day is what I'm looking for
Hopin for, some kind of way to make a little more ducats
Fuck it, shit that I just needed, I just stuck it
Up, hell, nigga might as well
Proceed to hustle like a p-i-m-p
MJ fuckin G
The nigga with the muthafuckin clout, no doubt
The pimps is in the muthafuckin house
Be up out , black folk is takin over
You know how I know? Gimme the mic and I show ya
I teach ya, I reach ya with this pimpalistic knowledge
The shit a nigga learned back in Break-A-Bitch College
Started, to hustle at the age of 11
Started makin money when a nigga turned 12
Started to induldge at the age of 13
At 14 a nigga flatfoot was raisin hell
In the muthafuckin hood

So many rappers in this industry, I don't doubt
That it's a bunch of niggas broke with a CD out
It ain't new to me, cause me and MJG
Had to struggle just to hustle down in Tennessee
In Memphis, tryin to be a rapper
But rappin don't mean shit to Elvis Presley-lovin crackers
Plus I'm with a record label gankin me and fuckin me
Niggas always promsisin me shit that I will never see
Trick-buster always talkin 'bout we family
But while I was rappin he was snortin up my royalty
So I got smart, hit the streets and said fuck that
That's when this nigga named T Money heard our first track
Pack em up, move em out, straight down to Texas
Me and JG ridin drop-top Lexus
""Coming Out Hard"" on the charts in the 'Billboard'
Second album droppin and we waitin on our first award
Niggas talkin cause the crew ain't walkin no mo'
Them jealous busters tryin to start shit over hoes
I don't know what is worse, livin bad or livin good
But the whole world remind me of my neighborhood

See, I'm a self-made hustler, trustin the
Niggas who think that two heads are better than one
And ready to get the job done, son
MJG gots game in the street sale
That makes me get lifts in the studio
Even though it was kind of hard as far as I can see
Growin up in the Orange Mound Tennessee community
Could it be the future had love for a nigga who
Struggled through all type of shit for a bill or two?
Still I do shows for my fans cause my fans buy my tapes
And the tapes make my g's and the g's keeps me straight
And I hate when the busters smile all in my face like a hoe
And talk shit in the down low
Look out, punk, mutha-fucka, sucka, niggas
My finger's gettin tired of the trigger, dig a
Grave, shit, cause I don't want his boys to have to deal
With the smell of the trick I just killed
???? if you can't hang with the stress, best
Wipe the big 'S' off your muthafuckin chest
Press issues, makin sure they fully understood
'bout a young nigga life in the muthafuckin hood",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-anotha-day-in-tha-hood-lyrics
Crumbz 2 Brixx,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"In this game of life I’m the target, I duck and I dodge shit
But in the end I just can’t win, I still end up getting hit
These hoes think I slang birds ‘cause I’m living comfortable
Fool, I had to struggle ‘cause my father ain’t Cliff Huxtable
22 years of hustling, now I’m paid
And every nigga and his momma think that they got it made
And these bitches out for a fat nigga riches
Think they getting a nigga sprung ‘cause I’m getting into them britches
I’m a player, not an actor; see, pussy ain’t no factor
The fact is the funds, and if there ain’t none, then I’m outie, mayne
Hard from the start, trained to sniff out player haters
I’m just that nigga that know it’s always gonna get greater later
Niggas fighting for hoes and hoes pimp ‘em well
And most of them bustas end up dead or in a jail cell
Hoodrat hoes tellin’ these bustas (“Baby, I love you”)
When that busta drop off that cheese (“Ooh, baby, I love you”)
When that busta mouth go down south (“Damn, baby, I love you”)
When that real nigga step in (“Nigga, fuck you”)
Crumbs to bricks, what is the definition of this phrase
Blaze the spliff, my nigga, ‘cause you will never know

Crumbs to bricks, crumbs to bricks
Why these niggas wanna turn crumbs to bricks?
Crumbs to bricks, crumbs to bricks
Why these bitches wanna turn crumbs to bricks?
Crumbs to bricks, crumbs to bricks
Why these niggas wanna turn crumbs to bricks?
Crumbs to bricks, crumbs to bricks
Why these bitches wanna turn crumbs to bricks?

Young nigga got problems and don’t know how to solve them
What’s a good solution for this busta ass pollution?
Confusion is evident when dealing with that Iz-eight the grizeat
Fresher than Colgate but more scandalous than Watergate
Hoes better recognize, niggas need to wise up
Crumbs on the table got us niggas living fucked up
Hoes got their hands out, niggas got their hands out
Jealous muthafuckas sniffin’, keepin’ a nigga’s ass out
Jackin’ ain’t the way for me, slangin’ ain’t the way for me
Crumbs to bricks defined by MJ-fucking-G
(“Crumbs to bricks, crumbs to bricks
Player haters wanna turn crumbs to bricks”)

Nothin’ but muthafuckin’ hoe shit, make me go get my killer big six shooter
Watch me move a busta through the wall and break ya
Look how I pumped it, look how we dumped him, he was slippin’
So he was victim, another pistol grippin’, nigga
Look how the trigger release the hammer to the pin
Another sucka gone in the wind
Over what? I still wonder what took him under
Even though I was the executioner, what was the use in the
Way he approached me with no respect
Therefore the only result will be put you in check
Next time if you leave your nuts, turn around, pluck ‘em in your ass
Think about your home turf and run fast
I realize that shit is getting niggas hit
Niggas froze, and making niggas whoop hoes
It ain’t no room for you muthafuckin’ brick stackers
Fuck you nothin’-to-do ass crumbsnatchers
The definition of the topic:
A nigga with a pebble in his hand but a boulder in his back pocket
Got many doing something small, something real petty
Some shit that eventually started to get heavy
The only reason for the shit as far as I can see
You ain’t got shit to do so you wanna fuck with me
About a bitch I’m fucking with you used to fuck with
Oh, is it true you wanna peel shit with the click?
‘Cause the company you keep is just like you
Small-minded bustas who ain’t got shit to do
So you’re your eyes wide open for them hoes and them tricks
Who out to turn crumbs into bricks

Yeah, MJ-muthafuckin’-G in the house
Letting y’all know exactly what we mean by turning a crumb into a brick
Really, the way we said this should’ve been self-explanatory
But let me break it down for you:
It’s just as simple as taking small shit like sand and dust
Trying to build a house with that shit
But what y’all need to do, y’all need to cease with tha shit
Cease with that hot sauce and get with this ketchup
‘Cause this shit is thick like 57
And we in this muthafucka for the 9-4
And Suave out; peace, baby

Why you bustas wanna turn crumbs to bricks?”)",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-crumbz-2-brixx-lyrics
Lick’Em Up Shot,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"Here it is, we come to dance in the ‘94
Eightball and MJG together with the South Circle, see
We gon’ do it like this for all them boys, so check it

We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
Lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
Lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
Lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
Lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
Lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

Check one, on the mic, it’s the fat mack, freakin’ on this phat track
Peep my khakis saggin’ and my gat in my backpack
Gangsta Memphis, home of players and Uzi sprayers
But me, I’m just a hustler, fuckin’ poetic rhyme sayer
Iz-eight-bizall, will make a new nigga fall
Then send him to the land of the Orange Mound killer clan
Him being the enemy, meaning he’s not down with me
Meaning he didn’t come up in the muthafuckin’ Mound with me
I got a posse thick as hinds if you did not know
Some of them are jackin’ but the other half slang dope
Gangsta, straight from the bottom, got ‘em sick with this
Flavor that was made up by that nigga named T-Mix
Blast him, bucked him, let him eat the hollow tips
Snatch him like a bitch and then beat him with the pistol grip
Danger, anger, overload, explode
Go into my ‘fuck the world’ mode, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
Lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

Just give me a muthafuckin’ reason to demonstrate a pimpin’ type appeal and
I’m peelin’ caps in your muthafuckin’ nose
And I’m drillin’ holes in your coffin
Quite often, I have to show these niggas who the boss and
Keep tossin’ these hoes upside the muthafuckin’ wall
These bitches eatin’ supper out my fine silk drawers
Because I plays my card, and I likes to H-U-S-
T-L-E, MJ-fucking-G
Ain’t gonna be another busta in my future talking shi
‘Cause he don’t know who he fuckin’ with
See, it’s the P-I-M-P-I-N-G in me
It keeps me totally about the M-O M-O-N-E-
Why these niggas front with this bullshit I don’t understand
Shady ass busta, sticky ass hand
You run for cover when my muthafuckin’ bomb drop
On you and your crew, nigga, lick ‘em up shot

We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

Southern Funkadelic terrorist got ‘em scared of this
Young nigga making a fat grip being a lyricist
Kill with the muthafuckin’ Glock if I’m forced to
Break a nigga off and leave ‘em shorter than tattoo
Peace and much love to the niggas that I’m down with
The niggas that I clown with that’s down with this South shit
Hard from the start, so many players on my family  tree
Meaning there was many doing this shit before it came to me
Hard times made a nigga write a lot of hard rhymes
Fuck walking a chalk line, mayne, I gots to get mine
Death wish, click goes the clip in my piece
One in the chamber for the jackers and the crooked police
No more peace without a piece, a nigga life will cease
For your herringbone or the phat ride you crease
If you got nuts thinkin’ that I’m droppin’, I’m not
Lick ‘em up shot, nigga, lick ‘em up shot

Here comes the muthafuckin’ nigga, with his own type of rhythm
Get ‘em, up, nigga, nigga, get ‘em
Up, if you wanna, come jack it
Step, make a move, ‘cause I’m packin’
What, ever it, takes for
Me to get a nigga up off me
MJG rollin’, down the strip dodgin’, dips drinkin’ Crown
I’ma sip one more fifth
I’ma chief six more spliffs
I’ma drop these sucka ducks
Run ‘em over like Mack trucks
Dumpin’ bustas in a lake
I gotta dispose ‘em out their way
Straight up, sucka nigga, you gets popped
Fuckin’ with this clique, lick ‘em up shot, nigga

We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga

We ain’t a joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
We stinkin’ murderers
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
We stinkin’ murderers
When me rhyme, me no play, me no joke
We stinkin’ murderers
They’re picking up the place like they’re a big time hustler
Their gun in their waist, a millimeter
They’re coming out again ‘cause buy can got ‘cause we…

We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em up shot, nigga
We lick a shot, lick a lick a shot
We lick a shot, lick ‘em shot, nigga

Here it is, we’re coming to dance in the ‘94
8Ball & MJG together with the South Circle…
And we’re gonna lick up shots to all them boys…",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-lickem-up-shot-lyrics
No Sellout,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"Tell me what's goin on, damn, I need help to see
I have chains on my brain from the strain of the
Mental corruption eruptin through this industry
All I see is New York rappers back and forth on BET
See, I'm the first true southern funkadelic preacher
Drink a 'yac and smoke a blunt and watch it get deeper
But not so deep I have to perpetrate to gain respect
Instead of judgin me you need to get yourself in check
And I'm not gonna be the wanna-be you want to see
Oh no, I cannot sell my soul

MJG for the Nine-Fo, what's it gonna be?
Another year for the p-i-m-p in the street
Yes, it's me, the one who clocks when it's time to get explicit
It's comin from the truth when I kick it
So dear critic, you thinkin on terms of how it needs to be
I'm tellin you how it is and what I has to live and what I got to give
To the ears of the ones who wanna listen
Some don't understand,, so they really don't know what they're missin
Hard times made hard heads in the South
You get respect bein real, no sell-out

In '93 I was rappin about my curls and my Cadillac
The pimp blast, takin you fast, smokin grass and all that
Players got the message, busters didn't attempt to listen
Thinkin that we was talkin about that on-the-corner fake pimpin
Hell yeah, I'm that player from the underground
All-black assassin from the neighborhood of Orange Mound
They don't understand, why, they being society
The white people who run this nation got somethin against me
Me bein a young black male with an education
Teachin this pimpin, so the blacks will one day rule this nation
But every day another brother tries to kill me
Jack me because of the poverty in communities
Where you either have to sell crack or jack, man
What I'm tryin to stress to you is, don't step to the fat man
Because today I'm rappin, rockin shows and pullin hoes
But tomorrow I might be on the cut slingin dope
See, in the studio I'm killin fools vocally
But if it came down to it, I could do it silently
Fuck the President, the media can quote me
Listen to them lyrics, fool, I ain't sellin out, gee

You gotta be hard in this business, ain't no suckers, ain't no sell-outs
It's the way that you go in it, that's the way you gonna go out
First of all: never break up with them hustlers that you started with
Long as this happens you and your click won't accomplish sh...
Should've thought about it real hard
Now how could any group that's meant to be together be apart?
And if you start with a strong mind, think with a strong mind
B-u-s-i-n-e-ss time
I'm in the lab, chiefin hay, comin up with gold
Pimp mobile, hit the reel, let the platinum roll
See, I was taught, not the easy, but the hard way
Hustle after hustle after hustle each and every day
I gotta stay down to earth, cause I'm from Orange Mound
See, that's my hood, understood in the M-Town
Memphis-bound players, pimp type, black, strong, young
Level-headed Tennesseee, hustlers got it goin on
Bad to the bone when I roam through the area
Carry a, automatic weapon for my burial
When it's all over what it is and what it's all about?
Stay true to your homies and your music, no sell-out",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-no-sellout-lyrics
No Mercy,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"One nigga found dead in the bayou
That's the beginning of this story that I'm telling you
I was in the 9-tre smokin' a spliff on the strip
Seen a little cutie with some bootie..stop to shoot the shit
She was on my dick cause in the hood, I had a little rank
She was the kind of ho tryin' to take a nigga for his bank
But what she did not know, a nigga had a plan for that
Take her out to dinner then knock that ass up in my cadillac
All of a sudden, my beeper started buzzin' on the side of me
The code read 33..I knew it was MJG
Step to the mobile phone..G was talkin' crazy
This ho heard some niggas say them laws are out to get me
That night, I was dumpin that bitch in the ditch
Did not know that I was doin it in the presence of a snitch
Got dope from the scenery..thinkin I was scot-free
And now, I'm duckin and dodgin tryin to keep it low-key
Spliffed-out, ridin in my hooptie on cloud 9
Doin about 50 when a nigga pass 1-Time
Now they got a nigga faced-down on the sidewalk
Talkin all that punk ass rookie pig cop talk
What was in my pocket..Grabbin all my money and my beeper
Ramblin through my car, the pigs found my 9mm
Now, I'm in the county callin G to come and get me
Wandering who is the snitch callin these laws tryin to sell me out
Oh no! My mind is getting paranoid
A nigga can't even trust his own homeboys
As a result, I'm always alone
Except for some of the hoes I bone
Most of the time, I watch the news while I get my smoke on
Thousands after thousands on a lawyer who ain't doin shit
Locked up in this house a nigga 'bout to have a fuckin fit
Last night, I seen my face on the news..G
Some nigga who worked for me..slipped and lost an uzi
Now, I'm on the run..livin like a fugitive
I thought to myself on the run ain't no way to live
I thought I'd party hard and smoke and drank this century
Now, I'm slowly dyin in this penetentery...

Sesshead Funk Junky,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

Time for me to smoke, blaze a spliff of hay
Got no time for the stress so don’t bring it my way
I’m the god of smoke, the almighty chiefer
Roll another spliff so I can make you a believer
Choke as I smoke as I reach for my 4-O
Beeper going off but my weed come before hoes
Mary Jane, I’m in love with this hoe
Ain’t no pussy in the world that can fuck with that indo
First, take a blunt, cut it down the middle
Why do I smoke blunts? ‘Cause papers are too little
Fill it to capacity, lick ‘em up and stick ‘em up
Dry it you’re your lighter then fire it up and take a puff
Straight to a nigga’s brain, that’s what  made me a junkie
It keeps my head bobbin’ to whatever sounding funky
If I was down with Nancy Reagan, I’d say no to drugs
But I’m in Orange Mound with the pimps and killer thugs
All my niggas drink ‘gnac and smoke hella weed (Really?)
Well, t-Money is the only nigga drug-free
But me, I’m like an Energizer battery
Still smoking and smoking and smoking and smoking…

Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

Can I be a funk junky?
 (Yes, you can)
Can I be a funk junky?
 (Of course, you can)
Can I be a funk junky?
 (Yes, you can)
Can I be a funk junky?
 (Of course, you can)
Come on, can I be a funk junky?
 (Yes, you can)
Can I be a funk junky?
 (Of course, you can)
Can I, can I be a funk junky?
 (Yes, you can)
Now can I be a funk junky?
 (Of course, you can)

Check it out, uh
Now my daddy told me, “Boy, don’t be swinging on your own nuts”
But, my nuts are the only nuts that I have to own up to
So what in the fuck is a nigga to do
When I make more money when I’m hanging with the crew?
Now I’m like, um, hell yeah, open up the door
‘Cause it’s the B-R, we are comin’ at you once more
With this ill flow, real flow, light another joint so
Me and my niggas can straight to the point and anoint
Any muthafucka who wants to be down and see
It’s so many niggas wanna be G’s now
Freeze froze and close doors on those
Wannabe pros knowing that they hoes
‘Cause it’s Breed with the funkdafied fried lied laid to the side
Pass the joint and I’m tired type shit
Split me a blunt and fill it up with dank
Don’t ask me if I’m smoking, what the fuck you think?

Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)
Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

Give me a chance to enhance on this muthafuckin’ reefer
Let me teach a young bitch how to smoke ‘til she choke
One puff got her fiendin’ for a whole sack
Can’t hold back on the indo and don’t try to pretend no
Nigga ain’t ever had the tip of his blunt in your nose
About to let the smoke roll
Baby, I’m a 24-7 bud smoking poet
You should know it ‘cause the red in my eyes show it
King Edward of the hood
Quarter-pound toting, big smoking going on in the Backwoods
I got the mask, Breed got the bomb
Ball got the chief and the liquor it’s reached
And we each got love for the Capital W
Double-E-D as we talks to the industry
80 Proof in my hand as I stand
Gotta go to the wall ‘cause I think I’m ‘bout to fall
After all this getting fucked up
Nigga still got a pound in the closet and a halfway-full cup
So what’s up with the worldwide bud lovers?
Smoke one with the sesshead funk brothers
Step right up, son, hit me with a shotgun
But buckle up, you’ve gotta take one to give one
And that’s the way it gotta be
MJG, full of that muthafuckin’ sess tree

Smoke, smoke with me tonight
(A sesshead funk junky, oh)

So What U Sayin,On The Outside Looking In,1994,"Hoo…hey, listen baby, oh no no, oh
Hey, listen baby, hoo…

MJ-fucking-G and I’ll still be a fucking victim
Stick them, things into the air and then I pick them
Punks who, thought that they could catch me on the creep tip
Three slip, quickly when I unloaded my 9 clip
As I tip slowly to my muh-fuckin’ Lexus
Next it’s trouble for a nigga down in Texas
Check this: police pull me over on the highway
Why they, jack me up, I don’t know, so I act and I stay
Heartless toward the muthafuckin’ system
Get them devils out the office then I trick them
Suckas, crackers musta thought I was a cookie, rookie
Cop got dropped when he took the notion
That he could fuck with me, it was a dream
A pump or, somethin’ in his hand made him run up, sun up
A Klansmember really got me fucked up, plus us
Black folks ain’t goin’ for that stuff, nigga, so what you sayin’

Money (ho, so much money) and bitches (and bitches, baby)
Candy paint (candy paint) and switches (and switches)
Top let down, and I’m sky high (and I’m sky high, baby)
So what’cha sayin’, nigga? I’ma get by

Hell yeah, a real nigga, straight from the streets of the Mound
With nappy hair and gold teeth shining under my crown
And I must pack the fat bud sack
And my gat for the niggas who don’t know how to act
Fuck that, gotta be a rebel in the 9-4
Hell is waiting for me, but I refuse to go
Cops try to treat me just like Rodney
Pull a nigga over but they did not see the Uzi
What must I do, should I blast on the 5-O?
Then I’ll be another black man on death row
Sitting in my cell asking God for forgiveness
God will forgive me, but crackers won’t forgive this
Black nigga taught to kill by the white man
Television got me wantin’ to live like the white man
So I take a look around my neighborhood
Liquor stores and pawn shops covering every block

Money (ho, so much money) and bitches
Candy paint (love my paint job) and switches
Top let down, and I’m sky high (so high, so high)
So what’cha sayin’, nigga? I’ma get by

Guess I’m a thug with the mind of a pimp plus the heart of a hustler
Trust a, dollar and my momma, fuck a busta
Must a, sucka get noid in my presence
Hell yeah, bitch, I got the thug type of essence
Plus I, underestimate just how I rough I
Can hit when I’m mixed up in all type of shit
I’m a community outcast, and I’m causing lots of trouble
So call them fuckin’ folks on the double
But a couple of badge-wearing bitches ain’t gon’ stop me
Drop the, bombs on your muthafuckin’ ass when I pop the
Pins out these 20-inch grenades
And spray, your ass in the past when you play
Yourself tryna level with a giant, a chiefer
Constantly chiefin’ hay a.k.a. potent reefer
Teach a, older bitch a newer trick and keep a
Hustle on my mind all the time, nigga, so what you sayin’

Money (money, baby) and bitches (oh, and bitches)
Candy paint (candy paint) and switches (oh, and switches)
Top let down, and I’m sky high (so high, so high)
So what’cha sayin’, nigga? I’ma get by (get by, baby)

Eightball and MJG on this funky funky rec
Mark ass niggas get checked when they disrespect
Pimpin’ at its finest from the heart of Memphis, Tennessee
Busta muthafuckas need to open their eyes and look at the
World as I see it, but to me, a nigga never will
Comprehend through the message that I send, which is real
Niggas like me from the M-O-U-N-D
We just smoke and try to meditate, avoiding those who player hate
Real niggas have to carry gas when it’s necessary
Players haters planning to jack me, I’ll have to wet ya
Bet ya, rappers who be talking all that tough shit
Front them hoes like men and watch ‘em fold like a punk bitch
Weak ass niggas get raised in the studio
Fuckin’ around with me, I’m tryna put you in a grave, hoe
Pray no nigga wants to this step mack pimp in this
The South Click, so what you sayin’, bitch?

Money (money, money, money) and bitches (oh, and bitches)
Candy paint (oh, I love my paint job) and switches (oh, and switches)
Top let down, and I’m sky high (so high, so high)
So what’cha sayin’, nigga? I’ma get by (I’ma get by)

Space Age Pimpin’,On Top Of The World,1995,"I want you
I got to have you
But what will this lead to
Will it just be me and you
Tell me.... you know I want you
Tell me how you feel

I'll be obliged if you step outside
Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating, awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger, I lasted longer
Than I've ever lasted, your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test, you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh, I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass, I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will, what must I do
Would ya kill for me, ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me, ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me, ya if the way you act is true
Who knows, fine clothes
Lexus doors you'll be closing, when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places, different faces
Different cases, got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG, you ain't gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P, claiming that you ain't heard of me
Keeping it real, let me know how you feel when we communicate
We'll be straight, if you express your mind
Instead of preferring her weight, some who can't do it
Lose women, but nigga like me used to it
Space Age Pimping

New day, new age
Every once in awhile this is how we slang our game
New day, new age
Nothin is too strong
New day, new age
When setting it out is all we straight to do
New day, new age
Just me and you, just me and you

You and I, me and you; situation getting sticky
Your mouth is saying no, but your body's saying stick me
Lick me, don't be afraid of what your friends say
Rappers get dat ass, then be outta here like yesterday
But not tonight, you look so tight
It feels so right, this indo got me perving
Let's go hop in my Suburban
And ride til we get to where you want to be, no matter how far
Just call me Oball baby, to me you're the superstar
Ask me time and time again why did I choose you
Do I wanna be your man or just misuse you
I hear your partners dissing
When they think I ain't listening
Them hoes just be wishing
They could be in yo position
With me in luxury
I got to be everyday
Chiefin' hay with something stout wearing lingerie
Let's hit the ’tel
Get a suite
An order something to eat
Tell me things about you
I'll tell you things about me
Then out the blue I'll be carressing you, undressing you
You start doing all shit you said you'd never do
Lustin busting all out of my boxer drawers
Fingers dripping slipping in an out in an out
Constantly telling me the things you don't do
Yet you do it like a pro and think I don't know
But I do that's why I'm here with you and you know this
Slip on the latex, and dive in

Friend or Foe?,On Top Of The World,1995,"Anyway, it doesn't matter much how you feel
You know what you got to do, I'm here to do it
How about you?

Our age, five-years-old
We were young bucks
Scrubbin' each others backs in the bathtub
Babysitter sing you to bed
But she would make me stay up
So she could give the young playa' some vicious head uh
Early symptoms of
Time of nightway
(Time of nightway)
Gigantic factor from the
Carquinez Bridge team
Some had it all though (All though)
But less unfortunate
You had an alloy spoke Mongoose
And I had a Huffy
You owned a green machine
(Green machine)
Three different lunch pails
I had a go-cart that I built from a bunch of used nails
We grew up in the church together, nigga
Sunday school
Now I heard you off into jackin', nigga
That ain't even cool (That ain't cool)
I used to be conned, racked and fucked around
And ripped bad
Barking up on the wrong tree
Talking about runnin' up in my pad

Niggas have hateful thoughts
But they can't stop me from strivin'
Suckas be shakin' salt
All in his game falsifyin'
Some fools be gettin' crossed
Victims of faultiness
Man, all that drama you come with
I swear you on some shit
Whether it's morphine or cocaine
Doja or dog food
That have these marks betrayin' macks
Fuckin' off my high breakin' rules
You got ya P's mixed up
You ain't no pimp
You's a phony
I spit for major mints
While you make tapes for ya homies
And then you work up the nerve
To speak foul words
The perpetrators be instigators
That's why I wrote this verse
For every youngster with his mind on his meal
Young playa just chill
And take a look at what these fakers call real
Nigga

I trust no man
'Cause man will let you down every time
That's why I take it upon myself to thank God in every rhyme
'Cause I've seen better times
And I've seen worse days
When some of my so-called friends
Wasn't around when I ain't have a verse to say
I quench my thirst today
With righteous thoughts of mind
'Cause righteous thought of mind will leave mark ass niggas far behind
I seen it every time
They come and go
That's why I drop to my knees
And ask God to distinguish friend from foe
And what do you know?
By the time morning comes, I can see the light
And then I'm thanking God, once again, for making everything all right
He made it tight and now I'm back up on the scene
Countin' greens
Straight from H-town to New Orleans
New human beings, puttin' it down like a mic or not
Replace the slot, open up shop
We 'bout to make it hot
Stop!
With ya devilish doins
Because ya devilish doins will only bring forth ya ruin

Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
(No, you never know)
Who can you trust in a world that's, oh, so cold
Playa hatin' is everywhere I go
(Everywhere I go, go, go, go)
Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
(Oh no, you never know)

Listen
I'm tryin' to tell you, my nigga, to watch ya back
And trust few
'Cause ain't no nigga gon' watch ya back for you, like you
When someone is broke, and down, and out without no doubt, it's rough
At least you know who you can, and who you cannot trust
See, let me explain myself, and clear up the point I'm tryin' to make
Don't want no bustas around me
Playa hatin' or actin' fake
Don't ever be wantin' nobody to get too close
I don't know if it's, effects of from the marijuana, that got me 'noid and trippin'
See, nowadays the nigga be rollin' thick with hella loot
But if my loot was gone, would I be all alone?
See, my partners who used to ride with me
And smoke that dank, and fuck with hoes
Would they be them same niggas if I didn't have shit to roll?
Maybe they will, maybe they won't
Who is to say what a nigga will do
Who is to say if you help someone, it's guaranteed that they'll help you
See what I'm sayin', listen to me and see if you can dig this
Smilin' faces replaces friends when people receive ends
Now all of a sudden I'm actin funny, 'cause my money's loaned
But there was no drama when I was livin' at my momma's home
But I'm not tellin' a nigga, nothin' you don't already know
Personal or business, you got to watch who you friends is

I'm thinking about hard times
Freeing my mind
Who in the fuck goin' be my crutch?
Holdin' me up, helpin' me out
Makin' sure that I stay in touch
Where do I sleep
Who do I turn to, when I be low on my cash
Who am I down with, when fifty niggas be talkin' bout kickin' my ass?
Who is my friends, who is my foes?
Who do I ask, when I want to know
Somethin' about somethin', but I don't know nothin'
My ignorance keepin' me out in the cold
Who do I call, when I'm in need of a ride?
In somebody else's car
How do I get from point A to B, if B is just too far?
Where can I get a loan, where can I use the phone?
Who's gonna' give me the permission to make a decision
To come up in they house and live?
When will I drive a Beemer, takin' my clothes to the cleaner?
How can I know?
Will I forever be payin' my dues, will I forever be singing the blues?
Where will I find a shoulder, when I be wantin' to lean?
Know what I mean?
When I be needin' some justification
Stuck in the fuckin' same location
Who is the friend that is helpin' me?
Who is the busta that's hurtin' me?
Who can I trust?
Will you be there when the goin' is tough?
Will I be hangin' with dick in the dust?
Who wanna' share my load when it's too heavy to carry?
Or will I go crazy pullin' the load alone?
Constantly gettin' my hustle on
When will I finally see, kinda' suspect
Or even actually know
Who is my real friends, thick and the thin?
And who in the fuck is the foe?

Friend or foe
(Oh, friend or foe)
You just will never know
Who can you trust in a world that's, oh, so cold
Playa' hatin' is everywhere I go
Friend or foe
(Oh friend, or foe)
You just will never know
Friend or foe

But trying  I usually go through it
But so we do it like a mack, in fact, I keep my cool
You ask me who my master is, I say my gun rules
It choose only to make moves with a certain pack
The real pack, ’cause them bustas try to hold you back
In fact, I could name a few, but I ain't gon’ waste
No precious time talkin' about them on my precious tape
Pussy sucka—in disguise, undercover
Fake brothas—tryin' to come between another
Just like a wedge and some wood
Tryin' to put a split in your shit, slick busta up to no good
As I kick back, smoke a beedi with the needy

He tryin’ to tell me ’bout some shit Farrakhan said
I try to listen cause 8ball ain't the one to knock it
But I can't hear over the echo from my empty pocket
Instead of sweating me, fool, sweat Chuck D
Cause I been true to playa shit since ’83
Southern funkadelic preacher, I'm here to reach ya
Don't be so prejudiced, and let my holy words teach ya
I never rap about sets, ’cause I ain't been through that
Even though a nigga did dirt and packed straps
I don't do what you do, and you don't see what I see
Therefore we could not be the same, do you feel me?
I come from Tennessee and love drinkin’ Hennessy
Peace to KRS, but here’s my philosophy
I got the remedy four seconds after now
Yo my nig’, tell ’em who you is

Who am I?
MJG, Pimp Tight
Knock on wood twice, pour the drinks, dim the lights
What I say, is every day, P-O-etry
The R-E-A-L, same shit that I sell
Hell, you gon’ do yo’ thang, I’m gon’ do mine
Fine, I’m gon’ sip some wine
You might find some other way to pass your time
It ain’t bout where you from, it’s bout what you do
And doin’ wrong gon’ make clues, so trouble gon’ stick to you
True blue pimp shit is hard to break
But playa hatin’ bustas put the icin’ on the cake
Hate to see they own homies with a few ends
And still wonder why they can’t get no dividends
A man ain’t who he say he is
If he gotta give false information, ’bout what he had and how he live
And don’t shit but the truth set you free
So trick, stop all that lyin’, get those shackles ’way from me
He who tells the first lie gets the first smack
A chain react on the mack, flossin’ fake facts
A freaky naked hoe  makes no record deal
Perpetrators, get for real

""When hard times seem to find you (yeah, that's for real)
When all your good days behind you (yeah, that's for real)
When there's no sofa to recline to (yeah, that's for real)
And you just constantly have to pay a due (yeah that's for real)
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money
E’ybody gonna say you done changed
And e’ry motherfucka think e’ry other motherfucka tryin’ to find a new hold in the game

See in my past, I thought it was all in my mind
But in time, I came to find, people are blind
To the fact, I don’t give a fuck about your thoughts
Motherfuck the radio and fuck the magazine talk
Walk with the playa down the highway of what I say
Hear what I say is just another way to make me paid
Instead of gettin’ sprayed or runnin’ from police
I am in the studio, smoked out, bustin’ rhymes
And jealous hoes, male and female
Been givin’ a nigga hell, now that I am 
Jealous of the fact that my mack is not an act
Instead of packin’ gats, I’m strapped with my DATs
And all my homies slang dope for a livin’
Or livin’ in a prison ’cause they couldn’t fade the system
I miss them, but still I gots to get up on my 
I’m on a mission so the future won’t see me in prison
Niggas come to me with demos of they poetry
I try to listen, cause I used to be that nigga, G
Now do you feel me?
I hope you feel these
Words, from Iz-8-Biz-all, for real

""When hard times seem to find you (yeah, that's for real)
When all your good days behind you (yeah, that's for real)
When there's no sofa to recline to (yeah, that's for real)
And you just constantly have to pay a due (yeah that's for real)
But if you broke shit straight till you make a little money

All In My Mind,On Top Of The World,1995,"They told me to come clever, whatever
It dont make, it's on you
So I be who I be, and do what I gotta do
I'm one of the few, the proud and the pimpest
In this business I be the swiftest when I kick this
As if you didn't know it's Thorough from that Suave Camp
Best Vemp chimped, or get licked like a mail stamp
Amps and beats, technics is what I come with
Gangsta's and pimps and balla's is who I fuck with...

FUCK nobody safe when I see demons in tha mirror
Wicked as fuck feeling like a Murder & Killa
Witness I'm on the defense like Johnny Cochran
NOW GIVE UP YO THANGS MISTA, before this Glock hit the proper spot
Blocks on phones, they won't leave they homes, peeping through cracks
Cause blacks be coming back with all that past crap
Strap on your bullit proof vest and combat boots
It's NIGGA NIGGA DAY!!
And this time we go come on you
Baby blue disguise thats wise
Made me loose my 9-5 got myself a 4-5 im
Aimless spraying not playing with their vertabrates
These the Murda Dayz
So many niggas must come wicked
We done heard of wayz........

I see one, two, Niggas actin live
3 seconds past before I blast with my 4-5
6 shots, 7 cops, just to take 8ball
9 witnesses reported all the shit the recalled
Everlasting, blasting, niggas running fast when
Buckin gott'em ducking
Putting sucka's in the past tense
I be the holder of the gat therefore it shall not run
A psychic couldn't see such a feature for my momma's son
(Nigga) Breath taker, the overweight trouble maker
Fake trick breaker, Tennessee earthquaker
Shaking grounds when I'm walking smoking fat onion
I get lit, and beat the shit out of Paul Bunyon
Fightin, Clash of the Titans on your dial
I'm gettin blitzed stickin on medusa doggystyle
Word G, you heard me
The wicked bitch served
Now I'm playing soccer, gotta kick'em to da curb G
But she's not with it, put a spell on the fat mack
I hate stikin ho's but I can't help but to go back
I sound like a fiend, everytime is the last time
Could this be reality or all in my mind?......

Spill 9's like fluid, do it like some G's
They know me from Columbian streets to Portugeese
(nigga how u figga)
I got mo scratch than flea's
I got mo gat's than these
High powered sour nigga's
Steady slangin crack to fiend's
At ease, take a look at some black G's
Scopin the president, takin over residents like black kings
Stack G's with phat key's
Rats ease on your properties poppin me for my black jeans

I had a cracker on my scope and my finger still itchin
Visions of killing and then the strap start spittin, hittin
The prez, plottin payback on the devil
A rebel and a mason is what yall snakes facing
Chasing traders with my data cause I hata should be corpe
And peep game when it's being taught, or to picture this of us lyricists
Seeing nigga'z taking shots and the same nigga'z getting hit
Spit the gift and got fam like Gotti
Hittin her like hobbies
Killin everybody
Let my head grip the bed and I check the time
It's all a dream, I seen in my fuckin mind.....

280 pounds of hay, every damn day I gotta test a
25 lighters on my dresser , yessir
Breakfast being served by a ho that look like Genie
She press my every wish and keeps a tight ass bikini tini
Tiny as a Barbie Doll summer set
She all up in my house and I still ain't hit that pussy yet
I gives props to my butler, cause he know
That I know on the downlow he's a chiefin muthafucka for ya
Now as I flips through the calendar I spots the winter
If it ain't 3 mo freaky hoes wanna have dinner
But I can't do it cause my schedule just to tight
I just phoned, Quincy Jones said he needs my help tonight
He wanted me to pick the strong from the wimps
Them playa's with the limps to make a song called We Are The Pimps
I call's Ball, Ball calls the crew
We met up at the Penthouse, and Paris Round 2
Do , u know the code to the fence, if u dont
Then move on cause u ain't got no home in this residence
It's evident that I'm daydreaming high

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world

Uh, let me drop it on the one, it's the fat mack
Dope like an 8Ball, that's why people call me that
Some used to call me Mr. Big, but I had to flip
Now they call me Mr. Ruffle 'cause I'm all about my chips
Matter 'fact you need a jackhammer just to dig me
Orange juice and DT keep a playa tipsy
It only seems like yesterday thinking back
I had to work a job and hustle just to keep a sack
Stuck in Orange Mound, ten toes down
Nowhere to go but up, I'm underground I'm so down
But God bless me with this gift of poetry
So with this CD the world could see what I see
Came hard for them bustas on the outside looking in
Made mad ends with some paper and a pen than
Did it again, for all of ya'll
MJG and 8Ball sitting on top of the world
 x2
Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world

Keep that animosity that you got against me off your chest
'Cause you can't bring me down even if you tried your best
I guess is what I gotsta do
Separate myself from them bustas hang tight with my own crew
Some people hate to see me make it
And any opportunity they get where they can hurt me they go'n take it
I hate it, but 'too late, it gets rougher
My chrome plated thang blew your cover in the gutter
Of the brothers who don't know me well, claim that they do
And persistence turn a lie into the truth ain't no use
First of all I believe in God
I'm coming out hard
And I can finish anything you can start
Cross your heart
As I keep a tight grip on my tone
'Cause when I ain't at home it's gonna let me know that I ain't alone
I'm gone, mentally speaking
MJG, on top of the world diamondsand pearls all that I can see

Hey MJG MJG
And that nigga 8Ball and 8Ball
On top of the world on top of the world

I've seen so much from coast to coast and state to state
Bird slanging ballas, and the fakest of the fake
Getting paid, getting played, getting sprayed in the streets
While me and MJG getting paid freaking beats
We're versatile, south style, rap ability
I had to catch a plane that took me far from my community
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
But if you thinking this you never knew me from the gate mane
Much respect to young G's on the streets banging
And all my niggas who survive day to day swanging
And I'll keep serving all my dope vocally
'Cause its survival of the fittest, mentally

I've seen a lot of luxuries, fine cars, movie stars, social bars
Many women, fake friends in my face, nine ten
Even though I stack, don't stand down on my income
I never would forget about the streets that I come from
The drugs, the violence, not one day of silence
The robbing, the shooting, mothas prostitutin'
The Mound is my home, the hood im around
But if you jack me, your whole family going down
Your motha, your daddy, your aunty, your cousins
They all going out by the whole dirty dozen
M, JG, music in the streets scholar
On top of the world tryin to make a dollar

In The Line of Duty,On Top Of The World,1995,"Listen officer, I know I got a traffic warrant
But your wife got three, so where the fuck is she?
You don't know, so you bring your personal
Problems back to your job
And every damn day you make it hard
You can't understand
When you see a black man
Rollin in a new ride
Gotta pull him over and
Gotta check the inside
Hell, who in the fuck do you claim to be?
My help or my hurt, 'cause you ain't did shit for me
See, every time I rolls
Every time I walks
Every time I breathes and every time I talks
I'm always being heard, or either being watched
By scary ass white folks or crooked ass cops
They coming, they searching
They pat me on my abs
The sons of a slave on a (?) from the path
I laughs, knowing that these fellas must be jealous
They want our autographs but they don't know how to tell us
It's crazy the way you treat my kind
You call this your job?
The system must've brainwashed your mind
I really resent the rues a cop would use within a day
So if you talking that shit, it's in my duty to blow you away

Punk ass, rookie ass
Sissy ass mu'fuckin' police
Always in a mu'fucka's shit
Just got out the mufuckin' academy

I'm supposed to love America
But America don't love me
A son of a slave of the father of this country
Freedom wasn't meant to be a luxury for you and I
Freedom came after many influential people died
In vein, it seems
Ain't a whole lot changed
They still cracking whips and shackling up niggas mayne
Projects ain't nothing but modern day plantations
And the masters reside at the police stations
Replacing whips with berettas and clips on they hips
Quick to gang up on young brothas who make that grip
I used to think that stacking papers would eliminate
Lack of pussy to fucking police that player hate
I found out that a bitch is gonna be a bitch
And the police could give a fuck that a nigga's rich
Ol' white men from the days of the cotton pickers
Who used to ride around on pickup trucks lynching niggas
They them same peckerwoods acting like a hoe
When they see a nigga moving in next door
In front of my own home rough me up and harass me
And say you did it all in the line of duty

Coward ass police
Busters hiding behind a badge
All in a nigga's face
'Cause you can be strapped
I can be strapped too, hoe
Running with your gang
I'm running with my gang, bitch
You know what I'm saying?
You better step off this pimp shit, hoe

Here come the motherfucking plain clothes
Riding low-pro
In a fo' do', 95 Caprice
Trademark of the police
Each and every damn nigga
Wetback and (?)
Need to recognize before your mu'fuckin' ship sank
I don't think these laws got no love for minorities
This is how I know it be so fuck the majority
Pick em' out, one by one
Shoot em' down with my gun
Take em' to the woods, no mistake
Concrete shoes in the lake
I hate player hating perpetrating cops
The nerds of the school wanna run my fucking block
You wanna know my name, well trick it's MJG
So miss me with that shit, (?) you's a BC
What in the fuck do you expect to gain
Constantly pulling me over
Constantly throwing your salt into my game
You lame, weak busters, can't do me
Especially when you're out or even in the line of duty

I ain't taking it
Police hating the shit I represent
Street sense, Glock totin'
Ripping pigs chests open
Hating them like they hating me, soon as they see
Another colored brotha flapping in some luxury
All in my ass with some gloves looking for some drugs
Dogs sniff my balls, hell naw it ain't no love
Catch you slipping on your off day and spray your ass
Into the past as fire up one and hit the gas
I never did it but them busters make me wanna do it
Pull out the tech in a sec and leave em in the street wet
But that won't solve nothing
All that'll do is get me time
So I choose to write this rhyme and diss them hoes in every line
Sometimes, my mind wonders would the world be shocked
If we all did like Pac and bust at cops when we got stopped
Bet you shit would straiten up and start flying right
Bitch, it's judgement night
In the line of duty

What the fuck y'all punk motherfuckers looking for?
What the fuck do you see?
Shit
A goddamn thing
Talkin' bout what the fuck you smell
It ain't here
Bitch, you can't prove shit
Leave me the fuck alone, goddamn it
Is my tags out of date, hoe?
Hell naw, goddamn it
Do I got a motherfucking traffic warrant?
Fuck naw
Am I on your motherfucking warrant list?
Naw, bitch
So why the fuck you all up in my motherfucking shit, goddamn it?
I can't help it because your motherfucking wife's pussy ain't hitting right, goddamn it
I can't help it because your son made straight F's, goddamn it
I ain't got shit to do with that shit, goddamn it
I can't help it because you ain't paid the mortgage yet, bitch
You ain't got to put that shit out on me, hoe
I ain't got no record goddamn it
I ain't been to jail, you giving me motherfucking hell, hoe
Get out my shit, stay out my shit",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-in-the-line-of-duty-lyrics

Light up the bomb
Cause here I come
It's eight bizz-all
Got the remedy
Dr. Green Sticky got the cure for me
Pimp type, I'm so tight, taking flight
Like a kite when the wind blows
Creepin' in my Timbos
Most, hoes, know, I'm out to get the loot
Fuck being your boyfriend
Girl I wanna hit the boots
Jump deep in that rump
And then I gotta flap bitch
You should've known how a real nigga act
That's, why, I be about my P's and Q's
Cause hoes end up being bad news
Find 'em, fuck 'em, split 'em, forget 'em
Let the ho go so the next Joe can hit 'em
Real 'bout this playa shit, Suave came deeper than the ocean
Lil' Hane hit me with the potion
Floatin' - Cloud 9 is beneath me

A pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme
Pimp in my own fuckin' rhyme, yes I'm

And wearin' they niggas clothes

Scandalous groupie
Big choosy booty, outrageous hoes
Bitches and back rubs

Bubbles and bathtubs
Luxury hotels

Executive Strip Clubs

Holla if you hear me
Step off

If you trick bustas fear me
Hear the, pimp speakin'

For all and each and

For each and all
Now break 'em off somethin' Ball

Much real shit comin' from the two

Pimp niggas who survived
Comin' up payin' dues

Funky flippin'

Style switchin'

Niggas better pay attention
Before the automatic start spittin'
Listen, 8Ball be straight bubblin'
Slow ass niggas gettin' broke off by my tongue again

Comin' in, MJ fuckin' G
You better know the time

And I'm
Just a pimp in my own rhyme


Here comes the motherfuckin' player
The rhyme sayer, the bitch slayer
I break a young woman's back then I take her
Home, the thrill is gone, I gotta jet
The set before I get my ass in some mess
Sippin' Hennessey, till I finish the
Whole cup of the cognac, catchin' contacts
With the blunts back
Superfly, Mr. Gold, that is gettin' old
This'll label me a young goodie
Straight out the hoodie
I'm able to lay my game down in a single bound
And while I'm in the same town, smoke out on a pound
As I'm keepin' an eye for tight hoes
While I creep through the streets
While you sleep with the D's on my jeep
Peep this, 110% physical fitness
I lay the type of pipe to put a plumber out of business
Who is this manipulator? Demonstrator?
Pimp shit, top rater, trick hater
Bustas can't comprehend, but then again
They never could, too busy fuckin' off in them neighborhood
I'mma keep pimpin' rhymes, I'm out of my pimpin' mind

Funk Mission,On Top Of The World,1995,"Don't get high off your own supply

Used to be my best homie now I can't even trust ya
Must'a got turned out by a busta
Smokin fine reefer wasn't enough so
You graduated now you stuff your nose with that white ho
Niggas beginning to think powdered lips make em hip
Look at the other fiends, recognize where you slipped
Cause I remember the times we was smokin bud and drinkin wine
Now all of a sudden, out of nowhere you sniffin lines
And I'm able to say through all my pains and all my pressures
I kept my nose closed workin to keep my shit together
And why in the fuck you need a sniffin friend?
To sniff shit with yo ass, cause yo ass got conned in
Think again cause even if I'm having problems
Experimenting with other drugs ain't gon help me solve em
I tried fry and what in the fuck did it do for me?
Not a damn thing now that fry shit is history
Somebody's walkin around don't even know they own name
A couple of years later you'll be doing the same thing
I got love for the ones who had love from the jump
But go and tell my brothers fight the funk

Look at ya, trying to be like super fly, you fucked up
Now your world is a plastic bag of white dust
Sucka, busta, don't come round me with that
Real niggas use crack to make they pockets fat
We don't need no more zombies walkin dead amongst us
And fake brothas who corrupt the mind of our youngsters
Cocaine one way or another leaves the permanent scars
A life of drug abuse or worse, a life  behind bars
To some it's not a easy choice but it ain't hard for me
Fuck that white bitch cause I don't never wanna be
Somewhere trying to make up some kinda lie to say
Why this mothafuckin nose bleed won't go away

You got a fat piece of toilet paper stuck up in your nose pipe
You can't smell shit cause you been snorting through the whole night
I ain't tryin to say that I'm better than the next man
I understand anyone can do what they know they can
But you can't if you constantly looking for a way out
Stay out my path I ain't tryin to put the hand out
I lay out truth in stone so you can get deeper into the shit I'm sayin
While my tape is playin, need to listen up
Excuses, you keep using, who you foolin?
Nobody but yourself cause that  cocaine rulin
Now who's in fuckin charge of your decisions?
As long as you continue to fuck around with funk mission


Do you remember back in the day when niggas used to say
Don't get high off your own supply and make that pay
Paper, cheese, fetti, chips, grip, flo, stacks, loot, green, whatever you want to call that shit
Now on the serious tip for real here's what I've been thinkin
Our world is fucked up and it ain't just for one reason
Baby's come into this world hooked on drugs with aids
Hypocrites use religion just to get paid
But in my neighborhood I seen somethin hella drastic
It was tragic, it left a victim in a casket
Let me take ya back to sometime in the 70s
When old heads used the snow like we smoke weed
That shit was cool then but now let's take another look
Instead'a powder packs now you need yo shit cooked
Them cool niggas that used to kick a fro' and wear them stacks
He that nigga today starving tryin to buy some crack
Now some people say that all drugs is bad drugs
And in they eyes I'm a junkie cause I smoke bud
And so then God please forgive me for I have sinned
And forgive those who lived for the funk",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-funk-mission-lyrics

Distributin' crack wth my hand on my gat, fat
Not cause the spot be hotter than a torch
The fiends gettin' they pipe dreams on the back porch
I haven't been asleep, tryna stack chips, underneath my mattress
I gotta see the judge on the 5th
Until then I'm the cake cuttin' cookie making
Baking soda measurer, illegal money treasurer
Searchin' for an ultimatum, looking for a way out
Prison ain't the way for me so I'm tryna stay out
A couple of young niggas I know keep my yay' in steady flow
Even though I'm tryna stop my clientele continue to grow
So I want to quit and get legit and pay taxes
Practice new tactics with the cheese beneath my mattress
What should I do, open a soul food restaurant
Where all the ballers come after early morning blunts
What about a place for a tight stereo
Full of the best shit like autoradio
But I don't know it's a hard decision to make, mane
Tryna think of something to do to get out the game

What can I do?
What can I do to get out the game, get out the game
What can I do to get out the game

Hell ain't nothing like a laundry for your money
Cleanin' up all the fifth, turnin' that shit to honey
Funny how the barber and beauty and beeper shops
Occupy the spaces and places around the block
Charges gettin' too damn large for me to take
Rules gettin' too damn hard for me to break
Hate to stay out the game for so long
Tired of doin' shit for myself, it's feeling wrong
Niggas that I came up with is gettin' 'noid
Shoppin' with strangers, checkin' their own boys
Instigations made by certain hoes
Got a player hatin' on the down low
So I keeps my mind in the motherfucking greatest type of condition
To avoid being missin'
Wishin' that the money would help me forget about all the chances
But certain chances led to other circumstances
Ridin' in the streets, 4 deep after midnight
Packin' the heat that's how we creep to keep the shit tight
But know the IRS know my name, I can't buy a damn thang
So tell me, what can I do to get out the game

What can I do?
What can I do to get out the game, get out the game
What can I do to get out the game

Today is a new day, oh what a lovely day
I'm gonna try a new way to make my brain power pay
Scope the tight spot to open up a night spot
Supposed to meet the man about the lease on the lot
Got half way up out the house, when what do you know
Somebody wanted me to re open the drug store
Now would it be different if I would jugglin' on the light side
I would go meet the man and let that dope shit slide
But every time a nigga come with a bigger figure
I gotta dash home and get my fuckin' serve on
Makin' fast money, hook me like nicotine
This on the street shit is deeper than a submarine
One day I want to have a wife and live twice as nice
Afraid I'm gonna lose my life before I get it right
Stuck like glue in this underground life click
My hard headedness got me in some stupid shit

I thought it was safe to put the house in my momma name
'Till I was busted  and all the fucked up drama came
I coulda sold my whole soul to the devil
To be smackin' the FED's across the head
With a shovel I was hauled away
A sunny day on my streets
Shackle the cuff with no shoes on my feet
They slammin' down face first on the brick
And looked at my daddy, like boy you betta say not shit
Now ain't that bitch, a real motherfucking fag
Wanna be hard and hide behind a rusty ass badge
Embarassed as fuck, my own kids have to watch
While daddy was beaten and being drugged by a cop
And now that the bubble had been busted in my shit
They looked at my family like we was all unlegit
The block was shocked, because my folks was so nice
But the spot was hot, because they son led a street life

What can I do?
What can I do to get out the game, get out the game
What can I do to get out the game",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-what-can-i-do-lyrics

More bullets, more quicker than the whole crowd saw me pull it
Cap 'em high, watch me shake 'em low, 'cause I think 'em go crazy
Screaming, ""pay me,"" that nigga lazy

Too much and, mister cuphand, now he reaching
Sneaking, constantly peeping, looking for pickin's

Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all

When the shit jumps off, what you gonna do?

Here it is, once again - it's 8Bizzal
Flipping the funky flavor with a pause
Dog, what you say? Nigga, what?
You mad 'cause I boned and broke your little slut?
Fool, what you expect?
I really hope a, sucker get in the range of my scope'a
I told ya, that I would blow your ass all the way
Skippety-bop with my Glock like Cab Calloway
Smiling, profiling, teeth glistening
Talking like I'm whispering 'cause everybody's listening
Mentioning how I'm venturing into Michigan
Third under my belt, and it's still Suave clique again
Hear me, nigga, fear me - don't come near me
Santa, with anna dropping bombs down your chimney
Fatter, Tec gripper, chest mangler
Send a nigga six feet in a box rectangular

They call me M-J fuckin' G, I
Looked for the tree, high since I was knee-high
I rampage a room full of bitches, fuck a rest have'
Lest they's be lickin' testy's, while they rest they's
Chin on my inner thigh and, really try and
Proceed to kinda feel to need to make a nigga believe you
And did you, suck a bandit dick, and bitch, it's still to feed you
I read through, that motherfuckin', shit stuck and
My past shit sent to ruin, ain't true and
You and your whole agenda must surrender
Remember, I strike so hard I knock you down like timber
Relaxing, continue stacking multiple ends
And looking to find a way to flip my dividends again
Mr. Mackin, pistol packin', straight jackin'
The shit out of a nigga's anus, make him famous
Done paid for it last night and, too many fighting
Resulted to a wig splitting, he died shitting

Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all
Fuck it up y'all, fuck it up y'all

Hand of the Devil,On Top Of The World,1995,"Hid behind the garbage can, waited for the manager
He looked kind of shady, I don't think that he can handle a…
Nigga that's ready to pull a TEC-9 in his left arm
If he steps on, he gon' really do himself harm
Keepin' calm, snatch the cheese from his hand
Thinkin' about a getaway route, I jacked him for a van
Jumped into the thang, slammed the door, hit the gas
Now I get this feelin' someone's lookin' at my ass
Looked into the rear, it was his prejudice-ass wife…
Balled up on the seats cryin', ""Please don't take my life""
I grabbed her by her hair – ""Hush, bitch, don't speak""
And doin' about 110, then released her into the streets
I'm pushin' a van, I made my move toward Motel 6…
To rob a trick who had got himself hooked up with a bitch…
Who had only one intention – to pinch him, was bein' paid
The bitch went down with 

The buster was gettin' played
My mind started thinkin' the bitch is only for gankin'
The shit started stankin' as soon as I started drankin'
The first spirit told me to pay her and let her go
The devil told me, ""How in the fuck can you trust a ho?""
My hands started shakin' and mentally, I was breakin'
My hunger for the thrill of a kill begun achin'
I'm takin' all the money, proceedin' to bust a rapin'
Swiss army knife tight on the wrist and I started tapin'…
Her mouth up, pullin' the couch up and 

A knife held to her neck through the back of the seat cushion
I'm takin' the loot, then breakin' her loose from the scenery
Checkin' my tracks, constantly watchin' my back
What does it mean to be…
Totally paranoid, thinkin' my past gonna catch up with my ass?
Livin' my life so fast, people wonderin' how do I usually last
Don't question me unless you down on my level…
So you can understand about the…

Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil

Clappin' in my undercover bucket, chiefin hay
Thinkin' about the fat liquor nigga hit for yesterday
Now, finally the horrors of my hustle will not haunt me
No more will I have to jack these niggas…
And leave them bodies in the street
Driftin' to another place, halfway through my blunt
A whole Ninquén and a fifth of gin to get shit crunk
No dirt on my mind until I seen him
$100,000 Benz with gold-tone rims
I said no more will I ever take another man's shit…
Until I seen that Rolex when he hit that cigarette
Instinctively, I start to follow him and make my scheme
At the same time, wonderin' why do I do these things
Could there be a force stronger than our ones we know?
Unconsciously controllin' things we do and how shit go
Now I'm reachin' for my Glock, my only tooler
Hopin' this time I don't even have to use her
At the same time, this nigga felt like eatin' Taco Bell
At the same time, he did not know he 'bout to catch hell
Pulled up on the lot a bit fast, I'm a little anxious
Ready to get my serve on like a motherfuckin' waitress
He must've noticed me, then balled out the lot fast
But I can't let him pass with them out-of-state tags
I hit the gas to the floor and made them dogs holler
Tinted windows hidin' me inside my '78 Impala
Now I'm twisted, angry, blood boilin' like some coffee
Hearin' voices that go, ""Let him go and don't be foolish""
But there's a louder voice drownin' out my good intentions…
Screamin', yellin', forcin' me to complete my mission
Listen, temptation put me in this situation
But somethin' good is the reason for my hesitation
In the end, I took his car, his jewels and his life
The devil made me do it

Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it
Hands of the devil
He made me do it, do it",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-hand-of-the-devil-lyrics
Break ’Em Off,On Top Of The World,1995,"I've come to break you off proper
Swish swasher through the washer
On fire, 360 degrees around the dryer
I'm tighter, the vicegrippers cut you like clippers
Your game plan loose as house slippers, how you figure?
Your small heart with your big nuts got you pumped up
You fucked up when you bucked up, you out of luck, duck
You ain't my best friend, you's another foe
And bitch you ain't my main thing, you that other hoe
So, let me flip the script, hit the clip
Pop it in, take a trip straight through reality
Cause you don't know the half of the
Shit that I could do to you or what I'm going to
Play me up too close and I'll be showing you
Knowing you really can't hang with my flavor
But you wants to approach me with misbehavior
I gots my ammo, my gun – we can run, we can fight
I could end your life tonight or we could do this shit right
I ain't wrong, I'm kickin' it back on the phone with Mrs. Jones
She lets me know the time when her husband leaves home
Well it's on, I know he pays the cost to be the boss
But if he makes it home early, I'ma have to break him off

Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper

Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper

All respects to the west, big ups to the east
Southside represent, blowing up like yeast
On these techniques I speak, in each flow
Broke 'em off something proper when I stepped through the door
Give me the mic so I can hype this shit
Cold blooded like a snake, so you better watch your bitch
I admit, no nigga can't fade
Kill 'em, kill 'em dead, like Raid
Fetch her, stretch her, then bring me some competition
Listen to my hallucinated mental vision
Smoke a fat sack, we see distant feedback
Then commence to attack, T-Mix track
Leave a trail of broke mics and lovesick hoes
Thick hoes who want dick after every show
But I'm a real nigga, break a bitch college scholar
MJ fucking G, break 'em off something proper

I bust through steel like it's plastic
Strangle your ass to death with elastics
Trunk your damn body in a basket and drag it
Damn to the motherfucking river, to give a
Fish a good meal from a  type kill
It's the man with his hand on the gun
Sun beaming straight down on my chrome
Dome all in the way of my infrared
Motherfucking dot on your hard ass head
You're scared, I know you don't really want to show it
You bluffed for too long, now you don't want to blow it
I know it's hard, even concrete crumbles
Buts that's the way you came, that's the way you gotta go
There'll be no trick busta, double crosses
Call me the  in the 
MJG has now spoken
Your under-minded strategy is broken, stop hoping

Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper
Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper
Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper
Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper

It's that nigga from the southside – 8Ball
Much game, true hustler, mack as long as the gray wall
Tennessee – Memphis, Tennessee precisely
Southern brothers gotta break yo' ass off politely
Fuck a zag, I need a blunt from my bag
Cut 'em, fill 'em, stick 'em, take a drag
 – 
then go 
At a marshmallow fellow – tried to check
In a sec, turned to O.J. and cut a nigga neck
But back to reality, actually
The fact would be naturally
It's hard for MC's to see me
Concrete, like the street under my feet
Spittin' space age pimpin' over hyped beats
White sheets and ink record what I think
Chief and hay getting blinked 'til my eyes turn pink
Gangsta Gangsta like Cube and Eazy-E
This the wild west, nigga – strapped is the way to be
911 ain't quicker than my 
So you better not forget your vest
It costs to be the boss in the land of the lost
Sucker free, properly breaking niggas off

Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper

What Do You See,On Top Of The World,1995,"I gots no muthafuckin’ ends, sit and wish for a riot
Knowing it’s too damn hot outside, plus I’m tired
My income is hurtin’ and then some, why can’t lend some
G’s to a brother making his come up undercover
These hoes, they want new clothes, to ride on Vogues
And most of the time they be getting chose when they pose
Ain’t no victory in doing shit for the next bitch of the century
Can’t do shit for me but an injury
I be the pimp master, outlaster
Outblaster, 30 bustas with the outcaster
Hit the masker, don’t ask a
The identities of the fallen enemies, nigga, please

Heart of a hustler, real, done by no bloodstains
Take it how you wanna take it while I break it down, mayne
Crews come in twos and threes but they all fold
Enemies of me and MJG’s tight flow
Hoes jockin’, tryna slip into a nigga pocket
Get in the hotel room naked then scream “Stop it!”
Listen, I’m gonna take it to another level
All you need to do is suck me clean like a Dirt Devil
Shovel-packin’ bitches wasting my precious time
Pussy creamin’, simultaneously schemin’
What do you see when you see me? I’ll tell you what
A true player from the South in the house
(“Do you wanna see…”) *scratching*

When it comes to getting rugged, this bitch is wicked
Style like none other, this bitch can kick it
Southernplayalistic bitch with the meal ticket
Slamming like Hakeem when it comes to this rap thang
Tomboy-ish ass flow, so now you know
Lez Moné been kickin’ shit since ‘84
‘Cause it’s a big deal like Poppa, my shit is proper
And tucked inside the boots, I got my shit-stopper
Bitches recognize, haters realize
Suave House shit is thick, sit back and catch some of this pimp shit
As we dips through your muthafuckin’ hood
The shit is understood, give up your goods
Eight, tell ‘em what you see when they go fuckin’ with the crew

We on top of the world, bitch, I thought you knew
What they know about them Nuckleheadz?
Madam, break it down for me one time

Ha, all I wanna do is be fly, toss niggas and stack mail
But in the meantime, I gotta post bail
My so-called homies began to realize
The quality up in this G bitch nationwide
When I see you, prepare for this player to put the stare on ya
Telephone ya? I thinks not
So what you know about that Suave House?
Oh, we cold like teddy, about to turn the fuckin’ lights out
So let’s turn some corners up on that Northside
Southside, it sound good up in that D ride
And if I was a nigga, I’d be on my own dick
Just like a trick or a gold-diggin’ bitch
Swing low sweet chariot, off in the Marriott Hotel
But oh well, madam macks
Well, hittin’ harder than Vernon
Ask that L-E-Z what this bitch be earnin’

It’s me, original player, OP
Stout woman undresser, professor, hoe tester, inc
Smoking, from the cess to the chronic
Throw away your papers, real niggas get blunted
Silk tailor-made, black as a spade with braids
Gator shoes, making money hungry hoes choose
Gold smile, tongue flowing like the Mississippi
Lyric constructor, smoked out like Chris Tucker
What the—busta musta didn’t pay attention
Hit rewind and let me take your mind back in time
Remember me, little, fat, cute, and chubby?
Now I’m mean muggin’ niggas, walking ‘round shoving niggas
When I open up my mouth, you can hear the South
Packin’ guns, stackin’ funds, fuck selling out
When you see me, what do you really see?
Screaming like Mike and Janet, but you don’t hear me

Never no more than the P-I-M-P-I-N-G since the day
That I stood in the hood, I would be strictly down for my dollar
Break a bitch scholar
Hoe, give me my cheese ‘fore I snatch you by your collar
Better not holler
It’s the nigga with his dick in your throat
Better not tell a lie ‘cause your ass might choke
I’m smoking plenty bud, drinking ‘gnac and riding candy
Shit to make a bullshit day feel dandy
What do you do when you see straight through a nigga’s game?
Do you hang point blank range to his brain?
Will he have a life after death? I don’t know
He push me like a hoe, he gotta go, he gotta go
Note the flow when the gun smoke clears, it be history
Call Captain Kirk for the unsolved mystery, quickly
Tell a muh’fucka what you see
Fading out this world peeping up at MJG

Comin’ Up,On Top Of The World,1995,"A hot day in August, 1991
Me and MJ walkin', talkin' in the hot sun
OTS was home then, Listen To The Lyrics
Me and MJ made the shit
101 played the shit
Sellin' tapes straight from my hand to your hand
Pump didn't give us none
So we had to take them
Make him respect a nigga, check the nigga constantly
Busta, where my cheese at?
Before I have to get the gat
Every record store and stereo supply shop
Sellin' me, but I'm not collectin' a salary
What else to do except say fuck this whole rap shit
Find a hustle in the streets and try to flip shit
All in the next nigga hood slangin' packs on the bus
People askin' me, ""Mane, don't you rap?""
No shame, had to get to A to B to make the C-H-Double-E-S-E
Comin' up

1992, stackin' dues, not royalties
Cause we was told they was used for utilities
Not one single dime, not one check
And we was here from the whole business aspect
A lot of fame came with some decent record sales
But at the same time, we was catchin' plenty hell
Cause we could tell that the record deal was goin' sour
But over everything we did, he had full power
With no money in my hands, only fans
Stayin' true, takin' stance helped me to pursue my fans
Pen and paper
I kept keepin'
Reefer chiefin'
Beepers wasn't beepin'
Money we was needin'
Me and 'Ball constantly havin' arguments with our manager
Tryin' to damage a
Good career, fool, is amateur
Damn it's a, cryin' shame
To take too much
8Ball & MJG broke free
For the come up

9:30 in the morning, me and MJ on the phone
8 o'clock the same day, we was outta here and gone
T-Money and JB set the tickets up, we picked 'em up
Hit the studio, ready to make the megabucks
Seein' kis and Gs, and hangin' with the hustlers
Real niggas with Glocks, eliminatin' bustas
In the process, we made Comin’ Out Hard
That’s when my real nigga J went behind bars
Every day flyin’ state to state, the shit was great
Eatin’ steak and lobster like motherfuckin’ mobsters
Mettin’ women that I’ll probably never meet again
Smilin’ faces, on the outside, looking’ in

I’m on the outside, lookin’ in
I coulda been another one take
Mystery that went with history, just like a trend
Then, I would lose all hope, if I don’t shout
But it’s too many players in my motherfuckin’ court
Prepare to blow the fuck outta the rap game
Cause we ain’t, droppin’ vocals soundin’ like the next mane
Watchin’ out for new friends, hangin’ out with true friends
Splurgin’ with some loose ends, ridin' in a new Benz
1995, pure dope, uncut, super nuts
Much hard from the start, from the hips, out the gut
Much skills, I’ma flex on the next tape
Showin' off, ain't no way in hell I’ma fail
While I’m comin' up",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-comin-up-lyrics

Putting out a hit on all player haters, faux creators, bitch chasers
Suave House, MJG & 8Ball are most definetely in the motherfucking house
Parting all this shit like a comma
So call your mama for the drama
Can't gets none
If you want some
You can't take none
Can't make none
Straight out of 
Memphis, Tenessee
Houston, Texas
Riding in the mix

Lay it down, niggas

Take'em off, bitches",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-intro-on-top-of-the-world-lyrics
Reason For Rhyme,Rhyme & Reason (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),1997,"I'm MJG, the nigga with the versatile style
Check your calendar realize that I been here for awhile
When I was young I took the soul up out of rhythm and blues
When hip hop originated slowly paid my dues
And take my shoes, and try to walk a mile in my past
Without them salt shaker sheisters tryin to get in that ass
It's been too long, you motherfuckers fittin to feel the south
Shut your mouth, shut your do you little freak ass ho
I'm bout tired of all this damn east and west coast shit
Especially when other niggas tryin to work in this bitch
I paid my dues to the fullest, worked to god damn hard
For you too kill the industry and leave me out of a job
You niggas strain yourself, to maintain yourself
And now you playin with enough rope to actually hang yourself
But you don't care, hell, you constantly fallin deep in the plot
Mesmerized from all the bitches and the money you got
You must of forgot they said that rap would never last ten years
And if your selfish to the fact, I'm tryin to have a career
Now listen here, what do we have, we got probable cause
To keep the pen on the paper and the Glock in your drawers, nigga

Remember back when we used to do this shit for fun
Bein the dopest on my block made me ranked number one
No gun, just a pen and notebook paper by the sheet
In the crib, gettin funky off the next nigga beat
No electronics to make the shit that I wrote the chronic
Shit sick enough to bring vomit from your stomach
Quick as a comet, shield your eyes from the UV
Groovey, like a nigga from a Batman movie
Real about the shit that I express over dope beats
You can't say it was fake unless you grew up on my street
Concrete head niggas, runnin from FED niggas
Po' ass scared niggas, that came out dead niggas
And all I ever wanted to be was an emcee
Did a little dirt and found it wasn't for me
Poetry flowin through my bloodstream like a drug
I'm addicted to rhyme because I love the buzz, nigga

My reason for rhyme
Because I'm true to this rap
My reason for rhyme
Because I'm real with this rap
My reason for rhyme
It ain't all about the cheese
Even though fat lp's can make a nigga g's

My reason for rhymin, while I'm in, a position to be tellin
It's not about the fame and them bitches who be yellin
At my concerts, one verse, dicks up, quick fuck
Lies start spreadin now you tangled in a mix up
I gits up, do sits up, and squeeze my mental mindrame back in order
And use my hand as a tape recorder
Jottin down all the information placed in front of me
The good time, the bad time, the way I think it oughta be
Now follow G, can you comprehend?
If you can then drink a shot of Hen
Hit this hand on your silver end
Friends don't be friends and foes don't be foes
However the way you bring it, that's how you want it, I suppose
I can stay up out the game keep my aim on my paper
And I'll be sure to keep my pimpin real with Tony Draper
And I'll potray the man that I'm known to be
Dim the lights (Hip-tie) for the MJG


Give me a crowd of wild niggas who love real hip hop
And watched smoke get soaked up, like water in a mop
Drop presidents among me and my own folk
And let that bullshit walk among the past with ghosts
Ain't no hope of bein takin seriously
When limited avenues are given to me
So, naturally I take shit and make shit mine
Jackin only for position in this thing called rhyme
Freestyle, not great, but if you wait for a second
I could write some shit down that could get a gold record
Thought about not the first thing that I think about
MJG and Eightball and hard is how we comin out
Runnin out, niggas who can't hold on like En Vogue
Even though I moved out the mound I'm still ten toed
Down for the shit I do, the Suave House crew
True to this shit, because this shit is so true

End with shoutouts",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-reason-for-rhyme-lyrics

Cook heat over beats so I'm somethin' like a chef
Purple kushes, my bitches wax off they pussy bushes
Eat dick like it's delicious, and grant a pimp wishes
She dig my country talkin', she say I sound funny
Embassy suites sittin' on the bed countin' money
Illegal hustlin', dirty money mostly
Spend it like I never saw a day of pain or sufferin'
Look at my face you can tell I seen both of 'em
I stick 'n' move, do my biz, get the dough and dip
My chronic habit, heavy weed, man, in every city
My money big so my airplane's lil bitty
Major visibility, bad boy lieutenant
Black Phantom with the black guts and I'm in it


Fuck it! Ima blast off, take my mask off
Blow your fuckin' ass off, give me the cash, 'cause
M-J-G not playin' no games
If you not speakin' good, don't be sayin' my name

Ima track you down and pull a muthafuckin' rape-aroo
Ain't no way you niggas can hide
I can get you in the house, I can get you outside
Ima load the pump up, lay down, jump up
Surprise, everybody finna help me with my come-up
Damn, I done made all of y'all shit yer jeans
This look like it might be a job for Mr. Clean
Ole bootleg nigga, you's a knock-off, an imitation
Local-ass kingpin nigga with a limitation
You don't want no drama with me
’Cause I got the ghost of Jeffrey Dahmer with me


Suckas wanna see me fall, fall like a ton of bricks
It'll never happen, dawg, Project Pat'll play it slick
Flick when I'm in the ride, nine-million homicide
Done when ya come wrong, shoot suckas in the dome
Always about the cheese, didn't wanna go there
He don't wanna pay me, where he stay let's roll there
What's crooked as a 
crooked letter, humpback, humpback
Soda cook the dope together, jump back, jump back
Meet any weather cock, it pump back, pump back
If ya bust it first, Ima dump back, dump back
Down South we gon' hustle to the rooster crow
My nose runnin' still 'cause a nigga used to blow
If pockets low I'll let ya know (don't turn around)
A hair-trigger that'll bust (don't make a sound)
Ima tell ya what to do (lay it on the ground)

Cruizin,Ridin High,2007,"(Intro, Eightball)
Eightball and MJG
Three 6 Mafia, and 112
We finna take this thang to another level
Ya hear me?
All the ladies come to the front
All the haters, get out the building
Yeah
(Hook, 112)
Laid back in the 'Lac
Grippin the grain, as I'm cruisin the streets (Cruisin the streets girl)
It's 1:12 on the dot, you're on the phone talkin' dirty to me
Talkin' dirty to me
I wanna know, do you really wanna go
Cause I'm sittin in front of your condo
Other niggas playin' around, believe me, I'm the one though
So baby take ya clothes off and bring ya body next to me
(Verse 1, MJG)
Now how long will it take a nigga like MJG
To get a girl back to the hotel
I'ma stop and get some rubbers and some Cigarillos
You can meet me, I'mma be in room 112
Cause I did enough talkin on the telephone
Right now I'm really tryin'a put my hands on it
So if you any kinda way
You can come through, I know you didn't really plan on it
Although I gotta come and pick you up, show you off
Ride to the hot-spot
But don't try'ta act special, when you ridin in my drop-top
Listen what I need you to do is, hold this bag while I break this blunt down
We gon' have to park in a minute
Cause the cops get hot right around by sun-down
I like it how you wear them jeans
Tight fittin motherfucka, right with the low-rise
M-J, G finna sprinkle in somethin super incredible
Bitch I'm so fly
I got my hand on the woodgrain
I'm in a Cadillac feelin like a ""Space-Age Pimp"", mayn
And even if you try hard as hell
You never do it like I did it
It's a motherfuckin pimp thang
(Hook)
(Verse 2, Eightball)
Can I get'chu to, come here girl
Let me say some sweet in ya ear girl
I see ya movin ya butt to the beat girl
Wanna dip? Then come see my world
Big-Ball the one with the extra keys to the condo up-town
You can come through when ya want to
That's how me a lil ma get down
Sometimes we hit the town
With the radio up, and the windows down
Get a suite at the W, get a bag of bush and just smoke it out
And I don't expect every motherfucka in here to know what I'm talkin bout
These niggas ain't got no game
A lotta these niggas just talkin loud
And I, know I'm not the best lookin nigga
But I'm, so far from the worst lookin nigga
When it come to the Dirty, me and my nigga
We was one of the first in the picture
Three strikes on my feet
For my nigga J, MJ, put'cha peace sign in the air
Wanna go to a place where they don't hate?
Listen to ya boy, let me take you there
(Hook)
(Verse 3, Crunchy Black)
I like it when ya call my name
I like it when we play that game
What game is that, girl?
That freaky-deeky game
It ain't no shame when I bang
Go ahead and grab that thang
That grown man thang
Stop gigglin playin mayn
Do you know what I'm sayin mayn?
See you's a freaky dame
Can I call up couple of my friends?
So we can run a train?
And I'm sayin I think I can
I'm bangin her out the frame
Doin that big-boy dance
With my hands on my side, mayn
(Verse 4, Juicy J)
I'mma D boy from the hood (Yeah!)
Smokin on a big bag of kush (Yeah!)
Workin all day in a trap-house (Yeah!)
See the police, then we push (Yeah!)
And when a playa ride through the street (Yeah!)
I'm always lookin for a freak (Yeah!)
They call me the Juice Man gigolo (Yeah!)
Take it out, skeet-skeet-skeet (Yeah!)
(Verse 5, DJ Paul)
I hit her up on Blackberry
She see the e-mail from daddy
She know it's time to shake her man
And meet me at the ho-telly
See he a old head, with some mo' bread, Keep her fed
But I'm the one she call, when she need that ass tapped

Now i be sittin in the front row right before come out of the back room waitin for a strip tease
Can I get me a table dance without all the attitude and the lip please
Can we go into the V.I.P of the V.I.P in the back of the back room
Baby you can come with something creative that gonna make me wanna hurry up and try to come back soon

Try'na make a fat knock
Swell in my pocket
Like I'm carryin' a loaf of bread
Been around the world
But I still love local head
Got the shit to make 'em jump
It's hyper like a pimp rally
Give 'em just a piece it make 'em
Mime me like a skip daddy
Glock, Chevy parked in the yard
Wit' the double pipes
If I catch ya try'na steal it
I'ma get double life
I ain't wanna do it, I ain't even really hate son
That's a damn shame but tomorrow, I'ma make ???

Comin' for the boys who thought that I wouldn't bail out

Broads wit' them credit cards

Flat TVs and some tiles for my momma car
Eighty-thousand dollars, I'mma fuckin' ghetto superstar
Work come soft, never hard, that's a different charge
Tre-8 never jam if I gotta blam blam!

Plenty plastic wrap and a vacuum pack machine

Green-sticky that'll keep a buffalo chokin
Come and go with me, creep off in my Chevy thang
Doin 45, twistin somethin steady mayn
Headed to my low-key, safe-and-sound house
Call up the fellas, hit the spot, and pull a pound out
I used to have a secret spot up in my Range Rover
Where I kept me somethin rolled, I'mma chain smoker
No discrimination my nigga, if you broke
But they still ain't attributed to good smoke
B.Y.O.B, bring ya own bud
Contribute to the pot, or do ya own drugs
But then I looked around and noticed all the folks was gone
I shoulda known that they would leave when all the smoke was gone

Man, my weed is smoked up
Man, my weed is smoked up

Wake up, before I wash the crust up out my eyes
I'm splittin a cigarillo, fiendin for my morning high
Break that sticky down, roll it up, let it dry
Strike my lighter, put it to the tip, then I
Inhale, and let the smoke smoke fill up in my lungs
Hold it for a second, blow it out and get numb
A drug-addict, I'm a junkie for that Marijuana
No mid-grade, or no regular, just straight chronic
At least four-hundred, for a zip, if I'mma touch it
See I'mma smoke it if I like it, I ain't got no budget
Now mama with me, wanna hit, better take it slow
Seen it befo', I'mma be gettin this bitch up off the flo'
Burn it all til' the whole bag empty
Now err'body gone, ain't nobody here but me

Flyin in that G-4
Goin to do them foreign shows
Givin 'em my foreign clothes
Fuckin with them foreign hoes

Burnin grams of that kush

Now I'm drinkin vinegar
Scared as hell my P.O. gon' pull me and make me piss in cups

But it ain't the situation here cause I ain't seen that
My background messed up, I ain't a clean cat
But I fucks with you shorty, I really mean that
Holla at the homie if you ready to change
Your lifestyle
Cause I'm livin in a differ-ent game (Off top)

I spit flows
Like a pimp pimps hoes
32 o's and ain't none for my nose
The pinky and the wrist and the neck stay froze
The chest keep comin and I'm livin on a roll
I meet a bunch of women (Ya)
I meet a bunch of hoes (Ya)
I gotta bunch of friends (Ya)
I gotta bunch of foes (Ya)
Good nigga, hood nigga
Walk and talk real slow
Outside fat black, but the inside glow
Shorty don't choose
She the one gon' lose
Good girls beware, Fat Boy bad news
Cars and cribs and clothes and jewels
Mama say she love Big Boy, this one here for you (O!)",https://genius.com/8ball-and-mjg-pimpin-dont-fail-me-now-lyrics

They shoot (They shoot), they shoot (They shoot)

What's the worse shit heard
A shotgun blast from the back of your head
Niggas don't know who got hit
But I know for sho somebody dead
All I hear is people scream in the background
Everybody in the club down on the floor
Everybody in the VIP was
Runnin' over each other for the back door
I don't see MJG nowhere
Gunshots still pop in the mayhem
I'ma reach for the heat that I snuck in
Hope my shots don't hit the innocent
Seems like we done been here a long time
But it's only been about 5 minutes
Shoulda stayed my ass at home
It's too late now, I'm already in it
Whats the worse shit seen?
Blood on the floor, blood on the wall
People gettin' hit didn't do nothing
Baby don't know why I ain't comin' home
And I don't know what started it all
Over some bread or over some broad
A nigga done went too far
Now you gotta run and deal wit the law
And I don't wanna do nothin' but get home
I don't wanna see nothin' but the freeway
I don't wanna have to pop this 4-5
But I will if it mean I'ma get away
Pull back let it all go
Run outside, jump in the vee-hic
Burn off doin' 84
Nigga wanna get me, boy better be quick

Yeah, witnesses runnin', talkin' 'bout the shooters is comin'
I'm jumpin' over the one that says I get low
Niggas comin' outta nowhere with all sorts of shit that make me wonder how they got it through the front door
Security beatin' the hell outta some of the instigators
Who started the fuckin' ruckus in the first place
And it ain't even no way I could sugarcoat it
As bad is I want the shit to be over and be the worse case
Of a nigga tryna get out of the middle of a situation when the situation gotta get down
I'm tryin' to make it to my Chevy
I don't give a fuck about the bitches or the little money I done spent now
MJG I be the realest but right now my nigga I'm just tryna get up out the club like
So don't be stickin' your hand out to me talkin' 'bout you hurtin'
You a veteran and hit me with a dub spot
It ain't no way I'm tryna get hit with a stray bullet
But no matter what you say, nigga, they pull it
Out with the quickness 'cause it's real in the field
Little rookie, you don't know, you better muthafuckin' stay fullest
A nigga who on a mission to get me and everybody
Who came with me back to muthafuckin' safety
And don't nobody but me and a couple niggas who kill nigga for real really don't wanna play me
Hit the ignition on the Chevy Impala
To keep the lookers on me I just cut the music on the lo-lo
I got my hand on the fo'-fo'
Tellin' my people to get down, help me look out for the po-po
Put it in drive, hit the accelerator, it's no more waitin'
Gotta get pistol grippin' while I'm dippin' now
Another episode of niggas tryna get out the club
Because some other muthafuckin' nigga trippin' now

(Eightball)
Big plush cadillac seats holding me up
Bitches hatin' cuz I'm always doing big boy stuff
Wood wheel ill be grippin' in my big boy truck
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked
Eightball, MJG you know we can't be touched
If its bout Hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' I'm a cock it and bust
And MJG gon be right with me if that eight ain't enough
(MJG)
If Eight ain't enough
Don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks
And eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well some more shit I'm stuck up in
Hey, let's squash it
Go sweep the dust up then
Drink a shot
I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in
MJG pimp tight! And I got em
Chorus: 8X
(Eightball)
We handle this shit like a pimp should
I fuck with them niggas who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin on that shit that gon be burnin' in yo chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggas want a bitch you got that 
fye
 head
And all I want is weed and money
And mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money
(MJG)
Ya poor dummy
You should be spendin ya ho money
When she offered you some
You probably tell her ""no honey""
You to slow sonny
What I'm spittin' gon make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking
You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos
Built blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me
I see some dough coming
My main focus is tricks who be out 
ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'
Chorus: 8X
(Eightball)
I like them yellow thick women giving love to me
Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches cuz of me
Always wanna sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Ok we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya ima get me some
(MJG)
Hit a lick or 
some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blister some
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin'
I'm the official one
MJG I pimp strong until the reasons gone
Until it ain't no hoe track left to sprinkle season on
The niggas who violated they still bleedin' on
I-V packs and shit sacks and the leavings on

Historic hits, nigga like Ali's fist
Rock the world
Get freaked by a different bunch hot little girls
Speed it up, and let a real nigga see what ya got lil' girl
Got a lil' dough, got something to blow
You wanna get like that, gimmie head in the Benz, I love a chick that suck dick like that
Dirty, southern gritty

Chopin', collar poppin', platinum droppin'

Hittin' licks, shawty me and my niggas so official with it
Poetic pimpin', ain't no playin' when we step up in it

Futuristic, what you need to do is catch up with us

Bounce, Bounce
Man get up on you feet and help me get it
Crunk, Crunk
Everybody up in here let me see ya

If a nigga trippin we gone make them heaters

Dime pieces let me see you make that ass

I'm a kill with the mic
Before I get buck with the gun
1-9-7-2 was the birth
Tell a nigga was the worst
You can't fuck with the one
Nigga take ya foot out ya mouth
Get ya ass off the couch
MJG bringin' the heat when Quik droppin' this beat
I know they call it rap, but I'mma rock this beat
Breakin 'em off with dope seeds
The nigga with the most of this
Coast to coast to hit
Roll the shit, Broke the shit
Kept smokin'
Then put it down on tape again
I got a fifth of Hen
Fifth of Gin
A fifth for now
And a fifth for then
Takin my time
Take it down shot for shot
You ain't got Con-gac it's not the spine
I got a stack of hoes
Matter a fact a nigga smackin' hoes
Straight up mack them hoes
If you a platinum ho, You gotta keep workin' the bitch
Don't stop and relax them hoes
A lot of niggas be claimin' to pimp
And a whole lot of pimpin' what a nigga be talkin' about
But when a bitch tell a nigga to spend some money
The mothafuckas still be walkin 'em out
Takin 'em home, givin 'em cheese, beggin 'em please
Talkin' about he'll take my ki's, big trick
See I was born to pimp for this shit
MJG equipped for this shit
Ain't no niggas in here found time
Fake ass niggas is scared of my rhyme
Pimp tight, break a bitch quick
Futuristic niggas take shit


P-I-M-P unified, MJG and Q gone try
See me gettin' down with Ball in the lopes with a bomb full of smoke
Rappin' niggas ain't no joke
So me to the front of the boards
With an MP and piano chords
Gettin' back to my evil ways
Lick him 3 times, he gone pay
Sidetrack, forgot your point
It's a 10 to 4 bet that you ain't gonna forget that
Get your peeps up off my cheese
Put your money in the pot, go squeeze
See the bright red dice just die
Shoot a whole meal, I might just try
18 thou with the jewelry on the floor
When I hit a lick don't flex no more
Gamblin', scramblin' tryin' to get up out the hood
Nothin' but scavengers and the bettin' ain't good
Show me where it's sunny at, where it's funny at
Hoes with the polished toes, I'm a money cat
Tip toe blow walkin' on a rift raft
Put that shit back in ya pocket I don't sniff that
I'm lookin' for the bud, and the brew
And some X with a broad with some thug in her jewels
(Got Sex) 6 uniforms all on my back
I was gone chill to, they didn't peep that
Had to be something else to make them irate
Give a nigga a minute let me clean the slate
No, I ain't have sex with ya wife
No, I ain't make threats on ya life

Pimp Shit,Space Age 4 Eva,2000,"You can count on this pimpin', I got them Budweiser horse women
Black mack, make a rookie divorce pimpin'
I didn't read about it, I was born with it and exercised
First I came with a game plan (what) next I tried it
Now what you know about that money in her snatch
When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em
Cause ain't no hoe supposed to have no emotions
Her job is to keep a trick broken and hopeless
 - X 2
This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

I bust nuts on the face of slut hoes
And hang at the club with dope dealers and cutthroats
Never been one of them niggas that would save a hoe
Bitch you know the score, you can get your shit and hit the door
Never slippin', you trippin' if you think you pimpin'
Hoes comin' up if they in front of you strippin'
Trickin', that pussy wet lookin' finger lickin'
Tradin' big faces hopin' you can stick your dick in
And she will do whatever for a dollar bill
Suck dick and lick clit on them X pills
High heels and big thighs make a dick ride
Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it
I got the pie, you got to work if you want some of this
Where you from bitch, don't nothin' come easily
I got somethin' for you if you got somethin' for me

This is pimp shit, you hoes got to deal with
No nonsense, bitch, that's what this is
Pimp shit, you hoes gon' respect this
Real nigga shit and ain't scared to check a bitch

For four and a quarter you can get a hoe and a order
A Barbie doll bitch or a hoe from across the border
A loose bitch, a tight bitch, whatever you like
With the certain group of paint brushin' bitches consider priceless
Nut drinkers, butt spankers, dominatrix
Most ain't really with that rough shit but some can take it
One hundred percent born and bred, pimp type
Hoes make my money off of goin' to bed

Givin' head, hookin' niggas like a cigarette
Niggas plea and pay fees, just to get a hit
Skin tight, with no hair so you can see the clit
White hoes, black hoes and hoes that Hispanic
Pierced tongue feel good when she workin' wood
Platinum Visa, PIN numbers and them check books
Turn it in, help a nigga get a new Benz
Turn out your friend, let me be both of y'all man

Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme
 2x
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I wanna be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho wanna kick it
Get down lick it, cuz I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy
 2x

She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

 4x
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

Can't even do this right here man
But you know how we do
Hold it down, get it right, keep it tight
And most of all..
We thank God

For my three sons, for my mom
For waking me up and breathing air into my lungs
For health and wealth and lots of love for myself
The chances in life to take the right steps
I done popped that thang, and I done been popped at
Stole, cheated, and lied
Survived when I could have died
Or somewhere locked up, my niggas locked up
That's why I pray to you, say what I say to you
Thank you for Swizz Beatz, to him you bring the heat
He brought the heat to us, we burn the streets up
Thank you for family and everyone that stuck with us
Gettin it crunk, and layin it down, and gettin to buck with us
Thank you for not lettin material things make me
Thank you for givin me the talent that my peoples see
Thank you for lettin my niggas live after gunplay
Thanks for forgiving me, cause I don't do this every day

 I thank God!
 For lettin me make it out the club
That night all that fightin and shootin jumped off
 We thank God!
 For lettin me make my money on the block
And get away when it get hot, uh
 We thank God!
 For them babies with them mommas who don't love 'em
And they have to grow up, fast
 We thank God!
 For everything, all them little things
For givin me my dreams, know what I mean?

I thank God for havin a mother and a father
To rely on for guidance when circumstances got harder
I'm a part of a whole race who thank God
For being able to be free and leave the plantation yard
And, I thank God for givin me the understandin to acknowledge him
Notice his footsteps and follow him
I'm walkin today, I'm talkin today
I'm feelin today, but on top of that I'm livin today
And, I thank God because he gave his only child
Would you give your only child? Think about that for awhile
And, I thank God for givin me my baby daughter
A roof over her head, and fresh clean drinkin water
And, I thank God for not being afraid to love
So all the love I give, I get back major love
And, I thank God for givin me all the blessings
To put a little piece of what we all think into this message


For all the times I thought I was in the worst situation
That I could be in
God helped me see in, them cloudy times
Them, ""I wanna get rowdy"" times
One of them, ""They tried to bring the devil out of me"" times
I thank God, for keepin my mind solid
And I respect my elders, if or if not they went to college
And, thank you Lord, for makin my bin and I swored
And I'm glad I don't feel like I have to kill to pay the bill

I was blessed to be a story teller, CD seller
My niggas be them shady fellas, chasin yella
Greedy with they eyes beady, lives easy
Dispise those who rise easy, talkin freely
Thank you for them tricks who be, talkin down
Hatin me and think that I don't, get around
The rumors and the talkin all it do is bore me
Trick I done been through a true Holly-wood story


Yea, Eightball, MJG

That he blessed us with

Only God feel the pain and only he can really see
Through the eyes of a child
A baby born wild
Gangsta shit flow through his blood and no one had to show him how
Kill or be killed where I come from ain't no in between
Why trade the world just to be a dope fiend
Hoes have a child just to take a nigga change
Twelve years later he want to know his daddy name
Maximum security prison how we get to see
The only man resemble him and this shit here ain't on T.V
Your favorite actor don't play this part
If you never live to sit you can't say his heart

You don't have to believe me (believe me)
Unless you want to believe me (believe me)

It's all real

So precious and innocent to the world
Get swallowed up and sucked up by this world
Little girl you hide your pain with all them games
Gettin' high and sellin' ya soul who can you blame

It's aiight boo I know you gotta get paid too
It's a long road

You feel no more and you don't fear no more

Not sugarcoated
Cuz where I come from shit ain't sweet
You got a choice and it ain't shit for you in them streets
Black women be a momma to ya little babies
Get on ya knees and pray to God things change daily
(Chorus)  x2

We ain't tryin to preach to ya
Just tryin' to reach to ya
See all of us are blessed with somethin'
But most of us don't take two seconds out of our days
To try to imagine somebosy elses hard times
Because ya too busy worried about cha own
If ya wanna know what real is
Real is experiencing good times and hardaches and being
Able to balance them boats
But at the same time realizing that the world will continue to
Spin with or without you
Lend me your ears, give me your spirit your conscience has to pay
Attention to what I mention
I'm your eye opener the hope for the one to will never see the suburbs
And if good life is only the word
The phrase the life that somebody else is living
Although we human most of us continue to live in
In humane, dormanes whether pictures the same
Children being born using their mothers maiden name
We play the game of life but we don't all win
Most of us ride the bench until were called in
Struggling to get noticed in the side the one-sided
On nation under God so divided
Out of touch with each others cultural activities
If you don't know someone like me than how you feelin' me
MJG, the air we breathe makes us all related
So suck it up and realize it takes us all to make it

Collard Greens,Space Age 4 Eva,2000,"Niggas ain't fuckin with us
Cause we strapped with them guns
And we always shoot 'em
Nigga u got us fucked up
Ain't no hater in us
We some real muthufuckas baby

Nigga I clown fo' mine
I get it down fo' mine
If neccesary pull shit and bust a round fo' mine
You know my sound design
For niggas street encline
Southern niggas on tha grind
Shine and recline
I stay hard like fake tits
Dig like ice-picks
Disrespect the 'Slab' and yo wig I might split
You hide we find you
Creep up from behind you
And leave you with some heat that will always remind you

Because of that big trigget
You niggas need to quit givin cheese out
You probably wear your knee's out
Yo' wife wanna leave out
But when she pull them keys out
A bunch of that please baby please
What it be'z bout
But what we be'z bout is big body
When we roll up in ya after party
Been smokin wait but hold up, stop, dont tell nobody
Stage holda, mic controller, money gripper
Toe tipper, nigga big time ho flipper


When I roll bitches
Lyrical lethal like it was dope hard Moonshine
Niggas playin like cartoon time
He get tucked in the dark room time
To a busta who done died, why?
All because he tried
What? To tell the truth about some shit
But that nigga lied
Talkin about he dont bump us in his ride
Nigga FUCK you
And the horse you rode on too
You can't fuck with me
Unless you stressed to be an absentee perminately

I dont bard no nigga talkin bout what he got
Until you show me somethin nigga you just talkin alot
Niggas love to start shit
Poppin that hard shit
Catch them alone and they convert to a broad quik
Where them niggas at?

Yeah you niggas be trippin thinkin shit is sweet dawg
We gon' keep it raw until all my niggas eat dawg

And fuck bitch niggas up when they act hata

For them niggas and them bitches tryna get up on they feet
Haters get a hollow tip deep off in they fo'head

Potent elections fo' big playaz and bitches sexin

Don't sweat the hood, gotta collect checks

Bout that real shit and bout these shady ass hoes
I hit the block when I was 12 and I ain't never leavin'
Kept a grip and kept on tippin' right through drought season
Never been a hater even at my lowest level
Some niggas get some change and sell they soul to the Devil
I'm drinkin' Dom, man I'm chiefin' on some green sticky
Space Age Pimpin' and my real niggas rollin' with me
Glocks and K's and Rugers with the rubber grip
Got 'Tel two-way transmittin' on my hip
Keep it real with them niggas that be real with me
Orange Mile forever reppin' Memphis, Tennessee - MJG

Him and me, me and him, that's how we rolled
Over ten million records sold, Platinum and Gold
We broke the mold, ain't no duplicatin' the two
Who makin' hit shit in clutch situations
And demonstratin' the real quality of a team which consists of
Eightball & MJG, we do this shit cause it feel good
First of all, we sacrificed for it
But afford it, then motherfuckers sheist for it
In the jungle of concrete just within one beat
Of the heart you can be taken apart
Ain't no regret but scars from my battlin' hard tactics
I think I'll roll with the paper, you can keep the plastic

I know you niggas got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggas stay high
I saw you at the club right?
I know you niggas keep hoes
I saw you with them freak hoes
I know you niggas got it made
I saw you on the front page

I've seen a lot of niggas come and go
Saw some shit fall and seen a lot of shit grow
Money here, money gone like a magic trick
Real hustlers hustle with or without that shit
I get my grind on daily cause I wanna see
Me and my niggas gettin' paid 'til we elderly
And it ain't hard if we all put that work in
Keep it twerkin 'til they close the fuckin' curtains
We all dream and we all have fantasies
Every nigga wanna buy that house for mama G
But life is like a roll of the dice, right
Sometimes you win and sometimes you just might
Lose it all, fucked up sick and don't know what to do
That's when you find out who really down to bust for you
I rock and roll from my heart and let my soul glow
And don't worry about what a nigga think he know, ya know?

I know you niggas got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggas stay high
I saw you at the club right?
I know you niggas keep hoes
I saw you with them freak hoes
I know you niggas got it made
I saw you on the front page

Nothin' but 24/7 - 365
Eleven to eleven I be off in the fire
Of this revolution, the solution is what I'm spittin'
Fat stacks of green backs is what I'm gettin'
Jaw bones and microphones, that's what I'm hittin'
I'm hangin' on the edge of the cliff with no mittens
Thick flickin', chrome smokin', preferred potion
Man will never touch my flow, deep as the ocean
When you go down too far and you - can't seem to light
Best to look out for that pressure baby, it bust pipes
I got too much fight - in my heart, body, my insight
Is magnifyed a thousand times, more than the average guys
My status lies right before you with no disguise
The black mack is here to step up and so I rise
My shit has gone way past cold, it's freeze dry
One brain can't do what I do, you need five

I know you niggas got doe
I saw you in them videos
I know you niggas stay high
I saw you at the club right?
I know you niggas keep hoes
I saw you with them freak hoes
I know you niggas got it made

Luxury soft leather with the real wood
Type of attitude whenever I come around
After-party baby welcome down to U-Town

I roll with them fools who love to blow trees
I represent Eightball and MJG
You wanna get down you wanna flow like us
G's from overseas blow drow like us
I love them women who got they head on straight
I love them women who like to lay it on eight
Jump in with me we can dip flip
Start a relationship with your lips and your hips

Move your body at the party at the party at the party

We gon' do it how we wanna do it
We gon' bring it how we wanna bring it
And if you can't understand how we flow
Its provision decision revision then go
And I can't understand how I'm on
And I'm still going strong with the green sticky gone out my system

Now hear me like you want me to hear you
Put your worries and your debts all behind you
And let the rythm of the Alpine find you

Puff puff till it ain't no more

Haters they try but they ain't keeping us out
We peepin the doubt but thats alright
My mic skills be tight ain't just aight
This for all my dogs who got love in they heart
Be an individual and show it in your art
For all of those who disagree we ain't trippin

How did you get the Mercedes and the Escalade lately
How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately
The black cat affair
A broken mirror
Two steps up under the ladder would bring me near her
To good luck that fucking with you
You make the sun rain
The same moment you left
Thats when the fun came

Always bumping like a bad lady ho quit that
Straight up ask a nigga to pay when he wanna hit that
Always wanna drank my Hennessey
And smoke weed
Take you out to see a movie
Hoe please
If i ain't got to get a room i don't get one
I could hit you in the car and it'll be just as fun
There's six lil letters that describe you hoe

Chocolate strawberry or vanilla couldn't shake a
Jankie ass nigga like you
You built with fly paper
Leave shit around you and its gone good-bye later

Always got your hand stuck out askin for shit
Instead of working you be begging trying to get rich quick
Faking acting like u interested just 2 hang around
Tell a nigga u a part of this and know u ain't down

Nigga I've been on, I've been off
I've been a worker, I've been a boss
Out of all the shit I've ever been, I've never been soft
I've been broke, I've been rich
And a nigga ain't never been no snitch
I'm a fat black nigga but I never had a problem gettin' no bitch
But I've been stranded, I've been alone
Had my kids before I was grown
Shot that pistol that made them young niggas
Keep that dumb shit away from my door
I've been cheated and I've been robbed
Niggas don't give a fuck who you are
Niggas don't give a fuck 'bout your status

Can have you locked down by them laws
One nigga snitch, make up some shit
Conspiracy have you behind them walls
Game so foul, not just crack
A nigga out here tryna sell y'all rap
Feel like I'm back up in that trap
I'm in that studio tryna stack my stacks
Radio only play shit that's wack
They ain't tryna hear a nigga spit these facts
So I guess I'll never get me no plaque
But shit, I'll quit 'fore a nigga to do that
Man I'm a hustler, I don't need rap
To move out the hood and live this good
I'll sell anything that a nigga buyin'
Boys better get that understood
Was born broke up in the hood but I refuse to move back

Our sisters and brothers are gone
Our babies and children are gone, but life goes on!
And so you gotta be strong because hard times
Do not discriminate, they only intimidate
Bully and eliminate people without any faith
And if it wasn't for the pitfalls in my life
I never ever woulda learned how to climb out
Some things you can't be told or taught
Some things you just gotta find out
Some people go from millions to nothing
Some people go from nothing to mils
But what both them got in common?
Neither one of them is happy still
You can bring a preacher or practice still
Or whatever your tactics is
So many people out here so fake
They need to take a break and practice real

It's my life and my life is timeless
I'm here forever, legends live on
And on and on
It's my life, my life is timeless
It's music forever
I will never change
And you will always know my name

Timeless, timeless, my life is timeless
My music is timeless, my money is timeless
Full speed ahead, mane, that's where you can find us
Space Age 4 Eva, mane, haters get behind us
Timeless, timeless, my life is timeless
My music is timeless, my money is timeless
Full speed ahead, mane, that's where you can find us
Space Age 4 Eva, mane, haters get behind us

Timeless, timeless, timeless, timeless, timeless
I just keep grindin'
Timeless, timeless, timeless, timeless, timeless

Break Em Off (Rare Vinyl)(Not the Album Version),UnKnown,1995,"I've come to break you off proper
Swish swasher through the washer
On fire, 360 degrees around the dryer
I'm tighter, the vicegrippers cut you like clippers
Your game plan loose as house slippers, how you figure?
Your small heart with your big nuts got you pumped up
You hushed up when I bucked up, you out of luck, duck
You ain't my best friend, you's another foe
And bitch you ain't my main thing, you that other so
So, let me flip the script, hit the clip
Pop it in, take a trip straight through reality
Cause who don't know the half of the
Things that I could do to you or what I'm going to
Play me up too close and I'll be showing you
Knowing you really can't hang with my flavor
But you wants approach me with this behavior
I gots my ammo, my gun – we can run, we can fight
I could end your life tonight or we could do this stuff right
I ain't wrong, I'm kickin' it back on the phone with Mrs. Jones
She lets me know the time when her husband leaves home
Well it's on, I know he pays the cost to be the boss
But if he makes it home early, I'ma have to break him off
There'll be no (no) trick busta, double crossers
Call me the devil, tricks end in the dish tosser
M J G has now spoken, your (?) has broken, stop hoping

Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper
Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper
Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper
Break it up, break it up, break 'em off proper
Break it down, break it down, break 'em off proper

All respects to the west, big ups to the east
Southside represent, blowing up like yeast
On these techniques I speak, in each flow
Broke 'em off something proper when I stepped through the door
Give me the mic so I can hype this world
Cold blooded like a snake, so you better watch your girl
I admit, no busta can't fade
Peel 'em, kill 'em dead, like Raid
Fetch her, stretch her, then bring me some competition
I kill them all with my hallucinated mental vision
Smoke a fat sack, receive distant feedback
Then commence to attack, T-Mix track
But in reality, actually the fact would be naturally
It's hard for MC's to see me
Concrete like the street under my feet
Spitting Space Age Pimpin over hype beats
White sheets and ink, record what I think
Chiefing hay, didn't blink until my eyes turned pink
UH, Gangsta Gangsta like Cube and Eazy-E
This the Wild West, baby, strapped is the way to be
911 ain't quicker than my four nickel
Wetting chests, so you better not forget your vest
It costs to be the boss in the land of the lost
Sucker free, probably breaking (?)
