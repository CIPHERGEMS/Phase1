Try Me,Ultimate Hip-hop,2014.0,"Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole motherfuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me

And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body

Bitch I got the mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
Give lil bro the choppa for all you oppas
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi
Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'
IBGM be the clique, bitch, you see us scorin'
V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'
Got a bitch that set it off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin' around wit yo nieces, bitch you T.T
Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons
Mobbin' like Italians, we really take yo fingas
Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne
Have you singin' like Alicia, fuck wit my family
They be like you little, but got damn she spazzin'
Do the whole crew, my bitches freak nasty

Fuck around and I'ma catch a body
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole motherfuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body

Bitch I got the Tommy no Hilfiger
Lil Dej ain't bout it, bitch how you figure
I don't do no drugs, I be off liquor
So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture
See I gotta get this money, my palms itchin'
Niggas gossip like hoes, most of 'em bitches
I don't wanna do no songs, I don't wanna kick it
And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent

Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole motherfuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'ma catch a body",https://genius.com/Dej-loaf-try-me-lyrics
Back Up,#AndSeeThatsTheThing,2015.0,"Back up off me, back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me

Oh yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Sayin' ""I can do you right, do you better than your exes""
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no extras
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I show no emotions, nigga's bitches it's disgustin'
Bananas with the Trojans, pop that pussy for a legend

I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
I said bitch back up off me
I said woo, I said bitch back up off me
I said woo... get this nigga
I said woah woah, yah yah, bitch back up off me

(Detroit shit)
I said... back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
(Finally Famous, nigga)

Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins
It's so cold in the D and they still wanna take my jacket off me
Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packin', you get to trippin', they unpackin', homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's salad, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Yohhh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talkin' bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expandin' on the top floor like we tannin'
She throwin' tantrums
She gon' hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage, she like...

I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
(Detroit shit nigga)
I said bitch back up off me
I said woo, I said bitch back up off me
(What up dog)
I said woo... get this nigga
I said woah, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said woah woah, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said woah woah, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said woah woah, yah yah, bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
I said... back up off me, I said bitch back up off me

Yeah that's right nigga

Me U & Hennessy,Sell Sole,2014.0,"Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside you got me screamin'
You got me yellin' out yo name, ooh, I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a Bimmer
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not gonna lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you

You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me

I love how you push it in so deeply
Make my body quiver, baby, make my feet shake
I love how you kiss me on both set of lips
Lick me 'til I cum, ayy this that shit you won't forget
Okay, let's play, baby finish your plate
I'm tuggin' on your zipper and you grabbin' on my waist
No games, foreplay, shut up, do what I say
Open up your mouth, put this pussy on your face
Nigga behave, that's exercise, he ain't nothin' like them extra guys
Got myself a real nigga, so hatin' hoes would be glad to get him
Just chill with him, iced up on chill with him
Couple shots of that Peach Ciroc, he know I'm gon' deal with him
I'm like what's wrong with him, pussy wet, no thong with him
Strip club, in my zone with him, throwin' money on my old nigga
I'm gone, nigga, silent mode, no phones with it
Never fuck with no broke nigga
He know I ain't know gold digger
He got me like

Love ain't ever been so easy
Love ain't ever been so easy
I love how you make it so easy

I'm in the studio, then I pull out to your crib
Scratches on your back, I didn't mean to do that, baby
I couldn't help myself, you be fuckin' me so crazy
On the couch, on the sink, in the shower, you a freak
In the whip, the backseat, windows tint, they can't see
You know how it goes, I ain't gotta say shit
I want this here forever, just me and you to the end

Love ain't ever been so easy
Love ain't ever been so easy

Pussy get wet when I go Miley Cyrus
All my jewelry water like a fuckin' fire hydrant
When shawty get on top it looks like hydraulics
And when I nut I leave a milked body
And these hoes straight out of Follie's
That pussy Batman, but my dick is Robin
Might catch me blowin' in it like a cartridge
You can do him, bitch he the same as me
I'm not gon' cuff her like the damn police
69 is the only time that you ain't a dime
When it's time I fold your ass up like a pork rind
Girl sit down, now she done jumped up off the porch now
I done planted a nigga crosses like the Lord now

Stretch that pussy out like it's pilates
The way that I be ridin' like I called shotty
He fuck me like he straight up out the can yo
He push it in so deep, I be like, ""Damn, yo""
More than 15 seconds, put it on the Gram
We go so ham
Solid nigga make solid moves, tie me up, that's that solitude
Bend it over, let you bottom bang
Eat me up, that's that badaboom
And that's my baby
You drive me crazy
Yeah that's my baby
Yeah why you drive me crazy?
That's my baby, why you drive me crazy?
You my baby, you drive me crazy

It ain't no ho in my blood, born and raised in them slums
Took my daddy away when I was 4
Why would I give a fuck about y'all?
Ain't no ho in my blood, been thorough since day 1
Lost a couple people, ever since then I've been numb
Ain't no ho in my blood, Sell Sole gon' flood
If I don't make it off of this again fuck this shit, I'm done
Cause ain't no ho in my blood, no hoes in my circle
Loyalty over love, I'll kill a bitch on purpose
Cause ain't no ho in my blood, everybody 100
All I know is flip it back, we don't do no frontin'
We don't do no runnin', it ain't in my DNA
Blood thicker than water, but my money thicker than that

They are some hoes, hoes, let's talk about these hoes
Sellin' all that pussy yet you ain't go no prose
Bitch you slow, slow, slow

Moochin' off your niggas, you can't stand up on your own
Boy you's a ho, ho, ho
Boy you's a ho, ho, ho

No ho in my blood, always been a boss
Always had style, no matter what it cost
Other bitches, they was fuckin', I was all about the money
I was in the 7th grade, shootin' dice for the money
Tryna hit this other 9-5, writin' rhymes by the nightlight
Tryna get us up out the hood
So I could have all my people lookin' and livin' good

No police, if I like that shit I cop
No Rollie but you can watch

Grindin' like a skater, nigga
I get fresh and go straight to the mall and bait a nigga
You want beef? I can cater nigga
I'm not a ho or pussy, so she ride that dick like a Speed Racer, nigga
Started from the bottom, came straight to the top
No dad but if he play, he get popped
You ain't real, squad, so you can't come to the block
I'ma rich and blood but I ain't come with a mop
I'ma pop his top, proceed to the top
Let these bullets work on a nigga's body like a doctor

Real killers moving in silence, Ask Oba

All of these niggas be goofy rats
Telling on everything moving
I was in Austin and I was feeling real groovy
Shoutout my boy Trae he put on for Houston
I say, ""who want it with me?""

Ready for war like, who coming with me?
Got goons who feel like what's the point in living
With these niggas hoes, so what's the point in trippin'
Crack a nigga head like a fortune cookie
Like a choice pussy, wet you all with like
Like moist pussy

Get a hand going for a buck fifty

I ain't missing out on no meals

Cut a nigga face like seals
I'm so trill, I'm so 'bout it
My music give me chills, ahh

Promise if I could, I'd do it twice

Hold on, I got more to say

I know my life can get so crazy but as long as you're right here

Cause what we have is something special

Only thing that was missing was you
Who would've thought we wouldn't be married by now
We been true lovers since high school
Let's live our life, dancin' all night
You are where you should be, I want this for life

I Got It,Sell Sole,2014.0,"What up, family?
Tryna wake 'em up cousin
I say R.I.P. to my cousin
Tryna wake 'em up cousin

Walking devil, I be feeling like Jesus
I don't know much about that Bible, never felt like I need it
I told my mom that I got her, when I make it we even
For all the years she took care of me and my brothers believin'
I miss my grandma, why did she have to leave me?
I had so much shit to tell her, damn man, I still can't believe it
We balling out, nah, we ain't up in no bleachers
You hear my songs on the radio, baby, turn up yours speakers
Cause we own now and we grown now
First million, go and tell 'em it's on now
I still sip Arizonas
And I do this shit for all of my loners
Screaming to the top of my lungs like ""Mama, I'mma make it""
Gotta speak it to existence then you gotta have patience
Just stay in your lane, fuck anybody hatin'
Love don't love nobody so don't worry about datin'
Just worry about Dej whether you singing or you rappin'
All these bitches got opinions
Cause you fucking over half 'em
Anybody want war it ain't shit to get it crackin'
Cause nigga where I'm from they use alleys for the caskets
I'm not tryna promote violence, a lot of shit be on my conscience
Never been baptized, I got demons in my body
And I pray from time to time, I be like ""Lord, get 'em off me""
I just want to be wealthy, way more to it than money
Don't nobody keep it real, half these rappers is phony
They ain't really getting money, pockets flat as my stomach
I don't merge in niggas' lanes, I got tunnel vision
Fuck a buffalo stud no pun intended
It's so hard, I still play it like Pun existed (Big Pun)
Teach the kids to be bosses, no dumb decisions
Look, all y'all fraud niggas, all y'all broad niggas
And most of 'em foul, that's exactly why I charge bitches
My niggas put up buckets, pour some soul with it
You got a team full of ball hoggers and soft niggas
Scared to let your mans ball, these niggas Ken dolls
I'mma put me on then put my friends off
Niggas try to talk to me, I put 'em in that friend zone
Sophisticated thug, you know the suit, ties, the Timbs on
We be off the Hen-dog, don't chase it for nothing
And you be on that bullshit, basically fronting
I'm basically running, anything go in front me
Try to stop me, I go crazy, I get to clicking and dumping
I probably leave a nigga boiling like chickens and dumplings
Cornbread, cabbage, soul food, I'll blow up your muffin
Fuck it, all I want is checks with them commas with no drama
Respect, loyalty, money and power
Round table, we gon' eat like them mobsters
I'm a monster, this music shit it come so easy, I got it
Bitch, I got it, oh, I got it
Bitch I got it
It come so easy, I got it
I got it

Been On My Grind,#AndSeeThatsTheThing,2015.0,"Go Grizz, when I say go
Hey, hey-ey
I've been on my hustle
It ain't too many people I look up to
I've been grinding, I've been grinding
I've been grinding, I've been grinding
I've been grinding
Look, I've been on my grind all week
I ain't been getting no sleep
But that shit don't matter to me
My momma said ""it should matter to me""
She said ""your health is everything""
Right Momma look, momma I've been road running
I just signed a few deals and the shows coming
I can't let my fans down, I gotta run it up
I can't let a bitch catch me, fuck a runner up
I said ""lets turn the summer up""
All these other girls quiet, word to my mother
Man I put that on the Bible
All this gossip gossip people talking, man they got me fucked up
They want to see me down, broke back on my luck
I don't trust nobody rather do it on my own
Get them squares out yo circle, leave them pussy boys alone
Leave them pussy boys alone
Niggas with hidden agendas, I hope you offended
Cut the middle man out, I need all of my inches
Cause niggas don't have passion, they just in it to fit in
I'm really in this shit to finish, niggas goofy they grinning too much
Get the fuck out my business
A lot of these niggas, they was raised like hoes
You ain't gotta be a killer to get my respect, pussy nigga
Ay just play yo role, you boys shaped like hoes
Y'all hate like hoes, we move different ain't like those
We ain't gon' fold fold, we ain't gon' lose fall
We ain't gon' fail, we ain't gon snitch
We ain't gon tell, nigga
(Why would we do that, huh? You gotta ask yourself)
Look, I done been broke before I ain't going back (naw)
Lil bro just came home he said ""he ain't going back""
So I gotta protect him, I feel like I've been neglected
Ready for change but don't wanna work in no register
So, just imagine all that pressure on me
Man, this shit is chess not checkers homie
Can't get to you, we'll probably get your homie
Don't get stuck in living in the moment
I was raised by real niggas no Jabronis
Said I was raised by real niggas no jeroni
I'm a living legend nigga Kony Kony
Ridin' with the woo, got my Kony Tony
Tony, Toni Braxton, or Anita Baker
Left wrist skating, diamonds dancing like Jamaica
I keep a couple niggas, but ain't got a lot of patience
If I want it, Imma take it, ain't trynna sound like no rapist
I be in the D, bake potatoes all like papers
I know why niggas mad cause I never need they favors
And I still rock the with bucks, I ain't never had a trainer
Miami beach trippin' got the doors off the wranglers
Times get hard, old friends call you stranger
But I ain't even change, I just bossed up and made it
You should be happy, you should want to do the same shit
A boss is way more than just giving out a paycheck
No music, couple old friends turnin' the bases
I'm getting closer to God, I'm getting back to the basics
I've been had the vision since That's So Raven
And I never needed to said things, I knew I was greater
If I stayed the same, they would've love it
Performing in my room to performing out in public
It's 2k15, niggas score getting buckets bucket
Let them pussies have it, make it feel it in they stomach, nigga
(We gon' make them feel it every single time, every time. I mean why not?)
(It feel like, I've been waiting my fucking life for this)
I've been on my grind all week (I ain't going back)
I ain't been getting no sleep
But that shit don't matter to me

Pay me a check or I can't show up to your soundcheck
All these goofy ass rappers on that clown shit
On your fifth mixtape and ain't nobody heard shit
Maybe you boys should slow it down
I think smart, my shit comin', it's goin' down
Can't beat us, you niggas better join us now
Best believe I got these rappers disappointed now
All these bitches turnt up, I'm finna turn 'em down
Tell 'em that I'm back and I still got my fuckin' crown
We don't rap beef, we really clap heat
Put the tip to your lips, that's a black and mild
Fuck these hipsters and their fuckin' style
I'd rather wear my own shit, fuck a hand-me-down
And fuck all of these fake lean sippers
Above dreams, these niggas ain't seen different
They played the wrong roles, now my scene different
I'm a dog with this shit and these fleas itchin'
Used to do shit for free, now the fee is different
Cause I done came up, now I need interest
I said fuck tryna please, nigga
I'm like please, nigga, shout out to my team, nigga

I said we good over here
I said we good over here, I swear, I swear, I swear
I said we good over here
I said we good over here, I swear, I swear, I swear

I'm just tryna stack these ten bars
Where the fuck these labels at? They shoulda been called
I be goin' off the handle
Nigga think he hard, I'ma tell him pull his pants down
I'm on hold with Interscope
Let me click over for Def Jam
If they ain't talkin' a couple mil'
Then they can just forget it, fam
Cause I be spittin' crack, make a rap bitch snort a line
In the studio, you ain't got a hit, you wastin' time
Most of these rappers fake, they was lame before they made a song
I've been the shit, and that's word to my fuckin' mom
New scarf on my head, niggas thinkin' I'm a Crip
And my Blood got on blood, we on some gangsta shit
Born to get money and I'm too legit to quit

Lately I've been under pressure
Make me wanna put a fuck nigga on a stretcher
They like, ""Damn, why you so aggressive?""
Cause I've been going through some things
And I'm tired of playing with these niggas
All this pain I done been through tryna change how we living
Rock shows and throw them old chains in the venues
We don't hang out the window, might aim out the window
Keep it on the low, ""DL"" my initials
Niggas be dickriders, I ain't worried 'bout competition
Don't bring them bitches up cause on my dogs, I'll sick 'em

Wan't beef? I'll serve a bitch that old pie dinner
That's fireplace, we might pop up where your mama stay
Park inside her driveway, car ain't got no license plate
Success be like a block away, get the fuck up out my way
How you feel, closer to my dreams like Goapele

Treat a nigga like a ho
I got what you need
I got what you want

Watch how you’re speaking on me, get hit with this shotty
I got some shooters in the back, they’re off them mollies
And I ain’t tryna act tough, I’m really bout it
I don’t want that boy, I’d rather have his daddy
One thing about me, ain’t none of these niggas had me
I’m consistent with this shit, I make my own flips
I write my own flows, I whip my own shit
Boss slave, got levels, Ballys on the pedal
Switching lanes, blowing kisses at you fucking devils
Grinding hard for this shit, niggas know me better
Don’t be a bitter nigga, go and get your shit together


Tell all these niggas if they want this money
They gon’ have to take it from me
Working hard, paper on me like a mummy
Thumbing through that cheque, got me feeling like a junkie
Said, “they gon’ love me ‘fore it’s over with”
They gon’ love me ‘fore it’s over with
These bitches hoping that I’m gonna quit
But I ain’t stopping till it’s over with

God chose me and I'll be Goddamned
If I let another soul try to wheel me in
If it was meant to be, you would be right here
New phone, who dis? Ain't heard from you in years
And they could never call me selfish
Gave chances after chances
Mama knows best, mama said they all jealous
And I ain't gon' lie, that shit is scary when the people that you love
Don't wanna see you flaunt, don't wanna see you eat
They wanna take your porridge
They wanna see you different, they wanna see you normal
I just want my bro free, ""Freeman"" like Morgan
I'm blessed and I struggle, you don't know my story
Yeah, and shit, soon I'll be married
Hope to see you and your children at my wedding, my baby

Old friends that turned into strangers
Ex-lovers mad that I’m famous
They see the picture I painted
I've been going through changes
I prayed to God and I made it
Nobody did me no favors
I’m sorry if you can’t take it
I've been going through changes

I've been going through changes
I've been going through changes",https://genius.com/Dej-loaf-changes-lyrics

When she calls you and pick up, (hello) cause I dont do all of that
Feels so wrong, I wonder why do fools fall in love
Can't help myself, I'm drunk, I done had three shots of that
They dreaming, going back to Cali, with the rooftop missing

I don't wanna feel no more

I don't wanna feel no more
Gotta let me heart heal some more
I don't wanna be frill no more
I just wanna be numb to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
Look what I've done to you
Look what you've done to me, look what I've done to you
I just wanna be numb to you

Causin' all this commotion
When we both know we're not supposed to be together
Started off with good conversation
How we end up sleepin' together?
I can't change what we did
I can't change the first time that we kissed
And then we kissed again, then we kissed again
Then it turned into relationship, damn
How did this happen?
Whole two years, I done dodged hella traffic
I was in too deep, I was losin' hella focus
I was broke down bad, I ain't really have nothin'
You was right there with me, found another side of me
Any time I need a lift, you would rise to me
Funny how things change
You ain't even have the guts to say bye to me
I don't wanna feel you no more
I'm so numb, I'm so numb, numb, numb
Shit, I'm done tryna figure you out
Remember, we used to freak on the couch when all our friends left the house
I don't trust nobody
Probably went over your head
I've been holdin' it in, I've been wantin' to say it
Let me say it again, I don't trust nobody
Nobody

Look at me now, I done moved up, and you gone
We was holdin' on to somethin' that was never gon' happen
I was holdin' on to you cause I was scared of what happened
We was fuckin' and laughin', you was hittin' it backwards
We would fuck with that passion, I couldn't even imagine
Us not together
But I guess shit happens

Can't change how I feel
Can't change how I feel
I can't change what happened
I can't change what happened

You had bitches callin' and textin'
Givin' me the runaround like it's fuckin' gymnastics
One time for all them bitches you messed with
Hope the best cause I'm happy you flexed 'em
Changed my dreams, God steady sendin' me blessings
Fuck relationships, I got my mind on my cheddar
Out of sight, out of mind, got a flight at 11
I'ma do a show in Houston and go back to New Orleans
I said, ""How are you doin'?""
Might have called once or twice, askin', ""Who are you screwin'?""
That was just me, in my feelings
Just thinkin' 'bout the times you held my face in the pillow
Full of tears, full of tears to that thing in the middle
Now that we're done, I'm just seein' you different
Now when I see you, I'm just greetin' you different
Two years, I can't believe we're finished
I can't believe it
I'm long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
Look at me now

I don't wanna feel no more
Gotta let me heart heal some more
I don't wanna be frill no more
I just wanna be numb to you

Tonight, I don't really want any strings attached
He a fly ass nigga, got wings attached
I seen what he do, plus he seen me rap
Winked his eye, meet me in the back
Hopped in the Jag, now we on the dash
Told him to slow down, he diminuted fast
Pulled up to the crib, I'll give him my ass
Telling me he been wanting me since we was in class
He got a real big deal and a tongue to match
I got some shit up my sleeve that will make a mess
Open up the door, we let the music blast
Round one ain't over let's make it last

Tonight, I wanna love your body
Tonight, I want somebody to feel this love

Bird Call,Sell Sole,2014.0,"Aye, that's that bird call
All these haters got my nerves bad
Writing rhymes in my word pad, feeling like I can't be touched
Drinking VOSS as a chaser
I got to get this paper for my unborn creations
Promise we gon' live it up, we ain't worried about haters
I promise they gon' give it up, and if not we gon' take it
I got a temper this short and I barely got patience
He got a dick this long, I think he from Jamaica
These niggas talking like they killers, I just call them pretenders
I'm getting money with my niggas, I don't want y'all around me
Ain't drop an album in two years these dummies thinking I lost it
They done buried me alive, i'm bout' to climb out this coffin
Let me find out that you hating, Imma fucking assault you
Put a hammer to your head, got some shit that would shock you
Put the plug in your ass, that's them battery chargers
Heard your plug had a shortage, need a battery charged
I'm looking in the sky like damn they can't handle your daughter
Fuck they mean I'm trying to pull up in that Phantom or something
Dirty Sprite, Cream Soda, dirty Fanta or something
I couldn't work no 9 to 5 , I wasn't good taking orders
But I promise with this music I be feeling immortal
I swear she would have been a beast, R.I.P. cousin Portia
And just for you I'm a cop me like two of them Porshes
I was down on my luck I had to use all my sources
No magazine spreads, couple funeral service
Time to clean the hood up, that community service
We ain't tipping no dancers, y'all bitches be worthless
Might pull up to the club in like two of them suburbans
I touch souls nigga, from the hood to the burbs'
Bitches steady sending shots, they confusing their words
I'm a dog with this shit, I pooper scooper these turds
Diamonds dancing like Omarion in You Got Served
Tell that lame she don't want it, I been getting money
Stop flashing that little jewelery cause my little homies on it
They'll snatch it right up off your neck
Flaunt your shit then sell it back
Nikki said ""Stop holding back"", they sleeping on me, taking naps
It's time to wake these pussies up, big dog to these cats
All I know is keep it real, all I know is stating facts
All I know when I get home, ain't gonna' do no turning back
All y'all know is turning up, don't know how to get a check
I know it's my time now, I don't think they get it yet
Open up your lid and put a symbol on your fitted cap
Think about it, let it sit
Yeah bitch, remember that?
He think that we going far, he should have used this thinking cap
Old flames calling me, they trying to rekindle that
But they know i'm about my money, they know i'm not into that
Sneak dissing twitter shit, I ain't with the internet
Log off and get smacked, I ain't with the chitter chat
Million dollar baby, i'm so million dollar wavy
I can't wait to make a million goin' million dollar crazy
Millionaire in the making, Benjamins and them Franklins
I'm running right next to greatness, yeah bitch that's adjacent

I'm out here grinding for a life that could never be basic

All I Want For Christmas,UnKnown,2016.0,"I say each year
Gets better than the last year
We going all out this year
I need everybody's sizes
Don't worry 'bout me
Got plenty of material things
Got my brothers, got my sisters, got my team
All I need is my family
I say, I say my past ain't like my presence
Momma come downstairs, open up your presents
Workin' all them hours tryna make it special
I was ungrateful, I ain't know no better

All I really want for Christmas is you
All I really want for Christmas is you
All I really want for Christmas is you
All I really want for Christmas is you

Life ain't tied with a bow but it's still a gift
Then hit the club and make it rain, I ain't talking deer
And all I wanted for Christmas was to be here
Now I'm hoping I could spend it with you this year
God bless me with a talent, gotta make it happen
You see this rap shit is my gift, I gotta unwrap it
And I know that I've been naughty
But I just want you to stand by me
And I just want to go all the way
Cause when I'm with you it’s a holiday
There’s no other place I’d rather be
Than right here with my family
And it feels so good to be free
You all I really want

All I really want for Christmas is you
All I really want for Christmas is you
All I really want for Christmas is you
All I really want for Christmas is you

It's snowing outside
Miss the days when it used to be up to my thighs
Man I miss my baby, wanna spend some time
Sometimes I feel like we just live to die
That's why I'm so grateful, lord I'm breathing
I won't be complaining, and don't you either
Eggnog drinking, sleigh bells ringing
Santa I wish you could bring back some of my people

Nah, forreal. I remember those Christmas mornings man. Waking up and going downstairs and I ain't gon' lie, I used to be ungrateful, I was a very ungrateful kid. I used to cry every Christmas cause I didn't get the Mikes. I don't know what it was about the Christmas Mikes, my mom just wouldn't get 'em. Like, I don't know man, it was crazy. Cause I used to get everything else, like, I used to get all the other shoes. But she just didn't get the Christmas Mikes. And, you know, you gotta walk back in school with the fresh Mikes on at the top of the year. So I used to be mad upset. But now looking back man, I'm so appreciative man, you know. You can't take those types of things for granted. Family means everything. Christmas is more than just about, you know, gifts. Celebrate yourself, celebrate your family, your friends. And the ones who stand by you every day. Merry Christmas",https://genius.com/Dej-loaf-all-i-want-for-christmas-lyrics

Getting right with God, cause real talk I'm a God
I was dead broke and it was all because of pride
I'm alive money on my mind, for my team I'mma ride
I ain't worried bout the drive, it's time to go get it and grind
Put them people to the side, wait and let them see you shine
They gon' hate but that's life, you live it and take flights
Doing shows every night, thanking god for the life
I earn my stripes, I'm a boss, started cutting people off
Talking shit and drinking

, don't ask me what it cost
Real talk, this that shit you play in your loft
We trying take it so far you rolling get in the car
They rolling it in the car, no smoking but keep a jar
I never thought small, I loved everything large
Started coming up head blue like mars
I started coming up stay humble couldn't fumble

My Life

Look I was raised on the north end for a couple years
They say my mama lost it, so my grandma took us in
It was me my two brothers and my older cousins kids
We ain't really had no food so they hit the store and steal
Ayo I'm for real, starving if you want 
And I was always shy, so I ain't never had no friends
My brother he was ten, running errands for them ends
Like take this here go give it to my mans
But, Ayo I don't even know
He was doing what he was told and that's how it had to go
He was doing what he was told and thats how it had to go
When my mama came through, she would come and she would go
We would cry our eyes out and get a whipping for it though
My grandma sold Y-B, and she did it for the dough
And I ain't want to go to bed cause there'd be mice all on my floor
Mama bring us clothes and we we're happy little souls
Like, this yours, that yours go head and try it on
My Grandma always kept a couple hoes
I thought they were her friends, turns it out it was some more
She had a thing for women, my brother was kinda feminine
Ain't trying to sound down, just some shit I be rememberin'
East side Detroit, dirty glove Michigan
I'm just telling my story and I hope yall can picture it
(why)
Aye cause this how I came up, situations made me tough
Made me realize what was what
What the fuck I was a kid, I ain't really know much
All I wanted was my mama my daddy and packed lunch
But, instead I got whippings and took em like I was tough
It wasn't much, I was a solider
Knew we'd be with moms again
Cause we had to move east when they took Grandma to the pin
I was prayin', but I knew we'd see her once again
She got a couple years but that was time for us to spend
Time with my Mom, time for us to bond
Mom, I'm your daughter and I really like to rhyme
I want to shine like you, I want to grind like you
I want a house with a view, and a nice sized pool
What it do, I met my best friend when we moved
She was cool, a year younger
We went to the same school
We played pool, played ball with the boys
I was cute, but I hated when they call me tomboy
(why)
I guess it was insecurities
Skinny little girl couldn't wait to reach puberty
I waited long enough, seventeen I lost my purity
Found someone I love, my love he was feelin' me
But life goes on, I'm too strong like seriously
They killed my little cousin, I ain't gon lie it was killin' me
My Grandma died peacefully, and she ain't seemed sick to me
Week later they found lil Greg in an alley, He
Just graduated man that shit fucked up the family
Tragedy they run in threes
I got a job to get my little brother off them streets
Them shits weak, I got asthma I can barely breathe
I got in college with a 15 on my ACT
Trying to tell me I couldn't read, fuck outta here (please..please)
Look, but in class I would fall asleep
Writing rhymes through the lectures
I got to make it, I'm so desperate

'Cause before I need you, you gonna need me
You be lookin' for me, ain't no tellin' where I'll be
And sure like I'll be
I got rich off my nigga beats
I got rich off my boys
I can do anything
Reality, made them changes undeniably
I didn't have a choice
It's the only thing fittin' me
Just been in the cut, watchin' the energy
Yeah, I ain't feelin' your energy
I'mma keep on making history
Keep on buildin' my legacy
If I could, I would
In my city passing druggers
I can't barely lift eyelids
Outta spaceships like a Spy Kid
I got they attention undivided
I done sling back gave 'em slices
Cortez like Nike
I had to do it even though it was pricey
I got habits, I got vices
Wanna kick it?
No devices
I'm not looking for love, you can't wrap me
Too much time, he gon' wanna whack me
Spend my time when niggas dance just like me
Say she in a barrel like me, lil' Jada
Blow a nigga back with a hot potato
Ask my brother I would never ever tate 'em
I do everything that I'm able
My DJ turn the turn tables
My soldier boy turned into dicko yeah
We takin' out your plugs and your cables
We lit on all plugs and the cables

We tried to play the plug and the cable
They tried to tell me I couldn't do it by myself
I'm doing shows felt like I'm moving by myself
So up I can't move by myself
So much pain niggas asking am I tough?
I see the world through my buffs
I put my pain in my music and it stop
Put a paint on a nigga light him up
Been with the same, same niggas from the dust
When I'm caught in wrong, had to take the city bus
Run it up
Put your money where my money at we can ante up
Talkin' film, flm, film, picture us
Take, take, take VHS
I know you tryna reach your mark but you can't market us
Niggas blank but I'm talkin' less
I'm so heartless, freeze my flesh
So unbothered got these niggas tighter than a dress
They like ""What she gonna do next?""
The real question is, what they gonna copy next? (That's the real question)
What they gonna copy next
I heard you, yeah, I copy that
Yeah, copy cat
You nigga ain't shit but some copy cats

I seen more you, you seen me
Blind as you can be
And it hurts me just to see
Hurt my head just to think
Hurt my eyes just to blink
Take me to a place where I can be out of reach
I know you used to fuckin with basic broads
You wondering if I can take it all
I can but can you provide it all
I can but can you provide it all",https://genius.com/Dej-loaf-provide-at-all-lyrics

My daddy put a nigga on, got killed for the bros

If your people was rats, then you're bloodline
We can't find out where you at, then your 'cuz dyin'
I just count it out, two hunnid, gave me butterflies
I order steak when I get hungry, get it butterfly
Come back in white hunnids, bitch, I'm colorblind
Tore up street, it's easy money, fuck the other side
It's a thirty on your chop, it's a drum on me

I put M30s in her skirt, told her, ""Hold this""
I got a Uzi in this Vert, spray the whole clip
It's easy money

I'm thinkin' new Patek, you thinkin' Somerset
My daddy had them keys, still got his set
I made two hunnid off the piece thanks to my connect
Just excuse me if I sneeze, a nigga really blessed
They tried to give her forty Gs, niggas really stressed
I showed a crib from overseas, I thought the bench was pressed
I made a deal for thirty Gs, I had my bitch collect
I skate the plug, can't really read, still show respect
We made a fortune off them Bs, nigga, get some rest
Might send a fortune at your team, hit a nigga set
Ain't no abortions in our genes, from my daddy pack

And a freak out the country just to get her waist snatched
I fuck niggas' bitches, boy, you can't hit mine
You ain't got one kid and I can't switch mine
Like a fight in the hair salon, you see clips flyin'
My son, daddy, he would never be like 6ix9ine
I hit her and both her friends, that's a three-peat
You fucked that little bitch raw and she got BB
In your bitch pussy or the bank is where you see me
Understand I'm pointin' at niggas like you E.T
Got the best route, we like Waze with this shit
I head off for BME and you paid for the bitch
Gave it up in thirty minutes, you spent days with the bitch
I hurt your feelings, they had that dad take your bitch, huh
We sell drugs, I'm swipin' too, huh

And If yall ever see her, yall can tell her that I'm living it up
I'm living it up, I'm living it up
I'm living it up

Mrs. Williams was my third grade teacher
I remember everything about her
I remember when she told me that my attitude wasn't going to get me far
Always talking shit, I swear she always pissed me off
Waddup, Look what my attitude got me
Remember all them maps that we used to have to copy
Well, I'm in Hong-Kong, probably in Milan
With a shoe on that cost more than what you work for


Now you still wear them ugly ass glasses
Always bragging about your daughter, like shes so fantastic
Shut the fuck up, fuck her, fuck you too
You almost failed me that year, I had to go to Summer school
It was obvious that you ain't like me and I ain't like you
I used to want to be a teacher, but never like you
I'm sitting in class, I would laugh at you full bid
I can't believe they put me in your class for a full year


Mrs. Williams was my third grade teacher
I remember everything about her
I remember when she, would never let me
Go to the bathroom, just sitting in the classroom acting a damn fool
Well, look who I'm shitting on now
I bet the work I do now is making my mama proud
Calling my house trying to get me in trouble
""Hello, this is Mrs. Williams, can I speak with Ms. Trimble""
Shut the fuck up, Aye we don't have the same last names
And If I get in trouble tomorrow I'mma do the same thing
No lunch break? You're excluding me
Five minutes late, truancy
She got me messed up, but God bless her
I used to write my raps, she'd tell me put that mess up
Well that mess, is what got my checks up
Yeah that mess, is what got me next up",https://genius.com/Dej-loaf-mrs-williams-lyrics
