Just What I Am,Indicud,2012.0,"I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, ""Ain't no music on"", she said, ""No, that weed is loud""
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

I'm just what you made God, just what you made God 
(Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self
, 
these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, 
whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore,
 
amidst a dream with no exit doors

I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Need it to get by, ya

Pursuit of Happiness (Nightmare),Man on the Moon: The End of Day,2009.0,"Mmmm
, ay-oh
Hey...
Ratatat, yeah!
Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey

Day ‘n’ Nite (Nightmare),A Kid Named Cudi,2008.0,"Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night

Soundtrack 2 My Life,Man on the Moon: The End of Day,2009.0,"I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn, or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room and soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand fame

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down: pussy and some 
Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

To my life, to my life, to my life…

The Prayer,A Kid Named Cudi,2008.0,"Plain Pat, what up?

My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

I'm ready for that
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it

Erase Me,Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager,2010.0,"She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

I'm Yeezy, she say ""Hi, I'm Aria""
No, you a angel, you wave ""Hi"" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, ""No, not my Aria""
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you",https://genius.com/Kid-cudi-erase-me-lyrics

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be OK to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky

Never get congratulated

I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy

Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche

All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately

Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the haunted ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow

I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
All right

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart
 
and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, whoh

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night,
 
young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh

Especially Brooklyn, shout out to the Madis

Aiming high, passed the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man

If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad, my nigga

Woo!

Down, down for a—damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a payday
Said, ""Bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J""
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right, and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so

Cudi Zone,Man on the Moon: The End of Day,2009.0,"Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact
Now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb –
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin' you can think about marriage
Until then get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is — When the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I forget about it all


In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright

Solo Dolo Part II,Indicud,2013.0,"I don't need, I don't need nobody

Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22
 
mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!""
 (oh you dead nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22

Don’t be prejudiced, cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named Maria, its your turn, I love them señoritas
I like to fuck 'em, then I say fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something

Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway
So, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end they'll judge me anyway

I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now

So sing along lil mama

A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine and the ghost within
This is the journey, of the Man on the Moon",https://genius.com/Kid-cudi-up-up-and-away-lyrics
Heart of a Lion (Kid Cudi Theme Music),Man on the Moon: The End of Day,2009.0,"Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it use to be like David and Goliath
Kinda like me and the Devil
Tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

At the end of the day, day
My momma told me don't let no one break me
Let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me
Ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying
If you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion
Yeah

Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream I seem to glide above my horror
Though I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable
And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told you, no I'm not a loser, I'll see you in Hell

At the end of the day, day
My momma told me don't let no one break me
Let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me
Ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying
If you were trying
At the end of the day, day

Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah (Yeah)

I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing
No cash or check could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code
I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know
The fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you
No, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell

At the end of the day, day
My momma told me don't let no one break me
Let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me
Ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day

Wish it wasn't my imagination running away with a dream
Your eyes they tell it all called it
Hope you have a good heart and you're smart
You've got a good head on your shoulders
That's what turns a nigga on, strong feelings that I have
You'll probably never, find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing

How'd you get so fuckin cool?
Fools probably try to spit at you daily
The price you pay cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding
Man you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around if ever
You got it going on young lady

Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady

You turn a nigga on, these feelings I have
You'll find out never, unless you're clever

Mad Solar,Indicud,2013.0,"I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen, and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Take one to know one
Can we talk, just loony to loony?
How strange the notion
You don't really know no one
And what if I told you
You no longer know me
You better keep going and keep it rolling now
Ain't no thing, you don't really need me
The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold you
Into someone way colder
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar

Ain't no other way I can be

Guess I got to finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healing slow
Hope I don't live to grow old, no one at home
Staring at myself in the mirror, take one to know one
Want to find out 'bout the real me?
Certain moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But want to act like they know me
You better keep going and keep on strolling
It's so crazy how you think you can play me
Show them pussies you're growing
Hard times, they mold you
To the haters, I told you
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

Hello, what it be

Salutations to all, you can call me Cudi

Way my doors are swayin', it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep, you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see

You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine

Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it, M dub it
Blood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em
I been sayin' it, you was playin' him

We ain't boppin' on money
Fuck with me 'cause you real
See you shakin' it fast
On some Mystical shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that
The crack that I brew is still new
Y'all niggas think acute
But Cudi is obtuse

These walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black

The ceiling is all I have, downward from here

Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here

Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
All is life and all is pain
Down the hallway of my endless fate

Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea

Come on, dream on
Come on, come on
Dream on, no worries

Don’t Play This Song,Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager,2010.0,"Hey, let's have some fun this time

Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right
Please, please don't play this song

Pain, hurt, sadness and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how to teach a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song (Please don't play this song)
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (Right)

Please, please don't play this song (Yeah, hey)

Black Robin Hood, riding high just like we should
You know the saying, ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Yeah, demented, my brain was forced to transform
Wise up, I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it; ""Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay.""
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
Bet some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders, HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar, bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself, hovered

Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (—ight)
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right (Me)
R-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right (They thinking 'bout me)

Make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to rewire your whole fucking mainframe, sick of the same
Lame old same thing

I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better

Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to the many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge

I love shittin' on these niggas, that is my fave
Can't fuck with an unstoppable force
That lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
One two, one two, assholes now please listen close
I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah, so I don't slit nobody throat
Aw, it ain't my fault, homie thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face and watch the blood leak
Put my ear where his jaw was, tell a nigga to speak

Was only scared of my father, beyond that I'm

I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again (hey), do it again (hey)
I’d never do it again (hey)
Cuz this is the end

My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snowman, old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger

Do it again, I’d never do it again

This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end (uh), I’d never do it again

Chilling, rolling up something to change my feelin'
Thinkin about how I came up from nothing while I’m
Splitting this cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again

Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end, I’d never do it again

Cheese came through at 3
Salute, at ease, C had supplied the weed
Cause IBN had OD'd
It's me with a black rockstar steeze
Real rock tees, 300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think that's the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending

Will the rainstorms ever end?
Still I feel my
Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
And then you see 'em
Grey clouds up above man
Metaphoric to my life man
Still I feel my
Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
Until then I roll
More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
Still I feel my
Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping when my head doze
But I ain't sleep
Awake in another state
Living in a new space
Still I feel my
Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race

Lightning piercing through another land

Soul searching each and every way

Awesome sound, so profound
When it – it'll grip you
You can see it
If you hear it you can feel it too
Something special I am running to
Until then I go
Away, very far away
To another universe
Where all the people say
It's the new-new place
For the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly
Wandered out of place
Take what you need
From the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown
You'll be floating higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling
But remember you can fly, high

Easy, ahh

And we're right here on a beautiful morning
In Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today
The kids are going to school, the grass is frosty
(This should be my)
 Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out
(Theme song)
 In the morning
(To life)
 Hello Cleveland
(Hahah)
 Yeah

A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
""Wonder what them folks on?"" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash, and you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him, unless he out on the road
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0
""Sir, you look high."" I know
But I prefer my eyes low

And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high

Yeahh, they say, ""Easy friend""
There he go talking about weed again
Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic
Stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining
Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling, Jack
Let's go

And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher

Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
Up in the hills, still keep it way triller than most
Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feels
I say that now until I go and pop this pill
I say out loud ""You wanna let me cop a feel?""
Now I don't pray out loud but I know that my god heals
Bounce with me, if you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up, won't let up, on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames, they love to speak my name
Sometimes dream of breakin' niggas whole faces
In front of the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases

I feel like Baby back in '99
In the SLS stuntin' and it's all mine
Shittin' on these niggas, sippin' on some Swiss Kriss
I got some jewelry on it, sittin' on my slit wrists
My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed
Work too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans
Don't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum
Haters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smiles
Just a grin that suggest I'm the best
Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
So many kids live their life through my rhymes
See, I'm in love with you all 'til the end
When shit was dark for me you were my only friends on the realer
So smoke some tree for your nigga
Ain't nobody got my bounce, know my juicy ounce
Walk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth

(Had-had no-no one), no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talk down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown
And now my Facebook poppin'
'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

Big homie, made the move
Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still (had no-no one), no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Think about my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We're getting money, mom

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all really knew about me
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all really cared about me
And none of y'all really cared about me
Now, guess what? I'm all you see, I'm all you see

This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world

Scott Mescudi vs. The World,Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager,2010.0,"What up, how is everyone doing?
You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some ""generation next"" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words
These are facts from a winner

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe we were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you

I can't be a loser, could've figured that
I can't be a lame, I'm cooler than that
I feel I love the fame, then I hate it back, hmm
Thinking now what I should be twitterin'
Why'd big bro take all the hot bitches?
Dear God, me too, I like the hot bitches
I'll be the underdog, all along, 'til I'm gone
I will live through a song, I'll be strong through the haters

Simple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who an older rapper's kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil' mama switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em

As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that

To the screw-face niggas, what you on?
Get off that, get a goal and focus dog
See, I'm what you need, you fiending now
Ask around and I bet you'll figure out
How to zone and control your future, wow
Yeah, I think I'm in the future too
I'm unlike fools who proceed to choose
To be like them, I be like who
I be like me, Mister K-I-D
S-O-L-O, D-O-L-O
See, the Lord adore me
He met me half way
""No guts, no glory""
I always say
So until I reach what I came here to find
Along with inner peace, life will always be a grind
One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be super-duper Scott
The one bad bitches called super-duper lame
Now super-duper fame gets me super-duper brains
86 the cape, but I'm super-duper high
Soaring past the moon, a super-duper lonely guy

Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in

For even in Hell I still have faith
To one day be free with my Father at the Gates
But make no mistakes, I'll show you what time takes
To be a success on Earth, mixed with all the hate
I stand on my pivot, my life, you could not live it
For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits
I provide my grind, mixed with no edits
They say they don't want me when I'm fucked up and forgotten
Until I rise up amongst the evils trying to stop 'em
Slow down, bitch, my money is what I'm clocking
I'm tick-tocking, once I start, I ain't stopping
Such bullshit that my soul deal with
When my room's dim lit, I pray to God to help with, uh
My endeavors, in any kind of weather
Hoes be pleather-fake, so I erase 'em out my sim
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide trying to read my mind
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide trying to read my mind

Gotta smack 'em with some shit before the world ends
Same old denims, wore 'em for days
I'm at home makin' jams in many wonderful ways
I see in many wondrous shades
Peekin' out the shadows at a new landscape
I've been trapped in my mind, I've been tryna escape
Fame and loneliness, the recipe for disaster
I can't handle this shit, I'ma get plastered
I just wanna go fast, I'm a bastard
I won't stop 'til I'm where I wanna be in line
And there's so many things to do in the in-between time
That's to say I don't get lost and lose my fuckin' mind
Thinkin' 'bout the days I was broke fuck me up sometimes
How did I do it, why the kids love me so?
'Cause they connect with Cudder, real simple
Now let me set the groove with some cello
From the outside lookin' in, shit is mellow
But sometimes I wanted to shoot my fuckin' face off
I'm talkin' game over, defeated the boss
Hope with age, I can cope with my rage
I'm so damn passionate, there's no safe plane
To chill or dwell in, I'm always in the zone
Why did God let Hell in? To test a nigga?
Man, listen, I'm tryna find a way to tuck this nina in my skinnies
It's kinda tough, I don't see how they did it in the '80s
My angels ride for me at all cost
My dad is tellin' me, ""Don't stress, go and floss""
""Live a little,"" I got you, pop

When I smash, wipe the smirk off they face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on, who gon' go half on a zone?

And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really 'cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished, no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga, these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted, look who the fuck it be

Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest

This is the story of the Man On The Moon",https://genius.com/Kid-cudi-in-my-dreams-cudder-anthem-lyrics

So when did we become so sophisticated and smart
And tryin' so hard that we forgot that we were animals?
But never her, I never heard a creature make such sounds
It never would occur to people her up-downs
Convertible, would murder evil, pup-pup hounds, just been doggin' her
Courtesy and real love found, just been dodgin' her
Mr. Man, misogyny hands been massagin' her
If she ran and blew up her town, shit, I would pardon her
Put a part in her scalp, scratch her dandruff
Put her heart in your hand, she throw a tantrum
Better let her get that shit off, bug repellent
Hell, they've been telling her ""Nah"" since forever
Harold Melvin and some Bluenotes all she know
Murder, murder, murder, m-murder all she wrote
Perverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat
All the dirty verdicts she learned watchin' soaps, yeah

Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? (Yeah)
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Semi-automatic with the passion when we makin' love
Never made it to the bed, sexin' on the living room floor
Now she on the warpath, homie probably best that you don't piss her off
Got this woman on the prowl, on the hunt, she gon' eat 'em all
And she know what she lookin' for, know what she lookin' for
She said she got herself some Louboutins, got herself some Louboutins
Not indecisive, indecisive at all
She know what she lookin' for, got her some Louboutins

Hit 'em like comic books

Into a girl's mind
Spit fine; no wine, dine
I keep two phones, sidekick for bad dimes
And a topical question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, ""He ain't even made a mill""
They say I'm complex just like the magazine
I wear my closet complex like the magazine
I get in their head
They don't even see my bread

Cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy
I keep 'em short and sweet, thick and petite
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme

Gotta explain every time I'm rhymin', (I be) I be

Some niggas sell CDs up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'

Ain't no city like Cleveland
Cruisin' with my bad bitch in the evenin'

'Till Day N Night, now they all got a clue who
Took me a minute man, took me a while
Hard headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child
But my ambitions made bitches beg for attention
DJ’s un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder
And I tried to tell my mother
But she ain't underdig, figure me on some other
But see my mommy 'ain't a fronter
So nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker

And, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless
We arranged some thing for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do
And, just when it seems that the game is hopeless
Rearrange some things for a dose of dopeness

That's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window
I'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon
And I'm livin' in hotel rooms
In the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth
How a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak
And how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big

Maybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book
But now I'mma play my Andre 3000

Dream on, dream on...
Hey...

These voices they tell me go
Why should I ever go?
Man I'm so comfortable here
Why should I head to a place where people live in fear?
Standoff-ish to really hear
Somethin' they can really feel
But see I'll never get
Why the earth is a puzzle that I'll never fit
I'm not of their world
So why should I leave my sanctuary?
Man, the whole thought of that is scary
How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out?
Will they understand I'm flyin' from a different route?
Posed as a human being
Mother Moon tells me that people need my help
I guess these other cards she threw out and dealt

She said I gotta do it alone
She said I gotta do it alone
I guess I gotta go

You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
It's bigger than you mane
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you mane

She said to pack my bags dog and never look back
This is something that I have to do
A hero to save the world
A hero with no girl or no family just sacrifice as a friend
And struggle is the enemy
But weed is the remedy
And if you get lonely boy you can just roll up a dutch and
Keep your head high
Wanna see home look at the sky
Remember you're not strange
But you are not the same mane

You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane

Yup

Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee; I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin it out, lost in the mood

There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood

No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin it out, lost in the mood

But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin mood

Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wild'n all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word

Done off for better and very celebratory
Fuck the blogs, I'ma tell my story

Doing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn

Rage, 'cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no more bitches playin' possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, want a woman with some toes
Optimos, takin' trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high
Go with your soul and try floatin' through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and Mimosas

Heaven at Nite,A Kid Named Cudi,2008.0,"Have you ever been to heaven at night? Night
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night

Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes, the feeling so right
At first you might see just one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils, you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night
Have you ever seen an ending so nice?
You feel so free, like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag
Models who smile, then tilt their head back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night

Have you
Ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night
Oh, have you
Ever been to heaven at night?

I need what the world can't give me
Can't give me

I'm wearin' Balmain thousand dollar pants
Wake up, bake up, then I'm in my Benz
Come to think about it, don't have many friends
Go to brunch by my damn self
Flirt with girls when they see my car
Fuck 'em when they see that I'm a star
Never ever open up or show my heart
It's the coldest winter in the summer, dawg
Many women, mothafuck 'em all
They just really want to train a dog
I'm a real nigga to the core
Off top baby girl further more
Pedal to the metal to the floor
On Mulholland while I'm hitting corners hard
Yeah I gotta hit them corners hard

I guess I'm just a lost cause
Just a skinny nigga with so many flaws
Starin' in that night, tight jawed
Fingers digging right inside my palm
Waitin' waitin' for the calm
Seem to think I know what's goin' on
I'm finally comin' alive
And it seems the ghost is movin' on

You know what that is? I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it
(Those guys didn't think I would do it, I told you I was gonna do it)

See, I could never have a desk job
My work take a nigga abroad
Meeting up late with foreign broads
Relaxing cause a nigga hustle hard
Man I gotta take a load off
Need a dime that'll take her clothes off
Took a trip out to Doha
Filmin' short films on a whim
Got dinner in a few with prince Sheikh
Kanye changed a nigga life twice
Gotta ride, gotta rep, ay
Getting rid of all the dead weight
Niggas really want me dead, hate
Not my fault I'm intriguing
Drinkin' and drivin': no weavin'
Pop a molly, feelin' ten again
Project X type weekend
Except a nigga damn near thirty
Like twenty one had never ended
Here I go with my second wind, bitch

I've been waitin' to shit on you

Lord help me out
Save my soul, need to find a new route
I don't even hear what other niggas talking about
Call me a hipster as long as you're a listener
Label me what you like
I'm close to my victory, dozed in the fight
When I open my eyes somehow seeing night
Beyond trying to see what being rich feel like
Six-figure checks, for my mom for peace
Everybody wants to stick on me like leech
Take my blood, give fake love, till I turn them down
I'm the one that who changed, bro?
Ask why I don't call cause when I was starving
You wasn't at all..around,now I gotta shut shit down
Be a man, pick friends, all selective now
You're cool, you're cool, fuck you
And to the bitch that's--oh yeah, fuck you too
Try to shine now everyone knows
Kid Cudi slipped up and loved them hoes
We all make mistakes, yes
No worries I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm, just my words and my stoner charm
With my dimples deep, I smile at peace
Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, missed not one step
And this is just the first step
God walks with me, but I'm still vexed

The Rage,Rampage (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),2018.0,"Hands up, we back in, 
born in the rage
Untamed, break free, beast out of the cage
Sky rainin' down flames, it's a war on the heavens
A beautiful scene in the night behind light
And much like that, when I'm dreamin', I'm in flight
Coast out of site, though I'm feelin' I'm not right
And Hell's got one hell of a grip, no shit
Your boy best not slip, get stuck in your grave
Just to live another day, fightin' through decay
Call on my angels and I kneel as I pray
Got my mind, my soul and my heart on the same wave
It took me a minute, now I'm all in it, damn
While I'm out of the dark, I push it to the limit, friend
So ready, I'm sharp, here comes the demolition man
Pack 'em up and just hittin', aimin' and never missin'
Servin' up the prescription, no time for intermission
Rippin'

Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know

The world's got hope in the city with a reward
Made for the pain, it's a battle I'm runnin' toward
Call to the don, I'm embracin' it to the core
Forced into fightin', get ready for many more
And I'm for mine from the jump, I ride or die with the pump
I'm squeezin' for that release, I aim and let it dump
I hear a roar of a sound, I'm feelin' it through the ground
Mayhem in the city, escapin' but I am found
I rise up amongst the many with no fear
Full squad, we at it, we finish 'em all, clear
Through the rubble, we rumble, never runnin' from trouble
Keep my head on a swivel, you know I'm scorin' for double
Searchin' for that release, swimmin' at it, repeat
Wash your hands of them sins and fightin' 'til we see peace
It's the least we could do in a world that needs the brave
Know the lost can be saved, survivin' the end of days

Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me

Highs N’ Lows,UnKnown,2008.0,"I be high when I split a dutch and fill it up
I be high when I get my money doubled up
I be high when a model wanna let me cut
I be high when I'm shinin' cause my diamonds blush
I be low when a nigga can't get away
I be low when I can't seem to make a way
I be low when I can't even feed myself
I be low when I realize I'm by myself
But I be high when I'm shopping for expensive clothes
I be high when I get what I couldn't before
I be high in the club while I'm poppin bub
I be high when I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs
But I be low at the shows in my dressing room
I be low when I see that I'm a different dude
I be low on the plane looking at the sky
I be low but my highs keep a nigga tight

I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

I be low when I gotta get ready for work
I be low cause after bills my pockets be hurt
I be low when I can't take a girl out
I be low cause they can't even figure me out
But I be high when the phony chicks show me love
Cause in my mind I read em' but don't give a fuck
I be high when a nigga get attention
I be high when ya girl catch feelings
Then I be low when I go into the empty space
I be low when I'm lookin' at a stressed face
I be low cause my brother face through hard time
I be low with my nigga ridin close behind
Then I'm high when I know the places we can go
I be high when I think of what the future hold
I be high when she ask for my room number
I be high but my lows keep a nigga humble

I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

I was high when the label said that I was dope
I was high in my eyes cause I had hope
I was high When I first had the taste of love
I was high when I left the city I was from
And I was low when I had a recent heartbreak
I was low cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low when I lost her over silliness
I was low cause she twisted what my words meant
But I was high when I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high when she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most
Highs and lows and succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...

I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

Rain,UnKnown,2011.0,"I hate when it rains
All I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking about the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinking about cash, nigga
I'm thinking about life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rainy days are a pain just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep somebody's looking through my window pane
Man, I swear I'm going catch em'
But maybe I'm trippin
Like Scarface, my mind's playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where Do is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong
I get scared of the day when the soul will be gone
The spoken words to thoughts, never be spittin' in vain
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading to change
Ask God if he feels my pain
And please, won't you stop the rain?

Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

Rain clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul on this earth was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears running down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain

Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantle
But I'm that boy to use to have the evil dreams
Now I realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somethin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!

I'ma Deal With The Rain

I Be High,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Uh
Yeah
Hello
Hey

I be high
When I split a dutch and fill it up
I be high
When I get my money doubled up, I be high
When a model wanna let me cut, I be high
When I'm shinin' cause my diamonds blush, I be low
When a nigga can't get away, I be low
When I can't seem to make a way, I be low
When I can't even feed myself, I be low
When I realize I'm by myself
But I be high
When I'm shopping for expensive clothes
I be high
When I get what I couldn't before, I be high
In the club while I'm poppin bub
I be high
When I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs But I be low
At the shows in my dressing room, I be low
When I see that I'm a different dude, I be low
On the plane looking at the sky, I be low
But my highs keep the rhythm tight

I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

When I gotta get ready for work
I be low
Cause after bills my pockets be hurt
I be low
When I can't take a girl out
I be low
Cause they can't even figure me out
But I be high
When the phony chicks show me love
Cause in my mind I read em' but don't give a fuck
I be high
When a nigga get attention
I be high
When ya girl catch feelings
Then I be low
When I go into the empty space
I be low
When I'm lookin' at a stressed face
I be low
Cause my brother face through hard time
I be low
With my nigga' ridin close behind
Then I'm high
When I know the places we can go
I be high
When I think of what the future hold
I be high
When she ask for my room number
I be high
But my lows keep a nigga' humble

I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
That's the story of my life

I was high
When the label said that I was dope
I was high
In my eyes cause I had hope
I was high
When I first had the taste of love
I was high
When I left the city I was from
And I was low
When I had a recent heartbreak
I was low
Cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low
When I lost her over silliness
I was low
Cause she twisted what my words meant
But I was high
When I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high
When she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most
Highs and lows
And succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...

I be high, then I be low, I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, but I be cool
This the story of my life, I be high
Then I be low, I be low, Then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight, no need to worry
This the story of my life

So plain it's almost like I don't even rap, yo
Mack load, with flame from a spawning of hauntings that aren't me
Even with my damn eyes open
Yeah, it's like my own never never land
Smokin' on kush, from a bush you'll never touch
Being approached by hoes before you couldn't fuck
And all they wanna know if you be down (you be down)
If you really understand what happen from point A
What, hey, how you doing it wasn't even enough
To escape but I can't go
See I dream on and I'm over the peons
While I be doin' the beyond the
Hatin' niggas be puzzled like how did he get on?
See, I did not dare perform with that coolery
So ante like nothing else matters
Walkin' with a spirit so tattered

You, you, you can look up, I never come down

New type of warrior
Modern day hippie if I get enough sticky
And if you don't get it I'll explain it to you simply
And iffy iffy, then homie probably never get me
Nothin' really special about lil' ol' Cudder
Except the fact I'd slit my own throat for my mother
If it could make it stress free and then my brother could sacrifice
A meal best served raw with a little steak sauce
Oh no, I bet you probably think I'm looney tune
After big big country bought an album from a leak through
He was cool but just seems some type whatchamacall
Other worldly, but I'm more of a worldly other
Sucker niggas like to state they undercover
But I'll peep ya, I'll see you from my cloud sanctuary
And there's something about Mary
She made me un-tame
There was issues way before I smoked the phillies

You, you, you can look up, I never come down

Expedited for you so homie run to it
We makin' the damn dough, who knew it
And everybody in the game with the same ol'
No-no's I'll be doin' it, but Cudi from a different mode
You can keep it goin' though, no I will never slow
Ol' girl want purp, she is silly, yo
I ain't trippin', I'm skippin' while I'm sippin' in
While I go in though (again and again)
Tell them motherfuckin' let somebody tell new ones
If you get high still strive to be someone
I am not a role model but I am the blueprint
Superstar concerts and honors when I spit
Only can be me, Scott, no one can do it, K
Only, I don't mean to be, I do it the CuDi way
No need to be mad if you not me

Head in another place no Myspace
Older dudes run around with guns on they hip
Berkely California man I got love for that shit
Everyday I stay awake cos I'm thinking when they coming
Old friends who grew up with
Really can't trust them
Man the cops is watching me
So you really can't bust him
Looking all through your emails
Reading your discussions
What's to believe they talking about illuminati
And the secret government that allegedly inside it
Man I'm sitting in my circle
Blowing blunts to the head
I'm just trying to live my life
And not in up jail or dead
Probation laws got me tripping all off the feds
All this was over funds and some motherfucking gas
While its people in the world who ain't got no fucking passion
I can see it in my rear-view
I'm finna break this glass

And people still in panic
What going on
I just don't understand it
Some people fake
And some of them underhanded
Some underrated
Most of them stranded
I wish life had a guide and came with a pamphlet
To show me where to go
And the things that is tragic
Who really knows what you doing everyday
And if you made the wrong moves that lead to your fate
And tell me about them asses
And how we eat in classes
The first time offenders
That's never given chances
And the people need justice
The one's living honest
You gonna get your time man
And they ever take my life man
I give you the promise
I did it for the love
Never for the dollars
Stay based for life
And minimize the losses
I realize that I'm a living prophet
We are gods

Skinny as a fuck, still eatin' the food

They linger ahead

Nor here, nor there, not really scared

Embrace bad with the good, keep doing the math

Super Boo,Dat Kid From Cleveland,2009.0,"Look at her she could be ma super boo
In a room crazy, sexy, cool
Intellectually sexy, her body is sick, her face is dope
Somethin like a eye candy photo
Hope to God the broad ain't a ho though
The way she walks is in slow-mo
Yep, ma mind got Tee-Vo
Every punk truck around
Plotting and scheming, wishing and dreaming
Jus for a little nano second to holla at her quick
Tryin' to holla for her name
Yellow bone with a tan like damn
Smile at me, so I smile right back
She move so effortless complimentin' her looks
I be commentin' up in her book

You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it

Mad views on her myspace shit
Just stoppin by, showing her love, while she sits
And all her friends are hot, but not like her she the number one spot
All I wanna do is really introduce Scott
Let her know my dreams and struggles to the top
Show her, that it feels good in a drop top
Rollin down sunset niggas can't stop
I can tell that she really got her mind right
Let me make that move when the time's right
Hope she don't mind a little limelight
You can't go wrong let's get right
And we gon let them other niggas stomp it out
Next step ye we gon' talk it out
I hop hotels 'til the next flight
I think about you cause your so right

Let me get it, okay I got it she's so hot move so erotic
Take her to Cancun fly supersonic
Grown and sexy love Gin & Tonic
Askin questions like where you from?
I ain't gonna tell you you should just come
Take that journey beyond the clouds
Let's leave reality truth be told
Yeh baby girl this the code
Come be ma roadie backstage at shows
I can tell that them other niggas did you cold
But am a hot nigga with the heat for sure

Know Why,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Wow this career is so so commercial
I would say no
More after school special
Another story about an unruly teen
Become a triumphant
More than what it seemed
All of the glorious things that he dreamed
Made the life that he saw seem so sub par
A star that was shooting didn’t seem too far
All he needed was some rockets on the side of a car
Maybe a little weed to intensify the scene
To provide a solid answer to the question “why I lean?’
A bonafide fiend that be taking by the beams of light
Man on the moon ain’t a name it’s a way of life
And this is why I got hated
Until I found myself and embraced it
Its something I denied
Why lie to my soul
Truth be told…

Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why (why)
I know you put me through it for a reason god

I’m just a dreamer
Turned true to life leaner
Born to do good
So others can be believers
Once had a lover, but I had to leave her
My life is much bigger
The plan I mean
Its all set in motion, the plan I’ve seen
Couldn’t figure out my purpose till the sky changed scenes
While them other niggas ride watching screens
I was getting off of work daydreaming all alone
Daydream till I’m home
In my bed in my zone
Nobody would call
Not a ring on my phone
Raps so boring
I can’t buy ringtones
I’d rather have the Nokia alert
I’m so gone
Man I’m never alert
But I feel so good
No more hurt
I’m whole completely complete
Rainy days completely delete
I see…

Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me

The stars, the stars, the stars

No big names. No big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Cool Beans though, 10 Deep Jeans ho
Stampede fitted in the range with a knitted
No gimmick: Real time, Real heart
Real words...Elegant: A piece of art
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga first couple songs, no guest appearances
Now you sick, mayne. I ain't takin stabs
I'm just taking names, then I'm kickin' ass
I'll never be retro like a Cool Kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
Me and my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Till we fed up and wet up Where niggas keep they swag
To the 'R'. Ruin niggas hopes of success
After LeBron, I'm what's next

Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars

Now I'm back on my grizzle, A plethora of strippers
I'm throwin around broads playing monkey in the middle
I'm curious Jorge, Fuck what dem whores say
Most of them is faker than the horse hair they forced in
I be in the club looking for a couple more of dem
Sorta like my first date. Fresher by the hullin'
I don't need your girl. Man I got a lot
They say he got a lot of whips, well I got A LOT
You can't unwind it. Rising and climbing
Ain't nobody brighter... I'm the man Winona Ryder
Lex Luger, narcissist, the mirrors get excited
The game is a store, Then miracle what I am
Maryland where I am, You niggas is behind us
There is not a list to find 'em
Anti-violent...Stylin, Lyrically inclined and

Call me ""World Wide Wiz"" cause I'm never home
Ever leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned

Trying to show their passion for ice
Instead of trying to show their passion for Christ
So until I get my world right homie I'm Jesus chainless
Waiting in the dungeon with the not many stainless
I'll be buckin at my demons
Truly for more reasons I couldn't put into words
Only assign melodies
If you ever hear a sweet sad sound
Those are the profound tones of
While I'm feeling lost, still waiting to found, down
Not by a model bitch, in her peace and Carey Anne
New motivation for the new generation
Born in 96' watching reruns of Fresh Prince
Inspiration come from all different angles
It is tangled in between
The bullshit that can claim you
Aye LeBron play this song before
You step on the court
This could your alley-oop
While you hop out the coupe
Never made it on the team
But I'm pimpin for sport
Ignorant to the fact I'm dying quick off this port
If any niggas set the goal for the sky to be the limit
You limit your role too stupid to even know
Damn son, what the hell?
We all need to think intergalactic
As I style as I smile
Finally after awhile, hold it now
They come around

Oh, will they come around?
Wonder if they'll come around, now
Oh, oh will they come around
Will they ever come around, now
Now come around

Call Me Moon Man,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yea the man and the myth
The whispers the gossip
Words from a chick
He oh so cute
And he down to earth too
You can call me Moon Man
And I'm just visitin'
No beyond the beats
To lyrics you are listenin'
Everything I am is probably everything they not so
You can call me Moon Man
I have no plan
I just landed here to approach those lames
With the weakest of ears
Stop livin' in fear
Even though shits eerie
No matter the cost
Motha fuckas will hear me
And I will out shine and out rhyme Those lames you don't cut it
Midwest cleveland niggas
Please M-Dub it?
You can call me Moon Man
To the haters who still puzzle
It's okay I'm a dog who still muzzle
But once I'm unleashed like Jet Li
I'm kickin' it
You can call me Moon Man
Like a tribe of questin
Supplyin like a radio hot line request on the radio
Somewhat mentally challenged like Radio
Can't fade me
Like a bad barber
It's new sound it's E pill
Take it at your own risk word to
 Emile
I don't know B that's the words of Patrick
You can call me Moon Man
Shit it so damn sick
No antibiotic can ever fuckin stop it
If you copped it
Please OD
You can call me Moon Man
If not for me please do it for music
I make immortal songs for the mortals to cruise with
For mortals to live with
Expand they realm
For my people free
Find peace in these
You won't be free
'Till you live on the stars
Shootin' by the moon
I'll be seeing you soon
But for now I'm away steppin'
Put me up in your away message
Word for word I keep rollin' on 'em
Rollin' on 'em

"Hi, I’m Scott (TEDx Talk)",UnKnown,2015.0,"Look at that handsome face!
Uhh! Okay. Just wanna check the mic first (?) get the sound right. This is not comedy hour, I promise.
The funny thing is: I used to go to this school. And my class used to sit like in this area, here. Yeah, O2, who’s an O2er?
Kendra, come here! Kendra, come on! Kendra (?) everybody! Come, give me a hug! I mean, how long has it been, two decades? Come up here! I was at all doing me. (?). How about that – reunion!
Okay. So, it’s just a little surreal, I haven’t been in this room since 1999, 2000 maybe. So, I’m 31, I just turned 31 on January 30th, how about that? Oh, thank you, thank you.
And, when I was approached to do this Ted Talk, I was immediately like: Why? And, then it was kinda like, put in perspective by me, in – I’m not really one to do speeches, I’m really weird, if you can imagine as I do the performing and I’m on stage, doing this is my job. It’s different to stand up in front of people like this when there’s this light and speak and, you know, express yourself in this way.
But, I told myself, okay, how am I gonna be able to do this, let me just talk about my life. That’s something I know, better than anyone else. And, I feel like coming from Cleveland, coming from Shaker, you know, such a diverse place, and just looking in the audience from the people I can’t see, it’s still … very diverse. But, I believe that my upbringing in this town, the school, district, is what made me the man I am today.
And when I moved away when I was 20 years old, my mom was extremely sad – where’s my mom at? Yeah. She was crying. Hey Mommy. My first big fan was my mom. And, it was really interesting, I remember leaving home, and she’s giving me a hug at the airport, and she leans and she goes: “You can always come back around, you can go right back home, you can change your mind, everything will be fine.” I’m like: “No, I’m going, this is happening.” And you know, walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: “Ohhh...” And me just being like: “Errr…”
However, as soon as I turned back around, I knew I was on a mission, on this very specific quest. You know? It was bigger than just wanting to be a musician, or do movies. It was about: Finally showing the world what Scott could do. I wasn’t the best student, I’mma be honest with you, Kendra knows this. If Kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me I probably would have tried to cheat off her.
But that’s not the point. The point is, it’s like: When I think about it, you know, I wish I applied myself as much as I applied all the energy into music as I did, as in music as, you know, as in music, I wish I could have applied that same energy into my academics when I was in school. So a lot of people look at me now and they go: “Oh man, this must be dope to be a rapper.” And it is dope, it’s awesome. (?)
But, you know, I can’t say that I don’t wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. I can’t say I don’t feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. You know, and these are things that I think about, you know, cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh – I was gonna curse but – wearing fresh clothing. And being popular. And, when you go out into the real world, you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. High school, you know. Now I remember Kendra (?), but everything else I don’t remember. No I’m just joking. But I’m just saying: At that moment in life you feel like that’s all that matters. High school, it’s like: Oh this girl doesn’t like me, this guy here and there’s all this drama, this drama, and you go into the real world and you know it’s about just trying to make your mark in the world. And I never got the chance to do that academically.
So I had this fire, I had this fire to pursue this musical career. I had no idea how to go about it. I was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. Older uncle. So when I moved to New York it’s not he could show me around, show me all the cool spots, you know, he was just kinda like: “There’s the train and you get a metro card, and you go.” And I was: “Yeah okay, we got the Rapid, I can do this. It’s all right.” I was immediately wrong for that, for assuming that it was gonna be the same. It is not the same.
Um, but, I embraced it. I embraced the fear, the danger. I enjoyed the fact that I was going in uncharted territory. It was like a sense of wonder for me. And, I can’t say I was one of those people that was into like having thrills and, you know, getting some type of stimulation from that, but it was nothing like saying, like: “Y’all I’m gonna out and pursue something and I know I’m gonna do it. And nobody’s gonna tell me I can’t. And everybody that doesn’t believe it I’mma prove it to ‘em sooner or later. And that’s just what it is.” Because I won’t point I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to pass that test. Or I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to go to this college.
But with music it was like: Nobody’s gonna take that from me. You know what I’m saying? Because it was things that I was dealing with as a youth at this school that I didn’t talk to people about. That probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. You know? And with music, it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that I’m not that crazy. That there’s other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely, dealing with suicide, things like this.
And, it was one of those things that, you know, I just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever, who supplied that trip financially, first couple of months or whatever. Um, to have the support of my home town, I can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy, you guys got me really nervous, my palms are sweaty. But, um, it’s really just the clock, it’s like: 11 minutes, 24 seconds, 23 seconds, 22 seconds … It’s like what’s gonna happen when that clock’s over with? It’s like somebody gon’ just pull me off stage? Geez.
Um. But um, really, I, first thing I did when I went to New York, and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure – it wasn’t. It was pretty much finding a job. And for the first couple years I was working everywhere. You know, whether it was like at this clothing store here, or Abercrombie & Fitch, or American Apparel, or Dean & DeLuca, I always had a job. I was a hustler. And, you know, I still apply that same work ethic with the music.
You know what I mean, like, I’m almost in a way don’t know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. You know what I mean? And, I think that, when people ask me: “Man, how do you do it”, you know, I’m just kinda like: “I don’t know, like I was just … focused?” You know? Because it’s hard to put it into words because I can’t say that it’s just something I flipped, a switch I just flipped when I turned 20. Like I was always this guy.
You know, I was always outspoken and creative and artsy, I used to draw when I was a kid, it was before all the musical stuff came along. I was an artist. You know, I used to draw all my stuff, I used to draw all my tattoos and I said: “Oh when I get 18, I’mma draw, I’mma get these tatted.” It was about being a cartoonist up until I was like 15. And then I just wanted to be a rapper. And then it was all uphill from that.
But, you know, … if I could really just give people one piece of advice, you know, and it just passes along, and one thing I want you to take from this, is that like, we are all the commanders of our own destiny.
You know what I mean?
It’s like you see these movies where they say, like that one movie with … Lucy, where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. You know, and you realize that the average human doesn’t use at … two, three percent. You know what I mean? Some weird small percentage like that.
I really just told myself from jump like: “Hey man, I’m gonna do this, and I apply the information that I needed to execute that and in places, times of my life where I didn’t have the answers, I make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information.” You know what I mean? You can’t hang out with people that ain’t doing nothing. How you gon’ get money, hanging around with people that ain’t got no money? You know what I’m saying?
Like, how you gon’ be inspired by people who aren’t at least trying to go the same way, at least, whether it’s music, or schooling, like I would be inspired by all my friends, cause, I went to college, I went to University Toledo for one year for film – it sucked, I hated it. You know, it wasn’t for me. But my film class, my film classes were amazing, um, and now that I’m doing acting, producing shows, writing shows, I wish I wrote that whole couple, three more years out, cause I would have information that I needed, and I wouldn’t have to go through so many hoops, to be able to direct or create my own film or TV show. Um, I don’t know why I said that, let me get back on track … Okay.
So, um, really, you know, people, like I say, come up to me all the time and they like: “Man but you did it man, you’re special, you’re different” – and I’m not. Any different. From you, you – we’re all the same. I came from this town. I went to this school. All my buddies, we all had the same opportunities, you know? It’s kinda just like: Having that self-confidence. You know? And it was a lot of areas in my personality where I wasn’t as confident. You know? Definitely with the chicks. Early on. I don’t know if Kendra knows this.
But the music, me doing something, where I was like: “Wow, I made this!” Like my first album, when that came out, I was like: “Wow! I made this, this is something that I put all my energy into, and it’s out and it’s released to the world on a professional level.” I was so proud of myself. But: “Let’s do it again.” I didn’t have time to be like: “Yeah, my first album, yeah, yeah, people like it”, it was like: “Okay, we did good, it didn’t suck, what are we gonna do again, we gotta do another one.” And then I did that one: “Okay, people like it, let’s do a third one.” You can’t get caught up in just all the other things, you know, I really was like, even still to this day, I have my front, but it’s focused, you know, it’s never, you know, even when I do straight, I’m still working. I’m still writing a song, I’m still doing something. I’m persistent.
You know, um, and that’s also another part, you know, I believe that some people get lazy. Some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. Because they get caught up in their head and it’s: “Oh, I can’t do this, maybe I can’t do this.” It’s like sticking to something. One goal at a time. You know, that was like, that’s still big for me. I never put too much on my plate. You know, at first it was like the music, and then the acting kinda came into play, early on, and I, it was unexpected, but it was a blessing, that I was prepared for. I was like: “Man. I’ve been a class clown since forever, let’s do this.” And I used to do it for free, now I’m getting paid for, this is great. Um, so, you know, I’m glad you guys like my jokes, I’m not even a comedian, this is just…
Um, so, you know, just kinda fast forward cause it’s so much I’m tryna squeeze into 5 minutes, 56 seconds. Um, but, you know man, there are a lot of haters, there are a lot of doubters, there are a lot of people that would telling me: “Man you ain’t gon’ do that.” “That’s not gon’ happen.” “He’ll be back.” I would tell all my buddies: “I’m moving to New York” – “All right! You’ll be back!” Nah. Nah. I’m not coming back. And if I do come back, it’s for a concert. You know? And everybody be like: “Alright, whatever.”
And when I came back it was for a concert. It was for a concert, and it was the most beautiful homecoming I’ve ever had. It’s no show more important than this show. And I’m not just saying that because it was like: In Cleveland, and it’s like, my home town. It was the first time I saw my peers, friends I went to school with, being proud of me. I didn’t get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. I didn’t get the cap and gown. You know what I mean? I didn’t get the chance to see these guys because I moved to Solon, 11th grade. It’s like even seeing Kendra is wild, because I haven’t seen anybody in so long. Um, but, that’s the beautiful moment, still to this day, I do shows and I see a class mate in the crowd and I forget my raps, I’m gonna: “Oh … oh … happy, you got any kids, I’m sorry, I gotta …”, you know? It’s wild. You know?
And, I didn’t get that at school. I didn’t play on the football team – I tried, but I was terrible. I didn’t play on the basketball team – I tried, but I was terrible. I didn’t wrestle. I tried – no, no. I did try. But I tried outside of the Shaker Heights High School, in another district in Cleveland Heights, where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. It was kinda just like: “Okay I try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in Shaker will know about it – cause it’s in Cleveland Heights, they’re just talking over there.”
But my point is also like music was my plan G. You know, it wasn’t like I didn’t try anything else, like I tried everything else. I tried everything I thought, you know, was a traditional thing a young boy should do – sports, you know, and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where I thought it was my own destiny, but also I wanted to make my mom happy. You know? And sometimes guys, we gotta do that. You know, there’s a lot of things that we don’t wanna do stuff, but it’s like, man, like, your parents (?), they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. And you know it’s like, and now I’m at 31 and I’m just like: I have to apologize to my mom, was it like seven years ago, I was like: “Mom, I am sorry.” Like: “I was a nightmare. But we got money now, so let’s just go like…” And we’re okay. We’re good now.
Um, and it’s funny, too, cause I took my mom to get her first tattoo ever, I forced her to get a tattoo, and it’s so funny, cause she – are you, are you embarrassed, I’m sorry. But this is big, you know, because our relationship from the kid I was at high school, it’s the best it’s ever been. You know, I used to put my mom through hell. But, she was my supporter. And that’s what parents are there to do. To give you the devil’s advocate, even when, I’m not gon’ say, every time I told my mom I was moving to New York, she was like: “Pff. Okay. Aight.” You know, but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world, more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you don’t wanna see you win.
Parents care. Now I got a four-and-a-half-year-old, she’ll be five in march. She’s the apple of my eye. She’s my little baby. And, she’s so funny, you know, cause, I’m the one who gets emotional when she has to leave, you know, and I’m kinda just like, when she’s leaving, I’m like: “You know I’mma miss you, right?” And then she’s like: “Yeah.” And I’m like: “You gon’ miss Daddy?” – “Yeah.” “Oh my … You know you can call me and stuff, when you miss me? And I’m just sad you’re leaving.” She’s like: “It’s okay. We always come back.” And I was just like: “That’s what I’m saying, all that, that’s why I’m crying, I’m so emotional!” But it was just like beautiful to just see, you know like, me be the parent now. You know what I’m saying? And to see that confidence of my child, and the same confidence I gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: “Okay.” Cause I literally like follow my daughter’s lead. I mean, I just, whatever she is telling me to do, I just follow whatever she – well I mean, obviously not in every way. Or else like, I would be broke, but … in some ways I do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.
But, that’s the beauty of life y’all. You know what I’m saying? I used to come in this room, I used to sit right in that section. Sometimes I’d pay attention – sometimes I wouldn’t. Most of the time I’d be checking out chicks. Some chick I probably never talk to cause I never had the confidence, maybe if a – what’s the day that we would send carnations, Kendra? Valentine’s Day. That wasn’t a joke. I was the king of like, sending, like, carnations to chicks that I never talk to. I would be asking my mom for like: “Mom, can you give me five bucks, you know it’s (?) today, I wanna (?).” And, she would just be like: “Okay”, you know? Not knowing that I was buying carnations for all these chicks, you know, but, thanks for supplying that, Mom.
But, with 23 seconds left. I just what y’all know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls, it’s scary, but like, if you believe man. You know? I you believe. And if you want it. And if you wanna work hard enough for it. You can be so. Cause it’s no difference from me and you. I just really wanted this shit. I wanted it bad. You know? And I didn’t want to be a failure. And nobody’s a failure in this room. Don’t ever think that. We can all win. And that’s it.

JFKPSA,UnKnown,2015.0,"The artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility Against an intrusive society and an officious state
He has, as Frost said, a lover's quarrel with the world
In pursuing his perceptions of reality
He must often sail against the currents of his time
This is not a popular role
Yet in retrospect, we see how the artist's fidelity has strengthened the fibre of our national life
If sometimes our great artists have been the most critical of our society
It is because their sensitivity
And their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist
Makes him aware that our Nation falls short of its highest potential
I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist
If art is to nourish the roots of our culture
Society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him
We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda, it is a form of truth
For poets, there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style
In free society art is not a weapon and it does not belong to the spheres of polemic and ideology
The highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself
And to let the chips fall where they may

I'mma have one disappointed mama, no!
I'mma have one disappointed fam, I'mma feel bad
That I can't provide for my fam
I can't help how my mom process
Mr. Hutch told a nigga ""young, learn to be the best""
And if I can't do that mayne, what the fuck I'm living for?
I got a pack of Newports and a super-bad whore
I step out and I drink a lot of Hennessey
Battle in my sleep with the demons tryna ruin me
A bunch of discouraging words, saying that fame wasn't meant for me
Take it back to Cleveland, you heard?
I can't stop them from speaking
Their visions are intense, got me laid out leaking
Y'all don't know the half, kid cudi got issues mentally
That I scribble down fast, like
I won't fold, I can't fold
I won't fold dogg, I can't fold
Is what I say to myself over and over
Cruising through the city in my black Range Rover

Heard em' whispering, I heard them talking now
Now that I'm bubblin'
Thought I forgot how you
Tryna take me off my grind
Yup, yup, they tryna take me off my grind
But it's my time, boy
We going straight to the top
Watch me live, my nigga

When you making moves, everybody pounding you
But when you down and out, niggas won't acknowledge you
Sick to the stomach when I think about losing, but
I like this music, so this the life that I'm choosing..
I had to find out who the real Scott was
Meditated with the wolves, all focused to get my hunger back
So alone, just me and an instrumental
They say my music ain't normal
Must be something up with my mental
I don't spit about guns and drugs
Well dumb fuck I don't know about guns and drugs
I spit what I know, and you should too!
But you won't, we all know, you wanna jock the next dude
And you follow the next man
Well I was born to be a leader so you know that I'mma follow my heart fam
And I'mma roll with what my nigga Manny said
""Keep your individuality because that's what's gonna get you bread""


I ain't tryna make hits for the club no more
I'm just tryna make hits for my niggas at war
Day to day in the White Man's World
Getting head from the white man's girl, that's me

Having dreams of a dark-skinned chick with big breasts
While I'm thinking of steps to be king, just like in chess
Kid Cudi won't rest, that's when I'm at my best
Flow's good ? I see the rest mayne
A lot of cats tryna make it happen through the music
Truest thing about it is not everyone can do this
Gotta spit it different from another nigga living
If I ain't, I'm slippin

Rain day,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah

I hate when it rains... all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinkin about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rain dayz and the pain, just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebodys looking through my window pain
Mane, I swear I'm going catch em' but maybe I'm trippin like scarface
My minds playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong I get scared of the days when the soul will be gone
It's spoken word but thoughts never been spittin in vein
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading the change, ask God if he feels my pain
And please would you stop the Rain...

Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain

Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul, on this earth, was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things
Rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain

Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Can Feel My Pain

Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantel
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somthin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!

Hm, hm, hm (
What it is?

While I cough up this blunt, I sit back in the cut
All my niggas ridin' with me, more excuses to stunt
And we pull  up the cup, and we fill up the Woods
Loud plane, got this plug, and the rest lookin' good
Get your girl off her, hey, said she ready to play
It's all a game, it's all a game, and I'm doin' my thang
More rage, more rage, black Porsche in the rain
Someone stop me, bitch, get off me, man, my life ain't the same
Natural killer, once I'm done feelin' their pain
Now it's like I'm on my Sepeher and I'm feelin' them games
Let dude hum it back, man, that's a wrap
Can't keep a nigga down, down, baby, that's a fact
And I rep it, Cleveland City, runnin' through my veins
To BK, East New York, and I never change, and I -
Keep my niggas close, just like i'm supposed
'Cause this is for people, to dance to what I wrote, uh-huh

And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want

Cruisin’ (In the Evening),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(x2)
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

I've been drinking all night, but I'm cool to roll
Red lights, stop at 'em very slow
Playing, ""Feel So Good"" by Mase
I got three chicks, one in the back, it's never up
Two chicks up in the front with me
They love the midwest accent thing
So I'm steady on my game talk
Steady on my good side
Love the Cleveland swag
Doors swinging, we some clowns right?
Girlies all around as we pull up to the Mirage
And I just open up the doors on 'em
Cudder lean got 'em in my Bathing Apes
Got 'em all intrigued
All I can do is just smile and wave
Cause that's how it be, when you paid

I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

Now the mood is good, the champagne's flowin'
And she's feeling me, I'm digging where we goin' (and uh)
After the club we headed straight to the IHOP (the IHOP)
But I'm sipping slow, trying to remain at ease
Waving my hand, doing my dance at peeps (what it do)
Me and my leaners we gon' party and all that, and all that (and we will)
So we gather on a zip, my shit rock
I rap hard, Kid Cudi got that mean mean, the crackheads
Hoes look who when I whip whip the cutlass, the cutlass
So I can't even trip because I love it when I'm ridin'
That Cleveland city whip appeal I need it I ain't lyin'
I love it just as much as model girls and Hennessy cognac
And it's all that, so I be

I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

(Cudi man we gotta tell 'em how we do it in the NY)
Hey hey, yeah your boy stay fade
Higher than you sire, yes that's how I stay
About to blow fast you could call it Minute Maid
But I've never been that minute man I'm in it to amaze
Cudi killed the track, the flowers in the vase
Dude so cold you could put him in a grave
Here with some leaners
Dude's washed up, you could call us the cleaners
About to see home boy, sitting in the Beamer
With a dime chick cause she love my demeanor
Cudi, that's my buddy
He get a full discount, nigga just like a senior
Floatin', smoking on that funky cold me-haze
You see, we cruisin' like the Nina and the Pinta
Crack the Dutch, got light green with magenta
I'll show ya how to do this
Yes I'm the instructor
Come ride with a nigga cuz I'm the conductor

Get It In,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hot damn, I am the man, I don't even need a scheme
I don't need a planI just say ""Hi"" then grab her hand
Told her I'm a dog with a birch to relax him
Say she want to window shop, I just laugh
Girl thought I was trickin', baby that's just sad
I pop so many tags, like I give grab bags
So when they see me, bitches do the mad dash
He will motion approaching up in the slab
Drink and smoking when they come to the pad
She just looking at me cuz she know I wanna smash
Eyes on my pockets now she checking out for my stash
Now this is the part where personalities clash
I subtract her then a nigga must add
I just need another to be ahead of the class
Cudi McLovin bitch I'm Superbad

When they street or see me in the club (in the club)
All the girls always wanna show me love

Just young nigga on my motherfuckin' grizzle
Other cats simple but your boy Cudi sizzle
Got your main line when I'm all up in the middle
All because of my songs, all because of riddles
That is amusing to me cuz I'm the niggy
All these women they all so pretty
Which one I need? Which one I want?
The one that like drinkin' and good rolling blunts
I had one chick she called herself Tila
She was so hood kept a chrome nina
When I first met her we was over on mulas
Said she was interested on getting on some new cock
She was so cool jumped right in my coupa
All of this ? Tila threw my a loopa
Gave me neck while I gripped up on the wheel
Eyes looking at me like :""Cudi how it feel?""
I'm probably the coolest motherfucker ever rappin'
Next to Snoop Dogg and Devin the Dude
When I touchdown I won't clown and do the Deion
I'mma keep winning because the rest of them are peons
Plus I'm a fool for gold, so I'm shinin'
Ferris in a bimmer, sittin' back reclinin'
Back in the day bitches told me ""Dream on!""
Now at the shows in the front screaming ""Lean on!""
Ain't that something? (Haha haha)
Ain't that something?

When they street or see me in the club (in the club)
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in

Mr. K.I.D.,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Yea, yea, cle-cleveland style!)

84 Kid Mesc was born
On my own since they cut the umbilical cord
When I was born, witness to divorce and scorn
Ever since that happened, I was daily torn
Didn't understand nothing but I'm happy
Instead of being cool, my family kept on snapping
Cool out shit 12 a nigga was rapping
My father died, the pain is still
Look in the mirror man, I see real
Touch my reflection, feels what I feel
The letter is written: stamped and sealed
Intoxicated, spill for spill
And I ain't never seen a gang making deals for deals
Cover my mind and witness why
There's the time in the world and no time to die

I ain't trying to upset nobody
I'm just trying to be me
Everywhere I go man, people like ""he's still rapping?
Yeah that's right man, you still gun clapping?
I'm on to bigger positive things
Trying to live out a dream
I'm the MVP, look at my ring
What y'all know about the street games, you're just
Dreaming em up. Not trying to make a come-up
Going to sleep at night praying to god
Wishing that you had that bad bitch in your arm
I'm that kid tryna make things happen
Up in the club, watching gangstas clapping
And I'm that kid that be steady rapping in the booth
Throw out my demo and that's a Hot 97 proof
And you don't wanna sign me, fuck are y'all on?
I go next to the next dude that wanna put me on
And that's real, cause I'm only me
The K-I-D, not trying to become the next OG

Relax daily 
Ya know what I mean, less acting
More me and me, less them
In the pool of magical ones, I will not swim
Not on the hottest day or the warmest night
I'm free like a bird nigga, I should take flight
Plain nigga, the one less hoes like
Even if I had jewels that could dim light
Off they would never look, rather read a book
Know I'm semi-wrong, got 'em shook
Now they know Scott, and they know I plot
Don't trust hoes, they just want the knot
Till I abuse it, baby I love music, not
Really ain't no question, just lessons
At confessions, never false preaching
Real recognize through deception and lies
So, keep it music, baby keep it going steady
It won't be long, my niggas, till everybody witness",https://genius.com/Kid-cudi-mr-kid-lyrics

No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga, first couple songs, no guest appearances
No big names, no big chains

I'm just taking names then I'm kickin' ass

"Drake Diss, “Money, Cash, Hoes Needs to be Deaded” [Arsenio Hall Appearance]",UnKnown,UnKnown,"I think the braggadocio--the money, cash, hoes thing--needs to be deaded. I feel like that’s holding us back as a culture, as black people; it doesn’t advance us in any way, shape or form. We’ve been doing that same thing for years now, it’s like like, what, four decades of the same old . Sorry for my language. And I feel like, you know, if you’re gonna be an artist, there’s a time when you just have to embrace the responsibility and understand that the power of music is something so special, and to be able to do in on this magnitude where you reach millions of people, it’s like why not use that for good, why not tell kids something that they can connect with in their life.
And really, my mission statement since day one - And I'm getting so worked up talking about this. All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone and stop kids from comitting suicide. *Applause* Thank you.
And I'm never trying to be political, and I'm actually like shaking, I can't believe I'm saying this, but- *Arsenio interrupts*
Arsenio: Those two specific things, where does that come from?
Cudi: Well, I've dealt with suicide for the past 5 years, you know? Like, it wasn't a week or day that didn't go by where I was just like ""You know? I want to check out"" You know? I know what that feels like, and I know it comes from loneliness. I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself. And these are things that - you know, kids don't have music that can coach them and give them that guidance.
I didn't have that. I had to listen to Jay-Z and take certain things from it and the other shit, I just didn't know what he was talking about. *laughter* And like, now I'm 30  and I'm like, ""Oh! that's what Hov was talking about, I get it now""
But what about the kids who- you never really had an artist where you connected with them all across the board. And I think that that's my job, I'm just really trying to guide people and help people, cause loneliness is a terrible, terrible thing man, and if you don't know how to conquer it, it can eat you alive.
Arsenio: How are you right now?

Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man (Midwest action)
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man (Midwest action)
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man

Never
Fold for nah nigga
Understand me, raps is intact
Like a perfect blunt rap, I take that
And getcha contact on my lyrical poetry
I rip shit down
 when I run around
Tryin' hold me back from greatness
I shake them quicker than puppets can do any man
Fuck them, I just stick with my mission, control
Niggas is clowns
Niggas wanna hold me up
Like security in an airport
Should I board now
Y’all got me wrong
Cause I'm dripping like the H1 documentaries, man
Who can fuck with me now?
Cudi ain't a fucking gimmick
 and vivid, baby don’t hold back
I live it, I breath it, won’t fade out
I spit fireball straight from my mouth
Bitches love my style

Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

Homie
You ain't even gotta know me
Kill the raps and tracks
Get them buried in a hurry
Drink out beats, with the heat, just like a Honda
Keep rap hard, and my guards up
So doggy, what’s good?
Keep flowing just like a waterfall, faucet
Breaking niggas down like a brick
I toss it, jerks tellin’ fairytales
What would they dwell, say oh well
Most niggas are lame
I don’t even have time 
Like bananas that pick up they brain
I show you the big pick up in the frame
I’m bringing the flame, I’m bringing the heat
Lame niggas duck down
Cudi apocalypse now
I get around like 2Pac 
Niggas tongue-tied like nights, I take flight

These flows’ll melt ya

Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas

Simp
Get the guards attack
Kick niggas in the grill like 
Get ready for ace like a fine wine is made
Metaphorically speaking the flow
Niggas is slow
And I know
, run it back
But fuck that, take it to the hill off
 a nigga was built
MVP’s and  possibly, yeah
I be the one
Got the glow like Leroy Green
Directing your feet, son
Cudi hot shit, son
People be dumb as rocks cause Cudi was born a rock
And all they say is “Cudi rap, bitches and panties gon' drop”
No...
Nigga understand my mind
A nigga will see, homie understand my grind
 and just to see the cash money
Life attempts to estop Mesc
My niggas know me, know me
Scott nigga!

Man
It's just the Midwest Action
The real diller tiller on the beat
Yeah
Let's go
Let's beat this motherfucker

Cudi in the spot, all the lames ice-grillin'
Mad cause their girl call me Mr. Nice-feelin'
Must stay clear from the sneaks to the fade
I ain't even in the game and the nigga look paid
Cockroach niggas get sprayed with the Raid
No time for the drama, tryna get laid
Sippin', my mellow, Kid Mesc lady killer
Yo girl, I'm a fill her like gas to the tank
Nice skin, college girl, wanna come to Scotty's world
Like to wear it straight, wanna cut her hair like 
I wanna pop, but you're a bad bitch
Says she a magician, wanna show me tricks
Told her I'm a beast in the sheets and the booth
Says she ain't believe me, need to see some proof
Pulled out my demo, then pulled out a condom
Told her let's go, while we listen to my album

I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high

Met a older ho, birth name 
 this nigga had a dealer
All the motherfuckers run game just to keep it
But the bitch 
Ya boy had to delete it
I said: These are the things I'm on
Niggas see the potential, wreck shit King Kong
Beat bot tiller, he a beat Godzilla
I'm that nigga, boy boy, told you before
Screwed up shit in the deck and move slow
Got a neck from a chick and neck move slow
Perform on stage, hoes in the front row
They try to take that like i was Sean Combs
Bitch get down
You need to go home or you get dick down
I use slump, let the base line thump
And it bumps and it thumps that all the cops get mad
I chill cause I'm ill, up in the game all smacks
The races for cake, doing a hundred meters dash
Sit back and I laugh, cause these others are jokes
They might just get slapped and those will get choked

I'm that boy
I'm that

I spit high, high

Shed A Little Light,Rap Hard,UnKnown,"Wake up in the morning same shirt same jeans
Wishing of the rich life, I roll when I lean
Not knowing what that life or that day bring
Wonder what if the light shines bright what if i can't see
If I do what I do to get through, then that's what I'mma do
Pure focus when I spew, having been in a pew for some time now
But that don't necessarily mean I'm hell bound
Stuck in my ways, hoping better days come through the cracks
Every day same thing: eat, sleep, shit, rap
Then shake it, mice running round my damn sticky trap
Ants on the plates and food, rapping the only thing cool
My mood chilling in my staring up at the ceiling
Nigga my life day to day is lord willing
The dry wall pillars metaphors for my feelings
Yeah, starting a new life no more drug dealing nigga

Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream

When I was younger I told myself I wouldn't smoke
That was the biggest joke
I'm addicted to these ports like they're pure coke
I'm selling this journey out with no real route
World thought I wanna go, all I really know is that I'm making moves
Whether it's robbing fools or making people groove my nigga
You know I'm choosing something
I remeber getting older and not caring 'bout nothing
All I knew was that I had a destiny; that was my sixth sense
I grind with six cents, and spent six years of rap
I'm hungry, Chris just made it happen
You know Mescudi, I was tired of being
Picture this; two bedrooms and four siblings
I slept on the couch for 14 years of my life
Finally copped him a bed in the living room it's alright
Let me shed a little light, I'mma crawl out the dark
And I'mma grind till the end till my life's cut off nigga

Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas

Even though my friends looking at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just picked thy new nigga
Feel cats talking like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from: CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like Sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time, make s'mores
But if I wanna plow something like a snowblower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye Don C Jigga man
Been represent since I met Quince and I get style tips from my homeboy Vin and
Com is the homie
Really doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what up Gwan
I go monkeypaw on the record and they think I'm cuckoo
Niggas is sounding dated like they recorded in FUBU
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words, man
'Til you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow, man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can't erase
Or eat what's on the devil's plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In London with Hudson
And them girls want some cutting
I'm with him so I'm cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I'm pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roaming
AT&T is on bullshit man I wish they'd stop fronting
But when I roll back to Brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
They say homie keep rappin'
I say homie it's nothing
Now when I roll back to Cleveland
Hit the store for a philly
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
Cause them young niggas feel me
When I roll out to Cali
Hit the store for a Swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin'

Asher: My shit is like this when people walk in
We do this, we do that, we do rock, we do rap
We do jazz we do funk and then classical
With a clash to Outkast, back to Johnny Cash
Flash from Black Thought and A Tribe Called Quest
Les from Primus, Mos Def and Kweli
Zepplin, Onyx, Beck, and Chuck D
Feelin' of Bob Dylan, hints of John Lennon
Mixed with a bit of Pimp C and Bun B (Woah!)
Marley in my heart with parts of Charlie Parker
Mozart's art and all of Shawn Carter
Bjork to Tom York, Europe to New York
Morrison of The Doors, and Morsel of Too Short.(hey!)
In short this list is long and just goes on, y'all
Me and Cudi, we unstoppable!
Cudi:
Yeah, I be freshman, next in
Kickin' up the dirt and they be blessed then
When you come arrest him, we'll be out, in minutes
I don't give a fuck what bail-bondsman are spittin'
I'mma let y'all niggas know they well wishin'
Kid Cudi fall off? Never bossy, I'm getting money
Bounce all around the world; similar to bunny
Rabbit, you want my dick? Come grab it
I will break skull, motherfucker
Kid Cudi's in the mall poppin' tags and I'm duckin' 'em
Everytime they try to play the games, all the model girls claim
That they runnin' round town and they fuckin' him
No, they ain't fuckin' with him, no, not on that level
I never love the hoes, cause a nigga got several
I'm not tryna be caught up, like I'm
In this, movie that you, know
I'm not tryna be up in court
Baggin' all these hoes, no nigga
I am just trying to sit back and smoke my kush
You want doobie? No, what you know is hit the puss
You wish you weird, nigga, my nigga, Asher Roth
We the motherfucking bossiest of boss
What you know about that, boy, yes the ball I will toss
Asher:
Yeah, and this is it, down to this
To the nitty gritty, my finger nails as dirty as any, but anyway
We slice it, it's goin' against me, fightin' to show 
I'm tryin', but no one lets me I'm tired, so don't upset me
Cause I'm, tryna fight with both arms tied behind me
With a blindfold on, throwin' shots at my body, but I
Continue on like I carried the cross
Stroll past the crossroads to the land of the lost
And then, skip right to Satan, throw some penny's at his feet
Say I'd give him my soul, but I sold it to the industry, so
Not up to me, attached a couple of strings
And before decisions made I'm in different directions
It's nothin' but reps and, record execs and
You and the next man go get your investments, cause
Now more than ever, I'm hot with hostility
It's now or never and never's never a possibility
Cudi:
If you'd listened to Day'N'Nite in reverse
You'd probably think I was suicidal, with the knife in the bible
I don't give a fuck with niggas sittin' back and so idle
I'm that nigga, I'm you'r father, get in your room and study
I'm that nigga in the back, you can call me your buddy
Cause I'm rollin' up the weed, so we can smoke the next plenty
Hey, so talk records homie
We do it bigger than you ever could imagine
I'm something like Big Pun and Biggie Smalls
Combined, but on half paid
I let these niggas know I dry heave
When I spit the heat, motherfuckers better bundle up, air tight
I be in the club all day through the midnight
You could get it spit right, yeah
I'm tryna let these motherfoes somethin wrong in here
There's somethin' wrong up in my brain
I'm not the same as everyone else
Niggas know the flow is the best in the elf
And stealth, Metal Gear Solid
Move when I'm runnin' in the game, can't stop him
Asthma, nigga Asher Roth and Hamilton
We put the game over and we gon' win
They losin' the game if we choosin'
We off and playin' beer pong all day we boozin'
We choosin' the nice hoes, we tryna get it poppin' after every show
Asher:
I want to admit that I have a track for you
It's called ""She Don't Want A Man""
I think you would... rap to
But I don't mean rap to, I need you on the hook
Shit, I hate to go outside the book, but look
I stole someone's Poland Springs, didn't mean to
I think it was yours and all, but shit, I'm just drinkin' to
Try to stay hyrdrated, you know all day
Hydroplane when I make my way to NY-hey-C
See me on MTV soon, but please, no drama to you
When I was in the Woodies, with the cool kids
We was chillin, I was in the same fuckin' Sperry's as these
Please, can't see me gettin' fuckin' cheese
But hey, in my pockets, these the same dirty jeans
I work for three weeks, same fuckin' jeans, same K-mart tee
I mean this is a K-mart sweatshirt that I haven't washed in two weeks, but fuck it, I'm fuckin' dirty as shit
But now it's off the top talkin' bout nonsense
I don't care cause it's all ral- relevant, hell of it
(Cudi starts hook)
Hell of this, fear this MC shit
So Cudi gonna give me a hook right here
There, for your ears
(Cudi restarts hook)
Crystal clear, it's enough, this is enough
So what, I don't give a fuck, where's my man Snuff at?
Snuffaluffagus, from Sesame Street, deep, you can't see me
I'm like The Beets and Doug Funnie
""The Killer Tofu"" is oh who?
Who? Asher Roth, motherfucker, and now you knew

Hear them callin', me
And I ain't playin' no more
Say, oh I hear 'em callin', me
And I ain't playin' no more, hey
Now I will show you what's in store
Nigga further more, I'm that young boy out in the game, hey
And I can hear 'em callin'
And I can hear 'em callin'
Asher: There you go. You got -- You just got a whole song!

Cudi: That hook was off the dome
Asher: Yeah, we love you enough

Asher: That was love right there
Cudi: That hook was off the dome

Playin' double dutch on Kingsmen with Ben and them
Man this craze, remember the days, when it wasn't 'bout bills
Or finer tip drills or china chrome wheels, plus chrome on the grill
The smile of the moon is savin' me from my doom
And starin' four walls down in a small room

Everyone thinks they're soooo great. Talkin top 5 and be having 30 people write songs for them. Let me tell you something. The days of the fuckery are over. The fake ones wont be lasting too much longer.
Im the one they worry about cause they know I dont give a fuck about the corny shit they do. All my youngins out here reppin, Asap Rocky and the whole ASAP family, Travis Scott, SuperDuper Kyle, Audio Push, Hit Boy, etc, I see yall. And all u jealous chicken hearted shits I see you too.
I am the culture.
I keep silent because I dont ever wanna come off like some angry hater, but today, not only do I feel fantastic, Im feelin like taking over. I already have.
My tweets apply to who they apply. Ye, Drake, whoever. These niggas dont give a fuck about me. And they aint fuckin with me. Niggas keep you close when they see how powerful you are by yourself. When they see your greatness. Out of fear
Ive been loyal to those who haven't been to me and that ends now. Now im your threat.
Anybody got a issue with my words im glad. If you feel me, dont be scared to use your voice. I was for so long out of blind loyalty.
From here Ill let the music speak. As you were, peace and love to my supporters and true ones.  🤘🏾🌹❤️

Wanna make it dude, rap about selling D
Nope, I don't fuck with the dope
But I could if I wanted to, all the tips I get off the radio
And I ain't knocking the hustlers, never that
But when I don't rap that, they say my music is whack?
Damn, we got some fuck priorities
Hip Hop revolution should be top of the priority
I'm the minority, in my own minority

Well I got some advice, be a gentleman first
Then next you should get it to some gangster shit
Make sure it's all real, no waste of shit
Be versatile, flip on some other shit
The only way hip-hop will progress
Is if we all put our all into a track 
Underneath the sternum to the lungs to the heart
This what everybody shoulda been doing from the start
Wish I from it, gave what the industry wanted

I’ll show them one day that this my sacrifice
I’ve got the skills to sing crackles crackling 5
I stand here still waiting for rain
Damn I know this life is so painful yet
Hateful but Graceful
I don’t care adjectives, meanings are fateful
My girl faithful before we broke up
She says we were not right her eyes soaked up
She left me there with my heart broken
No matter if she’s taken I’ve got the tokens

Rainy Days,UnKnown,2011.0,"I hate when it rains, all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinking about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rainy days are a pain, felt the rush through my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebody's looking through my window pane
Mane, I swear I'm gon' catch em'
But maybe I'm trippin' like Scarface
My mind's playing tricks on me homie
When it rains, shit, I just wanna know where Do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements?
Mommy let him come home
I think a nigga done doing wrong
I get scared of the day when his soul will be gone
It's spoken words to thoughts. never been spittin' in vain
It seems the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading to change, ask God if he feels my pain
That please won't you stop the rain

Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain

Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul on this earth was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
My uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play
I just wished I would die
Things rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs
To stop the rain

Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain

Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life while every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
Their mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantle
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just something you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause Im'a just deal with the rain

Im'a deal with the rain
Tell God just to leave it the same
Im'a deal with the rain (x4)
{Outro}
Rainy days
Okay, why's that?
Yeah in Cleveland, it rains

It seems like it rains every day

For one kid it rained too much",https://genius.com/Kid-cudi-rainy-days-lyrics
