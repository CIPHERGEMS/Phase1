Fuck Boy,UnKnown,2015.0,"Six in the morning, nigga at my door
I'm tryna figure out what he out there for
Last time I seen him he was talking shit
Found out his new girl  can't suck no dick
Hit the intercom I ain't let him in
Pussy nigga lucky I ain't fuck his friends
Prolly thought at bitch, Would be down and out
Till he seen my riding round in that chromed out Benz
South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all the ice
You don't want no problems with them boys from the bottom
Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pike
You's a fuck boy, fuck boy
My bitch been said it
That's why I should've let your best friend get it
We went on trips you bought Chanel
But money ain't shit when you soft as hell
Cause you's a fuck boy, fuck boy
My momma even said it
Got a new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it
You still gon talk and that's a got damn shame
But a hoe gon be a hoe and a lame gon be a lame FUCK BOY
You never heard me asking niggas for shit
You be on the gram asking niggas for pics
Can't believe I let you waste all my time
Now this fuck boy on my voicemail crying
Running round town with your bum ass hoe
But I'm the blueprint that's why you at my door
She my number one fan that's what makes it sweet
Bitch'll do anything for a fucking retweet
South Beach nigga you ain't bout that life
You cross that bridge they taking all that ice
You don't want no problems with the boys from the bottom
Strip your ass butt naked and hit the turn pike
You's a fuck boy, fuck boy
My bitch been said it
That's why I shoulda let your best friend get it
We went on trips you bought Chanel
But money ain't shit when you soft as hell
Cause you's a fuck boy, fuck boy

Got a new nigga I ain't even gotta sweat it
You still gon talk and that's a got damn shame
But a hoe gon be a hoe and a lame gon be a lame FUCK BOY

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's bad?
(Wait, hold up)
Who's bad?

I'm representin' for the bitches
All eyes on your riches
No time for the little dicks
You see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends
I'm going after the big man
My g-string make his dick stand
Make it quick, then slow head by the night stand
Like lightning, I wanna nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines
Blank note to take everything
See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho
Young jazzy ho and don't be scared
If you're curious just ask me hoes
And yes dick sucking comes quite natural
Cause I'm da baddest bitch, what

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

See I hate hoes who take their niggas on talk shows and fought hoes
(Y'all sold, fool)
See if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross
And if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho
See I'm unemployed with no boss ho
While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho
See it pays to be the boss ho
Shit that's how you floss hoes
X-rated elevated, buck naked
And I'd probably fuck your daddy
If your mammie wasn't playa hatin'
Cause I'm da baddest bitch
I'm da baddest bitch, what

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
(Shit, I'm the baddest bitch)
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

I got game for young hoes
Don't grow to be a dumb ho, that's a no-no
See if you off the chains
Stay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo
Sell the pussy by the grands
And in months you own a Benz
Another week a set of rims
See if I had the chance to be a virgin again
I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten
See off glass is my motto
Dick suckin' in the auto
Quick fuckin' 'bout to follow
On the back of the truck
Or when I'm dead ass drunk
But I don't get high though
I never took it up the ass
Often tried but I pass
And from what I heard it ain't bad
I'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off
From the baby's dad
Cause I'm da baddest bitch

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

Hope you got a mile for a dick I wanna run

Put this pussy in your jaws now, smack

Hand full of ass and a fist full of weave
Ass in the air, face down on your knees

This is for French Montana, Tory Lanez and friends
J. Harden, and you, too, Mr. Martin
I curved y'all boys (No disrespect to y’all boys)
Yeah, I curved y'all boys (No disrespect to y'all boys)
And to my niggas with bitches that like causin' drama
Me and my bad bitches, we like ""Fuck his baby mama""
He cop me them Chanel bags, them diamonds VVS

This is for the ones who happily always toppin' me sloppily
If your money Monopoly, I ain't fuckin’ you properly (No)
He been tryin’ the liquor, taste like a strawberry daiquiri
The interior chicken and the exterior broccoli
When I come through in that Range Rov', the Barbie chain glow
Keep a baddie with me and we curve ’em like a rainbow
Rockin' ice grills like some serious bitches (Let's go)
It's the Barbie and the baddest, Sagittarius bitches

Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don’t give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat bitch
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick

I know a dude named Wayne that I used to fuck
I slid on him, got a check, then I was off in that truck
Ferrari photo, hit the gas, left foot on the clutch
Countin' money bags, shit, I been bossin' up

I know this ball player that I been wantin' to fuck
I deal with rich niggas and all of them give it up (Uh-huh)
Project bitches, ass fatter than the rest of them (Yeah)

I got a ass eatin' pro (Oh), he's suckin' my toes (Yeah)
Got a bitch bussin' off like calico (Haha)
I got a beggin'-ass dude, want me to ride his face
Got a young side-nigga, gotta hide my face (Rrr)

I got a young rich nigga with a trap in Alpharetta
I got a couple Haitian niggas who be swipin' them cards
Gettin' that income tax money, takin' trips with Minaj
I know some West Coast niggas wanna bang me out
I show you what a project chick is about, show us the money

Give me a project bitch
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a fuck
And say she took that dick
Give me a project chick

Fuck Love,UnKnown,2014.0,"Fuck love, what's that?
You fuckin' round, then coming back
No time for games, I've got a plane to catch
I don't want the ring if it ain't meant
I'm tryna make this love thing work
Next minute I'd be thinking you've got a curve
This nigga got nerve, tryna play me for a bird
I don't want this shit, you can keep that purse
You can keep that whip, you can have that bitch
You'll never find another 10-caramel skin with the right tan
I don't fuck with the hype man
So stop hyping shit like it's still the first night, damn
Being being that you hit it, 'bout 100 times
From the room to the kitchen like one more round
When I used to the dishes you was all up in it
Now you wanna act different

You're tryna give a nigga tough love
But shawty know I give enough love
So mama if you keep this up love
Then you gon' have me saying ""fuck love, fuck love""
Fuck love, fuck love, fuck love
Girl you have me saying ""fuck love""
Fuck love, fuck love
Girl you have me saying

Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
All these rich niggas know me
I was in the benz, so drop drop
A hundred bands on a trophy
Talking 'bout who you want I'm in the new Leron
And this king size is where you belong
And we argued until you was wrong
And I fucked around and tried to lose it all
But I-I showed up right back here
Late night for the night cap here
Take flight for the night back here
Fuck around and get it right back here
No one calling up, no one calling up
Cause you gon' follow us
Cause when you fuck with me
You know what's all enough

You're tryna give a nigga tough love
But shawty know I give enough love
So mama if you keep this up love
Then you gon' have me saying ""fuck love, fuck love""
Fuck love, fuck love, fuck love
Girl you have me saying ""fuck love""
Fuck love, fuck love
Girl you have me saying

All that I want is you
Can't let you go, can't waste my time
Please don't you tease it

But that's so hard to find
A big future, she just want to

 one
But all she gets is wasted time
Cause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas
Cause she keep falling' for them flaw ass niggas
All she ever wanted was a REAL ONE
But that's so hard to find

I keep yelling 'Fuck boy this' and 'Fuck boy that'
Should've never let the fuckboy tap
Gotta blame myself
I should've been gone
You's a new ass nigga
I been on, I been on, I been on
Should've never let you out the friends zone
Niggas like you make me so sick
I guess you got the lame nigga syndrome
Back to the money doe
I'm still talking big money ho!
I ain't about that flex, I'm about that check
That's for any nigga who wanna know
I throw the deuce up and cop Medusas
I pull the trucks out, I put the coupes up
I don't take no losses, I'm no loser
Big business, is what I'm used to

All she ever wanted was a real one

I shop myself, I cop myself
For myself, by myself
Got my health, got my wealth
Got my own, don't need no help
Know how to play with the cards I'm dealt
But it would be nice to have a REAL ONE
Picket fences and a lil one
Fly nigga with a bankroll
Educated, but still to know how to kill some
Is that too much to ask?
Do I want too much, too fast?
Do I drive these niggas mad
Soon as they touch the ass?
Can't teach these boys to be men though
Should've learned that from they kinfolk
And I should've known what I was in for
Soon as I gave the fuck nigga my info

All she ever wanted was a real one
But that's so hard to find
A big future, she just want to built one
But all she gets is wasted time
Cause she keep falling' for them flow ass niggas

Even though she's so fine

Oh, I hope that situation don't drive you out your mind
And I won't talk about no nigga
I'll only tell you what it would be like if I was, if I was your nigga
Let's let the old shit remain the old shit
Leave it in the past, and we'll remain focus
Say you got an ex, but I ain't even noticed
I ain't trippin' 'bout that nigga or my old bitch
I just know what I be on, got a California King to put your body on
Make a nigga mad when we put on that ass
But the Og got the shady form
All she ever wanted was a real one
But that's so hard to find
A big future, she just want to built one

Temporary love is what we pretended we needed
Or were we really pretending, cuz now I can't believe it
Look at how I fill this card up, we yelling that we leaving
Knowing it'd would never last, it's only for a season
That you go back to her, and I'll go back to him

I don't know why I'm there, and you don't know either
Maybe just cuz it's convenient just to say that he's my nigga

Late at night I'm not in the mood, I'm acting funny
Every conversation I'm talking rude, I'm acting funny
When he be touching on me, I swear it's not the same
I remember one time I called him your name
I played it off though, but who's to really blame?
We're playing a deck of cards, it's a dirty game
The sad part about it is he a good nigga
The temptation got me turnt up forreal nigga
I'm cheating, and I'm caught up in the mix
Tell me when you're with ya girl, do you think of this?

I know that I'm wrong
But this temptation is taking over me
I mean the way that it makes you feel
I feel defeat

I told her go ahead and try it just for the laughter
Now whe're feelin bad for all tha hoes you're goin after
Looks can be deceivin, and you're poppin much game
Crib in your moms name, claim of fortune and fame
Dressed in ICEBERG, senese still attached
Rockin a gator, fake rolly, hollow links to match
I sit back and watch, as you dig yourself deeper
Digits all in your beeper, you want her, better keep her
Last night you was all up in the club, slingin grips
Slippin DJ Roslay, givin dick tips away
Basically, you was holdin like you just went pro
But little did they know, you was flossin my doe
No, I got to go, before you cause a bitch to flick
From waistline to the bottom, you know niggas ain't shit

Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks
Lick the pearl tongue, nigga, keep your dick
Get the fuck out after I cum
So I can hop in my Coup and make a quick run
Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks
Lick the pearl tongue, nigga, keep your dick
Get the fuck out after I cum
So I can hop in my Coup and make a quick run

You ain't shit to me yo
I'm spendin grands down in Rio
Manaje` in trio, garage like it cee-lo
4-5-6, Range Rov, 4.6 I lay low
While ya'll hoes slob dick, you back in ballin ass
Niggas ain't shit, taste the clit
And y'all pussy lickin and shit
Wanna go low on me like a basement?
That's why I don't see none of y'all
You better recognize gang(game?) bitch, while I sit in front of y'all
I don't owe you shit, nigga you owe me
I'm bout to change the locks, nigga keep the gold key
You better get your shit, take it to your mamy house
I'm bout to show you what a bitch from Miami bout
You got me fucked up, nigga ain't no free nut
Unless you comin VVS marquis cut

Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks
Lick the pearl tongue, nigga, keep your dick
Get the fuck out after I cum
So I can hop in my Coup and make a quick run
Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks
Lick the pearl tongue, nigga, keep your dick
Get the fuck out after I cum
So I can hop in my Coup and make a quick run
Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks
Lick the pearl tongue, nigga, keep your dick
Get the fuck out after I cum
So I can hop in my Coup and make a quick run
Niggas ain't shit, but hoes and tricks
Lick the pearl tongue, nigga, keep your dick

Verse: Whats your description? I told you mine I wuz feeling real horny called the party lines

The way that he was talking and describing his self I pictured Reggie Bush I ain't seeing
Nothing else
My eyes closed tight on the living room couch one hand on pussy putting fingers in my
Mouth
Cheating on my man I'm getting my freak on as long as it ain't real I ain't doing nothing

It back, thristing my hips, throwing champaigne down and he taking sweet sips now we
Bout to climax he just took me on a trip
Chorus:
Verse: The next day I called the party line again I was looking for that voice that's when I
Thug in a thug that sounded like trick to me you should have heard that nasty fantasy

Walk out he said bend over show him a shot in my private school skirt so aroused to god
Hard as a missile I blew on his whistle role playing back and forth he said I can't dismiss
You asked me if I could kiss you then I got wet
This phone home thing is getting better than sex don't need protection everythings safe

Wait bitch, I'mma blow my kisses
Get pissed and throw my dishes
Y'all niggas know just who this is

 And the head so vicious
With me, this shit gon' cost, you short, then that's your loss
You know this ass is soft, make a nigga go to breaking off
Tell me that you love me baby and get high and fuck me crazy
Get a towel and wipe me off
You want a bitch with no type of flaws
My girls be shopping hard, these hoes be buying cars
In the club buying bars, nipples hard in designer bras
All my niggas who getting cheese, throwback and the crispy Gs
Moet, Cris on freeze, laugh at a tab cuz this on me
Me and Luda in a Cut Supreme
Doing things just to touch the cream
So many names wanna fuck the Queen
I live a life like it's just a dream, UH!

YO! I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)

Gonna make you (UGH!) next to the subwoofers in my 6 by 9
Tell me that you like it raw, tell me that my dick is MWAH!
I might make you famous
And buy you watches by Maurice Lacroix
Tell me if it's new or old, tell me if it's hot or cold
Let me know if it's black and bold, say, ""Ludacris, 6 million sold""
See I ain't got no time for games, and I ain't got no time for lames
How you loving my Southern slang?
Ooh, eee, walla-walla-bing-bang
So anytime you need me call, winter summer spring or fall
It doesn't matter, come one come all
Either get dropped or drop them drawers

YO! I want my ass smacked (Legs wide)
Front back (Side to side)
Pussy wet (Slip-N-Slide)

Diamond Princess, just mind your business
These rumors are senseless, your whispers are endless
We living ghetto fab, we spending hella cash
This girl is hella bad, your choice is trailer trash
Too much taste for whores, you saw me grace The Source
You watched me work the Vibe, bitches, I works for mine
One time for these divas, two times for these Visas
Third time I come, I'm breezing, the ice just keeps on freezing
Hold up, I'ma keep it going back to back, I'ma keep on blowing
Platinum plaques, keeping it hood, wet sex, keeping it good
Look, girl, you don't know my angle
A hundred thou on a platinum bangle
My niggas will slow your roll, pussy power, we in control

Don’t Trip,Glamorest Life,2005.0,"Go by the name of Weezy F and
I'm walkin' out the Bally store with ten bags
Fly as a motherfucker girlie on my staple
Cause her friend say I'm a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel
I'm up in little Haiti
 (yeah), 
I'm blowin' on Jamaica
 (yeah)
I'm in a pepper Beamer (yeah), I'm with a saltshaker
 (yeah)
Now I'm in Dade county (yeah), I see some thick bitches (yeah)
I try to holla at 'em but they all trick bitches (damn!)
I think Trina sexy (oh!), mama you wine-fine (yep!)
And on the hush-hush (oh!) we need some quiet time (shh!)
Yeah I'm all right ma , 
the Birdman's boy 
He own Cash Money, I pre-own Cash Money
Yeah, and I put her on Cash Money
She start wobblin' that ass for me (whoa!)
She start modelin'(whoa!)
She see the models in the Maybach (whoa!)
She call me Weezy F baby and she make sure she say that

If you see a fly nigga baby girl yeah I don't trip
Just give him lil' thigh mama give him lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars take her on a few trips
Give him lil' thigh mama give him lil' hip
Then you give him lil' wind-up, give him lil' dip
If you see a fly bitch nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars take her on a few trips

Now I'm the daughter of the Madam inside of a pink Phantom
If your man got that cash then best believe I'm at him
Cause I'm sharp as a machete and I cuss like great (that's right)
Niggas call me Betty Crocker cause my cake stay plenty
Got stacks on top of stacks, I'm cuppin' a mill ticket
No matter the consequence my emphasis is to get it
It's Trina, Weezy F baby, Mannie handle the script
It's so reminiscent to Gladys Knight and the Pips (that's right)
All my niggas jump around girls jump on that dick
It ain't gone be no standin' round now let's get crunk in this bitch
And ladies show him your shit a lil' hip, a lil' thigh
Mo' pleasure for the eye and the mo' a nigga try (that's right)
You can find me stretched out in my eight-fifty yacht
Or my big six hundred believe Trina done it
Believe I'm diamond studded stay flooded like a dam
Chase grands cause I am what I am, don't give a damn, go!

If you see a fly nigga baby girl yeah I don't trip
Just give him lil' thigh mama give him lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars take her on a few trips
Give him lil' thigh mama give him lil' hip
Then you give him lil' wind-up, give him lil' dip
If you see a fly bitch nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars take her on a few trips

Back to the lesson at hand stick to my plan
When it comes to seeing man after man, don't give a damn
Bout his cars or his grands, what, what, what, what, what
Cause I'mma make my own ends and that's what what's up
Ladies, let say you want a man (yeah) but don't know how to do it (yeah)
Dirty dance with him put a lil' back into it (yeah)
Go catch a wall shawty, end up at the malls thought he
Tried to dog waldy make him spend it all on ya (damn!)
Yep! And make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin' for that kitty kat (oh!)
Winin' and dinin' for that ass give him none of that
Just let him know, say
""Make a bitch rich"" cause the baddest bitch taught you that

If you see a fly nigga baby girl yeah I don't trip
Just give him lil' thigh mama give him lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars take her on a few trips
Give him lil' thigh mama give him lil' hip

Climbing all on top of me
If he ain't gonna fuck me properly
It's got to be, possibly
A dick that ain't too soft for me
Nigga get your ass up off of me
Besides your dick to small for me
I gots to be fucked right, sucked right
In the butt right like a slut like
In the bright lights, every day all night
Now talk to me, why you fuck me violently?
Calling me names that apply to me
Cumming all inside of me
Don't lie to me, now tell the truth
Is this pussy good to you?
Grip for you, good and tight
But full of juice
Why wouldn't you?
Why shouldn't you?
Scream while I am riding you
Over you making this pussy stroke for you
Like your bitch supposed to do
Close to you and I'm feeling most of you
Deep for me, we can meet
Fuck me till I fall asleep
Not unless there three nuts for me
Or get your ass up off of me
Ol' tired ass nigga besides
You ain't even all that any way
FUCK YOU!

Bitched you done showed out
And I got no beef
If this was my house bitch
You would've been thrown out
And y'all bitches better hold up
Simmer down and get the fours up
Mouth all tored up
All this is swolled up
Y'all bitches better show some love
Or your licking these nuts saying that freaky stuff
And you ain't gotta have the best head
But bitch it better be close enough
See I don't need ya, I don't see ya
And I really won't wanna be ya
If head is nappy and you boppin' me
Young bitch then that's illegal
You always braggin' and beggin'
Talkin' 'bout what the last nigga gave ya
See everybody ain't able
But y'all bitches so ungrateful
You need to ask questions about dushy
Cause I hate the smell of stank pussy
And you're under arms a little musky
I was gonna spare ya but you had to push me

Bitch I don't need you
No way, no how, not then, not now

You see the problem is I used to like Khia til you started
Jumpin' on the dick with Trick and doin' all of my leftover shit
Now yous a scam, What's up? You get the leftover hits
Bitch get on the bandwagon or get left over bitch
Can't believe the Baddest Bitch whipped this drunk ass bitch
Her slay titties havin', fake Lauryn Hill ass bitch
Move to Georgia cause in Florida, you wasn't hittin' on shit
Now you's a mess ho, that's why they cut you out yo' own video
You dissin' for promo and dissing me is a no-no
I'm the queen of rings riches and dough ho
But back to the promo, yo I'mma still try and help you out
Ay y'all I'm talking bout Khia, dirty bitch of the south

Now what's beef?
Beef is when bitches titties lookin' like they sleep
Beef is when her clothes lookin' like dirty sheets
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when these hoes say mah name in the streets
Beef is when they fame only last a few weeks
Beef is when I help you sell the records just like I do, now that's beef

Yo' neck and you' back bitch, you know you was wrong
And ""K Wang"" ho? I ain't even like that song
Oh is all of this just over some dick?
I told you in my debut, Best Friends, I do five or six
Enough of that bitch, I got some other shit to address
About some pussy ass niggas with mah name in they tracks
Sayin' (Trina fucked Baby now she fuckin' Lil' Wayne)
You niggas snitchin on your records, fuckin' up a bitch name
You wouldn't do that to a nigga so why you do it to me?
You sounding like a ho nigga, why you slandering T?
Cause yous a Cash Money reject, a ninth ward soldier
Keep fuckin' with that boy and you gonna end up in a coma
And what about the waterboy, kid the silly
Last I heard you ain't even from Philly
So nigga keep the bitch women and let the players handle this shit
Cause you just dissin' for a deal but I'm dissing with the real, Yup

Now what's beef?
Beef is when the dope make a nigga fall asleep
Beef is when you sound like a muthafuckin' sheep (Ba Ba)
Beef is when I help you sell records just like I do, now that's beef
What's beef?
Beef is when a street nigga beefin' with a chick
Beef is when you brag on another nigga's dick
Beef is when I help you sell records just like I do, now that's beef, nigga

Fuck niggas
You niggas can't be serious
You niggas is real fuckin' funny to me
Fuck outta here",https://genius.com/Trina-whats-beef-lyrics

Welcome to Digglers Wild World of Girls
I'm sitting here with the Baddest Bitch (Thats Right)
So Trina tell us a little something about yourself

Hustla I'm the queen of this south shit
Tight with a cute face that's what I'm bout bitch
Sexy, specialize in fellatio
All about my pesos, never was a fake ho
Shot shore throw
Throw the cock like a flamethrower
In the mouth of a cock blower
Just a diva mack momma looking for them ends
Traded in the Lex for a G-5 Benz
Touring on the road getting stacks
20 grand karats for the show no tax
Bell-V is what I'm pourin on them hatas
Blinding with the lock no imitaders
Broke ass niggas getting on my nerves
Get sliced, diced, chopped, and served
Ask, am I off the chain? I won't lie
But I don't want your man boo fuck that guy, uh

Oh, okay, all right
I see how y'all be getting down in 
the MIA
But Trina what I really wanna know is
How would you get with a nigga who live with a bitch?

Wait... for his bitch to live
Ms. Trina gotta trick up her sleeve
Open up the door I walk straight in the house
Put your man down and put my cock in his mouth
(Damn) I need a heavyweight like Georgy Foreman
To work my ocean like the Long Shoreman
I'm real successful, I live off interests
So get it right bitch I'm the Diamond Princess
Banking and its all for the cause
(Hey Trina would you suck a nigga dick) Bitch hell naw
And fuck what a bitch tell yall
Stay the fuck outta mine ho and go get a job, ugh

Damn girl

But what I really wanna know is
How you set a motherfucker up...?

See a nigga pumpin gas, don't look

Sell em' with your name and your freak out game
And show a lil' shot of ass just to get in his brain
Tell em what he wanna hear, calm and slow
""You want this ass? Come on let's go""
Call my dawgs at the hotel, let em' know I'm coming
Bring em' upstairs and leave the car running
Get em' in the room don't be scared
Go in broke come out with bread
That's what a nigga get, playing with that cheese
Fun for a freaking, watch ya get skeeze
Out the door, real quick
Then out come my dawgs with the K's and shit
Thinking with your dick man that ain't nothing
(Trina one more thing) Naw no more questions

See now that's what I'm talking 'bout
We need more real motherfucking bitches representing real shit

Lights out. I'm faded bitch. Come for me, don't do it bitch
Say it loud, epitome. I run these streets

Hotter than grease. Sandra Dee

Boss bitch, I ain't never hard to find
I pop out when I feel like it and kill it every time
Shit, I'm doin' fine and you bitches should get in line
I'm the one they really watchin', you bitches is out of time
Saw a bitch that owe me money, and I put that on my moms
Put a clip to that bitch head 'cause she was out of mind
Nothin' but big bills, look around me, I'm paid
305, muhfucka, from the county of Dade

This a bad bitch anthem, get your fuckin' hands up
Get your hands up, get your fuckin' hands up

B-b-b-b-bad bitch, a couple grand in the duffel
Good pussy costs, bitch, you hoes ain't got no hustle
I raise the bar, and you bitches ain't got no muscle
I let you hoes rock, but now you hoes are trouble
I mean, your nigga sexy, he be blowin' up my messages

I am the Diamond Princess so I'm lovin' every second
Baptize him in my pussy, he said I'm such a blessin'
I'm the shit and I'm that bitch without a muthafuckin' doubt
Tryin' to come up off my name, you gets no muthafuckin' clout
I could even make it rain or cause a muthafuckin' drought
Cut the check and show respect and keep my name from out ya mouth, bitch

Get your hands up, get your fuckin' hands up

It's a honor, take him to meet my momma

He undress me with his eyes when I'm getting dressed

You lyin' to my face, but how you love me on the daily?
Shit, I took pride in you, nigga
Shotgun, only one to ride for you, nigga
I cook, clean, even provide for you, nigga
Took my dreams and I put 'em to the side for you, nigga
What I get?  Nuttin' at all
Instead of pickin' it up, you was duckin' my call
Instead of callin' the shots, you was hittin' the bar
Clown nigga do anything to fuck with a star
Shit, how I fall for your slick ass
Insecure, chauvinistic, evil lil' dick ass
Yeah, do anything just to get back
The time, money and effort I spent on your bitch ass
Yeah, and who these bitches you be fuckin' with?
Never catch me with a new crew on some other shit
Call me out my name, you mistake me for another bitch
Your mother, bitch, I'll pop a nigga on some sucka shit
Yeah, you made your bed, sleep peacefully
No hard feelings, when you see me just don't speak to me
Yeah, could give a fuck about you missin' me
You stupid muthafucka shoulda had the common decency!

(Huh) When we met, I admit you had more (had more)
Two cars and the crib double floors (All right)
Don't be actin' like I ain't had you spoiled
'Cause, bitch, you ain't meet me poor!
In the mall every day, you was tearin' up the stores
Now my dick little and I'm insecure?
Why?  Bitch, you foul
If it wasn't for probation, probably slap you down
But you know that ain't me, my style
Even though this our house, but I get out, huh?
I was the nigga that you vented to
When them hoes you run with shitted on you, oh forgot that?
Talkin' down on a nigga to the same bum bitch who tried to give me some pussy, oh you forgot that?
Well, you gon' learn about listenin' to bitches who couldn't keep a nigga if a nigga wanted to be kept
But you gon' feel it in the end when you in the house and look around and realize you livin' by yaself!
You will never find another like I
G-code, gettin' money or fly
This whole shit was a waste of time
But yo' loss, baby, it ain't mine

Money ain’t a problem,UnKnown,2014.0,"I'm the queen till the death of me
Can't compare me, I'm higher than that epitome
I'm the queen till the death of me
I'm higher than that epitome
I'm the queen till the death of me
I put you hoes up under extortion

I switch 24 outfits in one fucking day
24 cars in 24 different driveways
My money long, mandingo
I'm talking guap, jackpot, the casino
Brazilian long weave with some bow legs
Work in the trunk for my nigga I'mma thorough bread
I'm wiping pots, baking cookies for the block
Now I'm off to meeting my secret service, I'm Barrack

I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I ain't got no money problems

Everything top of the line and my shoes match my purse
How come, they think it's a funeral, they think the Ghost is a hearse
I been burried you bitches, bitch, I'm six albums in
You gotta go through the queen before the game let you in
See, I'm gonna eat regardless, I've been sold, my harvest
And I don't beg no pardon, and from what I heard they starving
Money all in my bag, ATM swag
Just left the island, got jet lag, in a G5 to the G wagon and
I'm pulling up to Bell Harbor
Shopping till my feet hurt, watch me pop my collar
Security and my chauffer, red bottoms my loafers
The bank account full, I got workers
The bank account full, so much money in it
I could write a million checks and bet the check won't fucking dent it
Got so many M's you would swear a bitch was humming (hmmmmmmm)
Cause I live by 'you ain't talking money, you ain't talking nothing'

I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen
Money ain't a problem
Money ain't a problem
I'm sliding soft, my whip clean
I'm still the baddest bitch that you ever seen

Money ain't a problem
I ain't got no money problems

Money ain't a problem so I don't ever hate
I'm busy skipping lines while you bum bitches wait
2,000 plates
, panoramic fucking views
You know it's Cinderella, you can tell by my shoes
That money ain't a problem so I don't ever hate
I'm busy skipping lines while you bum bitches wait
2,000 place, panoramic fucking views
I'm shitting on you bitches, bird flu
Million stunner, track race runner
Field goal punter, wild jungle hunter
I got diamonds in the backseat, chauffer, no taxi
Got the coupe painted yellow gold so you bitches know that's me
That's me, the bitch that you love to hate
If it's a heice, I'm the bitch that got away
If in the fight, you the bitch got put away
And I'm the bitch getting money each and every day

And I'm in love with a baller now
Treat him right cause that's all I got
The good dick had me falling out
And I love the freaky things he be saying
And the names he be calling out
Yeah and he knows how to treat me
Eats me when he freaks me
The real one and his cum tastes so sweet
Rough sex to a slow beat
As he holds me and pokes me
And the beat won't stop, the bass don't drop
Till I climb on top of his cock and close shop
Make his toes lock
While y'all hoes jock
See you got me callin'

How to maintain, respect the game
Save my change and even showed me some crazy things
And we exchanged our favorite things
I got inside his fantasies
Cause them things was the middle of me
Climaxin' on the canopy
Well this freak put his hand inside of me
Unsolved mystery
Thinkin' 'bout gets me all wet
And I'm pissed he ain't called yet
I guess good sex is what you call it
And I'll know he'll call back
So I'mma just go cook for the man
Shake up crooks and do the books for the man
Makin' the cheese you done took from the man
If the sex is good I'mma hook the man
Even if he's a veteran
If I go on my way without you
Oh how can I go?
If I go on my way without you
Oh where will I go?

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's bad?
Wait hold up, who's bad?
I'm representin' for the bitches all eyes on your riches
No time for the little dicks you see the bigger the dick
The bigger the bank, the bigger the Benz
The better the chance to get close to his rich friends
I'm going after the big man, G-string make his dick stand
Make it quick then slow head by the night stand
Like lightning I wanna nigga with a wedding ring
Bank accounts in the Philippines blank note to take everything
See I fuck him in the living room
While his children ain't home
I make him eat it while my period on
A little nasty ho, red-bone but a classy ho
Young jazzy ho and don't be scared
If you're curious just ask me hoes
And yes dick sucking comes quite natural
I'm da baddest bitch what
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Shit I'm the baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
See I hate hoes who take their niggas
On talk shows and for hoes, y'all sold fool
See if I'm ever crossed or ever caught up in the cross
And if it's your fault ho, I'm going off ho
See I'm unemployed with no boss ho
While y'all sucking dick for free I'm broke off ho
See it pays to be the boss ho
Shit that's how you floss hoes X-rated elevated, buck naked
And I'd probably fuck your daddy
If your mammie wasn't playa hatin'
'Cause I'm da baddest bitch, I'm da baddest bitch what
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?
I got game for young hoes
Don't grow to be a dumb hoe, that's a no no
See if you off the chains
Stay ahead of the game, save up buy a condo
Sell the pussy by the grands and in months you own a Benz
Another week a set of rims
See if I had the chance to be a virgin again
I'd be fucking by the time I'm ten
See off glass is my motto, dick suckin' in the auto
Quick fuckin' 'bout to follow
On the back of the truck
Or when I'm dead ass drunk but I don't get high though
I never took it up the ass often tried but I pass
And from what I heard it ain't bad
I'm a curious bitch who took off to get broke off
From the baby's dad 'cause I'm da baddest bitch
Who's bad? Who's, who's bad?

No More,Diamonds Are Forever [Mixtape],2011,"What the use of the back rub, and everything that I do that you ask for
If I could make you feel better I don’t pass up
And now you gotta get gone
I done spent a lot of nights trying to make it all right
Up on cloud 9 i was on those flights
You should've told me that you had a little fear of heights
Before I were to think that you and me could have a life
Created me a monster, yes i admit
Stayed with you wen i found out about the chick
I should have left then but I’m gonna leave now
You ain’t stepping up so I gotta step down
You gotta understand my position
Keep talkin so you can’t listen
You done up'd and made it all different
When you was close it still felt distant
So I’m gonna step down, it’s only right baby
I gotta step down, cause I’m the kind of lady
And I ain’t in the business trying to keep no dude
That ain’t trying to be kept
No, no, beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
Now we ain’t working no more
Beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more
I’m so tired, so damn tired
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more
We was making love like all day
Then I guess it all just changed
How you say that you ain't know a thang
After all the times I complained
You said you was thinking bout a ring
And I was dumb enough to believe
Putting all this stress on me, look all this I don’t need
So I guess I have to proceed
Instead of us I’ma do me
It’s time for me to break free
You and me together just can’t be
So I’m gonna step down, it’s only right baby
I gotta step down, cause I’m the kind of lady
And I ain’t in the business creating no wish list
They ain’t even realistic
Beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse, out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more
I’m so tired, so damn tired
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more
This love seems quite unfamiliar
Words mean nothing if I can’t feel 'em
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Yeah, boy you crazy, you got this twisted
This good loving that you gon miss it
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
Beating the hell out of a dead horse
It ain’t working no more, more",https://genius.com/Trina-no-more-lyrics

9-27-82 born
Look into my eyes
I'm so torn
Slow down baby and get a clear view
Cause when you roll down your windows
I'm in your rear view
Hold on baby boy
I know its hard for ya
But ya girl got your back
And I'mma ride for ya
And I swear for god, I'd die for ya
How'd I look in your eyes and still lie to ya?
Now when you look in my eyes, I just cry to ya
Chris brown made it hard to say goodbye to ya
I still remember those days I got a dial tone
Tears falling from my eyes
But I held on
Now your memories are all I've got to live on
All outta my zone
I can't move on
Hurts worse than death
That you so gone
But the chapter is done
Poof, be gone
I wipe away my tears
I got my swag back
Word out on the streets is that ya girl is back
You must not know bout me
I got your name tattooed so the world could see
I dreamt one day we'd make we
A boy for you and a girl for me
But one day just outta the blue
That boy for you became a dream come true
(so many memories)

Now
I'm stressing
No resting
You chilling
Its killing
We... gone
Yea and now I'm back in my zone
I got so many saying I should leave it alone
Give it up let it go cause your boy is gone
Stop driving by his crib cause your boy ain't home
Stop looking at your pager and stop calling his phone
You better act like you fly and put your lip gloss on
Put your ass in ya jeans and get your grown girl on
You should've listened to your mama and picked up that phone
One call ain't hurt
I shed blood for you
And when them niggahs started hating I threw slugs for you
Now all that's left is what was of you
And now I wanna wake up cause there's no you
And now I'm down on my knees asking ""what'd I do?""
Cause baby life means nothing to me without you
Real love never dies that's what you told me
But now your love's flowing all through the industry
And now the media and press got a hold of we
And now the whole world knows that we ain't we
And she ain't we
And she ain't me
And she can never be
Listen up to em
Cause I'm talking to you
I got a message and its just for you
(so many memories)

Red carpet next to me is a good look for ya
Paparazzi snapping pictures for ya
You know I love the way you talk when you real high
You ? your bags when you come home and that's fly
Baby boy you kept it real and kept me looking nice
Made it rain in my purse each and every night
Back seat of the phantom made it look twice
And now its all just a memory of my life
One ring one watch one chain
One you one me one name
Just let me drown
Please don't save me
You know you should have held down a little harder baby
But now ya girl's on her own
No more carter baby
I said ya girl's on her own
No more carter baby
No kissing
No touching
No hugging
No snuggling
I'm missing your loving
My body can't function
Now I'm back on my grind
I gotta stay fly
Ya girl's hot
In the ? I'm so high
Haters all on my back but they can all die
Stunting just like you daddy no lie

Big whipper

I miss ya",https://genius.com/Trina-so-many-memories-lyrics

Wanna be on TV, man, what's wrong with him?
I be watchin' they moves and I be tellin' my bitches
Man, he be thinkin' I'm clueless, so I'm out for his riches

Didn't get far, these niggas thinkin' they slick
Then they come back crawlin' and shit
Niggas lost everythin', now they on they dick

Nigga, I don't wanna talk
I erased all your math, social media blocked
And it ain't my fault
You got caught in the web, what the fuck you thought?
Ain't no bitch that better than me
I'm young Moses, I could part any sea
So think twice when you checkin' for me

No bra, titties out, bitch, I think I'm Rick Ross
Think I'm Big Meech, make chop like Bruce Lee
And the last thing you should think, a bitch sleep
My game on fleek
And your new bitch, she homeless chic
I laugh at it 'cause she's a small matter
I live a high rise, her section 8 chatter
And you ain't no better
Thinkin' these hoes gon' make you better, what a fuck nigga?
Lil nigga, go and play with these hoes
'Cause you ain't in my league, nigga, I ball with pros

Nigga, I don't wanna talk
I erased all your math, social media blocked
And it ain't my fault
You got caught in the web, what the fuck you thought?
Ain't no bitch that better than me
I'm young Moses, I could part any sea
So think twice when you checkin' for me
'Cause it ain't no comin' back, I'm a real OG

You wanted to leave, baby
But see I don't need you, baby
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
You wanted to leave, baby
But see I don't need you, baby
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me
Don't you come runnin' back to me
Runnin' back to me",https://genius.com/Trina-back-to-me-lyrics

Don't lie to me I'm a hot commodity
Six figures from the nigga cause he got to be
Don't lie to me; I'm what you try to be

I'm a big girl not a little girl
I had a real man
Moving real girl
We was real close
He had real money
All he ever asked ""never steal from me""
That was real shit
I'm a real bitch
He told me stay real and I'm a make you real rich
Back to reality
Is this real?
Big house on the hill far from Lincoln Field. (ohh)
I'm so hood, yet I wouldn't stay
Couldn't name a price that the nigga wouldn't pay
Snap my fingers he'll be over here today
If I asks, he'll rub my feet for days

I ain't even empty handed I beg your pardon
If I'm departing I'm taking everything cause I'll be damned
If another bitch wore your last name
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all
Put your hands up ladies if you want it all
Say I want it all

I went looking for your phone when I shouldn't have cause
I found just what I was looking for
A new number says its Kelly should I call it or should I just ignore
Now I'm sittin' here wondering when you're coming home
Then I thought about it everything that's going on
I gotta leave this relationship but I'm not leaving here
So let me get my list out
What do I want other than this house
First off let me put your ish out call me crazy if
You wanna but I don't care
Now back to my list
Gotta have the house check
Do I want the car check
Do I want the money check
Gotta have it all check
And I deserve it hope it was worth it
And I don't think that I'll be needing your service
I need his house (I need his house)
I need his car (I need his car)
Empty the bank (empty the bank)
I want it all (I want it all)
I gave you all my love and got nothing in return
So now I want it all (I want it all)

If I'm gonna have to hurt u gonna feel it how I feel it
Play the cards how I deal it
You know I was the realist
Cause the way you going bout this like I never meant shit
Now you want the other bitch cause we had an argument
Ok roll the dice Imma show you how it go
And since u wanna do it dirty watch this fire cracker blow
This ain't no tip or tap shit its all about the principle
How you expect to leave me without a comma or decimal
Pay me for my pain
Pay me for my time
Nigga you can say the bullshit cause everything is mine
From the house in West Pond to the yacht in Burlise
U can keep your sad face baby hand me them keys
Cause the shit you said it did it
Threw me way off track
But when a woman is fed up no it ain't no turning back
Only thing gonna make me smile is if I feel my satisfaction
Is seeing you hurt is fuckin' you suffering while I'm relaxing
So now I need his house (I need his house)
I need his cars (I need his cars)
Empty the bank (empty the bank)

No Games,Dynasty 6,2016.0,"I won't play your games no more
I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives or
If you want to leave this longing home
Well, I won't play your games no more

Last time I just broke down, he was playin' round with my freedom
Rude ways he would talk to me, I had to realize I didn't need him
Sex and my best friend when she really wasn't no bestie
A lot of shit was runnin' through my head but I was 'fraid they always gon' catch me
What did I gain? I lost everythin'
Got caught in this whip, I'm embarrassed, ashamed
All I got is my name, all I got is my name
So I crawled out of that dog pit and I shined bright as a diamond
So when the haters wished that I fell off, my fate made me keep climbin'

How was I lovin' and trustin' and fuckin' that nigga that ain't bein' real?
Why was I settlin' and let him play with my feelin's when I kept it real?
I just snapped, I pulled the trigger, 6 shots, third of December
Told that nigga had a bad temper, why he forget I'm a boss bitch
Told that hoe don't cross this, don't put me the middle that bullshit
'Cause I'm a real G's on some boss shit, I'm a real G and I'm a boss bitch
My heart, don't touch my heart
I made it clear from the start
If you break it, it's broke forever
But I guess he wasn't that smart

I won't play your games no more
I won't play your games no more
If you won't believe my motives or
If you want to leave this longing home
Well, I won't play your games no more

Who am I? I'm confused, been lost without direction
All the games and lies been told, I'm the one they question
Red and blue, strobe lights, 10 placed in the whole damn section
Stripped from all my everythin' 'cause now they had the weapon
Your Honor, it was self defence, no house, no picket fence
Now the State has evidence and they chargin' me with the precedence
Love has made a fool, love made me break the rules
Love never ever loved me, love turned out so uncool

How was I lovin' and trustin' and fuckin' that nigga that ain't bein' real?
Why was I settlin' and let him play with my feelin's when I kept it real?
I just snapped, I pulled the trigger, 6 shots, third of December
Told that nigga had a bad temper, why he forget I'm a boss bitch
Told that hoe don't cross this, don't put me the middle that bullshit
'Cause I'm a real G's on some boss shit, I'm a real G and I'm a boss bitch
My heart, don't touch my heart
I made it clear from the start
If you break it, it's broke forever
But I guess he wasn't that smart

Young bitch named Trina from the 3-0-5
Why a bitch from the bottom gotta be so fly?
See them big boys steady on they grind, right?
So tell me how the hell I'm not supposed to be on mine

I learned the game from my 'ole girl

Five-nine light brown, fire head on her
Looking like I'm the hoes choice, I drive a Rolls Royce
Push start, real nigga ride clean, don't it?
No roof in the coupe with the top back
Riding in a foreign and he straight out the projects
I got the game from a old nigga
He said, ""All your whips clean, dawg, you gon' need four killas""

And I don't fuck 'em if that pussy ain't pretty
Might buy me another foreign in the morning
Sit that bitch real low on them Forgis
Might fuck around and name dat bitch Trina
So I can get in it every time I see her
You ever rode with a nigga smell this good?
Ever fucked with a nigga that was this hood?
Put ya on ya stomach, eat that pussy from the back, baby

To love and to cherish
Form this day forward
Until death do you part

Uh!
I guess I wasn't enough for you
The things I done for you
Call me I run to you
Whenever you want me to
What have I done to make you hurt me a time or two
Probably more then a few
My heart still beats for you
Wonder what did I do
Damn I should've knew
But still didn't have a clue
My life would be so blue
Yeah I'm hurt it's true
Not feeling me next to you
Laughing at things you do
Kissing and calling me boo
Now it's hard to eat
Damn I feel so weak
And I can't get no sleep
My eyes continue to leak
Pouring out like the rain
This hurts more then pain
Apologizes with the pain
I went against the brain
Baby please don't go
I need you more n more

Is that I got you
No matter who tells you that

Know that I need you back here

Cooking and cleaning for you
Taking good care of you and
Making sweet love to you
Baby just close your eyes
And picture my hips and thighs
Laying right next to you
I'm getting the best of you
Tell me you need me back
I promise I'm running right back

Why did you run from this

With you I was full of bliss
Baby please don't go
I just can't take no more
I'm screaming and kicking
Cause really I needs to know
Tell me she's not the one

Asking myself, ""Bitch was this really worth it?""
What's my purpose I gotta keep searching
It was me and you Trina who asked the same questions
We decided when and which hoes we would fuck it
Shop wit thug wit get into some thug shit
Turn 'em on to niggas who deep into that thug shit
Get money fuck a little let a nigga touch a little
Had to make moves our home was so fucking little
Feel that? I know you do, 
guess what I wrote it too
Please recognize this is a hip hop quoteable
 + (over lapping the chorus)
(And even through the loneliest time
We survived through our loneliest nights
Just think about the struggling times
When we survived through a nickel and dime
And even if I had all the bread in the world
I'd give it all up for one shot at
You and Me, I'm that same bitch)

You and me were best friends but I'm the one you talk about?
I showed love to everybody before I walked about
The parties the club the function
I leave you bring up discussions on who I'm fucking
You and me were best friends we talked about abortions
As little girls hair braided o the same porches
We promised each other we would share the same losses
Ya baby daddy passed we share the same losses
It was you and me ho getting c-notes
Bell hoppers to the death while Irish hoes deep throat
Yeah it's beef in the air and why she know
If anybody do she know how we flow
Miami bitches you know how we go
Nice entourage lock mints wonder bras
Sit in the club I miss how it was
 + (over lapping the chorus)

You know it's really funny how the tables turn
I moved forward and thank God for the lessons learned
I used to strip clubs as a stepping stone
Hit the stage got paid it wasn't my second home
Ask somebody Trina been the shit on the streets
Roll wrap late nights been the shit on the beach
Brought blue baby jeans just to shit on the ?
Keep tall body guys just to sit underneath
Sit back pop bottle ya'll sit on ya'll feet
Screaming my name tryna get in V.I.P
I don't own the club boo
I'm just showing love too
But every time I see ya face I think of me and you
It's disappointing that you fell off well not fell off
I just can't accept you not being well off
It wouldn't be me if I didn't tell all
I even tried to call you but ya cell off

Let 'em into your brain brings misery and pain
Cause they call us lame, bitches, and heffers, and sluts
You think your nut is gonna heal my bruises and batters and cuts
Bitches ya'll better get tough
And at the same time y'all better lock the game
And re-rock the game
Get a Glock ready, sit back cock and aim
And try to stop the pain, cause you got a lot to gain
Instead of sittin home waitin on niggas to call
Puttin 911 in their beepers and all

You know what I'm saying? (Sexy gurl!)
Whatever they can give you, (laughs) I can give it to you times two
(Sexy gurl, but I really need you gurl!)
But in a gangsta way, can you dig it?

I woke up around ten o'clock this morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Put on my French-lace panties and my Enyce warm-up
I said, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the baddest bitch of them all?""
There was a quick pause
Then the mirror responded, ""You know you got it locked stop actin' retarded.""
Fa sho, that's why these bitches don't want beef
Cause I, flash the Roley with the all yellow deese
Got the sunflower-yellow on the fingernails
And the yellow Louie bag with the pastels
Yo I'm livin' like a model while my rap sales (Why?)
Cause niggas love the way my back swells
Plus I show my ladies how to mack males
Fuck posin' for BlackTail, I'm bout to sign a PlayBoy deal, unh

Come a little...

Close to the P-I- mpin'
Hop in the Coupe with Snoop go on a mission (mission)
Nonstop no intermission, breakfast in bed
We do head in the kitchen (ooooh!)
It's a lo-ve-ly day
You can hang out in the pool, act a fool or just bubble and bathe
And when you get it I love how you don't talk about me
But you lovin' the Dogg, that's what I like about it
M-I-A don't get in my way, the baddest bitch with the play-yi-yay (play-yi-yay)
And everyday I try to get my play on
This California lifestyle help you stay on (stay on)
I'm choppin' it up, (choppin' it up) I got the key so I'm lockin' it up (lockin' it up)
Flashin' 'em, (flashin' 'em) blastin' 'em (blastin' 'em)

Better than Fendi and Gucci
You need a little more for me to be a groupie (that's right)
How bout a house down out  on San Succi
Sittin' on an acre so we could move loosely
That's just how it goes
Vera Wang from the window pane down to the tips of my toes (Oh!)
And when I'm ready to leave I pull a Porsche out
Don't want no sticks or no seeds I go to Snoop's house 
Fuck a professor, I need an investor (unh huh)
To eat me like Hannibal Lector
And keep me in a pink Kompressor, cups processor
And I don't want nuttin' lesser


Let me holla at you baby
I know a lot of NFL players and a lot of NBA players (Sexy gurl!)

Feed Me Lies,The One,2019.0,"You say that you love me, you'll never leave me
It’s not that you don't want me, it's more like you need me
It sounds so smooth and so sweet and it goes down easy
All of these things just to keep me
You feed me your lies
Oh yeah, you feed me your lies
Go on and feed me your lies (Lies, lies)
Go on and feed me your lies (Lies, lies)
Go on and feed me your lies

You say a lot of things that don’t ever stick
If I described you, many words I could pick
Nothing to brag about, this affair done, over
I'm tired of compromising, done deal, it's over
Eventually my heart breaks, something you can't repair
So what I'm stickin' 'round for? 'Cause really there’s no love here
This relationship was built on a lie
My choir singin’ Mary J, I'm not gon’ cry

All the things that I did wrong, I apologized and you know that
Even when you say get gone, I turn around and I come back
And every time you throw the lie, I catch 'em all, running back
And now it's time I fumble and consider you a throwback, yeah

You say that you love me, you'll never leave me
It’s not that you don't want me, it's more like you need me

Go on and feed me your lies (Lies, lies)

Oh, she's just a good friend, and she was just a classmate
She just your sister's friend, and now you comin' from work late?
Now I'm seein' this makeup and lipstick on your collar
I already know the truth, save the lies, don't bother
While you been gettin' your groove on, I'm sittin' home, bein' housewife
You claim that you tired of bein' a player, you gon' do right
But all those lines musty and sooner or later they'll catch up
Say you'd never do it again, then turn right around and mess up

All the things that I did wrong, I apologized and you know that
Even when you say get gone, I turn around and I come back
And every time you throw the lie, I catch 'em all, running back
And now it's time I fumble and consider you a throwback, yeah

You say that you love me, you'll never leave me
It's not that you don't want me, it's more like you need me

Go on and feed me your lies (Lies, lies)
Go on and feed me your lies (Lies, lies)
Go on and feed me your lies

No, I'm not gon' cry, I'm just gon' let it
Burn, let it go, I'm not gon' sweat it (Yeah)
You played a lot of games, I feel like I regret it
Givin' all my heart to someone who wasn't ready
You were all I needed, don't stop me, 'cause I'm leaving (Leaving)
How you claim you love me, but I catch you cheating? (Cheating)
Thought I was so lucky (Lucky), but now I see no reason (Uh-huh)
So now I send you back (Back), to all of those you pleasing

You say that you love me, you'll never leave me
It's not that you don't want me, it's more like you need me

To stop grabbin' doorknobs, and hustle and rob

You eat me this evenin', you don't even deserve that

Mercedes Benz 6- double O havin' bitch, I'm fabulous
And immaculate with nice curves

Now where feelin' bad for all tha hoes you're goin' after
Looks can be deceivin', and you're poppin' much game
Crib in your moms name, claim of fortune and fame
Dressed in iceberg, sense still attached
Rockin' a gator, fake rolly, hollow links to match
I sit back and watch, as you dig yourself deeper
Digits all in your beeper, you want her, better keep her
Last night you was all up in the club, slingin' grips
Slippin' DJ Roslay, givin' dick tips away
Basically, you was holdin' like you just went pro
But little did they know, you was flossin' my doe
No, I got to go, before you 'cause a bitch to flick

I Got A Bottle,Still Da Baddest,2008.0,"I got a bottle, I got a cup
I got ice, so what's up
Walk in the club wearing superstar clothes
Feeling like money cause I collect dough
Moe, miney, meenie, inny
Where's that Patrone and Henny
Ass eater

I been sipping on cabonney that shits so strong
Like Paris Hilton, gotta carry me home
So full, so far gone
Forgot where I parked, and lost my iPhone
Still looking good and pretty, bad bitch in every city
Rocks, diamonds, I got plenty
Ice for the cup, now pour the Henny
Escorted in the club, I brought the whole team
Ain't no guest, but it's a rockstar thing
Everybody looking of course it's the queen
They admiring the crown, and the ten carat ring
I'm known for pimping these rappers
I should get an Oscar award for my acting
When they actually think that I'm feeling em
That's when I take they money, and I'm killing em


Watch me get ghost in the phantom
Something like a pimp like David Banner
I crooked letter, crooked letter, I crooked letta
Crooked letta I humpback humpback
I, am so off the chain
Buying bottles ain't a thing
Plus I'm gonna make it rain
So much money think she's insane
You a seven digit nigga if you holla at a broad
With a seven digit figga you should come in by the bar
I'm talking buying bottles, Cavalli Vodka
I'm wet and hot like lava
I'm switching four lanes in the Range
Hanging out the roof talking money ain't a thing
Coming all out my shirt on champaign
Damn lil Miss Trina off the chain


I splurge, I spend
Grab a pearl grand ten
I'm so stinky, stinky rich
My damn dogg drive a Benz
Powder blue, diamond shoes
Shining suits, Liberace boo
Stunting on you, like boo who you
I'm an icon ya bitch I though you knew
I only drop bombs, haters be like uh-uh
Girl who she think she is, I'm is what you want is
Girl I don't want your man but I'll take your man
Yo man and his friend they both my fans

Come on, all my fellas, let's get this money
It's only for all of us to get this money
Ain't no need for player haters acting funny
Come on, all my ladies, let's get this money
Come on, all my fellas, let's get this money
Trina finna show you how to get this money, right

You gotta have a J-O-B to be with me
Best believe I'm going diamond on my next LP
I stacked my game up, sexed my frame up
Bitches using my style, I'm set to change up
Unh, new year, new gray Jag
After the first album, you should hear Shay brag
I been around the world playing 2-way tag
While these wannabe Trinas out here claim bad
But guess what, I'm still the baddest
Jewels still flooded with 24 karats
OK, you know I live lavish
Chanel glass slippers in a Cinderella palace


Unh, unh, See me on South Beach rolling the five
When I come through hoes rolling they eyes
I'm the- baddest bitch, so I'm used to that
Draped in the hot shit off the Gucci rack
I like Tiffany ice, that expensive stuff
The diamond princess draped in princess cuts
Don't be mad ho, cause I'm that bad ho
Pushing that pink Lamborghini Diablo
I play niggas like dummies for the fast money
You wanna holla, it's gon' cost you cash money
Slip and slide, then we stacking chips
The redbone, wonder woman with the platinum wrist


Breakdown
Miami hot, 'Candy' flopped
I'm the new bad girl and I can't be stopped
Unh, sipping Bailey's, flossing daily
On TRL with Carson Daly
Dressed to kill, ice, extra chill
Touch of class, bad with the sex appeal
Flawless baby, female ballers baby
Stay diggin' in them millionaires wallets baby
Tored up, Christian Dior'd up
Cases of that Cris, gettin poured up
Got it sewed up, like stitches
Reppin' for my bad bitches, stackin' riches
I shine, baby cause the game is mine
I'm on top of the charts, no room to climb
And when I say I'm the baddest, I'm mean it

Yeah, look here Trina
I mean, me and you, we been friends for a minute but
You know how we get down, you know late night
You know, we do what we do we go our separate ways, but
Shit, lately, I been feelin' kinda different
Like, I been catchin' feelings for you and shit
You know when you call me Daddy and all that
Fuckin' with my head, for real

I never knew that I would fall so deep in love with her
Call me lover friend girl we was just hushin' it up
You got me feenin' for more
When other niggas used to call you after midnight
It never bothered me, girl we was only friends, right?
So why does it hurt more and more?
Girl I get excited whenever you call my phone
I got a special ringer whenever you call me girl it goes
""I can't leave you alone"" (remember that?)
You got me feenin' (yeah!) feenin' (shit) feenin'
So baby I'm pleading for you to bring your body home to me and let me lay you down

Bring your body home to daddy (bring it home)
Girl I love it when you call me daddy (love that shit)
Baby you're my sexy little mama (unh huh)
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on (yeah, yeah)
Bring your body home to daddy (say what, say what)
Girl I love it when you call me daddy (love it girl)
Baby you're my sexy little mama (you are)
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

I'm tired of the fightin' the fussin' and cussin'
Late night discussions of who you think I'm fuckin'
You puttin' me on guilt-trips like I can't see
You storin' his name for hers in your caller ID
Look I'm a Queen, the Don Diva
We should just flee in the lime green Seline two-seater you and me
My top down and yes my hair is blowin'
Flashbacks of you and me, got me moanin' but 
Who you lovin' who you wanna be huggin'
I seen her in your six hundred and you claim it's your cousin
Look I know we agreed to, to see other people
But those feelings were shallow like my lingerie see-through
We both played this game unfaithfully (that's right)
See me with the next man and now you wanna play with me
Yo' I'm confused but I still wanna proceed
Without you I'm incomplete, you make me so weak
I love it when you say...


I remember, late nights we would just kiss
I remember wearin' them girdles, and takin' them trips
And I remember that we said it would never come to this
Never let something come between our relationship
Now how can I leave you to be with someone else
Without finding out, how you truly felt
All the ridin' on horses and creepin' and abortions
Thoughts of marriage, all white playin' organs
It started from the rough sex (ah!) on the deck of the yacht
Followed by Don Perion and the Canary watch
All the shoes from Italy, it was cool
Even a villa in Sicily, but it wasn't me
But I should of made it crystal-clear that I didn't really care
Whether you was dead-broke or you was a millionaire
From our first date to our anniversary
My thoughts changed of leavin' when I heard you say to me...",https://genius.com/Trina-lil-mama-lyrics

Till mama sat me down unfold the gate
Showed me the straight path through the narrow lane
Sunshine after rain the joy of pain
Mama you raised a good girl dont worry
You used to say take it slow trina dont hurry
Use to tuck me in with the bedtime story
Now I grown up and you still there for me
My shoulder to lean on
You kept my dreams goin
I owe it all to you me now I got the green flowing
And im gon always be yo baby
And I  can't never repay you for all the things that you gave me
You raised me to be a lady
And you scoot me to the game so them niggas couldn't play me
You was more than a mother you was a friend
The greatest love of all comes from within
I know ill never kknow love like this again
And beneath my wings you was the wind
I love you like none other
Cause you can only live your whole life but only get one mother
Being there for me through the thick and thin
More than a mother your my best friend
Look within and take yo place
Sometimes I wanna run to ya
Through the ups and downs I know I can still come to ya
I think bout the things I done to ya
But through all the drama I know I'm still number one to ya
Uh, look at how far you brought me
All the things you have taught me
Money couldn't bought me
You never wanted us to make the same mistakes
When the game got high and they raised the stakes
You was still in my corner to press the brace
Till I'm ready in yo arms you kept me safe
Through the thick and thin im gon be there for ya
I say a prayer for ya
Lord knows I care for ya
Through hard times we got strong  or mother to daughter
When I was weak you was my bridge over trouble water
Can't nobody replace you
I'm forever faithful
For you mama im grateful
Your baby girl is a reflection of you
I thank the lord up above cause he blessed me with you, uh

Moonwalkin' in that pussy, you just need to Mike Jack it, uh
Clit-lickin' 'fore you get to dick-stickin' (Uh)
Grippin' it while you playin' ""Big Pimpin'"" (Uh)
Shit different, I can't finish this sentence
When you put the tip in it, ooh, you have my shit drippin', uh
Plus I ride face like a cowgirl (Cowgirl)
Soakin' wet, we gon' need to get a towel girl
Hope your neighbors know you dealin' with a loud girl

I'll dive for miles in you

Now let me put you on some new shit
You gon' be the water, baby, I'ma be the cruise ship
I know my neighbor gon' trip, know my neighbor gon' trip
Told her, ""You don't like the noise? You should move, bitch""
And I'm cool with PDA, E-A-T you freaky ways
Do it with the lights on, even let the TV play
Used to let the CD play, now a nigga digital
IPhone 7 already full of visuals
Candlelight vigil you
I just killed the pussy, may she rest in peace
Tongue and thumb in every hole, what's the recipe?
Respond back fast when she message me
'Bout to put my name on it, now she wreckin' me

Ain't scared to drown in you
Deep down in you, I love this water (Water)
Ooh, I love this water-water
I'll dive for miles in you
I'll do what I'm supposed to in this water
Ooh, I love this water-water

Titties sit right ass sit better
I'm mean in the thong behind this wooden leather
You can catch me South Beach in the drop top Carerra
In the middle of somebody dance floor like whatever, drop!
I keep it hood for you baby
Cause on the down-low mama know what's good for you baby
(What's good for me babe?)
Bottle of Henny for ya, me in a mini for ya
Show you some love, that's if I got any for ya
I could make it from the dollars to the pennies for ya
Back to back it it up and then I bend it for ya
But I don't come cheap
So you gotta break Trina off if you really want the right young freak
Pussy good, couple pumps, skeet skeet
But first I need that new Bentley
It should be a crime being this fine
And I get what I want I let 'em see it from behind, oh!

Want me to do my little dance for ya? (Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!)

Hair stay fixed, nails stay fixed
Keep niggas hotter than project grits
Paparazzi wanna know if I'm gay
Well I'm the reason why Shaq came to M-I-A 
Drop it like it's low your old man would of fainted on me
Maybe because the jeans look like they was hangin' on me
And my shoe game oh so vicious
I'm what your taste buds need cause I'm so delicious
Diamond Princess, how could you forget this?
Slip-N-Slide Records and the hood be my witness
I'm the baddest thing walkin' the block
And you the saddest thing stalkin' the cop
I'm Miss 305, butter pecan thighs
Pretty brown eyes in the 745 you could keep up with me
I'm the Diamond Mami drinkin' from a gold bottle
Grown women say I'm they role model, swallow that!


Now where my real bitches at that be takin' it off
And keep them playas straight breakin' 'em off
That's how you do that there
And Trina won't lie to ya
And sugarcoat it and it's fly to ya
It's like smokin' on a crib, lightin' up a dib
Poppin' one and puttin' some of me up on your lips, on your lips
And I ain't no better high than me baby
Call me sunshine cause you can touch the sky with me baby
Purses and shoes by Louie, Gucci
All from the pretty face and ghetto booty
What you want baby?
For me and you to do a porn baby
And tell you to beat it 'til the morn baby
I'm extra sexual and intellectual
Could do us both, just so professional
And I could wobbly on it
And take my phone calls like you can't bother me on it


 
Okay, kay, kay, kay
I keep it good for you baby
Cause on the down low mama know what's good for you baby, unh
I keep it good for you baby
Cause on the down low mama know what's good for you baby

If you see this vision, we can go real far
Further than the moon, I can be your superstar
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part

You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk
Bae, why you trippin'?
If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
I'ma hold you down, down

Ain't no bitch better, please
They all steal pieces for me, I'm the wet dream
What every man need, the viewers' choice, that's me
What you confused 'bout? What you need?
All and all, I'm a work in progress
So I never thought you, I can hand you off
Just prepare for everythin', steal the fortress
See I got you nigga, just don't make me regret
Opened up my heart for you, nigga
Let's get money, invest, make figures
Sail the ocean on yachts and shit, TMZ's tellin' lies
Let 'em snap a pic, so unfortunate
That they with you, knowin' me
We laugh at the bullshit, we one team
I tried to tell these niggas, I'm the truth from the start
But they don't seem to get their part

You might be crazy but I love it
Showin' off in public 'cause you drunk

If I keep you round, I'ma hold you down
And if I keep you round, I'ma hold you down

Gator boots by Sergio Rossi
Ms. Trina I got to splurge
Figure eight frame baby watch the curves
Walk in the club don't waste no time
Hit the bar up two cases of wine

Pick up the bag, the pistol will pump on my lap to pop ya!

Waiting for something that's wrong
Are you waiting
You know sometimes a girl must move along

As I vibe with the music, I just think about the times
I came in after a day and at times
Climbed in the same bed wished my man was lyin
He questioned me ""I'm I defying (no),"" I was lyin
He was a real good man, he worked and all
I wanted a hustle, so I can hurt the mall (shit)
I coulda made love, but I wanted to be fucked
He had a lot to offer it just wasn't enough
I like da candle-coated 'lac (uh huh) the niggas smokin sacks (i like da thugs)
The football games, fortunate and fame
And more importantly, I wanted me a name
The je-wells, the crew-es, the cell
No more projects, the foolish gets well (I'm tired of dat shit)
The (?) weed from Pre-me's on poken beans
And me, I'm still ghetto I push ah (?) when you see me on TV
But I'm all woman, uh
(Chorus 1x)

Yall know I'm from Miami right
But, do yall really know what Miami like
Miami life
Da fast pace, the comfy cash chase
Da clothes, cars, ohhh God
Niggas sell dope get rich
Bitches sell pussy get rich, get down or don't get shit (dats right)
No options, no college, no loans
No cash, No knowledge
I'm sexy as hell you know I'm gon profit
And trust me, my skills are well polished
I chat niggas down pat niggas down
Set him up right if he dat big a clown
I had to, well I didn't have to
But, what about me (sshhiitt) I had to have to
I wanted a Rolly a million dat'll hold me
Lock a access for Colby you know me (uh)
(Chorus 1x)

I'm da same woman, Mercedes or the Civic
Fuck the Cris, I just give it how I get it
I'm the spokesperson 4 ev'ry sista who soul seachin
Still strollin these clubs with no purpose
Stay in the mall and won't purchase
Straight boostin
Bad checks or they leasin they mouth
Robbers put a piece in their mouth
For whatcha man keep in their house
They pull gats for stacks tall as Shaq
You chickens don't know me well
I'm not impressed witcha Findi purses and ponytails
Always surface with your phony tails
When you need to be in school all day on a chase
I'm goin to work supported you and ur place
Or with a athletic wit a cool one in the safe
Why suck dick to keep food on the place
I (?) in baked potatoes take the payload

Wish I Never Met You,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Shonie)

I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you

When we first got together, I saw us chillin forever
A lifetime, best friend for worse or for better
Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds
I found a condom in ya dresser, and you know how we get down
You fucking clown now I wish I never met cha
I shoulda listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothing special
So now its to the left, to the left
And everything you own is on the porch
Nigga step and tell me …

What would you do if u were in my shoes?
Would you make it go go or would u wanna choose
Between the one you love and between the one u hate
Cuz that's just how it is …
I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you

Maybe im trippin, oh I just can't figure u out
One night u say u love me, the next u flippin out
But u can bounce, u kno I don't need a man
Im sorry I met u. I could do bad by my damn self
I can't let u disrespect me ima queen. And all my real
Boss chicks know what I mean
I bet u still trickin, you ain't learned ya lesson
Now let me check ya text messages … now tell me .. hahaaa

What would you do if u were in my shoes?
Would you make it go go or would u wanna choose
Between the one you love and between the one u hate
Cuz that's just how it is …
I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you
Picture me and u together
Everything about you make my whole body shiver
Its you I want in my world, its you that I adore
I said I picture me and u together
Everything about you make my whole body shiver
Its you I want in my world, its you that I adore
What would you do if u were in my shoes?
Would you make it go go or would u wanna choose
Between the one you love and between the one u hate
Cuz that's just how it is …
I wish I never met you boy …
And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world
I wish I never met you boy …
If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo
I wish I never met you boy …
Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you
Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you",https://genius.com/Trina-wish-i-never-met-you-lyrics

I got a, fat pussy for a cocksucker
I got a, hideout for a cop ducker
I got a, condo for a baller nigga
I got a, gay friend you can call her nigga

I got a, dick game with a mean hustle
I got an, Escalade no you can't touch it
I got a, couple blocks up in Georgia nigga
I got a, lil' brother cookin quarters nigga

I got a, couple girls who gon' come fuck
I gotta, see the money time to come up
I gotta, keep it real with my hustler hoes
I got a, pump or two, who gon' boost them clothes
 + (Trina)
I gotta get mine, girl you gotta get yours
(I gotta get mine, boy you gotta get yours)
I gotta get mine, girl you gotta get yours
(I gotta get mine, boy you gotta get yours)

I gots, no love for a punk bitch
I gotta, cuss her out to make her suck dick
I got a, dildo in this bag baby
I got a, lil' somethin for that ass baby

I know you, pay hoes cause I heard you did
I got a, headhunter that'll serve you quick
I got a, team of hoes you ain't seen befo'
With green to blow, sick with cash and cream fo' sho'

I gotta, fuck 'em all just cause I can
I got her, much hotter than fuckin her own man
The Ramada, she gave me a hundred dollars for head
But my Pradas, were slipped on, I got knee and fled


I got a, couple cars, while most hoes sob
You gotta give it to the nigga who wrote those bars
I got a, check in the mail that you couldn't believe
Now I got a Roley for 80 G's under my sleeve

I gotta, let you hoes know who I be
So instead of sayin Rick Ross I just pull out B's
I got a, trap in the hood called no ID
All my weed guaranteed, maybe fo' five seeds

I gotta, put it down in a major way
I gotta, put y'all down with this game I play
I gotta, get my pussy ate like everyday
Bring the present with the cake in ya Escalade


I got an, AK for a bitch nigga
I gotta, let you know they only get bigger
I got a, hit man for your problems nigga
I got a, couple stacks that'll solve him nigga

I gotta... show my nigga love
Cause he my nigga what, now hold yo' triggers up
Ain't nuttin in this game is as big as us
If it is, you can tell 'em, we don't give a fuck

I gotta, hit 'em hard like Ronnie Lott
Defended by Johnny Coch' cartel on the block
I got a, fifty cal' and I'm waitin in the crowd

Tell the world how you smile in it
He don't hesitate, he just dive right in it
Ooh, kill it, I don't get a break for a minute
Shit, I be lookin' like, ""Stay another minute, ooh""

Underneath the honeymoon, no lights

This is the mother fuckin roll call so listen up
All the ladies, nubian queens
Black princesses, african godesses, choir girls, young girls, models
Skeezers, bitches, hoes, players, dikes, divas, house wives, gold diggers
Sex chasers, cum guzzlers, chicken heads, crack heads, baller bitches
Shake dancers, and boosters
Say what you want, we're all one in the same
No matter what they call you, or you call yourself
Theres only 3 rules in this game:
Keep your nappy-ass hair done, do your mother fucking sit-ups
And whenever you lay on your back, make sure your paper is stacked
And with all that said and done, diamond princess
Take this shit to another level",https://genius.com/Trina-intro-sommore-lyrics

Capricorn,Amazin’,2010.0,"I wanna take this time out from rapping right now
And share something really personal to the world
I wanna dedicate this to my baby
Since I know that he listening , I'm gone always be your girl
See maybe y'all never been in love like I've been in love
And maybe you've never felt the things that I've felt
See I've never had this tingle inside from a man
Feels like he makes my heart melt
I mean the way that he looks at me
Is a look I've never got from another brother
He's cool, got swagg, calm, collective
And you know what else? He's a damn good lover
See, he knows what it takes to keep a smile up on my face
And he knows when I'm feeling uncomfortable and our relationship is out of place
The taste of his lips, the swagg in his walk
How he's so disciplined, ambitious and the way that he talks
A capricorn, hmm hmm hmm, stole my heart and I don't even want it back
He can have it, he can have it, he can have it, he can have it
Cause he got it like that

He can have it baby, he can have it
Oh yeah, he can have it

So independent, focused, and he knows how to love
Who would have dreamed in a million year it would be you that I'd be speaking of
The tenth sign of a zodiac one of the most serious and stable, reliable, responsible
And the characteristic that I like most is ladies he always ready, willing, and able
Now when God created him I know he had to be in good mood
Because my man gives me the utmost respect
And ladies he's never disrespectful and he's never rude
Loving, caring, and giving; he's all of the above
I just wanna say thank you God for giving me all I've been dreaming of
I feel like Cinderella when she found her prince
I can't remember I was looking for love but I ain't been looking since
My capricorn, my capricorn, my capricorn

My capricorn, my capricorn, so sexy

His charm, his motivation, his patience
All combine together as one man, my man
Strong, but careful of every move that he makes
All the steps that he takes, real not fake
The Capricorn, the Capricorn, the capricorn
That's all I ever needed, all I ever wanted
So I took this time out of my life to let you know how I was feeling about my capricorn
My Capricorn, my capricorn, my capricorn
Baby I love you, your love's waiting here for you
So whereever you are, whatever station that you listening to right now, I'm here
Somebody call my capricorn home for me
Or better yet, I'll do it myself",https://genius.com/Trina-capricorn-lyrics

Yeah, I’ve come too far, to turn back now
Trina
I’m too far, 305, to turn back now, yeah, aha
But I don’t know, I’ve come too far, I’ve come too far yeah, too far
Don’t know how yeah
Giuseppe's never looked so nice on a queen
The ghost pod’s reflection, the hairy glisten bling
Standing ovations and the sold out show days
I’ve been winning since recording a dat tapes
So what a bitch hate, that’s what they made for
And I’m the competition I’m what they can’t fuck
Prolific, profound and gifted, I don’t hear these bitches
Bopping so I don’t get tempted
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me
Stirred up, body chemist cooking chemistry
I can’t be duplicated so they all choose to follow me
These birds are pictures of trash and fire and when my pen
Losses ink, that’s the day I retire, I never expire
I pray to a God that’s higher, he promised me a long time
He give me all I desire

I’m too far, to turn back now
You know I’d reach the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m too far, to turn back now
You know I’d reach the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m sitting on airplanes/spaceships
I’m an astronaut, with real curf tips
Million dollar whips, I take space trips
I sip starbucks and spend space chips
I play 50 cent moka I’m on vh1
Now tell me something that a bitch done that I ain’t done
To not be feeling left out like I am the one
Fuck an award, it’s political
I’ve been hot as the sun
I’ve been getting to the money like it’s nothing
I’ve been rocking Chanel no per diem no budget
I’m on my own shit and you hoes no money
I can’t take you under cause you thirst for the money
Bitches never had nothing till the game gave it to em
And now they getting money, look how the game do them
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how
I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how
If you was thinking that it was over
Leprechaun, here’s my 4 leaf clover
But I don’t need luck, I’ve been prayed up
While they was sleeping, I’m the same bitch who stayed up
While I’m most consistent, why the rockstars love me
Why I’m on my 6th album, why your man wanna fuck me
Why the movie screen calling, why I ain’t stop balling
Why you throwing sneak disses if I really ain’t the target
Why they throw me on the cover, why my ass so fat
Yeah my ass is a movie, you should see it from the back
And it’s hd, high definition
If I never started rapping, all this ass you’d be missing
You’d be in the same position, listening to corny bitches
All the lies that they telling and the fantasies they wishing
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

I’m too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don’t know how

Yellows, reds and blues watch the ice dangle
Colorful things, full beams, no illusions
VVS clean gleam, no inclusions
Glamorous with the gangsta twist
Gucci on the hip, butta Lucci on the wrists
And we off glass, we glistenin', you listenin

You thinking I'm a dime, but I'm a silver dollar

Do I, cook or clean, daddy? I hire for that
Need a housewife, that ain't Eve
My business come first
I think you'll understand
After you listen to this one verse
Always been a bitch about mine
And fuck with winners
Me and Trin' top of the line, nigga listen
Keep these chicks praying we stop
It never happen
Sitting back, wishing that they never started rappin'
Too late, hurting 'em hard, what you wanna do
Stop what, fuck out the way
Watch how we come through

You see can't too many hoes, come after me
I have to be in the Jacob or the masterpiece
It take cash to speak, I never had to lease
Between me and the girls
We need at least half the fleet

But look long as you want
Who stronger than this clique?
From one minute, two minutes, I'm in it

Yo, I'm a diamond in the rough
See I roll from the slum
Any little old city is like nowhere to run
The game's on you till you stand on your own two
Check this out niggas---This is what we gonna do
1!!!- We gon' bang this
2!!!- We gon' sing this
3!!!- We on top of the world but we ain't saying shit
It's the movement, and the truth is
Cause Trina and Missy ain't gots to prove shit
We brake down floors (BAM!!)
Brake down doors (BOOM!!)
5 month tours just brake down do'
We brake down hoes, we brake down foes
Run through pockets just straight down yo's
M-I-A to V-A its real y'all
We shakin up bottles to let 'em spill y'all
This is Slip-N-Slide askin ""What the deal y'all?""
If you ain't throwin them bows then I don't feel y'all

I Said BOY!!!! REWIND THAT BACK
If you talk *shit* yo might get slapped
BRRRRRRRAAHHHH!!! Yup I said slapped
Ain't no other chicks that's gon' bring it like that now
BOY!!! REWIND THAT BACK
Up in the spot you got your Glocks on lock and
HEY!!!--This join gon' knock
Up in the club I said this joint don't stop

Y'all know how real woman come down
Low cut copes when Trina come round
Reggae DJ screamin ""COME DOWN!!""
We ?? it off top but want some now
Sit back-- and praise the don diva
I'm ?? --  trust me I'm gon' leave ya
Who blows streets up? Ya man want eat us?
Different flows,flavors,hoes- No Favors!
Don't pay us we'll shut that down
What's that loud? (Owww!!)  Cut that down!
Got a CL6 but what's that now?
If he not talkin big money, Fuck that clown!
Excuse my french, I won't stress the issue
If he ain't lookin out he's just messin with you
I'm a Mercedes mami, maybe the Lex official
If you wanna get on I'll have Flex to hit you


Damn Y'all-Da-Da-Da-Da Damn yall!
Hurtin and scurrin I'm like I took my panties off
Knuckle and Buckle em' nigga I ain't scared of y'all
You wrestle this muscle thats gon' be your damn fault
YOW!!!!!-- I make screams like Prince
Spay em' and lay em' but you gon' never touch this
Beat em' don't eat em but you gon' always need Miss (Miss)
Cause me and Miss Trina gon' always switch it like this
COME ON!!!!",https://genius.com/Trina-rewind-that-back-lyrics

Look At Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I got an ass so big like the sun
Hope you got a mile for a dick, I wanna run
Slap it in my face, shove it down my throat
Nigga, where your blunt? I can make this pussy smoke
I know how to fuck, I know how to ride
I can spin around and keep the dick still inside
Now your mouth wide, you looking real scared
I'm a maneater, headhunter, I'm prepared
Yeah you running now, you running
I'ma put this pussy on you just like this
Put this pussy in yo jaws now, smack
Like it's Thanksgiving and it ain?t coming back
Collard greens, neckbones, nigga chew this ass
Both hold inspections, don't stop 'til it pass
Licky licky licky licky licky for a hour
I'ma make it rain for you here's a golden shower
Smell it like a flower, my pussy is a rose
Come a little closer, I wanna fuck your nose
If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict
Look back at me, look back at me

Thoroughbred red broad in my bed
Up all night, took pipe, gave head
Ass like Trina, face like Mya
Shot it on her chest she said, ""Daddy, aim higher""
Put jimmy on her titties and I bust off wicked
Gave her mayonnaise on the face, pearl necklace
We turned the camera on we did a sex scene
She called me R. Kelly and I called her
That?s my bitch right there nigga
Hand full of ass and a fist full of weed
Ass in the air, face down on your knees
I'm a beast when I fuck, I'ma put it in your gut
I'ma have you saying, ""No, please, let me get off""
I'ma make you say that's the spot don't take it out
I'm feeling like Akinyele, put it in your mouth
Kanye tell them gold digging hoes that we pimping in the South
And it ain't payday unless nuts in your mouth
If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it
Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict
Look back at me, look back at me

Flip it, rub it up and smack it, look back at it, I'm a addict
(Look look look look)
Back at you for what?
I'm trying to concentrate on busting me a nut
I'm thinking about Trav, I'm thinking about Bo
Little dick nigga, shit, hurry up, I gotta go
Since they in prison pussy nigga make me know
That you ain?t a virgin, ain?t you done this before?
Fuck me 'til you can't breath, 'til you swim and scream help
It?s your lucky day all the lifeguards left
Little dick ass nigga
You better get your face down here and eat this pussy
Dribble these titties on your lips
While you're doing that put your hands around my hips
Bounce me like a ball, slam me like K-Mart
On and off the dick better known for breaking hearts
Nigga call a cab I'm finna pack my shit and leave
Shouldn't have let you fuck, now that?s some shit I can't believe
Wasting my time fucking all off beat
Pussy nigga next time when you see me don't speak
If you want it you can get it, if you with it I'ma hit it

You are my world (my world)
You look so sweet
You're a special treat

Wow ta dow watch out now
It's lil' Briana no I'm not Bow Wow

Sweet like cinnamon with the candy swirl
I'm like sugar and spice
My flow so nice
Colorful ice like rainbow bright
I'm that candy girl sweet like a life savor
Got more flavors than a pack of Now or Laters
Ten years old the baby diva
The kids at school call me baby Trina
When I step on this track it make your fingers snap
And do the peanut butter jelly with the baseball bat


I taste like candy a candy treat
So sweet from my head down to my feet
This song's dedicated to my candy girls
The life of luxury the candy world
With candy benz's marble floors
Cartier kisses and cash galore
With candy toys candy yacht's
Candy verses and candy four dots
No it don't stop and we on the rise
To slip and slide and diva enterprise
We drop candy hits that's how we bring it
I'm a candy girl come on Stef sing it


I'm a candy girl and my flow too hot
Sweet like lollipops and gumdrops
Gummy bears Skittles and Kit Kats
I'm a young girl running this game you with that?
I got more flavors than Starburst
I keep my penny candy in my Prada purse
If I act too sassy pardon me y'all
I be playing with Barbie dolls in my carnegie hall
I'm a good good girl a candy girl
The baby Diva with the baby doll pearls
If you ain't come to party we ain't having that
So do the Donkey Kong and the cabbage patch",https://genius.com/Trina-kandi-lyrics

Pretty rare!
Ain't no nothing petty!
Pretty light and I'm gone
X on in my phone
But tonight I'm in my zone
(Tonight I'm in my zone!)
Said he needs some attention, I don't have time
I found out he be tricky, so I'm about mine
So I'm riding, riding in that beamer
Drop top, two seat up
He care about me, so I'm stressing him either!
Probably send them diamonds
Got them bitches shining
Got the whole club watching, and I wasn't even trying
Bunch of bad bitches rocking, money in our pocket
You can hate it, you can love it
But I bet that you won't stop it!
(Hold up!)
Name is not an option, we always get it popping
When you're bad and you're bossy, you always get on top!

Got ‘em yelling pretty rare
I don't need your money, nigga get me head!

Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty!
I just made it rain, I'm so benevolent
Fuck the other side, they're so irrelevant, yeah
Teach you hoes a thing or two about elegance
You don't fit my standards, up your measurements
The Louis Vuitton I'm stepping in
She's basic and I'm excellence
Work hard but I make it look effortless
And that top spot is my residence!
Murder everything and leave no evidence
Them rock stars I represent
Jump up and running ever since
Got hits, baby, check my record list!
My bank roll is indefinite
That means I got no limit
My.. is so expensive and I keep them custom fitted
I'mma always go and get it
It ain't nothing about me timid
See I told them I'mma make it
And I live it cause I did it!

Swag on a million, come prepared
Good life, glam life, living in!
Ain't no nothing petty!
I'm turned up and I'm going in
It can't be, I feel it rolling in!
They got my spot, ain't no controlling in
You're just a flock, you wasn't born to win!
Play your role, that, that ground
I got the heat, I told them back down
I keep it a hundred, don't bring your act round
Cause I'm from the street, I ain't talking rap now!
I just wanna rock, rock, I'm feeling in
I'm sinustage, I'm killing it
I'm on that piece of… I'm feeling it

Girl we could go to Phipps {?} and get to poppin tags
Or we could ball through the mall, tear shoppin bags
And take you straight to the tail so I could chop that ass

I'll fuck you from the back done pinched yo' nerve and yo' neck
That pussy so good you deserve you a check
You want that ice on your hands with the birds 'round your neck

I'm a trap cook crack up in the kitchen nigga
But I will lay pipe 'til that coochie dead
Nigga squirtin on curtains and Gucci spreads


I need a, sugar daddy baller
That go to Belle Harbor and tear the mall up
Uhh, I need a D to call up
To break me off and tear these sugar walls up
Heidi Floess is what they call her

Spoiled and rich, a ghetto Kelly Osbourne
You know I'm in demand, you see me in Japan
I'm leanin on your man, my jeans worth a grand
I'm still the baddest and you knowin that
And if I, give it to you would you throw it back?

Little slide to her talk

I ain't no regular broad, I ain't scared at all
Like Bone Crusher, I'll crush your bones
When I come through strong with my big big brone
Riding spinners like Three 6 do
Let me do me, nigga, you do you
Suck this clit till my shit turn blue
Put a bitch to sleep, wake me up when you're through
I'ma get dressed so fresh, looking new
And it's back to the Chevy or the cab for you
Chucking deuces, switching lanes
Riding that donk and sitting on things
You ain't never ever met a bitch like me
And your bitch ain't never ride a dick like me
Check the paint, watch the feet
Inches 26's deep
Candy dripping on the street

You supposed to like me, dog, 'cause I'm what you wanna be
From top to bottom, being trill that's something that's in me
It's a hell of a feeling to know you a 100% real nigga
I've been out here getting money since I was a little nigga
I'm loved by these hoes, respected by these killers
It took years of thugging to get to this point, nigga
I don't know if you know how it feels to walk around with stacks
I've been broke and came up and I ain't going back
'Cause money get you friends, choppers get you respect
Respect out here in these streets, I got a lot of that

And once I put my game down his main bitch is through
My ass fatter when I make it clap, oh, that's when shit get real

Therefore I do whatever I feel, I know that Cali kill
Play with that green, stay on that grind, like happy grin
More money equal more power, my power's getting me more money

Do you really wanna know what hard work is? Ask me and I'll tell you
From nothing to something
If there is a will there is a way
Traveling city to city, state to state
Non stop shows, interviews all over the globe
I am Miami
Magazine covers, gossips number 1 topic
The life of the rich and famous
Fans who can relate, from the beginning till now
Trashy mouth, too sophisticated lady
Not just a rapper but a businesswoman still standing
When I've seen others come and go, I rise
Grateful for my struggles and the road that I took
It only made me stronger, it prepared me for this
For the here and now, focused and eager to learn
Fast to teach, this is not a game
This is my life
Fairy tales don't exist over here, I'm a realist
And strong is just another statement to describe me
And now I ask you the same question again
Who is Trina?  She is amazing
I'm amazin', so amazin'
I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
I'm amazin', I'm amazin'
I'm a...

Your psychic is wrong, tell that chick I sang this song
I own the throne, any other chick she follow
I'm her role model, I don't use a bottle
I breast feed the game like there's tomorrow
I can tell you about pain and talk about sorrow
Bitches ain't shit and niggas ain't either
Niggas want ya chick, better watch the way you treat her
You shouldn't have to beat her
Lose her the way you meet her
When a woman's fed up, better watch the way you treat her
I'm way past a diva, I'm outta ya league
I'm something ya need, I'm front page, something to read
I said I'm way past a diva, I'm outta ya league
I'm something ya need, a front page, something to read

To have and to hold from this day forward
For better or for worse
For richer for poorer
In sickness and in health
To love and to cherish
Form this day forward
Until death do you part
Uh!
I guess I wasn't enough for you
The things I done for you
Call me I run to you
Whenever you want me to
What have I done to make you hurt me a time or two
Probably more then a few
My heart still beats for you
Wonder what did I do
Damn I should've knew
But still didn't have a clue
My life would be so blue
Yeah I'm hurt it's true
Not feeling me next to you
Laughing at things you do
Kissing and calling me boo
Now it's hard to eat
Damn I feel so weak
And I can't get no sleep
My eyes continue to leak
Pouring out like the rain
This hurts more then pain
Apologizes with the pain
I went against the brain
Baby please don't go
I need you more n more
I'm breaking down on the floor
One thing you should know
Is that I got you
No matter who tells you that
The love we had was wack
Know that I need you back here
Baby Don't go Don't go 
Baby Don't walk away
Baby Don't go Don't go 
Just stay with me
Cause if you leave baby baby you'll be breaking my heart
And if you leave baby baby I'll be torn apart
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
From me
Uh
So baby tell me that this ain't true
I open my heart to you
I changed the game for you
Gave up my friends for you
My life just ain't the same
I'm Reaching n calling your name
Remember the things I do
Cooking and cleaning for you
Taking good care of you and
Making sweet love to you
Baby just close your eyes
And picture my hips and thighs
Laying right next to you
I'm getting the best of you
Tell me you need me back
I promise I'm running right back
How did It come to this
Why did you run from this
My loving you got to miss
With you I was full of bliss
Baby please don't go
I just can't take no more
I'm screaming and kicking
Cause really I needs to know
Tell me she's not the one
Tell me I'm number one
And baby can you please tell me and you are still one
Baby it's tough love
Cause you been rough on me
I really miss the way you used to put that dick on me
Baby Don't go Don't go 
Baby Don't walk away
Baby Don't go Don't go 
Just stay with me
Cause if you leave baby baby you'll be breaking my heart
And if you leave baby baby I'll be torn apart
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away (Don't walk away)
From me
Can't you see
What the hell you doing to me
I'm soaking wet (In tears)
Crying baby (over you)
All on my knees
I'm begging and pleading not to leave
So say that you'll stay (say that you'll stay)
Baby please stay (Pleaseee Stay)
Baby Don't go Don't go 
Baby Don't walk away
Baby Don't go Don't go 
Just stay with me",https://genius.com/Trina-dont-go-lyrics
Make Way,Amazin’,2010.0,"I'm just tryna make sure that you hear me out there
Now when you see the queen coming
And the horn start blowing
(Ay yoh Trina)
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
(It's been a while baby
But they still gotta bow down to the queen, ha-ha yea)

Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa
They see the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
Recognize this woman, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way

Every time I turn the t.v. on, all I see is Trina
Everybody so quick to judge me
Look how you point the finger
Saying he's to good for me when you don't even know me
You're too lonely, you need to worry bout yours only
Like a rag you throw me
Some pretend they don't know me
BET you know you owe me, show me homie
Tryna steal my pride, they make me go harder
Do I worry? I don't bother
I'ma finish what I started
Working more than 9 to 5
Keeping the Slip-n-Slide dream alive
Look at some of these chicks that try
Half of them lost their flame, they died
While I been walking on fire
I'm yearning to go higher
Never kicked out the game, I shall retire
Now put that on The Wire
I grab the game like pliers
I'm doing the whole dash, staring like I'm wearing tires
Can't  studio to stage
My people gotta make way
For queen before I clear the streets

Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa
They see the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
Recognize this woman, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way

What makes you think this life more easier for me
If you can only see, it ain't all that is crack up to be
More money, more problems when you living like this
If you ain't making hits, then you ain't about shit
Fans go to talking, the neighbors go to shopping
Am I'm really human?  when I go to 
Huffin' an the puffin', tears start fallin'
The the whole turns cold
That's when you wanna pick your coffin
But I ain't giving up, I ain't never be a quiter
I go hard on everything, I'm a natural born winner
Natural born sinner but I'm praying for forgiveness
Some-times I pinch myself then I realize I live this
Some say relentless, I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch myself and than I realize I live this
Some say relentless, I say forgiveness
That's when I pinch myself and then I realize I live this

Now when you see the queen coming
And all the horns start blowing
Everybody start running
People in the streets coming
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way whoaaaa
They see the fireworks blowing
And the roof start smoking
And you know it ain't a game
Recognize this woman, make way
Make way, make way, make way
Make way, make way, make way, way",https://genius.com/Trina-make-way-lyrics
Takin Over Ladies,Rockstarr Royalty ,UnKnown,"Yes! I am the queen
Feed me diamonds
I don’t need a king
A couple mill, work the bling
Plus my back shot mean
And I’m fresh out the coupe
I’m bout to kill the scene!
Blah! Chicks get back! The Baddest Chick back!
And I’mma make it real hard for ya’ll to come back!
I’m flyer than the sky!
New coupe with the top back!
Damn! I’mma bad chick
But ya’ll already know that!
And I’m undefeated
Blowin’ kisses at you haters cause I’m Miami heated!
Tired of playin’ with you lames
I’m shutting down the game
Hope you had a lot of fun
With your little bit of bank
Beat the drum, blow the horn
For the queen of the south
Heres a new Louis bag for you to shut your mouth!
Roll out the red carpet!
Bring the trumpets out!
Cause the word on the street says I own the south!

If you really want it, baby we got it
We got the fire, you’ve been waiting for
Homies done did it, but watch how we get it!
You can't keep a strong woman down for long
Cause we taking over
All of my ladies
Cause we taking over
It’ll be crazy
We takin over
Don’t even try to hate
Wish a nigga would!
I’m still hood
Damn right!
(Think I ain’t taking over)

Jackie-O, Jack, Jack the ripper
Big spender, showing love to the strippers
Time for a zippa, sang the song
Can’t be a queen if you ain’t gotta throne
I hear you knocking but nobodies home
You peaking through my window
Sitting in your windows, I’m gone
I’m in the fast lane, on any corner
And I’m breaking the crack game
You know we keep it real B!
Hoods feel me! One false move
Take you out your misery!
I give ‘em more bounce to the ounce!
I’ma show ‘em things they can't even pronounce
I talk greasy, I know what the hands do
H2 and I'm blowing trees like yancy
Detroit brick sanders, queen of rap!
Say my name, I’ll blow you off the map!

Cause we taking over
All of my ladies
Cause we taking over
It’ll be crazy
We taking over
So don’t even try to hate
Wish a nigga would!
I’m still hood
Damn right!
Cause we taking over

I am that bitch!
Stunt on niggas! Stunt on chicks!
I like to smoke
I need some crip
I got hoes
I need a strip
I got coke
I need a flip
Why sell O's when I got bricks?
I just get the dough, dont even touch the shit!
And if I blaze, always the purple pip
See the girl how I sets it on fire
I write more than your ghost writer
Ma you're not hard, your vagina
Your a bone thug, you’re not a fighter
Mic check, my check, your provider
You memorize well
You're a good reciter
See, the clock ticks and now its my time-a
I’m the best female rhymer!
Ya dig?

If you really want it, baby we got it
We got the fire, you’ve been waiting for
Homies done did it, but watch how we get it!
You can't keep a strong woman down for long
Cause we taking over
All of my ladiez
Cause we taking over
It’ll be crazy
We takin over
Don’t even try to hate
Wish a nigga would!
I’m still hood
Damn right!",https://genius.com/Trina-takin-over-ladies-lyrics

We could write a new book call it sex reinvented
Or sohuld we make a movie, sold to public arena
I'll let you start up my motor
See this real fat engine
Now let's start with some foreplay
Felation, 69 daddy, we could do that all day
And louboutins that's the best way
And when I drop the trenchcoat, can you promise me a long day
Cause I'm a rider, put that thing inside
I bet I make it grip, like I'm gripping you with plyers
Them bitches liars, ain't nothing bad as this
Got niggas eating this, call a nigga pie up

Boy keep doing what you doing, don't slow it down

Showing Out,Amazin’,2010.0,"Uh huh, yeah now this is for all the sexy ladies, show out
Now I am, I am Trina, Trina, 2010, yeah, I'm showing out

Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out
Shawty showing out, she showing out, she showing out
She showing out, she showing out, shawty showing out

He ain't never seen a 5 star lookin' like this
He ain't never had me, I'm as good as it gets
Got a small thick frame, I spit a lot of game
305 representer of glass off the chain
I'm in the flyest fashion 3-6-5
And ain't no doubt about it, yeah I'm all the way live
See I push a brinks truck so I'm always on full
I ain't waitin' on those lies, 40 acres and a mule
The boys see me comin', you should see 'em make it rain
They get wild with them hundreds, they no 50's ain't my thang
Cute face, nice ass with a lot of class
Them birds stay jealous 'cause they back door trash
Rear view in the past, never let 'em see you comin'
They know I'm in the spot when the crowd start runnin'
I'm carried by the pharaohs, new home out in Melrose
She showin' out again, she the queen baby, hello

Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out
Shawty showing out, she showing out, she showing out
She showing out, she showing out, shawty showing out

He tryna floss for a boss, chicks spendin' all his cash
Takin' me wherever, told me, ""Throw it in the bag""
We went to Bel Harbor, man I made him spend a house
Told him ,""Show me what you got, you a man or a mouse""
He said he a man I said, ""Show muscle""
He pulled the black card out and said, ""I ain't gon' rush you
You can take your time, get whatever that you  like
And when you finish shoppin' baby, we'll depart and take flight""
I could pick the country where I wanna land
'Cause I was showin' out, he wanna be my man
Wanna take me to Germany, spend a week out in London
Buy me homes out in Paris just 'cause I'm givin' good lovin'
See it's all about me 'cause I'm that he needs
All that money he spends, you'll think it grow out on trees
How I shop out in Italy then I'm back out in Paris
He love my neck to be flooded, a hundred K worth of diamonds, I'm showin' out

Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out
Shawty showing out, she showing out, she showing out
She showing out, she showing out, shawty showing out

Yeah, when I step out, I always keep them lookin'

Showing out everyday like it ain't nothin'

You see we in the bank, I could never draw it out
'Cause it will take too many days just to have them count it out
Hopin' out whatever 'cause you know I stay stuntin'
You see me in the club, you know I'm showin' out
You see me in the mall, you know I'm showin' out
You see we in the bank, I could never draw it out
'Cause it will take too many days just to have them count it out, I'm showin' out

Shawty shut it down when she step on the block
Make me wanna reach into my pocket and throw out all my singles
All my singles, she showing out, she showing out

Skyline,UnKnown,2017.0,"Baby, I done spent a million in a week
There ain't nothin' as pretty as your smile
Looks like the skyline
Check

Anythin' that you want, anythin' that you could have
I ain't window shoppin', shawty, throw it in the bag
I'm from the bottom of the map, I made from the top
The skyline bluer than the blocks in my watch
My baby scream my name (Ross) every time it rains
I know she feel my pain, shawty, nothin' goes in vein
All I do is smile at the bumps and the bruises
Cruisin' in the coupe, or jump in a Land Cruiser
Our relationship is far more sacred
Success complicates it, so back to the basics
Wishin' I could buy time
Eyes closed just picturin' the skyline

If you wanna go up high
I'll make it worth your while
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Carry the ocean on in privacy
If you wanna go up high
Like diamonds in the sky (you know my view)
To the penthouse suite, just you and me (that's what's important to me
Pull the curtains back so you can see (skyline)
The skyline
All this for me? Skyline
I'm lovin' it, skyline
You could be anywhere in the world right now, skyline
But you with me

I done heard it all from the ying to the yang
I done brought it all, Louis V to Vera Wang
I went from coach to first class on all flights
Then coach to Hermes, all ice
I put my life in this music and been around the world
Most men are losers, I put that on my words
Like my top in the summertime, nigga, get lost
I need fresh air, so it's time to take off
I might get a massage, I might have a menage
I might sit back and watch and play like I'm LeBron
Baby still the bomb, you ladies not a threat
When I detonate a man, whole face went
You better check yourself 'cause I could write a check
My skyline blue so my view is the best
I was 17 in the blue VVS
You didn't have a clue, greyin' shoes was a mess
Shine comes with time, mine came with grindin'
Every day I'm alive, I'ma put it on the line

If you wanna go up high
I'll make it worth your while
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Carry the ocean on in privacy
If you wanna go up high
Like diamonds in the sky
To the penthouse suite, just you and me
Pull the curtains back so you can see
The skyline

I'm visualizing, me and you on an island
Black sand, holding hands, and covered in diamonds
Look up in the sky it's a unicorn
And I can't get enough of how you do me boy
I see me ripping off your clothes, kissing on your chest
I'm down to your stomach so you know what's coming next
My fantasy, a trip, I'm thinking bout the hot spot
Late night, skype conversations from the laptop
Got your t-shirt on, your cologne on it
Make me feel like you still right at home in it
Check your phone come help me take off this negligee
And he replied with a lol smiley face

Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Thinking of you, I'm thinking of you
All I can do, is just think about you
Think about you, think about-

And I'm legs up, arms back
Squeezing on your thighs
Make that ass feel fat
I'm just visualizing it, you telling me where it's at
I'm a put my mouth on it, whatever to get it wet
Cause I just wanna see you smile when it's over with
Lay in bed and talk about how we grow and shit
First kiss upon your neck then go to your hip
Dynamite dick, how you think Napoleon hit
Bomb, you be looking bomb
Dress good, smell good, that should be a crime
Even on skype I'm checking you from behind
And you could have the world
As long as I know you're mine
Girl I'm thinking of you

The way you hold me down
The way you put that tongue on me
You know my facial expressions, boy, when I get horny
You're such a monster
You make the pussy cry
When I can't stop moaning
You already know why
Cake keep bouncing, and I keep on announcing
That it's all yours
Make me drip like a fountain
Wet aquafina, bedroom ballerina
Waterfall, make me come
Now throw me that ah
Bed ringer, hot topic
I'm thinking bout you no doubt about it
I'm laying cross the bed, and you doing it
My maintenance man, put your screw in it (yeah)

Got an ass that a nigga wanna feel on
Pussy lips that you wanna pop the peel off
Two stepping with my rear bottom heels on
Lady in the streets, but a whore in the bed
Tricks with the head, make him spend more bread
Little boys get treated like sex toys
Fuck him in his mouth, yet he run and tell his homeboys
But if the money long he can put the rubber on
Rag city bitch, rag city hoe
I'm a different breed and I do it for the jizz
Masserati, no rims, do it for the scam

Ghetto F-a-b (hey)
This how we do (whoa)

I like my ladies off the glass like shotin off the back board
Sexiest mommies beautiful as black broads
Cutest rude girl, thick as Caucasian
Pretty as conversions, slick as malatians
Ask them let them bitches say yes sir
Young and live among riches in West Jerve
Switch in the excurve
Strut through this bitch in the best furs
Bitch in a Lex Jerse
Twin gray crosses (bling) I'm the might cone
Brightly chrome vendaidoes
Cover your girl face
From the Bruce Lee Roy glow
On a mother a pearl face
All I do is say one word
Yall say it's foolish
I send splurge
I'm a lose 1/3
I never go broke my name got to o's
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S


Nice lips, nice thighs, nice hips
Pussy tighter then a pair of vice grips
I don't pay niggas, niggas pay me
(I'm a hustler baby) like Jay-Z
It's the diamond princess million dollar mistress
From the M-I home of the stop bitches
Christal, and caviar bitches, twist this game for all you fly bitches
I Spit nuttin but the hot shit, you got the four dot get the four dot six
Maybe than you can ride with a hot bitch
VS from the anklet to the wrist
I been in the game just two years
End a few careers there it is
But now I'm back on top again
With some red hot shit for you can cop again (Yeah)",https://genius.com/Trina-how-we-do-feat-fabolous-lyrics

It's so much shit we gotta discuss
When you think about me do you get stuck?
Cause when I think about you everything just
Reminds me of when we had our first Christmas
And I been thinking we should talk about mistrust
Cause it cuts and that hurts
If I could I would play it all backwards
If you say it then you can't take back words
My head pounds my back hurts
When your going no one ever really knows
But when your gone and you feeling really cold
Would that do exactly?
The same thoughts just keep coming at me
You attract me
Would that be I'm not happy


Love is danger
I never thought that I would share it with a stranger
On a mission really thinking I could change up
And if I did was I ready for the change up
Would you listen to what she said and remain calm
But baby you left me filled with my anger
Mistake
Went the wrong way
I'm preparing just to have another long day
Without you I go in
I get mad I throw things
Temper tantrums I want you
We can do it all again and I want to what
Would that do exactly?
The same thoughts just keep coming at me
You attract me would that be
I'm not happy

I built these walls up they been here to protect me
Saying you're all I need now I'm thinking bout you crazy
Cause the last time that I did this
Damn near lost my mind
I can say that I can do this but really can I

But I don't know, I've come too far, I've come too far yeah, too far
Don't know how yeah
A hundred giuseppes never looked so nice on a queen
The ghost pod's reflection, the hairy glisten bling
Standing ovations and the sold out show days
I've been winning since recording a dat tapes
So what a bitch hate, that's what they made for
And I'm the competition I'm what they can't fuck
Prolific, profound and gifted, I don't hear these bitches
Bopping so I don't get tempted
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me
Sterved up, now the chemist cooking chemistry
I can't be duplicated so they all choose to follow me
These birds are pictures of trash, if I... I'm with my pen
Losses ink, that's the day I retire, I never expire
I pray to a God that's higher, he promised me a long time
He give me all I desire

I'm too far, to turn back now
You know I'd reach the peak
But I don't know how
I'm too far, to turn back now
You know I'd reach the peak
But I don't know how
I'm sitting on airplanes/spaceships
I'm an astronaut, with real curf tips
Million dollar whips, I take space trips
I sip starbucks and spend space chips
I play 50 cent moka I'm on vh1
Now tell me something that a bitch done that I ain't done
To not be feeling left out like I am the one
Fucking the world, it's political
I've been hot as the sun
I've been getting to the money like it's nothing
I've been rocking chanel, no... no fuck shit
I'm on my own shit and you hoes no money
I can't take you under cause you thirst for the money
Bitches never had nothing till the game gave it to em
And now they getting money, the... game to them
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

I'm too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don't know how
I'm too far, to turn back now
I reached the peak
But I don't know how
If you was thinking that it was over
Leprechaun, here's my 4 leaf clover
But I don't need luck, I've been prayed up
While they was sleeping, I'm the same bitch who stayed up
While I'm most persistend, why the rockstars love me
Why I'm on my 6th album, why your man wanna fuck me
Why the movie screen calling, why I ain't stop balling
Why you throwing sneak disses if I really ain't the target
Why they throw me on the cover, why my ass so fat
Yeah my ass is a movie, you should see it from the back
And it's hd, high definition
If I never started rapping, all this ass you'd be missing
You'd be in the same position, listening to corny...
All the lies that they telling and the fantasies they wishing
In my own lane and a queen till the death of me
The bitches claim they bad but the only thing bad is me

I reached the peak
But I don't know how

I got that Louie on my luggage, I’m riding number six
Speedin on the highway, diamonds on my wrist
I’m looking for a fly what you know about this
I’m a bad bitch, spotting these hoes I’m a rich bitch",https://genius.com/Trina-rich-bitch-lyrics
Ghetto,Diamonds Are Forever [Mixtape],2011,"Long nails, pack of weave
Dutches and a bag of weed
That's all a bitch like you need
You from the fucking ghetto
That Reggie Miller that you push
Don't be burning like that Cush
You gone need that Reggie bush
Fucking with the ghetto
Moscato filling up my cup
Run outs we don't give a fuck
New folk get me so fucked up
Coming from the ghetto
So watch it when you in tha south
And watch what you say out your mouth
And watch yo step cuz slippers count
When you in the ghetto
Wife beater, nigga Tim's
Slide in with some bigger rims
Flip a key and hit the flee
And go an get some bigger gyms
Tha hood is in the building man
I'll get you in your feelings man
It's some shit outside your house
With rims tha size of ceiling fans
I'm the pride of King Kong
I'm stomping through the Congo
I can make it clap clap, beat it like a bongo
Cat got your tongue
You tell that pussy let you tongue go
Wouldn't of did this shit right here
So gutter but the song so

Ghetto, country, hood, ratchet
Put your hands up if you fucking that shit
Ghetto, ya know opposite of busse
Twelve inch yaki, big round booties
Ghetto
Way to hello, say I'm ghetto
Fly with the medal
Tell em that it is what it is
I make it do what it do
And I love where I live
And my people love it too, cuz we ghetto

You in the Benz in the projects
Lights in yo mama's name
You hustle lock yo celly
And that's the third time yo number changed
Transport airbrush, outside speakers on
Valentino pussy huggers
High heel sneakers on
My feet done, nails too
All on the front porch
You cooking in some Vicki's ass
Hanging out yo boy shorts
Camouflage stiletto's
And diamonds on her metro
Tatted silhouettes, cuz wet is just so fucking ghetto
Dope game, bond man
Bonds money, bonds man
That's how you spend funds man
When you in the ghetto
If you make your money easy
And yo swag is off tha heezy
And yo favorite rapper Jeezy
You are muthafucking ghetto
Hundred dollar jeans on
Price tag bragging
But tha world kiss yo ass
So you where them fucka's sagging
Cd of the newest choice
And Nike's be tha shoe of choice
Candy paint, 24's
Boosters, hoes, and licka stores
(ghetto, so fucking ghetto)


Tomboys, hot boys
Hammer laying in your lap
Got bitches laying in your bed
And robbers laying in your trap
Dubs on the four wheela
TV's in the headrest
And hundred dolla best
Cuz he was tricking give tha head best
Section eight with chase
Eviction notice getting served
Child support, hood homes
Advance on the fucking third
Bootleg DVD's
Rico had anotha kid
Income tax checks
You claiming other people's kids
More hard gold teeth, tattoos dreadlocks
You serving out tha room window
Oh now you call it bedrock
Lace front, long lashes
Looking for a trap star
Now every nigga in the ghetto
He thinkin he a rap star
Fully automatic stick
Out a town a dummy brick
Now watch him role and watch him stick
When you in the ghetto
Pills, dro, kid, blow
And people you don't wanna know
Weed bags, corner stores
It's so muthafuckin ghetto",https://genius.com/Trina-ghetto-lyrics

Put Them Bottles Up,Diamonds Are Forever [Mixtape],2011,"This is show time to party
Put them bottles up, put them bottle up
All I can say is I enjoy the city lights
Put them bottles up, put them bottles up
Can I party and have a nice time
Everything come alive in the  time
Conex for a better life ‘cause I like mine
I laugh although I stay on the top ground

Put them bottles up, put them bottle up
All I can say is I enjoy the city lights
Put them bottles up, put them bottles up
Can I party and have a nice time
Everything come alive in the  time
Conex for a better life ‘cause I like mine
I laugh although I stay on the top ground
I got my mind on my money, money in my hand
I’ve been thinking at dollars 
I stay cash  wondering
What to do if I fall and come again
Playing fast, going hard you can win too
See yourself as a star you begin to
Transform think big and you elevate
Elevating to the top let’s celebrate
Just no ",https://genius.com/Trina-put-them-bottles-up-lyrics

Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around
For most of our lives
It's been you and me
And I always thought
Nothing could come between
Obviously our friendship doesn't mean nothing to you
All this time I though I knew you, oh

Half shirts, mini skirts
All of that ain't gon' work
So stop trying to flirt with my man
Before someone gets hurt
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to be my friend
Joanne, Joanne
Stop trying to freak my man
Joanne, Joanne
How you gon' try to clown
Joanne
I know you got another plan
When I'm not around
We were so close
How could you hurt me
You were my best friend
Where's your honesty
Thought you had my back
But that ain't where you at
See right through you
All this time I thought I knew you
For most of our lives
It's been you and me
And I always thought
Nothing could come between
Obviously our friendship doesn't mean nothing to you
All this time I though I knew you, oh

No way you could fool me
When he loves me truly
I can't believe I once called you a friend
Jo-Jo-Anne

I'm not the bitch to be tried
No remind, I'm makin' 'em cry
Cross the line with my property I'm walkin' up out
Treated you like a sister and you played games
Had to pull out the gangster showing you I'm running things
And I'm naming names
Practically raised you and made you
Classier than most know now I should have caved you
You thought he paged you, SURPRISE!
Heard me on the line
He told me everything about how you wasted his time and
How I cheated when I didn't
If it was given couldn't handle my position
Use your woman's intuition
Pick of the litter
Never compared, never could make me bitter
Compared to you I'll always be the bigger picture
Trying to be Eve, can never have it, act right
Four search parties be looking for you with a flashlight

No, Jo-Jo

Stop trying to be my friend
