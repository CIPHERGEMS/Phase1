Work so hard on her off day, she be still tired
I just wanna take away the pain
I just wanna put you up on game
I just wanna help you make you better, wish you would've never gave it to that lame
Even if we do our own thang, the bond we got can't be explained
Girl, I'm just speakin' for future reference (Oh, oh), 'cause I understand feelings change (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

You're my little secret (Secret)
That's how we should keep it (How we should keep it)
We should never let it go, never let it show
You're my, you're my, oh yeah

I don't care what these hoes think that they got goin' on
I've been here day one, I know what's goin' on
You ain't gotta try to tell me, like I know my place
I never went too far, I always find my way, back to you
Ain't no way I could lose you
Sometimes it's just things in life just worth keepin'
Why we ain't creepin'?

'Cause I had a dream 'bout you
Hope you been thinking 'bout me
'Cause I been thinking 'bout you
Girl, I'm tryna make you my wife
I done told the thots, ""I'm through""
If you ever leave my side, I'ma probably lose my cool
We was in high school and your friends said that it won't work
From the sixth grade to the ninth grade, she did my homework
Put my pistol in your book bag, you ain't even own a purse
You done held me down from the jumpstart, you deserve a verse
You my little secret (You my little secret)
That's how we gon' keep it (That's how we gon' keep it)
Got done gamblin', feelin' like Michael, now I'm finna beat it
'Cause I like a couple pictures on Instagram that don't mean I'm cheatin'
'Cause I'm hangin' out with my dawgs late night that don't mean I'm cheatin'

Oh-oh, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah
You're my little secret
And that's how we should keep it
We should never let it, never let it show
'Cause you know and I know

You're my little secret (Yeah, yeah)
That's how we should keep it (Yeah)
We should never let it go, never let it show (Oh yeah)

When the pack touched down, I was 21
I bought a F&N, hold 21
When I couldn't get a zip, I bought a 21
You ain't jump out in the streets, then you a 21

Young nigga selling rock and robbin', just not to starve
He never paid attention in school, can't get a job
Plus he confused, most of his partners behind bars, he turned to God
Asking Him why he was dealt these cards, he feeling odd
His blood is cold, his heart's scarred but he's a street nigga
He got a pistol, he gon' eat nigga
He give a fuck about a bitch or a weak nigga and that's real
And if that ain't real then tell me what it is
My cousin, 19, they gave his ass 20 years
My nigga Larry died and I'm still shedding tears
But I salute him cause he kept it real
But there's a lot of fakes
Backstabbing ass hoes and snakes
They turn on their people for a little piece of cake
And when you make it to the top, these fuck niggas hate
But I'm okay cause I know one day
That I'ma leave and they gon' know that I was 100

Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets

He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

How many faking they streams? (A lot)

Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

So many hoes, had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro

I hit your bitch, she a jump off
Cartier bracelets for her, they don't come off
They get the swag from Atlanta and run off
I make the boys swing the stick like a tomahawk
Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out

Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead end, me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the 6 doin' donuts (Skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor
Drive fast, ain't no pullin' me over

No alcohol, go get me a new soda

Move the crack behind the toaster
Carry pistols with no holsters
Trying not to be a poster
You was listening to your coaches
I was listening to the vultures
And I slept with rats and roaches
That's why I don't smoke no roaches
Niggas tryna knock my focus
Wonder why I'm sippin' potion
We happy, dog but we ain't joking
Big bullets, we ain't poking

Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Niggas quick to say they loyal to you, they be see-through
Gang, gang, screaming ""fuck you,"" they want to eat you

Fuck the chatter, he gon' tattle, put 'em on the platter
Snakes plotting on my downfall I can hear 'em rattle

Is you a friend or a foe? Is you gonna cut a nigga throat?
Ain't no more going back broke, ain't no more sharing no clothes
Ain't no more selling dope, 12 can't arrest me no more

Compton Red's in the cut tryna hit the dope, nigga where the cut in
Tied his partna up in the cut

That nigga had bussed so the nigga got popped
Me and Johny tried to rob everything

Chevy went down the road nigga twice
They tried to give my nigga Teetay life

I just bought a Range Rover, this shit ain't 'bout the fame homie
Mookie told me I deserve it, momma told me I deserve it
I know if Tayman was alive, he would tell me I deserved it

Heart So Cold,The Slaughter Tape,2015,"So cold
My heart so cold

My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit

My heart so cold, I’m sticking to the code
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don’t fold
I’m tricking J’s daily, selling sheetrock for blow
In my younger days nigga I was robbing stores
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom seem like you ain’t got hope
And when you got kids nigga anything will go
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Can’t digest these percocets, they got my chest fucked up
Pussy niggas shot me six times, my luck fucked up
Hundred band lick pussy nigga, now I’m fucked up

My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit

Fast paper had me dropping out of school
Violating laws, breaking all the rules
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging ‘round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas’ partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts
And just because we paid, the stress don’t decay
Still thinking ‘bout them losses, winning never made ‘em fade
With Gs being dead and  on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can’t do the shit I didn’t do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin’ me ‘cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok, no
Man just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok

My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit

I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets

I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing a bet from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan

Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it

Pull up nigga, send some shots at your boo
