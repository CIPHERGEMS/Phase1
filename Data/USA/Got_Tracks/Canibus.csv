Greatest Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I think fast, switch fast, quick fast, quick as
Immigrants say, ""No habla ingles"", at border-patrol fences
Messin' with Canibus is senseless
Divide my senses by six and you'll end up with triple sixes
And triple the digits mean triple the spirits
My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics
I'm triple the threat, I'm triple my physical flesh
I'm telling you, put your money on me, then triple your bet
‘Cause I won't be satisfied 'til I'm set
'Til I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect
Rhyming is the nine-to-five that I manipulate best
Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript
Called ""The Biography of Canibus,"" subtitled ""The Ultimate Guide for Teaching Modern Man How to Spit""
How to tongue-twist, how to enunciate certain shit
How to control your breath, how to make your syllables spit
Y'all niggas ain't listen to Bis, I kill ‘em with shit
I'm wicked with this, I should be selling tickets to this
Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this
My fans in the street with signs tryin' to picket for this
Saying, ""We want ‘Bis! We want ‘Bis!
We want the rapper with the illest lyrics!""
My dedication and my commitment's beginning-less
I can go four quarters or nine innings for this
Go twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this
Lead crusades across Europe, like the Christians for this
The notion I'm dedicated is an understatement
My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station
Sneak-attack rappers, grab 'em and slash 'em
Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors
Hunt 'em, like Jurassic Park actors
But spare Samuel Jackson's life
‘Cause he was the only black one
Action-packed like Shaft, the black assassin
Blastin' the .753 backwards Magnum
Follow me down 
the road to Damascus
Do not follow these madmen, poppin' ecstasy pills like aspirin
I and I come fe manifest the most high
Drink a gallon of cyanide and still cannot die
Niggas want to lock the ‘Chronicles of Canibus' away forever
And put my book of rhymes through a shredder
Never, I'm way too clever the way I manoeuvre
Beat your ass, like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua
In front of a hundred-million pay-per-viewers
Your career is ruined
Your face will be swollen, like the Benihana Buddha
Bring it to ya, prove you're a loser
Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future
Pounce upon you, like a puma or some wild cougars
In the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through 'em
I'ma reprogram everything that you're doin'
Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booin'
You're stupid, you and your whole crew are extremely foolish
I can't cipher with you, ‘cause your breath is too putrid
Put your mic down and step away from it!
Shut your motherfucking mouth and don't say nothin'!
You have the right to remain silent
Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestylin'

I heard a rumor English women make love the best
Is that true?
 ‘Cause I ain't had no justice yet
A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is
Bite the style but can't digest it
'Til they get karate-kicked in the mouth
And their teeth get ejected
Told you to watch who you beef with on the last record
Platinum teeth? I sell them for a thousand pounds a piece
You buy one back and you get one free
Put it down in the East, put it down in the West
Put it down on paper, put the paper down on the desk
In the studio is where I put it down to the test
It's nothing but skull-crushing pressure down at them depths
Throw a rough mix down, download it to disk
Give a copy to everybody that's down with Bis
Since '96, the Dogg Pound Remix
First time anybody put me down to spit
It's like 
Pac Man
, don't stop, 'til I hear my voice
Banging up and down the block in a Magnavox
With a hundred watts
Creating ripples in the water, like aquanauts
Breathing through their oxygen-box
I belong on top of the pops, not on the bottom with rocks
I mean, honest to God, I'm shocked
I thought the album was hot
I guess you can't write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind
That's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind
A lot of rappers are ahead of their time
But when it comes to rhymes like mine
The word ""time"" doesn't apply
You see, rhyming is the art
The microphone is the paintbrush
Responsible for getting the point across
The canvas is the street, where the Master of the Ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see
Nobody could rhyme this fluent
Nobody ever did what I'm doin'
Nobody ever spit what I'm spewin'
I'm the illest alive and I'ma prove it, plus I've got to show the people that I've got mad love for Rap music
I bury MC's with rosary beads
A picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me
I'm as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt
Put some instrumentals on
And ask my pen to dance; I'm such a gentleman
Pull out chairs, open doors, never offend my fans
Unless they offend me and I lose my temper, man",https://genius.com/Canibus-greatest-freestyle-lyrics
Second Round K.O.,Can-I-Bus,1998,"Yo, Canibus, man, what's up, man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man, you were booming
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggas, you know I mean?
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard, man, I wasn't with that
But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though, right?
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game, man, they've been playing me all my life, man
You know 
I won the title a couple of times
Did right, you know what I mean?
But they can't hurt us, man, we gonna do it
Get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself, man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you, man, 
get up in there, move that head, man
Come on to me, man, 
but when you come, man
You gotta come for blood, man
Come up to me, man, come on, bust that nigga whole
Man, niggas talking that shit about you
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right?
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself, man

Yo, I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, something that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only dropping clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showing off your body ‘cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me ‘cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From 
Ice-T
 to 
Kool Moe Dee
 to 
Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me? You must be crazy
You dripping with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

Yo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out or don't come out at all

You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
‘Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul, rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feeling himself ‘cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, let me tell you something, you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, 
call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say ""Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is""
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself, trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?
 Fuck that!
‘Cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds, Can-i-bus

Yo, Canibus man, you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man, you in-and-out, and you're agile with your flow, man
But dig right, you got to eat, man
That's your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas, man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you, but dig right
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's
For lunch, breakfast, dinner; that's your agenda, baby
Your agenda to consume them
Their whole existence, they can't exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever, Mike Tyson, on the def",https://genius.com/Canibus-second-round-ko-lyrics
Poet Laureate II,Rip the Jacker,2003,"[
Intro: James Dickey sample
]
Uh, I don’t understand how a writer would ever get writer’s block, so-called. My problem is having too much and being unable to get it down

Yo, why is the Ripper so ill?
That would be an unpardonable breach of confidence for me to reveal
He said, ""
One of these days, all eyes would be on me
When they look up in the sky and see the neon C""
Rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased
In glass with an ion beam for longevity
For more than ten centuries, impressions and memories
The first time-machine inventor will mention me
Canibus was a visionary indeed
He believed light could travel in multiples of c
The organic supercomputer that solved the mysteries of
Klein Kaluza with two blue metric rulers
Liked Cool J, but thought Stephen Jay Gould was cooler
And he never liked to propagate rumors
Smoked Canary Island cigars
Liked American luxury cars and beautiful Asian broads
He had a strong mind, he used to philosophize
About rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai
He claimed that he had written 
the greatest rhyme of all time
But he would never take it out his archives
He wrote two songs per day
And was constantly experimenting with his wordplay
In his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
He got an F but he deserved an A
I followed his career from the first day
It seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways
I seen him pull in twenty-four hour workdays
With deferred pay, undeterred by the word ""shame""
Public humiliation was the worst pain
He was spinning out of control like a Class 5 hurricane
He said he wouldn't want another MC to suffer the same
Especially when there's nothing to gain
He was the illest alive but nobody would face it
He spit till his tongue was too torched to taste it
Privately funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations
To extract the information
They found it utterly amazing
They claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting
Never mattered to him that art galleries hated him
'Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take ten
Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language
With sound but without shape or signature
Kept files in his garage on MS-DOS
In a fire-proof pod, we thought it was odd
Outside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock
He apparently kept more wax than Madame Tussaud's
We were in total awe 'cause it blew our minds
So many rhymes that were intricately designed
He was Poet Laureate of his time
And if you don't mind, I'd like to share some of his rhymes
Alone in my room looking through the 32X telescope zoom
Adjusting the focus of the moon
One should not assume the philosophy of David Hume
Is nothing more then a subjective conclusion
What is the maximum field rate application?
The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin
Affects the population fluctuation
On a continuous basis but that's just the basics
The juxtaposition of Canibus' position
The precision of something no other has written
Way above and beyond what was intended
The unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence
You didn't go to college obviously
I can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology
A remarkable odyssey, the rhymes of modern speeds
When the brain orders the body not to breathe
Your competency is not up to speed, you're not in my league
You couldn't possibly be hotter then me
Or oppositely your minus twenty-five degrees
You'd squeeze but the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze
Allow me to speak figuratively, nigga please
My intellectual properties are about the size of Greece
Your counselor advised you not to speak
My counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat
In the words of Joseph Heller, ""I learned how to write better
Even though it sort of irked me""
He said he didn't understand the process of the imagination
But he felt he was at its mercy
Which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces
The reason why nobody's probably ever heard of me
Couldn't understand what I mean by ill
Unless you try to translate what I print to film
This is the line, the reel, the circle of time
The cycle of eternity, the emergence of one line
Academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied
And personifies dry humor of cum laude alumni
A wise man sees failure as progress
A fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic
And loses his soul in the process
Obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content
My style is masterful, multilateral
I could battle a fool and be naturally cruel
Words of scorn are a disastrous tool
From an existentialist's view I'm a better rapper than you
Grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in two
My attitude is fucked up but admirable
Different methods interpreted into different forms
From entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms
Not just spitting a poem, there’s much more involved
There's much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve
Forty-eight orders of mechanical laws
And rays of creational cause enhance the cadence of my bars
Maybe I am self-absorbed
But that's the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R
Today is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was
Permitting you heard of Beelzebub
A tale of demons and drugs, pissy drunk in the club
With the DJ doing the needle rub
Chances are you'll never see me son
Yeah I know my name's Canibus but I can't help you if you need a dub
I came to holla at some big booty bitches and listen to the speakers thump
Where you get conceited from?
I'm so nice on the mic they wanna beat me up
It's deep as fuck, I ain't seen it all but I've seen enough
Really unbelievable stuff
There's a lot of times when I want to speak but I'm stuck
I should leave this rap shit alone
And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home
My imagination is my own
The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone
With a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the Enneagram
And become ""Can-I Millenium Man""
Engrave my back with the emperor's stamp
Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began
Trying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam
And the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang
Every warrior has an axe to bury
But he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary
I said to myself, ""Germaine, this is insane
It's suicide, it's controlled flight into terrain""
I fought to regain control of the plane, but went up in a ball of flames
And got banned from the Hip-Hop hall of fame
For two bars I kept hearing in my head
Over and over again, it cost me everything
I'm convinced now that more than the truth is at stake
Where people create language that pretends to communicate
Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes
But its a byproduct of the ghetto music we make
From an extroverted point of view I think its too late
Hip Hop has never been the same since '88
Since it became a lucrative profession
There's a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression
Even though the potency of it lessens
Big money industries writing checks to suppress the question
And nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store
Ever since the confluence of Moore's Law
But I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr
 
and his son Aage
Edward Lorenz
 
and Leo Szilard
Lyrically I took rap music and turned the knob
To the right full throttle and added panache
Why would I argue with my own conscience over the truth?
That's like me telling myself, ""Don't tell me what to do""
Dialyses and analyses of battle MCs
Sometimes I say things I myself can't believe
My lyrical is so skillfully elliptical
I can understand how it makes you miserable
You wonder why I never let you play your beats for me
Or why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy
You wonder what's my infatuation with Alicia Keys
""Canibus why don't you speak to me?""
Yo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me
That's why I said it so vehemently
You need to replace the hate with respect
I'm probably the best yet, Poet Laureate

Generally I take… I go with the given, you know, with what comes ta me over, the celestial wireless… Whenever it comes. You’re lucky when you get it",https://genius.com/Canibus-poet-laureate-ii-lyrics
100 Bars,2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000,"Yeah! That's the beat right there
I'm about to black out with a hundred bars on some professional shit, so don't try this at home, yo
Yo, yo, yo

My style of rhymin' is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans
Because I recognize it's all about timing
Me and my freestyle alliance practicin' African voodoo science
In front of twenty feet bonfires lookin' skyward calculating May 5, 2000
The nine planets'll be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet in the cockpit
Of a starship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet
With mercury ion rockets
And a big-ass ""Canibus Comin' Soon"" poster on the side of it
I'm known geographically and intergalactically
That's why I got extraterrestrials that wanna battle me
They even tried kidnappin' me and they would've snatched me
If their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity
Engines stalled and failed, crashed into a farmer's field
And that's really what caused Roswell
Undercover operatives workin' for COM 12
Disguised as a nigga, signed with a record deal
Lyrically I'm off-scale
So all hail or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y'all feel
Briusin' niggas, confusin' niggas like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens
Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles
Hear the wild wolf growl
Styles stockpiled for miles from the ground to the clouds
Wack niggas wanna be down but it's not allowed
Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth
With the southpaw southern fist
I'll bust your shit, swell your lip bigger than Bubba's shrimp
For acting tough and shit, what a wimp
You giant Goliath, niggas get shot with a rubber sling
I'm an experiment gone bad
My brainwaves on an encephalograph show that I'm stark ravin' mad
Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast
When I throw the Florence flask in my hand
Flammable liquids in the lab explode
And you get stabbed with all the flyin' glass
Trained to blow up commercial aircraft, 
 
trained in chemical weapons class
Just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last
I put him in a leather mask,  spray his ass with a can of pepper gas
Then watch him grab his neck and gag
Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh
""You wanna battle?"" is the type of question you should never ask
Nigga, pick a tougher task, see who the fuck'll last
Whoever lose'll get a solderin' iron up the ass
You need to recognize
My hand is quicker than the eye,
 
quicker than the five speed Jamiroquai drives
A lifespan longer than nine lives, infinite rhymes that can't die
A nigga with a divine mind
I dedicate this to the wise, dedicate it to dimes
Dividin' myself into hundred ten times
You can't deny the offerin's I offer
Flows that glow with auroras that sparkle like water
Fly like a saucer 
with the torque of a Porsche
Murder a million MC's, then autograph all of their coffins
Been gettin' it on since I been born and I'm a live long
And I'm a be gettin' it on 'till I'm gone
Look at all the stages I been on, all the songs that I spit on
I took an oath to rip everything I get on
A nigga like me should have Carpal Tunnel syndrome
In the wrist bones from gripping microphones this long
I'm just a small fish in a big pond
And gets pissed off, whenever I get picked on
Nigga try to flip and get flipped on
My army march a million strong,
 
like the Nation of Islam with suede Timbs on
Extremely hostile
Fully armed troops dressed in frog suits and night vision goggles
A lyrical lynch mob
Shittin' on niggas drawn to a hideous form with horns and a mink on
Duckin' down low like we in 'Nam fightin' the Viet Cong
Screamin' ""Incoming!"" when I see a bomb
Speak to your leader, surrender your arms
You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds
Plus 800,000 to even consider a war
And 200,000 more to even look hard
You better drop your flag and withdraw
My cavalry charge accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors
And smash y'all, attach y'all to the back of my horse
And drag y'all across the motherfuckin' asphalt
Nine out of ten niggas is frauds
You know who you are, always talkin' about your bitches and your cars
Your jewelry and your girls, it's like we from two different worlds
You motherfuckers really get on my nerves
'Cause I'm beyond them, on some futuristic cyborg shit
I close my eyes when I freestyle, so I could read what prints across them
Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience
To barbecue your brain organs
You feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven
I flame broil suckers then hit 'em with some more shit, the raw shit
Call my reinforcements, the Four Horsemen
Take a big piece of chalk and draw a line across the stage pulpit
I dare a motherfucker to cross it
I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the mornin'
Tell him it's important, tell him to call Sting three way and sing a chorus
Break your camcorders, so you motherfuckers can't record it
Call the news, I'll kill your reporters
Start a lawsuit, I'll kill your lawyers
Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y'all think
My album's gold cause my album was the bomb shit
Y'all niggas got your ass beat, 'cause you asked for it
Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid
'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys
You fuck 'em in the ass, then you give 'em cash for it
That's some sick shit homeboy
A hundred years ago they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud
You fraudulent, feminine, fragile as a feather is
With an effortless blow, I'll crack your whole skeleton
You think you're better than Canibus, where's the evidence?
You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship
You need to shut the fuck up, cause your breath stink
Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints
Battlin' me, you never win
You thought you was the only nigga, that could sneak a weapon in?
 Nigga, guess again
Cause after I'm finished wreckin' this shit
I'm a drink a whole bottle of Henny and go fuck a lesbian",https://genius.com/Canibus-100-bars-lyrics

War Lab, call us haters all you want

Fuck it, call me a hater, full blown instigator
Leavin niggas on intubators breathin like Darth Vader
I hate people that pack guns but they don't bust 'em
Or bitches that come back to my room but they ain't fuckin
Pistol clutching, the Dozen, you heard it don't get is misconstrued

If you’re an MC and you mention my name in the wrong way, you draw first blood, I’m gonna come at you""

You pushed D12 to the side to sign Voltron 5
If Proof was alive, he'd be dyin' inside
You ain't no hip-hop messiah, you a bitch 'cause you dissed Mariah
Shit like that supposed to be private
I'ma fry you on behalf on Mariah and Michael
Put you back on them drugs, make you suicidal
You can't shut the record down, nigga it's viral
When you use the word ""nigga,"" just remember your idols

I got a question, I'm white, can I join D12?
I'll sell you four million records then I'll tell you go to hell
Leave Swifty in charge, then remove all the stars
And make the group wish Bizarre shot pool in a bar
An assault lawyer stop the beat, suing us all
I really do hope you know who get involved
Cause I'm a fan and I'll get you for a Nick Cannon dissin'
And you already know how fuckin' sick Canibus is

I hate a bitch-ass nigga just as much as I hate fags
I love goin' to war but I hate when they raise the flag
These niggas hittin' the streets spittin' venom on me
Then start renegin' the beef, I hate peace treaties
Forever yo' enemy I increase beef as Amityville's finest
Cause I don't believe in stoppin' violence
I'm a tyrant that'll snatch my respect and scram
I use a Uzi cause I hate a Tec when it jams
I hate when dudes treat this like life a movie
Usin' rap as his excuse to do shit and they only move keys in the booth
I piss on niggas hands, whoever's grown, patches and tombstones
I hate 'em ass when I break into a home
I'm barefaced, I clap your cat, ransack it
That's what I'm wearin' black and I hate goin' out the back
So call me a hater, walkin' detonator, I ain't afraid
To stick this blade into your fade in front of spectators

You're an emcee, big small it doesn't matter
No matter how big I get, I just want people to know

You the devil in a red dress on MTV
You signed more black people than a basketball team
What you trying to say subconsciously?
 You can't rock the beat like me
Consciously, you know I rock you to sleep
Slim Shady you a coward 'cause you scared to rap with me
The only black man you respect is 50
And the greatest rapper of all time was dead right and dead wrong
You shouldn't have even been on that song

He fell off so hard this faggot broke his accent
I'm flippin through the channels seein Bruno get his ass sniffed
And I'm disgusted man, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Why'd you date Mariah? Mariah's not a fuckin' dude
You never even saw her nude and you busted, too
Must have been thinkin 'bout your stepdad touchin' you
But that ain't nothin new
, 
I asked your ugly crew
They verified it,
 so bitch quit lyin'

I remember the first time we met, I ain't even liked you
Walkin' around my video set like you was in high school
It must excite you seeing black people being tribal
That's why Dr. Dre signed you
I bet you right now you got a big rotten 
Rosenberg
 beside you
Trying to be just like your father, inside you
Your 
Stan
 android fanboys need to kill that noise
I know what you thinking, ""kill that boy""

We leavin' Elvis funny money makin' pelvis shattered
Let's see you 
square dance
 now, let's see you hold your bladder
Let's see you fire back Em where's the fire at it?
Suicide hotline time, go dial that
Put on that ""8 Mile"" hat and write a vile track
Get at some people that can actually diss you back
No more target practice on retarded actors
And pop stars, Marshall you're not hard

""Whatever happens to me in this game, I've always got my ear to the street""

Y'all a bunch of JJ Fags,
 now who the fuck is bad?
Motherfucker I'm bad!
Call me a hater

""I'm kinda doing this deliberately 'cause I wanted a reaction from him""
""Oh you want us to get him on, you two can go at it""
""Well, that would probably take up the whole hour and we don't have a lot of time so you can do that""

Master Thesis,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness
Come to micclub.net where you can read this
Run a plot on the map in hyperspatia
From the Society for Scientific Exploration
Color is vibration, vibration is sound
Sound resonates through the mouth, check it out
What I say vibrates no less than 9 ways
South, South East, West, South West, East
North, North East, North West
And the black and white images fade to grey sound waves
Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze
With a bewildering array of lyrical display
The Best of Bis orbitally rearranged
Monoatomic elements with adept intelligence
The highest professorship, my English etiquette
Compels me to not say it if I can't spell it bitch
My circularized third eye sees all
Atlantis was surrounded by 4 sea walls
I read one-fourth of the Library of Alexandria
Before it was burnt to the floor
I wish I could've learned more
About the shapes of the sacred geometry they used to draw
They were new millennium but Euclidean in form
Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old
Carved from Egyptian gold, moulded in Assyria
With processed Beryllium by the quintillion
They cooked on symmetrical stoves
With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal
And they barbecued birds to the bone
And thhey burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome
I talked to Mr. Fuller over the phone
And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome
Said he didn't want to do it alone
I told him I was busy writing poems but I'll think about going
The process was slow and the dough was low
But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow
Plus I ain't never travelled that far from home
But I heard about the beauty of Cydonian snow
Neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass
I'll be crazy to pass
I like Algerian Jazz
The blue twilight band that plays, tunes from a laser black sax
It sounds so laid back, it helps me relax
I brought the album after seeing K-Pax
Oh how I miss my nautilus
I was told pharyngoamygdalitis did not exist
You have a modest case of scaphocephalous
I prescribe some neo-gothic antibiotics
Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith
Deadly as 10 droplets of Ricin toxin
From every angle the competition gets boxed in
As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine
Translate the English alphabet to the omega text
Life is now and death is next
Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell
Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale
These dark side tales might affect sales
I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales
Use the aphrodisiac to get a female
Called Ginger, tie her up and drink her ginger ale
Grand Marnier for me, scotch on the rocks for you
Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's
In the studio with James Lipton
Reminiscing about the script that was written before the beginning
All of a sudden the boos turned into applause
My jaw's stronger than the Caninde Macaw's
Can't even count the bars I've expended so far
Don't want to rap no more, it's been so long
I wish the clock would hurry up and tick
I'm out in the bush and the sticks humping a 100 clicks
Dr Scholls gave me a good fit
Me and him went to school together back in '86
When I was really ill
Putting Planck energy in a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill
You wanna laugh now and cast your belligerent doubt
Show you what poetry is really about
The side effects will make you pass out
Followed by skin rash, itching, diarrhoea, nausea and dry mouth
You want a time out? You better spit a rhyme out
Before the community of real MCs die out
College students say to me, ""You ain't smart""
Record label A&Rs say, ""This ain't art""
These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark
Listen to my chest beat, tell me this ain't heart
You gotta be as obsequious as the Disciples of Jesus
This is my Master Thesis",https://genius.com/Canibus-master-thesis-lyrics
Channel Zero,Can-I-Bus,1998,"Approximately fifty years ago, under the direction of President Harry Truman, and in the interest of national security, a group of twelve top military scientific personnel were established. This group's primary objective was to desensitize us to the truth, and to suppress the material evidence that our planet is being visited by a group of extraterrestrial biological entities called The Grays

Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero

Yo, sometimes the road to the truth is so elusive, it's confusin'
And reality becomes illusion
If I showed the masses where we was at or where we was goin'
I'd shatter the social balance of the world as we know it
I'm talkin' 'bout the grand deception of 1947
When our souls were sold to the heavens
For technologically advanced weapons
Crystal enhanced, brain implants, and mind control methods
MJ-12 is not majestic
And the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic
You can accept it, or be stupid and be a skeptic
And fail to recognize the secret society's death wish
Ninety-seven percent of our Presidents were Masons
Responsible for launderin' trillions of dollars from the nation
For the construction of underground military installations
Abductions and cattle mutilations
Experiments on human patients
Can take place in several subterranean bases
A hundred and fifty storeys below a basement
With knowledge of genetic information, you need to fear science not Satan
'Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents
They create strange creations
Top secret special operations
Low frequency sounds and lasers, people like Carl Sagan
That didn't believe in the Drake equation
Were tryin' to keep Western civilization on the need-to-know basis
Well, you need to know that this is a game
And we're bein' betrayed and played in the worst way

Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero

Yo, the Holy Script from Genesis 1:26 says
""Let us make man in our image under our likeness""
First of all who's ""they?""
You see if God was truly a single entity, that's not what He would say
We as the Elohim, Gods and Goddesses
Possess a marvelously monstrous subconscious
Lifeforms that speak, in very high pitched sounds and squeaks
Short staccato clicks and beeps
A highly advanced form of speech
Even though to us, it seems like they only chatterin' they teeth
They used to swim deep in the oceans beneath
'Til they fins transformed into limbs and they started to creep
Then they evolved into mammals with feet
And walked right from the shorelines onto the beach
They used gravity, 'cause it's actually the only force around
That could slow time and the speed of light down
The energy grid network opened the gateway from Earth
To any point in the universe
Livin organisms and various geomagnetic gravitational anomaly areas
Space expedition teams in the lunar regions
Reported seein', decapyramids and tetrahedrons
Liquid filled shoes, is what they used
To walk across the moon without leavin' a clue
Of where they been for the past twenty-three billion years
Before life on the surface even appeared
I hope you become aware what I'm spittin' in your ear
Was intended to stimulate your left brain's hemisphere
I know it sounds weird, all these motherfuckin' answers
And questions to the grand deception

Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero
Tune in to channel zero, tune in to channel zero

Buckingham Palace,Can-I-Bus,1998,"Ayo, I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace sellin' reefer
Puffing the chalice with the Beefeaters
Getting so high that whenever I drop shit
It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit
Canibus with the hot shit, crazy eye clique
Niggas is bloody idiots thinkin' they can stop this
I'll increase my strength to a superhuman extent
Nigga, your rhyme ain't worth sixpence
And if you can hear, smell, see, touch and taste
Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face
From Brixton to 
Clapham Common
My lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin and murder niggas for rhyming
Spittin' fire with gasoline for saliva
As drunk as Lady Diana's driver with reporters behind her
Alcohol in the hands of a minor
I got you panickin' like bombs with thirty second timers
Clear the building, evacuate women and children
Fuck what you feelin', nigga, I came here to kill 'em
Straight shitting from New York to Great Britain
And when we do shows we make the Queen pay admission
What?

When I say, ""Can-I,"" you say, ""Bus""
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, when I say, ""Can-I,"" you say, ""Bus""
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, yo, yo

Prepare for the worst, this next verse is the face of death
Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex
Illmatic, my lyrical skills are Jurassic
With more flavor than Skittles when I'm digitally mastered
I go off like a cannon and blow up the planet 
with no fear
Like them clothes white boys be wearin'
I'm tougher than denim
, 
lethal like venomous snake bites
The marijuana makes my eyes bright red like brake lights
There ain't a party I couldn't rock, believe that
There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback
I'm strong, my word is Bond like James
Niggas be tryin' to test but they 
weak like seven days
MC's run away when I kick it
They act so chicken, they should come with a large drink and a biscuit
My style's radioactive, massive, atomic
I plan to push the Earth in front of Halley's Comet
Breaking the facts of life down like Tootie
, 
I'm raw like sushi
With more vocab than three fucking Fugees
So recognize or be hospitalized
'Cause lyrically on a scale of one to ten I'm twenty-five

When I say, ""Can-I,"" you say, ""Bus""
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, when I say, ""Can-I,"" you say, ""Bus""
Can-I (Bus!), Can-I, (Bus!)
Yo, yo

A little bit of weed and some Hennessy
Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy
See, I need much more energy then my enemies
If I wanna make more bills than Bellamy
So I could be on MTV
With women constantly telling me I resemble Billy Dee
I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene
Then when I'm on the scene, I do shows to get the green
Then I take the green, buy a automobile machine
For that thing on page forty-three in Jet Magazine
Canibus is the ultimate executioner's dream
Swinging the guillotine
Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon
The brain remains conscious for ten seconds
Long enough for me to give you one last message
And when you get to Hell, you can tell Lucifer I said it
Don't ever get it confused
Fuckin' with Canibus the human Rubik's Cube like you got something to prove
Yo, whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew
From Moet bottles, to bar stools, fruits, and foods
You got a album out? You get hit with your CD, too
Runnin' outside cryin', lyin', denyin'
That you ain't The Gay Rapper but you got fucked by him
What's the difference? Y'all niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness
Too busy mixin' your bidness with your bitches
While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures
So wicked, I got Satan ejaculating on his fingers
Like Dirk Diggler in the middle of Boogie Nights
Sniffin' white, living the hype, he ruined his life
But I'm a MC of a different type, yeah, that's right
Make sure your shit is tight or I'ma snatch your mic, nigga

When I say, ""Can-I,"" you say, ""Bus""

Punch Lines,Hip-Hop for $ale,2005,"Canibus, Hamza!
Follow us into a new era
Where lyrical content is a MUST!

We cut microphones like, gangsters holdin chrome
Like, Toto you far from home
Like, words spoken wrong will never help you reach excellence
Stop bitin like you got a speech impediment
When will you learn?
Whack lyrics and a hot beat makes your song irrelevant
This is not a movie
I'm a poet so it takes more than punchlines to move me

Can-I-Bus, your favorite rap star on ice
What I talk on the mic make them call on Christ
As far as the eye can see, gaze out into the wide sea
Look for the island, the island is me
I heard Fat Joe said, I was over in Iraq
He said I was a soldier in lyrical combat
Other people slandered my name but I dodged that
They don't see the missing pieces my thesis provides rap
Under the influence, bang 'Bis music in a Bonneville Buick
I see your face, I'mma crash into it
Lyrically I kick ass, if you don't wanna know don't ask
I might do it pro bono for no cash
The two-handed choke from the hope
Turn your brain and skull to sand and salt, sprinkle you on the floor
I didn't wanna rap like that, but I had to
Cause that's what my master would do if he was asked to
The perfect music machine, mechanical being
The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen
I did, I do, I does, I am, I will be, I was
The same nigga you love


Yo, I hope they film this shit, cause I'm 'bout to blaze you
And get it on tape too, I'm 'bout to Kay Slay you
Somebody gon' grab you - try to escape
Hold you down while I perform {?} on your face
Why you sound like that, why you tear the mic down like that
Why you sound so intense when you rap
The airborne attack you can't call off
Breathe exhaust like a horse or a supercharged Mustang Ford
Drugs rain from the sky, it's like the angels want me to die
They push me harder cause they want me to try
A pitbull off the leash, barkin speech
Like a bull in the pit, liftin you off your feet
I feel like the world's mine, I can park in the streets
Kick the world's illest rhyme, police officers weak
People layin on the concrete, exhausted from heat
Watchin John Kerry spit over Michael Moore beats
This is a little somethin that my repertoire boast
I almost, was in control of all coasts...


I get advanced rhymes to quote, they all dope
Tote a lyrical landslide, give me all votes
But I can be as quiet as they want me to be
Cause even though they say my name, they ain't talkin to me
They talk to magazines, they talk to MTV
They up on 106 on BET talkin to Free
Big niggas actin tough, but they walk like they ankles is cuffed
Who gives a FUCK if your ankles is buff
I can ar-ticulate, I wanna participate
But they tryin to hold me back, a black ball number eight
I pick the microphone up and spark the debate
Ever since ninety-eight I been a target for hate
Jesus Christ! My name should be He-Bus Mic
Even when I rip the shit, fans leave uptight
But I don't know if I'm right no more
But I don't know if I'm right no more

U Didn’t Care,C! True Hollywood Stories,2001,"You didn't care about me
And now this is how it has to be
I was lost, but now I am free
I'm happy 'cause I found a family

Whattup Em? It's ya biggest fan
It's not even necessary to introduce who I am by now, 'cause we're good friends
Remember the letter I wrote, before Atlanta on Up In Smoke
That's the day I was gonna cut ya throat
I guess my watch was broke -- ' cause by the time I woke
I seen my watch was twelve hours late and I missed the show
But nonetheless I'm glad that I finally reached you
Ever since the accident I've been dying to speak to you
To tell you things have changed, and I'm a different man
A different level of understanding, I'm a different Stan
Things are a lot better, I promise I won't harass you with any letters
Saying shit like ""We should be together""
I meant we should start a group
The industry's full of homosexuals Slim, but I don't wanna fuck you
I got a new attitude, really, I ain't mad at you
I just wanted you to recognize I got talent too


When I say talented, I don't mean battle kid
I mean storytelling, kinda like how ya album is
I been attending counseling and taking medicine
They did some tests on me at NIH in Maryland
They showed me techniques to help me deal with pressure
Whenever I remember that crazy night when I was being reckless
Driving with a deathwish, on the bridge and I crashed into a Lexus
Right before I finished that last sentence
I was listenin to Xzibit's album ""Restless""
The next thing I knew I was under water and breathless
I was unconscious for a second, literally dying to go to heaven
Till some fellas came and pulled me from the wreckage
They started CPR, then they called the paramedics
In retrospect I probably shoulda used a gun to end it
By the time the car sunk
My pregnant girlfriend was still in the trunk
And I was still feelin kinda drunk
The ambulance came and they put me on the stretcher
Hooked me up to the IV and checked my blood pressure
One of them was so concerned that they wouldn't leave
He hopped in the back of the ambulance and rolled up some weed
My vision was blurry, I couldn't really see
I just remember his voice talking to me
In the emergency room, I needed surgery to get some glass removed
And fifty stitches for my wounds


After a couple months of therapy
I figured I was as ready as I'd ever be - I wanted to be an emcee
He took me to shows wit him, he let me flow wit him
He let me write some rhymes and go on tour wit him
I really believed in him, I decided to team wit him
And now I'm overseas wit him, getting cheese wit him
And I'm emceeing wit him, I'm having the best time of my life
And I'm writing the best rhymes of my life
He introduces me to people as his lyrical equal
Let me write a rhyme on his album and even produce a beat too
He ain't see-through, I can't see him fronting
He's not the type to call you, just because he needs something
That's what I like about him
I wouldn't want to rock a mike without him
He's got kahunas and he's not a coward
Matta fact, I think he met you
It was the day you came to his video shoot with DJ, Jimmy's nephew
'Clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you
That you was ghost writing for L, but that wasn't true
You was looking at him the same way I'm looking at you
Why can't we be friends Em', I don't want nothing from you
You see there's a little bit of Stan in all of us
Tell me where you think all of these record sales spawn from
Talking 'bout Britney and Christina Aguilera
Nsync too, have you ever looked in a mirror?
Your hair ain't really blonde, and ya eyes ain't blue
So never diss me, cuz when you diss me you're dissin' you
So, see what happens when you don't care",https://genius.com/Canibus-u-didnt-care-lyrics
Curriculum 101,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"Claims are being made that for me go far beyond the available evidence and in fact in many cases are contradicted by the evidence and that bothers me

Forensic psychologist Samuel Dubios explains
""You'll probably never understand Germaine""
Incoherent speeches, puzzles in pieces
The sub-chemical deepness of his glandular excretions
Realms of Heaven and Hell
Glowing angelic gel spliced with bovine leukaemia cells
Demons in Hell they call to me, I scream, ""What can you offer me?""
They reply, ""Techno-Sorcery""
They tell me the meek will never inherit the world
'Cause they're weak standing on two 12 inch feet
I dream quasi-Draconian dreams when I sleep
Peyote leaves mixed with the blood of a priest
In a room where the ceiling leaks of crimson grease
Where the living eats the dead and the dead reek
Rock bottom transforms human beings to beasts
Why the fuck you think we got canine teeth?
It's the optical stimuli of watching men cry
I hope I've got time to repent before I die
Bury me at the beach if the sea is out of reach
'Cause when I speak what's fluid becomes concrete
Like a falcon up in the sky, ten thousand feet
Looking down at you bitches looking at me
Phase shifting to 45°
I'm too crooked to see, I memorize the books that I read
Sucking from the breast of knowledge – constantly weaning
Unbeseemingly a genius without meaning
Try to visualize what Harry Houdini was feeling
Handcuffed underwater without breathing
Near death on a fatal quest for air
But why should anyone care? He put himself there
His career was based on facing his fears
To take destiny from the hand of the man upstairs
He didn't mind the cold stares he got from his peers
They couldn't tell him where he was going or how to get there
It's better to be prepared and fail
Than to be scared and unsure of yourself and still get killed
Don't rhyme like I used to but I still got skills
More than a couple confirmed kills under the belt
Hunting MCs like hunting elk
Camouflaged in the dense brush for stealth, determined as Hell
I don't do this for anybody except myself
Stuff a motherfucker like a trophy on my shelf
Fuck the promo nigga I do this for dolo
Flow from the first hour to 24:00
Round the clock as long as I've got a cup of cocoa
But I'll be a no-show if my girl cries, ""Don't go!""
And she gives me blow more than two times in a row
I'd rather chill with her than kill you with a rhyme that I wrote
Count how many mics I smoke minus the G.O.A.T
'Bus is dope, my battling average higher than most
When I'm on the mic I release fire from throat
If you disagree please do it quietly folks
Anybody better than Bis must be a hoax
Black man? No! What about the Great White Hope?
What? Man you must be sniffing great white coke
Don't you know that's like Gary Coleman fighting the Hulk?
Still not even quite that close, a great white
Biting your rubber dingy boat 50 miles out from the coast
What the fuck is the Mathers with you?
I'll beat you black and blue then I'll get a tat of you too
Better yet I'll put a tattoo of me on you
A ten by ten 'C' logo – neon blue
The most theatrical MC battle of all time
I rip jackers like you, you know my call sign
Killer cobras that hover over Jehovah
In motorized auto-giros with sycamore rotors
Hydrogen-peroxide, gaseous vapors
Technically these words shouldn't even rhyme off paper
In theory, for every soul that can hear me, I'ma blaze them
In practical practice my style's even greater
Can't you see what I'm spitting? Can't you hear the difference?
Compared to me you're energetically inefficient
You need ten times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes
You've got to rewind every one of my lines
Do you know how to paraphrase?
Do you even understand what the narrator is tryna say?
The climax explodes, nobody can foreshadow my flow
Figuratively the language is too dope
Academic journals print my lyrical quotes
They show parallelism in all the albums I wrote
On any track I come off strong automatically
Whether I write in an active or passive capacity
Poetry that I spit is synonymous to a glyph
Written on tablets of clay mortar mix
Superb, truly superb! Analyze the words
It's like observing the birds fly above the Earth
The Eye of Horus, the miniature torii within a giant torus
With singularity on the chorus, I still sound enormous
Borderline insanity trying to break through humanity's border
With a new curriculum every quarter
I'm the porter of the portal of the Secret Mic Club Order
Baptize you with Jamaican white rum and water
If you've got a hundred bars then I know you're a warrior
I'll be the one who awards you and pins the medal on you
Dedicate a song to you because now you're honorable
You want a record deal?
Explain the lyrical Grand Unified Field so I can test your skill
Do it in front of the class, chart diagram it
And write it in Latin not Spanish god damn it
Step back so I can look at it
(No puede entender las palabras que digo senior Williams?)

Now on some battling shit, my verbal lateral grip
Keeps my tongue glued to the A-Dat when I'm tracking my shit
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits cause I'm back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit
Meditating on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign
With a deeper conscience than the prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggas get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talking, but I ignore it
Cause it's garbage and your rhyme's boring
So keep standing on the corner
The trash man will collect you in the morning
Thug cats fronting, wacker than Blinky Blink
On the back of the Raptor Wagon babbling about nothing
Fuck that, real Rugrats can get it on black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy niggas get mugged at
So dark you never see the blood splat
And you can't even react cause the trunk is where you keep the guns at
Now you on speed cause you too scared to come back
You can't even breathe, the weed suffocates your lung sacs
Fake MCs haul ass like they running track
Where ever Canibus or Rakim is at


Be ready and at your best, the Celebrity Match of Death
Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest
Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch your breath
Then I asked the ref, ""How many cats is left?""
One on one, who challenging? Come get did
All I have is a pen and punishing kids
Abdomen punctured in, look what I done to his wig
Wanna live then I stab 'em in the lung with his rib
Every word I say detach a vertebrae from your spine
Rematch wherever we meet at, any place any time
Get your snot-box smashed with a nine, smacked with a rhyme
Push your forehead to the back of your mind
Try to explain, what it's like seeing your brain
You're insane, whose gonna ID the remains?
And then I reincarnate 'em, and kill 'em again
Again and again, again and again, c'mon


Yo, yo, yo we started the battle with a grapple
The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful
And chopped him in the Adam's apple
His partner in back of you tried to attack you
So I'ma twist 'em up like a pretzel then I'ma tag you

I'm on some Stone Cold shit, warn your whole clique
Cartilage getting torn until the whole bone split
Who want to spit, bang 'em quick, strangle 'em wit his lip
Try to flip, leave his body dangling by his hip

Ra, you left him dangling
I can't believe he tryna grapple again
I swing him around like I'm dancing with him
Put his arms in back of his head and snapped him again
Fractured his limbs and put him in the figure 6 subtracted from 10

Seven birds make 'em swerve till their vision is blurred
Turn cats that souped from superb to nerds
Just say the word, I'll leave your DNA on the curb
And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard
 Let me finish 'em
 Nah, its time to pin 'em
 Ra, lemme finish 'em
 Nah, I'mma pin 'em
 Nah, Lemme finish 'em
 Nah, it's time to pin 'em
 C'mon, Ra, lemme finish 'em
 Nah 'Bis, I'mma put it in 'em",https://genius.com/Canibus-ill-buss-em-u-punish-em-lyrics
Levitibus,Rip the Jacker,2003,"""You want power...but you're not big enough
So you steal it piece by piece, tainted and spoiled
And you're weak... step by step you'll weaken and the power....
""

I harness the power of the chakra, remote viewing into darkness
Describing what I see in the process
Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects
Geoglyphs on the Pampa
A dose of polaramine makes it feel like a dream
The dream state is the playground for the supreme
Critics attempt to follow a trend
Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men
To create a universe all I need
Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees
Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber
Keep the noise down so I don't arouse my neighbors
Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman
In an unopened Coca-Cola can
Showed the whole plan in coded program
Encrypted by a ProScan modem with a low band
Hold up, let me load it in

""Put a curse on you""
""You want to take over""
“You clash with cyanide gas and die fast”
""Another mystery"" ""Are you gonna put a curse on me""
""There's no need""
“Rhythmical equivalent of solids, liquids and gas”

I was created by intelligent design
You are merely a descendant of the unmodified
You diss me out of pride, but when you're finished
Talking about money and bitches you're simply out of rhymes
Even my worst album was sublime
If I don't slow down, I'll distort the timeline
Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again
A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon
The grand architect
Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory
 
but I lost the bet
No regrets, you live and you learn
I'm through giving advice, I just give concern
Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs
And try to rebuild all the bridges I've burned
I prefer modesty over controversy
But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me
Jealous because they can't rhyme like me
And they never had a scientific mind like me


I'm above average with verbal semantics
The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad
They look at me like, ""Poor bastard
Why can't you manipulate Billboard with all your metaphor magic?""
No matter how hard I practiced
Every microphone I saw I grabbed it, obviously that's the wrong tactic
I went through a long period of mourning and sadness
When I wrote that Stan shit
But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so
And I'll come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls
If you can find a better flow?
Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago
Hey, you shouldn't fall for the naivete
Lyrically I'm the illest but my beats is okay
Food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain
Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day
I'm ahead of my time or so they say
I guess that's why I already feel old and grey
OK, that's enough knowledge for today, I'm killing them
You better not forget it 'cause this is Levitibus",https://genius.com/Canibus-levitibus-lyrics

Ate that rat inside out, let me find out
Look up in the sky and cry out what I'm about
Before we start, there's a couple things we gotta iron out
Hip Hop scalding hot, don't care who know my name and not
I chose to kill a microphone on the block
Double barrel apparel, pull back and cock it
Collaborate that, where the fuck is the deposit?
If it ain't a threat, then it must be a promise
You said my name so much, they think you being honest
It's more than that, we could've recorded a track
You could give me a stack for a verse just like that

Lyrical Noir,Lyrical Law,2011,"Gimme some more slack on this rope
I run your boney-ass throat over in a zodiac boat
46 degrees north, 6 degrees east
The Large Hadron Collider gave birth to a beast that speaks
They quote my speech, vocal motifs over dope beats
All lyricists know me
That’s why the industry’s debunking my lyrics
With digital trunking equipment, they don’t want you to listen
The Ripper’s language won’t appeal to the masses
Because they look past it
Only the masters know the seal of the scarab
Some humans are born average based off environmental circumstances
You organic piece of shit, you substandard
But do not be embarrassed by your underdeveloped status
It’s up to you to find the right questions and ask it
Research leads to results, sometimes we find meaning after
Other times they’re just meaningless babblers
Don’t believe these rappers fake unbelievable bastards
Comet Elenin is coming straight at us, don’t believe NASA
Take matters into your own hands
Stop being slow and acting like hoes, get with the fucking program
Hip Hop is the greatest genre known to man
If we focus, the poetry is so advanced
We can overthrow any plan and control man
You got soul? Let’s Jam! Lyrical Law, I’m the Canibus Man
What’s the buying-minimum? 88 sales, program
And the number of stores, I don’t care no more
This is Lyrical Law Noir, hardcore raw
Metaphors for you and yours, you can’t say you wasn’t warned!
Thousands of bars, them dummies couldn’t stomach my bars
They rather conform, they throwing up their pompoms
You don’t wanna wrestle with Armstrong
We sever blood vessels tryna mess with the gods' poem
Damage any motherfucking beat that I rhyme on
Connect to the gods' thoughts, project your iPod, I grind hard
Intellectual hardboard, take it back to Hip Hop style wars
Grunting like a pack of wild boars
Power source Lyrical Law my bomb squad full force
Call ‘em off we got too much torque
Nitrous Oxide Bars pull a bull off course
Pitchfork to your neck just to prove I’m raw
Iron horse, smack DVD, battle rap boss
Slap you with the flat part of the sword, now you back for more
Passing yourself off like a rap star, but you support whack bars
That’s why rap is lost — fact!
You a Cool J crack whore
You snitch like police labradors tryna sniff out Sasquatch
Man up, no more lip-service and backwalls
Stand up! I’ma break off your back paws, thor’s hammer crack jaws
Attack y'all, fracture your scull
Mountain man axe to your loins
Self-employed like Donald Goines
Cash cows on steroids
I don’t fall for deceptions or decoys
I’m a beast and I’m clairvoyant
Yo soy gon' tear the beat up, whether or not you appear on it
Double trouble dear promise
Fuck you and your comets
The chairman and Lyrical Law will be honored
The last man standing, after the internet is abandoned
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
The cops brainwashed Hip-hop
And they came from Saturn
They were the first alien race of rappers
They landed in North-Africa
Their teeth be gnashing
Their names look like acronyms
They released the kraken
They live in underground cabins
They sliver fast through the inner-earth labyrinth
They move in S-patterns though deep planet chasms
I chase ‘em and trap ‘em
Detailing the action
For try’na desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master, faggots
I laid them on top of each other like Abu Ghraib
They spacecraft look like the Eiffel tower in Paris
They pray for my downfall and orchestrated hip-hop’s imbalance
They underestimated my talent
I hold the globe up like Atlas
They lied about Canibus — ask ‘em
I’m the world’s greatest motherfucking rapper!
They slandered my character through the public propaganda
They tell the people I’m Dr. Doppelganger
They ask me shit, did they know I’m not gon' answer?
Extinction level event, they can’t stop the disaster
Cocksucker stop the camera, cause you know that I’m a miserable bastard
I crack lens, break microchips and melt plastic
You Canibus? – Who’s asking?
That’s Captain Cold Crush to you maggot, You a lyrical has-been
Lyrical Law’s a classic, they can’t get past it
The beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet
Lyrical Law’s a classic they can’t get past it
They beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet
The microphone assassin ’bout to get at ‘em
The Dragon of Judah breathe fire ’til its last breath
Full battle-rapper in action lyrical metal jackets
Coming through, with several new attachments
Computers is crashing, hackers is laughing
Rapid eye movement, try to keep up with the captain

No Return,Rip the Jacker,2003,"No return...

Yo, scientists gather in a secret place to debate
They photographed the Earth from Space and saw my face
They tried to translate the innate asiatic shape
Before the final earthquakes came but it was too late
Only one eighth of the human race escaped to space
They were chased by flying phenomenon to the lunar base
Flotillas and space centers, lasers probed the entrance
DNA code sensors reject old genetics
I presented my cosmic clearance to a patrol of medics
I was injected with sodium pentathol and questioned
I relayed the message the way I was trained to remember it
I showed them the keypad code and told 'em to enter it
I told 'em which alphanumeric buttons were sensitive
He snatched it outta my hand and started depressing it
I told him detonation was definite if he kept at it
He never quit, he just lost his temper and flipped
I bowed my head like ""I guess this is it""
My ears popped, the music stopped and I couldn't hear shit

The driver jogged around to the front and opened the door
He said his name was Muhammed Jamal and he'd be with me till fall
He said the escort service had called
And a package would be waiting for me at the window
I said, ""Thanks"", he grabbed my bags fast and put 'em in the trunk
Then he ran around to the front, slammed it in gear
Pulled off slow, winding down his window
And asked me if I minded if he smoke, I said, ""No"", he drove off
Cut my cellphone off, then I swallowed a tablet of Zoloft
Went to sleep and woke up feeling kinda lost
I asked him what the weather's been like lately
He said he doesn't mind the heat and hates the A/C
Said he had a son who was eighteen and made beats
And I happened to be his favorite emcee
I said for real, that's crazy, I meet him later
Yo, Jamal could you please do me a favor
When we get to the corner stop at the bodega
Hopped out the car, walked inside
The store's stereo was playing Feliz Navidad
I got a pack of condoms and walked to the back of the line
There was three Taliban that was talking very loud
One reached in his backside and pulled out a Beretta gun
The last word I heard myself say was a four letter one
He looked me in the eye and said the drama's never done
Cause there's 'No Return'

I heard the ringtone of the red phone
Headquarters informed us there was an explosion in the red zone
We were ordered to get ready to go
And to get into our bio-weapons protective gear and clothes
I rode shotgun, my partner Ramirez drove
GPS control gave us coordinates where to go
Soon as we got there I could feel the hot air
For a second I stopped and stared, there was cops everywhere
I told 'em we need to get a square perimeter clear
We got an hour till nightfall so light some flares
I said a twenty second prayer then ran to the second chair
The lift that was there, then I waved my hands up in the air
To signal that it was clear before I ran upstairs
I could barely see, smoke was so thick in the air
I was visually impaired and started to get scared
I heard a woman scream, ""Help!"" but I didn't know where
I started screaming back, ""I'm not gonna leave you here""
Saying to myself, ""Damn, it's hard to breathe in here""
Searched the rooms one by one like, ""fuck my lungs""
Ramirez said the fire truck got stuck by the front
I crawled all the way through the foyer to the end of the hallway
And seen her on the floor next to the doorway
I was half unconscious but I just ignored the pain
Helped her to her feet and she had her arm in a brace
All this tar-like black stuff was all in her face
I radio Ramirez coughing and tried to explain
I heard him say something to me like, ""It's all in flames!""
There was ceiling debris falling all over the place
I looked her in her eye, she looked into mine, it was strange
Then I blinked for the last time and never saw her again

2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000,"My offense is a mixture of Mike and Muhammad
Knock a nigga unconscious and talk shit
In bare-knuckle boxin', speed is the object
Weavin' and dodgin' with defensive blockin'
So in the ring, you cannot win
The top ten become nine dead if I ever decide to hop in
With the one-two, one-two shot to the chin
Knock you out, like ten shots of vodka and gin
The beautiful blend of power and strength
From the top of my head, down to where my toe cuticles end
I verbally burn a nigga, lyrically hurt a nigga
Put a voodoo verse on a nigga, Kennedy curse a nigga
Who can spit the words quicker than the average man?
Who can embarrass a man? Bite you with fangs
And mangle your hands on candid cam? The Canibus can
The Canibus can, with the stamina to damage a man

It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to

Yo, I spit for it, rhyme for it, live for it, die for it!)
Back out the 9, commit a homicide for it
If I'm handcuffed with the right to remain silent for it
I'ma blow trial and do the federal time for it
You mad at the last album, I apologize for it
Yo, I can't call it, motherfuckin' Wyclef spoiled it
But this time for '99 I got 5 on it
You should double up and put a dime on it
Matter of fact, triple your nickel and put 14.99 on it
I'ma shine on it, watch Flex drop the bomb on it
About ten times on it, watch people call a request line for it
Cipha Sounds keep pushin' rewind on it
Look out for the album with the Canibus design on it
12 o'clock in the morning you'll be standing on line for it
I'm a live poet, with a sharp ear and eye for it
‘Cause I tear down mics and put a out-of-order sign on it

It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
I told y'all, (C'mon!) I roast y'all, (C'mon!)

Yo, I rip shit with the ballistic characteristics
Of a hollow-tip at point-blank distance
I flip shit when I spit shit; Father, forgive Bis
I just snatched the Jesus piece off some Christians
‘Cause they sounded like idiots
They went from silver to gold to platinum
After the millennium they'll probably be wearing Iridium
They so gassed, if a bitch sucked they dick
They'd probably cum helium
Y'all niggas can't be serious, I was nice before ice
Before Christ, before the words, ""Let there be light""
And a light took over the night, I was born with a mic
Lord of the mic, before all plant and animal life
Took this rap shit to new heights
Before the Wright brothers took flight
Before dog fightin' and aerial strikes
Before MC's picked up pens and started to write
Before promotional marketin' and posterlights
The Can-I-Bus'll bust up mics, punch out lights
Punch out your motherfuckin' eyesight, for the title bout fight
Ask Ty Fyffe, I snatch the track for half price
The Canibus is too nice; give me that mic!!

I've advanced beyond your flows eons ago
It's inevitable in '98 I'ma blow
Ever since '84, I've been in it to win it

We've been preyin' on that ass since ""Jack the Ripper""
And now its time to rip the jacker
(ahhhhhhhhhhh .....)

No rapper could rap quite like I can
You know who the fuck I am, I'm the Canibus man
I had to rock to a beat like this to show you
That I'm iller then the future, the present, and the old you
I told you, wish you could take it all back don't you
Tried to smoke some cannabis but Canibus smoked you
Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do
Cause after I humiliate you what will the G.O.A.T. do
You can't rap or act my main man
You goin' end up as an intern working for Def Jam
See you was never bad enough to battle with Canibus
You out of luck, I crushed you the minute I got tatted up
And every lie you told just added up cause you wasn't man enough
To be fair, but I'm mad as fuck and I've had enough
Jack the ripper or I'mma rip the jacker
Rape a rapper with a classic from his own masters
You're dead

There's a rumor going around that I got dropped
200,000 albums sold at 10 dollars a pop
300,000 albums were shipped, you do the math
Thats 3 million in 3 months so kiss my ass
All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death
Guess what, the G.O.A.T. ain't platinum and neither is 'Clef
And I'm still here, inspite of all that shit them niggas said
The skinny kid, the music industry's guinea pig
Tighter than ever, world's chief mic wrecka
Tougher than Reverend Run's muthafuckin' leather
I'm hardcore, cum shot right in your wife's face
You soft porn, you held hands on the first date
See when you was making records like I need love
Your homie Cornell was givin' it to you up the butt
Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut
And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss
Nigga you're dead

You married a slut and had kids with her to cover up your hustle
You and your man Russell made a better couple
Your probably mad as fuck, wondering where I got the information from
Your being watched even when you take a dump
Its impossible to front, you can't hide
The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes
You're living one big lie, the world just don't know
You take a polygraph test that shit would probably explode
The truth is Mr. Smith you got a fucked up attitude
God knows that I pity your fans for backing you
Yo, this be the realest shit I ever wrote
You should change your muthafuckin' name from G.O.A.T. to G.L.O.A.T
The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme
That cannot shine as long as I'm alive
Your prime ended 8 months before '99
And that microphone on your arm will always be mine
Nigga you're dead

I told you to leave it alone, but you was too stubborn
Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted
Your wife is scared cause she don't want to lose a husband
And somebody keeps paging you putting 4321 in
You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama
Shit stains all up in your phat farm pyjamas
Even f.u.b.u. gear looks hot until it touches you
Probably because your father undoubtedly butt-fucked you
Mama said knock who out? I'll punch that bitch in the mouth
Cause she don't know what she talking about
Ay yo, do me a favor when you see your ghostwriters
Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter
You could have asked me, I'll write you some lines
I'll do anything for the greatest loser of all time
You still drippin' with wack juice cause you wack nigga
If you want the last word you can have it, I'm still iller

You see, that's my problem, I spit a thousand bars y'all was silent
I ain't heard nothing about it
I had to give you three years to recognize
And then I realized, can't nobody even fuck with my rhymes
The Internet is an early telepathic building set
My lyrics are international nuclear missile threats
The blogosphere is where you vent frustration and discontent
But children don't understand the concept of consequence
So yes, it's immature to express disrespect
But no I will not accept what the media says
They are the reason we are being misled
There are forces above them that feed off our stress, suffering and debt
I am Dead by Design, cause nobody tells me what to rhyme
I make up my own fucking mind
There are more of us than them
But at the same time they are gods and we are just mortal men
Thirteen levels above 33, let me say it again
They are gods and we are just mortal men
I cannot imagine their power
They put a black family in the White House just so they can take away ours
You tryna to plan a great escape? You're a coward
They gon' make us march into a gas chamber make us think we're taking a shower
Mommas and babies is crying
The children of Zion belong to Skynet, nobody knows who's behind it
So if you don't care, fine then, I don't care either
But I ain't spineless like you, I'm a true believer
In the metaphysical aether, you listening to the lyrical reaper
The spiritual teacher, empirical speaker
After this album they gon' call me a leader
But I'm not, Killuminati just gon' murder me like Pac
Blood sacrifice or not, I don't even wanna be alive
If it's like that, then fuck Tiamaat
You can laugh at my appearance
Well fuck you for standing there staring, fuck everything on this planet
Including the evil spirits, notwithstanding the aliens
Acting like they don't hear us, there's no need to fear us
Just come done and help us, I love James Brown more than I love Elvis
But that don't mean I'm selfish
Soft but hard on the outside like shellfish
Crispy, crunchy, black crawling out of Hell's pit
You scream for hardcore, I felt it
But what you gon' do when they kill me on some Eminem and L shit?
You won't do a motherfucking thing
Cause let me tell you why, you a coward and you don't know shit
Cause if my Brothers stand next to me, the energy expands collectively
The world was never ready for me
And they ain't ready for their own freedom neither, they perish from the heater
The fire breathers crawl out of their cage to eat 'em
Like thin crust pizza, Cthulhu creatures with rough features
Jeepers creepers, good luck with Jesus
How many meters? Reload and squeeze it
I run up in the Vatican with demons, just to get even
That's where the biggest demon is
It's no secret, but nobody else sees it, so they won't believe it
But that's when I calm back down, the key word is back down
I got possessed by my own raps, wow
Knock knock, who's home? The black Dan Brown
I didn't mean what I said, please don't kill me now
My ghostwriter's not around, plus it was just a freestyle
But at least I got better beats now
Meanwhile, motherfuckers still mad, I feel bad
I'd apologize but you acting like a real fag
What the fuck I'm supposed to feel like?
Twelve years later I still don't get acknowledged for shit that I write
But I don't want to talk to you now
It'd be a motherfucking miracle if you even see me walking around
They still ask me about 'Second Round' even now
(Interviewers voice) Canibus can you tell us of what happened again? - Look at this fucking clown
Can't get over it, they ask me a loaded question
And act like I was the one promoting it, hang up on 'em
You a cyborg unit with no soul to it
Stupid surrogate, twelve years later I'm on some other shit
And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships
And so is the whole world, look at the mother ships

After this album they gon' call me a leader but I'm not
The Illuminati just gon' murder me like they did Pac
Blood sacrifice or not
It's Professor Griff the ex-minister

I put a pistol in your mouth to full, then I feed you to the pit bulls
Don't even talk about guns
The only nine you got is a five dollar bill and four one's
So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggas say
‘Cause anything that can't penetrate ricochet's
Rhyming with me on a record?
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
‘Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession, I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampire's reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck mode
Explode, leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in

Is that all soldier?
Yes, sir!
Is there anything you need?
No, sir!
Report back to me before the briefing, at ease!
Are you a Navy SEAL?
(Yes, sir!)
Then say it like you mean it!
Tell them who Free from the Navy Seal team is!

Free be the one rocking shit, special operatives
Specializing in weapons diagnostics
My survival tactics be drastic like Rambo
I'm strangling niggas with my bow and arrow elastic
Whoever said you couldn't be 5 feet and thoroughbred
Never witnessed the cerebral cortex in my head
How many gigabytes does your hard drive hold?
Or does your hard drive fold once the signal hits the node?
Beyond mission control, the theory behind your thought
Marie Antoinette behead me, I still rock
While you choking, suffocating off your own testosterone
I'm known for breaking levels down to the values unknown
A specimen with extraterrestrial estrogen
Kick your intestines in, sell your testicles to Mexicans
I bring the force like a nutcracker
Annihilate rhyme hackers, Navy Seal linebacker
The last Oedipus remains unclaimed
So if you buck against Free, you better tattoo your name
On your teeth
I disintegrate those that oppose
Disintegrate hoes with they assholes in they nose
I suppose you wanna run your mouth like castanet
I put bitch niggas to rest in a bitch bassinet

Is that all soldier?
Yes, sir!
Is there anything you need?
No, sir!

Are you a patriot?

I'm the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitch-ass niggas and bitch-ass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 4/5th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual I'm as different as anybody's fingerprint is
If boring is the norm, I'm the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt-naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you too scared to do shit
I'm the type of nigga that will prove it, produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
‘Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I'll survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod

Yeah, Canibus

This is Melatonin Magik, Sumerian, Chinese, Egyptian, Latin
Nobody can match Canibus when I'm rappin' (What happened?)
Captain Cold Crush get it crackin'
Theres more than one person right now that's not laughin'
Squash microphones with unknown chromosomes
To discover the codes that controls the brain's frontal lobes
The pineal gland glows (Go, go, go, go, go!)
Don't look back, I got ya back bro
He's a high profile target, code name Sergeant Armpits
He was Rakim Allah's first artist
""Lemme bus' em; nah, I'mma punish em, Ra!""
I'mma show you how the mothafuckin' government lied
Got nothin' to do with pride, you must realize
Few of us will be alive by Solar Cycle Twenty-Five
I tried to look for solutions, that's not enough time
They won't be satisfied til every one of us die
Aight, calm the fuck down and listen to my rhymes
The only way that you can free yourself is your mind
First thing you gotta do is put the antagonism behind
Then you gotta put ya life on the line
The reward is great; the risk? Even greater
Fellowship can only make a Braveheart braver
Watch who you followin', watch who you praisin'
""Yes We Can"" backwards is ""Thank You Satan""
Yes, I'm Jamaican, Yes, I'm a patriot
No, I will not forsake you for a paycheck
YES this is victory, YES I can taste it
NO I'm not a Mason, I'm followin' my trainin'
They monitor my body functions from central London
My heart rate is thumpin', I suffer from numbness
A robot arm shoves the drugs in
My scrubs are disgustin' and sullen, I smell like cub skin
Funky, funky, funky odor; Bridgewater, South Dakota
My spit fizz like soda, I'm in a coma
In a pagoda, nurse McLovin'
Says she wouldn't fuck me if I was her husband, don't trust the bitch
I'm in a warehouse alone, I hear doors open and close
No phone, no Intercom controls
Wouldn't matter anyway I'm in a paranormal zone
Goose bumps grow, I could hear a few ghosts moan
I'm a mastermind
Tryna amplify the frequency of the rhyme
So I can learn to fly
So yeah, fuck a punchline
I'm past that prime, that's not a crime
So go find someone else to dick ride
Focus on the truth, it's long overdue
It woulda never happened if I told you what I wanted to do
The Inconvenient Truth is a convenient truth
2012 solar cycle 24 comin' soon
I promise you, Canibus achieved the impossible
It's only logical its time for the truth
Whether I'm gonna be around to witness it or not
I spit this shit for hip-hop
Twitter niggas type their hype they write Canibus smash the mic
'Cause you can't blackball the light
They know my hands always been tied
You call that a fight?
Give me the mic, I call in an airstrike
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
There's some things in this world that money can't buy
Respect, honor, fuck it, it's all corrupted
The media can not be trusted
You shouldn't need a budget to rep Hip Hop
You don't have to suck dick just to get your shot
Just work with what you got, don't be a robot, be human
Influenced by hip-hop music
It ain't nothin like, it ain't nothin like

Its called Melatonin Magik and music, no bullshit
Take it back to 1997 exclusive Clue shit
The most abusive MC in hip-hop music
Lyrically you can't do shit

Uh!
Melatonin Magik allows no MC's energy to escape
I seal their fate
Canibus, the last MC at God's gate
Melatonin Magik, uh
Melatonin Magik, the perfect absorber of light and all energy frequencies

DJ Clue

Word up!
Yo, what up? This is Canibus about to black out
Representin' Group Home, shout out to Lost Boyz, Def Squad
Charles Suitt, Mr. Sexx, DJ Clue, and Desert Storm
Let's drop it
Haha! Hoo! Canibus, freestyle, niggas know, Clue!

Yo, I speak at frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin'
Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineering
Raw metaphors keep you high for months
Fly around the Earth twice without refuelin' once
Ain't too many categories I can fit in when it come to spittin'
'Cause I'm overqualified for the position
The laser-guided lyrical hybrid
Creatin' scripts so sick, I gotta arm-wrestle my pen to write it
Don't get excited, 'cause if I ever catch one of you wannabe's bitin'
We're gonna be fist-fightin'
So motherfuckers, what you want? I got the shotgun pumped
You feel like a frog, nigga? Then jump
I posses the lyrical ammo to battle
And rip any one of you warm-blooded mammals to shambles
I make examples of you and eat a mouth full of ya crew
The type of MC you can't outdo
I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh
I'll battle you over the phone, you can call me collect
I'll battle you for the respect, I'll battle you over a blank cheque
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
I'll battle you standin' over the toilet with my dick out
I'll battle you jugglin' a hand grenade with the pin out
In a stolen car with the VIN number ripped out
Drinkin' a Guinness Stout, doin' a 360 spin-out
I stay righteous like Farrakhan, puffin' on the marijuan'
You understand where I'm comin' from?
You number one? Then I'm negative two
Basically, nigga, that means I'm still better than you
Basic mathematics, the verbal mechanics of rhymin'
Behold, I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond
On the microphone, I'm sicker than those
Who've Acquired-Immune-Deficiency-Syndromes
And every word I utter for hip-hop lovers
Will reflect forever like two mirrors facin' each other
The baddest M-Other, F-Ucker
Let me break the style down so you don't have to wonder
I walk the B-Lock with G-Lock C-Ocked
Tryin' to get the D-R-Op on the C-Ops
Blow spots, capsize boats, shipwreck yachts
Head-shots hit you at 300 nautical knots
You callin' the cops, complainin' about the hip-hop
Gettin' Benjamin's like The L-OX, it don't stop
Eh-eh, eh-eh, put away your burners, you can't serve us
My whole camp is allergic to bein' murdered
Metaphors is proof I got more than just a couple screws loose
Latinos call me the Black Jesús
So for all who believe the telekinesis of Jesus
I touch a paraplegic and heal him",https://genius.com/Canibus-dj-clue-freestyle-lyrics

Yeah, this is Spartibus
Yo, yo, yo

You wanna spar with Bus, then let's get started, cuz
Atomic thrusts turn you into cosmic dust
Bomb your borders with Japanese Spigot mortars
Recompose your composition to sawdust
Time is breath, breath is life, life is light
Light is no less than capital C on the mic
Beneath the mirage of night, I'll attack you twice
Prepare the river sacrifice for my ritual rites
Reinforce my habitual likes and dislikes
Then diss you on the mic 'cause I'm sick of the hype
No one's ever written what I write, compare the calligraphy type
Tell me yo, how can I not be nice?
The royal semen of Caesar frozen in a cryofreezer
On sale for seven figures per milliliter
Lethally illegal, I speak to the people
In the form of an eagle on top of the Thebes Cathedral
With boundless knowledge like hairless Dalai Lamas
With linen garments neatly wrapped around armpits
With monasteries in the mountains
Trumpets have already sounded, you can't denounce my crown bitch

Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods

This game is Chinese chess
Countless issues need to be addressed before the East nukes the West
Totalitarianistic cause and effect
Run the words through a decompressor, recompress the depth
Canibus is the most explosive next to meth
The inconsistency of the text makes me complex
Pay attention to Bis, my intention is this
Leave you spatially adrift, suspended in the abyss
Marijuana plant owner, smell my aroma
Contract scirrhous carcinoma and retinoblastoma
Confederate federal general, the electric general
FCC, omni-directional antenna poles
IFF, identification friend or foe
This areas restricted, don't let 'em through
He'll mock your style, rock you to the ground
With the bite force of a Sarcosuchus crocodile
Travel a fiber optic mile before you can smile
So don't ask me why and don't ask how

Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Now tear it up y'all and bless the mic for the gods

Until I'm impressed with the print, I can hear a pin drop like Sprint
Once it blends I can stop right then
Quantum coupling mechanisms and technical shit
Confuses you, but I don't think you're any less of a dick
Just define what is poetry and what is rap
I demonstrate how to effectively bridge the gap
The answer is simple in fact
If the protons don't attack the retina, all we'd ever see is black
No ability, no extraocular motility
Silly MCs can't see me lyrically or visually
They'll never be better than me
I'll triple team 'em with a trinity severed in 3 and give 'em 9 enemies
Climb back to periscope depth in 2 hours
Surrender and throw in the towel
The amalgam of the ultimate album, this is Spartibus power

Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm

Genabis,Rip the Jacker,2003,"Genabis
This is Genabis, remember this

In the beginning, I discovered wordplay
I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day
On the fourth, I searched for the words to say
How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space
I was perfect at it and mastered the tactics
On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics
On the sixth day I became a fanatic and I couldn't kick the habit
I would just look in the mirror and practice
On the seventh cycle, I had to take the day off
I was exhausted, I guessed my work will never pay off
But if it happened it to Him, it could happen to me
And if it happened to me, it was destined to be

Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough

They backslide back to church and call a minister's bluff
They rather remain unenlightened then listen to Bus
I blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt
I was the first rapper to ever to close orbit the Sun
One small step for man, one huge step for mankind
I am the red giant of rhymes
Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second
Flow is untested, those that I've threatened fold under pressure
At 120 beta cycles, high volts ignite your eyeballs
Until you see the fire in front of you
Optic cone's rods, melt one at a time till you realize you in Hell
Rip the Jacker's not done with you
I terrorize the rap community with impunity
Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris
What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me
Those in pursuit of me will never get through to me

Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough
Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus
There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch
I read the cosmos, what God wrote predicted as much
The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough

First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically
Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy
My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly
Look at the Victorian tapestry in back of me
Notice the post renaissance pictures I drew
Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca Peru
The followable audio propagates the possible truth
For proof I'm the illest so the choice is not unto you
See the standard ideological definition of a rap model
Puts Canibus in scholarly periodicals
The article is substantially impressive, more than a message
A working thesis from several different perspectives
The Rosetta stone of sentences for rap music's tentative
Entered apprentices, this is Genabis

How We Roll,Can-I-Bus,1998,"I never freestyle for free, without chargin' niggas a fee
It'll cost you a brain cell just to cypher with me

I don't give a fuck if you ignore me or camcord me
Freestyle or written, spittin' with infinite ammunition
For anybody tryin' to go the distance
I promise ya no less than a hundred-thousand kilometers
My bomb threats'll have you evacuatin' your continent
I'm barbaric with the alphanumeric
Hittin' you with lyrics that separate your body from your spirit
This is for wack niggas doin' shows and shit
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin it
(Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holdin it)

I roll with the wildest niggas
West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas
The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas
Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas

We savages, snatchin' microphones from amateurs
Cause like women who get abortions, I ain't havin' it
I rip you, my metaphor content, will split you
Into little powder-like crystals so I can sniff you
What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian
Your rhymes are phonier than cubic zirconias
Have you any idea what I do to crews like you
How many niggas in my career, I ran through?
Comin' after ya, blastin' ya
With the shotgun like a front seat passenger
You must be askin' for some sort of a massacre
I'll attack ya cardiovascular
Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes
When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses
Rip your speaker to ashes, and kick a hole in it

MC's can't see me 'cause I'm too quick for the human retina to register
I roll up on ya crew quicker than long sleeves
At a Speed that would confuse Keanu Reeves

I'm the illest MC that you ever seen in your fuckin' life
I hop into the backseat of a cab and rhyme
Till the meter says nine, nine, nine, nine
Line for line I battle any kind of MC at any time
Whether they signed or unsigned
With many lines, more lines than a million pair of Adidas
More lines than the Bible quoted from Jesus
More lines than a African herd of zebras
Niggas just ain't fuckin' with the Canibus sativa
This is for all you niggas doin' shows and shit
'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controllin' it

Only Slaves D.R.E.A.M.,Melatonin Magik,2010,"Do you think that the powers that be
Are goin' to let you do what you want to do for eternity?
Of course you don't, so what do you fear?
Why you spazzin' out, why you so scared?
Everybody wanna be first
Nobody wants to be last
Do you think a God that created this would watch all of us die while others just laugh?
What happens when the money system crash?
And there's no more value in the cash?
You gon' suck dick and sell ass?
You gon' try to fight back with ya hands?
You probably change your money into gold
You gon' use that to try and buy soul
Buy some drugs with it, buy a piece of hole
Don't tell me, I don't wanna know
You need to come up with a better plan
The Devil smash metal weapons like glass
Right now we out-matched and outclassed
We have to stay on a spiritual path
Cause in the absence of love, we blastin' one another with blood
Media shows up to capture the buzz
I'm a child of God, not a rapper from the gutter
I'm six of one and half a dozen of the other
This is not one of those ""I told you so"" moments
This is just Canibus being open
Lower egoic minds brush aside
But can't nullify the high science that is coming from the rhymes
I couldn't believe it the day that I was told
That every person alive does not have a soul
And is not in control of these cotton pickin' polls
Politicians declare the war of attrition on the globe
And stole all the fishin' holes, Grandma got the chitlins on the stove
That'll overload the senses in your nose
Young folk can't even afford to get old
How many YouTube views before you go gold?
How many albums last week you sold? How many leaked downloads?
Oh, you still believe the Soundscan, bro?
Don't be discouraged, write and produce and record and you love it
This is your art, and that's the point of it
When you get paid from it, things change, people behave stubborn
And say rude things to judge it
They want you to thug it, so they can have you like a test subject
Handcuffed and take mug shots of it
I told you before, I'm nobody's spit puppet
I say what I want, you take what you want from it
This is a social experiment put on by the public
Hip-hop is completely corrupted
You ain't rappin' 'bout that, you ain't rappin' 'bout nothin'
I ain't never gon' starve, I been white tail huntin'
Ya'll motherfuckers is buggin', speakin' with no substance
Hip-hop's the way it is because of you cousin
It ain't my fault, you locked me out of it
99 percent of my fans ain't nothin'
But scumbag, scum buckets, blood suckin', cock fuckers
My lyrics too advanced for the average block hustler
You know my name, I'm deeply inspired
On a mountain lion meat diet, eat and be quiet
Recycle the fire and deep fry it
That line is hot, but you said it before, you get a C minus
My shit is timeless like the Great Wall of China
Sick in the biggest way like a dinosaur virus
Spreadin' through Verizon Wireless
Homeland Security's tryin' it, just to see if you lyin', Bis
They step to me, never thought it would happen like this
You a flight risk, we need that microphone back, Bis
Diversionary tactics, Magik madness
Canibus, you can't leave this miserable prison planet, God damnit
We don't care what your fans think
Cause 99 percent of all of this don't exist
The observer changes the properties of the observed
This is done with your mind, not with your words
Word? Yeah, I'm about to show you nerds
You bookworms really startin' to get on my nerves
I can't talk like you, but I can understand you
I know what this entire ordeal can expand to
I love hip-hop, I've always been a fan too
I'm a big fan of everything you do
I appreciate the purchases, the online searches
I hope you enjoy the verses, it was great to be of service
This was always my purpose
I'm always workin' to be a better person everyday

""What's the matter with ya'll, I'll spatter ya'll
Against the muthafuckin' wall with these raw lyrics I catapult
""I'll hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme
Til' the meter says 9, 9, 9, 9""
Yea, it's the C-Quel, the C-Quel, Yo!

I'm hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores
To every single pore in my skull
Hard from my mouth to my jaws
From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored
And from my balls in my draws to the floor
I pray to God they hurry up and start the third World War
So I can start World War IV and murder us all
I don't give a fuck if you rich or you poor
Don't give a fuck if you got ya' picture in The Source or Forbes
I don't give a fuck who won an award
On stage tryna' thank God I'll chop they tongue off with a sword
Let they blood pour all on the floor
If it ain't a cordless, they gettin' punched in the jaw and hung wit' the cord
I'll leave they corpse stiff as a board
Like frozen meat tryna' thaw then bury em under the morgue
Gettin' in my way is like jumpin' in front of a car
Breakin' the sound barrier, that means the car is in front of the horn
By the time you hear it blowin', it's too late to respond
By the time you feel it hit you, I'm gone
I'll send ya' to hell where you belong
So by the time ya' body hits the floor
Ya' spirit won't be in it no more
Who could flow for 4 minutes or more
Without breaks, without mistakes, without flaws
I got millions of styles and I mastered em all
A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall

""Whoever grabs the mic after me'll get booed
Get everything in the club thrown at you and ya' crew""
""I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I'll snatch ya crown with ya head still attached to it""
""I battle you for the respect, I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck""
""Ambushin' emcees, jumpin' out the trees like Vietnamese
In fatigues covered with leaves""
""Next year, you'll be walkin' around the ""How Can I Be Down""
Conference with a laminate, that said ""I Got Shitted-On By Canibus""""
""Turn ya' head round gimme the cheddar
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever""
""Fuck ya'll, you don't impress me and no one can test me
An emcee so ill I got AIDS scared to catch me""

Canibus is what the hardcore niggas is waitin' on
Debatin' on, what the fuck is takin' so long
Well I'm here now, verbal ass whippin's bout to get shared out
Wack niggas bout to get aired out
Faggot niggas get they ass teared out
Grab a wise man by his goatee and rip his fuckin' beard out
Cold beat a nigga's ass like Stout
Then bust a shot in the muthafuckin' courtroom and watch it clear out
A hundred thousand mile warranty, metaphorically
I'll use a hundred thousand styles and murder you orally
I took a lion on tour wit' me, made him respect authority
Smacked him in the head for tryna' roar at me
Lyrics got my undivided loyalty
And there ain't nothin' on this God damn planet that's worth more to me
In the name of Hip-Hop niggas could corner me, torture me
Slice me then stitch me up like embroidery
Way back before gold-plated male and female
RCA jacks was used for crystal clear playback
I was tryna' blaze ADATS, and if a nigga said my demo was wack?
I'd beat his ass and took my tape back
""Yeah, nigga""  ""What? Yeah nigga take that""
Anybody get outta' line, get they face slapped quick fast
The Can-I-Bus'll buss yo' ass
Then I'll bust you wit' a shotgun blast
It's not fun so I don't laugh
To me this rap shit is as serious as, the death of a loved one
You know how you be feelin' sad
That's how I feel when I grab the microphone but niggas don't understand
Canibus is unequivocally the illest killin' machine in the industry
For the 20th century
Trapped in a max security building
Sufferin' from a severe illness called brilliance",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-c-quel-lyrics
Dr. C. Ph.D,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"Doctor C

Yo, I plan to build myself a facility before I'm forty
A molecular archeogenetic laboratory
That can analyze complex poetry data for me even if it was recorded poorly
How extraordinary
I frog leap over awkward beats
Then I separate rappers by their Carbon-14's
To determine the age of anything ever made
Regardless of how the outside surface has changed
I put a curse on your name, bombard your brain
With gamma X-rays 'til you burst into flames
With the scientifically quantifiable megalomaniacal viable style
It's like trying to ride a bull
Let's have a dictionary duel after school
Check me into a nice Cedar Sinai room
So I can get sick as the flu, spittin' the truth
If you ain't got this album, you missing the proof
Prepare for your doom my nuclear rocket plumes
Glow against the pale background of the moon
Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods
Burning your flammable boxes and booms
Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood
Motherfucker you didn't win 'cause I can't lose
Give the fans the chance to choose, fuck you!
Who's the illest? Who's it really up to?
Rapping fire, you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in the saliva quagmire
'Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up
Cause you said Bis ain't dope, you a damn liar
Disaster for hire over beats by Kyros
Flow like the Tigris, Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris
Canibus is a fighter
Motherfucker, my great grandfather was Irish
Let's roll the dices, I'll break you like young Tyson
Give me the mic man, I don't need no hype man
Put a thousand on me, put one on him
I tear off his limbs, throw him in and tell him to swim
Yo, I soak that sugar-coated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss, turn that noise off
Call Detroit's Mafia Boss
Tell him, ""Yo, I got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls""
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws
Nobody disrespects lyrical law
I'm the best there ever is and the best ever was
Training like a grunt face down in the mud
With blood, sweat, and tears, sucking it up
Yo, you wonder where I am right now?
I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up
Dead or alive, Canibus will live through the rhyme
To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine
Spittin' divine, you can't get it twisted this time
Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align
Doctor C, Ph. D, graduated from UMG
Bright as the LCD display on a new MP
Prototype of a true MC
With 3D topography maps you can't see
Butcher on Broad Street, wrapping CD's
In butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies
If you don't like the quality, then talk to me
What the fuck you on the website for you creep?
Punching the keys, remember that sound
That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth
Kick a rap, bitch, if you've got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me, I might put a lump in your meat
Diss you and your man, double the beef
To tell you the truth, I thought your rebuttal was weak
Round the outside, blah blah, et cetera et cetera
The body of my literature is bigger than South America
Nigga look, this is all I got to say
Suck my P-H-D-I-C-K",https://genius.com/Canibus-dr-c-phd-lyrics
I Honor U,Can-I-Bus,1998,"We'll never part through sickness and health
You are my heart, I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, it'll be alright
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets

Ayo, boy meets girl, boy really likes her
Boy loses contact with girl but he finds her
Girl has no clue that boy is a liar
And he has no honor
So she dates him regardless 'cause she thought he was harmless
And he had her believin' he was the man she wanted
To spend the rest of her life with
The words ""I love you"" are priceless, unpredictable like rolling dices
Nonetheless, in spite of the frightenin' repercussions you might get
People still risk they necks
Of course it's nice, the feeling of courtship, roses and stuff
Women never get it often enough
And the reason people love they mother so much
Besides the fact she carried you for nine months, is trust
It's a five letter word, that should only occur between him and her
Before the bees and the birds, word

We'll never part through sickness and health
You are my heart ,I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, it'll be alright
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets

I heard a soft moan in the middle of March
Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart
""On your mark, get set, go!"" I was off
Flagella was my propeller wigglin' back and forth
Then I set a course for the border
Mother Nature's karma callin' me to the Rock of Gibraltar
The competition tried to be smart, but I was smarter
My competitors were swimmin' fast, so I swam harder
Submerged in water, prayin' to my Heavenly Father
If I don't make it through, I'm a goner
Screamin' out ""Death Before Dishonor""
Because I'm awesomely stronger, my stamina lasts longer
I was destined to be a son instead of a daughter
XY is the male chromosomal order
One'll stay alive, and survive, the rest'll be dead
Cause I'ma be the one to fertilize that egg

In the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, I held you tight
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets

Ayo mommy, I'm up in your stomach buggin'
Whenever you rub it, I love it
Like a comforters covers you warm as a oven
Your husband - stubborn, how can you love him?
Smokin' cigarettes by the dozen when he knows that I'm comin'
Bad move, you hopin' that daddy improves
Knowin' in your heart that's bull, because he's too cruel
You've been abused, used, you've got, wounds and scars
Think with your mind not with your heart, let's go to Grandma's
Terminate the lease, call the landlord
Give your job two weeks notice, pack up the car, and go to New York
What part? They got a little borough called the Bronx, mom
And I heard that's where hip-hop is gonna start
Hell yeah! I think we need to be right there
Four months in your stomach and I already chose a career
When you cry, I hear and I wish I could dry your tears
But I can't cause I'm stuck in here
Five months from bein' able to lay against your chest
I can't even hold you in my arms 'cause they ain't developed yet
But I swear to you, as to God's Almighty Truth
I'ma be there for you, I'ma be there for you

We'll never part through sickness and health
You are my heart ,I love you more than I love myself
But in the middle of the night
I heard you cryin' in your sleep, it'll be alright
I'll be there for you, if you tell me all your secrets
Yet in the middle of the night

The Ballad,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Canibus, Canibus""
""Fuckin' with Canibus, fuckin' with Canibus""

I'm about eight thousand miles away from home
Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on
I just put an ad in The Source to cause a little controversy
Came from doing a concert out in Jersey last Thursday
A kid said Eminem wanted to hurt me
He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
His rhyme was very weak, I didn't know he had words for me
I bet he's probably never even heard of me
Ever since I met Stan, he took me kinda personally
It didn't even occur to me he was involved personally
With Stan earlier than me, now he's perturbed at me
I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me
And anytime that I'm ready that he's got a verse for me
Damn, I didn't know he was that thirsty for me
I guess he ain't the only emcee that's nervous of me
There ain't a person in the game with more courage than me
From France to Germany, they call me the merchant of beef
What you want, yo? Red or white meat?
Meet me in Petty, I'm with JRU and sightseeing
And man I got a nice feeling
I'm working on my fourth album and now that I think about it I've had a tight career
Haven't I made it quite clear? Lyrically I'll always be right here
And nobody can snatch my mic here
Rip the Jacker was a nightmare
Jack the Ripper truly reminds me of him and I don't really like that
What type of a life is that?
It's like Anthony Hopkins giving Norman Bates a nightcap
Damn, I can write raps, I'm good at it, ain't I?
Niggas call my name out, 'cause they want the mic back
But I raise the price so high that in fact
The market is collapsin', niggas don't know how to act
I guess the world's chaos is spinning over the raps
They make you sign a contract, and con you out of your tracks
Don't act like you don't know, Bis
The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit
I left you frozen stiff
With molten Aluminum and molded tip
I'll pierce a hole through a brick, you know I can Rip
Say give me five, I'll show you six quicker than you can blink
Probably quicker than you can think
As quick as ink drives, my rhymes are contagious like pink eye
The hypnotize you to dickride
I'm Illmatic like Nas and Stillmatic like Escobar
No, I'm not still at it with Todd
Don't blame me, it ain't my fault, it never was
Before I even knew him, I already had a buzz
But that was then, and this is now
Bis been ripping in down since the day he came out
See, I've been there, done that, I don't even have to make a comeback
I move over to France where the love's at
Become a bureaucrat and start cutbacks
Create a cure for AIDS with a device that connects to the nut sack
Capable of altering a man's blood pattern
Humanitarians will love that
I start a label with other acts, get a couple plaques
And completely cover the map before I come back
I wanna give Alicia Keys a kiss
Compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis
I'm an extremist, when I'm on some MC shit
And after this, you could never not believe in Bis
Terry Stone, UK clique, keeping it thick
Use my name, motherfuckers, when you speaking to Bis",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-ballad-lyrics
"4, 3, 2, 1 (Original Verse)",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Method, where the gods at? Redman, where the squad at?
Yo L, is that a mic on your arm? Let me borrow that
Who's the God of rap you saying is nice?
I'll beat a dead nigga to death and beat a dead nigga to life
If you look at me long enough, I'll start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough and then I'll call your bluff
Let's see how many rhymes you got
I can go on for more Millenias than Mazdas got in a car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I'll call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take them in all shapes, sizes, and forms, spit on
Any emcees who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to 60? I'm already doing a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it
Your head will spin so fast, you'll catch whiplash
I practice lyrical witchcraft on your bitch ass
Make your hard drive crash, the C colon backslash
And I'll go back to the booth to school your whack ass
Because the object of the game is to spark every cell in your brain
At degrees hotter than blue flames
Propane gasses, it incinerate you into ashes
I got you breathin' harder than girls in Lamaze classes
Stop bitchin' about if it's written or freestyle
Got the whole Spanish community saying I'm muy mal
Charging niggas with booty styles $50 fines
In addition to $25 for whack punchlines
’Cause I'm the top dog running the yard
And I represent cause I never chained to the fence
Hence to battle me is impossible
I'll put your whole crew in the hospital with IVs all in their nostrils
Stop sleeping on me, I ain't a mattress
Put you through more drama than a soap opera actress
Don't even think about pulling out and opening fire
Gunshots wound but I remove bullets with pliers
I aspire to kick the fattest that you've ever witnessed
From a far side, that's even confusing the fat lip
Rhymes designed from lines of pure knowledge
I'll make your head nod 'til your neck runs out of cartilage
I think it's obvious that I can bring the ruckus
Scream on your crew like a military drill instructor
When I come through, niggas stand stiller than statues
If I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew
Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd
And rip your fucking skin off just to get on your nerves",https://genius.com/Canibus-4-3-2-1-original-verse-lyrics
The Emerald Cypher,Lyrical Law,2011,"Niggas listen to this shit right now
Got this shit goin down
That New World Order, niggas is holdin it down
Niggas ain't ready man, everybody know what time it is man
Y'all niggas listenin to this shit right now
All my niggas in the street
Man y'all niggas know what time it is, are they ready?
Let's see it, let's see if these niggas is ready man

My brain is a coliseum unfinished, an art museum that none vision
A mausoleum before the Sun risen
Dark wisdom, break the order of the magic witches
The tablet that we gifted, fall in the hands of the music business
The sacred oath, the snakish popes
He flinches, I take his ghost
Shadow war, we battle for
The emerald ring that unfold wings
When you enter the temple they sing, hieroglyphs
Up a spiral cliff, follow the monk for months
Close your eyes when his disciples is sent
Every morn' the first satellite hit
I spit, the prayer laws recite from scripts
Then it's back to the silence
Patient observe the lotus bud, I write the scroll on each clove
This is discipline before beast mode
Follow G-O-D code
Fondle my prayers beads under a pear tree, this prepares me
Then a chair was formed by the bees
I bared the dare, come around me
I won't speak for weeks, I hold my tongue
Now I can hold the Sun - how is it I outnumber y'all?
And y'all got me by 6 to 1 (y'all got me by 6 to 1)

The Elohim hold court in the ether
Decidin the fate of the human race I plead my case through the speakers
Sun the rapper who mastered the dark matter
The God particle mass created to smash atoms
Deal with energies that vibrate at higher frequencies
Your chakra's gotta be in line to even speak to me
Journey through time and I doubt you'll ever find
A shine on minds like mine that dwarf Einstein
See I confuse Confucius, with a complex theory of evolution
With mind power that devoured Isaac Newton
Heaven on Earth? Nah! It's more like some sort of Hell
War with Satan ground shakin from the mortar shell
Escape the Matrix like Morpheus
Dodgin bullets in slow motion like we smokin some dust
But my third eye's bright enough to spar with the Dalai Lama
Verbal projectiles pierce spiritual body armor
I'ma, master builder from an enslaved mason
Tryna hide my true identity as my creation
Lines I scribed identify who I'm facin
It's war! And either you a God or a Satan
""Lyrical Law"" draws the paper thin line between love and hate
Decide if you destroy or create
They think it's verbal but this warfare is spiritual
We box 'em in, apply pressure to his physical
Check one two, who got more style than Sun do?
None do, solar flare your Earth duke, son you
I body the mic, I body the beat
I body the MC with the audacity to flow after me

My automated system got eight wicked concoctions
If that don't satisfy press nine for more options
(BOOOOP) I can't believe you just did that
Twenty thousand wigs just concurrently slid back
Ha~! I blow flames in hot dosages
If I get too thirsty the Earth'll be oceanless
Feelings don't move me, I guess I'm emotionless
Sick party host, piñata full of locustses
Bobbin for live grenades inside a bucket
I know the plural pronunciation is ""locust"" but fuck it
What are the percentages of a man actually choking to death
After swallowing phonetic images?
I spit unlimited pandemics, deliberately distributing
Millions of rappers skin grafts and can't spit it
As I child I would see and slay; they'd check my room
And find my imaginary friend's imaginary DNA
It's gutwrenching - my ultimate intention
Is to sit on top of The Tower of Infinite Ascension
K-Rino the agg' jackal who ravages natural
Like V in the alphabet I keep comin after you
The judge said for the sake of my health
I've been ordered to stay a hundred miles away from myself
You ain't hard! You a fake, I won't stop until I've blown his cover
You softer than the baby sister of a Jonas Brother

You ain't a behavioural scientist, why you dyin to spit?
You try too hard when you rhymin with 'Bis, try again
Approved this for public release, fuck with the beast
With bucked teeth bust your guns or get rushed in the streets
Handcuffed to the back of the Jeep, blindfolded
You hear a foreign language they speak, you do not know it
Kidnapped to Kemet through Khartoum to parched sand dunes
To a dark room, to witness your doom
Bash you in the face with the mag, rope around your neck
Over a tree branch, hoist you up with three sandbags
You shit yourself, your pants sag
Global broadcast, man that's sad, they lynched him in the lab
Twenty-four apprentices for hardcore fellowship
Twenty-four masters, twenty-four lyricists
Dead to the world, alive to the hearts that are pure
If you endure your mind's open doors
Complete the last step without crossin my rep
Who's next? What possessed you to jump off a cliff?
I spit darts, once you stop the Hip Hop juggernaut
Kill you bloodclot, you stink like jungle rot
Me llamo a Hermann Bushido Dogan Shotokan
The prototype of the first proto rhyme
With combined payloads, my glide bombs provide flows
That cause World War II death tolls at live shows
Independently targeted, bombin shit from so high up
In the atmosphere you lose consciousness
No oxygen, only Canibus antioxidants
Think about it, why spit into a bottomless pit?
I'm so isolated lyrically, they put me in a desert facility
To test my abilities, check out my melodies
Designed by Pratt & Whitney, rap so swiftly
TAW-50 following me cause you're with me
Your hot bars are lukewarm, let me school y'all
Intravenously cold blooded coolin coils are runnin through my jaws
The Sun's hot - I'm warmer; the metaphor explorer
I give a order, you can't cross the border!
We ain't religious, don't talk about the Torah
We'll crucify you on the cross for a quarter
Welcome to my House of Slaughter, signing on the roster
Go downstairs, put your stuff in the locker
And come back, let me see what you got son, I dropped him
Rappers steppin to me? I ain't the one
Spontaneous nucleonic you the opposite, be honest
You produce reduced knowledge, your discography is dishonest
Both promise, change your name to MC Silence
Yes, your album inspired me, no I didn't buy it
Talk back, nigga get fired
I'll erase your verse off the track so fast you'll wake up tired
Candles go out, darkness infiltrate the house
What the fuck he talkin 'bout? He got a mental case mouth
I forced him to his knees, told him to face South
Empty your PayPal bank account before I blow your brains out
Untouchable since the day I came out
That's why these wack niggas keep callin my name out
How the fuck they gon' change that now? How they sound?
I'ma put him in the ground, Lyrical Law style
How you liked at me then, how you liked me now
How you liked me in the future when I'm wearin that crown
The crown is invisible, you don't have to be a loud individual
You act like Hip Hop is all you listen to
If that's true, this is for you
Then I'ma keep rippin you, cause that's what Canibus do
If that's true, this is for you
And I'ma keep rippin you, cause that's what Canibus do",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-emerald-cypher-lyrics
Bis vs. Rip,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"The Ripper, *echoes*
Dear Boss
I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they won't fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track....

Yo, you fucking hate me, you fucking lock me in the basement
And you still want me to protect you, it doesn't make sense
Can-I-Bitch, I supported you like a weight bench
Without me you're defenceless you better face it
You ain't show me love when you was at your apex
Getting paychecks up at the radio with DMX and Flex
Catching wreck while Noreaga was catching his breath
I had to keep the situation in check
Look at the varicose veins in my neck, Germaine is the best
The industry fucked you, I'm just paying 'em back
What's the matter with slaying jackers? That's all I've been doing
Besides talking shit I ain't done nothing to 'em
They just mad cause when I see 'em I don't run up to 'em
Between me and you, yo you know I run right through 'em

Calm down

Who you telling to calm down nigga, I'm a ripper remember?
I told you not to do ""Gone Til November.""
But you wouldn't listen. I always had your best interests in mind
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
If it wasn't for me you'd be writing pitiful lines
On stage if you was tired, I was spitting sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
I would just be quiet, stand to the side and let that shit ride
But I'm getting tired of having to remind you Bis
If it wasn't for me nobody would've signed you Bis

What Rip?! Why you tripping, you know it's a crazy business
You a lying ass bitch and you know it
Group Home was part my company, I co-owned it
If its one thing I learned in show biz
Stay focused and don't quit Rip
Why you talking 'bout old shit?

Germaine, you fucking water brain
Don't you understand, fuck the mainstream
You should just call out names
The industry's all about game I shit on 'em all the same
 and I leave spit stains on their brain
Like liquid chocolate spilling over their new white trainers
Insane is an understatement, I'm Satan
Canibus is a Mason, I don't know what the fuck Germaine is
I just know that both of y'all are trying my patience
I don't give a fuck about a beat, I've been rhyming for ages
Rippers are dangerous, all jackers are afraid of us
You wanna face me Bis? Kick a rhyme!
(
That's ridiculous
), aight then, listen to mine
I jump in a costume impromptu just to rob you
Put the nozzle to your eye ball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Bury you next to shark fossils, make it impossible to find you
Depths that Jacques Cousteau himself wouldn't dare to dive to
With goggles, oxygen bottles and Doppler effect modules
Lock you in a time capsule, smash the console
Shit on you in reverse and suck you in a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
You're nothing but a coward in the cold freezer with a hour to go
Watching my Casio stop watch, counting it slow
Like drug lords checking to see if it's talcum or coke
I can kill you by drowning the globe
Or I can just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
In battles I'm a thousand & 0, I silenced the Pope
Do you know how many rhymes I've economically grossed?
No? I thought so, neither do I
Its a dick between your mother's thighs divided by pi
I'm the sickest linguistically, illicit lyrical misfit, in the business
And probably in existence. What's your consensus?
Study my own syntax statistics since '96 with CPA certified assistance
I made a decision that my standards are above precision
The only thing I can honestly say I love more than women are dope writtens
If it ain't dope then don't spit it
Don't be sensitive and get on the defensive, just practice your penmanship
If you can't spit at high temperatures then just quit
Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left
According to manufacture's specs you'll make a mess
And rupture the blood vessels in your neck fucking with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disk
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversion kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
You never experienced work like this, Bitch!
Welcome to the serpentine world where I spit
The world where I twist, the world that I rip, the world where I live

Okay Rip you made your point, I can't out-rap you
You said you was the illest, I would never doubt that too
A lot of these rappers is jealous that's why they attack you
They think you the best, that's why they wanna battle you
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
You are the illest alive, that's a fact that you proved
Just a couple rappers don't want it to happen for you
Ragging on you like battling is all you can do
You didn't sell enough units to be honest with you
Nobody knows the truth, you got talent out the gazoo
When niggas first heard you it was like ""Man on the Moon""
You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too
So what if the ladies think he's more handsome than you
What happens if the rumours about being a faggot are true?
Look what it's running into
I don't feel like having this discussion with you, I'm tired of fucking with you
Niggas in the game don't wanna do nothing with you
Bussing with you, going one on one with who?
They wanna get rid of you. Shit is too lyrical
Headhunters out to get you. That's why I had to protect you
I wouldn't disrespect you as another intellectual
Without you I'm unsuccessful, God bless you
What makes you think I left you or why I'd ever be tempted to?
Ever since my third album I've been mentioning you
I got your name on my arm, I'm representing you
You Rip the Jacker. I would never question you
I respect your opinion as a professional nigga
I just want you to listen to what I'm telling you
What happened between L and you, forget it
People know you won the battle, they won't give you the credit
A lot of people don't want to admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to your lyrics
And be involved in sharing the merits, I'm forever indebted
I just need you to chill for a second
So I can send a positive message like 2Pac before he left us
The author of the work ethic Genesis
Has inspired me to write the ExeBis scripts as a constant reminder not to forget Bis
But I've reached a precipice
, remember Rip
You can't rhyme forever, there's always somebody with better shit
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
You're a commodity Rip, ain't that how you wanna keep it?
I keep your whereabouts secret
I bring bitches to the crib every weekend so why is you beefing?

Aiyo, stop patronizing me, you despise me
All you wanna do is steal rhymes from me
You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fucking zombie
If I was a priority, you'd acknowledge me
You ain't shit neither, you ain't got no college degree
You can't rhyme without me, stop smiling at me
Give me the keys to the garage, I need to borrow the Jeep
Get the fuck out my face, Bis",https://genius.com/Canibus-bis-vs-rip-lyrics
Poet Laureate Infinity V004,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"""And this is where the, the uh complexity comes in
Maybe we in modern uh civilization haven't really connected with this
Understanding""

This is never been done before with a rhyme outside the realm of time
It's the first of its kind
POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!!!
I procured a small piece of the treasure
Collections from a former era datin' back to forever
The warrior became protector; take a closer look at the bars
You'll see I'm not behind them or in front of them, I'm one of them
Started with a hundred, The Game spit three I said ""Fuck It!""
I'm a have to show these niggas somethin'
33 is the number that enlightens the Brother
Insight to the fullest that could brighten the dullest
The ramifications are awesome, what should we call it? Mortars
I drive forward Sandstorms make my eyes water
Skull is a submarine hull
Dolphin phones screen calls from places as far away as A.G.C.R
The rhymes are raw, protected by the Jericho wall
With surface permutation of the permafrost
We thought close support from the Navy Carriers and Air Force
Would give us all what we needed, we were wrong
This is ""The Greatest Rhyme of All Time"" supposedly
1000 Bars it will probably always be
The results from SETI, very interestin'
I briefed the committee they told me to stop the testin'
You cannot contend with this when I let it rip
Eyes, ears, nose and throat specialist Professor Bis
The sublime Chakra one thru nine
Thru the spine induce the rhyme
Internal fire produces the high
I listened to 44 4's 22 times
+I Gave You Power+ God stop my heart if I'm lyin'
SHUT THE FUCK UP and stop whinin'
Instinct controls how you think before decidin', so keep vibin'
The Art of Rhyming; I've mastered it certainly
Surely I'll celebrate capturin' it for my Taxidermy
From the streets of New Jersey to Germany
To jungles in Angola where most the meat poachers heard of me
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Under an assumed Identity I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
USA made, field grade steel face
Movin' at a Canibus pace in the proto subspace
Nobody could hold me back, my flow bloviates into a spiritual shape
And co-create rap, cold callous chronic chemical imbalance
Smokin' a chalice in the Rabbit hole with Alice
Systematic Global Geographic Systemic Neo-synopsis
Reload the graphics notice I spit it rapid
Victory over injury a victim to misery
The myriad of my metaphors make me a mystical mystery
They can't battle me; so they'd rather embarrass me
By being mad at me, they commit microphone heresy
Clairvoyant Technique, usin' X-Ray refraction
Not only can you see into the future, see past it
But I don't know what it means
I pass the DataStream along to my team
They say it's more than a dream
Kill you with weed vapour, then the Taser, then the Laser, then the Maser
Then somethin' they call Scalar
""That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die""
Why? Coupe de Grace for the Coupe d' Etat
In a man made lodge, the Moon Rays replace God
What ought to crawl has learned to walk
I have mastered The Art of Rhyming now I am so bored
I seen a mushroom to the north, from a porch
It was odd, every dog in the neighborhood barked
Cause Emotion manifests Thought, Thought manifests Words Actions and
Reality
But what is attracting me?
If you question me, you will be detained indefinitely
Your name will be added to the Black List Registry
Observe the man with the microphone strand
Or 5th or 6th, cause way more advanced
I look up in the sky to see if God is judging me
Suddenly I feel Fatima and Medjugorje come to me
Sittin' down at the mixin' board comfortably
They begin to study me, by showin' me worlds I would love to see
A stationary pulley drawin' from a wishin' well
The Genie gave me three more because I listen well
There's a Proverb that goes ""One should know thyself""
Before one can know the world so I showed myself
Metaphoric Sun Worship, pullin' me like planet inertias
But on the other hand these rappers are worthless
Rap Music Profession, Immuno suppressants
One question per second, one answer per session
You lazy and you wanna be the best? You crazy!
Poet Laureate is reserved for the name G
My lyricism amplifies every letter written
+Rip the Jacker+ spittin' inside a Zero Vector System
Murder murder murder, kill kill kill drills
Williams was real ill, but now I chill
Fuck a record deal; my trainin' is real
Look at the sword I wield, you will taste my steel
Lyrical Fitness is no secret of course
But the secret to creativity, hidin' your sources
Preserve the sanctity of the Soldiers in IRAQ
Do not blame them, I hold their humanity hostage
I gotta spit 'til the story is told
It's a gift; this story is a part of my soul
We shouldn't keep fightin', the Earth is our home
If we destroy Mother Earth, then where will we go?
Are you food for the Moon? Or are you in the mood for doom?
Furniture moves when I walk into a room
Fuckin' bummer, no armour inside the Hummer
Gotta hug a motherfuckin' Sandbag for cover
I ride on a flatbed chariot, four ostriches carry it
I'm Big Billy Bob Black Angus
From the gutter to the gallows no media coverage
Cause I don't want it, that's why I'm rarely seen in public
If I were you I wouldn't waste time readin' rubbish
It might turn you into a media puppet, NIGGA LOVER!!!
All cultures come from One Mind
The Universe is not far behind, Waves Bars and Rhymes
Metaphor and Rhyme is poetry by design
But poetry continues outside the timeline
Don't care if I make history, I wanna be a part of INFINITY
You lied to us all in your speech
Symbiotic indeed, the host bleeds
Parasites attach to feed fulfilling antiquated needs
Over The Horizon Radar Rhymes
Patent number 4686605
I've apologized but I can't change who I am
Tried to change the future, can't budge the past
Beautiful longitudinal, musical lyrics
Fragments of Olympian Gossip, that is my vision
If A is a success in life
Then A must equal X plus Y plus Z no doubt
If work equals X and play equals Y
Then Z must be equal to you shuttin' your mouth
Agonizing, the pain of the migraine bitin' my brain
And everything inside it, I can't explain but I am tryin'
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
To the magnetic, ultra, electro, and uncensored resonance
I need to be alone, you cannot comfort me like my poems
THINK SO? You're a talk-show ho
The grown up who showed up drunk with his own cup stoned as fuck
Who can tell me that this poem is luck?
Does it amaze me? ""NO!"" Does it faze me? Maybe a little yo
Gotta find a way to generate dough
The minerals where they grow determine the stability of the flow
I might get drunk and boast
Williams you gotta go first
""If you say so, HALO"", High Altitude always stay low
I approached the podium, and delivered my encomium
Nobody applauded the atmosphere was ominous
They feared I would spit, they don't like when I bust
I need more pain so I can pretend to be tough
1000 Bar race at an unrelentin' pace
Just in case Humans ever get to World War VIII
Food supply low, they speak of goin' above ground to find mo'
I cry out ""NO - DO NOT GO!!!""
The window is closin', from the other side it looks like it's openin'
Where am I tryna to go with this?
Only the chosen, find a way out
Everybody move out! Make sure to stay off the main route
Arctic Geography is conducive to Astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies, follow me
A good Psychological environment for science
I'm memorizing and visualizing peace and quiet
Comparative image sharpness between artists
I don't think you know what you're about to get involved in
This is my unacknowledged special access project
Time reversed waves in nonlinear optics
Tunnel borin' and jackin', water main tappin'
I sat there draftin' a new drainage plan laughin'
Scientifically Quantifiable megalomaniacal
Viable style, it's like tryna to ride a Bull
The lyrical anaemical is miserable because I've built a citadel
Of syllables that made me invincible
Creatively I have never been to this level
First I'll put you in a sideways 8, then a pretzel
Burn skin off face, burn face off skeletal plate
Plasma Ray Gun is just one explanation
Man Made Membrane roofin' remediation
Any and All entry points have immigration
She asked me if I was followed, I told her I wasn't
I didn't know the spy that sold me out would be my own cousin
""Populace uniformed is a populace of slaves""
Washington didn't say it quite that way
Musically still producin', I got a couple new things cocoonin'
But Poet Laureate is my New Shit!
Pulsating Lights and Sounds surrounds spirits
Binaural Beats, layered underneath lyrics
250 thousand cycles per second, for Dolphin hearin'
The Electrical Optical Coupling Gear is effective
I've almost perfected this
I'm one word away from excellence
When I find it I'll begin testin' it
My pupil size increase, constriction and velocity decrease
You can't Emcee take a seat
Wilder than the wilderness, I'm 'bout to show you who wildebeest Williams is
You better be filming this
I proof read my writtens, eat a chicken with the skin missin'
Spend the whole night out binge drinkin'
I rip shit consistent, spit persistent
The sickness, spit with conviction, promote lyrical fitness
I'm lost, which version is this? Mozart
With a flowchart puttin' together parts of an unknown art
Rhymes compartmentalized, separatized to prevent bootleg Pirates
Be my guest keep tryin'
I'm hooked on Hip-Hop, I can't live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I don't doubt it
The Visionary Cell designed my new Lab
Paul Laffoley engineered a magnificent draft
You said ""the best shouldn't ask for respect""
Is that correct? Yes, could you please speak up, I SAID YES!
That's not possible, that's sounds completely illogical
You must've been kicked the fuck out of school
You cannot fold under the political pressure
You gotta take prudent and precautionary measures
Four and a half foot beings with big black eyes
Tried to trap me and extract my rhymes, all the time
A Luciferian web, everyday we are buryin' dead
Every color in America bled; this is Empirical evidence
Of the greatest collection of Canibus sentences
You'll never reach the end of it
Fire for effect, smoke out then rest
Give me a wedge formation, roll out like this
I will spare no sin, walk in with a scarecrow grin
Of nothin' on this Planet can dissuade this
They left me dehydrated by the Nile River naked but I made it
With passion of a Microphone Patriot
I did it for my Fathers; I did it for my Mothers and my Brothers
I did it for the world to discover
The head of a Lion, the legs of an Eagle
The wings of a Dragon, and to the people
I hope the words reach you
There is strength in numbers, there is numbers in strength
The ink, I bow before the desert wall of the Sphinx
Into the bottomless pool of Poetry I plunge
1000 Bars from the real Iron Lungs
Everybody bow your heads, say this prayer
From this moment HIP-HOP IS UNITED EVERYWHERE
POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!!!
POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!
POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!
POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!

M-Sea-Cresy,Rip the Jacker,2003,"""Those who create literature know first-hand
Just how difficult creating music can be...""
""..There are no options now..""
""...If I weren't a writer, I think I'd be a total psychological mess""

Out of the Umbilicus Mundi, this is lyrical lunacy
From a human being to speak so fluently
Bars of poetry without precedence
Complete par excellence, listen to the Levitibus Testament
To understand me you need help
You gotta see the film ""The Day After Trinity"" written by John Else
To understand that, you must know thyself
You should keep listening cause Canibus flow might help

""...But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps""
""...other's say they're bad, but they're buggin'""
""...Never that, I'm constantly comin with clever raps""
""...Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict""
""...I'm not an emcee who talkin all that junk""
""...Please, a lot of suckas would like to forget me but""
""...The incredible, lyrical, and original""
""...I grab the steel with the chrome on top""

To find the answers that we didn't know, maybe Edgar Allan Poe's
Description of El Dorado is not so
See the reason there's no light at the end of tunnel
Is cause we're really not in a tunnel, we're trapped in a bubble
The government hierarchy and the dregs of society
Can you explain why you believe hell is fiery?
We're suffering from symptoms of drapetomania
Slavery isnt over, it just took a new alias
The data repository established for the maintenance
Almost turned me into an atheist scared of aliens
Why write lyrics when I make a better livin
Sellin freeze dried venom to wildlife clinics?
Cause I hate the thought of bein a predictable bore
Once you get used to me you won't love me no more
The final soliloquy of the internal paramour
What are we all to do when rap music is gone?
I hope God and the imagination are one
A golden tongue can achieve synchronicity with the sun
Transcended beyond the flesh and the blood
Cause this is level one, after this album my message is done

""...But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps
...other's say they're bad, but they're buggin'
...Never that, I'm constantly comin with clever raps
...Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict
...I'm not an emcee who talkin all that junk
...Please, a lot of suckas would like to forget me but
...The incredible, lyrical, and original
...I grab the steel with the chrome on top""

But you can't battle me, so you'd rather embarrass me
I maintain dignity in the face of calamity
They reach out their hand to me and talk dishonestly
But I read through their syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky
A student so overzealous I motivate my trainers
I'd rather get some now then get some later
Take a break from writin rhymes on paper, recondition my character
Change my nature with seven days of Vipassana
Let go of the stress, man I was deeply depressed
So famished in fact, I needed a rest
To regenerate my mind
Bless the cornerstone of my rhyme with corn oil and wine
Then see the light, an illuminous paradigm
It became more apparent with time
All I had to do was follow the signs
To be a better man, I need help
I've just got to find the link between my inner deity and myself

""...But you said keep quiet while the emcee raps
...other's say they're bad, but they're buggin'
...Never that, I'm constantly comin with clever raps
...Strung off the rhyme time like a cocaine addict

""People are usually terrified of poetry
And they don't realize that its just speech
It is language that is sometimes extraordinary
But there are ways to deal with it without worrying about it the way they do""",https://genius.com/Canibus-m-sea-cresy-lyrics
Poet Laureate,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"Yo, Houston to Earth, watch the Ripper crucify you with verse
My urethra to ya uvula quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapon search
Strap a bomb to one of your labels record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Ring the alarm, red alert, nigga it gets worse
Bypass security networks with select words
Megahertz make nebulas reverse till your head burst
Call the press first and ask them who got the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
If you are what you eat, it's obvious I can't eat what I'm worth
Y'all niggas eat pussy and burp
The other half of y'all suck dick till your jaws and ya neck hurt
When you address me nigga end your sentence with, ""Sir""
Critics went berserk they ain't even heard my best work
See I broke into the mind by
Quietly going by their eardrum walls and hotwired they skulls
Yeah I earned the name Canibus, but what did it cost?
Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore
Niggas probably like, what the fuck he dissing him for?
Yeah he dissed me first but you was never informed
I'm one of the top five nigga, my shit is tight nigga
You heard it right nigga, I rock mics nigga
But the limelight isn't where I belong
The top four don't even look in the mirror no more
If they did I'd be in the mirror looking back at 'em
Ready to grab them, kidnap them and put them on my album
I rip jackers, Rip the time/space fabric
Loop the future with the past tense looking for patterns
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
And forced black men to pay taxes
Attack a wack bitch with counter tactics
Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling
Keep firing at you till you trapped in
Non-combatants scramble for helicopter extraction
While I'm back at Fort Bragg bragging
How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with Rip the Jacker daggers
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate to characters one by one like Arafat tarot cards suggest
I make terrorist threats through your stereo sets
Various anthrax carriers sending sarin to the press
With an imaginary address, Cani's the best
Untraceable, your pictures unpaintable, canvas that's wet
Let me dry you off wit some of this fire I spit
26 years old nigga look how I spit
A microphone fiend since I was like 14
My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine, OK?
I'm reloaded, you fucking wit the wrong MC
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease to the whole industry
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars ain't impressive to me
You stepping to me nigga do it intelligently
You wanna battle or you wanna fucking wrestle wit me
You ain't better than me, you just got an obsession wit me
Canibus hybrid, the cake icing of rhymeness
As I grow older I get colder like the declining climate
Of earth's environment, I'm entirely tireless
Rhymes come from my higherness of wireless dialect
Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs
Astrally project during heightened sex, chakras connect
Doctors inspect what they can't possibly interpret yet
That's why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They like immature earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Lyrically I step on you, rip on you
Then I defecate what I just digested on you
I'm better than you, I'm better than you, I'm better than you
Just to get the chequered flag I'll put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you write a motherfucking letter to you
And your editors too, threatening you
Detective check your mail and your messages too
You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever with you
I'm a rap music mutant with a cool name
Misconstrue fame, but I spit butane
Blue flames out giant CO2 tanks
Demagnetize memory banks, enhanced, advanced
One of a kind like modern man's retina scans
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
What you want me to break first? Your jaw or your grill?
What type of spit you want from me? Sparkling or still?
Study law, Yale draw up my own deals
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread the ganglia from Tanzania
To the flats of East Anglia, give up, you can't keep up
The man eater in a wife beater
Spreading Typhoid Fever through mic receivers with light reverb
Type in the right keywords, I might emerge
Takes a really nice nigga to incite these nerds
Niggas wanna see the gully in me, keep fucking with me
Never under pressure, I keep the pressure under me
Burn the weed
Drop a freestyle on the internet then watch niggas burn the CD
Upload a picture of your mum getting DP'd
I'm one size away from 13, believe it she peed
I'm the illest and its gonna be that way forever
Word of mouth is good but a mouth of words is better nigga
No body gets sicker than the Ripper",https://genius.com/Canibus-poet-laureate-lyrics

POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!!!
Nobody do it better, there ain't a truer Ripper
I did this separate imagine what we could do together
Inspired by GOD, inspired by the sufferin'
Was it done by a prophet? - it must have been
Who was it then? +Rip the Jacker+
Hot but cold blooded, many utter the name but very few love him
Other emcees be nervous or somethin'
Rhymes in abundance, Hip-Hop Justice
Rappers are captured and punished
The Polar Manitoba's melted by lava
A team of ER doctors climbed aboard the chopper
My skull is a submarine hull
I empty the ballast tanks I could smell the shit from the sea gulls
My mind dives deep beneath yours
Poseidon Trident Seahorse bubbles form I scream with extreme force
Marinari's Trench detour to Ultima Thule
Let me explain what my sonar saw
This is the greatest rhyme of all time supposedly
Through a term I'd like to call ""Pulse Detonation Poetry""
Industrialists, civilians women and children directly
Military chiefs, aristocrats in buildings
Membership is based off your raw intelligence
400 screen video editing with hard evidence
Imagine being fined over a rhyme for steppin' over the line?
When I inspired Hova and Nas
Recite 33 3's 33 times
For 24 hours, 21 thousand Nautical miles
Don't be upset with Canibus yet, the kids just want respect
You been a success but what do he get?
Devine design, a miracle of Metallurgy
Every clergy member from Mecca who heard of me worshipped me
I got away nervously, talked about it purposefully
Next time I see it, it's gonna have a word with me
The Biological Chemical emergency
I purchase the beat; I resumed PsyOps on the enemy
Mix the blood so it don't coagulate
The sex magic won't work if the bitch masturbates
Nobody can hold me back, my flow bloviates into a spiritual shape
A capsule in Space, no emcee could rhyme like this, there's no challenge
His Poet Laureate should pontificates balance
Telencephalon olfactory lobes I had to practice
When a woman has her period I smell it on the mattress
Advanced Step In Innovative Mobility
Most emcees try to clone me lyrically
They can't battle me so they'd rather embarrass me
But I need a volunteer, do I have any?
The NASA contractor with a satchel of answers
I passed up the Nobel Peace Prize for my passion
Most of you will never understand what I mean
My dreams are broken into storyboard scenes
Kill you with green Lasers, evaporated weed vapour
Electromagnetic Scalar then somethin' they call a Maser
""That is not dead which can eternally lie
And with strange aeons even death may die""
The leaders lies got me reassigned, my loyalty was redefined
They will not be allowed to see the rhymes
In a town near Kadam and Kakrak Jalalabad
I pray in a hut constructed from Sago Palm
I'mma take you for a walk thru a beau
tiful place called Honey Swamp
We'll shoot hoops at Mosquito Lagoon Park
Emotion manifest Thought
Thought manifest Words Actions and Reality
That's how it has to be
The overseer of poetic antiquities
Victoria and Albert Museum kept them for me
Inject the gas into the centrifuge mass
The Teleological Dynamic will enhance
I remove the veil from in front of me
Suddenly, truly, there is too much to see
The Law of Attraction is attracted to me
The Laws of Poetry in action is practiced quite actively
My body did not melt beyond the Van Allen Belt
I was transformed into a spirit with no shell
I'm modifying the weather from behind a weather shield
Writing with a feathered quill, gettin' more ill
I hope I am not alone, that would be terrible
If I am celebrating and that'd be a miracle
At least for my interconnected introspective perspective
The more pretentious, the more apprehensive the sentence
Hip-Hop made me, Hip-Hop praise me
Ain't nothin' changed me since 1980
Involuntary catalepsy, BATTLE ME BABY!!!
1000 BARS NIGGA!!!, Zero Vector System
Brain waves reveal High Yield E&D Fields
Chew emcees like I'm eatin' a meal
Normal life is not real; we are just cogs in a wheel
We work, we hurt, we search, we feel
The microphonist that utilizes the study of Conics
Circular motion in both the Para and the hyperbolas
Mad Max beyond Thunderdome under Red Rock
It's no use if you can't use what you got
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si-Do
These are the tones that will activate your ohms
Who have lost their faith, who have lost their hope
Who have lost their point, who have lost their own
Are you food for the moon? The potion is you
Just in case you try to poison my food but I want you to
Rap music and those who listen to it don't owe me nothin'
I don't want nothin' from you, not even your judgement
I ride on a flatbed chariot, four Ostriches carry it
I control their movements with lariats
Polygraphs flutter, the Love Craft, Craft Lover
I don't want it, that's why I'm rarely seen in public
If I were you I wouldn't waste time readin' rubbish
I don't care what you say nigga, you're a nigga lover
The relative radiance of the rhyme makes it shine
Increase the star wattage with longer cycle time
How's my driving? Run you off the road smiling
1-800 Road Rage, Start dialing
Don't care if I make history, I wanna be a part of INFINITY
Look at what your SUN GOD did to me
I submit to the will of the creator willingly
The possibilities present a probable infinity
I climbed the slope shaped like a stop sign in record clock time
Hot Lava lock rhymes, rock slide topside
At the Observatory summit of Mount Graham
Lookin' through the starlight scope in my hand
Creative writing and rhythm, grammar and composition
Don't ignore me, ignore the fool who tell you don't listen
Strivin' my principle findings by designing a new style of rhyming
That you could take home and try out
A 100 Bars per hour, sometimes I doubled the writing
Secret signature time equals the hardest part to figure out
Poetically Paralyzing, Where Are You? Are you hiding?
No! I am Sandbag diving?
From the Kinetic to the Energetic
St. Germaine was made to explain the lesson with a 1000 bar message
Straight out the freak show no pre show
Limited oxygen when I rhyme fast you breathe slow
The Pope shook; they ransacked Rome and burnt books
I ran back home to hide mine in the woods
MOSES is a new weapon system secret code
CONUS
 is the continent of the US, I suppose
I don't have all the answers I am not in the know
I can only see what is above and only from below
Substratum of reality through the thick cloud canopy
How can it be Canibus? Answer me!
My shelter is not far, you can borrow what you need
The bunker doors sequestered beneath the tall tumble trees
Gold chords from the organ cut down your swordsman
Tell everybody to SHUT THE FUCK UP when I'm talkin'
From a very cold place called Faraday Base
Right next to the South Poles longest Ice Strait
My dream was identical seven nights in a row
I saw a sideways 8 wrapped around a microphone
Extraterrestrial Isotopic ratios
A broke Scientist in his Lab with no place to go
Fire and Ash fallout, that's what it's all about
We must construct a shelter then build a wall around it
Geography is conducive to Astronomy
And the study of celestial bodies, biopsy
My austere designs are so ahead of their time
Even when you press rewind you're still left behind
I blasted thru the limestone with water, mixed with a dissolver
Then I signaled the remaining cave crawlers
Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, battle the hardest
Take out Hip-Hop trash and garbage
On the Sabbath I write preplanning for the Planet
Drawin' mechanics, suspended in space as holographic
The Quarantine Isolation Unit is where I house it
My team and I salvage the work of Dr. Fritz Albert
Hip-Hop is blackened pot placed next to a kettle
With my logo in it, a rigid rehomogenized metal
Greetings and Salutations, my equations are inundated with information
Electro Cranial Stimulation
Password please? Have patience, verification
I repeat, ""What's Your Character String Verification?""
Battle rap is just aimless entertainment
+2nd round K.O.+ was one of they favourites, fuck all the haters
Responsibility entrusted
There's only one way for me to prove that I love it
That's why I'm bustin'
I turned the page, wrote a turn of phrase
Verbal X-Rays, they say ""I don't burn I blaze""
Attach the piezoelectric transducer to your computer
Poet Laureate is the future!!!
Next time we meet this whole song will be a new mix
For all the Rippers out there who need a new fix
With these lyrics, I consecrate the spirit
Whenever I spit it, concentrate you could hear it
I've almost perfected this
I'm one word away from excellence
Cyclotronic Resonance, patents are pendin' it
Can-I-Bus a/k/a ""The Spitzberg Beast""
Gave his Bicentennial Speech on Emerald Peak
What are you building Bis? Is it a flyin' Silver Disk?
GW I'm positive it's him
I proof read my writtens, eat a chicken with the skin missin' in 10 minutes
Now that's some shit! You think that's fast? Nah
That's faster than you think, by the time you blink, the whole Universe
Shrinks
We'll observe the Gods, my thoughts graduated to the Stars to infinity
Listen to the bars, thick rhymes compartmentalized
Seperatized to prevent bootleg pirates gives me energy when I'm tired
I'm hooked on Hip-Hop, I can't live without it
You can mix this song a thousand ways I don't doubt it
Several million years into the past
The primitive future in a world without oil and gas
Gather the evidence then give it to the President
Don't reprimand him, ask him for help next
I hold Hip-Hop responsible
Every magazine writer that wrote bullshit in his article
Always remember I'll be gone forever
I made these bars so you could all remember
The rhymes in my mind when I autograph sign
I can't wait to sign an autograph for the last time
The ungrateful dead reoccurring images playin' in my head
Every color in America bled
Canibus grabbed the mic like an energized amulet
Then spit a rap that you can't forget
""With this sacred water --
I consecrate this Talisman so that it will make me POET LAUREATE""
This is a no brainer, stop the complainin'
If Hip-Hop was dead I came here to save it
Classified payloads, no frequency safe modes, no safety
And I still made time for the ladies
No corruption, no disruption, no destruction, no budget, no nothin'
It's never that easy you just gotta trust it
The spin off from the Press should be able to feed you
But I declined, cause I'm familiar what greed can do
I sit down and think, when I write I can smell the ink
It's the dark skinned Lizard King
Metronome Man will never take commands from the drum
The beat is my slave and it will behave as I want
I heard Hip-Hop was dead, that's not fair
Who I talk to? 
""Go he there, Nasir""
YEA, POET LAUREATE INFINITY!!!
I WILL FOREVER BE THE ILLEST LYRICALLY!!!

Rip vs. Poet Laureate,Lyrical Law,2011,"You have proved your valor yet again
Let us hope for the last time
(But there's no one left to fight, sire)
There is always somebody left to fight

Are you an ego monster, writing ten thousand bars?
I'll melt your squid face with ten thousand stars
Your battle raps dried up like the ass of the Sphinx
And your brains fried up my verses make your ball shrink
I'll kill you like Marie Curie with Ionizing Radiation
You are facing termination by your own creation
My metaphors mechanics will toss you off the planet
You smoke too much chronic, my vocab is volcanic
Infinite beings with black bars, that eat through rap stars
Travel time in fast cars, you fire past Mars
I ran back home to battle Rip on the phone
Right after I cracked Can-I-Bitch with the Mayan Sun Stone
You say we'll live without fear for several millions years
If you hold hands with your peers like a bunch of queers
My Stryker Brigade driver, strike a gay rapper
I leave Rip dehydrated with lines of hot lava
I tie you up with a snake shaped like a sideways eight
And watch you break and suffocate at an unrelenting pace
Mechanical skeletal structure was designed with a Heavy Mental
Your mind's left behind, it's as light as a feathered quill
The Will of Knowledge God controls thoughts and movement
And force Can-I-Bitch to eat atomic waste pollutant
LL crucified your career with 'The Ripper Strikes Back'
I slice you from ear to ear, who's the Jamaican in the body bag?

Rip the Jacker quantum creator, the quasar quaker
So many layers I can't demonstrate it on paper
My melodic emulators cut you down with trachea lasers
Of deeply deposited argon vapors
My every verse is a psychic institutional burst
I choose which layer to listen to first
At the peak of the Bell Curve, earthquakes make me misspell words
But loud and clear my every verse is well heard
They barely understand you
The unseen hands that sample you and command you, it's quite puritanical
Henry Louis Gates Jr. said I was a lyrical computer
A great leader of a spiritual movement
Homo Noeticus student, the cosmic human
Homo Evolutis, divine rulers from a digital future
I'm a poet not a puppet, I spit these rhymes without a budget
With more infinite rhymes than cousins
Non-periodic comets, halotolonian bubbles in solidified rock deposits
When you take the time to unearth what I did
You will witness infinity, every verse is a bridge
Uneasy lies the head, my crown is too heavy for your men
The mixing board got a thousand channels plugged in
Music generated user generated mixing board entertainment
For you mental entrainment

You rhyme, til the meter says 9, 9, 9, 9
I rhyme in a straight same line until the last trickle of time
I know that seems wrong but my conscience is long
Begone but silly, call me tongue rippin'
But Ripper's got his own song
You could never hold me back, Dr. Frankenstein's monster
I'm so abundant so my story Rip the Jacker is not redundant
True Hollywood Story, I battle for the glory
I will become the final chapter, a Canibus allegory
I made a name killing jackers and washed up rappers
I don't care if you pull the trigger on the wounded
Mr. Mathers have you had enough yet? (check!)
The devil creates that, probably the best yet
But tell the Infinite Laureate
Couldn't even work the con solo, your own time machine
100 years early when you exploded onto the scene
The tattoo on your arm now belongs to me
I will inscribe it with the words Laureate Infinity

The mic on my arm is symbolic for a knowledge bomb
Celestial arms spiral into viral columns
I was betrayed the moment you were born
And more often than not I say it in my songs
All day long I talk about Lyrical Law
I reserve the right to say whatever I want
If God kisses your face and the Devil kissed your ass
Then how come you ain't got no goddamn cash?
The breakaway civilization, generation on blast
The human population is reduced to ten percent of the half
For those who love to laugh
Bolides collide with incoming craft
The geography is nanoscopic nano-typography
If you don't understand don't mock me
The midnight lyricist with a one thousand bar cylinders
A Ripper's lyricism is unlimited

Laureate Infinity
Was the freestyle nigga that's me live
And for that you've gotta spend time on the green line
I destroy a whole city block, then , hey a sturdy cock
Finger touches on the flintlock
Make sure they put you in the dock
Turn your back on your  fans
With Hip Hop for Sale
And so it became a total fail searching for the Holy Grail
I possess  with the rhyme control
I profess that it is my fate to swallow your soul whole
When you need a new fix you use an Infinity mix
And never give me the credit
I feel degraded and sick
I am the hip hop God inside and Iron-Man suit
Rhymes ricochet back bounce back
End up killing your own troops
Gettin' tired of having to spend time with you
Rip you gotta go first Rip
You will become my mad bitch
2007 to infinity,  on my enemy
I will forever be the illest lyrically

The opening mechanism for the Sphinx is behind the ears
But there is freedom behind your fears
I am the autistic King Ellipsis who broke the Ecliptic
But don't nobody wanna listen
After twelve I turned into a Rakim gremlin
Bear witness to my lyrical fitness
Paranoid chilling Bob Dylan, Hip Hop villain
Lyrical Law from the heart of the Dark Lizard King still spitting
Kill a gilla reptile with poisonous venom
Give'em a pulmonary embolism when the rhythm hit 'em
Bus 'em, punishes women and children, whoever wit' 'em
The illest alive, still living, still spitting
The audio master, blast you with a vocal sample trigger
I'm the illest, I'm the illest, I'm the illest
They got their plans and we got ours
Plus I got my own plans if something goes sour

Got cut by other emcees for 
Got kicked the fuck off Universal
For smoking Ecstasy Purple
Rip the Jacker you are crazy
Williams is just lazy
Battle you 10 times on the same day
'cause you never did amaze me
You got the parallel action, write lyrics
Parallel 
Because your brain doesn't function
Since the night in the Rockies
With the military function
Producin' bars
Of percision, incredible 
Follow your  and intuition to finish the last mission
Buried on Mars 4 hours after spittin' your last bars
Your spirit becomes infinite lyrics to the stars
If your face can melt
Fuck Rip the Jacker, I appear courtesy of myself
From the North to the South, Seond Round Knock Out easy

Fast acting bio hazard, my verse is a surface burst
Blasting and attacking and backtracking through a massive magnet
Global area with a bio location for rappers
Vocals powered by zero point magic motors
How many times you done this before Bis?
Created an album that some love but others dismiss
My heir-apparent is trying to hijack Hip Hop
Using some fucked up mixing board spirits
Everything I've written for my brothers and sisters who still listen
This ain't no fricking fake reality vision
This a real mission, the real wheels of steel still spinning
I laugh, radio DJs ass kissing
How far would you go to be a rapper? Ask 'em
Beyond the absence of light is only blackness
How far would you go to be a rapper? Ask 'em
Beyond the absence of light is all blackness

I'm cancerous
So when I diss you wouldn't want to answer this
I could bust Eminem in a minute
But you ain't shit Canibus
If you mastered the final lesson
I could be your secret weapon blasting whoever's testing
In less than a half second
Killing bars by visionary lyricists
With a light saber channeling raw visuals forever digital
Darth Vader, Rip the Jacker's archnemesis
Specialist geneticist put you in a labyrinth
Then send them transcripts to Genesis
I said I said the best shouldn't have to take a breath
That's correct, yes you can't ever pass the test
The most powerful in the booth harness the power of PLOO
I can't rest until I decapitate a body
And prove you've taken a break for water
Is my signal to start slaughter
Creating heavenly ordered
With swords from border to border
Rip the Jacker is living off his speed
I kill rappers battle the last jackers
Feed on bloody, cold cadavers

Two hundred bars, eleven minutes, eighteen bars per minute
Yeah, I still got it, can you fuck with it?
Superior rhymes, recorded in sidereal time
Uncontrived and alive by design
Tiger tooth Spiderman diving off the roof
Smile, it's the truth when I'm rhyming over loops
I'm in a spaceship minus the roof
Yeah, a real spaceship, something I designed in my youth
Let the world know the truth
That I designed iller records than you
I wrote, produced and recorded and released a lot more records than you
Just thought that I should get more credit than you
Cause I'm better than you
See, you can lie to me but don't lie about me
Is that all you got? No wonder you grouchy
My lyrics sound horrible, your voice sounds lousy
So why you still be up on radio talking 'bout me?

Catchphrase me if you can, nobody rhyme like Javelin Fangz
I grab the mic with pure knowledge in my hand
Jump off the bridge, you fake niggas scram
I'll strangle you with dreadlocks and my bare hands
Take you to the ground, release no release, I'm a beast
Run out of wind? I'll hit you with the piece
One, two, three deceased
It's already chaos going on in the streets, it's just you and me
I'mma make you eat everything you said about the kid
Hip Hop's one of those things I'm proud I did
I respect your whole catalog and what you've said
And I'mma share your legacy with the one's who care
They say, ""Hip Hop is the greatest story never told""
Imagine what it'd look like at a hundred years old
You can't use mind control on a timeless soul
An emcee's lyrics defines his role

Close encounters with the poetic Buddha
Outside Infinity City, with programmable life-form producers
The Grand Deception, that's what it was
The idea of aliens or anatomical subs
For dinosaurs that feed off our flesh and blood
They worship the Sun, put you to death if you run
The serpent from Eden at Glen Rose, Texas museum
What's the meaning? They lived alongside human beings
Visible photography blends with lomography lens
They can't copy, no matter how they pretend
The Canibus Man, is just apocalypse in a can
But Rip the Jacker spreads soundscapes across the land
Constant to your death signals, Hip Hop jingles
I could literally kill you with a Hip Hop single
SEI is now online, the next verse reverse time
I can float a pound of steel with my mind
Tesla shield designed, obsessed with unlocking my mind
Cause there is no stopping my kind
The photons of life phase conjugation on the mic
My rhymes re-materialize as light
The lost unified field theory of Maxwell
They know I rap, but they didn't know I rap that well
I can't deceive you, the truth is out there for the people
The lies are transparent to see through
I dream the galactic green, the Northern Lights in the skies
Uninhibited by the jet stream
God is within me, God is within you too
And together we will find the truth
They said ""You ain't the same Rip, Canibus, Poet Laureate""
But you never check what Germaine think
Project CC-gate spit, comet sized ""C"" spaceship
They so shocked they didn't say shit
Lyrical Law is all about the lyrics
And it goes a little something like this, hit it",https://genius.com/Canibus-rip-vs-poet-laureate-lyrics
The Dragon of Judah,Melatonin Magik,2010,"Yeah, The Dragon of Judah
Melatonin Magik producer
Yeah
Mr. Magorium's metaphor emporium
Vanglorious warriors with deep space euporia
The Dragon of Judah executed the Lion from Narnia
I'm still trying to build God's army up
The pedagogy tried to call me a communist
And pacify my audience, sprinkle them with zombie dust
The icosahedron is a prison for a three headed demon, Hip Hop behemoth
Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus
Rearranging impossible pieces, my quantum is increasing
I am sleeping in a Posturepedic, deeply breathing
Dreaming a chakra sight-seeing, philosophically speaking
I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating
I saw police brutality beatings
I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving
I tried to search for possible meanings
But I couldn't see the logical reasoning
Said survival of the species, no Macbook no PCs
No electricity, no TV
No emcee battles, no Christmas carols
Just international tablets
Brown produce consumed by sick cattle
Bone thin mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels
Collecting contaminated skin samples
This is not natural, God damn you!
Everybody on the planet don't deserve that, not even the animals
You are completely culpable for everything you're supposed to do
Even if it's not known to you
The weight of the language I spoke to you
The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you
Are so so emotional, I don't even know what to do
So I'mma leave the choice up to you
Dragon of Judah
I spit like a supernatural computer
Professor Bis, I'm with the Minister of Intelligence
Hold me down Professor Griff

Minds that produce minds that produce minds like mines

Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy
You should've took Channel Zero more seriously
Professor Bis got a ghetto Ph.D in Chemistry
Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically
Now I'm part of the Ministry
Put my name on the blacklist
Cause I don't dickride nobody in the industry
Where's the fuckin' empathy? I've been through so much treachery
Most of the best emcees disrespected me and tried to get the best of me
Never tried to rescue me or help me with the recipe
What do they expect from me!?
Stressin' me, questionin' me to address the beef
I rep Hip Hop, Hip Hop don't rep me
I never got a penny off that Beef DVD
You mean all that money went to QD3?
I should have slammed the door in his face
If I was a different nigga, I'da been caught a criminal case
The best word to describe what you do to Hip Hop is 'rape'
Cause you don't care about Hip Hop's fate
You sit around your tables and say grace
Eatin' steak, while you live like kings and treat kings like apes
For Michael Jackson money, and still on the take
Even Tevin Campbell's money, the greed is so great
You probably dance around your mansion, like Cirque Du Soleil
Everything is paid for,
 you don't have to pro-rate
I ain't hatin', I'm not hatin', I'm just sayin'
You makin' money off the next man's struggle. Why you can't pay him?
They made millions off them Beef DVDs
But didn't pay K-Solo or Eazy E
It's called Blaxploitation
Another one of Canibus' paranoid statements that's why I'm famous
I'm just tryin' to tell niggas how the game is
Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment
If I shoot you, I'm blameless, but if you shoot me, you famous
Whats a nigga to do? Now ain't that the God damn truth
No matter what Hip Hop always lose!

OK its time to get started, don't want to but the forces forced me
With incantatory allegory they translated for me

That's the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth
Spit drooling out a very grotesque view at best
Burn through desks at the University of Budapest
Sitting in a room with a windowless view
Concentrating, looking at you
Freeze frame frozen at the very moment
The wormhole opens, you know Canibus has spoken
The circumference of a third eye so vibrant
To me, Ezekiel's Wheel was just a spare tire
My epithelial genetic fiber
Was forged in the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser
The explosion can described as a white iris
When the absolute began, I don't know where I was
I must have just been a piece of micro dust

My micro, macro robotic rap flow
The Magna Carta of the entire Rap world
Mayflower 2002 Phase 1
Adapt to the pressure gravity has laid on my lungs
The theory of communication, Claude Shannon's dissertation
With a makeover in camouflage make-up

Grab heart with bare hands, squeeze and spray blood
You iller than me? Give me a call

Dear boss, you mind if I share my thoughts?
Psychotherapy is expensive, can you share my costs?

Excessive roundedness, no space between words
Excessive cross-outs, it must be my nerves

Cemantics,Rip the Jacker,2003,"All right, yo, 
Let's talk about the incredible rap flow
We can have a Dinner for Five with John Favreau
See it comes to me natural
One of my integral attributes is to be lyrically tactful
I can prove who's nice or who's not an MC
Through falsifiable scientific hypothesis
In recent times, I find it's never been about the rhymes
The game is very politicized
Those who sympathize with their hearts and minds
Show hatred through their mouth, body language and eyes
Sometimes I say to myself, ""Why do I even try?""
In spite of whatever happens, I love it till I die


If you don't believe in the other dimensions you been duped
They're the main ingredients in this cosmic soup
See the mouse? Grab it, 
edit the edges with Avid
Is this the picture of a duck or a rabbit?
You see ass and tits, welcome to madness
Please, try to interpret the following passage
Magenetohydrodynamic mechanics
Translated into Canibus language, you'll never understand it
It's on when the crowd is cheering me on
Waving their arms like they doing Falun Gong
Firearms three quarters of a million troops strong
In a single file line stretched out a mile long
Thermodynamics of the Second Law
Isolated physical systems lead toward greater disorder
Across the dry desert in the featureless sand
Water is secondary to the meaning of man
I know but I won't tell
There's more to the human race than polymers, proteins and protocells
Chemical evolution, L- and D-form subunits
We come from the love of Hip Hop and Rap music


The scourge of the words I attack the Earth with
I bet you submerge dry and emerge wet, what you think?
Confuse my shrink with English the publication refuses to print
My daughter likes blue and my son likes pink
, 
man give me a drink
What kind of world are we living in? I think it stinks
Whatever life you live, it's a quick-sighted quiz
If you perceive something to be real, maybe it is
Force your kids to listen to 
dead prez
 before they go to bed
Send them to school, put them in special Ed
Reinforce their paranoia of the Feds
Make sure they grow dreads and they live on the edge
The philosophy of the hard-knocks
Pan-psychics sit on the block and attempt to talk to rocks
In the projects where they harvest the human crop
Organic robots that bleed when they get shot
If you can survive or thrive in the Jamaican ghetto
You deserve a Congressional medal
My heart goes out to all the young bloods
The heart has reasons the mind knows not of
From the 1st to the 12th month
I keep a 12 pump in the trunk for the day when Hell comes
Was invincible on the mic when I held one
My motto was to blaze all and spare none

Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nuttin but
Eat eat eat eat MC's, for lunch, breakfast
Hey man they been playin me all my life man
You know I won a title a couple a times did right
No but they can't hurt us man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle this li'l nigga

Yo I'mma let the world know the truth!
You don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laced your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched the footnotes, 'bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drug free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
]From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z
Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy!
You drippin with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga!

Hey hey hey hey, you just hold it right there

(Yo, yo get the fuck off me man)
If I see one more of those, you're outta here brotha
(Yo get out my way man, yo he started this shit)
You understand? (Fuck you!)
You'll be disqualified (I'll bite that nigga again!)
Stop bein a bitch (Get the fuck off me man!)
We came to see a fight

Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch ass niggas hangin out wit me man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out, or don't come out at all!

Yo, you better give me the respect that I deserve or I'mma take it by force
Blast you with a 45 colt, make you summersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk
It's about who strikes the hardest not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worse, rhyme I ever heard in my life
Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
It's because of him now at least I know What Beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga trying to make a living off of dissing
Somebody that he's got to know is better than him
But he's feelin himself, cause he got more cheddar than him
Well let me tell you something, you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick em all
I'd even wait for the studio audience to applaud 
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your 1st, 2nd and 3rd born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it, I'd saw naw he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
Trained to run 20 miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand
From a lost and forgotten land, you done did it man
You done spitted some wack shittit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'd forget it?
Fuck that! Cause like Common and Cube I see The Bitch In You
And I'mma make the world see it too, motherfucker!

I'll battle you on the net
I'll battle you in the flesh
I'll battle you over the phone, you can call me collect
I'll battle you for the respect
I'll battle you over a blank check
I'll battle you with a gun to my neck
Cause battling's my favorite hobby that's probably why you despise me
We can battle in Hot 97's lobby
Constantly battling, out in the streets
Or Battle of The Beats, we can let Angie referee
Inside the jail y'all fenced prisoners look tense
Armed with shanks waiting for the battle commence
Ladies and gents
Pick up the phone and call in the side with the highest
?pennant and decide the wench?
Lowest versus the highest, I'll start a riot
You're a virus, you run around screaming ""Stop The Violence!""

All I know is this, my felt tip hotter than hell get
A hundred eighty-six thousand miles per sec can melt flesh

Niggas feel it underground with stalactites hangin' from the ceiling
I'm out on tour with 30 city trips
Every state it's like bitches be bulimic for dicks
Screamin' the chorus half-unconscious, I hold my cordless
Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest
While the people go insane for us
I pierce a cloud and make it rain on us
Break the equipment and tell the engineer that I ain't payin for it
I freestyle the whole set
Kickin' a hundred bars, nigga fuck who's on next
Fuck you!

Fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

(Fuck) Them extra niggas that's always around you
(Fuck) Niggas that talk about you and try to clown you
(Fuck) Niggas you run into that never did nothin' for you
(Fuck) Niggas thats lyin' tellin' people they discovered you
(Okay, fuck) Niggas that's jealous cause you nicer than them
Don't give a (fuck) who you offend, you gotta fight 'til the end
If you (fuck) a groupie chicken when you out on tour
Smoke a little bit of weed with her then (fuck) her some more
Tell her to bring three friends so you can (fuck) all four
Menage-a-trios, what the (fuck) she expect you, a dog?
Almighty God blessed you with a dick and two balls
So if you like to (fuck) pussy, that don't mean that you wrong
Unless you (fuck) it raw dog
I (fuck) a nappy dug out, bust in her mouth
Kick her the (fuck) out
She'll cuss me out like

Fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

Yo, yo, your superstar status don't mean shit to me
Lyrically, sucker emcees still get fricasseed
Try to diss me now, how you sound?
Yo, whoever signed you must be runnin' the circus 'cause you a clown
You a rapper with a drug habit, hidin' the truth
Camouflaging ya needle tracks with some colorful tattoos
You was never equipped for this, never equipped to spit with Bis
I'm swift as shit, let me point out the main differences
You magnificent, I'm mic-nificent
Yo, I'd even go out on a limb with it, say you write a little bit
That don't make you a tight lyricist
Cause you don't practice or stick with it
Look at the 60 hour shifts I spend with this
I never quit, I got a gift for the art
A low maintenance cost, no physical movin' parts
In '98, niggas thought I was God,
 how the fuck did that change?
I'm still one of the illest niggas in the game
So look inside yourself and tell me what you see
If you see a hungry nigga then you lookin' at me
And its aight if you don't trust me 'cause I don't trust you
As a matter of fact I'll probably bust you, motherfucker
Fuck you!

Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you

Post Traumatic WarLab Stress,Melatonin Magik,2010,"I'm the black mutant of rap music
, half human half Vladimir Putin
After plasma transfusion I became Rasputin
The master of translucence who lives in a green house
Creatin' green gas pollution, smokin' hash from hookahs
Before Lucifer sent me back to the future to smash computers
Assassinate classes of students, I spare those who show classic improvement
Produce magic acoustics, supreme music using dreams so lucid
I can visualize my future and chose it, I never abuse it
I'm ruthless but Canibus is super illumine
You know what? I read the blueprint
Sometimes it seems like my eyes are wide shut like Stanley Kubrick
Mic Club the Curriculum II
I changed the name cause I ain't in business no more with you-know-who
He stole from Killah Priest too, his name rhymes with Clue
I found out the same time as you
You know what happens when you come from dishonest roots
You put roots on me, I put roots on you
""We live in a free country""
That phrase is so fuckin' funny, we know freedom is based off the money
Resources to hide behind lawyers, it must be lovely
When nobody can touch your lunch meat
We brainwashed, we can't get these white collar stains off
Poor Bernard Madoff belongs in the graveyard
The stock market trade off doesn't pay off
We get laid off, the country spirals into chaos
I'm no genius, I know enough not to trust FEMA
Their vaccines give ya eczema of the penis
The 
Tuskegee
 Jesus verses a sneaky Tuskegee Demon
What you gon' do when you see this?!
The oldest religions, the coldest magicians
Transmittin' live from Hell with heat stroke symptoms
Symbicort is a success for those short of breath
Got to wait for the next check cause I can't afford it yet
DZK come slaughter the set, tell Warbux he got next
Post Traumatic WarLab Stress

I open wide like a great white, mouth full of steak knives
Chewin' through the sewer's main line 'til it drain dry
And when you're waist high in waste
I make planned attacks on every last base camp in your wasteland
I scheme for weeks and draft designs on how to craft my rhymes like a mastermind
Whether young or past your prime I'll eat you alive
Ain't no motherfucking reason to try, just die (rah!)
Hope you're ready to run
I'll cut the tongue out of my son just to stay number one
No one will ever sit on my throne except my 
clone replica
Who will never be better than what they stole the genetics from
Gangbang the beats, we slang language
Which alleviates your teenage angst and break cages
Now we're runnin' through the streets with our leash off
Eatin' all your stray pets, shittin' on your police cars
Cuz' I'm a beast dog, you don't want no beef punk
Hit you with a meat log bigger than a tree trunk
I kick the shit that make you pee all on your jeans chump
Clean up after my show better bring a steam pump
I fuckin' breathe funk, ain't no fuckin' Tic Tac existent
That's big enough to clean up this act
You're trippin', you cannot begin to comprehend
If you cross me, the position you'll all be in
This isn't battle rap, maggot, this is me with a battle axe
Swingin through your Cadillac imagine that
You fuckin' headless, metal wreckage in the shattered glass
I give a fuck about your backpack and faggot ass
Dim those lights, 
I'm Kimbo Slice on a mic
But I don't lose none of my big pro fights
I just bruise dudes twice my size and crews move
When I maneuver through 'em smooth they know who's who
I clear the room with a sonic boom and nuclear plume
You should assume I ain't got a lotta provin' to do
I'm bringin' doom to musicians with a feminine groom
Kanye West, best believe I'm looking at you

Call it ill by design, that's how to define us
Cuz in the Warlab believe we got it down to a science
This is underground at its finest
The most talented rhymers around
Shittin on all of you clowns too coward to sign us
So go ahead you'll have hell of a time
Tryin' ta find a rapper with lines as compelling as mine
You talking about a fella with the will to confine himself
To a cellar developing rhymes for years and still on his grind
This is Melatonin Magik
You wet behind the ears like playing telephone with faggots
So let em know, they better own some cellulose and acid
Cause heads will roll, we send 'em home in yellow woven baskets
The ninja rap stars just as explodes to the scene
My blades will cut up your back like a rowing machine
It could get ugly if they don't intervene
Cuz I could make your life flash before your eyes like I'm throwing it beads
I'm incoherent or so it would seem
No I'm esoteric and don't care if you know what I mean
, that's the spirit
Cuz its apparent if you took half of what passes for lyrics and compared them to mine
Hip hop should be fuckin' embarrassed
So did you really want to flow with the gods?
I'm too educated, haters couldn't cope with the odds
See I studied Biggie and Pac, Hova and Nas
Paganini and Bach, Beethoven and Brahms
You are now in the presence of a master musician
I craft my rap with the precision of a mathematician
Or a surgeon, performin' a thoracic incision
A magician escaping out of his shackles in prison
Before you could even finish saying ""Oh my God!""
I'll spit a motherfuckin' verse to fill your whole Ipod
I'm a Rip the Jacker protégé
Motivated by the golden age of rap back in the older days
The incredible little fellow with rhythm and timing on instrumentals
The shit I've said in the rhyme considered a federal crime
Like blowin off your head with a 9
Anyone with a shred of intelligence could tell its just ahead of its time
I'm too sick, ain't even talking about the music
Keep my fuckin' name out of your mouth, need a toothpick?
You a little confused like who's this dude
""This is a W-A-R-B-U-X-clusive""
The underdog, like back in the Bible with Noah's Ark
To entrusted military titles to Joan of Arc
To Napoleon Bonaparte down to Rosa Parks
And the medics attempting rescue, breathin' on Owen Hart
This fucker 'Bux is the shit
So who really gives a fuck if he's busting a clip
In public drunk in the trunk of your whip
The diabolical, alcoholical, comical pharmaceutically phenomenal
Product of poppin' pills
And you are not this ill, check your doctors bill
I'm more dangerous in the streets than a toxic spill
Yo this is 50 bars of sickness

Watch Who U Beef Wit,2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000,"* soundtrack has a different beat and longer intro

Yo, you better watch who you beef wit
You might be walkin down the street, then
Suddenly you hear tires screechin
Niggas'll be hoppin out with heat and
Throw you in the car seat and leave your lady standin there screamin
The whole weekend, you get blindfolded and beaten
Nose bleedin, gaspin for air, wheezin
You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason
We even called your fam for ransom, they said, ""Keep him""
Watch who you beef wit

Yeah, it ain't no secret
Talkin that street shit'll get you in some deep shit
See, niggas know who you be wit
Where you be at, when you be gone, when you be back
All of my niggas got doctor degrees in thuggonometry
We all know how to hold the heat properly
And how to conduct an armed robbery for personal property
And can go without food or water for 24 hours at least
We fugitives, who ain't doin a bid, and shoot to live
Even if it means leavin you for dead
Cause niggas like you get scared, look for loopholes
Pick the phone up and dial 9-uno-uno
What happened to them crew of niggas that you talk about?
Them crew of niggas that you never walk without?
I know what happened; y'all heard about the double-action
Portable gatling and y'all don't wanna get blasted


Aiyyo we run up in radio stations on some unannounced shit
Catch the DJ off guard and roundhouse him
Duct tape his mouth then, put a pound to his gut
And force him to play five cuts off the up-and-comin album
Just the way I planned it, niggas'll start to panic
Brains get hijacked like planes and crash landed
Bitch niggas pray to the Lord; the black box
That was supposed to record the pilot's voice got destroyed
So watch who you beef wit
And watch who you suck your teeth at
It'll probably be somethin you regret
You get wet with horizontal rain droplets
Miniature rockets, comin out barrels of metal objects
Niggas get shot in the face
On the ground shakin like tectonic plates that cause earthquakes
Now you got your grill in the ground, how that dirt taste?
You shouldn't have started this shit in the first place


Cause niggas is comin to get you, ready to rip you
With intercontinental ballistic missiles and pistols
Put a red dot on your head like you Hindu
Then put a hole in you big enough to put my open fist through
We could verbally diss you or we could get physical
Whatever niggas wanna do, we could do it too
Cause you a sinner, I'm a sinner, we all sinners
We rob niggas for they presents at they bar mitzvahs
We rob niggas for they body organs, and sold em to the highest bidders
Things like hearts and livers
One and a half million in cash when it's delivered
Then go to Yom Kippur and beg for God to forgive us
See you the type that, finds violence real frightenin
Or hold your crucifix tighter when shells is firin
Sittin by your bed perspirin, tryin to crawl underneath it
You need to watch who you beef wit


Keep that low-down stinkin dirty motherfucker
You need to watch who you beef wit
You need to watch who you beef wit
Yeah nigga, watch who you beef wit
Watch who you beef wit",https://genius.com/Canibus-watch-who-u-beef-wit-lyrics
Mic-Nificent,2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000,"Yo, sittin on chrome, sittin on low pro 20 inch Firestones
Grippin the road with the wickedest flow
Bis is a pro, I zigzag through a slalom
Accelerate and decelerate in and out the cones
Poisonous poems travel through Walkman headphones
Into your dome, Osteoperosis your bones
Who's the nicest nigga you know in the year 2-triple-0?
Spit turn to icicles in the mid air and slit your throat
Drain your carcass dry rip out your heart bitch
I write rhymes using your blood for my ink cartridges
Paleoanthropologists polish the bones of rap artists
After I dip in my hydrochloric waters
Can-I-Bus, with the seams burstin, perfect
Everyday the Earth spins I write verses
My sole purpose as a verbalist is to make my words twist
And connect em like letters when they're in cursive

I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning

I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert
At 22 yards per second to catch me the daily delicatessen
With 30 minutes to eat 'em, 40 minutes to digest 'em
And 50 minutes for it to pass through my intestines
So ask yourself a question: Can the Canibus rhyme?
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine?
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you running by, trip you up from behind
My rhymes confuse niggas like somebody tryna gangbang
Wearin a blue shirt and red pants
Throwin up signs with their left hand, standin out on the corner at Wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband
God damn eggplants, niggas gettin me vexed man
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sanf
And I can't seem to get away from it, I dreamt that I stabbed Leviathan through the stomach and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, in the life before that
I played trumpets to warn you that I was comin
There's one billion ways to die and I already tried
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine
When I aim and fire my rhymes like a hundred cannon balls flying
Striking you one at a time in a parallel line
While the art of emceeing is steadily dying
That nigga Can-I-Bus is still in his prime, bust a rhyme

I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning
I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warningI prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning

Club Dodge - I wrecked that, Limelight - cursed that
Envy - I murdered that, Club SoHo -never heard of that
Wetlands - dried it up, Cheetah's - inside the club fired up
Looking for a chicken to tie ya up
Club New York - I heard it's hot there, beats be rocking there
Too many niggas be getting stabbed and shot there
Speed - I slowed it down, The Tunnel - they hold it down
Home of the underground, why they always close it down
Century Club -  the hot shit, House of Blues - I rocked it
112 ATL - that's the Dirty South bomb shit

The Lebron James Bond, my aim with the arm is so long
That I can tag along with Socom
I spit to the beat, flip like Swizz did to the beat
At sunrise, I spit to the East
Niggas talk shit in the streets, when they about to get released
They ain't got no lip for the beast
Make you strip like police, I point the heat
From the hip to get leverage if you more than four deep
Got a pistol grip hawk with a chrome beak
Shit is so deep, I check to make sure there's no leaks
Looking like Jada in a black Jagari
Half Jag, half Ferrari, the valet saw me
Shorty want to know how the flesh work
What's under my sweatshirt, that's why I hit the gym ‘till my chest hurt

Rip The Jacker

Yo, I dialogue with Amen-Ra 'til he gives me the nod
Or replaces me with a supercomputer automaton
I don't barter for time I'm a martyr to rhymes
And a selfish soldier wit pride that was ordered to die
A burnin' star in the sky my heart is warped wit a drive
Expressin' thoughts through a rhyme my metaphors are alive
It's like I've been crucified they hate me now like Nas
They punctured me through my side the bleeding was cauterized
I was revived after I died
Only then I saw how I was truly admired and worshipped like a god
Shit'd mired up my mind they showed me a sign
I fell off the ocean liner someone throw me a line
Let the world know the truth but it became my demise
Motherfucker you know we even I don't owe you a dime
Sometimes I feel like killin' myself they've stolen my shine
I wanted to be the illest for a moment in time
From the ink to my pen to my pad to the ink in my arm
How can one diss song possibly last this long?
Tyson ain't the champ no more them days is gone
And Rip the Jacker ain't too stubborn to say when he's wrong


I should get twenty dollars and go to Econo Lodge
And tie the sawed-off trigger around the doorknob
Call the police squad and tell them I'm in room one oh five
And that a dirty bomb's inside
Woke up in the cargo plane playin' Christy Lane
For some entertainment while I train in the misty rain
""One Day at a Time Sweet Jesus"" is playin'
I'm sittin' there prayin' you prolly can't believe what I'm sayin'
But the voice in the back of my head keeps sayin' ""Germaine
This is the real deal man this is not a dream this is not a game
The only sixteen you got from now on is locked
And loaded and in your hand
Deploy or detach on land you the man
And the pain is the weakness leavin' the body, understand?
I can reload wit a full pack call COMSAT
Tell them you need suppressive fire for troops in the back stat
Insurgence and counter-insurgence move wit a purpose
Absolutely mission critical you never get nervous
Applicate the shock tube to the surface
Standby blow it eyes open wit the scope on the terrorist
Tell him to go to hell in Arabic put a bullet through his narrow neck
Watch the wall behind him get wet
I'm an animal I'll murder you and stare at your pets
Get the tape I know where the surveillance cameras is kept


If you want a confession you got it, you want product? Gimme $20 You want gossip? I'll give you logic on any topic
Recordin' the positive data
Rip is the best rapper go confirm the status
One million page dissertation written on paper
Cheap label from Pitney Bowes' tree curator
My purification process is greater
But thinly tapered verbatim
My album is equal to over fifty acres
Can-I-Bus before the Big Bang
And after the big crunch I only gotta say it once
Let there be light and I write a sentence
The greatest discovery since 'opethicus afarensis
Back to before Sumerians landed on the Canyon
In the Cambrian carryin' bacteria with antigens
And Nine-foot stone mannequins
The key to nuclear power and Porta Libitinaria

Now when you see that big ass 'C', you know I'm comin through
And when you know I'm comin through, you know what I'mma do
I never said that battlin me, would be impossible
I just think it's highly motherfuckin improbable
You talkin to a nigga that can split molecules
To subatomic particles, strong enough to stop a bull
Body-slam two oxes and drop a mule
Urinatin rocket fuel, freestylin over gospel tunes
Rhymes by the thousands, rhymes for hours
I could kick a rhyme longer than your whole album
The kickboxer, beatin the shit out niggas proper
I beat 'em till they holla, beat 'em til the cops come
Beatin niggas til they have seizures, beat 'em til they start screamin
Like fax machines when they start receivin
Beat 'em til my own hands start bleedin
Beat 'em til they lungs stop breathin and they heart stop beatin
From 12 A.M. to 12 P.M. in the evenin
With three 15 minute breaks in between 'em
Good Jesus, that's a real West Indian beatin
That's what you get for fuckin with this lyrical demon
My bloodstream's been, contaminated for eons
I got cast out of Heaven for treason
Got cast out of the Garden of Eden for letting the reptilian beast in
Got locked up for a DUI and speedin
A whole legion of half-decent emcees'll get released when
They spit a hundred bars for they freedom
See I'm much too nice to compete wit
Too nice to flow over beats wit, too nice to hold a M-I-C wit
Off some diesel Hercules shit, I cold flip
And start to punch trees til they leafless
Inhale with two real deep breaths, hold my breath
Til the whole planet suffocates and then release it (RELEASE IT)

Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust
Yo, you ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us
When we in the war-zone, we got the chrome with us
Cuz we rollin rough, when the soldiers rush
Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust

Yo, yo
Now for the last couple of months, things been real quiet
Cause I ain't heard shit worth buyin
I'm bout to show you niggas how I'm driven
The drive comes from my lyrics and my lyrics come from my inner spirit
Vibratin and spinnin, faster than 12-cylinder engines
With nitrogen in 'em, faster than F-1 McLaren pistons
Fast enough to give your brain an aneurysm
Cause you niggas is slower than fat bitches metabolism
The way I rip apart the competition when I be spittin
The name Canibus might as well be Cannibalism
Show me a man that can't feel him
I'll show you a man that'll grab him by the neck and put his head to the fan on the ceiling
Suffer real ""Banned From Television"" shit
Drop him off the roof of a buildin and let the news film him
I hop in front of the cameras and tell 'em how I'm feelin
I tell 'em how I feel that hip-hop, should deal with it
Tell 'em how I'm tired of the state rappers in
90% of the shit that rappers kick is subject matter-less
Not original, but blasphemous, just a bunch of the same characters
Shootin the same videos, it's embarassin
Usin the same formulas to have a hit
Usin the same actors and actresses, same shit different laxative
Face it nigga you wack as shit I'm snatchin your mic
I make you run for your life, chill durin the daylight
Then track you at night, my global position is satellite
Got a infrared lens to test your body's fahrenheit
Wherever you go, I track you through hail, sleet or snow
I track you til your Caesar grows into a afro
Until you plant 'em into cornrows
Track you til your shoe soles develop holes and you get, corns on your toes
Til your teeth develop halitosis
But you been goin so long without deodorant you don't even notice

Red stuff come out his ribs like a Hollywood script
Bitch-niggas on the floor screaming for mommy and shit
Cardiologists hook up the heart monitors quick
Thermometer temperature dips below 76
That's what you get for telling niggas that you better than Bis
Not possible, if I can't pronounce it, it ain't rhymable
The audible probability probably ain't probable
Supreme rap, G Rap, underground without a rule
Shopper proof, holding hip-hop for hostage, 'bout to shoot
Helicopters stabilized at low altitudes
Talking to the negotiator, laying out the rules
In a tight compromise salute, road-block with troops
Under orders not to shoot, but they break ya vertebrae with boots
Ten o'clock news flash, Bis and G Rap
All punch bullets are lookin for them niggas in black
Lean back in the avocado El Dorado, passing the bottle
Speakin Japanese like Nomi Masho
She got a banging body, cold sushi with warm saki
If I'm rappin sloppy, she got me

Welcome to my world, danger and hazards
Gang of bastards, banging they ratchets
King and the Jacker, slanging in traffic
Claimin they cabbage, obtain half, they aiming for stackage
Get brains from the addict, keep blinging with karats
Cops aiming the 'matics, then let ya dame have it, flames to the attic
The stains on ya fabric, the paint in the graphic
Canibus and G Rap banging a classic
And if that beef on the street hate you enough, blow out ya brain in ya casket
Don't you love this drug element?
Where slugs crush ya melon and dome, chrome that's known to break bones in an elephant
Shotgun pellets and, gunsmoke, smell the scent
Big bullets, wiggle ya guts like gelatin
Cut through ya skeleton, knock out ya intelligence
Ride, stand and bite the dust
Jake wanna be like a Russian cuffed on that Riker bus
We raised in the slums with haze in our lungs
Raisin the guns, knowin;
My day'll come, razors under the tongue
Clips in the steel, bricks in the wheels
Chips in the field of fortune
Dead men walking with hits on the grills
Late night at the spot, posted with goons, dope and balloons
Coke and the doom, scheme I'll leave you open with wounds nigga
Witness G Rap put it back in perspective
Beat up shit with a dash of the peppers
Get blast for ya necklace, leave ya brains on the dash in ya Lexus
We up in the club, dash for the exit
Make ya spread 'em out, show you what this lead about
Take it from an old thug, whoever clean cold blood, believe they bled it out
Crave for the war, pop out rages with fours
Hit the jackpot, blazin the raw, gettin bands in the pores
Bitches and whores with dick in their jaws
The frame drank sick of Valor, straight bandit spot
Open up shop, turn the block to Planet Rock
Shit with no chop, slept with the Glock with the hammer cocked
Servin the fiends, hop in the Suburban and lean
Look at that don nigga swervin in Queens, player
Ballin a lot, brawling for props, calling the shots
Hit the curb, birds all on the flock
Jockin, like ""who that there covered in all of them rocks""
It's royalty bitch, fall on the cock, recognize one

Get it fucked up, I spray comments, nigga what?!

Yo, e'rything is e'rything my nigga
I ain't bitter, but if I gave you the finger it'd be behind the trigger

Up in radio, telling them what you gon' do to me
I live in the 'burbs
Clean my Winchester every other weekend with the same dirty Hanes shirt
It takes two to tango, three to jump rope
Four to bury the body, plus look out for po'
Yo I guard everything within the limits of my post
My orders is to smoke you if you get too close
The whole globe scared of my flow, spirit world scared of my soul
Nowadays it's like I'm scared to be known
The methods of my motivation is completely subjective
My perception is completely parallel to perspective
Rhyming is the reason I spit in faces
Habituation of my flamboyance without rational reservation
Whiskey, X-Ray, yankee, Zulu, unusual
Word-ologically my syllable position is beautiful
Only respect niggas if the feeling is mutual
G Rap snatch the jewels from you, I'll throw 'em in the crucible
Prolly throw you in there too, mix it up and make nigga-stew
If you can't admit I'm iller than you
Baby you sparred with the shadows, Canibus and G Rap bro
Motherfucker professionallin with the pro's

Know it's, dough over hoes, bankrolls, Rovers and clothes
And shots blow all them cowards and foes
Giacanna proud with the pros, foul mode
We quick reachers, spear with the fearless til you drip liters
Flip divas, the big secret, strip to they tits and beaver
Sip Cris' and sniff coke of the peeter
Yeah we ball big baby, look off the meter
You should see us, it's movie star status
Scar lackers lost cabbage, rip the Pablo Escobar fabrics
Froze the road we chose, not a pretty route, Diddied out
Grimey and grittied out, stack dough, jiggy out
Dime bitches behavin like ya sex slave skizzied out
Some nigga dizzy south, til he's out, busy mouth
Swerve to the curb, hit the bird split the kitties out
We kidnap for trap - blackmail for a gang a mill
Spot banger himself, fishscale rocks under the fingernails
The blood trail lead to a corpse
Treat my appetite for greed with a torch
For keys to a Porsche, to breeze in the loft
Roll up my hand sheets with the force
We squeeze off, no need for remorse, playa
Forty wild goons, with forty Calhouns
You die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves
Bless sparkle, and spark until my shorty style rules

Yo, I murder a sixteen to the point that it's embarrassing
Hide a grenade in my jeans, douse the booth in kerosene
Shatter your heart's main vein pipe
Insane at night, I might have your career disappear in plain sight
Throw you off the top of a church, stab you with a steeple
I'm bloodying punchlines like I assaulted a hundred zebras
Non-believers and their Lyric Jesus is haters that savor
They're afraid since my native halo in the cradle
Became a famous behemoth, misbehaving angel
Insane but able with razors scraping your face through ya neighbor's naval
A fatal fable from Satan's table with an unstable brain cable
I'm hateful, blame it on being biracial
I'm psychologically an anomaly
Should be given formal apologies, honestly a human oddity
A commodity, godly when rapist spitting, his blood spilling
Chino so stuck up, gotta peel me off the fucking ceiling
I'm bringing so much beef it'll make a Hindu kneel
Too hard to kill you, heart's unequal, beat you 'til you partial gristle tissue
Too fast for a photo
, I slash the rapper who'd be homo
Leave him just skull and crutches like Jackass's movie logo
Burn down your fucking apartment, barricade the fire escape
What I spit is rape, 
Chino make nightmares try to stay awake
You've never had a fly quote, nigga you and I know
The best thing you'll ever write is a suicide note
Get the fuck outta here!

Five mics, yeah
Five mics, yeah
Five mics, yeah

Canibus and Chino XL, rebels from Hell
He's a giant, I'm a stinger missile toting Keebler Elf
Keep to myself, strategic but stealth
If I don't need it, I leave it, believe it, I kept it greasy for more than sixty seasons
Tear the target to pieces, reload and repeat it
I got a billion bars but I ain't got the time to release it
And you ain't got the time to listen to it, hitman music
Blow a hole through your head and piss through it 'cause you ain't fit to do this
He vocaled it first, I vocaled it second
Lyrics get murdered, we move in and do the forensics
Shut down your studio sessions, DNA analysis and collections
Cause mic checking is a Ripper's jurisdiction
I'm a telepathic detective
Blast you with a non-kinetic weapon
 back to the essence, beyond the Outer Limits
Wicked and wretched, send you a message, lure your ass out to the desert
Motherfuckers, prepare for the unexpected
We meet, symbolic technique, anabolic release
Any MC gets weak when he knows he's dead meat
If I strike, you'll be red for weeks
You mic checkin' with a beast that'll tan you like the Mexican heat
The steps to my monastery are steep
If you still feeling froggy when we get to the top, then lets leap
Inhale the hydrogen mist, then try to get hyper than Bis
It can't get no hyper than this
Lyrical Law hands on, jet turbo fans on
Aviators
 are drawn into a criss-cross sand launch
Turn starboard but still can't dodge
Bank hard, S.O.S call command coms, concentrate, can't talk
Not out of the woods yet, you can't thank God
The Red Baron's hair is as long as Susan Sarandon
War Hawks and red hawks launch, out the underground air force
You bail out like Amelia Earhart
SEER training is for naught, I caught you before I finished my cigar
You a prisoner of Lyrical Law
Yeah, now I'ma seal the whole area off
What the fuck you thought? Ain't nobody scaring me off, aight
Niggas be rhyming like they lazy and soft
Get ate by the SpitBoss, this is Lyrical Law, yeah
Niggas be rhyming like they lazy and soft
Then get ate by a SpitBoss, this is Lyrical Law
Fuck you!

Cptn Cold Crush,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"Tranquility to infinity (yeah!)
Tranquility to infinity

Canibus is an animal with the mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I'm the all-seeing lyrical, with infinite bars of visuals
And a sideways eight peripheral
I told you I'd spit a rhyme that would melt the earth
Then ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse
On planet Earth, I searched for my tranquillity first
I said I was the illest, but it didn't help me, it hurt!
And whenever I said ""Can-I"" the crowd said ""Bus!""
Ten years later, who am I? I still got a passionate love
To be the man who I was, never give up
Irrational rush to crush every mic I clutch
When I erupt, you duck or eggs clash, flash solar blast from Bus
Then sweep you off the stage like crumbs
Grab your tongue, shout, rip it out, then shove it back in your mouth
Now, ten tell you to spit it out
I spit about them lyrics my people can't live without
Been around since '97, I've been ripping it down
Spit track after track after Beast From the East, I'm back
Before Lil' Weezy knew how to rap
When T.I. was still hustling crack, I put the muscle in rap
A 100 Bars, who fucking with that?
A thousand bars later, I ain't heard nothing from Pap
Where you was at when I was giving Big Punisher dap?
On stage with a him at the Palladium
You was in a gymnasium, I was putting chainsaws to craniums
Blazing Homo Sapiens in the atrium, ripping jaws off aliens
Performing Channel Zero in stadiums
Up at Hot 97 disgracing them
Any radio station they place me in I broke the break-beats in
I beat her, I beat him, the beat blend, I beat them
Spit a verse to beat Barack Obama if he win
I'm the Beast From the East, picking meat out my teeth
And as soon as the beat stop, I forget how to speak
I release a better rhyme seven times a week
To beat me you gotta be better than my last release
The bars rip ya face off, spit bars, spitshine ya skull
Till every rhyme you memorize is gone
Battle you for the respect in a battle to the death
Dial zero, call the operator ask for Bis
411 ask for RIP
555-1212, I rip the mic to shit
Before the Federal Communication Commission started a new division
With the intention to cripple our children
Mentally deficient from television
This radio programming we listen to got too many elements missing
Lyricism and wisdom got overshadowed by the singing and blinging
Deceived by a system thats media driven
I made a vow that I would get them and bit them, then injected my venom
And for that I was never forgiven my nigga
I let the rhythm hit 'em with a chemical algorithm
Liable to kill them if I ever get with them, I rip them
The infinite monk, All Hail Can-I-Bus
Then wake up to this Pure Uncut
How Many Emcees do I have to bust?
I'm a Patriot with No Airplay but How Come?
My Block is your block, I Throw It Up with Doo Wop
I'm the Enemy of the State of Hip Hop
Indibisible, Indestructible, Canibustible
The Adversarial Theater of Justice, judging you
Tired of you posers, I'm the rap superstar soldier on a poster
Captain Cold Crush
Tuck the heat before I brush the teeth
The athlete at the track meet with rusty cleats
Artillery like lawn mowers with four motors and four rotors
Look like mom with four strollers
Counterstrike like Black Kobra
With gasoline in the Super Soaker, walk over, I'll roast ya!

White phosphorus clouds eject through the net
Of silver mesh that protects my mouth, face, and neck
The first to introduce full-body proximity suits
The emcees who become recruits
I knew a submarine spook that accidentally armed the nuke
All he could do was say 'oops'
Knowin' the truth is moot
We got troops in a deployment loop under Title 32
The constitution been reconstituted
The contract that we signed was a con, stupid
Biofields collect energy from my flesh
Multiplicity effects take me higher yet
Happy hour empowers the mind
Red wine from divine co-combines with my neuropeptides
Let's Ride, Sumerian summary summarized
I implied some will die, some will survive
Nanochemical composures absorb the aural exposures
The stars begin to move closer
I reach out and touch novas that respond with explosions
The eye of the wormhole opens
Step out the other smokin', worshiped as the chosen
Behind me the Stargate closes
I sit down and make poetry in motion, the table and chair where I sit start floatin'
Hip-hop cops black ops take notice
Recorded, then show this, but still couldn't hold this
I work for CONUS, codename: Moses verbosus
Classified throat poet component
Serotonin overflowin', I keep growin' like the Samoans
Tsunami approachin', lower me into the ocean
Steady, telepathy stabilize levies
It save lives but I don't know how many
The flood was not an obstacle
I made a raft out of empty milk gallon bottles, for survival
The line(?)  is symbolic how they worship the phallus
Of the male chesedeck(?) true path(?) the symphonic
At the surface, what's the topic?
Aliens? Drop it
According to them, we do not exist
This is my race, I dictate the pace
But the law stipulates I spit to save face
Dead in one sense, far more alive than other
Since my female vampire lover
She asked if I love her, then bit my chest
The last time I had sex with a dragon princess
I feed(?) the keys to Da Vinci's antiquities
Beneath the patch of little ittle(?) trees
Extraordinary men, that meet to review and recommend the gubernatorial that never ends
Learn to give, the collective lives
Otherwise the global mind will affect your kids
That's how it is, you can ask his(?)
The NWO lives, nigga good riddance

How Come,Can-I-Bus,1998,"(Here come the drums)
You ever woke up one morning and ask yourself this question?
(Here come the drums)
Check it out
How come?
Thugs wanna disrespect me in the clubs
How come? How come?
Shootouts over chicken heads out there

Yo, as the universe expands
I contemplate whether it was God or the Big Bang that made man
Sometimes I wonder how come we can't live without guns
What would of been the outcome if the South won?
Think about that son
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm?
The federal communications commission listens to politicians in the position
To make certain decisions like puttin' minorities in prison
To decimating the population of women, it's called socialism
From the United States to the United Kingdom
Aahhkk, spit into the sky and extinguish the sun
But how come?

In the future, the location is planet Earth
The time and date is 1999, December 31st
11:59 p.m
The anticipation of what I think's about to happen got my heartbeatin'
We got less than a minute left before
The planet Jupiter is ignited into a star
I know it sounds bizarre but it's mathematics
A specific sign for some of the planet's inhabitants
Those who understand know what I'm sayin' is accurate
Our country is corrupt from the president to the cabinet
In the year 2 followed by three 0's
The space probe Galileo will welcome us all to channel zero
But how come?",https://genius.com/Canibus-how-come-lyrics
The Last Christians,Fait Accompli,2014,"Oblivious Christians, Muslims, most of them
Puppet Master controls both of them
All spoken language was created by Satan
Planet Earth is a captured operation
Lies cannot exist without speech
Humankind can't trust what they see, tell me what are your beliefs?
Are they a multiple or singular God
Do you follow 10 commandments or 10 thousand laws?
Life on Mars, what are the odds?
Do I remember being there, nah but what if I was brainwashed?
The tier one scientists, that's their main job
To teach you where you are, not where you came from
The telescope is offline, why?
The culture divides due to the confusion most of the time
History's always been sorted, important facts not reported
Real Hip Hop is not recorded
Dark forces, shadow sorcerers, de-facto black marketers
Families feuding in their corporate offices
The running man strangles Mr. Dawson outside Guy Fawkes' apartment
Right after the Boston Bombing
I'm in the pawn shop, make me an offer
Take two more derivatives and call me in the morning doctor
E.coli malaria water, earthquake victims still starving
Babies born with barcodes on their organs
Holocaust healthcare was never any better than welfare
A lot of people think it ain't fair
They should drop food from drones instead of dropping bombs
Jimmy Crack Corn from modified hormones
Soybean Tofu grow produce
Faggot ass doctor wanna grab your prostate and he don't even know you
I got nerves of steel protected from electrical surge
My curse words become medical terms
He said ""Allahu akbar"" and then blew up the plane
They said, ""God bless his radioactive remains""
Tactical protocol was changed from that moment on
The whole world's at war but not for long
They say from disaster comes peace, God bless the deceased
They had to pick up the rest of his teeth
First and last name, RFID in your brain
Shackled to some chains on a train
Close quarters, close margins, no wiggle room on the target
Stay close like titties and armpits
Bioceramic bone fragments, post apocalyptic mathematics
How do you weaponize a rabbit?
Fusion ignition, a new way of thinking just listen
Close enough to hear the laser beams whisper


Pyramids on every planet
Spacecrafts crash landed and disbanded, left in a sandpit
A Christian cross stands outside a crater
Faint crescent moonlike shapes glows through the vapour
21st century mega quakes shake ups
Mommy late for work with messed up make-up
Daddy lost his job, they might break up
He makes 25 cents a week (He makes what?)
The country hungry and tired, Nero is fine tuning his lyre
The empire is consumed by fire
Parliament closely monitored, school bus size comets hit Washington
People in the church talking about God again
Tsunami, what you mean God?
I mean watch the ocean seesaw up thousands of feet to the sea floor
Thought process froze, think but do not disclose
Rap music don't barter no gold
All the plaques we got were fake
Just like this horse shit reality they make you think you create
Dummies amused by the sound of their own laughter
Black gold sprays from white holes in Alaska
Didn't wanna listen when they told you
Now you eating Soybean Tofu, the government owns you
The Antichrist approaches, everybody holds their noses
They know death don't smell like roses
The minister was putting on his tube socks
Went downstairs in the elevator like 2Pac
A foreign diplomats jewel box is no match for elite rulers toolbox
Look how many rules they got
No respect, human conditional disconnect
There's nothing left, certainly less than you would dare suspect
Yet perhaps maybe there's more
Crystal quartz tuning forks, mind control forces strangle your thoughts
My land is lost and now I can't talk or walk
I cry out, ""My kingdom for a horse!""
Operation full spectrum I reviewed all of the metrics
I removed everything that was pleasant
Dig a hole to get over depression
Psycho psychic methods, if it works, then why change the method?
They control the entire globe, they say ""I don't care what you know Earthman, just do what you're told!""
Dents, Nicks, Cracks, Splints and other Swedish laments
The best poetry barely makes sense
Their pulse races, blood all over their faces
This craziness and nobody's coming to save us
His mortal wounds were heat treated, we were unable to stop the bleeding
Humans retreated, robots feeding
Boulder size rocks reeling, the Earth is squealing
Dollar crash, Wall Street didn't even feel it
Now what you gonna deal with, what you gonna eat a meal with
No tangibles? Don't even think about stealing it
Purify your h20 and stop moving so slow
You already know where we gotta go
Opsec topside, Tony Stark bomblets, rockslide
Twist metal, a bent up carbine
Sweet Caroline, double barrel time
They wanna beef, don't let em get past the cattle line
Retched, dusty ass stetson, isotope sensors
This is a community consensus
Boys will be boys, men with contaminated toys
The future is full of so much joy
Burgundy maroon John Mayer
Bluetooth black root yohimble bark player, soothsayer
Those within distance to hear, they don't care
God bless the praying prepper who is scared but prepared
A brand new world begins after pole shift planet overspin
Ahh here we go again
Modern day martyrs sing chorus
Ave verum corpus from the pinnacle of tire bale fortress
This is your world, take it back if you want it
But you can't sit at that table without a offering
Pursed lips like Mick Jagger, a bowl of hot soup cracker barrel
Raisin oatmeal and apples
Illegal 7.62 rounds in the satchel, this is unnatural
The sentence is death if they catch you
Fuel station incineration all over the nation
Devils flying all over creation
Don't open that box, it belongs to Pan
And he will compose music for the song of man
Area 51 is off limits to the intellectually timid
Humankind really has no business
If you wanna to see a fight start, turn the lights off
A dark world by a tragedy of life lost",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-last-christians-lyrics
Psych Evaluation,Rip the Jacker,2003,"All of this is part of the abduction phenomenon
And not only that, they had unusual marks on their bodies
Scars on their bodies that weren't there literally the day before

Yo, some say the pen overpowers the sword
The video camera is just as powerful when it records
Appalling footage of cops breakin' the law
Mad at you because of what you saw, now they breakin' ya jaw
I been accused of bein' internally preoccupied
Cause the rhymes talk to me and I talk to the rhymes
Clinically induced impulses reveal what's hidden
Written prescriptions, given by qualified clinicians
Lafayette peg boards be spinnin on turntables
To determine the motor coordination available
Those able to speak what I spoke, repeat my quotes
My systematic treatment approach be deep in they throats
I inject the frontal lobe of the brain with a lethal dose
Of unspeakable dope worse than opium smoke
Well-spoken like Washington Post or a Fox News Network host
Scale intelligence like Wechsler Adults
Nonnormative data, brain storage matter couldn't capture
A couple years ago they had to put it on Napster
Ressurect Rip the Jacker, rip these rappers
For every second the clock ticks, I'm a attack ya


The C-A-N dash I dash
B-U-S gets the last laugh before the critical mass
In half the speed of a bulb flash
Fire engulf that ass into a mole hill of charcoal ash
Only to be blown away by a cold draft
Wack MCs got no chance, it's so sad
They ask Canibus, ""Will you ever run out of things to say?
How much breath can a man breathe in a day?""
Needless to say, I think it's kinda deep in a way
People be like ""Bis is too ill, keep him away""
It's a good thing I got patience
I've been waitin here longer than Dr. Levinson's time equations
Trying to figure out what made men
Was it the theory of inflation or are we just a product of the apes then


You think because I'm not on a major I can't bust
And because I come from the ghetto that I can't adjust
Yeah my disposition was rough
But it turned me into a quick learner, all I need now is some luck
I used to be an undisciplined piece of fecal matter
An underdog rapper, but I closed that chapter
I deal wit my adaptive difficulty faster
And question my projected technique as a rapper
I've lost interest in the battle glory and glamour
But I can't control Rip the Jacker when he gets amped up
It doesn't matter, we all got a dark side
A loud mouth Mau Mau from the Apartheid
Yo, you wanna earn your respect then come to micclub.net
And see if you can impress the best",https://genius.com/Canibus-psych-evaluation-lyrics
Canibus /\ Cambatta,Full Spectrum Dominance 2,2018,"I'm a nine-dimensional being spitting photon directional beams
CBD serve my medical needs
Move your 
ass
, nigga ain't got no gravitas
I'ma tell you one time, me and you are not sized
There is no secret for patience, the key to being patient is sacred
And those results are not easily taken
You want to build? Do it for real
Unite, brother, 
steel sharpens
 steel
Listen to me, just (breathe)
Yea, I be old-school growling, communities by the thousands and counting
Coming down off a Mingledorff mountain
With books and tube pouches and million dollar equipment vouchers
Education, you ain't shit without it, how about it?
They took the game make it hard to support that lane
YouTube views probably bought that fame
I'd rather go to bass shop pro than deal with yo ignorant ass, yo
'cause our people are always last to know
Rap music should have been had unions, but it don't
Try to get 'em to stop the confusion, but they won't
And now here we are, 2018, still got the same problems
Chaos a prelude to conflict
You know necessity is the mother of ideas
And a bad idea is the father of all fears
The black and loud herd mentality crowd dreadlocks
Be looking like some dirty ass black and mild's
If you ain't melanated? Black or brown? You ain't down
How that sound? Who's possessed by the spirit of a savage now?
You better check them false facts in your files
Division'll have your mouth starving looking for a hand out
Man down, everybody fan out, 
it's your fault the plan went south
Say the word you the big man now
I don't think so, they move every way the wind blow
Kimbo, purse snatch a bimbo don't get shit though
Homie, these niggas lonely and phony
Crowd-funded for groceries, some of these Hotep niggas is hungry
I germinated the waters, you just tasting out of my faucet
You like the taste? We created the sources/sauces
The Jamaican mason cooking Cajun bacon with a 
fig-leaf apron
With the information to raise a nation
The green is the Ankh, the black is the God
My gold staff is a stick that makes buckets of lard
Lord Have Mercy, that nigga got bars
James Bond with a turbo-saw, but still they resent the God
Spit bars til my voice goes hoarse, circular saws slice jaws
No novacaine but take twice as long
I am the monk of Mingledorff, I mutilate every single song
My drum machine cut your fingers off
Let's talk; I see where you went wrong
You was smoking embalming fluid out the morgue and held your breathe too long
Yea, I'm 
floored
 but my God is an awesome God
Meanwhile, your paws are too short to walk with dogs
Mt. Rushmore Olmec face; your security clearance not up to date
So I'ma have to stop you at the gate
Thermovision whistles and bells, your superheat smells
So on your way to Hell let me give you this cool gel
Sound off, let me hear you yell; who you gonna tell?
When I was proof-reading the grail? You was learning how to spell
Talk to my abbot; I hooked the dragon up to your wagon
2018, you talking about horsepower, you lackin'
Layerin raps, matching, you still mackie-board four tracking
Rip the Jacker got all the action
Canibus, 
canned by the
 classic, Full Spectrum Dominance
Triple blackness, release the albino kraken

On the bible, I swore solemnly
Lord watching me, born of a moor progeny
Source of a pure prophecy
Before Constantine, travel to Nicaea and courted a core following
Modestly, freedom before sovereignty
I don't believe in the theme of a war policy
Amistad, land of the street and like four blocks from me
Cinque speaking and God orator pompously
My phrase couplets change the way brains function
Hard metal skin brown 'cause it's rain rusted
Tie ropes to your limbs then i play puppets
Cut a hole in your stomach then i make munchkins
I ate tongues to taste tastebuds
If you taste my tastebuds you'll taste bud
I showed up at gunfights and gave hugs
Make em put they guns down
Shoot em with the same gun, blame drugs
Failure is the best lesson
She didn't know my name but she kept guessing
I told her gold string makes the best threading
When I rump, my steel skin deflects weapons
Teflon chest vested, lungs burning
Breath ganja, sweat resin, ep-lep-tic (epileptic)
Before the beginning I knew the best ending
Thought of the answer before the next question
Soothsayer, earth sun moonmaker
Born instantly, mother never knew labor
Shroom taker, Obi with the blue saber
Legend King James left out like a new maker
Who's greater? I draw a circle on a Etch A Sketch
No birth defects but I got death defects
Exhale, reach out, catch the breath
We inhale it back in before the second breath
Melchizedek
, hope is like a god that I never met
Sleeping so hard that I rest erect
I found a treasure chest
I'ma carry as much as my hands hold then I'm leaving you whatever's left
I rotate the earth with my feet
Like I'm running on the top exterior of a hamster wheel
He's the Morpheus, I'm the Exile
In the simulation, we got the keys and the pills
Dr. Seuss talk to Zeus
Jump up, grab the sun, alleyoop
Break the chain to the subconscious loop
Prophets' moms are commonly prostitutes
God's recruit, lies are the honest truth
Crabs are big spiders in lobster suits (cute)
Pen sharp, when I write cut a desk in half
My writtens are better chiseled than metal slabs
Lift iron, my sceptre's a magnetic staff
Long blade hidden inside like a machete has
Repenting penning a pentagram in a pantograph
Fresh up out the pen in a pentagon with a weapon stash
Get it past, sleight of hand, Penn & Teller fast
Fast like the Pentium i9 that Dell'll have
Heavy like appendix that Adele'll have
White singer, Lightbringer, let the devil cast
Horse legs, Annamite figure goat head attached
Born Siamese till I ate the second half like a breakfast snack
Colorblind, only see things in the three that my spectrum has
Green, red and black like the Kenyan flag
Every fella Helen Keller ever met is black
I love neck so much I bought a pet giraffe
Bang arm like funny bone and then I laugh
Fist iron, beat sand out a heavy bag
Right jab, right jab, tip to the left and jab
Left body uppercut, head hit the leather mat
Hopefully he wakes up after ten seconds pass
I hit him harder than gettin past a depressin past
I throw my du-rag in the sea and trigger a three
Hundred and sixty degree tidal wave
We are each one cell in a giant brain
Life a game, self is the boss in the final stage
Compared to the Nephilim, Yao Ming's a dwarf
King of lords with double door to Mingledorff

Carry it up a mountain till we exhaust",https://genius.com/Canibus-canibus-cambatta-lyrics
Pine Cone Poem,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"The ""C"" of Tranquility, Canibus spit for infinity
I revolve with the Earth lyrically, uh (echoes)
Yea ya'll wassup, The Ripper right here Can-I-Bus
Yo, yo
I rest alone in a cold cavern composed of stone from old Agate
A sarcophagus filled with gold tablets
The archaeological dig-site, excavated the bone matter of this unknown rapper
The blood of the Gorgon was used as a cure for the poison
The poison that destroyed his organs
His DNA was shaped like a Series of sideways 8's
Space time is converted to time space
The soundwave signals looks like ocean tides when they ripple
He spit to precision instrumentals
Sidewinder rhymes hit you, split you
The target area surface was no wider than a nickel
Control Room simple.. His chair was chiseled from quartz crystal
It gets so hot, his skin sizzle
He piloted the missile from a digital menu
Inside remote headgear he would put on to look into
By mastery of the mental
He was able to see what the past and future civilizations had been through
Acoustic imagery transmitted through the music n energy
When I'm spittin no distance can limit me
The gallery of my art was refabricated and placed in a Ark
But grave robbers rip the pages apart, they got caught
Whoever told me the secret is now dead
I cannot tell you or I will end up like them!!
The meaning of these rhymes are dead to the modern day mind
Even if you hear this a thousand times
Because if this many have died
Ya inner light will not shine if ya Pineal gland is calcified
The silver cord is a metaphor for the will of the lord
I was called to climb aboard and explore
That's when I saw the tree of life in the yard
The apples on the floor were gored to the core!!
The coil spirals remind you, but be mindful
External experience reflects what's inside you
Inside us all, behind the wall, inside ya skull, but exposed in a song
AHHHHHH, I was struck in an electrical storm
The flesh on my left arm is scarred the mic's gone!!!!!",https://genius.com/Canibus-pine-cone-poem-lyrics
Cingularity Point (Original),The C of Tranquility Demo,2008,"The C of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? What do you really see?
I see a revolution in the industry
That will ignite the rebirth of MCs lyrically
The C of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? What do you really see?
I see the partition of God's religion
Become united by our bars and our common visions
The C of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? Yo, fuck the hook!

These rhymes resemble knots being tied
The timeline becomes a nonlinear noose that will snap your mind
First: Sever your spine, Second: Normal limb configurations
Are dismembered and disconnected, very unpleasant
My third effort employs absurd ethics
Kangaroo execution court is in session after dawn but before breakfast
Expert effective mass burial method so well measured
It's impressive and intensive, not to mention expensive
Extensive templates taken from all global nano-industrial sectors
No wonder I'm so aggressive at Tetris
Pardon me, but I must beckon your attention
For no more than several seconds with the minor hypocritical questions
Let's say, I had to make an exception
Where I complied to exhume a body for postmortem autopsy inspection
I request the best yes-men
That promptly recovered the radio frequency identification pin
Then trigger the transponder located under the skin
Of the deceased until it showed me a grin
If that went over your head then I'll be more than pleased to show you again
But I must rescind, I have pressing matters to attend
It's my wife's birthday and I can't be late for delivery
Of her customized marble grey bidet, good day
What the fuck did he just say? See, why can't I bust my way?
Since '98 you could trust my name
I've adapted and adjusted my aim accordingly
The leap years are boring to me, I speed up quarterly
The Golden Era of Rap will always be apart of me
The future talks to me because the present is ignoring me
My destiny is calling me, the armory of God is guarding me
But all you can see is holographic artistry
This is were the road forks, my rhymes leave you lost
Under a blue moon, ice crystals, fog, and snow fall
Been a long time, spitting long rhymes, but I never left you
I always came back busting rhymes that were special
Back then, I wanted to impress you by addressing the truth
Nowadays, I'm just confessing in the booth
The music is layered, not computer generated
A human made it to satisfy unusual craving
The mystic in a room with crystal walls and floors
Looking into a crystal quartz orb, reciting lyrical law
That cause warm feeling sensations precipitating from the finger tips
To the arms, to the lips, to the jaws
To a gold tongue that spits to the tone of the drum
With the oxygen that flows down the throat to the lungs
'Til every color of my Chakra glows brighter than the Sun
You and I become We, We become One
And the clarity of Singularity has begun
Between zero point zero and zero point one
Combinatorics, anything of this persuasion
Is considered ageless beyond the matrix
Beyond time displacement of space and spaceships in oasis
Beyond the reach of human contemplation
Through my music, magic and convoluted interaction
Rip The Jacker shows you the future in fragments
Through madness my view is expanded
Request passage permission is granted
I'll introduce you to the language of dragons
To help balance near impossible trances in the labyrinth
Of the enchanted where air quality is unbearably rancid
From evil spirits, temperatures frigid
I cross wooden bridges over methane rivers, it sounds crazy, but listen
Concise lyrics strike down from the heavens
A titan like Mike Tyson, 'Beastmaster' with a Tiger and Pigeon
A four finger ring with a eyeball in it for vision
Cause I ain't scared of no 9 foot 11 winged lizards!
I'm known as the Ripper, my soul was delivered to a wizard
For spiritual slave labor in a prison
My life is my sentence, so I live it
But I studied the physics and understand it, so it's only a visit
I look at myself in the mirror, I see a stereoisomer image
I know it's cryptic, but you like what I'm spitting
M-M-M-M-Master in the art of rhyming, yield so many surprises
I've found excessive ferric-iron in my perinatal sinus
Remote viewing the globe, what I am shown runs my blood cold
My occipital lobe might explode!
The Godzilla Zillah God, enscripter encryptor
I drink the Elixir of Knowledge like it was a liquor!
I ain't a rapper, I'm a Ripper Slasher, Supreme Dream Catcher
Brother Frater who'd rather attend to other matters
Like mastering words, spell cast a curse you haven't heard
Incense I burn smells like a bag of herb!
I walk among the living hidden, but spitting, they bid me good riddance
Cause nobody knows what I've written!
Zecharia Sitchin in Hell's Kitchen, heavy lifting
Mixing, vocals switching with no mittens, my women keep bitching
Bitches drug experimenting, bed wetting and blood letting
White witches, black magic, rough wedding, with a fuck ending!
I ain't into fashion, think I got jokes?
Keep laughing, 
we'll have the ceremony in a cabin
Rapping my only compassion that outlasted everything I ever had in life
And it still respects the Master
During the brides reception, the Tree of Life supplied me the weapons
Inside the zodiac, divided in sections
I categorized five elements inscribing the lettering
Baphomet's unintelligible intelligence is benevolent!!
The initiate magician, not ready but willing
To perform molecular fission with emotions and feelings
I stand before the Rabbi with cat-eyes, he looked high
I don't mind, the motherfucker look crazy all the time
He asked me for the wedding band, I gave him the bride's severed hand
Punishment for touching another man
I'm just a poor shoe cobbler from Guadalajara
Who came in contact with scholars that studied Kabbalah
I do not wish to be a martyr and follow the footsteps of my father
I want to live the live of an 'honest farmer'
We all became sombre as I placed the animal on the altar
Started the fire, rinsed my hands in some water
Look into my eyes, I hypnotize my bride as I walk towards her
The congregation wouldn't take their eyes off her!
I hear moans and weeping coupled with soft but laboured breathing
I pinch myself, am I dreaming?
Invisible people speaking, we've met, but I don't remember meeting
I don't remember these traditional teachings
I know I'm reaching into unallowed boundaries, but the rhymes are increasing
My mind is breaching, I find it pleasing!
Inside the Theatre of Bar War, unlimited seating
The kills, still fresh, the cadavers, still bleeding
The war drum pounds like the wings of a owl beating
Right before it snares its prey and it begins feasting
How nice of you to join me this evening
To see the symphony for its surface complexity out of deep simplicity
You see, I achieve tranquility with obscure metaphors
Entering doors not placed between walls, but in the floor
Midnight strolls through groves of roses, sharing moments
With whatever hostess is closest, before the solstice approaches
The fire burns, but it burns smokeless
Ogres on flying locusts screaming, “Buenos noches!!”
The final battle with Vrill, the war cries build
Run them over on the battlefield with chariot wheels
My shield is composed of meteorite stone
My sword is honed from a red dragon's rib bones
Ripping and spitting basic complex combinatrix
For the agents trying to hack into my Matrix!
Five out of ten cases are found with their heads hacked off
In several places, hanging from metal braces
Long ago, the ghost of Plato befriended me
With a amulet intended to anchor my memories
Tabula Smaragdina
, glow greener than any known reefer
Harness the ether, talk to your leaders
The seekers of beautiful bars, recording the position of the stars
Undermining these immutable laws
Correlating, DNA crossed-fading, what's the point in waiting
We're all aging, it's yours for the taking
A black hole in the making, nothing but a wound gaping
From a womb where there's no escaping
Only life-forms racing before and after mating and merry-making
With partners that aren't even facing, what are we chasing?
Our ancestors asked the same thing
And we've gotten no closer then they've been, so I prey for the day when
We don't even need eyes to confirm
The science and the poor education we've put our faith in
I don't write this to perform it, nor do I say it, to record it
I feel that I am answering a calling
Fantastic, rhyme mechanics, like that of a blind pianist
The keys are metallic, my fingers are magnets
The music is magic, what is this madness?
The stanzas are rites of passage
Your left brain habits become your baggage
The masses become savage, roaming the streets with torn fabrics
Creativity is less than average
Every baby is born a bastard, so why did you have it?
This question requires no answer, I understand it
The ""C"" of Tranquility, that is all I seek
Nothing is complete without every separate piece
The ""C"" of Tranquility, that is all I seek
Nothing is complete without every single piece

The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold,? What do you really see?
I see a revolution in the industry
That will ignite the rebirth of emcees lyrically
The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold,? What do you really see?
I see the partition of God's religion
Become united by our bars and our common visions",https://genius.com/Canibus-cingularity-point-original-lyrics
Secrets Amongst Cosmonauts,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"*Spanish speaking soldiers*
""They have different videos that's caused by these Cosmonauts""

""And so, if you take all these together
Dimension of the Earth in nautical miles
21,600 and you divided by 33; you'll get...""

Secrets Amongst Cosmonauts
These are the Secrets of the Cosmonauts
I know I rhyme a lot
This is the most important rhyme I ever said in my life
Stop the hatred, and stop being racist
I believe the Cosmonauts will come down and save us

(We share the song) This is a song, written by God
(Especially for you) Especially for you, this is the truth
(There's a story) A story of humankind's glory
(Of what people do for you) I'm tellin' you the Cosmonauts love you

Twenty-one thousand six-hundred nautical miles
I got the same amount, if not more audible styles
By no means am I to interpret the absolute
I'm merely a vessel that the entity chooses to use
I'm raw energy, just like you
I don't teach cause Teachers only receive contempt from the youth
I know what I know, there's no need to convince you
The poetry's fairly simple, you perceive the visual
The grass isn't greener, it's browner
I believe in the power that spins the Earth around upward and outward
You say, ""You don't like the album"", I say you a coward
You say you don't like the beats, I say what about them?
Whether or not you like the lyrics I would not be surprised
If you the devil in disguise I can see it in your eyes
We are all equal; we are all sisters and brothers
In spite of our colour, all we have is each other, they love us


Your sexual orientation is none of my business
But don't lie to yourself, and don't lie to the children
Some of us are healthy, some of us have diseases
But if you look at the whole world we represent the human species
You can't ignore continents while they starve
You'll be wearin' their shoes before long
As the Globe becomes more warm
Families hold on but their country is war-torn
The prophecies are forewarned
You would've thought Katrina storm taught y'all
But nah, you're still too distracted ain't y'all?
I've come to learn that the Cosmonauts up high
Don't believe that we deserve another chance and I'll tell you why
We watch each other die, and we're still racist
Not in my household, but in other places
The patience of the Gods have run thin
Because of your sin, the period of purification will begin


The procession will wash away
The world's sins with Tsunami's and Whirlwinds
Our world ends, but then it begins again
Six-thousand four-hundred eighty years later
The next civilization will dig our artifacts out of a crater
They will say that we were great but that they are greater
Humankind will continue to search for his creator
Wage war against the forces that try to enslave us
Send space probes to our celestial neighbours
We could stop the hatred; if we stop being racist
I believe the Cosmonauts will come down and save us
If humankind will accept all races
There's no reason that the Cosmonauts wouldn't save us
Love your neighbours; we're different, but God made us
Love all races, the Cosmonauts would love to save us
Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth (B.I.B.L.E.)
Wake up, stop the hatred, the Cosmonauts wanna save us

""Advance knowledge that people in general will never hear
Is passed on to the chosen ones that are chosen to have this..",https://genius.com/Canibus-secrets-amongst-cosmonauts-lyrics
Indibisible,Rip the Jacker,2003,"I transmit images over the distance
Using the inflation premise of 10 to the minus 32 seconds
Back to the Canibus era, my eponym is apparent
Those who hear my efforts gotta give me the merit
Off lyrics alone I'm a legend
But I can't take credit, the English language was not my invention
It's the way I put it together
, 
the incorrect English editor
Can't nobody ever do it better
People forget but the history will remember
I plead guilty to the charge and accepted the sentence
Let the records show I resisted under the pressure
My short but precise endeavor to raise the measure


Hip-hop forever, that's what I see when I look in the mirror
Regardless of whether I'm not a bestseller
I'm a first class spitter
, 
the literal literature ripper
Painting pictures for intelligent listeners
From any and all dispositions
The fusion of what's written creates a fission called Canibusism
The intellectual division of science and religion
People waste their momentum trying to defend it
All I do it put it to ink then put it to print
See what you think, maybe I should speak to a shrink
I could fix the way they look at the world
They read all these books in a barrel but they can't think for themselves
Self-contained, I'm all balls, belts and brains
Must be strong cause no one ever help Germaine


Observe the whole world's pain and tell me you ain't tired of prayin'
The Catholic faith will never be the same
You could be put in chains 'cause you got a Muslim name
Sent to Guantánamo Bay and tortured for days
Man, I'd rather buy some land and grow an orchard of grapes
Drink vegetable juice, stay away from steaks and shakes and snakes
These rats in the corporation's is fake
Nobody ever gives you what they didn't already take
Invest and wait, you'll be broke till you break
Man you learn to pick a lock you wanna open a gate
I mimic haters like flight simulators at air bases
Recovered from an inverted spin, now I'm famous
Those who respond to Rip the Jacker with hate
Show poor taste and only exacerbate their fate
MicClub.net, get it right motherfucker
Get it right, get a mic",https://genius.com/Canibus-indibisible-lyrics
Chaos,2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000," *acapella*
Yo yo yo
Now ain't nobody fuckin wit the mastermind
I'm like Einstein, a hundred and fifty times magnified
Nicola Tesla an', Jon Von Neuman
All wrapped up in the body in one human
I rhyme the tightest, shine the brightest
I blind the optic fibers in anybody's iris
When it comes to rappin, I'll smash your ass
Whether you Latin, Black or Anglo-Saxon
I'll smack you wit a backhand
That crack your back like chiropractors after looking at your CAT scan
In between albums, I've become a masked man like Batman
And stalk my own rap fans
I'm like a madman fighting a war
Throwing lightning rods, swinging lightning swords
Blow you away with a force that'll leave your body lost
Gone, nothin to mourn, nothing to do a autopsy on
I rock till I can't rock no more
Till I can't get no motherfucking props no more
Till they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour
Till 2000 B.C. ain't hot no more
I'm a dragon wit the head of a lion, jaws be like saws grinding
Claws rip through walls of cast iron
I slap fire at a hoodlum, pull out steel and start shooting
I clap iron like Duke Nukem
Try to attack 'Bis, you get your face stomped
Flatter than a compact disc wit black Timbs
Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim
Flatter than the knife *Jigga* stabbed Un wit

If you the first nigga that laugh
I'll blow you in half
The first nigga to talk trash
I'ma blow you in half
The first nigga to show your ass
I'll blow you in half
The first time'll be your last
'Cause I'ma blow you in half

Yo check it
I destroy a whole city block when I'm ready to rock
Blow the speaker box, magnetically shielded or not
Magnetically energy propagates in radio waves
Oscillating lyrics and beats copulate then pop your tape
Manipulating space in large proportions
Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talkin
About shit like supernatural forces
Gnomes and fairies and superstring theories
Most of you motherfuckers barely
Even understand the English language, much less think clearly
When I die, will I go to Heaven or Hell
Or will I end up in a place called the Van Allen Belt
I researched my roots, looking for proof
The best place to hide a lie is between two truths
The aftermath of a nuclear blast
When the average death sentence becomes a death paragraph
I dig a 5 by 9 rectangle in the grass
Read your epitaph and bury your ass
As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly
I'll sing all of your greatest hits oldies on karaoke
Chorus 2x",https://genius.com/Canibus-chaos-lyrics
Doomsday News,2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000,"If I had half as many bars in gold as I had in lyrics when I flowed
I'd be the richest man on the globe
Niggas wanna know is Canibus gold?
That's a stupid-ass question, motherfucker, is Canada cold?
'Bout a thousand degrees lower than liquid nitro is
Five thousand degrees hotter than flame throwers
I reflect light, bounce off walls and wreck mics
Disconnect your windpipe by cuttin' your neck with a knife
Rip through everything from tissues to blood vessels
My ninjitsu kill you with the art of Tenchu
I zig-zag-zig, crushin' a kid
With G-forces violent enough to crush your ribs
Like pilots that fly Russian MIG,
 comin' to punish you pigs
Give a fuck who you is, nigga, Canibus in ya biz
From the lowest point in the planet to Mt. Everest
I kick the illest shit, spray-paintin my name across the pyramids
The rap terrorist, Professor Emeritus
Fuck forbidden fruit, I was eatin' pussy in Genesis

What you got niggas that's ready to brawl?
I'll give you the phone card and the celly to make a call
What the fuck y'all bitch niggas actin like y'all tough for?
We'll stuff y'all, uppercut y'all, gun butt y'all
On stage we break arms, legs, backs and jaws
Enough damage to cancel your tour (Fuck y'all!)

Now, I said it once and I'll say it a thousand times
I got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind
You wanna a piece of mine? Fine, we can take it outside
Otherwise, you're wastin' your time
'Cause I'mma shine for the one-triple-9
Niggas gamble and damage they eyes
Goin' blind, tryna keep up with these lyrical lines
The type of nigga you can't flow behind without a dope rhyme
You fuck around and get clotheslined 'til you nosedive
We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere
Any place, anywhere, you niggas don't have a prayer
'Cause doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared
They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air
With a long white beard flamin', hot enough to sunburn Satan
Hotter than white people takin' vacation
Out in Jamaica, out in the sun bathin'
Sun bakin' in gamma ray radiation
 'til they skin color look Cajun
Motherfuckers start agein'
To the point where they faces shrivel up like raisins
And they become cancer patients


Yo, yo, yo, I manipulate the metaphysical power
To hold my breath for half an hour
Continuously breathin' outward
You ain't an MC, you a coward
I make wack rappers lose control of they bladders
And piss in they trousers
Pink pussy possum niggas play dead
While my heat waves hit, and verbal x-rays evaporate shit
Water molecules get transformed to vapors
My lyrics turn the Pacific into a dry lakebed
Electromagnetic cassettes melt tape decks
Niggas battle in space; tryin' to hold it down
But they can't 'cause they weightless
Amateur swordsmen gets stabbed through they face mask
Tryin' to escape death
A world where the whole globe will contract Ebola
From drinkin' spring water darker than Coca-Cola
Human with AIDS, computers with Y2K
I rock rhymes counter-clockwise until doomsday
Fuck y'all, fuck y'all, fuck y'all",https://genius.com/Canibus-doomsday-news-lyrics
Pay Me in Gold,Fait Accompli,2014,"Finance yo' fine ass, they cherry pick off the street
They own everything that we eat
They control everything that we see
It trickles down to the beats from the temple on high with the priest
Where they sacrifice blood to the beast with javelin teeth
Mother Mary Magdalene said a prayer with a tweet
It's only weeks away, it's called modern day D-day
""I don't know shit,"" that's what the Chief say
The Devil told me Jesus died for nothing
The evidence he showed me: it's all a corruption
Corruption everywhere, let's be clear: The End IS Near
The Devil desires to tempt your ear
The Book of Life has no names, just shackle and chains
Day traders reading Elliott waves
Dark entities, deep enclaves, houses sheep and slaves
The maze of malnutrition and malaise
HAARP, one trillion watt warp
Split a Wal-Mart in half like the Red Sea to see what you bought
Oregano oil, one quart for immune support
Ban Ki-moon, Blood Moon source doom and default
Go for it, one decimal point away from rolling a joint
I bought an IPO Cannabit coin
Yeah, the dye is cast, currencies dive and crash
One world government, at last
An octopus with infinite arms says, ""There is no God
The little g will be a big G later on.""
A delicate balance, the challenge is dividing his talents
While maintaining a colorful palate
You struggle to overstand the true history of man
But the pursuit of such knowledge is banned
Google Glass hardwired to the human glands
Used to take two to dance, now it's just artificial intelligence
Glass–Steagall shattered from the wall to the ground
The nobility announce, ""They are forced to bow!""
They won't get to reintroduce the Bradbury Pound
Cause the red Chinese probably snatched up every ounce

Horsementality,2000 B.C. (Before Can-I-Bus),2000," The beginnin of the end niggas!
 Yeah, we gon' rock this shit forever
The alpha and the omega
The Canibus'll make your eyes redder
FUCK y'all niggas talkin bout cheddar
 Brought to you by your millennium group, The Horsemen
 Four swordsmen
 From the land of the lost
 Ras Kass, Killah Priest and Kurupt wit Can-i-bus
Throw your 4's up or get your vocal cords cut MOTHERFUCKER
 Wavin the four-four!

I'm headless nigga, but I packs a big piece
Blastin, they let assassins loose on the street
Murderous notes I wrote, I lacerate throats
I toss fire at niggas; motherfuck the six
The condos is supposed to be flip bricks
All thirty-nine of your bitches, pretty-ass bitch nigga
I'll throw some fucked up kicks on
Next is a small tank top, the spot, shot it up
Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up
Cause we don't give a fuck, the Headless Horseman Kurupt
See I'm off the wall nigga, Horsementality
I'm a Horseman nigga and that's all I'll be
See I'm tired of the sparkly shit, niggas talkin shit
I wanna see the streets dark again
Let the heaters spark again, police callin all cars off
Powerful as a motherfuckin Vulcan
My specialty is - poetically lyrically energetically
Ultramagnetically Dogg Pound pedigree
Fuck the shiny shit, fuck a bitch, only grimy shit
Dirty shit, holocaust in thirty-thirty shit
Mxyzptlk, assassin Sicilian
Kill women and kill men, and kidnap children
For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen
Slice your Achilles tendon, the Headless Horseman
And we abide by, the code of the streets
The makings of a real MC (C...C...C...C) yeah bitch!

So just abide by what you ride by
Cause we abide, by what we ride by
Just abide by what you ride by
Cause we abide, by what we ride by

What the fuck y'all done started; four apocalypic prophets
Appearin outta floatin objects, wearin Middle Eastern garments
Long trenchcoats with our hands in our pockets
Slappin all you scary-ass rap artists, half-retarded
Swear by our forefathers
Anything you speak, think, or show will be disregarded
Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness
Bring you out the other side, as a carcass
I'm heartless, regardless if y'all claim to be Gods or Goddess
To me, y'all all garbage; I see all of y'all as movin targets
And my lyrics be the atomic rockets, cosmic vomic - spittin
Hittin at y'all Vietnam vets
Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest
Castin meteor storms and comets
Now who wanna make the next ras comment
And be the first one left unconscious?
After I squeeze your head like the Charmin
Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat
And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts
Satanically sacrifice your ass like an occult
Have your seance inside of a dark synogogue
We was lyrically sent to y'all
Like the Men of God to put a end to y'all
I sniff bites like dogs to get the scent of y'all
Horsemen, we be scorchin when we be walkin
With the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin

Let's air it out like the breeze
Now watch me do one-armed handstands
And hang these N-U-T's over seven continents and seven seas
Streets is Lebanese
Be rockin Bulgari wrist watches and sniper marines
Most of these MC's can't even rap, just model and go gold
And get big-headed like they swallowin colleges
I spit empty gravesites, rap stars fill 'em up
You what? Thirty, forty years old and still wack as fuck
Me? I ain't even in my prime
When I write my dopest rhyme, Western civilization declines
Catch me hoppin off the A train in a New York state of mind
But I rep Westside, so I keep L.A. time
That's a three-hour difference;
So when my bitch is a six, she's really a nine
In seven days, she'd still be a dime
Call me Blaze Skywalker hittin jugular veins
Crack open your skull wit a paper weight and suck out your brains
Kiddo, I be doin my thug-thizzo for shizzo
And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow
So what's happening, from P.I. to '99 Madden
Since police be jackin blacks, I talk to pigs in Pig Latin:
Uck-fay ou-yay itch-bay et-lay a-igga-nay-play
And free Keith Mur-ray (Horsemen)

Yo, yo, yo
I kick a verse at six-hundred and sixty-six megahertz
Make lightnin flash across the sky everytime I curse
Six-hundred and sixty-six flashes
Give out six-hundred and sixty-six lashes
To the backs of six-hundred and sixty-six Master of Ceremony has-beens
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
If he's a *Catholic* I nail him to a crucifix
Then I beat him till he's blackish-blueish
Then perform acupuncture wit six-hundred and sixty-six toothpicks
Beat em with two whips; with pieces of broken glass glued to it
Your whole crew get spayed and neutered
As soon as I aim and shoot it, you get sprayed with bullets
Your armored cars and your kevlar vest, is useless
I'mma fuck all of you pussies like group sex
You get six-hundred and sixty-six years imprisonment
For bitin off another nigga's shit, you bitch
You got caught, now you on the other side of the law
Snitchin on mad niggas in a soundproof court
To get some of your sentence knocked off (nah nigga) you wildin'
But you still be in Rikers Island getting forced to toss salads
You scared of that, wit a phobia fear of that
I'mma tape it on the digital video DAT
And send a copy to Miramax - leave you exposed
Turn all the fiction to fact, so everybody will know
You a sucker-ass nigga, father-fuckin ass nigga
That got fucked in the ass by your father figure
(No matter who?) I'll bruise and bash you, blast you
Autograph you wit a bullet wound for a tattoo
Deliverin mind blowin rhymes and poems
Controllin my tongue when I'm flowin like pilot controlled Boeings
When I get bitten, I bite back, quicker than Tyson attacks
I don't give a FUCK if I don't get my license back
So, take caution
The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then
Gallop Northward
MC's take caution
The Four Horsemen'll chop your head off wit a sword then
Gallop Northward motherfuckers; yeah
So just abide by, what your ride by
Cause we abide by, what we ride by
Just abide by, what your ride by
Cause we abide by what we ride by, HA!

Wavin the four-four! All you heard was ""Priest, don't hit me no more""
Wavin the four-four! All you heard was ""Bis, don't hit me no more""
Wavin the four-four! All you heard was ""Ras, don't hit me no more""
Wavin the four-four! Aiyyo Kurupt, hit them niggas wit the hardcore!

Yeah nigga, I'm headless without thoughts
With my motherfuckin arms crossed
I transform from a Dogg to a Horse
Took over the whole race course
To throw the jockey off the saddle
Now who the fuck really wanna battle?
Got me a pistol, launch it off like a missile
Let it whistle, they fall fuckin round wit the Dogg

Fait Accompli,Fait Accompli,2014,"Type on keyboard blind, sign in, everybody say, ""Hi""
I'm the holy Hip Hop magi
Them motherfuckers kicked down the door, I got excited
When I realized who it was I got silent
Morgan Freeman told the country it's all over
Danny Glover said the same thing but slower
Now they say he's worse than Carter
Him and his big head daughters
They don't care collapse of the dollar
The population of a planet cries out for more
They are ignored and repeatedly provoked to war
Martial Law, what you think they was hoping for?
All you gotta do is walk through that open door
Modern man is but a primitive hologram
Transhuman's revolutions with pots and pans
The god gene is the dominant strand
The politics don't matter, the left, right or the communist plans

If you don't want beef, pipe down that inflammatory speech
Throw you in the Goulag for weeks
Which Pussy Riot whore got a passport to go to Hong Kong?
Nah nigga you ain't going on tour
The hood die young with guns and tied tongues
Daughters and sons smoke drugs that fry lungs
When liars tell the truth, nobody believes them
Then along comes somebody they can trust that deceives them
One ounce of silver, one once of copper
That's all I got, that ain't enough to stop 'em
The problem that we face is race
Even if you ain't black, you can't escape this draconian fate
Partnership, transpacific, free speech no longer permitted
Guilty as charged, you will not be acquitted
Listen, you taking a piss? You better not be
You on the black list, everybody 'bout to get stripped
Yeah, you know what they say, it is what it is till it ain't
So what, you go hard in the paint
Whatever, hurry up and wait till it's too late to change the stakes
The nuisance abates, the truth is you're abused by the state
Get small, stay home and pray
Raytheon drones strafe, no home is safe
Don't watch the throne, watch that Nordics face
Iditarod dog race across unthawed straights
For the agent provocateur in all lace
Muscle therapy Kate, Uleander in a sauna feeding me grapes
She pour cold champagne in the warm spring lake
Brought her to my seed vault for the cost of freight
""
Svalbard
"" how's it feel to rule the world? Wait!
I got one kernel of corn on my plate
Stop dreaming get back to base
Well OK, but why the flight time shorter than the pat downs take?
It's because freedom is fake in a police state
USA constitution got shredded in '08
Able bodied adults can't get out of the cult
They say it's the Luciferians fault
And now Holocaust healthcare is not much better than welfare
Assassin dress like mailman
Violence doesn't discriminate, it's just has to intimidate
Now you got a Zimmerman in your face
I see the people of the world protest in vain
While the Antichrist reigns through the sons of Cain
Righteous people of the world protest in vain
While the Antichrist reigns, reigns, reigns and reigns",https://genius.com/Canibus-fait-accompli-lyrics
Anagram Phoenix,Full Spectrum Dominance,2018,"You don't know what's next
Generation X
 
gotta prep
Only for those who can see it:
The iPhone is an anagram for the phoenix
I'm a woodwind instrument repairman
Dashing, handsome and daring; a Tuskegee airman
Reduce my ground-speed to give the underground what they need
If they don't know what to believe:
Then I don't know what to tell 'em
Bliss; ignorance is a weapon
Illusions in the middle of the desert
Or in a sanctuary city, I stand corrected:
It's all connected, take an alter exit
Move on to the next shit
G-chrome, can't talk late night on the phone
'Cause you don't live alone
1 on 1 with Angela Yee
Bacon, eggs and cheese
Lowered torso, legs and feet
Hip hop's first Elon Musk
Iron lungs with guts
Take it back to the rewind button
He was born as a baby in a manger in crystalline light chambers
They called him a microphone mangler
Developed as a unit, before it's one love it's one music
His sound gave shape to the future
Guess what? the natty dread can't stand the feds
He eat banana bread livin' off grit in the tent
Present crisis PR expert
Musicbox News network
Where they trade net worth for wetwork
YouTube: Canibus search, skip over the battle
I been rappin since Eve took a bite out the apple
The Book of Eli transformed my mind and designed
The Paul Thomas Anderson storyline
The expression: ""Reason without rhyme""
Clearly comes to mind
That's why I rarely dumb it down sometimes
It's an accelerated positive feedback loop:
Uses Mars system surveillance: I need that, too!
The bulk data transfer from the West-Indian black panther
Search the universe for answers!
We don't know what's next
Generation X gotta prep
What's comin down the pipeline next?
The iPhone anagram for the phoenix makes sense
Hip Hop robotics with upgraded optics
My wardrum mounted on the wall where I found it
Mad-dog maddis mathematics
Please read the caption:
Binoculars read your lips from the rafters
Thanos; cook mean on that drum machine
Take it back to the 20,000 man street team
Baby-boomers from the future wearing some faded ass booms
With an old school gold-plated ruger
""
How many times did they shoot ya?""
What the fuck kinda question is that, who's the interviewer?
Hydrogen powered limited edition Eddie Bauer
Gold-colored clouds spark electricity showers
When I beam down and rap
I yellow tape that
My Man My Mellow won't even say that
I lift up my praise and make the rain fall sideways
Resurrect Hip Hop from the grave
The third-eye brigade, the blockchain bars on a cage
Call out the pressure on the gauge
Extraction in a half hour, put some man-trousers over them skinny jeans
We need man power!
Step into my office, excuse the faint smell of nail polish
I'm water-proofing my electronics
Right, I got things to go bump in the night
Fight? I throw you in the trunk space with no light
Front-right and center 
adrenochrome taste test this
Now you can't feel your face, nigga

The Primary Axiom,Fait Accompli,2014,"It ain't no excuse, it's the truth
We never had a chance cause the enemy's not human
Bite off more than you could chew then choke
Good and bad opportunities, I've ruined them both
What you be about, Lord? ""Aiyo, I be about Tiaamat's law
Before the Great Wall was destroyed""
Knowledge, wisdom, understanding, amnesia pre-planning
Native tribes slaughtered by cannons
Didn't wanna listen when I told you
Now you eating soy bean tofu, look what you go through
The faggot wants to be accepted, the Anti-Christ is erected
The whole world changes perspective
Khadafi had a golden gun
China got two hundred and fifty quadrillion golden tons
American confidence is waning, patriots complaining
Drones in the sky filming terrorist training
The white man's mad because the white man is selling out the white man
Now you know shit is bad
The Asian man got computers that don't subtract, they just add up
While the Arab man'll still pull the dagger
The rednecks from Santa Ana reach for their hammer
Blam, Blam, Blamma look straight into the camera
Jenny Lake, Wyoming camping, the stars are dancing
Starlight skies, Dreadnaught's commander
Homo Cobra Capensis, long pincers
Like a Mantis, early Appalachia Atlantis
Baalbek, broad shoulders, throw boulders to the four corners
When I'm around they start talking
Knuckle-dragging monkey, think he know something?
You don't know nothing, the Ironman suit was on Tussin
The nation sinks into a cesspool of sinflation
Automated Jamaican simulations, I'm stimulated
Eviscerated, well-shaven, when he's dead cremate him
Make sure you say his rhymes verbatim
I'ma put you in rehab, punch you in your fucking bean bag
And go have myself a nice steam bath
You don't want the wrath of black Charlie McGrath
I sprinkled glass on the grass before they raided my pad
Pull up the customer case while I fuck your face
Negotiate, how much does your 1099 make?
Yeah I like jogging in place, Martin Luther's speech everyday
Cause I had to have a dream anyway
Camelbak break, ice cold water on a dry lake
Not bad for a primitive primate, huh?
Dark project research manager, Canibus
In the '90s I created a neuro-sampler
Nano-nuclear waves, non-particle
You the NCO in charge of this group? Let me talk to you
Rap this, rap that, come on Canibus just rap
The whole world happy Canibus back
1000 bars plus tax, I know you love that, you little muskrats
Doing jumping jacks on the tracks
Be quiet! Something is watching us, influencing our consciousness
Falsely encouraging us, stopping us
They can't live without you, 'Bus
They said, ""We need more time."" I quietly replied, ""Time is up""
I've rhymed enough, uncoiled B-Fields
T1, 2 & 3, the Beast from the East will not yield
The time war samurai sword, pantomime record
Minds like mines not minds like yours
If language is a virus, Germaine is timeless
Simply put, Germaine is a syllable scientist
In comparison, I pale to creatures with scales, claws and tails
Laser weapons hanging off of their belts
With the wings and the eyes of an eagle
No matter the distance, they see you
Put your hands where they can see you
Read your thoughts like the NSA paralegal, power to the people
I wish I had the power to defeat you
The Hebrew has no equal, technology he has the keys to
With breakaway speeds to leave you
The pyscho psychic hypersensitive Sifu
Since the veil's too thick for human beings to see through
They don't need to let you know that they don't need you
All you need to know is that they came from Nibiru
Nimrod wants his gold and he's coming to get it
And that's why he's worshipped by the ones that collect it
I can motion vector long enough to hold that sector
I'm the protector, Hip Hop's alpha-successor
Kick your ass all over the battlefield, it was my pleasure
And we can do it again, whenever",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-primary-axiom-lyrics
Cenior Studies 02,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"Yo, the artists come and go, so does the show
So does the dough, nothing lasts forever you know
It's all about the experience and what you take from it
What you learn in the process, what you make of it
Number two in the world at the top of the summit, I loved it
Should have packed a parachute for the plummet
Now I'm opening these clips crawling through mud pits
With guns and hundreds of clips on Uncle Sam's budget
100 Rifles itself, handcuff Burt Reynolds to Jim Brown
And escape with Raquel Welch
Isn't my queen lovely? Feed her rum and raisin ice cream
Shower her with diamond rings and money
23 hours a day I study
Dreaming about beautiful women, I hate you gay Teletubbies
Dreams keep me alive you can't take them from me
The battlefield is bloody, mean and ugly
My adrenaline rushes when the enemy rush me
Trying to bust me cos I swore I'd defend my country
If I could choose between being lucky and having money
Nothing negative could ever touch me
What must be is ultimately not up to me
But I sacrifice my life for yours if you trust me
Pin my medals upon my chest
So I can left-right-left into certain death
Godspeed and God bless
In the end I hope God is impressed if I'm put to rest
I did what I came to do, no time left
Say my name out the blue cos I rhyme it the best
MicClub.net see me live in the flesh
You could come and download every rhyme that I spit
You could pay homage to Rip for one dollar a clip
None of those rhymes are on the album, bitch
It's a storage facility where I keep my shit
For the students in the class that wanna peep my shit
Break a bootlegger leg if he leak my shit
You don't wanna sign in bitch then eat my shit
Drink my piss, you could never compete like this
I'mma give you an example how deep I get
Technology not available for purchase
My brains collects, stores and converts million bar verses
At a stand-off distance of a thousand feet
I illuminate the target and pound em to sleep
To within one micro-inch if you out in the street
I could close my ears and still move my mouth to the beat
Dial-up to your network and make your files delete
Count to three, listen to your browser beat
Too late, foot already stepped in the feces
Dr. Norton's too sick to help your PCs
Virtually I make your virtual memory freeze
With a Weapon of Mass Destruction - WMD
I'm a TMC - Trouble to MCs
Destroy colonies with UCAVs
I send in no less than twenty A-Teams
Wipe you out before I even get to the beach
With my Transatmospheric spcae based mirrors
Can you write that out without typographical error?
Dumb fucks I'm the best ever whatever
Divide 18 by 6 you get the third letter
From the lowest earth orbit up to the heavens
I bomb y'all with lyrics of flesh shredders and petters forever
As a spitter I'm still tougher than leather
I had to go underground to get over the pressure
Battle rap from the Renaissance multi-megawatt
Bury you beneath the bedrock on the bed of rocks
I could never get bored
I write about 
Huxley vs Wilberforce
, fuck writing killer chorus
Copenhagen curriculum of metaphors
Everything from Bob Marley to Tenor Saul
The System of A Down song number 14
I see 'Aerials in the Sky' when I dream
The end is near I wish it would hurry up
I feel nanobacteria burning me up
Before I explain in detail
You should examine the Mahr's mineral samples under my nails
Sometimes I wonder who's listening
The auditory Pavlovian conditioning's so sickening
My adenine, guanine, cytosine
And thymine is really what makes my rhyme supreme
Soon as I hear the beat, bada-bing
You gotta think: a hundred bars...damn, that's a lotta ink
Eventually all of my albums will be out of print
There'll be a clone for every style I invent
For every line I rhyme intense
For all the time I spent, every word I spit since 96
If you could input at a hundred
I could output way above it, if we in public, I double it
Put this on your study list and go study, bitch
Basically quoting Hammer ""U can't Touch This""
I'm too assertive and alert for what its worth
My best piece of work is still yearning to be birthed

Cenior Studies from Canibus

There is something mystical, but it's not RARE
And nobody should treat it as though this is something special
That writers do... anybody--anybody born physically able in the brain
Can sit down and begin to write something and discover
That there are depths in her soul or his soul that are untapped",https://genius.com/Canibus-cenior-studies-02-lyrics
God$Les$ America,Fait Accompli,2014,"The Necronomicon got us starving like Ramadan
Standing roadside with a piece of cardboard for Chinese Yuan, c'mon
Isolate the subject from his friends family and his co workers
Minimum wage means no purchase
No job - no purpose, run around praise the lord in churches
I pray to God my old sins don't surface
The 1st Testament God gets jealous
, look at what he did to impress us, he stopped the world with a nuclear weapon
I beg him, please grant us one thousand years of peace
The East visit the West, the West visits the East
Brother should not war with brother, our ancestors were stubborn
They kicked the can down the road for nothing
The burden of being black and murdered, being whacked behind the curtain but what if you didn't really deserve it?
Doesn't matter, they want blood - no less, no more
We are consumed by war, a slave class y'all
Scraps on the table, forage for more food when I am able
So much abundance, praise 
Azazel
You have no heart, you have no conscience
Completely immoral, God bless the godless
Mud water boots drying off by the book of Genesis
A new way of life is imminent
You ain't special, they gonna get you
I ain't talking about nobody in particular, it's hypothetical
Think critical, reticle scan by sentinel
Everybody left the theatre sad but it was memorable
Cross over the border to Mexico
Pepe said, ""Yo if I was you, I would do that slow""
The Godzilla Nimrod, tomahawk look from the side
He screamed out he was from Brooklyn with pride
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
But I ain't gotta go there for me to say it that way
Black rock, tungsten padlocks, land locked
No trash box, they said it was toxic, the readings were hot
They water boarded Mos Def, woke up couldn't go back to sleep
Blacktronica lounge, Tanya and me
We danced around in shanty town wearing hand me downs
Wow, back from the war, I drink brandy now
Whiskey sour after sundown, low crawl on the ground
Got sand in my mouth, I'm in Miami now
Snapped out of it, didn't know where I was, she messed up my buzz, she don't love me but she give me massage
And no matter how bad things turn out today
When I watch her dance, it all goes away
A golden Kazakh eagle soars over Hajj
Looking down at the crowds, it was just a mirage
The tenants in the house of cards are too big to jail behind bars
Their problems too big to solve
The body cannot be free when the mind is in prison
Ears that hear are no match for ears that listen
Eyes that see are no match for eyes that see through
Yes, I am a slave and so are you
Bless, ignorance, weakness is a symptom of innocence
Pay your penance, go join the prisoners
Chemtrails, airborne spills, destroy your sense of smells
Die now, die later, heads or tails
Photovoltaic array at red dawn before that day
Exactly what I saw I cannot say
In case you haven't noticed I practice patience, focus
Freemason emotion, cold, the coldest
Pagans and their potions, kidnap you under the oceans
It's hard to believe sea monsters wear clothing
Some live in the present, some live in the future
It doesn't matter cause we all live inside a computer
I was a mobile cell phone owner, wireless station controller
It didn't help my radiation exposure
From the higgs boson fermions and protons
At this rate I will always discover more songs
Upset, bored, nothing else to do but record
Or spend time with family and get ignored
No electricity of course
Now we can all sit down at the table and be a family of four
A great new attitude on life
In spite of being loved only a little and even less liked
Find your ambitious side, the odds greatly stacked against my kind
But I still gotta try
I ain't hating on the rich and the famous, I just hate the way they played us, they never give us equal exchanges
No individuals are named, they allocate false blame
No change just more of the same
They're inspired by their desires, a steady stream of water projected between a ring of fire, a pyre of fire
The devil never compromises, the leaders were wrong
Judgement comes down from the skies and fries us all
That's why they dropped the ball",https://genius.com/Canibus-god-les-america-lyrics
Uni-4-Orm,Canibustible (Bootleg),1997,"I pulverize MC's and blow up mics

I'll run up on you and set it for no reason
My flows are like body-blows that cause internal bleeding
'Cause I'm the baddest motherfucker, above average
With alien deoxyribonucleic acid
A blood spore, with metaphors of all sorts
So fly I need a passport just to walk

What the deal, baby?
I'll set it off while my people beat you upside the head
With lead from my desert eagle
Fuck how people treat you
Ain't got no time for your feelings
On tracks I'm revealin the facts that be concealed in
A book, cause most black niggas don't read
Got me thinking bout my sister and my new-born seed
See this world is filled with idiots (What are you, and idiot?)
Illiterate, inconsiderate, motherfuckers that's kickin the illest shit

I'll let two-thirds of this nigga that's water evaporate
Then I want Jesus Christ to evacuate
Fuck pullin a nigga's card
I want the deck and the dealer
Verbal monogamy sodomy is my commodity
I see one bitch-ass nigga
Then my head blow like the Oddities
You emtpy T.V., I empty MC (Nigga)
Record industry rule numers one, two, and three
Jews run it, niggas run around in it, believe me

But I know my shit
Your style is small, that makes me wonder like that robot bitch
Yo, watch this

You get popped in the face like you're throwin fries up in hot grease
Rockness rips straight through toys
Got rappers jumpin through car windows like they Duke Boys
I told ya, this east-west is bullfit like a Pablo's
Philly's wherever I go until I blow trial, yo

Canibus remains undisputed but never rooted
I'm strong enough to throw a bullet faster than a gun can shoot it
So if you try to battle me face-to-face
I'll bring your career to a stop quicker than anti-lock brakes
Look (look) inside the mind of a animal
That'll beat you to death with a bar of soap wrapped in a towel
And while you niggas is babblin'
My lyrics is travelin' like a javelin
To stab you in the abdomen

When we thump, your knees bump like a Kerrigan
The veteran, better than sick crews
Take your medicine, I can vic you
From the crib'll let him in
Keep your locks on
Son, I think the plot's on (With who?)
With the baby girl, yo, the bitch said her pop's gone (For real?)
Proceed to creep, du
There's no need to sleep, du, I'm nocturnal
Don't care about my where abouts, nigga, it don't concern you

I got nigga's heads dividin faster than nerds at a calculus convention
See I school niggas, then I after-school niggas like detention
It's a cinch to bag bitches now
But I remember they was dissin when I was broke, I was good for nothing
Now I'm good for nuttin down them bitche's throats (Uh-huh)
Like Rock say (You'll get the bobway...)
So just say when
You got anything to get off your chest besides yo chin
This nigga spit like I was teething
Fuckin up more human beings than Europeans

Dutch boy, guard yo leg like I'm Barkley
Don't start me
I'll pull Sparsky
He'll rip apart three of you in a heart beat
In the dark we see like owls, bats, vampires
In a large tree
Ready to snipe that ass at warp speed
Launch torpedos
MC's know what they weak flows
We float and bounce on tracks like a goddamn speed boat
So slow yo ass down, no doubt
Don't be hasty face me
Or you'll be jettin diesel
Bench-pressin daisys

I'm the greatest scientifically inclined mind since Einstein

Tryin' to shine with the shit I invent
I know I ain't perfect, but I'm 99.9 percent
Which means I represent
And get deep in thoughts with philosophies
Like a rolling stone gathers no moss
At any and all costs, M.C.'s get flipped, ripped, split
And tossed with lyrical brute force, of course
Y'all niggas is microsoft like DOS
Fuckin' wit' me you'll catch a free round trip to the morgue
Cause I ain't scared of none of y'all

We can go to war, with four-four's, or swashbuckle with swords
Intoxicated off the La-La, on some Rah-Rah

Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the Blah-Blah-Blah!!!

Yet, he makes perfect sense mathematically
I happily accept any rapper's offer to challenge me
Fifty M.C.'s reduced to forty nine casualties
I'll be the last man standin'

Nitrogen lungs yo my tongue mix propane with spit
And I'm nice, the voice of Christ resurrected through mics
Son of God, Son of Man helping some of y'all to overstand
Crash the Vatican as soon as I land
I'm 'bout to set it on man in the gulf of Adan
I stand in the Garden of Eden, unbeaten, undefeated
I tweeted pictures of Eve tonguing cheeses
Scientology guides put my rhymes on photography slides
To quantify the higher knowledge applied
But I'm an uncaged animal channeling Hannibal
A cannibal, bite your head off and hand it to you
SpitBoss, centrifugal force different from yours
Sun is Born, this is Lyrical Law, Yo!!!

I've never been a friendly author, don't need a gangster beat to make me off ya
I'll slaughter ya while playing Cyndi Lauper
Better than y'all, give me one competitive brawl
I throw a hundred miles an hour with a medicine ball
I melt your fortress down to caramel softness
Drive a charger through ya torso, parallel parking
That cosmic ray beam effect, I Hiroshima wreck
Rap disaster so tragic they gave his ass a FEMA check
Cadence is radiant, I predated Arcadians
I stayed with the brigade of alien ectosapiens
Hit your through the atrium of heavenly light
Once I smite you, like a left arm you'll never be right
I've used every word possible to let you know what I can do
So I made something new, I'll collipherously clobber you
You ain't legitimate, you posing like a model
Dude I'll throttle you, liquidate and sixteen ounce bottle you

I'm tryna figure out who this nigga barking at
Before his heart gets snatched, run up on him in a stocking cap
Keep barking like you hard, get stalked and clapped
Come in the cage you get stomped on the mat
Carve your name in the axe, then chop you in the back
Hack off your femur bones, beat you with them like bats
Put your remains in some saran wrap, dump them in an alcohol vat
You can rap but you ain't all that
Step inside, close the door, fuck you yawning for?
Kick your head off, now it's rolling on the floor like a bowling ball
Open the door, clean this fucking mess off my wall
And don't ever mention his name no more
You dig, you follow me nigga, I follow you quicker
You got a weak ticker, told you not to fuck with the Ripper
Now you showing your true colours, drinking blood from ya liver
You a dickrider and you an Indian giver
Waging war with some gorillas, I'll bludgeon you by the river
The bar range is pissing he gon' find you while you fishing
Fistula face, herpes simplex outbreak
Alienated aliens get ate by alien apes
You food nigga, throw yourself over the gate
How does alien taste? Like mammalian waste
If you ain't swift you's a dumb fuck
I'll have you breathing like your lungs got struck by 200 pound nunchucks
Brave motherfuckers get slayed for Hip Hop if you love it
Like Kill Bill between a hundred gay lovers
I'm the illest nigga say something, yeah I thought so
Shut the fuck up things will go back to normal
I ain't happy though, now I'm in battle mode
The president of Hip Hop with mad motherfuckers on the grassy Knoll
I take it back to my Curriculum days
What you say? I body you in meticulous ways
Cos you thought I was a donut, you tried to glaze
Let me tell you something, don't pop shit fistula face
Battle league nigga, talking shit's for amateurs nigga
Goddammit, y'all living off fantasies, nigga
You wanna battle that bad, aight go get your camera
When it's my turn, I got a four and a half pound answer
When I was young, I took down hard targets
You a sausage nigga, for coming at me like a novice
You never heard Fraternity of the Impoverished'?
Motherfucker, can't you see that I'm an artist
I don't want them childish problems
Lyrical manslaughter charges interfere with my Lyrical Law process
Out rap me, that's preposterous
Metaphor marksman mudswamping, we hunt down Hip Hop monsters
Skin 'em alive tie their carcass to the bottom of my Polaris
And drive them all the way to Wisconsin
Partner, fuck around throw your ass under the bus face down
Lay down, we gon' wait for this greyhound
The fuck you gonna say now?
Do me a favor, stop weighing me down
Fucking clown, Lyrical Law is too muscle bound
Houdini style nigga, just struggle and drown
Get it over with, you can never fuck with my style
You got raped nigga, you bleeding, don't touch my towel
Spit them wack juice punchlines all you want
But don't front, bottom line, I'm a champ, you a chump
You can spit your stupid punchlines all you want
But after this the whole world gon' see who won

Knowledge this, knowledge this
The vocalist beast, knowledge like the Pope in this piece
You think the ocean is deep? Fuck with me!
Unbelievable bars, unbeatable odds
Unspeakable horrors at a unperceivable cost
Your unagreeable response lacks thought and human heart
This is Lyrical Law, it's what I make the music for
My prayers are simple, my forehead is layered with wrinkles
Because of all the hardships that I've been through
Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious
Fringe politics got the public thinking the opposite
I'm a hypo-lyrical spontaneous alchemical
Elite neo-liberal child of the indigo
Drilling holes through the Faraday cages of your brains
Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine
High lyrical exponent intelligence quotient
When I'm focused I can engage multiple opponents
But I won't if, I have no motive, ""Soldier be careful, it's loaded!""
Verbose with emotions of psychosis
In case you didn't notice when I wrote it
I'm spitting lyrics fitting in tighter spaces than outer-space roaches
A real emcee don't have to do what he don't wanna do
And that includes freestylin' in front of you
It's not like something gone change
It's not like the whole world gone start praising my name- I stay in my lane
I'd rather die by living brave then live like a slave
I'd rather be broke then be fake and get paid
These layers of physicality challenge me
My soul is gold and it's the only thing that's able to balance me
My energy body has a alchemical copy that looks godly
Not fat, out of shape or sloppy
The iller the rhymes the more that I embody
Vilified when real recognize real - I gets mines
Stand with the underdog - don't be a coward
Stop dickriding people for their money and power!
Even the American flag says 'Made in China'
The national debt says the US is a vagina
Of a black widow spider spraying blood out like a geyser
Why do we lose everything we fight for?
Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters
In the land of the lawless, sacrificed before Horus
The Inca, the Aztecs, the Mayans, were masters
A new beginning is coming - the irony is classic
The potential of life versus the potential of death
Either way you go through mad mental stress
God forbid for you, for her, or him
We ignored the gems now we gotta do it all again
We failed Hip Hop's laws and brought down shame upon our cause
Now we will fall upon our swords
The Shaman pays homage to Solomon
He orders them to send the witchdoctor in, then asked me to rhyme again
Every now and then I get retarded and spit
I would like to apologize to every artist I dissed
Everybody assumes that I wanna rhyme when I don't
Sometimes I just wanna chill and watch you flow
Mysteries of the cathedral, the dark overlords are evil
Ripped out the vocal cords of the people
I walk up to your bed side in disguise with red eyes
And tell you to remember these rhymes
This is the season of Hip Hop, believe it or not
I lined it up with the planet's equinox",https://genius.com/Canibus-fraternity-of-the-impoverished-lyrics

Kriminal Kindness,Melatonin Magik,2010,"Yo, I've been dealing with hate since 1998
I punished the industry by dominating mixtapes
None of y'all can stop the onslaught of those bars
Rainfall and fireballs fell from the stars
The speech pattern of God, 
I ripped off weak rappers jaws
Whoever ignored Lyrical Law
Hip Hop didn't understand it at all, they couldn't manage my thoughts
So I retreated to the land of the lost
Don't talk about beats, talk about bars
Canibus so raw that rejection is your only response
Give a fuck if I sell one unit
Cause that was never the motivation for me to do this, stupid
I've already proved it
Now I must prepare for my posthumous interview with the vampire druids
That are coming to relieve me of my fluids
Believe me I'm the truest, that's why they can't stop my music

The coming casteless slave society
Obviously the government lied to me
The Illuminati's kidnap of Hip Hop is plain to see
Dead or alive you heard it from the Can-I-B

Yo, I will not forsake the light, you can not force me to fight
I will always pay the ultimate price
Whether I am wrong or whether I am right
I've been a martyr all of my life, my archetype talks to the mic
I eat emcees on behalf of Iron Mike
I'm a fireball of the night, an extra-terrestrial airstrike
Call me on Skype tonight, we can talk if you like
I denounce fear like Steven Greer and his wife
Subject matter sound barely connected
Even when it's understood, it's rarely respected
The evidence is staring directly at the detective
Alex Jones left me a message saying I won't be accepted
Now, who's the skeptic?
The Melatonin Magik Deception
I will never be available for questions, get the fuck out my session
I've learned my lesson, media suppression is a weapon
They fucked up Hip Hop's progression

Yes
Melatonin Magik, Melatonin Magik
Melatonin Magik, Melatonin Magik

How many emcees must get dissed
Before somebody whispers, ""don't fuck with Bis?""
My Survival Skills surpass Kris, watch this
You got a rap for every emcee? Go get it, then!
Why you dickride Def Jam? They not your friend
Make your mind up, I thought you was not with them?
Fucking comedy, speaking on flawed philosophies
You'll never give props to Keith and Canibus for Undergods release
Go right ahead, dismiss it
We ain't submissive, we spit lyrical lyrics
I got the right of to live off it, I live it
And I'ma voice my opinion, can't nobody make me think different
My spirit feels like it's in a prison
I speak on the music conspiracy but nobody wanna listen
I talked about this shit years ago
I told my family if they kill us don't be scared to go",https://genius.com/Canibus-kriminal-kindness-lyrics
Drama A/T,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"Executive Order 11002
The reason you know me but I don't know you
You really wanna know what drama is let me show you
But keep in mind this is just one point of view
Drama is livin' in a 3rd world country
Fucked up and hungry without no money
Drama is trying to adjust to circumstance
Missing more than one leg or more than one hand
Drama is being chased off ya' land
By a funny looking man in a suit that works for the bank
Drama is what's happening to the ecosystem
And the animals it feeds, from the damage to trees
To rainforests that get destroyed annually
Damn is it just me who cares about the air that we breathe?
Drama is the nuclear threat that we live with
One bomb and everybody's dead that's some sick shit
Drama is HIV statistics
The infected person that you might have sex with, life goes on
But drama is living with the afterthought that maybe you could have prevented it
Drama is imminent, it comes in other forms
The sick pedophiles who support child porn
Never mind the offenders
Think about what the victims go through and what the fuck they gotta' live wit
Drama is the prison population
Some belong there but also some belong on probation
Drama is not being able to change one thing
Cause the system you live in says you ain't shit
Drama is corporate scandal
Drama is a handful of CEO's playin' you for a damn fool
Drama is being a millionaire
But gotta' recoup half the budget from your 10 percent share
Drama is having one too many women
Even though you always need a spare one to swim in
Drama is dealing with your jealous impulses
Learning how to hold it all in with no emotion
Drama is blind devotion
Drama is having your deepest secrets exposed in the open
Drama is having your heart broken
And the person who broke it doesn't even motherfucking notice
Drama is trying to carry a burden all by yourself on your shoulders and it don't exist
Drama is being falsely accused, Drama is the latest news
Drama is what gives people clues
Drama is a tool you can use to distract ya' enemy so they never improve
Drama is the fear of devils and the fear of God
Drama is a long and hard Tech support desk job
Drama is the life of an up-and-coming actor or rapper
Or athlete or building contractor
Drama is a rookie cop calling for backup
The 3 strike perpetrator that's getting tatted up
Drama is the spin zone of a politician
Drama is K-Solo when he said the rhyme did it
Drama is the struggle of change
Drama is inevitable there is no other way
Drama is what drains life force out of you
Drama is negative but drama can empower you
Drama is love, Drama is pain
Drama exists in everything everyday
Drama is the Yin, Drama is the Yang
Drama is the innate nature of man
Drama contracts, Drama expands
Drama is what I am

Pull up a chair to the aristocracy of commonwealth prophecy
The legacy of generation three isosceles
Logical geometry, illogical melodies
Integrated with memories that mix melodically
Beyond the insight of what a modern-day monkey sees
Get chopped in three for pathetic hypocrisy
False bureaucracy breeds poetic monopolies
Chateau de Trevano is my property
An addict for drama and dramatic oddities
Addicted to bottles of sticky green botany
In a reflection of the split seas you see me in 3D
Tripping off three hits of E
Half-a-tablet for you 2-and-a-half for me
A rappers speech is slurred for eternal depravity
Naturally ignore gravity project astrally
Ascend gradually till the stratosphere passes me
Earth's actually esoterically absent to me
Take a crack at me with blurred clarity - battle me
Spiders crawl outta the skin the six headed beast
Evil beings that wrestle with demons in the deep
Useless to eat 200 pounds of rotten meat
Shrink heads drink black milk collect black teeth
Luminati tribal chief wear it as trophy piece
My women are ornamented with a blood soaked wreath
Like Christmas minus Christ plus the heat
The Ascended Master, leader of all immortal freaks
Voodoo curse on your last and future release
Unleash the worst plague put the world under siege
Till your name is unheard and your face is unseen
Till your just a nightmare of an accursed dream
Tell the supreme to curse your whole team and your unborn seed
Poison your queen like the Furher's last week
In the blood filled streets you're a leech
Less than a man a poverty stricken thief with grief
At night you speak to Satan before you go to sleep
Worshiping the flesh like poor pagan priests
Your future's oblique
I command your heart to seize its beat
Thou shall inherit disease, drama and defeat...

(Blood spillin in the streets!)
(Blood spillin in the streets!) The what?
(Blood spillin in the streets!)

Uhh, yo, yo, aiyyo
Aiyyo wit two precise niggas, holdin the right biscuits
There'll be a lot of cats leakin out they life liquid
Niggas who actin hard this ain't Columbia Pictures
When we throw two in yo' ass while you huggin on your mistress
From Philly, where cats quick to mute you at
Cuckoo cats, twist back your FUBU cap
Crucial black - two chicks to screw you at
Then they shove a poolstick where you doodoo at
While you checkin on your pagers, weapons in your faces
Shot blazin, cops section off the pavement
Hoppin out with gauges, prepare for the occasion
We throw about eight in, the house that you was raised in
Mouthin off fakin'll make you a loud patient
Achin, with your arms in a alcohol basin
And while your brain's achin I'mma have your dame slavin
Cocaine and apron, over a flame bakin

 Niggas take it for granted -
Until they layin dead on the granite
 Innocent bystanders get shot by standin
 Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon
 or y'all be checkin for leaks -
Niggas'll leave your blood spillin in the streets

Can you feel it? Nothin can save ya
Cause this is the season of the infrared laser
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is show you how you can get spotted by one too
Cause I don't give a fuck, I just cock back and bust
With more arms than an octopus, as if one gun wasn't enough
I fuck around and pull eight out
Blast your face off or blow your brains out
Nigga, I'll leave you laid out
Then I pull the gat in my waist out
Put it in your mouth
And keep squeezin til the whole clip is sprayed out
Take the gun in my ankle brace out
Shoot you in the stomach 'till I see the last meal you ate drain out
Your face look spaced out, I gut you like a trout
Scream my name out while I'm scrapin your rib cage out
Squeeze with the index, spray like a bottle of Windex
Bullets buzzin by your head like insects
From your head to your mid-sec'
And I ain't even shoot you in the legs or your limbs or your dick yet
Your masculinity is questionable, you probably a homosexual
Just the thought of havin a woman lay next to you
Probably threatens you
You probably look at grapes and see testicles
You probably fantasize about vegetables
Like cucumbers and bananas havin sex with you
And you probably let gerbils crawl up your rectum too
Shame on you; I (*defecate*) on you
And simultaneously (*urinate*) on you
And pour some acid rain on you
I stop your heartbeat with heat
You weak nigga, I'll leave your blood spillin in the street

 Niggas take it for granted -
Until they layin dead on the granite
 Innocent bystanders get shot by standin
 Y'all better duck when you hear the cannon

 Ayyo Journalist what you workin with?
 Old school burners with
Barrels big enough for you head to fit in the circle shit
What you holdin Canibus?
 30 bullet banana clips
Just to handle the kick I gotta glue it to my hands and shit
We got permits to murder shit
We critically injure niggas who deserve the shit
Put em in a tourniquet
 Bomb-proof Suburbans with tractor-tread tires
So we can ride through the dirt with it (drive over curbs with it)
Merc in it, even over slippery surfaces we can swerve in it
(And crash into niggas who don't deserve they shit)
Try stoppin the dudes, you gotta be bruised
Cockin the tools that knock you out your socks and your shoes
 We'll leave you shoeless and keep shootin
Look how much life liquid you losin
You need a blood transfusion
 In the back of a medic truck, shots in your neck and gut
While we holdin our weapons up, I'm still reppin' Philly - what?

(Blood spillin in the streets!)
(Blood spillin in the streets!) The what?

What’s Going On,Can-I-Bus,1998,"""What's.. what's..""
""What's going on? What's going on?"" (4X)

The club scene is a regular hangout spot for unclean
Women in tight jeans frontin like queens
Chickenheads who should be home takin care of their eggs
Instead, they always in the club flirtin with men
No I don't care about no hype-no-holic bitches; all I'm concerned with
Is who's bringin they burners in to burn niggas
While security practices mediocre precautions
Niggas is still stealthily sneakin they firearms in
Often, niggas be acting like they're marksmen
But couldn't hit a stationary object
So how you gonna hit a movin target? Especially if you alcoholic
The party was coconuts until you spoiled it
Nigga what's goin on?
Chorus: Canibus + samples
""What's going on? What's going on?""
 What's goin on these days?
 Can't do no hip-hop shows without the gunplay
""What's going on? What's going on?""
 What's goin on? Why is everybody packin?
""While you rappin, I'm busy tryin to sneak the gat in"" -] Havoc
""What's going on? What's going on?""
 What's goin on these days?
Can't do no hip-hop shows without the gunplay
""What's going on? What's going on?""
 Before you blaze, think about the lives at stake
""You got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place"" -] Biggie

Aiyyo
The other night I seen some kid gettin loud, runnin his mouth
Til somebody pulled the thang-thang out, then shots rang out
This nigga in front of me got his back blown out
On the floor with a piece of his small intestines hangin out
I had to scream on the bouncers to carry him out
They said, ""Nah, them niggas is still bustin in the crowd""
Then they ducked down close to the ground as the bullets whizzed by
Prayin to Allah cause they don't wanna die
But neither do I, fuck it, I gotta be here
As a rap artist, it's a vital part of my career
I swear, y'all niggas need to chill with that
Bringing your handguns to every God damn club I perform at
Everything from semi-autos to macs
Chrome or black, plastic gats and all that
Believe it or not - the government wants that
So they can use that as an excuse to shut down rap
What's goin on?
Chorus

Yo
All of my hip-hop niggas should feel what I'm speakin upon
A subject that was touched by Nas and Pharoahe Monch
Bullets - bein shot from guns, guns bein carried by thugs
Who come to the clubs to shed blood
Bear in mind, that everytime a nigga reaches for chrome
He jeopardizes more lives than his own
To some this record ain't even relevant until you experience
How a bullet can shatter your dreams in a millisec'
By some thug cats who didn't take that
By bustin a gat, they could render somebody handicapped
And trapped, in a wheelchair over nothin
With the gift of walkin and runnin snatched from them
What the fuck is goin on?
Chorus 2X (to fade)",https://genius.com/Canibus-whats-going-on-lyrics
Let’s Ride,Can-I-Bus,1998,"If you just listen to my lyrics every day for a couple of weeks
My techniques will eventually kill you just like red meat
The Bhagavad Gita beliefs I speak be so deep
Most critics get mad because there's nothing to critique
Whenever I'm rapping or rhyming with irrefutably remarkable timing
I'm like Charlie Chaplin pantomiming
If you John Blaze, or you James Flames
Or you Jack Cremation, I'm Germaine Propane (Germaine Propane)
No pain no gain in this rap game
For the fortune and fame in order to remain
Most real MC's learn to adapt to the change
Or get washed away like tears in the rain, in the rain y'all

Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
(When you in the streets and you're drivin in your V
If you can see what I see, you're prepared for the jackers)
+Old school, old school+
{????Everybody got to pack a mac now}????

Yo, if you wanna know, how I kick a flow
When I rip a show, with my lyrical, I'm a let you know
It's difficult, cause I'm a part spiritual, part para-physical miracle
And I'm a blackout in a minute too
Spittin like Bone-Thugs like
""Nigga-what? I'm-fin-to-get-a-gun and stick-em-up""
Then crush a Thug's Bones with a chrome slug
The black Cyrano De Bergerac of rap
With the ghetto Anglo-Sax' poetic syntax
In fact, nigga don't even give me dap when I see you
Just don't give me no ice grill eye contact either
When you see me, whylin' like Beenie on the speakers
""Sim Simma-- who got the fire for my reefa?""

Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
(When you in the streets and you're drivin in your V
If you can see what I see, you're prepared for the jackers)
+Old school, old school+
{????Everybody got to pack a mac now}????
 You came home from a bid a nigga was in your crib
And the whole time you thought your girl was celebate
 Old school old school
 You locked up and she need some di-ick
 Just ride, just ride, ah just ride e'rybody just ride
Just ride in the hood, just ride, all my .. uh, ah just ride

Yo physically I move at a velocity
That'll break your stopwatch if you clockin me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji
Iller than what you seen in the cinema
A five-foot-eight nigga
With more horsepower than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin Pentium chips
Double the clock speeds of a 586
And nothin about my physical matrix is BASIC
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin
You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes
It's like a Jamaican seein the snow for the first time
Rhymes of a sort, that distort space and time
It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind

Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride
(When you in the streets and you're drivin in your V
If you can see what I see, you're prepared for the jackers)
+Old school, old school+
{????Everybody got to pack a mac now}????
 Crimes on the street, come from a lack of eatin
It's not my cup of tea, but I'll give them the BEST
Motherfuckin BEST
And if you still out here I kick yo' ass tomorrow
 Old school, old school (c'mon!)
 And if you still out here, I kick yo' ass tomorrow
 Old school, old school (c'mon y'all)
 Frontin like you buyin food but you buyin crack bottles

Hype-Nitis,Can-I-Bus,1998,"The hype-nitis, is in your eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

Aiyyo can you feel it?
I know that everyone has heard of that (Vapors)
But this is the '98 version of that
Biz Mark, one of the founders of this art
Discovered evidence of the disease and documented it
Now the name of the virus is called Hype-Nitis
A terminal condition that affects all biters and liars
Hype-naholics can't require my respect
Cause they snakes
And I could smell the venom on their breaths
Hype-Nitis

The hype-nitis, is in your eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

Alright now, I'ma break the Hype-Nitis down
It's characterized by a certain type of lifestyle
People that treated you foul just wanna be nice now
Smile and raise they eyebrows when you come around
I remember when I first started to work
And tried to get this job as a label intern
Them niggas was killing me, 'cuz wasn't nobody feeling me
A & R's wouldn't even risk demo dealing me

Hype (Can you believe that shit)
Nitis (That's how it was back then)
Is in you eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

I know most the niggas I exchange pounds with and lounge with
Wouldn't be around if my career was spiraling downward
They crowd around me til I'm surrounded
Ask me who I'm down with
Til I replied ""the Navy SEALS outfit""
They told me my album was coconuts so they rewound it
I knew they was hype-naholics by how they voices sounded
I pulled a silver can out of my trousers
Made a public announcement
About the Hype Juice and then I bounced kid

The Hype-Nitis, is in your eyes
That look, that smile, in disguise

To me Hype-Nitis is like the measles cause it's a disease too
Studies show it infects one in every five people
It's so lethal the cure can't be achieved hypodermic needles
Or the ingestion of medicine in teaspoons
If you feel the need to
Here's a toll-free number
They'll send you an 8 page pamphlet to read through
800-7932, there'll be available
Hypenoholics standing by for you to speak to

Sinflation,Fait Accompli,2014,"Today, tomorrow, six months, next year
They have always held the keys to your fears
Fast-forward, decades later, blood, sweat and tears
Are shed to the creator, but it was all made-up
Generation after generation, tell me what changes
History keeps repeating itself for ages

He was driving a Tesla model S playing loud music
He drove into an EMP storm and got electrocuted
Trust fund lawyers were recruited, lawsuits were instituted
“The electric car killed him”; prove it!
Quantum evolution quantum conducive
Quantum revolution rap music quantum electrocution
Transformed him into a mutant, infrared eyesight lucid
Sharpen the picture, fine-tune it or lose it
God’s gift, optic oculus rift; look around your environment
But keep your composure, now what do you think?
I think it’s all gone to shit; these problems can’t be fixed
I think the only solution is reset
They say comply or die, regroup on your side
Or mine and stop making excuses about why
Keep an eye on the micro, but notice the macro
The bottom line is our slave masters are assholes

Today, tomorrow, six months, next year
They have always held the keys to your fears
Fast-forward, decades later, blood, sweat and tears
Are shed to the creator, but it was all made-up
It ain’t today, tomorrow, six months, or next year
They enjoy playing off of all our fears
Fast-forward, decades later, blood, sweat and tears
Are shed to the creator, we don’t worship no paper

Preach, the higher the peak, the lower we are forced to dig deep
The best outcome is always out of reach
Do you agree to disagree about hope? ‘Course you don’t
Believe everything they see, you’ll never see through the smoke
You say you know the ledge, that’s just a theoretical edge
To make the world a better place you need more than a pledge
Trust no one, even yourself
And this includes the person giving, receiving or needing some help
But you sold them your soul and they stretched out your donut hole
You only know what you were told, not what you behold
The collapse is simultaneously triggered
Now you know what it feels like to be a statistic
Poor sons of bitches ain’t allowed to make decisions
We’re middle-class midgets living off of Third World figures
They say the economy’s grown
But if you look there’s more vacant homes than homeless people living on the road


You stop getting chances when you stop taking them
So just follow your orders, never question who’s making them
“Let us hold hands, let us pray with him”; excuse me, what’s your name again?
“Okay, we’ll have another round of Jameson
Drink up, rejoice, let’s pretend we always have a choice
Cause we sure as hell never had a voice”
The day of reckoning, your last will and testament
Text-messaging emergency services still testing pings
Black Swan psychologists could’ve been worse, they could’ve been communists
Objection sustained, McCarthyism, counselor
A complete monopoly, this is proper Hip-Hop verbosity
Show you how it be and how it look to me
They build, destroy, recycle, that’s how they get it done
Vocal percussions, no interruptions, perfection
Soundproof coffins, the haunted eavesdrop too often
It’s always me and the Lord when I’m talking
Taking long walks on winter beaches falling
With splinters and blisters and the sound of whispering torment
The guillotines are sharpening, their background music is ominous
Laying there naked dying from insomnia
Hungry ‘cause they’re starving us, gun sentries, hall monitors
Droning and daunting, my dear long-armed darlings
We are death-marching, ritual, sinister, barefoot prisoners
Dig a hole so POWs can shit in it
Prisoners during peacetime, peaceful and primitive
We never could understand, what the fuck is a derivative?
Admit it: we were all deceived with such relative ease
Only because we dared to dream
They stole control with a single act of multiple hacks
They were literal, visceral, non-physical attacks
City-wide but then the chaos metastasized to the countryside
We cried, our Bill of Rights were nullified
So miserable, so sad, I don’t ever think I’ve felt this bad
Feelings are emotions, emotions are scams
Wealth intimidates poor people more than violence
So they hide it, I’ve been on both sides of the fence
The common man changed to behave as a slave
Reading Elliott waves in a daze on a Forex page

"Father Author, Poor Pauper",For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"Yea, Father Author, Poor Pauper, Yea
(More than a microphone monster)

Once a upon a midnight dreary
Being blackballed by the music industry prepared me
In the past albums were made, put on the shelf
I was never paid or given a wealth
Who can I blame but myself? No one
I followed my azimuth then transit on a path from apprentice to master
My testimony any place at the top is lonely
Ask me what I cherish mostly, no matter what I say is poetry
The way I walk, the way I talk, the way I fought
The way I won, the way I lost, the way I thought
When they tried to play me out as a man
The way it felt takin' showers in the sand with a fuel can
Wakin' up in the middle of the night
I can't breathe right, I can feel my heart beat spike
Father Author, Poor Pauper use to be a war monger
I promised the Lord I will not tour any longer
Pardon the The Poor Pauper with nothin' to offer from his coffer
Coughin' up a mouthful of a volcanic sulfur
Feast your eyes on the awesome mechanics of the metallic saucers
Flown by man, I bet you thought it was the Martians
Since Channel Zero I tried to do somethin' to save you
But you threw away the jewels I gave you
When you're ready to move to the mountains it'll be too late too
That's why I pray for you
My words appear clear but true meanin' is lost
Why would an emcee like that even talk?
Clear your mind, clear your thoughts
Throw away everything you bought
And kneel before the Ark
YOU DON'T! You knew you should but you won't
Any artist will become lethargic from weed smoke
I don't go to malls cause I don't like shoppin'
I can't buy clothes when the mannequins are watchin'
Overspecialization doesn't require special explanation
The information is my interpretation
I sit down at the table and make it
Through a series of musical, lyrical and compositional arrangements
I'm disinfatuated, you rappers are overrated
For the music you're makin', it sounds foolish and basic
Thread by thread the poem is woven, the book is open
You were ordered to show him, than the words are spoken
Civilization is fragile, so is life there in battle
So is nature when surrounded by the unnatural
Walk through the doors of Langley Headquarters
My logo is in the floor etched in marble
Behind the rose line, morals and dogma of rhymes
That climb one of three peaks of Mount Hermon there in my lifetime
The rhymes is 3 point 1 4 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9
Same morning that the Can-I-Bus album came out
I got a text from The NSA that said ""They'd take me out""
Kabbalah Math was all I had
My wife and child were both killed in a helicopter crash
Eight months passed, I'm in Walter Reed with a rare fungus rash
I told them ""Fuck the cash"" Just give me somethin' for the pain
My brain 'bout to bust vein
They said ""You've been through enough Germaine""
I tried to sit up but can't get up
This sucks, Father Author, Poor Pauper can't give up
The Biomarker lit up; the labtec took the blood that I spit up
She tried to screen it, than clean it
Hydroxide radicals I couldn't believe it
I was the Anemic Heathen that was saved by the blood of Jesus
My only grievance is I never be the same again
Never be able to rhyme like it was '98 again
I'm so ashamed I'm depressed; I don't know what I could say to them
So I made this mixtape for them
I hope you enjoy it even if you never bought it
This is Father Author, Poor Pauper last recording",https://genius.com/Canibus-father-author-poor-pauper-lyrics
Shove This Jay-Oh-Bee,Office Space (OST),UnKnown,"Mmm, Yeah

Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning
To the sound of your alarm clock alarming
About an hour from now
You should be at the place of employment
Which is annoying cause it's so boring
Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them
It affects your occupational performance
You wonder why your workload is so enormous
Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office
People get depressed, they get ulcers
From the stress that the corporate environment causes
Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this
Seems to me like you've got one of four choices:
You could take a new job, offer for more chips
Stick it out a little longer, or forfeit
But my advice to anybody that wants to quit
It'll feel much better if you say it like this:

Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it

Yo, if your boss is a S-O-B
Tell him to S-H-O-V-E the J-O-B
Put your middle finger up slowly
Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely
Say I ain't workin here no more
Who do you think you are?
Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor
Run to the door, to the payphone
Make a toll-free call
Tell your spouse what happened and where you are
So they can come and get you in the car later on
And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job
If the unemployment line ain't that long
You can take your time printin out 
W-9 forms
Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough
And you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough
Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it
But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to

Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it

Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs
The boss's favorites get placed in something spacious
While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces
Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated
You constantly waitin for a paycheck
Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet
Here's a optimistic motto
If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow
Most 9 to 5's are hard
Cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park
People get hired
Drink coffee to stay wired
So they don't get tired, sleep late, and get fired

You came in late, you already ate
Nowww, you wanna take a lunch break!??!

Ay, yo bust it, ain't no need to discuss it
Just take this job and shove it, right between your buttocks
 x2
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it

Layered Prayers,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"Yea, ayo Mother Earth absorbs the blood I bleed
Hip-Hop is my blood - I believe
That I am not free, and neither are you
The only time I feel free is when I'm rhyming in the booth
The Lion on the loose is not a reckless recluse
But really a dictator with his neck in a noose
For war crimes; Hardcore rhymes from a warped mind
That enjoyed the dark matter in the void before time
The innocent murmured, murdered because they worshipped him
They let the serpent in but it never occurred to them
The deity regards emcees like me
Piously, check the degree, see if it's me
On planet Earth I design mankind's rebirth
A marvel of water and rock salt from a verse
The Moon, the Sun and the Stars
I am who you are, together, we all form God
I laugh at the creation of it, the explanation of it
Not the original but man's imitation of it
They took Hip-Hop and changed the subject
Then I brought Hip-Hop back and made you love it
Through deterrence, detention and prevention
Never write the wrong sentence
If I ever said it I meant it
The insatiable, inescapable regiment
What's the weight? Add four more plates, I bench it
Skinny-ass nigga, grab your neck with a pen-grip
Bend it through telepathic suggestion
I rap so serious, the vocal myriad
Occurred intermittently over protracted periods
Rap 'til you get delirious, wack niggas get furious
Keep dissin' me, your girl's gettin' curious
Darth Vader on the cross-fader releasin' the raw data
This is called hard jaw-breaker labour
When I see you I'mma battle you, then tackle you
Then grapple you, then probably snap you in two
Yo, ain't that the truth?, outside the booth
Air combat maneuvers without no computer
Space wings that cause pings MOTHAFUCKA!!!
We gon' dogfight above cloud cover
High in the friendly skies, where unfriendlies lie
Where friendlies and unfriendlies die
You and I race to the Sun, I just got back
The race is done, ages have ended and ages have begun
Cognizance saturation, I am the one
Tell me where chain-gun Germaine came from?
Dara-I-Suf, the river of caves
My ribcage look like miniature shin blades
When I bathe in the waters below
Still waters run deep, King Cthulhu told me so
Magna-dome under Yellowstone inside the bowels of the Earth
I'mma show you the power of the verse
Cause man cannot establish dominance over man
Indefinitely; man only respects God's energy
Telluric energy, drawn from the bowels of the Earth
I'mma show you the power of the verse
Telluric energy, drawn from the bowels of the Earth
I'mma show you the power of the verse",https://genius.com/Canibus-layered-prayers-lyrics
Lunar Deluge,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"Lets see if you can follow this rhyme
Follow this rhyme with your mind

I woke up into a dream, a dream that was more real than it seemed
With no animation or green screen
Human beings need special specs provided by special request
To see the spectacular special effects
If you can see what I saw or hear what I heard
Your ears will not need to hear the sound of my words
My thoughts follow my feelings, that is how I think
The sceptics are rarely convinced, their feelings are exempt
What is the point of thought if you can not control the result
What is it worth? If anything at all
Where do we exist from? What do we exist for?
We were intelligently designed to be a resource
How can there be free will without the freedom to feel?
We pursue an illusion that isn't real
P-12 psychics taking red pills to produce thrills
Then predicting a coin toss a hundred times to prove skill
Telekinetic electro-genetic psionic weapon
With extra-sensory perception of precognitive method
That's why I can rhyme with consistence
Indisputable evidence repeatable on the street or in a studio session
I am sorry if you feel I am refusing your questions
That's not my intention, my mind is in a higher dimension
At these levels I have much higher attention
Ascension into a level of rhyming defined as divine intervention
My intent to present the most intensive lung splitting
Tongue twisting sentence ever historically recorded to present
But that is not the point of this lesson
I will continue this poetic expression, you must listen to make the connection
I will slow down
Now take a deep breath and try to get with the flow now, this is it
Back to the beginning when the Milky Way first started spinning
Sound was the only thing living
The Universe was singing, signals were pinging
Life began to emerge from one light blinking
The sound stabilized it
The color spectrum was immediately divided by levels of brightness
The speed of the spin began rising
Gravity was created and forever affected by this
And thus, the elements were created in a cradle
Smashing against one another like balls on a pool table
We like to label so we give things names
I shook your hand and told you mine was Germaine
In my dream I was hoisted into a plane with a space-age frame by a giant gantry crane
My code name was SpitBoss, T-minus 2 seconds 'til liftoff
Let me tell you what Canibus saw:
I saw a world in deluge, fighting over fossil fuels and food
Like a bunch of god damn fools",https://genius.com/Canibus-lunar-deluge-lyrics
Cingularity Point,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"This is for the I.M. Culture
A poor pauper's offering for the alter
The 'C' of Tranquility, I'ma show you what I see
The 'C' of Tranquility, I'ma show you what I see

The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? What do you really see?
I see a revolution in the industry
That will ignite the rebirth of MCs lyrically
The 'C' of Tranquility, what will they really be?
What does the future hold? What can you really see?
I see the partition of God's religion
Become united by our bars and our common visions

Been a long time spitting long rhymes, but I never left you
Always came back busting rhymes that were special
Back then, I wanted to impress you by addressing the truth
Nowadays, I'm just confessing in the booth
The Golden Era of Rap will always be apart of me
The future talks to me because the present is ignoring me
My destiny is calling me, the armory of God is guarding me
But all you can see is holographic artistry
Rhyme mechanics, like that of a blind pianist
The keys are metallic, my fingers are magnets
The music is magic, what is this madness?
The stanzas are rites of passage, your left brain habits become your baggage
The masses become savage, roaming the streets with torn fabrics
Creativity is less than average
Every baby is born a bastard, so why did you have it?
This question requires no answer, I understand it

The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? What do you really see?
I see a revolution in the industry
That will ignite the rebirth of MCs lyrically
The 'C' of Tranquility, what will they really be?
What does the future hold? What can you really see?
I see the partition of God's religion
Become united by our bars and our common visions

Through my music, magic and inoculated interaction
Rip the Jacker shows you the future in fragments
Through madness my view is expanded, request passage permission is granted, I'll introduce you to the language of dragons
To help balance near impossible trances in the labyrinth of the enchanted
Where air quality is unbearably rancid
From evil spirits, temperatures frigid
I cross wooden bridges over methane rivers, it sounds crazy, but listen
Concise lyrics strike down from the heavens
A titan like Mike Tyson, Beastmaster with a tiger and pigeon
A four finger ring with a eyeball in it for vision
'Cause I ain't scared of no 9 foot 11 winged lizards
I'm known as the Ripper, my soul was delivered to a wizard
For spiritual slave labor in a prison
My life is my sentence, so I live it
But I studied the physics and understand it, so it's only a visit

The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? What do you really see?
I see a revolution in the industry
That will ignite the rebirth of MCs lyrically
The 'C' of Tranquility, what will they really be?
What does the future hold? What can you really see?
I see the partition of God's religion
Become united by our bars and our common visions

Combinatorics anything of this persuasion is considered ageless
Beyond the matrix
Beyond time displacement of space and spaceships in oasis
Beyond the reach of human contemplation
The music is layered, not computer generated
A human made it to satisfy unusual cravings
The mystic in a room with crystal walls and floors
Looking into a crystal quartz orb, reciting lyrical law
That cause warm feeling sensations
Precipitating from the finger tips to the arms to the lips to the jaws
To a gold tongue that spits to the tone of the drum
With the oxygen that flows down the throat to the lungs
Till every color of my chakra glows brighter than the Sun
You and I become we, we become one
And the clarity of singularity has begun
Between zero point zero and zero point one

The 'C' of Tranquility, what will it really be?
What does the future hold? What do you really see?
I see a revolution in the industry
That will ignite the rebirth of MCs lyrically
The 'C' of Tranquility, what will they really be?
What does the future hold? What can you really see?

Merchant of Metaphors,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"I need a jet stream pattern assessment, go get it
And tell me the direction that the fuel tank is headed
Scram jet packs straps attached to my back
Rocket exhaust melt skin off like wet wax
Call sign Tom Cat, master ace of aerial combat
I double-time out to the tarmac
Fog covers the launch pad, 
order ATC to fall back
But maintain visual contacts
Switch to radar, innovation navigational star map
I won't need to travel beyond that
My jet contrails so long that
It can be seen in time zones eight hours apart by 
NORAD
Bow waves are made when I sweep my arms back
To fast track to the lunar surface's dark patch
The darkest part of the Moon where ISS2 was parked at
Inside onyx black alien artefacts
Well guarded in the event of a chartered attack
The outpost is nothing more than a trap
The Red Planet approach close
, I know perigee and impact
Phobos is controlled by the Dracs
Deimos
 is the most underrated of the pack
It decimates NEA's more than double its mass
A solar max melts polar caps
I notice that think tanks with closed minds miss unknown facts
Satellites track and match the stats, statistics start to stack
I'm a man of science, not Rap
With actionable impulse to act when I can’t relax
I work hard but play harder in fact
My rose garden attracts rats
I sit back and listen to jazz and smoke hash in a mineral bath
I meditate, slightly awake, the moon rays
Interpermeate my physical state, I gaze into space
The light waves race and shift shape, colors escape
I concentrate on eight frequency rates
The body begins to numb as the spirit elevates
But wait, I’m interrupted by a buzzer at my front gate
Closed circuit surveillance showed me a face
How entertaining, special agents came to visit my estate
“Miss Moneypenny, bring me a plate a cup of tea
And my terry-cloth robe, then show them in to me, I’ll wait”
He walked in with a blank face, I calmly remarked, “You’re late”
He responded with a strong handshake
Miss Moneypenny returned with eggs and pancakes
I offered them a seat, standing up, looked so out of place
He kindly obliged but the other two continued to stand
Folded their hands and gave me the nod
The silence was so profound that even soft sound seems loud
With ambient music in the background
I slurped when I sipped my tea, it was hot
I chomped when I chewed my chow, it was not
In slow motion the silence was broken, you could hear a pin drop
He said, “You cannot save Hip Hop”
I said, ""Why not? I sold mixtapes to buy stock
I’ve been researching and developing a spitbox
Rap is deeply rooted in the music generation
I can prove it, but it doesn’t constitute publication""
I swear the Great Bear entered the Dragon’s Lair
I was there in the centre of St. Petersburg Square
Assigned as a silent observer, but I witnessed a murder
Took a picture of the body and a burner
Circa the time, you called me from Burma
In Port Charlotte Florida, say you were in a coastal corridor
And that’s what you call help?
Eight months of Camp Kill Ya’ Self couldn’t rehabilitate what I felt
And now here you are, in my backyard
Accusing me for being an outlaw for my bars?
I ain’t got nothing for ya, I’ll call my controller
You call your employers, they can talk to my lawyers
He got up and turned his back on me and said, “I’ll be back homie”
I said, ""You better bring an army""
He said, “You don’t want war”
I called Moneypenny on the intercom and said, “Baby, show them to the door”

My tongue hydraulics
Strong enough to flip a 64 Impala with 3 adult passengers
And a 400 pound driver
And drown you in less than an ounce of your own saliva
Rubberface rappers get, stretched like elastic
Claymation characters wit verbal vernacular
Slappin' ya, like a white water rafter
Or a Olympic kayaker, paddlin' across the Niagara
My afterburners'll be burnin' you after
Ya' body already been splashed with acid
And you turn to ashes
Assassins camouflaged in the grass blastin'
Leavin' blood all over ya' lady like Jackie Onassis
I'll fly ya' body outta Dallas
Perform plastic surgery while we airborne and switch caskets
Then lie to the masses
I'll tell'em that you got murdered over some East West beef, between rappers
Radio stations'll express they sadness
Play classics back to back and pass out ""Stop The Violence"" pamphlets
Just imagine, every night ya' girls fuckin' ya' best friend
While you in hell throwin' tantrums

Givin' some pretty ass bitch a spankin'

So don't even bother askin' Angela Bassett
You just get ya' ass kicked
Get ya' head chopped off and dropped in a basket
My left arm's taken but my right one's free
That means I could diss another muthafuckin' emcee
Wit rhymes that appear clearer than liquid crystal
My lyrical is more visual than television screen pixels
I fire pistols, hit you wit' miniature missiles
Riddle ya' body wit' holes then watch the blood sprinkle

Know what is, Me and Bis, runnin' through ya courtyard
Creepin' wit a four-five and reachin for ya door knob
Throw a gun under ya chin, see how quick your whore rise
One shot could have a thought slide, right out the North side
Your whole flow is pork rind
Spit your small oinks

Drop on top of the blue line, right beside the red one
Keep the flow fearsome, 'til the day my career done

""Also the, hearing from the defense department that they launched
Some fifty Tomahawk cruise missiles
Not only from ahh US ships but also from British
Submarines in the area""

Draft me! I wanna fight for my country
Jump in a Humvee and murder those monkeys!
Draft me! I'm too dedicated to fail
Justice must prevail (Justice must prevail!)

Yo, I wanna get drafted, I wanna see somebody get they ass kicked
With standard military tactics
Fuck brass knuckles, I'll punch you with brass fists
Totally flowin with my emotions in my moment of madness
I'll wake up the whole barracks, murder you on your mattress
And look at you like, ""What's the matter?""
You better go back to your bed, before I have to act up
You might be the next one to get ripped you jacker!
You better not tell the captain
I might accidentally shoot you with the mack 10 at target practice
Runnin' through the obstacle course, up and across
Over the logs, five more, damn soldier you strong
Come on, I wanna be agile and docile
Break ya legs like popsicle sticks, put you in a hospital
Stand over top of you, put a pillow over your nostrils
And just feel so sorrowful
It doesn't make me feel powerful, it's just a parable
It's just a rhyme really none of this is tangible
So don't ask me about it, I won't get angry at you
And before I get angry, I just won't answer you
You better go get in shape or lift some weights nigga
Cuz next time I see you I'mma be a ape nigga
Lemme find out you still callin out my name
I'll crash into your tour bus with a plane nigga


Fuckin with my freedom, leave a muh'fucker bleedin
Leave 'em in pain like a infant when he teethin
It's huntin season, and ya loved ones grievin
Cuz I never back up (no sir) I never back down
Ask Brown (Ha!) From the bell to the last round
Face down, dick in the dirt, hit 'em where it hurt
Make the enemy my lil' bitch in a skirt
Cuz when it rained it poured, this ain't a game it's war
One goal, one aim son, same as yours
Alotta pain to endure, terrain to explore
And I'mma hold my weapon right cuz I was trained in the Corp
You don't want no trouble, whole city reduced to rubble
And we gon' make it happen, quick, fast, and on the double
Draft me!

So y'all best go get y'all shuffles!
(Draft me) The situation's gettin ugly
So who better but me, and put to sleep the enemy
Draft me, pass me the M-16
Give me a buzz cut, ask me if I give a fuck
I'm comin out blastin, military four-fashion
Twelve close castin, for weapons of mass-distraction
Outlastin all the privates in my company
Fightin for my family, and the cats that grew up with me
My Band of Brothers, rarely just smother the enemy
Razor blades cut ya face and leave a scar so you remember me
Lurkin, to leave y'all with bloody red turbans
Screamin ""Jihad!"" while y'all pray to a false god
We ready for, all out war, it's time to settle the score
Grab a .44 and dump into nigga's door
Draft me, you ain't even gotta ask me, I'm ready
With the Rambo machete, using tactics that's deadly
Draft me, I swear to God, we ready for the Taliban
Drop the bomb, and huddle with some nuclear laws, come on!


Truthfully, I wouldn't wanna go to war if they asked me
I'd rather puff hashish and talk about headies and Lassie
I was just sayin to Canibus last week
I heard a record called Channel 0 that was mad deep
When I'm overseas I can't eat, the food is nasty
Bis has a seafood fancy, I'm allergic to crabby
G'head draft me, you're all in my new family
I'll have a good time wavin gats at them arab sheikhs
If I get hit, one of the team'll carry me
So g'head draft me, g'head draft me

You number 1? Then I'm negative 2
Basically, nigga, that means I'm still better than you
Basic mathematics, the verbal mechanics of rhymin'
Behold, I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond
On the microphone, I'm sicker than those
Who've Acquired-Immune-Deficiency-Syndromes
And every word I utter for hip-hop lovers
Will reflect forever like two mirrors facin' each other
The baddest M-other F-ucker
Let me break the style down so you don't have to wonder
I walk the B-lock with G-lock C-ocked
Tryin' to get the D-R-op on the C-ops
Blow spots, capsize boats, shipwreck yachts
Headshots hit you with 300 nautical knots
You callin' the cops, complainin' about the hip-hop
Gettin' Benjamin's like the L-OX
; 
it don’t stop
Eh-eh-eh-eh, put away your burners, you can't serve us
My whole camp is allergic to bein' murdered
Metaphors is proof I got more than just a couple screws loose
Latinos call me the black Jesús
So for all who believe in telekinesis and Jesus
I'll touch a paraplegic and heal him",https://genius.com/Canibus-freestyle-97-lyrics
The Odds,Full Spectrum Dominance,2018,"The odds are you can't even tell the mixing board is a holy grail
For styles like this only for those who know it well

Another stone for Thanos to unveil requiring control skill
Mix without crashing zig-zag-Allah autopilot passengers
Hypnotized by the magic practice
Pragmatic practicalist poetry in motion by accident
And cry like I never asked for this
The experiment for buzz, that's what Hip Hop was

Good Equals Evil,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"A man pays dues, do this become an angel
Good and evil, a man stays true
There are other ways to win
Good and Evil, it's the same thing

A decade after my debut, the game changed; I got the same views
To me it's just baseball and I'm Babe Ruth
Bambataa from Planet Rock,
 trade op commander Hip Hop
What? We grimlock smash Spitbox
You can never be the best, until you complete the competency test
With Rap pattern parameters I set
Are you deaf? Do you need me to repeat what I said?
I said you'll never be the best unless you pass this test
Okay, fill out registration form 88
Name, social, date of birth, address, city and state
When the form is complete pass it on to Angela Clark
To determine your eligibility and get you insured
Every morning the board panel assembly judges man by his bars
Courage of heart and what he offers the cause
If he's accepted he'll be sworn in tomorrow
If he's rejected he's recycled and retested on stage at the Apollo
I had to and so do you, are you solid or hollow?
Depression is normal, a challenge to climb out of your sorrow
Forget about the world around you, the truth is
They are nothing without you but you will be nothing without the truth

A man stays true, a man pays dues
If a man can do this, the man become an angel
There are other ways to win, a consequence for every sin
But we are blind because Good and Evil is the same thing

Do not be confused by the choice of words used
For every battle we win, there's something we lose
But you still have to choose and choosing not to choose is still a choice
Sometimes silence is a powerful voice
The body is of no use if the mind is enslaved
But theses slaves can not bind your light or your sound waves
However, we must to train to increase our strength
The final test is presented when we least expect
We look forward, we see 180 degrees, what's left?
We eyeball right to left but see nothing, what's next?
180 degrees of regret, what's that?
It's everything we left behind unchecked, it wants revenge
They want revenge against us because we fight for our freedoms
Die for what we believe in and they know we don't need 'em
I know you disagree, you think it's fortune cookie shit
But I guarantee you this, our future was prefixed


I look towards the sky for the answers to why
I analyze the great divide and saw God on both sides
God didn't do this, we did this to each other
So keep his name out your mouth, you fucking cock suckers
How could you own all of it, when we are all apart of this?
The Earth belongs to every living thing that walks upon it
We are all perfect creations, with imperfect justifications
But just the patient fuck the subject of Satan
The Universe is too huge, does Satan live out there too?
Or is he just after me and you?
Believe what you perceive
Look at the Sun, tell what do you see? 360 degrees of light beams
Illuminating Hip Hop, Spitboss'll bag your pops
You ain't ready for the shit that I got
It's called Hip Hop homey, that's the only way that you know me
And knowing people can still be lonely
At the Maharaji spa for the whole week
I just go to sleep because when I wake up I am not an emcee
I get back on the clock when I hear the next beat
I'll write about another century of heat, I'm a beast",https://genius.com/Canibus-good-equals-evil-lyrics
Black Lithium,Full Spectrum Dominance,2018,"As I lay my head down to sleep
In true hip hop my soul will speak

I quit giving a crap about rap way back
But this is poetry - something that they can't take back
Right ascension, nineteen hours and fifteen lyrics
Declination fifty degrees of sixteen spirits
From carbon I came, to carbon I return
It seems like ridicule is all that I've earned
Black lithium clouds
Maritime meridian bound
Rap music look how silly you sound
Insectoids, high pitch voice, fricking cricket noises
It's annoying like poison from Neonicotinoids
Tell me who does the Creator favour?
The one who loves thy neighbour
Or the intolerable self-hating hater?
Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Shmuck!
Which one of you cucks
Clean it up without making a fuss!

Black lithium
You can't take my mind from me

I've released thousands of tracks, received plaques
None of that matters, I wanna believe that
Mic pressure in full power on U.S.S. Nimitz
Elevation is correlated to sea level systems
History is repeated
Patterns of a purge that is critically needed to bring balance to the world
These are not my words, however cruel those words may sound
This is what we are faced with now
They call it choice
I call it an adroit attempt to mind control our soul from a source
A source of power, not ours
We should own our own labour, and we have shown infinite patience
Yet! There is no mention, no concessions
We are stuck, marooned in a place that sucks
Continual with the assumption that everything I'm saying
Can and will be subject to misinterpretation
I don't know what we deserve for still believing these liars for stealin'
Cheatin' and deceivin'
Yes, remain humble
While Fireteam Raven rumbles
In a war wagon that'll pop your bubble

Black lithium
They want our head in the clouds so we don't see how they puttin' it down
Black lithium
You can't take my mind from me

I quit giving a crap about rap way back
But this is poetry - something that they can't take back
Write a message, twenty-three hours and nineteen minutes
Space station, thirty degrees and eighteen inches
Fortune and fame, steep learning curves
The phoenix bird that does not want to re-emerge
You know what they say about every day above ground
You embrace the hate, you can't save love now
Instinctually low impulse control
Often found at some some old heads watering hole
Where you meet your pseudo-maker?
In a volcano crater 
closed chamber
Behold Satan, go and entertain him!
A deal and an oath is struck
Unknown to the deaf, dumb, and blind
You are told to trust
I'll continue with the assumption
That everything I'm saying can and will be subject to misinterpretation
A little bit of history'll tell you the present
I'll be a prophetic, the future might be already written
Unless we become brothers
You will suffer the suffering of the suffered through unjust judgement

Dyson’s Fear of Spheres,Fait Accompli,2014,"Step into the grand SCIF room
Please carefully describe what you see besides a crescent-lit moon
The Frescoes of Pompeii depict modern day
Polyentendres peak like Dante
Speaking of minister Mugabe's calendar in Zimbabwe
The Earth's first ancient underground enclave
Where the priesthood pontiffs burn white smoke to keep conscious
Convene in the square with the black mambas
And the Tibetan mandalas, the plaque of Palanka
Who is your sponsor? Ganja
Mahatma Gandhi in concert before the whole world
Was conquered by the antichrist, I watched it
These problematic mystic nescient narcissistic
Dimwits still obsessed with the way that I spit shit
You sitting on the highway stuck
I get around traffic in a high rail truck with a flywheel clutch
The rap music watch dog, Hip hop robot borg
I got JP Beats on the boards
We Rap music watch dogs, Hip Hop robot borgs
JP headphones got cobalt chords
Special agent Alexander has bad manners
He gerrymanders cancer communities, speaking bad Spanish
And since it's now legal, the task force going wild weasel
They confiscate drugs from the people
Evolved from clips and chrome to bone age cone head clones
With nano ohms operated headphones
Back in the day I used to order chicken parmigiana
At the Mondrian and have a sunset seance
She put a nice négligée on
A soft mink bed spread, we could both lay on and just talk
She flirting, combing through her hair with her own fingers
I wouldn't expect her to know those lyrics
She can't wait to get the album, it downloaded 500 thousand
She says I'm the King of Crap Mountain
For me to sell out, that means somebody gotta buy in
Nobody bit the bait Bis, try again
Confirm life is real, the wound too deep to heal
A man like that does not want to feel
They say I'm too old to rap, six minute mile laps
I'll stop when I'm too old to do that
I work for three shifts of eight then I'm out the gate
I post haste forthwith before I walk away
I been the worlds leading rap manufacturer for quite some while
Don't even trip when they bite my style
I want the whole world to upgrade, humankind struggle to this day
Many survived the double digit age
But the mortality rate everywhere is not the same
Promote life after life like St. Germaine
Rhymes, reasons, signs, times and seasons
The latest in line with unprecedented achievements
We all know what these was, bees where the bees get buzzed
My super bug is immune to the drums
Watch him howl at the Moon, the son of a bitch, half baboon
He got a wrap around serpent tattoo
He sent floods and radiation to poison our blood
He deceived the whole world to destroy our love
He has no color, he doesn't see the other as his brother
Even though he knows we need each other
He's a animal that walks upright with a fucked up love life
He can't even get a hug for the night
If you see me with my teeth fixed, that means I'm rich
If your teeth is fucked up it's cause you sucked my dick
Talk to the Comms chief, he asked, ""What's the status?""
We got to survey the fire lit caverns on Saturn
When we landed in a damaged flight cabin
I got out and saw a hexagonal pattern, walked over and grabbed it
The co-pilot was dead holding a picture of his kids
It would be insensitive to say he wasn't meant to live
I walked forty clicks the from the edge of the A Ring
Crossed over the Encke divison, Molybdenum bridge
The creature I saw, a cross between a pig with the face of a squid
And fine hairs like an Arachnid
It said, ""If you gonna stand there and stare
You might as well walk over here and yank my beard if you ain't scared""
I've seen enough I gotta get back to where to I live
From that place of abundance called the Dyson sphere
I moved to the U.S. when I was two years old
I've paid taxes here so long, this is where I call home
The spectre metrics edit is exceptionally impressive
Syndromic tornado Tourette's but what's that?
Show mercy upon my soul through proper governance and goodwill
I am your obedient servant still
We are consumed by war, slave class martial law
Blood red like the plateau on Mars
I will live, love, learn and try not to burn
For one day soon the golden one shall return
If we discern and work hard to earn, get what we deserve
The golden ones return, it's our turn
Freedom of press means you getting too nosey
Get sentenced to death 'cause those were some senseless steps
Let the rooster take care of his biz, let the hens lay eggs
Let the hard working people make bread
'Cause we don't want much, we just want what we want
You act like we had a choice, like you didn't set us up
If you can't stand the sound of your family's moans
Then you need to get over there and bandage those bones
Squeaky wheels get oiled, silent frogs sit there and boil
All refrigerated items might spoil
Any knowledge is not good knowledge
Unless you gain enough knowledge to emerge from the darkness where it all started
Till the light sparketh, manifest itself and departed
Never to return but yet still a part of it
Do you comprehend that? Say that last part again
""I was busy watching football again""
The power cut off again, on again, off again
It's the end of the world but let's all pretend
It was just an awful dream, can't even express what I mean
'Cause I don't even know what I seen",https://genius.com/Canibus-dysons-fear-of-spheres-lyrics
Behind Enemy Rhymes,Mic Club: The Curriculum,2002,"Behind enemy rhymes, when the curriculum storms
Behind enemy rhymes, when the curriculum storms
It's like this yo, check it out, uh, yo

When the curriculum storms, modern rap history is reborn
On CD code in the form of a poem
Anyone that studies Canibus' past knows he has the answers
To questions you're probably not advanced enough to ask
Super advanced faculty man, chairman of curriculum class
85% never pass, 10% smile and 5% don't even laugh
When the chalks in my hand and I'm drawing up graphs
I present the contingency plan to the top brass
They probably think I'm on speed I'm talking so fast
The body of the rhyme is smooth like body and bath
The summary is more explosive than a meth lab blast
My symmetrical shockwave shatter glasses
My U-235 rhyme hits critical mass
Apocalypse Now, lyrical raps blow everything off the map
From green grass to African Baobabs
Spike with an electro-mag, aircrafts crash
CDC's in the streets passing out gas masks
Gorgeous women thank me for the oxygen tank
Baby, the chevrons on my arm will tell you my rank
Maybe I'll become another casualty in the field
They'll engrave my tombstone with the master steel
The best beats in the world couldn't rival my skill
That's like throwing a cup of water on a million beached whales
Ran eloquence on an unprecedented scale
Close your eyes, feel the rhymes cause I'm better in Braille
The Francis Bacon basics, I should reiterate this
We rise to great heights by winding staircases
The line spiral in a French curve design
When the curriculum storms, Behind enemy rhymes

When the curriculum storms, this is lyrical law
Computer programmed bars come out of digital jaws
This is the toughest course in hip hop so far
Behind enemy rhymes, when the curriculum storms, (x2)

Written addendum, curriculum - attention deficit disorder
Magician flipping them with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
That inhibit them from the seeing the vision when
They spit against Bis and them they must want to get dissed again
I'm sicker than your sixth sense inhale breaths
Through the luffa in my chest bigger than wind tunnel vents
Please believe the ammo is live
My fusillade of rhymes fly through your ride and go stream fuselage
Blistering speed fools eyes with fast rhymes
Setting world records for Nürburgring's fastest lap times
Get chequered flags for 48 tracks of rhymes
A hundred times for vocal signatures too complex to sign
Human by design, a mental monster of the mind
Rhetoric versus reality the reason I rhyme
Eternally inclined to shine
Principles a plenitude, I spit at you, injure you if you step out of line
A transcendental intellectual
A marvel to the medical professionals that claim they have more tests to do
Before they understand what I'm equipped to do
Visual psychoanalytical living proof that I rip you
I rip the roof off like cyclones do
When the curriculum storms I rip a microphone too
A molecular miracle in the physical
My lyrical has always been something different for you to listen to
Difficult but legible, forever memorable
Enough to remain in the membrane of your mental pool
I train your brain muscles and take you to school
Hard rocks become gentle jewels, these are the rules
When you in the Mic Club mood you never get booed
Aptitude and attitude are your battling tools
Stay calm and spit those bars
If you find yourself behind enemy rhymes you got to weather the storm

The Rip Off,C! True Hollywood Stories,2001,"{crowd chanting}
Can-i-bus, Can-i-bus, Can-i-bus
Can-i-bus, Can-i-bus, Can-i-bus 

Can I rip it? (Yes you can!)
Can I rip it? (Yes you can!)
Can I rip it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone (Ohhhhhh!)

Yo, my brain races to create these lyrical mosaics like paintings
To me record store and art galleries are merely the same thing
I feel like I'm Rembrandt and my man Van Gogh is amazin
Canibus is not some average rap patron, have some patience
I went through changes, not being with the majors and all
'Til my man Louie Lombard gave me a call
And talked about some other way to cake off
I thought hmmm.. I could make more, he said ""Sure""
""I could put you in about three thousand stores
And get at least fifty thousand orders""
""Maybe more 'Bus, who knows your fanbase is enormous""
Well of course, look who I've toured with; Wyclef
I didn't sell twenty million cuz it wasn't my time yet
I'm satisfied with the line up I rhyme with
Kool G Rap, Pharoahe Monch, and Rakim
Including future superstars I've worked with thus far
Like Free, from 106 and Park
You need to understand somethin, Bis is raw
Raw to the floor, raw like reservoir dogs
And mechanical mandible jaws, split you in half
Addicted to rippin jackers, but I rip a jackass
Before we battle, there's two questions I have to ask
Are you carrying any firearms, and did you pack your bags?
Cool, cuz I'mma make you feel real bad
And I'mma make you so mad, you'll probably spazz
I can see you tryna get me like they got Biggie
Somewhere in the city, on a pretty day when I dressed in Jiggy
And I got security with me
I'll give you a buck-fifty so quickly
You won't even know that ya nose dripping
So much blood on the floor, you might as well be pretending
To be mudwrestling a dozen bitches PMSing
Sounds kinda tempting, doesn't it?
Dissing me wasn't really worth it, was it?
I'm buggin, I know a lot of y'all loved it
And tried to convince the public to say fuck 'Bus
But just think, I played y'all like a bunch of puppets
You play Russian Roulette with a musket
And got busted in your own nugget
A twenty-one gun salute with no bullets and no trumpets
While the rain pours and the storm thunders
Your rotten carcass smells so pungent, it turns my stomach
Attracts the buzzards, on Fox Eyewitness News coverage
Rip the Jacker's on the loose in London
He slipped through US customs and flew to Dublin
Frontin as a janitor in a school or somethin
Workin for little or nothin, I'm warnin you DON'T TRUST HIM
He's a complete risk to the American public
And don't ever call the law cuz he thinks he's above it
Let's get one thing straight; you can't touch him
Outsmart him, out muscle him, or out hustle him
You can't beat 'em - join 'em, you can't join 'em - fuck 'em
Can-I-Bus, either ya hate him or ya love him


Yeah yeah, I seen you at Ruby Tuesday's
With a toupee, talkin on ya two-way -- you look gay
Nigga I don't give a fuck about the games you play
I gnaw on ya bones 'til my teeth turn blue-gray
Or turn yellow like I ain't brushed in a few days
And the blood starts to taste like red toothpaste
Nigga this ain't communion and that ain't Kool-Aid
Delicacies the FDA won't approve in the states
Like a little witch's brew in your vanilla latte
Or perhaps Filet of Dog in a Malaysian cafe
If I was a cook I would probably take a half day
Clock out and never come back, you keep the back pay
That's some metaphorical shit, all you have A
Is that why all you weirdos all attracted to me?
Look at yourself, why you even listen to me?
Listen to yourself, your constantly dissin me
Well listen to this bitch, get off my D
If you don't think that I'm the illest, that's cool I don't agree
I proved myself, time and time again
Grippin mics like Heinekens, who want me to rhyme again?
You could never expire the fire within
Killin me with a gun is easy, try a pen
For the use it was intended
I don't like to be the one to start the drama nigga
But I know how to end it
Kill yourself I'll take the credit - get it?

Yeah (Jedi Mind)

An isolated regime that works twice the pace of your team
These Jedi Mind Tricks are no dream
Kill-code received, you do not need to know what you need
You will be uplinked to the feed
The entrance to the cave is guarded by a statue of Saint Germain
Holding an oil lamp with a purple flame
Shuffling down the dark corridor, chasing the voice of the orator
The light brightens more and more
Your muscles tight and sore
You fall to waist height then crawl as you are forced to recite bars
From Ars Notoria, what is the origin?
Metaphoric euphoria, lobotomize the audience
Rap music recruited, those who refuse it
Will be uprooted, then electrocuted, then executed
Flesh is fluid, physically it's a stretch to do it
You wake up cold, wet and wounded playing my music
The strong believe in me, the weak try to weaken me
But they are not allowed to speak to me that easily
The fans get neglected, can't get their favorite record
They only get to hear what's selected, not requested
They are wasting your time, just think about that
The reason you won't think is the reason I won't rap
Wisely worded speech, framing technique and thermal heat
Bridges the verbal to the beat, providing earth for your feet
I rip granite, the Universe shaped like this planet
Nobody understand it when my spit is mismanaged
Virtuoso Vivaldi, Aleister Crowley
With a baldy flow flawlessly, cathedral halls applaud me
Red-Three-Delta they call me, in the Red Army Armory
Talking softly, walking calmly, the officers saw me
Cursing at the bastard commie, pass the salami
Rhyming offbeat, they poured me caffeine, not coffee

You'll never hear nothing as evil as this
As this I carry desert eagles into the cathedral and lick
My people are sick your people unbelievably bitch
In Mogadishu counting money inconceivably rich
A feverish pitch, I'll hit you so you bleed where you piss
I feel sorry for any rapper think he equal to Bis
I see through the mist, I see you faggots weak in the wrist
I ain't rapping no more, Pazienza speak with the fists
I see the abyss but I ain't going there no more
I'm too old so I ain't licking in the air no more
Aiyo Bis who these motherfuckers that's thinking it's war
In '88 the only white boy spitting it raw
I kicked in the door, I spoke on metaphysics in awe
But they was too stupid to understand the vision involved
I wish that we all had platinum that could christen the wall

It's like stomping on a whole crate of porcelain plates
Run over your skull with a tank, rip out your guts with a shank
Then bite you with poisonous fangs for trying to fuck with the champ
Nigga you can't, and you shouldn't even try to
Half the square-root of my I.Q. is beyond you
So when you see me on the street, you better not say a mother fucking thing to me
‘Cause nigga, you pink pussy
I got some live niggas with me, with trigger happy fingers of fury
Put one in your skully, and five in your belly
‘Cause whenever rhymes fly, like bullets in drive bys
I catch them and throw them back, like Miami Jai Alai
I cop mine, spin counter-clockwise and shoot five
Three miss you, two hit you; one in the leg, one in the thigh

Before engineers was using pro tools

I'm probably what you would call a
Record industry population enforcer
I slaughter like, a hundred rappers each quarter
In order to keep this shit in order
I track wack niggas down, from border to border
Just like the stories of the hare, and the tortoise
The rabbit was faster, but fell asleep in the forest
But lost, ‘cause the tortoise had endurance
I always stay focused the longest
I promise I can battle any artist 'till they just get exhausted and forfeit
With actual, super-natural forces, I'm a horseman from Hell
Immune to the garlic water, and the crosses
After the last album, I went through a metamorphosis
And probably fired more of my niggas than Doug Morris did
I kicked the dead beats out, turned around and switched my whole team out
Now I got some banging ass beats now
It paid off, ‘cause I came off, like Adolf
And I can murder any God Damn camp I concentrate on
With the first strike, I'm so nice
I can exterminate more niggas than the Third Reich

"Lyrical Law vs. Royce Da 5'9""",Lyrical Law,2011,"Yo, I don't need no 2Pac budget to get 2Pac rugged. I get at you with nothing, fuck it. See the difference between me and you is I know what I'm up against and Im'ma still go in. I know y'all got money. I know y'all got sugar daddies in high places
Tell me something nigga. Do you know who McGregor Mathers is? You don't know McGregor Mathers is Elvis' grandfather? I only met Proof one time in 2000 on Elvis' tour bus in Syracuse, New York. The nigga stepped to his business with me in defense of Elvis cause he loved Elvis. We almost came to blows on that bus over how much this nigga loved Elvis. And all I did was tell Elvis the truth about how I wasn't comfortable with what he said with that ""cancerous coulda respond back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus"" shit. I done said it a million times that I felt it was an ambiguous line to say about somebody you claim you idolized, especially with all that shit I was dealing with. That's why when Clef told me Elvis was ghostwriting for L, I didn't even understand why the fuck Elvis came to my video set for ""I Honor U"", talking 'bout ""I just want to do something with you, dog."" Everybody and their momma in this music industry turned their back on me, A&R's, DJ's, artists, fans, everybody. Twelve albums later, niggas want to act like they don't know how much I love hip-hop, and what I stand for in hip-hop, and how I don't lay down for knowing justice is against the culture. The way I feel about this shit, it goes all the way back to betrayal because at the end of the day, niggas like you only give a fuck about yourself, and devil rewards you for selling out your own niggas, real talk
Let me ask you something, Royce. Why did the nigga that used to run with Proof real tough get on the phone and tell me ""thank you"" for holding them down cause DeShaun's family was starving? This was before I wrote my fucking verse for ""Air Strike."" He told me to throw Rosenberg under the bus. He told me wasn't nobody over there eating, none of the Holtons or D12, none of them. I couldn't even believe it. I didn't even write my verse for Air Strike and this nigga's telling me ""thank you."" 'Til this day, the only way I can rationalize it is to think with my heart and know that Proof was talking to me through this nigga, telling me ""thank you"", cause after ""Air Strike"" came out, Elvis and Rosenberg doubled back to feed Holton's family. Listen, I respect D12, but how can I tell them that? Why would they listen to me? They're not gon' bite the hand that feed them, so I made it easy for niggas. I lit the wick and they cut the fuse. I gave them the chance to tell the whole world the same shit Proof told me through his man. I gave them the chance to tell the world about how they really feel about Elvis pushing them to the side to sign Voltron 5. You will have to be blind, deaf, and numb not to see how them niggas must feel right now. I guarantee you after I said that line, y'all niggas came together like a team cause y'all had a common enemy, me. Recognize what's real, nigga. Stop talking about you don't want nobody dividing you when you ain't doing nothing for niggas any goddamn way. It's fucked up cause Crook is a real nigga, and Ortiz is cool too, but you're the one that's trying to divide niggas. How you're gon' do a HRSMN record without me on it, motherfucker?
You so gangster? The fuck you're doing on Twitter talking to some fake ass account anyway? You don't think I know what's going on? You think I don't know what the fuck is going on? You think I don't know Elvis got the whole hip-hop industry on payroll, including you? How easy is it to read between those lines? I ain't seen near one site confirm what the real Canibus Twitter is. They just keep repeating the fake Twitter account to fuck me around instead of trying to rectify the problem, so when you do the HRSMN record without me on the shit, everybody gon' think I did it to myself. Wow, genius, huh? Act like you know, nigga. Canibus don't need no Twitter to tell you what the fuck he feeling, nigga. I mastered my pen and I mastered these rhymes. Go make some fucking music and stop typing into a freaking machine
I won the whole hip hop franchise in '98 when I started my album up with a dial-up modem. I was the first MC with a website. All of a sudden, nobody in the first-world country could function without technology, but instead of niggas using this shit to be more real, they used the smoke and mirrors to make us antagonize each other with the exponential ability to brainwash the entire hip-hop generation to turn their backs on the champions of the culture, to isolate and alienate the artists who the media has purposefully blackballed, like yours truly
You know what, I'm done, man. Fuck you, Royce. You don't give a fuck about hip-hop, man. How you gon' call yourself a lyricist and disrespect me? Keep doing what your master tell you to do, 'cause there's always a company that's gon' buy you that number one spot for selling that watered-down bullshit until they switch you out. And check this out, all that weapon talk, yada yada, tell them super security niggas to teach you how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble your shit if you're trying to get funky like that, nigga",https://genius.com/Canibus-lyrical-law-vs-royce-da-59-lyrics
One Ought Not to Think,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"This one is relatively short; I won't say much about it

History is a weapon being used against us
Humanity has been abused before but few remember
Human hybrid, Hubble iris, double-sighted, untouchable when it comes to rhyming, but I struggle in private
One ought not to think, in other words stop thinking
Humankind is now on the brink of extinction
The Eagle has landed, Wernher von Braun
Handpicked the evil bastard called Magnum Innominandum
These ice-age quotes opposed Helios
Confusing the most yet I find it remedial
Turn the radio and TV off, think for a second
Technology is a blessing but it's also a weapon
A weapon of mass destruction givin' global instructions
Teaching us how to hate but does it in a way that we love it
Take my beloved rap music, erase the beat
Consumers act like they're afraid of intelligent speech
The rhymes are imagined in theory
Then itemized into a query
It takes more than your ears to hear me
Meditate; you will see it clearly
Elevate to a level where your judgment isn't impaired daily
Before the New World Order right around the corner
One day soon they gon lock down the borders
I ain't a activist, I can't do shit
I'd rather be a pacifist with a full clip
Keep sayin' your prayers, they won't care

The Treaty of 1213 means I work for the Queen
I work to recover my title deeds

I want Freedom, I already know I'm a dead man speaking

Multi-digit palindrome prime lexicon online
Linear lines up right on time
No more lies, crypto contrived quantum worlds collide
The moment the groom returns for his bride
I accept the slander and praise
Cause one of these days, it's gonna happen one of two ways
You wake, none of it's real, you laugh
All of the inertial mass of inert gas splits the world in half
All that is, is reincarnated to live
We only think we're alive but we're really dead
The yellow dragon
 from Hell
Hatched out of a black eggshell with a red tail and deep blue nails
The predator pulls energy from a pool of point 2 mega joules
At zero zero point residue
Ingest the yes pill, this is my last testament of will
Protected by a polar satellite shield, for real
I travel in the flesh but the goal is to travel without
The house of the Lord as a travelling house
In a G2 cloud with helium 3 hues unshrouded
Among spirits that the pyramid houses
Superwaves shear off the sides of every mountain
Spacecrafts land, a God steps down out of it
A little G God, no doubt about it, people crowd around him
Knowledge, looking gallant and valiant
Wisdom, knowledge is nothing without it
Understanding, every attribute itemized and counted
The wind blows up from the ground
The ground makes earthquake sounds, miles of city blocks shook down
The blood thirsty dracs shout, ""Launch the attack!""
They say ""stand like a man or crawl on your back""
Go ahead take a stand, I know you don't understand
See we always have a choice but we never had a chance
The murder weapon was thrown in the pacific in the high seas
That means it will never be retrieved
When individuals decide to climb into a hive mind
They shouldn't be surprised what they find
Your mind is no longer your own
A one billion man army of clones that follow orders like drones
Hopeless silence whispering quotes of violence
The sky is black, the smoke is violet
There is evil at the doorstep of every man
Declaring you have a choice, but you don't have a chance
The savage salivates at the scent of a man
And says you always had a choice but you never had a chance

33 3's,Mind Control,2005,"Intro, 
One ... two ... three...
(Chomping sound) ... three!!

Yo, in linear terms, my 33 degree and a 3rd
Words will give you 30 3rd degree burns
First I write 33 lines to a verse
About how I created the Earth out of 33 quirks
33 of my peers never thought it would work
For 33 days, I started my relentless research
And I figured, if Jigga could do, 22 2's
As an MC, then I could do 33 3's
Suddenly it occurred at 3:30 on March 3rd
It came to me like God's word
I started to load my .33 Caliber Mossberg
Went to the top of the Empire State on 33rd
33 gunshots was heard
33 pedestrians lay wounded or dead on the curb
33 squad cars rushed to the scene
As soon as they heard some madman had gone berserk
I demanded 33 million
Or I was going to kill 33 of the women and children in the building
I gave them 33 minutes to respond
Then I proceeded to arm a backpack nuclear bomb
I set the timer for 3 hours and 3 minutes long
Told them not to try nothing funny or I'd kill them all
They still never responded
Until I saw 33 of the S.W.A.T. team jump out of 3 helicopters
I told them for the 3rd and final time
If they crossed the line again, I'd take 33 lives
3 of the hostages started crying, 3 of them started wilding
And convinced 3 more to start an uprising
3 of them stood to their feet and started freestyling
I didn't know what to do, so I started rhyming
I tried to kick 300 bars
But I got picked off by a sniper from 33 yards
The bullet hit me but it got lodged and ricocheted off
3 organs 3 inches away from my heart
My name went down in history as the illest MC
Rewind it and count it, 33 3's",https://genius.com/Canibus-33-3s-lyrics
Hip-Hop Black Ops,Melatonin Magik,2010,"The Nephilium Pharaoh, the 3,000 year old scarecrow
Hang you from your nose on a square pole
The squid faced rock beast with swamp croc teeth
And a two headed parrot with a desert fatigue beak
Step out the depths of Hell, exhale septic smells
Decorate my bitch breasts with bells
The arthropod tentacles controlled by mental vegetables
Calculated correctitude down to the decimal
Spectacles of doom and gloom and sonic booms
Republicans ride brooms around nuclear mushrooms
You are safe from the nuclear fallout
Now you will crawl out into the hands of a monster now
The best MC turned his launch codes over to me
On my command you will turn the key and we'll see
You know nothing of discipline, you can never go where the Ripper's been
The maze in those caves are infinite

Can't stop, won't stop, Hip Hop Black Ops
The aftermath aftershock is a disaster in a box
With a blue and red ribbon, your writtens were uploaded to the system
The satellite showed me your position

The text is a sick rep for Rippers
The leaders have discovered we the sickest and they wanna sit with us
Through the computer viewer cube like peritubular
Project: Blueberry Fuscia, one of the two possible futures
Revolution Ripper movement you can't stop it
You can't change the outcome, stop resisting stupid
I write what some would call marathon songs
The music industry tried to banish long bars
Your story is weak, your inventory's shorter than your feet
Every week I slaughter seven beats
I'm the 'Beast from the East'
My title can't be touched nowhere on the street
I hear a lot of emcees speak
They fail to recognise that it ain't about beef
I took it to the streets, I took it to the stage
If I believe I am not the illest I'm insane


The vocal spitter serial killer, heads up display with a ticker
And a pitcher and picture of the Ripper
Neurotransmitters hooked up to his central nervous system
It feeds him the purpose and the vision
Jailbreak but not out of prison
Internal hard drive spinning eighty-eight lyrics per minute
For global transmission, the funky technician on a mission
Strapped to a suicide written
Inside my own mind scripting altruistic composition
Musician, wisdom is God-given
Anoint him with oil, anoint him with wine
Anoint them both with Tesla coils if they coin my rhymes
I make things real, I make things that ain't, sound ill
A very good screen writing skill
My higher self is outside the realm where time is felt
Inside Orion's Belt, get them",https://genius.com/Canibus-hip-hop-black-ops-lyrics
Harbinger of Light,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"Yeah, the light of the world
Let me share somethin' witchu
What does not die that eternally thrives, the free mind
That's how you know you're alive

I was spiritual first, she cut my umbilical at the physical birth
And welcomed me to miserable Earth
Why does it hurt? She laid me on my back in the dirt
Covered my girth with a dirty shirt, what could be worse?
She said: ""God bless the dead but they got it easy""
The living get left behind but still can't live their life completely
Tough luck, right before I was about to give up
I passed out emotionally bankrupt
In the dead vegetation it was dark brown red like menstruation
I couldn't eat it despite the temptation
I was hungry and impatient, my hands were shakin'
I stopped payment, they botched my facelift operation
Nip and tuck, livin' it up
DAMN! ""Why you still spittin' 'Bus?""
""Cause you don't listen to my lyrics enough""
At night from a satellite's view the city's the heart
The red and white blood cells are the lights on cars
From that distance, look down and observe my lyrics
The atmosphere's an organism we apparently live in
Since the beginning, the Law of Three, the Law of Seven
I don't question the principle of scale or Heaven
Law 1 through 48
Law 49 is the loophole that I use to escape
Buy the album; get a $50 dollar rebate, before it's too late
2012 is the bill due date
Before that, it's 2008, I know you can't relate
Just by the confuse look on your face
You can't wait, it won't be much longer now
Solar activity is gettin' stronger now
Al Gore was the Person of the Year, maybe more
Maybe I should be for my 400 bar song
Now I'm against the wall drinkin' alcohol at Taj Mahal
Without balance I am bound to fall
The chemicals are color coded, I highly encourage you not to smoke it
It makes you more curious, don't it?
Mass the throttle; crash it into your arch-rival
Tryin' to out drive you, every millisecond is vital
Repsol motorcycles, psycho, breathe nitro
Brain cells glow with a light dose, so!
I could Tokyo Drift with no Coke to sniff
I shift from 6th to 5th, I broke the shit
The gearbox slipped, red Marlboro's for hot lips
Order drinks, fire water type toxic shit
Now I got you in the kill box, bitch!
On 6, 5, 4, 3, I got this, 2, 1, 0, the shot hit
The unsung hero on some Hip Hop shit
And I dare you to tell me not to spit
I evolved from clay and statue, from statue to flesh
From flesh to dirt, from dirt to death
Beyond that whatever life is left we gotta live it 'til the end

One of which went on to be a successful actor
Here's the re-enactment: He called me at my man's crib
The phone probably rang two times, then I answered
He sounded really amped up, he tried to scare me
He told me that Def Jam wanted to ban me
And told me Tracey Waples wanted to bang me
Damn I wanted to get in her panties, she was scared of me
Canibus hates the media and the magazines
They add so much credibility to elaborate schemes
Internet chatrooms with live feeds
Of a rapper bein eatin alive by live bees
Sound barriers like the Lockheed, even with knock-knees
I run across rough terrain at mach speed
That's a rhyme from like 9-3
As vivid in the mind, as pictures with 600 DPI's to a sheet
If I'm high when I speak, the knowledge is deep
Solid as concrete, this is real hip-hop for the streets
I never leave any witnesses, it's ridiculous
They served me court papers in the studio I did this in
Missin from society, because they lied to me
They didn't want to accept my doctrine of society
I studied with hundreds of scientists and science teams
At various Ivy Leagues, they respect my esteem
What do you want me to rap about? Go ahead try a theme
Gimme a person, place, or thing - I'll create the time and scene
Somewhere in Afghanistan, U.S.A survival teams
Keep a eye on their surroundings in the Jihad Regime
A total riot scene, back and forth they encrypt fiber optic beams
On my album out next spring
You motherfuckin right nigga I'm about that cream
I promised my self I wouldn't shoot it without that scene
It doesn't look right like Cash Money without that bling

It so happens I'm looking for a copy I could buy
Canibus is comin for y'all round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
A lotta y'all shine, but y'all can't rhyme
And it's about time that I put y'all in line
Twist your mind with twisted rhymes
As weird as Michael Jackson's nose from the side
Flows that'll buy the quite bow for the times
No need to hide your friends are all associates of mine
Dont be a stranger come over some time
I got coke if you do lines, you get a Rover to drive
If you hear the engine knockin, just pull over to the side
I guess it hasn't been serviced in all this time

I spit it exquisite and rip it minute by minute
I'm in it to win it, you fucking rhyme with Bis you finished
Lyrical menace scrape enamel off your teeth like a dentist
With a sedative administered from the executive senate
Poor progression followed by metaphorical methods
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing, testing
Supreme supremacist nemesis to competitors
Predators eat intestines of anything they interested in
Slice you like lettuce and celery start seven
Then make an MC salad out of suckers and sell it
For an expensive percentage with nine tenths of the credit
Drink Red Bull beverage to increase lyrical leverage
I only give respect to Mic Club members and my own mentors
In the center of my circle where I dare you to enter
This is art imitating life imitating art
Imitating the brain simulating thoughts when I talk
Idealistically I spit for free
The stenography of the rhyme is what balances me, challenges me
EA-6B Prowlerss, superior air power
Will fly around us with propulsion that's soundless
Spitting rhymes out by the thousands
Nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue calm me down a bit
Attitude - cynicism and lassitude
Battle you? Come on dude, I should slap you fool
Spit what, I'll leave your lips numb the friction is so sick son
Your chin'll disappear from attrition
Rhythmic high intensity conflict is a given it
Especially if Canibus is doin the rippin
You snipping to clipping in the C-section incisions
With scissors with rubber ergonomic grip for the fingers
Liars for hire with a defense like Geoffrey Fieger
And rock it like thugs who work for Mic Club
Hyped up, tear the mic up my man
And move forward as expeditiously as I can
Ain't nobody in the world like Bis
The nitrous with radio telescopic devices, same type shit
Facially hairless, a gregarious Jamaican-American
Lyricist turned microphone terrorist
Airlift me off the front line to my therapist
So I can sit in his chair and tell him how much I care for this
This is what they want, this is what they love
To engage in the exchange of ideas and drugs
While I'm in the cut satellite tracking you rappers
With months of food rations beneath the 
Catacombs of Paris
Theories of super-lattice and super-savage
Atomic attack tachometers flash when I punch the gas bitch
The farther I climb the harder I rhyme
You gotta face death and survive to feel more alive
The quality of life is an illusion of the mind
Super-imposed lines look two-dimensional from the side
According to the science of the C-section applied
If they say I'm the best after I die - don't be surprised
I C-section the sky let my energy rise
At the moment of truth I know it's definitely my time
As my soul is eased through the sieve I'll be grateful because I lived
The only drawback is that I didn't have kids
To C-section my beautiful wiz
And see the resemblance of my face in hers or his
Who knows what the future will bring, it stresses me to think
This mic meant everything now it doesn't seem important
Now I gotta follow orders, defend borders
From Maine to California, Seattle to Florida
If I could talk to the Oracle I know what I'd ask her
I'd speak to her about my passions
As the hourglasses turn and my life passes
I'll just wait 'til I see the Master and I'll just ask him
Forget it, that's the future, this is the present

You wanna talk to the kid? Enter this ten digit grid
I'll explain to you what I did
Seven oh two, three eight six, five three nine seven, call, leave a message
Y'all niggas can't rap, so why you wanna go and do that?
You move the crowd, I move the map
The defiant mad lion triumph over the rulers of Zion
Fuck your Blood Diamonds, I'd rather laugh dyin'
Miners in the mineshaft cryin'
Apocalypto from GITMO, I clash with the last Mayans
The Sunstone science
The black, red, and blue alliance
Jump through the fire, you'd be a fool to try it
The fire suit don't fit, NO SHIT!
My Saratoga suit got a customized grip
With a batwing released from both wrist and both feet
Blazin' hot, but I don't feel no heat
Hip-Hop's master chief, ""Here, have a seat""
In the mic booth where I hang slabs of meat
Before, during, and after the debrief I'll crack your teeth
Don't talk unless you asked to speak
The Rift Valley fever symptoms could last for weeks
We call a hell in a cell, watch the bastard tweak
Reach 80° degrees North, 14° degrees East
Beneath the ice sheet lies the Spitsberg Beast
Transmission distorted, injuries reported, mission aborted
Follow your orders, move forward
BRAVO!
I fell in love with Suzanne Malveaux
On the down-low, now you know
She talked to the Canibus man
Code name: Javelin Fangz
With 'Nothing to Prove' to the rap fans
Could elaborate further, but suffice to say
""Goddamn that emcee made my day""
He's a butcher, a baker, a vapor box maker from Jamaica
Still talkin' trash to the haters
I clash with the greatest
This is major manual labor, beta test the data with blue lasers
Canibus wave analysis, 'Nothing to Lose' in Los Angeles
Suing Hip-Hop for the damages
G-force: 10.4

Missile lock-on, stop the song",https://genius.com/Canibus-702-386-5397-lyrics
Wake up show freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, me and Jurassic 5 in a chromed out Navigator
Counting paper, who wanna taste the new flavor?
We go hard like terrorists smuggling bombs
Blow up a plane fuselage with the president on board
Starting problems, bringing drama regardless
We get our points across like a trapeze artist without falling
Twin turbine rhymes with 4 thousand pounds of thrust
Can-I-Bus, Can-I-Bus
If you one of them niggas that only trust what you can touch
When you see me give me a pound and shut the fuck up
No diggity, I smack rappers silly for drilling me
Lyrically
The hardcore metaphor war trilogy
With the verbal chemistry punks can't understand
How Canibus kills a man with less than 10 lyrical milligrams
Of the illest jam you ever seen or heard
Special operatives rocking this to get the proper burn, what!

Canibus is above the law I make cops shit in their draws
They won't even dispatch the call if my name is involved while you pray to Allah
Reading your Qur'an and your teaching of Muhammad
I'm in my crib studying thuganomics
Punks wanna murder me
That's why my Burgundy Suburban be
Full of Secret Service security
Transporting me back and forth from the Affirmative Action University and aircrafts to take off and land vertically
The fact that I ain't treated like a king is absurd to me
From the streets of Dirty Jersey to Germany niggas heard of me
Verbally murdering you thoroughly without effort
I get drug tested before I can rhyme on the record
Remarkable specimen
With an audible weapon
Processing lyrics in less than one hundreth of a second
Beef, bring it
Bullets in barrel, spin it

After nonsense I got the reinforcements to crush any enemies offense
With a hundred thousand horsemen
The hardest muthawat, on the market right here
I complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra terrestrial biological entities waiting for the energy battling for world supremacy
Who wanna get touched?
The Can-I-Bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushing MCs, jumping out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves
Integrating you whack MC's like like MIB's with dark glasses
Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed by flashing
Bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras so when you revived you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps SABS on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic and take advantage of opportunities to do damage
I'll pierce you'r heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster than the speed of light, is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark that'll rip you apart
My state of the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies with the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity
With is actually what happens to any wack MC for battling me

I'm a nuclear warhead
Right now you're provoking my detonation
Never test me without proper authorization
My lack of patience will cause me to get mad
And explode right in front of your face like an air bag
Your rhyme is fake
Your brain is child's play to manipulate
I create lyrics too  intricate to imitate moving at a velocity
That'll break you'r stop watch if you're clocking me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji but iller than what you've seen in the cinema
A five foot eight nigga with more horse power than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin pentium tips
That's double the clock speed of a 586
And nothing about  my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavors beyond what you'r tongue is capable of tasting
You'll be surprised you won't believe you'r own eyes
It's like explaining color to man that's born blind on of a kind
I got divine chromosomes in me
My sperm will scramble the eggs of a woman's ovaries
Cause I'm as original as it gets
And I can't respect
Niggas that copy  like double decks
I get vexed
When crab punks bite my style cause I'm selling a thousand records per day per square mile
Breaking the law of physics with metaphors and lyrics speaking to dead poets by conjuring up their spirits
From Shakespeare to  Edgar Allan
Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around with the talent
Much less understand it
I make tight rope walkers at the circus loose they balance when I kick the planet!",https://genius.com/Canibus-wake-up-show-freestyle-lyrics
Lyrical Law vs. Joey Cupcakes,Lyrical Law,2011,"First things first man, you fucking with the worst
You better bring a ice pack when I see you in person
And I'ma bring a Arsenol, ask Joe who the fuck he talking to
He the softest nigga in the group
Blood thicker than water, wash it off after the Slaughter
Green Hornets, black microphone marauders on set
Break necks without breaking a sweat
People wanna see mic wreck, you wanna tweet texts
I am Hip-Hop Ron Artest, the bars I said
Off with they head, everybody I gon' dead
Who they got, Kid Vicious? You wanna piece of me?
One day we gonna see who's the better emcee
What a tangled web you weave
I'm the only MC the whole world'll ever need
Agreed, you drunk or high? Doesn't make a difference when you die
Couldn't tell you what wasn't on his mind
Saying you the best and not proving it, proves less
Disrespectful piece of shit, I'm coming for you next
Malcolm XOX showing contempt instead of showing respect
That proves his stress, jabs don't connect
Leave his face like Jonah Hex, ice pack cold and pressed
Internet snitching like a little bitch
Joey Low Life, living off rice and goat tripe
He boasts on the mic, then he posts on the site
Then exposed his whole life for the dope, for a price
Don't rep the culture right, sold his soul for the hype
Got known overnight for niggas fucking his wife
Got bust in the eyesight and still wouldn't fight
Bare hands to the gun, to the knife, you a gutless type
I'ma show you what your guts look like
You're a disgrace to Jersey, you suck on the mic
You and 5'9"" is like two moist butt wipes
Walking around all uptight, buzzing in the club all night
Two drunken mics hollering, ""Thug Life""
You 'bout as bright as a broken floodlight
Can-I-Bus you in the head with a bottle of Bud Light
One love, one life, one shot, one kill gunfight
Joey Cupcakes Budden got a bear cub bite

""I thought Canibus killed him, but for some reason...""
""What fuckin' reason?""
""Relax, you got your muscles tight. Relax, alright.""

Canibus writes a rhyme then Canibus spits, Like
Ha ha ha ha ha
I eat eat eat rhymes, Niggas don't be understanding that shit
Why you think I went and put a fucking mic on my arm
Cause it belongs to me and I belong next to Ghengis Khan
In a coffin carbon-dryed with my body in bronze
Like Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars
Ha ha ha ha ha
I'm great but I'm not the greatest
Ha ha ha ha ha
I believe I'm God but I'm not atheist

I'm crazy but I'm not the craziest

You can agree with uh-huh or disagree with uh-uh
Whatever, niggas can't front

If they respond too late to the 911 call
They find you on the floor with a razor blade in your palm
Deep cuts an inch wide and 5 inches long
Paramedics feel for a pulse to see if you gone
You was pronounced D.O.A. before you got to E.R
The doctor swore that suicide was the probably cause
Probably because, you weak insecure motherfuckers
Feel lost when you hear me roar

Rip the Jacker

Its legibly unimaginable, mathematically incalculable
Inextricably infallible
Let's not forget utterly impossible or
Morally insurmountable to assume that I could lose if I battled you
My Scholastic Aptitude is 1602
100 bars was just a glimpse of the truth
Physical proof that I'm the best at this
I've constructed sentences
That'll stand longer than Stonehenge's megaliths
My 1st and 2nd albums consist of more then a million terabits
More than any of you rappers ever spit
Vote for me as President, in about a day or so
I be up in the White House getting fellatio
By an administrative assistant with deep throat
Butt naked on the floor knee deep in some coke
Or on a speaker phone freestyling with some of my folks
Humping a ho tampering with the Republican vote
I'm like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, fighting swordsman
Dodging arrows from the arches cause I'm a Horseman
Flying circles around you like flying saucers
Flying circles around the royal air force's flying fortress
Maximize my wins, minimize my losses
'Til I'm exhausted then lounge like the lyricists on Rawkus
I'm unsigned right now, it's like I'm an orphan
Looking for a home taking all calls and offers
Notify the Prince and the Duke of Earl
I'm probably the illest English speaking MC in the world
Ghetto fabulous, verbally hazardous
Ask any Baptist, Roman Catholic or satanic activist
Even them trippy hippies on college campuses know about Canibus
I've got rhymes like beads on an abacus
My styles totally out the bracket
Scientist in thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it
My talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz
By any rapper on this planet's grid
Show me where he is, I sign the ordinance
To bomb his coordinates with Agent Orange and torture him
Burn the skin off of him, throw a towel on him and stomp on him
Rip the towel off then pour salt on him
Continue my verbal assault on him til its 12 in the morning
And turn into the werewolf monster on him
Rip his heart out, eat it while its still pumping
The blood still running, it tastes like boiled dumplings
Starving artist, I turned down scholarships to Oxford College
Cause I heard they didn't serve porridge
Smarter than any man in Scotland Yard is
Used to work for MI-6 but quit cause I couldn't take orders
I was the original James Bond before Sean Conn', Roger Moore
Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan
The most awesome walking, talking, breathing
English speaking MC in the European region
Rip you to pieces like Communism leaflets
Beef with 'Bis is like playing chess without the pieces
Modern Christians without Jesus, Rastas without reefer
Jamaicans in Princeton without visas
Radios without speakers, Mother Nature without the four seasons
Without a jacket outside when its freezing
I'mma tell you straight up, no lie

You Can’t Fuck With the Canibus Man,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, yo, let me explain something so that you understand
You will never be iller than the Canibus man
You could be male, female, black, white
Fuck the details, I rip a nigga with a rhyme till he screams help
Any nigga I told to kneel knelt
You haven't the slighest idea what a real MC is about
You need to be yourself, you can't sound like nobody else
And you can't do all of the beats yourself
You can't do it without the street's help
Niggas on the block that blast the boom box till the speakers melt
That's how I was brought up, big fat elephant balls what
I'm a knucklehead with big walnuts, small frame extra large guts
I'll do anything to a nigga if he pushes me hard enough
I use to rhyme like all day
I mean little nigga spittin till my jaws felt sore with pain
I use to train with myself in the mirror
Like ""Mirror mirror on the wall, tell me who's iller""
How you like that? I use to say it just like that
Maybe I should copyright that, I'll be right back
(Pause)
Sorry to leave you hangin
I write things down quick cuz I ain't takin no chances
Thats the difference between you and me
You a wanna-be, and I'm an MC
I'm just in the booth right now
I'm just kickin it with you right now
I'm tellin you the truth right now
You can't fuck with the Canibus man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man
Chorus: Pacman
You can't fuck with the Canibus man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man (2x)

Now in this rap field, I got a lot of confirmed kills
I put niggas through drills to prove if they got true skills
You coulda sold millions, 
but if you ain't got 100 bars shut the fuck up
At least don't talk to me, cuz I ain't hearin you
If you that ill, give me a hundred bars, I'm darin you
I definitely ain't scared of you
I go to war cuz I'm prepared to lose
Just as long as I get to damage you
Take the mic from you, then put a knife in you
That's what I like to do, make you lose a pint or two
If you a lion I'm a tiger too
I could be as nice as you, but if you a snake I'm a viper too
Look you in the eyes and lie to you
Thinkin about all the possible ways to kill you while I smile at you
You like to get fly nigga I'm a pilot too
Don't even try to get deep cuz I'm a diver too
Don't try to fit in my shoes cuz you can't
Nobody can fuck with the Canibus man, understand?
Chorus (2x)

Yo, yo, yo, my mouth is mechanically mechanized
My verbal weapon fires a whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round
Can-I-Bus will buss ya, apply enough pressure to crush ya, I pulverize mother fuckers
Leave MC's laid out like hurricane debris, 15 Megatons of TNT
The overseas block busta, bustin up blocks like the 
Tiguska meteorite to hit Russia
Comin from the underground I discovered
A ground underneath the ground before underground bunkers
Dedicated spelunkers, deeper than the labryinth
Conductin' excavations of the matrix
Living in uninhabitable places
Craters of a desert-like oasis with the cydonian faces
As barren as Las Vegas
As barren as the wombs of women who use artificial insemination
As barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin
As barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation
A five-star chef makin mouth-watering creations with blood stains on my apron
Put the heads of wack MC's in my oven and bake them
Dip garlic breadsticks in their eye sockets and taste them
It's not really that odd, when you consider part of the ancient culture loves to eat dogs
Feline cats with their claws, paws and all
Caucasians eat frogs, African-americans eat the hog
Hindus in India will kneel to the floor and worship cows and rats as gods
I raise the odds, spit rhymes towards Mars and beyond to the nearest binary star
I'mma tell you once more my main man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man

I was taught my heart was my brain in my past life
I was thrashed in a fight over my passion for the mic
Risked the ultimate sacrifice to rhyme, askin' Christ why?
He replied; ""Passions like mine have a price""
They will grab you if you grab the mic
Try to squeeze the life from you, take away your life
There's only one way to fight
Zero gravity device, turn it on
Impale them on stalactites and stalagmites, alright?
I was hyped; he told me that every word I recite
Symbolically represents the whole world's kryptonite
Includin; but not limited to spittin' in the booth
Spit the truth; tell the leadership to listen to the troops
The leadership bleeds blue, we bleed red
In the end the only thing we can agree on is death
I beg you to get it together
To truly be clever you gotta be able to think ahead and remember
'Cause most of us have forgotten where we came from
Turned a blind eye to the energy that made us
I ain't the same Canibus I was
But I still get busy 'cause that's what Canibus does
The rhymes are relevant, they optimize your development
Food for thought, beverages should be free but they keep sellin' it
The mixtape comes out today, announce the date
The potato gets off his couch to wait
Cause he knows something wicked his way comes
They can hear the sound of the war drum, Canibus save them!
I can't save you, but you can save yourself
We can save each other, I just came to help
The event you can't prevent no matter how much you spend
Your catalogue remains thin no matter how much you pen
I stand with my men, lookin' at the flag-draped coffins again
Cryin', justifyin' what I did
There's no excuse cause nobody will ever know the truth
I will never get over the abuse - fuck you!...
*Pause*
I gotta keep Hip-Hop open, if they close it I'm homeless
If I lose it I'm broken, if I disown it I'm hopeless
I am a hopeless romantic Trans-Atlantic pimp
In the Pacific stickin' dick to Los Angeles bitches
Bitch please, be my guest
Shot her in the head while she slept
What would she dream about next?
I'm a maniac nigga, so fuck rap nigga
Bigorexia anxiety attack nigga
If you're loyal I'll murder for you, you disloyal I'll destroy you
Rhodesian Ridgeback will and turn on you
Keep Hip-Hop alive if you don't we die
We includes me, you, K-Solo and Nas
Keep Hip-Hop open 'cause if they close it I'm homeless
If I lose it I'm broken, if I disown it I'm hopeless

We've got infinite power
This is a story of a man that was before his time

In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternalist?
(Canibus)
Cause every time I stop or seem stuck
Soon as you try to step off, Canibus

My soul was created ten thousand years before my body
This album is a physical copy
Human life forms cybernetically upgraded to live at least twice as long
Who writes the song?
The latest technology platform is a robot that raps bars
I assemble parts down in my garage
Watergate telephone tap to your face
Annual spring gala, one billion a plate
No thanks man I already ate
But one day, I'd be honored
To have the authority to say grace
Lord we gather before you, the Almighty infinite
The one who created the eye in the pyramid
Time traveling Triads
Custom tailoring triangles trapped in a tetrahedron timelapse
They labeled me a loser
Germain's Online Observer Graphic Layering Entropy computer Metaphor styles, astronomer royale
Tesla coils around thought forms to separate clouds
Williams the conqueror, defender of the realm
The Adonai warcry in the pits of hell
Rippin' it, spittin' it, the quickening, the christening
Upgrading every innocent life form listening
I ain't wearing no toga to practice no yoga
Get closer, breath like an old moped motor
Pressure on the skull, never had a day that was dull
You a wild boy Bis, you a bull
Gas tank full, I'm a take 'em to school
Turn gravity upside down, watch everybody say whoa!
Type two civilization and reconciliation
Ten thousand bars plus spaceship
I'm out funded and outnumbered, fighting back with nothing
My equipment is efficient but rusted
I fight to protect yours, I fight to protect my own
So why am I such a helpless soul?
I did my best but my best wasn't good enough
I built a robot rapper instead of giving up
Success is failure turned inside out
Anointed, the universe is my God's house
Fear not, falling apart
Everything will fall into place when you organize and crossfade bars
The metaphors are so large they marginalize Mars
Acromegaly melodys dwarf rap stars
Returned for the rapture, first contact, first to contact us Negotiating terms of interaction
Aquatic humanoids interbreeding with land mammals
Keynote speakers reference PowerPoint examples
Check out my hermetic poetic planetarium
The alien came out of a female mammalian
Induce cesarean and bury him in bioluminescent aquariums
In a self-sustaining black light solarium
Then after that I live forever, you disagree?
You can't deny RTJ infinity
 x2

No matter how much time is elapsed on the ground
Canibus always got that Hip-Hop sound
Disagree to disagree until you side with me
But as usual I end up by myself my G
Don't be sensitive or facetious, call it how you see it
If the chips is down and it ain't around you don't need it
Vague mysterious memories, hard to remember what was said to me
I write so many bars intelligently
It's hard to stay motivated, I'm broken in so many places
I was chasing a dry oasis
Till I found something amazing in the adjacent matrix
I've been anticipating and waiting with a slave's patience
His music and rhymes have been neutralized
Everything he does online is supervised
We study his life and we know his mind
We will use his infinite theory in future times
But not right now, right now you just say wow!
Rakim Allah gave me my style
The argon cathodes increase RTR rap flow
If you ain't know before, now you know
By mechanical or digital means
I supervise emcees from annex one through ten and thirteen
The golden boy counts Hip-Hop by the troy ounce
Whenever ten thousand bars is announced
Communicated with a group of beings from elsewhere
They told me humankind was on spiritual welfare
They said it's not even they fault, they were simply influenced
Just like you, just like us all!
Extraterrestrial presence, not right now, I'm studying lessons
I don't even want to go in that direction
My literary creations are guided by God
Through literature and self own images, like that dog!
What we got here is a failure to communicate
Fuck you if you don't like the music I make!
I'm a God by nature, gold inside the trachea
But they forgot Canibus, they just gave up
I came to create the first infinite song
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Canibus about to flow long as he can possibly go
He built a robot to rap when he can't though
When I ain't got no more get up and go left
I struggle to take one more step, the Lord bless
Hip-Hop, give us back our promise our jobs
Community uplifters, altruistic bars
The light emerged, there's a glimmer out of a dark covenant
The dark came from nothingness
No matter what we do, no matter what we say
One day we will learn the error in our ways
Doublespeak confuse us, insecurities abuse us
We need to do better, the world can use us
Suffering is minimized not eradicated
Sanitation squad sterilize every sector allocated
A brand new world, for better not worse
If you dare to dream with me then mix a new verse
Celebrate with silence, satisfy with song
Ten thousand bars, why you took so long?
Canibus still bustin', they still say I ain't sayin' nuttin'
Canibus, what your major malfunction?
Nothing, the heart of Hip-Hop still pumpin'
She is my beloved and I am her husband
I built a robot out of wedlock to save the world
I save the world for my beautiful girl
My baby, my woman, my lady, my queen
She drive me crazy, but she tried to glaze me
Pretty eyes, the kind that glows with the eyelids closed
I don't know why I allow these hoes
Baby hold on to your tampons
She crawling out of bed with crampons and nothing to land on
Kissinger kissing Ginger and Jennifer
Straight genders touching genitals in a federal controlled experiment
I will do nothing to hurt you, only to help
There's a failure to communicate, go fuck yourself!
Microwave home cooked meal on the table
Bills in the mailbox, they cut off the cable
I need you to fill out that W-2 for that time I paid you
Write down how much time I saved you
Talk to the lawyer for the copyright appraisal
On the patent application for this rhyme I made you
Nobody cares, everybody got they own career
Rapping robots ain't paying no bills
Get out of my house, don't ever come back unannounced
You don't even know what this is about
Regret speech but never silence
Justice might be one sided, that's fine I got nothing to hide then
Spatially gifted, verbally inconvenienced
Love and support is all I ever needed
And when I had to go without, I was weakened
I felt cold, slowly breathing
Expiration is near and too close to fear
So just try to enjoy every moment you're here
Raise your children and embrace your visions
The science of infinite theory and composition

The megalithic master craftsman
(Rip the Jacker)

Closet meteorologist, look at the clouds, a storms coming
That's common sense, aight think about this:
Giant monstrosity, 10W40 blood viscosity
Big enough to kill the whole colony
Lock and load, get some
The oil leaking from the barrel drum
I did it all for dinosaur blood
The sky is falling, ocean levels rising from warming
Too much carbon, we all know the real causes
Jet planes in the skies are stalling
Dark Knight riot squads are forming, snakes are coiling
Rats jumping ship, but the water is boiling
Produce is spoiling, state of affairs appalling
Can't believe people still snoring, wake up and stop yawning
Vengeance is mine in the morning
Speech recognize speech, mobile phone signals out of reach
Data plan says your talk is cheap
The king is a captive, trapped by his own inactions
Celebrated after global disaster
That's when Father Author Poor Pauper was captured
His golden palace was collapsed in mist
Grey ashes that were once wide green pastures
With panthers, dragons, tigers, and rappers
Aight, these were the men of minor stature
The megalithic master craftsman
Rip The Jacker

Cubism and Futurism, writing amusing lyrics
My opinion of your opinion is you can't be serious

My brain ain't gettin' enough oxygen
I built a robotic Canibus and now nobody stoppin' us
Black hoodie in the streets, lumberjack fleece
The beast from the east 'bout to thunderclap beats
Ability verse baggage, drop it
Hip-Hop is toxic, I administer the detox process
All over the beat, I rap with my robot to feel complete
He can rap better than me
Not a hard thing to do to cut RTR loose
He gon' show every one of you he got the juice
Personal revelations regarding self preservation
Daily wealth generation, and healthy meditation
Cool. But I can't so I shit my pants
I'm ok, I go sit over there, you go dance
Have fun, go find romance
Can a matchbox man? No. But a tin can
Grant me the prow, Imma fix this thing
Give me the mic, Imma have to climb to sing
Lyric for lyric, layer for layer, prayer for prayer
They want the future thinkin' I'm a failure
Yottabytes of bars, essentially kept on cloud storage
Cause I ain't got the memory for it
I gotta do my best if I could barely pull my own weight
The Easter Island stone face told me to wait
Strength and vitality, the Arawak Indians dance for me
Half a dozen UFOs land for me
Seven billion minds couldn't control the mind of one
Controllin' solar flares coming from (the sun) Shan51


Sixteen the mixing boards channeling the mixing board
Channeling spirits like a ouija board they stare at us all
Evaporated terrestrial walk through the wall
To explain everything about reality to us all
The man knows who our grim wars
Masta matrix manifest miracle Moses into a crystal quartz orb
Smoke chemicals in Taj Mahal, I'm a danger to you all
Buttstock to the skull till the last man
Possess all knowledge known
The days of old when all lyricist were bold and they spoke from the soul
The oxygen I breath is a billion years old
We born to translate codes till something great unfolds
Animate ones and zeros, a sideways eight explode
My occipital lobe glow, remote viewin' the globe
Biological, electro, the truth of mine grows connective nodes Flows tabulated below, you already know

Unlimited meaning with words, beyond human reserve
Beyond being protected or served
College is a source for knowledge
So is Shan51, Commander Complex, and Rip the Robotic
Basel III compliant
The psychopath science of LIBOR clients that have to revise their diet
Produce their own food, export or supply it
Sell goods to the market that allow us to buy it
But what if inflation cripple suppliers
Setting off economic dividers that ripple even wider
The sunvisor chief analyzer, H.N.I.C improviser
Just don't get so excited
Over secrets that should not be told
And you should not be so bold
Who are you to judge how they roll
It's a cold world, yes indeed
But into achieving your dreams, then how can you regret what you've seen

Bunch of beats
Eight way sideways eight times C
Speed of light is how long it takes me
I suggest you leave Hip-Hop alone for your own safety
Ten thousand bars is crazy
To be nice I sacrifice things like no sleep

He doesn't exaggerate, he claims he was the first rapper in space
Ain't scared to say Rip the Jacker to your face
He was trusted but betrayed
His name led him to his grave, but not before he conquered his rage
What a marvelous day, gardening, parsing in the shade
Quite a change from his militant ways
He said one reckless action can pierce life's wards
But the tongues of the wise will bring healing from the wars
No matter where you go, there you are, standing before God
What does this have to do with a job?
IRA, 401K, I need the pay right away
Go away, ""silence!"" they say
No escape for the slave, trying to run is like joggin' in place
The Gulags are not very far away, Pompeii
Seven kilometers going the wrong way
Motherfuckers be reading GPS wrong all day

Meditate in a Time Machine
Mix back-and-forth with a laser beam
Scream like weapons you can't beat
I concentrate on everybody dreams by using a touchscreen
Billion of souls trapped between The American dream
The supreme being talks to Vishnu and Shiva
To move between shrubs and trees
Screen calls from the unseen, by a prophet, it musta been
I see project blue beam of the Hip-Hop machine
Understand what I mean
A bunch of fake niggas trying to create storyboard scenes
I will be redeemed, as odd as it may seem
I need data pattern stream, a helicopter news team
Try to scream, lighting bolts stream from the heat by the beach
I transform into a beast with wide teeth, tap that cheek
So why speak? Symptoms last for weeks
The best emcee in the world, Complex quoted, that that nigga is ill
Globally about to preach with a poetic masterpiece
Whenever the horns blow
Street sweeper from that beast from the east
Till the death, we are sworn to protect
Hip-Hop is eternal, we gotta live it till the end my friend
But I must rescind, I've got a murder to attend
Bitch please be my guest
Shot the Jacker in the head without breaking a sweat

Buddha, Allah, Yahweh, God
Baal, Jesus, Vishnu, Shiva, Om
A stealth pierces the cloud
Seconds later is followed by a sonic boom sound, the war starts now
Conventional or synthetic
Cooper nickel acetal titanium exterior shields and edges
Yeah I'll have a pumpernickel wheat with extra pepper
Sinuses acting up, it must be the weather
Strategic vector flight path, CIA staff
Got some pretty ass bitches, don't be such a tight ass
What's your profession? Poet Laureate, sin sense with seven
I converted infinity into a weapon
Shouted: ""Stop complaining, shut up unless you got a solution""
We looking at him, like ""What do we do sir?""
He said ""Nothing."" Then lowered his head
And said ""Everything will fix itself in the end""


Syllables deeply known globally
Upholding the Hip-Hop rosary, notably
Greatest mixers of all time supposedly

Extraordinary galactic emissary, but the designation preliminary

Bathe in heaven water, Van Allen belt holds up my boxers
Forever you motherfucking bastards!
Don't believe NASA, they're just meaningless babblings
Don't believe contractor with a satchel of answers
Proppa' the public propaganda, I am a cherubim commander
The fuckin' smell of gunpowder, rifle, and a rangefinder
The Dillinger spin cylinder, Mumbai murderers
Cold Crush supernova, we underground warriors

The shoulder I shoot with is separated stupid
You think you got a better shot than me? Then do it
Now you got the juice, stop the music
Silence, I want you to hear what the truth is
I wanna see humankind rise
I wanna see it with my own eyes
I wanna see racism stop, I want aliens to listen to Hip-Hop
Haters misquote rhymes, pour turpentine down they throats
Let 'em choke with the bamboo vines
Arnold Schwarzenegger, movie screen casualty count
Between him and Sly Stallone they gon' carry you out (no doubt)
Overhead AWACS, wipe the whole place off the map
No excessive force, just rap
What kind of life you got?
You see me here rhyming with this robot
You know a brother love Hip-Hop
Love overboard, choppy water, high winds, and fog
Probably never make it back to shore
The world's crowded but I feel alone
""Imma always be there for you"" turns into ""now you on your own""
A life of service, no where near politician perfect
I'm glad the wife is a strong person
Imma forget you, but not if you special
Especially if your indiscriminately unsettled
Wherever you at, that's what you settle
Public program policy, pussy to pedal
Metaphors melt metal
Morphed into something that can be used by rebels to fight corporate devils
Raise the drawbridge, fuck you!
You are all dead men, walking, talking bout you awesome
Terabytes of lyrics, Yottabytes of spirits
Some criticize it, some like to hear it
Regulatory tell 'em the story, you have the right to remain silent
Charlie I'm sorry, please stop talking
Strength and vitality, the Arawak Indians dance for me
Because I commanded it to be
I pluck triggers like ukuleles with the strings missing
Wasn't ever into no ring kissing
Biological rhythms, always watching the bottom of women
My harem of Cleopatras, my kittens
When the invitation is given, do not go
The hair and nails of the undead do not grow
I ain't got enough teeth to properly eat meat
I can't barbecue cause property ain't cheap
Construction cost per square foot
Either we got to stay put, or we gotta find somewhere else to cook
When I'm satisfied I'll deliver
Take the arrow out of the quiver, RTR, come battle me nigga
X-ray vision, night goggle, Ripper block Google and Twitter
While I harness homing pigeons for biohazard contingents
All living organic conditions
Maybe this'll put your symptoms back in remission?
We spit so much things we don't know taking place
But they are taking care of everything everyday
Lyrebirds mimic my voice
The hardest thing to avoid turns out to be the simplest choice
I'm a deepwater dredge, till you get it through your motherfucking head
One day you'll remember what I said
What happens when seven billion minds couldn't match the mind of one?
Cause Shan solar flares coming from the sun
Composition none of your business
So what are you thinking? I'm thinking he's gifted
He should be under urgent care supervision
Was there anything he said or anything written?
He said these ten thousand bars were brilliant


And you maintain, you still maintain
This kind of evil can be combated

Fly robin fly, till you get shot out the sky
That's a cop out, nice try
Ten thousand bars means I'm a part of rap music forever
But I don't know if I want that pressure
That's why I built a robot to live out the legacy
Rip the Robot is the best emcee
They stealth detention is nothing, RTR is under construction
I can't wait till RTJ press the button
Like inspected gunship zone dumping
Maintainin' a holding pattern at altitude above cloud cover
Range: All the way out to Pluto and back again
And by the time it gets back rap won't exist
It'll have to be rediscovered
The history of it is not very uncovered, J to the blue-collar puppet
Accepted, applauded, rewarded
At sun down sheep will be slaughtered
Unless the blood of lamb makes an offer
We do not to negotiate with any enemy elements
Dragon, snake, eagle, rat, donkey, or elephant
Music for the meditative therapist
They call me a heretic but Poet Laureate never quit
Used to say ""Yeah I'll battle you, then reinvest the financial capital and build a robot to out rap you""
Now that's what I call a real rap star
The six-point facemask of the Jaguar

Shan51 flying around in the troposphere
Shan51 back spinning like molecules yeah
Shan51 come back to conquer this 2012
Shan51 the light bearer, the rhyme with divine layers

These revelations coincide with the equally accurate predictions of Complex
Both futurists included in their writings suggestions of an apocalypse

Matter of Time,Full Spectrum Dominance 2,2018,"The biggest blessings when the younger look out for the older
The older providing the shoulder to bolster the culture
We were just Ewok soldiers facing off much larger opponents
Stronger than ogres, mutated poisonous cobras
Media moguls with teeth like marsupial rodents
Sacha Baron Cohen open mic moments
Ask what you like, questions are loaded
You're likely to be misquoted, end up like Alex Jones did
In no time, culture vultures pick your bones by the roadside
As we inhale the potassium bromide
From 50 Shades of grey colored skies, demonetized by Russian spies
Why does a brother even try?
Go underground just to survive, above ground, nothing but lies
Paralyzed by the drugs they provide
Tranquilizer for the mind, available online
I declined, but that's why we need more time

There is no more time, depends on which clock you go by
Blow the chofar, pray to the rain god
What if we're not on the same side, but we came from the same tribe?
I don't know how to answer this guy
This old goon on iTunes, did you sign to him?
Did you give away your lies to him?
What about YouTube? I watched the reaction from TwoDudes
Straight through hypnotized by the lights in the room
Analytic brain food, Professor Griff type jewels
The creator gives you the right to choose
It feels like we fighting to lose when we don't know which narrative's true
But what the Khazarian crackers do?
What about devils with the blackest hue? Sell your black ass out, too
The root of evil captures every group
The number four jump traps snap loose
Break your spine and your back, too, just give me a beat I can rap to

Germaine and TwoDudesFromMaine talk about coons in the game
Who don't love hip-hop the same
The question is never satisfied, answers must be properly ratified
Find out how to resist and try
Sophia Stewart envisioned human androids dressed like druids
I wish I had the resources to prove it
Black lithium red mercury, alert orange level emergency
Poetry was never perjury
Then it occurred to me, if they can shut Alex Jones down
They can censor every poet in the whole world now
You ask how? Natives are restless, fatigues make behavior aggressive
A positive message is labor intensive

Who Shot Ya Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert
At 22 yards per second to catch me the daily delicatessen
With 30 minutes to eat 'em, 40 minutes to digest 'em
And 50 minutes for it to pass through my intestines
So ask yourself a question: Can the Canibus rhyme?
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine?
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you running by, trip you up from behind
My rhymes confuse niggas like somebody tryna gangbang
Wearin a blue shirt and red pants
Throwin up signs with their left hand, standin out on the corner at Wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband
God damn eggplants, y'all gettin me vexed man
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sanf
And I can't seem to get away from it, I dreamt that I stabbed Leviathan through the stomach and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, in the life before that
I played trumpets to warn you that I was comin
There's one billion ways to die and I already tried
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine
When I aim and fire my rhymes like a hundred cannon balls flying
Striking you one at a time in a parallel line
While the art of emceeing is steady dying
Canibus and Journalist bringin the rhyme
You against me.. No contest
My tongue hydraulics
Strong enough to flip a 64 Impala with 3 adult passengers
And a 400 pound driver
And drown you in less than an ounce of your own saliva
Rubberface rappers get, stretched like elastic
Claymation characters wit verbal vernacular
Slappin' ya, like a white water rafter
Or a Olympic kayaker, paddlin' across the Niagara
My afterburners'll be burnin' you after
Ya' body already been splashed with acid
And you turn to ashes
Assassins camouflaged in the grass blastin'
Leavin' blood all over ya' lady like Jackie Onassis
I'll fly ya' body outta Dallas
Perform plastic surgery while we airborne and switch caskets
Then lie to the masses
I'll tell'em that you got murdered over some East West beef, between rappers
Radio stations'll express they sadness
Play classics back to back and pass out ""Stop The Violence"" pamphlets
Just imagine, every night ya' girls screwing ya' best friend
While you in hell throwin' tantrums
I'll be lampin' in a mansion somewhere out in the Hamptons
Givin' some pretty ass bitch a spankin'
Nigga you can't win
I'm laughin' cause you a has been
You can't get ya' groove back
So don't even bother askin' Angela Bassett
You just get ya' ass kicked
Get ya' head chopped off and dropped in a basket
My left arm's taken but my right one's free
That means I could diss another muthafuckin' emcee
Wit rhymes that appear clearer than liquid crystal
My lyrical is more visual than television screen pixels
I fire pistols, hit you wit' miniature missiles
Riddle ya' body wit' holes then watch the blood sprinkle
Ya probably had no idea what you was gettin' into
On the mic, Can-I-Bus is invincible
Yo, yo, ayo, nobody can flow with Bis, rock a show with Bis
Or go toe to toe with Bis, none of y'all can coexist
We livin' in an Ice Age and its cold as shit
A hundred thousand dollar price range, niggas is frozen stiff
All I know is this, my felt tip hotter than hell get
A hundred eighty-six thousand miles per sec can melt flesh
Give a nigga a tan
Aerosol cans expand and explode in my hand
While I promote that new Canibus jam
Niggas feel it underground with stalactites hangin' from the ceiling
Live and direct
The illest emcee, and I possess the ability
To run at top speeds without bending my knees
I destroy shit, pinpoint astroids at orbit
Then hurl y'all thousands of miles per hour towards it
Goddamn heathens, grab my hands around your neck region
Then i start squeezin till you stop breathin'
You weaklins is playin tug-of-war wit ya tongues
I knock the teeth out ya gums and suck the breeze out ya lungs
Hit ya wit a blow your physical frame could never sustain
You’ll probably never walk ever again
Nigga, you think you rhyme sick? i leave you lyin stiff
Pull you behind my horse til i break ya spine, bitch
Stop cryin bitch, before i hit ya wit the iron fist
You can’t rhyme bitch, the one triple nine’s mine bitch
The pain’ll make ya voice change octaves
From low-pitched to high-pitched, every hour we kill a hostage
We judge mc’s by they lyrical fitness
And punish dj’s for puttin corny stickers on they mixes
Smack the stripper bitches for askin for my autograph and pictures
You’ll be scared to leave the club wit us
You stratch my back, i’ll scratch your’s bitch
I’ll eat ya salt-fish, if ya suck my sausage
I got an atomic sub, armed wit a sub-atomic scud
Ready to spill ya crimson-colored blood
Now on some battling shit, my verbal lateral grip
Keeps my tongue glued to the A-Dat when I'm tracking em swift
Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips
And make you rappers have fits cause I'm back in the mix
Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on a IBM
Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in
Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit
Meditating on this rap shit
Because my freestyle reigns sovereign
With a deeper conscience than the prophet Muhammad was born with
My brain cavity is enormous
My left hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven chakras
While the right one harnesses darkness
The type of dark that makes a house haunted
The type of dark that niggas get lost in
The type of dark you fear when you dead in the coffin
I hear you talking, but I ignore it
Cause it's garbage and your rhyme's boring
So keep standing on the corner
The trash man will collect you in the morning
Thug cats fronting, wacker than Blinky Blink
On the back of the wack ass Wagon babbling about nothing
Nah black, real hoodrats can get it on black
Meet me at The Tunnel where pussy cats get robbed at
Rubber face rappers get stretched like elastic claymation characters with verbal vernaculars
Slappin' ya, like a white water rafter
Or a Olympic kayaker, paddlin' across the Niagara

"Aids is Gold, HIV is Platinum",Z-Biscellaneous 1998,UnKnown,"Yo yo, I just appeared outta nowhere, 1980 was the year
Engineered as a biological weapon of warfare
Now with this I generate more fear
Even though back then nobody cared and people wasn't as scared
I never used to get so much attention
Most of the top contenders at the time I was good friends with
For instance, my man smallpox was hot
He used to SoundScan ten thousand a week and that was a lot
That nigga Hepatitis B, he was hyper than me
He used to get between twelve and twenty thousand a week
Alcohol was the neighborhood star
Bubbling
, drugs had niggas juggling
All kinds of controlled substances
My man cancer was like Charles Manson
Cigarettes almost made the Surgeon General ban them
Homicide was buggin' cause he had guns to amp him
And I was on the low lampin' cause I had a plan, kid

AIDS is gold, HIV is platinum
Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from
Five hundred thousand niggas in the hood with it
And a million more niggas is gettin ready to get it
AIDS is gold, HIV is platinum
Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from
Five hundred thousand niggas in the hood with it
And a million more niggas is gettin ready to get it

Yo, yo, now that millions is dead I'm considered widespread
Number one on the top ten and considered a worldwide threat
To all the kids, thirteen to twenty-three tryin
Sex, unsafe sex, you niggas need to use latex
H-I-V will progress to A-I-D-S
And transform your warm blooded bones to dry flesh
By stressing the immune system
Promiscuous men and women trying to avoid
Getting the microorganism in them
From running up in it raw
Ready and willing, a couple of minutes of a good feeling
Is what'll kill them
Break ya body down in steps, breath for breath
In the hospital with less than a dozen T-cells left

AIDS is gold, HIV is platinum
Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from
Five hundred thousand niggas in the hood with it
And a million more niggas is gettin ready to get it
AIDS is gold, HIV is platinum
Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from
Five hundred thousand niggas in the hood with it
And a million more niggas is gettin ready to get it

Yo, I went from ""Killing Them Softly"" to killing them harshly
Minorities from twenty to forty can't afford to ignore me
They do my dirty work for me - going to
Raunchy ass parties where they be having orgies to transport me
Through the semen and blood, needles and drugs
Choose which one of the two demons in evil you trust
Cause the only way I could be detected
Is by getting tested and most people don't question
The person they having sex with
As to whether or not they infected
Even the people you already slept with
Wouldn't suspect that they can catch it
Forty percent of the AIDS patients is Afro-Americans
And we only twelve percent of the population
That statement is a fact, latinos and blacks face it
It came straight from the World Health Organization
It's the iron fist scientist, slash rhyme-chiatrist
Here to diagnose that we dying quick

AIDS is gold, HIV is platinum
Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from
Five hundred thousand niggas in the hood with it

You better leave me alone
Badass M.A.N.P.A.D.S and drones
I follow slow, their footprints in the snow
They pigeon toed, they cooking with peanut oil
They gotta be close
I track the geese, take flight move east
Team real, tree fleece
They match rims on the pickup chief
I'm that p3 orion, dragon Judah standing next to the lion
With angels beside him and god behind em
The son of perdition wants to kidnap all of the women
And make slaves outta all of the children
Shinola hit the fan, the pine sol soils ya pants
You were warned - but you still in a trance
Brand new Lambroghini vans parked outside the Fema camps
Can't nobody change they plans?
You sat down in the chair and you crossed your legs
The next time you do that you'll be wearing depends
They took your picture up close - with a telescopic lens
They wrote a report that said you got terrorist friends
They all lies and more god damn lies
She got bedroom eyes, carmelized apples beef patty thighs
It ain't the brown mans fault - that the second Civil War jumped off
Who's his boss? Implicate the source
They got battle cruisers bigger than Cuba
With internet 2 computers, the front man is just one of they stooges
They control the information, they abuse it

The keys the nuclear closet is in his upper jacker pocket
Locked him up with a Nuwabian prophet

Rebirth is eliminated, we are rehypothocated
World domination predidacted by human lab rats
And dead cats that got ate by economic Mad Max
Platinum before I knew what platinum was
Got plaques, tried to exchange it for cash and got laughed at
Not funny, still don't nothing move but the money
If the dollar is devalued - you just another dummy
Derivative bubbles, quasi illegitimate puzzles
They chuckle in they bungalow till it crumble
If you were me, then I would be humble
Seek out those who love you
Seek the lord for you know he loves you
Avoid digital voo doo and these black swan gurus
Yeah, it's the end of the world and business as usual
Americans ain't stupid, they're just distracted
The good life was good for as long as it lasted
Primary audio circuit, fait accompli emergency service
Pay me up front for the verses
Any currency is good as long as it can be converted
As long as I can use it for my food item purchase
Or any emergency purpose, religious workers travel by permit
Mega bus merchants public transportation mergers
Good bad and ugly, all wanna grab your money
Brass monkey - uncle Sam be grumpy
He make sounds like star wars Chewy
But this ain't the movies
Trust me - this ain't the movies
Shell cases make beats when they touch the concrete
You might hang from a tree if you don't got a strong fleet

Break off a big chunk of skunk and take off with a blunt

Suited up, booted up, and I'm ready for war
Yo 'Bis, let's get it live, grab the tec-9, what else?

The Glock 9, and the double-axle forty-five
Bend your mental from the beginning to the end
It's connected to the beginning like infinity symbols

With an unsuitable coffin that's way too small
And a deacon blessing your body at your funeral
You get a 21 blunt salute, and life goes on
Gotta stay positive, focus on the protons
And post dope songs on mp3.com
As deep as a 2Pac poem, I wish I got to know him
Both him and Big Poppa was the greatest, and now they gone
What's Goin' On? On my album, I'mma do a song
Who Shot Ya? Remix featuring Shyne and Sean
Before I battle total strangers
I make em sign disclaimers, that state they're aware of the danger
See, I might become overwhelmed with anger
Split your skull like a banana, and bludgeon your face with a hammer
You wanna rhyme? Fill out this W-9
Sign below the dotted line, now your publishing's mine
I gotta have your publishing rights, hang you upside down
See if you scared of heights, remember Vanilla Ice?
Ask Paradise if I'm nice
I took the train to Chambers Street and blacked out on his mixtape twice
Back in '95, I was a tiny guy
You could see the hunger in my eyes, I just wanted to rhyme
And I'm Still in my prime, Still chasing down what's mine
Still, like Dre, but Jay-Z ain't writing my rhymes
Quick to say hi, and quicker to say bye
Take a flick with some guys, and leave before the Polaroid dries
""He was standing here a minute ago,"" the brother replied
""With his mind on his money and his money on his mind""
Reflecting over the times when I was signed
Selling records for ten dollars, but only a dime was mine
What's the odds of rolling two dice with six sides each?
As if there's only 36 ways to die in these streets
There's a million ways to die at the absolute least
One of those ways is messing with the Beast from the East
Aka me, aka the capital C
Ripping the Jacker with Paradise on MP3
Keep it locked y'all...",https://genius.com/Canibus-mp3com-freestyle-lyrics
Broken Thoughts Frozen Heart,Flight RTJ2: The Layover,2013,"Inside the detox box I watch the clock
Outside the box I'm supposed to protect Hip Hop
The physician of weirdness, bald and beardless
Only the minds of the independent can hear this
Civilian population fear this
Only authorized personnel beyond this point, where this?
The hypercube room I don't know where it is
Microphone terrorist bare fist with brass tips
Fuck with the Brass Monkey
Look up when honey's ass is above me
She a high class rap junkie
She's headless, with her face emplaced in her chest
Below her breast she a cosmetic bitch
The snake eats the canary
They issued an order not to come near me
No matter how bad I sound when they hear me
Half man half wolf I daredevil off of the roof
And land on both tubes so don't move
Pounce teams listens to Al Green
Everybody in town dreams
That they saw the same cloud screen
The Majestic Mic Master Messiah
Kappelmeister the rhyming meat grinder
Code Name: Shadow Viper
Metalic hawk talons knock sharks off balance
Even went to see a play called Hamlet in all Spanish
Everyday that goes by I feel less important
If I'm right, I'll be nonexistent by the morning
Don't you spit 'One More Bar'. once barred
You may not stand for ten years or more are you sure?
Climbing the pyramid two blocks at a time
'Til I'm face to face with Optimus Prime
'Bar War' rap in the Temple of Karnak
The wolf has no constituent need to bark back
Put your ear to the phone, it takes them three seconds
To pronounce the true casualty rosters' death tones
Rocket propelled bars from Alaska's largest national park
Where helicopters crash in the dark
The eagle was a phoenix, the phoenix is a zenith of a greater meaning
You are reading what I'm seeing
Lyrically theoretically I'm Schiaperrelli
The meaning behind Cydonia is so interesting
'Old Man of the Mountain' from New Hampshire
Says fire, live free, or die or retire
C-c-cold Leopold his whole bottom row solid gold
He possess all knowledge known
The verse I write is manufactured thermite
Spore bearing life forms come to life on the mic
Perigee and Apogee, your rhymes trapped in my gravity
Something that we understand naturally

Metaphor Meteors,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Born, raised, corn's what I eat when I graze
Served to me on gold trays
Sip grape haze, sunny days, ocean waves
Always with a bird on those days
In the cantina with a canteen of green
Yeah, me and my team, they think we from Queens
Evisu jeans, white-Nike's with white wings
If the recoil springs, the snake-bite stings
Bow before what the Great Light brings
Lightning makes the sky look stripe-pinned
Cranial capacity: Twenty-five hundred CC
You can rap, but you can't see me
My emotions echo, I let go into the threshold
I grin, my limbs get cold
Death to any and all who disrespect Lyrical Law
That's the main motor-jaw protocol
Here's my software: load it all
Questions? Any time after 11:34 is good to call
The graveyard watch, I still believe in Hip-Hop
It's just changed so much that it's not
The sane: I ask myself, “Am I still Germaine?”
Let's not go through that again
The name Can-I-Bus, my music career seems stuck
But I'm the only one they can trust
Shut up, let me ‘Bus
Rhymes will engulf the Sun, which in turn will engulf us
I called because I had to tell you
What to do when your resources fail you
Banned from the Internet, can't email you
I put it in a rhyme, the details'll scare you
IQ boosters for iPod computers
My job is to preserve yours and my future
Special Ops, they fast-rope out of an Osprey
I got mustard wings the odd way
With God's grace I served Hip-Hop
And was not replaced, at least not to my face
Now I'm all alone, drinking Patrón
From a bowl shaped like Skull and Bones
Your man not home, leave a message after the tone
No call-back until you massacre a poem
I exhale weed smoke, built a dream boat in the placebo
With Captain Nemo and three hoes
Fine little Fräulein, soon she'll be all mine
I'll pour wine to shorten the foreplay time
She turn to me slow like, “Honey, where will we go?”
I proposed it was best she didn't know
Verbal, psychoneural, she said, “I never heard of you
Your words are purposeful, I might learn a few""
Special collection service track down every beat purchased
Researchers read my incomplete verses
The verses were first-string, left-wing, second-wind, then combine, created a third thing
My heartbeat ends when the Devil and God become friends
The Hip-Hop Tribunal will begin
Cry for the crisis negotiator, codename: Major Omega
Crisis situation in the bodega
Gun bolt long as a trombone, the weapon itself; big as Mutombo
Them niggas was humble
Practical things like tactical slings, LBV retractable springs
D-rings pinch my clavicle skin
Stay in the underground base, excuse the décor
Everybody leave your body armor at the door
I drop rhymes like rockslides
The seismic size compromise lives, but not mines
I find time to regroup and switch suits
While they shoot from a stone proof booth with no roof
My flow is the truth, a Hip-Hop glucose boost
And everybody else know it too
Step forward, touch the speaker, activate the DNA reader
Looks like we got us a tweaker
Atomic-ganglionic chronic microphone hydroponics
With incompetent psycho-content
The lone inventor, the experimenter
Of a scientific splendor that will always be remembered",https://genius.com/Canibus-metaphor-meteors-lyrics
Even The Odds,Full Spectrum Dominance,2018,"The odds are the dark star's not very far off
Toxicology report said he had an elephant heart
I'm like a Gollum with greasy hair
And a creepy stare born on a leap year
Meet me there, let me see if you care
Crawl from the ocean onto the land
Complete the plan, deeply tanned
Face, feet and hand covered with beach sand
Feed off freshwater seaweed
Mini stools looked like bb's
Stood on a throne of wreathed sea leaves
Neti pot, clean flush, nasal confetti snot
Just because I let her sit on my face, maybe not
Exercise alone eating cold stone ice cream cones
Measuring Yellowstone with temperature probes
Grass dont grow, wack-o-mole, facial expression wax bold
Gamma radiation from black holes attack souls
Drone pilots report they was attacked by giants
I say every survivalist is Darwinism Compliant
Bruce Lee, brother Noon Sea on a Chinese junk
We could use the island over there where these beats came from
I'm a dark radiant super-sapian grafted onto an alien
Who cloned himself to listen to Germaine again
Canibus Atticus Finch suspense thriller about to go to print
In bold ink, you cold-blooded old bitch
Canibus, Thanos, my nigga Thirst the Howl that came over to armwrestle on a three-legged table
Make America Mexican!
My A-team like Gregory Peck and em
Mr. T bodyguard the President
Murdoch is Marduk, top gun like Tom Cruise
Making a bomb run on Kim-Jong Un!
This is real life, fool it ain't no cartoon
Get a clue, hot barbeques and ice cold brews
Nothing new under the sun, but what if we got two?
Full Spectrum Dominance bro, coming soon

The odds are they fear the perfect(?) energy
Move with the energy, they in the lead
But I stay grounded like a centipede
The teeth 2000, the housing, scanning all the hieroglyphs
Stuck in microchips, gas clocks kept him alive to flip
More flow than Poseidon, I do not ?
Higher than a world of tyrants where they want your Gods silent
It's Beelzebub! Witness hell or bust, soon as he felt the scud
Destroying humanity like the time that God held the flood
The country's fucked! Trump is creating an Elmer Fudd
Bela Lugosi celebrating over the smell of blood
Wise like the cyborg with global red eyeballs
Fighting with my human side shining when the light's off
War biochemical, airborne I will end you
Suffocate till you're dead, tryna breathe through an inner tube
And everybody call it conspiracy gossping
But you will see when you start paying for oxygen",https://genius.com/Canibus-even-the-odds-lyrics
Tha Dungeon,My Name is Nobody,UnKnown,"It's like this y'all, Canibus y'all
About to rip y'all with the raw shit y'all
With my hard core raw dog Kurupt
'Bout to blow this shit the fuck up
It's 2000 B.C., 'bout to take it to 2000 A.D
Yea, my mother fucking man Ray on the track
Check it out

It's 2000 A.D.: After Disaster
Fly's buzz around a million rappers cadavers
Never been the type to talk
My ice-grill's like, looking down the wide jaws of a white shark
'Bout to rip off your arms like perforated paper
A hundred times more sharper than stainless steal razors
Shock you with an electrically charged taser
'Till you turn blue in the face, and die from asphyxiation
The stench of a thousand ounces
Grab you by the throat and blow my second-hand weed smoke down it
Don't give a fuck what month you dropping in
I'll be in the Dungeon hollering, 'fuck you and your cult following'
You cum-swallowing transsexual fag
With crabs, and breasts that sag, dressed in drag
Running full-paged ads in the porno mags
With pictures of you with a dick in your mouth and a dick in your ass
Kurupt where you at?
Yea, the Dungeon style
Yea, the dungeon
Yo
Lyrically, I'm bananas
My tongue moves like Hindu bellydancers performing tantra
I blur your vision like slow shutter speeds on the camera
Get up in that ass like colon cancer
Brain cells handpicked
Organically enhanced with third millennium medical standards
My D.N.A. was tampered with
By genetic engineers with scholarship grants that studied at Stanford
Canibus, too advanced for this shit
Turn spit to gas vapour, then back to spit
Your style is one-quarter bull, one-quarter horseshit
One-quarter garbage, and one-quarter nonsense
Make you nauseous 'till you vomit
Like the Backwards Pharcyde video going forwards
As I drink the blood of a thousand emcees
I can tell by the taste of the pulp if they was hand-squeezed
This is Transylvania, vampire mania
You should be afraid of my fangs in your neck draining you
I was made to bust, made to crush
Any mic me and Kurupt touch, turn to dusk
See? I'm as dangerous as they come
Dangerous with or without a gun, I've been dangerous since day one
Rhyme flows explode like pyros
Stick to your ribs like chicken and thick gravy from Roscoes
Get your head blown if you dumb in the dome
Or struck with some stones 'till you feel numb in the bones
You better keep your big mouth closed
'Fore I stick the muzzle of the chrome in that hole under your nose
Send a signal to my index, and tell it to fold
In the direction of my wrist bone to release your soul
I told you to freeze, if I was you I would have froze
But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes
Pistol to your mug, cripple your tongue, rip through your lungs
Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood
Give me a little love
There anybody out there that never felt one rhyme that Can-I-Bus bust?
You a liar, liar, pants on fire
Watch the G.O.A.T. with the ghost-writer get slaughtered by a tiger
Seen him in the Pun video holding up his lighter
Smeared his career like doo-doo inside a diaper
My style is sicker than, infected women and men
I'm so raw, I can catch AIDS without sticking it in
Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi
Switch language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
And we do it like that when we in the dungeon
Past the motherfucking mic to Kuruption",https://genius.com/Canibus-tha-dungeon-lyrics

Ghetto people song, only them can sing this one

They say the devil's time is short
So what, sport?
We still ain't free
They still lying on radio and TV
The centuries turn into minutes; humanity's finished
Forced organ harvest, what's for dinner?

Butcher the meat
Chop up the pig
Dig out him ribcage
Blue mountain ridge
Fire burn hot
Ital in a' deh pot
Women head wrap up, she walk round in frock
Bobo dread, wattah bom, Maroon sing-song
How long ya deh a foreigner in a Babylon belly man?
Then you no know?
Fire shot fling stone
Di whole time deh deh a suffer in a mi soul
Bad man dun a van tear off Jah

Ghetto people song, only them can sing this one

Bareface, they kyas and clean up the place
I sent a  buy front bricks
Man upon road no tek catch a buss man
I know man I still buy ore
Substance dominate rhymes
Styles trail closely behind
They work together, you don't need to choose sides
Dystopian present times, immigration talk to a leprechaun
Motherfucker ain't no friend of mine
If he's worth his weight in sodium, step to the podium
Ingest the polonium
While promoting electroneum
Crypto-sporidium
The next coin for the millenium
Check the chlorine levels before you swim in it

Meta-Fortnite, nano-mic; volcano cancel your flight
Ash in the air, clash of the titans
Man-made throwing fertilizer in the fan blade
DNA de-energize by high gamma waves, slaves
Close to old age, told to behave
The youth strayed so far from the way they were raised
More locks, more keys, more prisons, more thieves
If pedophilia's a crime then why they go free?
I rarely generalize, but who goes to parties to consume drugs wrapped in cheese brie
Inquiring minds don't give a *flllluck* what you know
They just wanna see the deposit slips, yo
Relocate, move in with grandpa
Meanwhile Grandma goes in to live with prince bandar

Authentic Level Of Greatness,Full Spectrum Dominance,2018,":
Ladies and gentleman

I have faith that the youth has to save the day
We gotta let the chips fall where they may
Feud Elvis paved the way, however I'm ashamed to say
The foundation just faded away
I told the limelight bovine in the coalmine
Sometimes it gets so dark your soul can't shine
What you do when justice takes years or more?
But your world is 24 hours from being destroyed
No time machines to tamper inbetween reality
No time for apathy or religious fantasy
Just you against the dragon beast
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
I dont know. That's why I'm asking you
Ima die on my feet like my favorite OG
My favorite OG ain't dead yet, blame it on me
Stay frosty, wake up like ""bitch, get off me!""
And I don't calm down till I taste my coffee
The blind man told Batman ""No rope""
That's the only way to get outta this hellhole
Just be honest, you made a false positive promise
The rap artists piling up like ocean garbage
:

So operative bullnose, full blown turbo flow
You motherfuckers don't deserve no dough
They got a U.S. Republic minority budget
To start a school for Hip-Hop, nonprofit or public
You see, anybody that tells you they coming to save you? Is lying
'Cause you gotta save yourself
No matter what happens in the spiritual world of action
They wanna be compensated to hell
When they deal with they own they pull the trigger too late
But everyone else get dealt with, they don't hesitate
No mercy, no time to marinate
They ain't satisfied till we all living in terror-state
Guess what, we'll get used to it
Ain't nothing new to us
Adapt to the just, that's how we used to do it
Destructive humans, disruptive underground acoustics
They totally destroyed our music
:
:
Stripped of our honor; laid down to rest in the garden
Martyred, no chance of posthumous pardon
Too bad, ragtop Jag, Sugar Hill swag
Ride around with the top down listening to jazz
'Cause y'all act like y'all so much better than cavemen
But all that knowledge just brought you enslavement
Sentient awareness, removed
Dumbed down in a careless mood, I'm barely amused
So much more pressure than ever
Should the predecessor be more or lesser than their successor?
Good question
Unapologetic regret, questions still go unaddressed
How we feel now is anybody's guess
During this age of iron and widespread gun violence
The puppet masters strings are now wireless
Blindfolded, one more cigarette
What's your last request?
Maybe that life can outlast death
In a metaphor turf war, the all time great work horse
War of the worlds, just for the sport
On the other hand, I got faith, the youth gotta save the day
We gotta let the chips gotta fall where they may
The elders didn't pave the way

The assignment: to reduce all molecules and pass through solid confinement
The only way you could flooowww *slows down* iiisss iiifff
I liquidize your rhyme
Consequently blowin by me crystalizin your mind

Claimin we were mutants of artificial insemination

Peep the vindication indeed
Think tank full when you blink, think synchronicity
Rob three banks at the same time through Multiplicity shine

Siege a soldier and hold men for ransom
Stop procreation, chop they cocks off so they can't come
Block off a forty mile radius, bomb your fan base
Seeds are abnormally born and scorn wit a man's face
Indeed watch the moon bleed, we lead by example
Loop my life in time, stretch it in a nine like a sample

I'm pretty stupid, dumb enough to ask a fella ""Can-I-Bus?""
I ran, I rushed, I played it like a cello string
Barely get hellos in the morning but we wrestling
AM to the PM I'm preparing for the execution
Stop bein sexist cause you weak as hell (I'm gonna do this fo' sho')
I got the tent up in my hood with the chicken and the tater salad
Listen and you'll make it past this
Christian name, not quite a Christian rapper
Wait until I'm finished, make yo' silly comments after
Grown woman, not quite a girl rapper
You only bustin open a book, learn the chapters
Rapid fire comes the path to ghetto life
And that's word to EL-P, I sleep when you're fertilizer
I'm a, street talker, ghetto chemist
You ain't a starter; I ain't finished
Look at me boy, in my eyeballs
You ain't pullin shit~! This is my stall
I'm a beauty, I'm a beast
I'm as stingy as I wanna be, I'mma fest
You're a fish in a school of whales
And baby school won't be the only thing you fail, you fail

I'm a, street talker, ghetto chemist
You ain't a starter; I ain't finished boy
You only bustin open a book, learn the chapters

There once was a boy, his name was Jack
He changed it to Rip so that he could rap
There were those who observed to memorize what they heard
They enjoyed the rhymes and the sounds of the words
Such glorious poetry interwoven into code
Rip had written something that would never grow old
On the night of the Ripper's Eve
Little boys and girls would sit with crossed knees and begin to read
About lights in the sky, little green men with big eyes
Their short size is only a disguise
Sipping hot cocoa slow in the middle of the snow
If you can spit a flow, then off to Ripperland we go
Any Quantum of Solace is brolics, Germaine Bond is modest
I wrote my first doctorate in confinement
Between the choices I have made and choices made for me
Reminds me of a story I should tell you in the morning
I moistened my fingers and turned the page
I must say, you're very sophisticated for your age
I'm amazed you never have to be told to behave
You raise your hand to speak and respond to your name
I remember... the day I had changed
The way I was struck by lightning in the rain
Maybe some other time I'll tell you what I became
I can tell you that I've waned in the pain of my shame

It is etched into every metaphor from within",https://genius.com/Canibus-ripperland-lyrics

I walk where no man dares
So the world could share one man's fare

Your tears are my tears
When you talk to God, I eavesdrop on your prayers
I eavesdrop on your prayers
The industry could not stop my career
Fuck your record sales, where's your skills at?
You gotta million fans, but you're still wack
I can't feel that, what they've been exposed to is not real rap
Real rap is like chemical crack
I'm drippin' by my addiction is stealin' and bring it back
I prove it on every single track; I prove it on every single track
This is real Hip-Hop before it became rap
Do these magazines mention that? NO!
Does radio pay attention to that? NO!
Do they thank us for representin' that? No!
You think I let 'em get away with that? NO!

My man Canibus, gon' rip shit down, ha ha

Lost Boyz the beasts from the east up in this piece
With a new release on the streets every 52 weeks
And I dare a nigga to challenge us, I turn the Love, Peace and Nappiness into your blood on a napkin in the ambulance
Fucking with the nigga called Canibus
Just the sound of my voice will give you a positive urine analysis
I'm a lyrical demon, stronger than crack fiends
That smoke two P's with a C in between em
LB Fam, makin the music niggas dance to
And we sip a very substantial amount of Jack Daniels
L-O-ST, B-O-Y-Z we lock shit
We invested all of Legal Drug Money profit
Showing love to each and every nigga that copped it
In they Jeep, Lex Coupe, Bima or Benz knockin it
Music makin you high, giving you that urge
To spend two-thirds of the money you earned on herb
You're fuckin with the LB Fam, we do what we gotta do
You never get the chance to shoot back at who shot at you
Nigga, you'll be dead before you reach the hospital
Lookin at you layin there with blood comin out your nostrils
Queens most wanted, quick to clap a nigga
Rap at killers who wear Carharts and Caterpillers
Totin the four-pound, holdin the fort down
Before Heavy D bounced till Uptown became a ghost town
Cheeks, Lou and Thai see eye to eye
Spig sees eye to thigh, bein the shortest
But he still gets busy on the one and two's regardless
Heard about the Clue tape, so I had to get on it
Lost Boyz and Desert Storm, Show Us the Money
Cause we STILL hungry, we STILL got the growl in the tummy
We STILL grimy and grungy, dressin bummy
Doin shows for foreign currencies in other countries
Tryin to finance me a Humvee with low monthlies
Get a production deal, start our own record companies
Sign our own acts, and rhyme about whatever we wanna rap
Decorate our walls with plaques
Summertime eighty-nine or better degree weather
'97 DJ Clue and LB Fam forever

WHAT?! DJ Clue, all up in ya area

Yo yo yo hold up I don't think niggas know man
I'm gonna rock some more, check it out, yo, yo

Now just by watchin you, I can tell that I got you
To face me, somethin you don't wanna do, my rhymes
Are too hostile, they'll beat you down in public like the cops do
Sit on top of you, make a human pinata out of you
Flow as potent as possible, creatin obstacles Three Feet
High and Rising, like the chronicles of Posdonus
The old school hip-hop, is where I get my style from
Uptown Harlem, is where I get my lye from
My cousin with mad guns, is where I get the nines from
Area 51 is where I be gettin rhymes from
I'm not a human being
I'm the human being ill with a I.Q. that's off the scale
If words could kill, a verse of mine'll murder a mil'
And MC'sll be gnashin they teeth, burnin in hell
I'm learnin to be the head instead of the tail
I ain't followin nobody else to increase my sales
Metaphors are real, like they been forged in steel
Stood before the judge told him I was forced to kill
And how I went for mines to get Paid in Full
Then I went for minds again and ripped em out of niggas skulls
The nigga on the block with the biggest balls, layin niggas
On the floor, robbin em to a Biggie Smalls song
Turn your head round, give me the cheddar
I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever

The Lullaby of Champions,Lyrical Law,2011,"Goodnight… don't laugh don't cry
I'll never leave you
So just close your eyes
Couldn't deceive you
So fall deep into sleep to my lullaby

I recorded this in solitude
Probably the only opportune moment to talk to you
I'ma hold hands and walk with you, all of you
I honor you plus I got a lot of jewels to offer you
I know each of you got jewels to offer too
But only if the world knew what was possible
The gods and the goddesses above they watch us
While fallen angels make obstacles to stop us
Fear shuts down the evolution process
Chaos, that's what they want to accomplish
They usher in law and order through the back door
Start a massive war, enact martial law
Nah, the real samurai stand up
Atomic Godzilla just fucked Japan up
Think about it, they say Haiti had bad luck
I say, “Man up, their leaders just abandon them”
What happened to the donation relief dollars?
I'll tell what happened, it went to them leader's pockets
They use fear and confusion to control us
Tell us to donate then rob us for our emotions
They pretend to lead the people like Moses
As the Rapture approaches they escape in the commotion
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They believe in me too, so I ain't gonna leave you

 (Overlaps Chorus)
The first shall be last and last shall be first
That concept was here before man was on Earth
It's not gonna get better before it gets worse
And no matter what, we gotta do this light and dark work
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They want you to see the truth through the evil
They want you to know that ignorance weakens you
And they want us all to recognize that we are one people

I came to tell you that the Elohim believe in you
And the righteous never have a right to deceive you
You've never seen me do nothing greedy or unreasonable
And that's cause I ain't ever gon' leave you
Canibus was put here to ride with you
And build our faith up to fight the impossible
I ain't preaching brother, I'm saying all we got is each other
Forget what those motherfuckers promised you
I love you and I honor you
The God honest truth is that I would do the same thing if I was you
Comet 911 is coming nobody saying nothing
But we gotta figure out what to do

 (Overlaps Chorus)
The first shall be last and last shall be first
That concept was here before man was on Earth
It's not gonna get better before it gets worse
And no matter what, we gotta do this light and dark work
I came to tell you that the angels believe in you
They want you to see the truth through the evil
They want you to know that ignorance weakens you
And they want us all to recognize that we are one people

Chaos, death, and destruction is near
I pray these words don't fall on deaf ears
Comet 911 is almost here
Do the research and find out for yourself
Stop waiting on somebody else to help
Be proactive, save yourself",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-lullaby-of-champions-lyrics
HRSHU Attack,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You need to stop worshipping that Evil
And you better stop swearing on your people
You Hollywood, hip-hop don't need you
You sold your ass so hip-hop don't believe you
You ain't proven
I don't know who the fuck you think you're foolin'

What are you, a lyrical bodyguard, starstruck over the bodies you guard?
With pajamas on, what the fuck you rhyming for?
Fee Fi Fo Fum, the forty ton dinosaur with smoky lungs
Nigga, where you know me from?
Thoroughbred hip-hop head,
 hip-hop ain't shit without knowin' the ledge
That's what the God said
I smoke polly green, turn into Charlie Sheen
Fuck the honor roll if hip-hop don't wanna honor me
Fuck off the deep end, gimme the beat man
I'm twelve albums deep, you just getting your feet wet
Beast from the East, bitch, never been beat yet
You can't afford war without beats and respect
Listen, I don't want to rub it in, you acting like that's your husband
But this is mutual assured destruction
Look up, you see the space in the stars?
Don't create a facade, your arms are too short to wave at God
The lunar base god, in a rate beyond space PARCS
I was sent to the planet Earth to to examinate bars
To determinate whatever contaminates Lyrical Law
I'm like Negar bitch, 
in a space war with J-Rod
I don't have to play the race card
I just grab the eight card, aim at your jaw, tear your face off
First thing in the morning, treat it like a day job
Mixing Johnny Walker with napalm
I hold your nose and make you open mouth and say ""Ah""
The hip-hop H bomb, say something, I can't wait to respond
Run up in your dressing room like Raekwon
You act hard when the videotape's on 'cause you hate to be wrong
Well let me tell you something, nigga, this is lyrical law
A spiritual bomb that could cause physical harm
With a beef? Nah, you act like a miserable broad
A three-sixty deal means you getting circled by a shark, boy
Better beg your pardon, 
turn into a HRSMN and slaughter him
I'm an Undergod, you're too overconfident
So stop talking, nigga, cause you could all get it
W-A-R, nigga, I'm raw with it
Don't let the alcohol fuck with your soft vision
I'll knock you out of the park, nigga, long distance
I wrote this rhyme in five minutes
I'm like ten Ghostface Killah's in twenty-five disses
So fuck with this if you want to, nigga I'm bomb proof
It's like you on Twitter with nobody to talk to
Bust this rhyme fifty-nine times with a horseshoe
It's on you nigga, don't say I didn't warn you
Never had enough rhymes to fuck with mine
You know what they calling you right? Moist 5'9""
Heh, you souped up because you got signed
You getting so much shine you going fucking blind

Hey yo, 5-9, 
you must be out your rabbit-ass mind
Huh, for real or what?
I'm finna get some, y'all niggas lined up
Before it's over, I'mma show you what it is
I'mma show you why they kicked me out of the biz
Them niggas ain't trying to let me live
I ain't gonna end up like 'Pac, you dig?
Without a fight you understand me?
Fuck ya'll niggas, fully automatic trigger mechanism
You know my name nigga
What? When I say ""-Bus,"" it going to hit you up
Cash money, nigga
Ain't a goddamn thing funny, nigga
You heard? Fuck the battle
We ransacked two Shady castles

Get outside, get your ass in the saddle!
Just slaughtered, alphabeted like Papoose
What you drinking? That look like wack juice!
Come at you! Your rap group versus my rap group!
Cross sabers, spurs and black boots
Duck, duck shoot, nigga, get at you
Don't take yourself too serious, man
It's only hip-hop alright nigga? Peace!",https://genius.com/Canibus-hrshu-attack-lyrics

Rock! Rock! Rock!

Jump up and down if you love the sound
We Rip and Rock until we tear shit down
Rip Rock stands for Hip Hop mixed with Rock 'N' Roll
I'm hardcore to my inner soul
Hold on as I swerve outta control
Directly into the unknowns of a black hole
All my real niggas with fucked up neurotransmitters
Waving Glocks and swastikas
I'ma take twenty shots of this hard liquor
And swigga till I'm drunk as the Pississippi River
Even though I know the shit is fucking up my liver
Tomorrow when I wake up, I won't even remember
How I got home or where I got this tattoo of a mic on my arm from
Or when I fucked them bitches last night, I should of used a condom
(I guess not) Now that's what I call Rip Rock!

Rip, Rock, Rip (c'mon) Rock
Rip, Rock, Rip (c'mon) Rock
Rip, Rock, Rip (c'mon) Rock

C'mon! {*echoes*}
Rock!
Rock! Rock! Rock!

I want you to sucker-punch whoever you standing next to
If you ready to rock with a ReFugee rebel
A Navy Seal underwater in a submarine vessel
Shitting on niggas above sea level
I'm tired of you MCs talking about loot
I'm tired of you corny drug-induced Rap groups
I'm tired of the lies, the cries, the screams
Tired of getting my name misspelled in magazines
I'm tired of you two-faced disc jockeys
Non-believers, sucking on my arch enemy's penis
You know who you are, I'm talking to you
You need to recognize I'm tryna introduce something new
Something I would sacrifice my life and die for
Something if I was already dead I would rise for
Something that would make a fool a hundred times wiser
Something that will help all mankind to prosper
I die with laughter, looking at you wack MCs
With your craft unmastered, bastards
Hip Hop in it's rarest form
Crossbreeded with Rock 'N' Roll, now Rip Rock is born
Motherfuckers!

Liquid Wordz,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"It's very difficult to know if...
Northerners are puppets, or...
They are innocent, or...
They are the masterminds

These are 'Liquid Wordz'
Yo, I come through on cold steel on back of the snowmobile
I just came back from shogun hill
Make you kneel, face the wall
Shoot you in the back of the head with some paint balls
'Til your brains are gone
Attack dog, attack man, only respond to German commands
Completely bite off the burglar's hands
Triangle of death, that's where I purchased the land
Built the ranch, drilled deep into the Earth through the sand
Send the clergy emissary to the cemetery
You requested to be buried, with your bones to carry
I'm blood sample savvy, I name your first clone Jerry
Your second clone Harry, and your third clone after me
The fourth clone could battle him after he battles me
But your fifth clone can only be used as cattle meat
This is called microphone savagery
Press play, I attack the beat, you will tap out or tap delete
But we do not have to beef, before the Greeks captured Crete
I was known as the master of the beat
Sidonian MC speak, rudimentary speech
I released the Canaanite beast and sent 'em to the East
To walk through the streets sharin' thoughts about God and my beliefs
'Heavy Mental' it was authored by the Priest
We were tortured by the palm trees in the Palm Sunday breeze
It was 001 A.D

Yo, it's been a long time comin', but I'm finally here
Solidify my spot and I ain't gon' nowhere (C'mon)
Cause Ripper Mics been only 'vice
So I return like Christ, to resurrect the art of spittin' nice
The true and livin' it, physical form
Grab the mic and I - spit up a storm
Tracks get beasted, MC's get eaten
I blast paragraph from rough draft - the thesis
With strong facial features, lip and gap teeth's
I see through your feces like telekinesis
Build with Killah Priest in the chamber of Gizas
Special Ops Hip-Hop get chopped in pieces
Zero degree Celsius liquid will freeze
But at any temperature, settle melt MC's
That's why Canibus handed me the scrolls for infinity
What he actually gave me was the moment of clarity
It's complex simplicity, self-contradictory
Philosophical speak about the God and men mystery
Cause we've been fooled by religion and history
Cause the path to eternity, starts eternally
Accordin' to the sundown, the time is at hand
For me to reveal to man, exactly who +I Am...+
I'm the apostles, we writin' The Bible and Ebonics
I'm Elijah Muhammad that'll sell chronic
Martin Luther with a German Lugar
I'm Malcolm X on your project steps bustin' a tec
Gandhi with a MPC, who MC mad nice
I'm Christ in his cipher shootin' dice

Inside my mind is bad weather
So when I brainstorm it'll rain strong
To Hurricane's swarm in a form of paragraph
Start from the corners of the pages in my pad
And nothin' could withstand the rhyme, when it rages in its path
But I don't brainwash my listeners
My lyrics give 'em a bath, without bars or soap
These are bars of quotes, that'll take you so far you'll choke
What I have is like lightening in a bottle
Deep as the writin' of Aristotle
Like Picasso but it's a novel
Spittin' in bars and flows, Priest the dark Dragon King
Spittin' graphics of scenes, my sixteens should be seen on plasma screens
My black wings are Lord of the Rings
While my sword is bathin' and y'all scream
Swallowed your flesh to his metal intestine
It feeds so much on your rebels that it became congested
And gnarls on bones, snarls at thrones, carve out domes
Somewhere in a giant stone King where the interest is big enough
To accommodate a Pterodactyl in flight
Priest sit and the Tabernacle will write
While Jackals fight over the poison Emperor's body
Priest and Canibus enjoy their memorable armies
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

A lyricist without with no master, and no financer
After the disaster I will die from laughter
Alright, let's move out people
I got a five ton diesel for the illegal Hazmat retreat
Too deep to say peace to
I pray about peace for you
Very soon the Goetia will eat you
The keys of Solomon will open the door to that bottomless prison
And let Leviathan's army in
'Liquid Wordz', spit superb
From the foothills of Zagros to the streets of New Jerz
NewARK, I'm the rear admiral in New York
If I'm caught they'll award the posthumous purple heart
Navy cross never say we lost, damn, Abramoff is in court

Hate U 2,C! True Hollywood Stories,2001,"Yo why you got so much hatred?
Why you don't want me to make it?
What are you afraid of?
You treat me like I'm not a member of the rap game club
Yo I sold a million records too, I don't get the same love
It's strange because the majors already drained my pockets
And now they wanna drain my blood
Do you have any idea of what I did to get here? Do you?!
You can smell the hatred in the atmosphere
This record is livin proof that I've made it
And you're listening to it now, and it's on an independent label
You like Canibus? Yeah right, if you say so
Talk to Louie Lombard, he'll put you on the payroll
When you see me on the street now, I probably really glow
Nothin like some of these wack rappers that are really broke
I can laugh at a meaningless joke, but I got a daughter to feed
Don't hate me cuz I'm competin bro
I'm doin it all by myself
And as long as I'm on the shelf, I'm always have wealth
This is what motivated microphone FIENDS do
And it's ok if you hate me cuz I hate you too

Is the reason why you keep callin my name out of the blue
If it's because you hate me, then I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you hate me, I'll say I hate you too
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!


I hate your style, when I see you I wanna hurl
I should do somethin real foul, like get at your girl
Make your heart throb, take a hooptie and smash your parked car
Run up in your favorite night club, get you barred (Fuck outta here!!)
Why you like to hate stars? Why you talkin in riddles?
Me losin is the only way to get you to giggle
You pitiful motherfucker, you gon' stay in the gutter
I can see you at 33 and still be livin with your mother
I'm sick of you clowns runnin around, hatin on Rippers
You see me in the street, act like your mouth got a zipper
Aiyyo don't say a word faggot cuz it's already proven
Keep it movin, you ain't FUCKIN up this new shit I'm doin
I'm tryin to keep a space between me and you, like gapped teeth
To avoid catchin cases for lettin the gat speak
I ain't never got a problem to meet on a backstreet
In a black hoodie, new mac-milli, now act silly
You can hate me forever, I'ma always be makin moves
Don't be mad cuz I'm a leader, a Ripper that breaks rules
It's a shame what hate's makin individuals do
Don't forget the bottom line is that I hate you too

Is the reason why you keep callin my name out of the blue
If it's because you hate me, then I hate you too
We heard it through the Grapevine and now we know it's true
Just tell me that you hate me, I'll say I hate you too
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out you was hatin on us!",https://genius.com/Canibus-hate-u-2-lyrics
Mind Control,Mind Control,2005,"You're under my, you're under mind control
You know you're lost, don't even try to fight
You can't escape, I rule you day and night
You're under my, you're under mind control

Been in this rap game since '96
Can-I-Bus, also known as Canibus
And even though that might seem like a short time
I was never known for spitting a short-rhyme
I'm known for my ill metaphors and lines
And I'm inspired by that little voice inside
That says, 'keep a strong mind and don't compromise'
Nothing happens before it's time, don't get off of the grind
See the game is cold, don't lose control
All the glitters ain't gold, you could lose your soul
I've been through it before, guess you live and you learn
Everyone takes turns getting what they deserve
It's like a revolving door as far as Canibus is concerned
Please believe it, I'mma get what I earned
As far as getting that dough, and everything else in my career goes
I'm completely in control, come on


Now don't get it twisted, Canibus ain't getting Jiggy with it
I'm just dumbing it down for a minute
Went from Jersey to A-T-L, but then I relocated
Out to Cali on some one-way shit
Bought a cheap ticket and split, I'm in coach sitting next to this chick
With some real voluptuous lips
She asked me if I can help her give her luggage a lift
After that, she wouldn't shut up for the rest of the trip
She said she thought I looked familiar, but she never caught on
I started nodding off, she was talking so long
Put my headphones on, then I went to sleep
Reclined the seat, thought about rhymes and beats
I thought about how I spent so much time in the East
And how my mind was never in peace
In the streets, if you want to that yellow-brick road
Paved with gold, you just gotta take control, come on


I stepped off the plane, never want to sit in coach again
I can't deal with the neck-pain
Seen some guy holding up a sign with my name
What's up my main-man, where's baggage claim'
Took the elevator, I was physically drained
The chick from the plane said, 'bye,' and started to wave
Man, I'm just happy to be in L.A
Got my release papers from Universal/M.C.A
Now it's time to get that real paper, shake off the haters
They can't break us, we're Gladiators
World famous, my name is on the mind of all of the majors
Canibus is outrageous
Fans sing along when I perform on stages
Or when they hear my songs on they two-way pagers
They can't front, cause I broke the mold
And took a little time, but now I'm in control
(Laura Branigan vocalizes the harmony until fade)",https://genius.com/Canibus-mind-control-lyrics
The Goetia,For Whom the Beat Tolls,2007,"Necronomicon
And there is variation in the analogy of where these things have come from
They were created by these giants
They were created by watcher themselves
They can manifest…

‘Nothing to Prove’, ‘Nothing to Lose’
Can-I-Bus busting in the booth
Straight out the Goetia to eat you
This is the fire breather
’Nothing to Prove’, ‘Nothing to Lose’
Can-I-Bus and Mic Club busting in the booth

Microphone check one-two, you know what it is
Can-I-Bus, still getting biz
With mics, gas molecules emit light
I bring delta T.C. squared to the fistfight
First I developed offence
Then negotiate disarmament from the other side of the fence
Hence, the tetrahedron is a prison for a four headed demon
I weaken, every time I see him
Fight for my freedom, under the fig tree bleeding
I create Hip Hop but don't need it
I turn my back on rap like God turned his back on Eden
To return like Cat Stevens
For those who believe it, I live it, I breathe it
I smash mics to pieces, that's the secret
I cannot fail, I rock bells
On the Ho Chi Minh trail to the song of the nightingale
Any artist, can turn a garden into a desert
But can he turn a desert into a garden?
That's where I come in, running, straight gunning
Ready to punish, nigga I don't budge one inch
Fuck it, double the budget
Niggas turned Hip Hop to something it wasn't
Made it hard to love it
So I come back to conquer with a monster mantra
My spiritual father is Swami Vivekananda
Rhymes promote freedom, stabilize the region
Think for yourselves, it's just like breathing
The departed Hip Hop artist regarding the condition of the carnage
Dead farmers I already saw it
Back to the army, back to Pathari, Tari
Back to the heartbeat, offbeat on a dark street
Comfy aggressive assistive training
Hajji somewhere waiting, one minute remaining
Satellites counter locating, the bloodbath begins bathing
We both believe we're fighting Satan
But we both got the same god, who accepts the same sacrifice
Blood, tears, life
Fine picks and trowels are real I was holding a weapon
When I was overpowered, there was no album
Thirty minute sessions cleaning weapons, asking myself questions
About what happened last mission
Radiation isolation, I'm an asshole but I'm patient for a nurse with nice shaped tits
I'm a poet, my house is a palace
A small cavernous passage darker than the Catacombs of Paris
Chateau de Canibus, Saint Germaine sadomasochist
I don't use chains to trap a bitch
Don't get distracted, repeat your rap schematic
Over and over until it's automatic
My body is a machine, machines need fuel
Two gastro-nasal tubes feed me smoothie food
The recluse clearly produced
The abstract schematic you can use over a freshly squeezed glass of pear juice
Right side paralyzed above the waist
Below the waist the left side paralyzed, this a unique case
It's a challenge to rhyme great, lost weight
Lost sense of smell and taste, wasting away paying attention to space
Saying ""wait!"" open the gate, rusty screwers reverberate
Through the deserted desolate space of this purgative place
Grimoires of metaphor law make your skin crawl
’Nothing to Prove’, this is lyrical law",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-goetia-lyrics
My Name is Nobody,My Name is Nobody,UnKnown,"Yo, this rap game is a lot like high school, a high school is a lot like life

Nobody

My name is nobody, my name is nobody
What's my name? Say my name!
What's my name?

Yo, 
I never rocked with Nas,
 I never rocked with Rakim Allah
I never gave y'all a hundred bars
I never walked among the stars, I never rocked a mic on tour
Never made some groupie bitch drop her drawers
Never had a menage-a-trois, with girls lickin' my balls while I eat em'
Nah, I never done that neither
And I never wore that white wife beater
On the video set with the Lost Boyz and Dogg Pound and smoked reefer
I never had a Source quotable
I never rocked 50 bar vocals on ""Beasts from the East"" with Reggie Noble
Never spit with Keith Murray or Little Jamal
I never rocked on stage at the Apollo at all
To this day, if someone asked me ""why were you silver on MTV?""
I have to just tell them it wasn't me
Cause I'm nobody

My name is nobody, my name is nobody

Yo, I never been at the Mardi Gras, suckin' on ta-tas
I never been to LA, or Krissed to Ya Ya's
I never been overseas
I never been to Amsterdam walkin' right past the cops smokin' some trees
I never had a battle with about a dozen emcees
And simultaneously I brought 'em all to they knees
I never been off the scene too long
Never been totally gone, never appeared on a shitload of songs
I never rocked with Eminem yet, yeah that's true
People'll talk about it from now to the day that I do
But I never made an impact
I never changed rap; in fact, sometimes I wish I could take it all back
I didn't sell enough units
I said I was the illest alive, and I didn't prove it, I probably look stupid
I guess I'm nobody, I guess I'm nobody
I'm so so sorry, my name is nobody

My name is nobody, my name is nobody
My name is nobody, my name is nobody
My name is nobody, my name is nobody
My name is nobody, my name is nobody
My name is nobody, my name is nobody (Nigga, I ain't nobody to know)
My name is nobody, my name is nobody (Get it?)
What's my name? Say my name!
What's my name?

Yo, yo
It's like the rap community doesn't know what to do with me
What if there was two of me?
What if I persuaded some bitches to reproduce with me
And create a whole crew of me?
Only those that are as cruel as me, can rule with me
I got a secret let's keep it between you and me

You can say this at my eulogy
You can say this at my motherfucking eulogy",https://genius.com/Canibus-my-name-is-nobody-lyrics
Gold & Bronze Magik,Melatonin Magik,2010,"They can't do shit with me like a custom model Tyson
A herd of wild bison trying to get that cake without the icing
Can't stop the poison, empty glass in intestine
I'm destined to rest in the Sun, weed in the Westin
Pulitzer Prize priceless verses is in the resting
As a new bible, witness tribal wars for block titles
Vital organs stop, subtle
Fiends like they're lions, when they get around the rock and huddle
Undertake, bodies ungulate, under earthly underlays
Unachieved summaries, no open warranties
Cause my flow is never broken like a pregnancy
When I speak they'd rather see polluted clouds rain Hennessy
Take you with no receipt like dope traffic currency
Uninsured surgery when under my knife
Some paid with a briefcase, some paid with their life
My home sticks is Baghdad under U.S. plane strikes
It's a useless vein tap with an empty syringe
Injecting wind into the blood flow, sip ether and grim
Smoke secrets from burning circles, sour diesel and singe
The cloak, the grim reaper, creeping, sneaking, you in

Round and round, the burning circle
All the seasons: one, two, and three
Round and round, the burning circle
All the seasons: one, two, and three

C-write, give it a little umph!
Yeah, O dot Megahertz, you already know what it is
Axe, inseminate the place, 614
Yeah, you know what they say?

Behind my back they say he's very arrogant, but they air they're inhaling in isn't there to sniff
Dare to whiff and I'm tearing the air to get from where it is
There's a chicken hailing and I'm tearing it through her pair of tits
There's a kid, my fist is impaling him through his pair of ribs
From a kamikaze, crazy bomber, drama like Shady's mama
Fucking with bitches ugly as Biggie's baby's mama
And I stay, mismatched to the socks
Bitch laughed, said my name's dispatched to the cops
Stitched patch on my crotch reads, ""Kiss me, I'm Irish""
My click be the flyest, don't, excuse me, I'm biased
But try us and lose the cocky smile, who could stop me now?
When I'm right on the money like the Illuminati owl
If I'm off, a DJ mixed my acapella wrong
Mozzarella's long enough to buy the rights to every Rocafella song
I'm lying, but not when I'm rhyming, my stock is hella long
Too hot to mail a song, the mailman said he thought I mailed a bomb
Rain, sleet, snow or hail, I'm smoking well
Granted you'd think I was Spanish how well I rolled an L
To where they meet it, or see the chocha, I'm living la vida loca
I'm Peter the chiba smoker, no reason to cease the dolja
Breathing a leaf, Jesus, I've seen crows from beneath the roses
That sweet aroma could wake Pete old cold from deepest coma
But know the skills' on over kill until I reach the reaper's quota
Put him out of business then hire him for cheap to clean the sofa
Ends with the bones of Barbosa, flow's well written
No help given, I'm self-driven like a chauffeur
Still spitting that crazy shit, you don't like it?
You could suck a fat baby's dick while it's dad babysits

You are the reflection of an illusion, you do not exist
What you feel is real, everything else is a script
That they wrote for me, I hallucinate creepy crawlies
Rhyming is a hobby, you can’t even talk to me
DJ's, radio stations, millions of listeners are prisoners
Their salvation is not your business
Canibus spit when Canibus wanna spit shit
Got that? Don’t let me have to tell you again
The Western world is spiritually sterile, in great peril
We in the concrete jungle where they spank apes with the metal
I rhyme for the betterment of the culture
I don’t spit no hot sixteens for promotion
Or corporate vultures who act like they own us
Self-expression is our birthright, not a bonus
Hip Hop can govern come together and show the whole world something

If everything is in good order, I spit some more
The moral of the story is this
Don’t get pissed because your upbringing was strict ‘cause life is a gift
You got food to eat, you got teeth to eat it with
Shoes on your feet, don’t be conceited, be content
Even when you lose, think about what you did to win
If you did the best that you can, you did a good thing
But you shouldn’t smoke weed if you swim
Don’t buy assault rifles, don’t fight dogs, don’t hit your girlfriend
Don’t mix cocaine with unprescribed medicine
And don’t say you’re sober if you plan to do it again
With that said sleep tight tonight when you go to bed
This is Public Service Announcement 2010

Tim Westwood Freestyle,UnKnown,2016,"Yo, yo, yo
I look directly into human eyes to see if you pussy
And completely ruin your ability to lie to me
Now you can stand in front of me lookin' real silly
Or prepare to go to battle, and kick a rhyme to me
I pull a nine on a bully, cock back the cannon
God damn it, I don't think you fully understand it
Ask nine out of ten people on the planet
Who the best is, the question will go unanswered
'Till I step up, to the front line with rhymes
Revin' my engines like they was powered by Le Mans
Murderin' niggas with lyrics manufactured within my DNA's
Double-helix, I'll leave you in troubled spirits
I'm absolutely the purest, from the USA
To Europe, because I deserve it
Let me pass it to my man Wyclef
W-Y-C-L-E-F, yo, there's no contest

Yo, the W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
There's no contest, about to put 'em to rest
The primary purpose to this text is to present
Techniques, and guided 'um a practice
To cause boxers to um, forfeit
MC's who's focused, Wyclef too accomplished
AAH, I'm throwin' clones in the Hell pit
Vocabulary comprehension study
Readin' in critical analyzin'
Techniques to enable DJs
To interact with my material
Westwood, play it on your turntable
Scratch it if your able
Characteristics, circumstances
Will determine how long you live
Mr.  Actress
I aqua-snatch gats from kids with pack back
Who lack raps, and rap to get quick dap

Yo, yo, yo
My lyrical inertia rips holes through the fabric of universes
With rhymes three times the density of what the Earth is
I carry lyrics for niggas who carry burners
You against me is like a lighter against a furnace
Knockin' niggas out, and knockin' niggas off
For comin' around the way with them lugs that look like clocks
Check the astrophysics of these lyrical lyrics
Comin' to digits too big for niggas to count on they fingers
Check the hype shit, blow up a mic shit, you might get
Beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick
Mentally advanced, ever since the brain transplant
Canibus recieved the Fugee's jacket from 

Yo, yo, now check it out
1, 2 for your brain, here we go, yo, yo
One take, I make the Earth quake
Let the hater's debate, I walk away with the sweepstake
I won the lotto, check out the lingo
Me, and my micro, more chips then bingo
You still S-O-S-O, your crew got no ammo
I'm not a communist, but I get guns from Castro
Whether in trio, a rockin' solo
Give up my chain 'cause you thought I was dolo
Uh oh, uh oh, yo he about to be zero
Send him back to real underground like 
Play that kid out like Michael's brother Tito
Then lay low, in London with the ladies speakin' 'Spanol
So  banner who  on my scanner
My grammar slammer any crew who choose to do

See, physically
I move at a velocity, that'll break your stopwatch if your clockin' me
My concrete jungle is like Jumanji
But iller than what you seen in the cinema
A five-foot-eight nigga with more horsepower than twelve cylinders
My brain consists of twin Pentium chips
That's double the clock speeds of a five-eighty-six
Nothin' about my physical matrix is basic
I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tasting
You'll be so surprised, you won't believe your own eyes
It's like a Jamaican seeing the snow for the first time
Rhymes of a sort to distort space, and time
It's like, explaining color to a man who was born blind
One of a kind, I got divine chromosomes in me
My sperm will scramble the eggs in a woman's ovaries
'Cause I'm as original as it gets
And I can't respect cats that copy like double-Dex
I get vexed when crab niggas bite my style
'Cause I'm sellin' a thousand records per day, per square mile
Breakin' the laws of physics with metaphors, and lyrics
Speaking to dead poets by conjuring up they spirits
From Shakespear to Edgar Allen
Yo, the whole Dead Poet Society couldn't mess around with the talent
Much less understand it, I make tightrope walkers at the circus lose they balance when I kick the planet

Yo, yo, yo
Pick up the pencil, raps must be crucial
Thoughts go blank, yo, 'cause you couldn't bank
The eight-ball back to the corner, back to the corner
Pocket, mock it, jock it, but like Jimi Hendrix you couldn't hear it
No hard feelin', villain, this ain't your everyday rapper
The name Wyclef, I'm about to get dapper
When I whistle, uh, two dogs by my side
Plus a black pistol, uh, loud MC's SH!
Feel the silence, so you still talkin', you cuckoo
I send psycho's to  you, AAAAH!
I'll have you scream too
Real live cinema, the streets produce the junkies
Pull back on your shirt, you're lookin' like E.T
You're cracked out, fo' do', some blow on saxophone
We rhymin' off-beat, even with help from your metronome
You not an MC, see you a CM
Common Motherfucka rhymin' 'bout lexuses, and benz
Same benz you got jacked in (Yo, change the beat nigga!)
Change the beat, change the beat, change the track
(Yeah, change it to, ""We no soldiers, we don't die, there's no lie in the NA-NA-NA!)


The secret of the ages, I illuminate with logic
What I speak, it's more than just deep, it's bottomless
With common sense, I'm organized like crimes in mafias
Plus the way I rhyme is Prime like Optimus
A rapologist, you could sit, and do the knowledge with
GEDs to degrees from Ivy League colleges
I politic with any magazine colonist
About topics other MCs won't even bother with
Rock solid shit like stones, and monuments
It's obvious the third eye, and the obelisk is watchin' us
Closely, through a microscope, and a pair of binoculars
Ghetto scholars like me who study street calculus
I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
To touch a part of your body, then let you feel erogenous

Yo, you wanna battle Wyclef, here's the dream
Hold my hands, and pray, at the 
You don't got knowledge yourself, so you don't know what that means
Keep your lights, keep your  Westwood, give me the action
The battlezone, where I roam in composition
Hardcore in London, with  if I break like
Your first time in jail where you got fucked by an inmate
It'll never happen, I'm more balanced like a Libra
And if I get murdered, don't cry for me, Argentina
Pour me a cup of vodka, bury me next to my father
Three days I rise like Christ, and still sober
Now my eyes open, in my hands I got the gatling
I'm looking for the guy that sent me to say hi to Satan
Fists of fury, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
I turn Mr. Roger's Neighborhood topsy-turvy
Frozen enemies  in the dictionary
This ain't pictionary, all you see is the cemetary
Bodies from WWI, and II was there
You don't want a third war, there's nuclear warfare
Canibus count the stash, making fast, illegal money
Turns legal, you're running a laundry-mat
You're hunchbacked, and wack raps you pack in your backpack
You're better off in DC with the mayor smoking crack
This ain't a diss, ha, Wyclef bomb threat
Run out of the building or get blast in your 
Tec for tec, or we can go text for texture
Oh, I forgot, you don't read, BLAOW, take this hole in your chest
Hide the gun yo, it's a homicide
When the DT shows up, they thought it was a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Canibus grab the mic, and represent with your third eye

I drink a gallon of the ginseng extract
Harness all my lyrical power to rip tracks
I shed light upon pitch black, so at times
Even your third eye finds my rhymes too bright to glimpse at
I think back to before I was born
When suckas wasn't even involved in this art form
Now they write rhymes to reflect nothing but hard times
While I be on America online
Electronically mailing my thoughts across the information highway
Trying to communicate wit' y'all way
Discovering shit, to make a nigga bug
I speak a language that don't even require the tongue
Raps carry the impact, of a sawed-off
Get in my face, and your liable to get yours blown off
I'ma show off, everyone up North knows I'm the best
LL couldn't bring it to me if he had my home address
Much less defeat me, you must be taking steroids
And not eating your wheaties, and smoking crack instead of beadies
Step into the ring, I put you through pain you've never been through
Torture will force you to tap out so I don't have to pin you
You see my style will get in you like an injection
Lyrical ooze causin' rap crews to become X-Men
Infecting MCs with a disease there's no cure for
No man can withstand a Canibus metaphor
I freak a rhyme 'til your sampler stops counting bars
And delegate laws as if I'm God
So call me arrogant if you want to
But the Canibus creates cyphers niggas can bring a lighter, and a blunt to
Uncle Sam wants you, but he don't want me
Because lyrically I'm too advanced for you average MCs
My field of forces, bigger than twenty golf courses
Eerie like government theories behind flying saucers
I go on, and on, and on for hours until batteries die
Then I switch to auxiliary power
It's no soldiers, there's no lie
We don't die in the NA-NA-NA",https://genius.com/Canibus-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics
Atlanta,My Name is Nobody,UnKnown,"I wake up in the morn', turn my PlayStation on
Just bought that NFL Blitz and that Basket-Ball
I read the Vibe and Source, to see what's going on
I let my hair grow long, maybe braid it in the fall
Whenever I get bored, I just jump in my car
I go to Lennox Mall, and look for independent broads
Sometimes I get a nod, they treat me like a scrub
I go down to the schools, maybe I get more love
Three P.M. in the evening, I'm on the highway speeding
My front-left tires leaking, should have bought a new one last weekend
I guess I wasn't thinking, up ahead break-lights was blinking
For more than thirty minutes I was stuck in gridlock prison
This traffic drives me crazy, going West on two-eighty
Five bitch almost made me, crash into her Mercedes
I'm glad I almost missed her, I pushed the clutch and shifted
It was a white lady, I'd rather hit a sister
Cause see, I know the system, it's easier to trick them
I use my G to pimp them, then convince I'm the victim
Nah baby, you hit me, no I was in lane three
You need some contacts you can't see, no girl don't blame me
Don't panic just be patient, give the bitch the wrong information
She'll probably never claim it, scared of high insurance payments
I love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta
I love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta

The land of pretty peaches, them girls with round features
Make a nigga say, ""Good Jesus,"" them Georgia dime-pieces
Started off like, ""What's your name? Tell me, what's your age?
You got a man? Can we be friends?""
I'm glad you feel that way, come on and ride with me
I take you to that Crunk bar where them sharks eat
Five-star baby, bon-appetite
I got that shrimp appetizer with that dog meat
If shorty want to creep, I bring her home with me
Just bought some candles and that Carl Thomas CD
Bootleg that Jay-Z, stole that OutKast
Been have that Keith Sweat, I know how to make it last
Smack that naked ass, she got a big butt
I ain't in no rush, plus she likes it rough
Kinky stuff like, leather and handcuffs
And them thangs you wrap around a man's you-know-what
That's why I love Atlanta, I can hardly stand-up
I'm a heavy drinker, fix me a cup and sinker
I always love Atlanta, that's why I love Atlanta
I love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta

As a young child I was so damn bad
Used to drive up the Ave with no tags
Niggas couldn't see me, I was going so fast
Most niggas catch whiplash and crash
Face all chipped up from the glass
Running from the police hauling ass
If I get caught, I just give them some cash
Most police give me dap and laugh
Other ones pull up behind the flash
Take a nightstick and tap the glass
Tell me, ""Turn the music down,"" it's on blast
Turn the engine off cause I'm wasting gas
Tell them that I'm lost and I need a map
Looking for a hotel to take a nap
Freaknik, officer, I came for that
It was good last year that's why I'm back
That's when he tried to hit me
His big fist barely miss me
I have my camera with me
I think I'll sue the city
I love this place Atlanta
That's why I love Atlanta
I love my home Atlanta
I love my home Atlanta",https://genius.com/Canibus-atlanta-lyrics

This is the reason why
Very soon when the sky became dark

And only a few them will stay alive""

Code-Name: Javelin Fangz - The Canibus Man
Nothin' to Prove, cold bustin' at you dudes
Yea, yo

You got the filthy slut pin-up calendar?: Yes

Can-I-Bus is the MC not weed
Hand radio?: Check. Map?: Check
You got the chem lights so we can get back?: Check
First aid kit?: Check. Grenades?: Check
I even got a spit box for those lonely days

I was on my way home, the ground opened up like a grave
Turned the highway into a tomb
It's crazy I grew up playin' with Tonka's
Mickey Thompson mud Swampers on a off-road monster
I took a detour, started headin' east
Got stuck through a wench around a red wood tree
A thousand feet above sea level
Still drivin' altitude climbin' the Tsunami's 1 hour behind me
Made my way to the Mojave, I robbed niggas for they gasoline
Then headin' towards the Colorado Rockies
Desperado, El Diablo on your back yard property
Can't let the circumstance stop me
G.I. Joe, O.G., Desert E's, Desert fatigues
Dry weather gear for the desert breeze
140° degrees, I can barely breathe
Toast bread and fry eggs on the roof of my Jeep
Take my boots off I won't even look at my feet
They smell like I've been cookin' my feet
Look at me, I'ma mess I did it for my family & friends
When the time comes I do it again
Because this ain't the end, this is the beginnin'
A new way of life nigga how you gon' live it
Man Women and Child, livin' in a village
No more technology privilege
When disaster strikes put down the mic
You better pick up that weapon and pass it to the right
Laugh if you like but the time is near
There's no time to spare, formation over here

I even got a spit box for those lonely days

I observe purgatory from the solar observatory
The Sun Stone was right, God have mercy on me
You ask what, I ask what next
Geo-magnetic effects came down to the deck
Radio, T.V. Satellite gone, nobody can make or take one call
Lights out! All communications wiped-out
To late to call upon Jesus Christ now
Collect your weapon and ammo
You don't have weapons to protect your family? You an asshole
Guns are worth more then anythin' at a time like this
The price just went up the priceless
You a predator or prey in the twilight mist?
You want to pray, get on your knees, die like a bitch
Your family got dragged off
Put to work as slaves in a Hell pit because you were selfish
You bought cars, gold, diamonds
Should've bought somethin' that could equalize the violence
Face it, your heart's full of hatred
'Cause you got stripped naked in front of your babies, do somethin' to change it
Take it, take a day-off, take a trip to the shop
Get a laser sight scope, adjustable butt stock
Automatic burst, fuck a one shot
If a nigga want static, I'ma give 'em what I got

Canibus Man,Mind Control,2005,"Yo, yo, let me explain something so that you understand
You will never be iller than the Canibus man
You could be male, female, black, white
Fuck the details, I rip a nigga with a rhyme till he screams help
Any nigga I told to kneel knelt
You haven't the slighest idea what a real MC is about
You need to be yourself, you can't sound like nobody else
And you can't do all of the beats yourself
You can't do it without the streets help
Niggas on the block that blast the boom box till the speakers melt
That's how I was brought up, big fat elephant balls what
I'm a knucklehead with big walnuts, small frame extra large guts
I'll do anything to a nigga if he pushes me hard enough
I use to rhyme like all day
I mean little nigga spittin till my jaws felt sore with pain
I use to train with myself in the mirror
Like ""Mirror mirror on the wall, tell me who's iller""
How you like that? I use to say it just like that
Maybe I should copyright that, I'll be right back
(Pause)
Sorry to leave you hangin
I write things down quick cuz I ain't takin no chances
Thats the difference between you and me
You a wanna-be, and I'm an MC
I'm just in the booth right now
I'm just kickin it with you right now
I'm tellin you the truth right now
You can't fuck with the Canibus man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man

Now in this rap field, I got a lot of confirmed kills
I put niggas through drills to prove if they got true skills
You coulda sold millions, but if you ain't got 100 bars shut the fuck up
At least don't talk to me, cuz I ain't hearin you
If you that ill, give me a hundred bars, I'm darin you
I definitely ain't scared of you
I go to war cuz I'm prepared to lose
Just as long as I get to damage you
Take the mic from you, then put a knife in you
That's what I like to do, make you lose a pint or two
If you a lion I'm a tiger too
I could be as nice as you, but if you a snake I'm a viper too
Look you in the eyes and lie to you
Thinkin about all the possible ways to kill you while I smile at you
You like to get fly nigga I'm a pilot too
Don't even try to get deep cuz I'm a diver too
Don't try to fit in my shoes cuz you can't
Nobody can fuck with the Canibus man, understand?

Yo, yo, yo, my mouth is mechanically mechanized
My verbal weapon fires a whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round
Can-I-Bus will buss ya, apply enough pressure to crush ya, I pulverize mother fuckers
Leave MC's laid out like hurricane debris, 15 Megatons of TNT
The overseas block busta, bustin up blocks like the Tiguska meteorite to hit Russia
Comin from the underground I discovered
A ground underneath the ground before underground bunkers
Dedicate it's blunkers, deeper than the labrith
Conductin excavations of the matrix
Living in uninhabitable places, craters of a desert like oasis with a cydonian faces
As barren as Las Vegas, as barren as the wombs of women who use artificial insemination
As barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin, as barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation
A five-star chef makin mouth-watering creations with blood stains on my apron
Put the heads of wack MC's in my oven and bake them
Then garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them
It's not really that odd, when you consider part of the ancient culture loves to eat dogs
Feline cats with their claws, paws and all
Caucasians eat frogs, African-americans eat the hog
Hindus in India will kneel to the floor and worship cows and rats as gods
I raise the odds, spit rhymes towards Mars and beyond to the nearest binary star
I'mma tell you once more my main man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man",https://genius.com/Canibus-canibus-man-lyrics
I Gotta Story 2 Tell,C! True Hollywood Stories,2001,"{Girl Singing}
Listen to me everybody, I got a story to tell
Well, well
Ono wan make beef outta steam fish?
Tell ya artist keep my name out they mouth or you won't have no peace
Compared to Canibus, you pitbulls is poultry
You and Biggie made a dope team but I roast Beans
Be careful how you approach things
My name ain't J to the Muahh, man, I got a flow that stings
It's rap music, you confuse it if you want to
I might still diss you just to see what you gon' do
You must be gettin' insecure or something
I'm just admirin' your shit, man, I ain't gon' touch it
I been through a lot of things in my life but I learned from it
Put yourself in my shoes, don't I deserve something?
The only difference between me and you is a budget
Don't make me have to go and sign with Suge or something
Remember this: history repeats itself
Whenever that never-ending hunger meets itself
Everybody want they wealth, peace and health
When I was fucked up you ain't give me a couple of G's to help, did you?
No, you waited for my cheese to melt
You want all the hot beats and the streets to yourself
Well my patronymic is different enough to attract interest
From anybody in the rap business and I'mma get it, cash or credit
Besides a little drama with my first 2 records
Rip the Jacker's image is unblemished
Come on, I wouldn't bite you I look at you like my dentist
I thought you was number one recommended, why you offended?
Hip hop ain't your property, you ain't the only tenant
If I win the lottery, you can't tell me how to spend it
You got something to say, don't put your Henchmen in it
Them little monkey-faced artist that you sign for pennies
I refuse to serve them like Denny's
You know they rhymes is petty
Don't tell me that your school of hard knocks turn preppy
None of y'all motherfuckers know me and you never met me
And if my name wasn't shit, then, you wouldn't sweat me
That's absurd right? Me gettin' busy get on your nerves, right?
You really are listenin' to the words, right?
High when I wrote this but sober when I spoke it
It's not like I tried to promote it like Jay-O did, you notice?
Man, I was never focused on you
I just spit hard on the mic 'cause my shit is hot too
I went out and bought your album 2 times, I ain't hatin'
Next thing I know, you talkin' Jamaican, like, you a native
But you really violatin', you don't know what you sayin'
Canibus ain't in the game, so you know he ain't playin
I had nothing before and I have nothing now
Fuckin' with a nigga with nothing only brings you down

Stomp On Ya Brain,Melatonin Magik,2010,"""If you can't walk the walk,"" nah don't even try it
When I'm wired, I spit fire
And come stomp on your brain, brain, brain...

Yo! What about hip-hop, is so interesting?
Emcees battle for respect, it's intensive
Spit rhymes while I shimmy up the cliff side
Before you ask why I'm trying to show you where Rip died
The questions give me more insight into your mind
Than those whack rhymes I hear you reciting all the time
Restore and re-establish it, revive it, revamp it
Refresh yourself with something organic, and mechanic
Verses be so strong they are generally interpreted wrong
Prompting corresponding responses from the songs
Mr. Motherfucking Know-It-All, bet you ten gold granola bars
I'm smarter than those fifth graders are
The writing technique is from a lion-headed beast
Sciatic nerve got me spitting automatic words
Ideas eliminated in the order they were created
Amid speculative language about how I even made it
Rebel without a cause, spitting ten billion bars
To the cold corpse cellophane wrapped on the floor
There's more, I declare war, bomb 'em
Pound after pound I come stomp on 'em


We bite without barkin', you just a target
I shot darts and stomp on your brain in Doc Martins
With boats shoes, so crude, my pardon
Soon as the clock startin', show moves I got from old dudes
Who used to smoke Kools by the carton
Set fire to you, I'm the arson
Was clappin' at cats, before they applauded for John Carson
Anybody with good sense, know the footprints
I'mma leave is from the Air Max 93s
'til everything you see is Siamese
I've been stomping since chicks from Martin was buying reeds
We stomp on your cane, and sell it to niggas
The niggas stomp on your brain
Who wanna tangle with the black orangutan?
I came to bang, it ain't a thang
Name a name he'll be history
Nothing more than a mystery, a Stephen King novel
Either they ain't been watching or they need a clean goggle
To follow the footsteps of the T Rex, detect
Whoever leap next from a speed jet without a parachute
Turn you into carrot soup troop


The duck-billed dino was eaten by the eighty ton rhino
A very long time ago
Soul, rock and roll, RTJ double-oh
Now you know nigga, lock and load
How can I create the right sentence to help explain
How it feels when a whack emcee rhymes for Germaine?
Don't be a water brain, make you spit your rhymes in quarantine
Put you up against War Machine
Sixty second rounds, keep your metaphors clean
Sleepwalk when I dream, spit Listerine green
The Microphone Fiend on the scene
Call on them scream, he might break you off a sixteen
Laser beam lyrics coming at you at an altered speed
The Altered Beast don't pause for the beat
This is lyrical law, you will be among the first to compete
To run, walk, or crawl over beats
The goal is too tall to reach, can't touch the Spit Boss' feet
You pole vault into a wall of defeat
I love Biggie cause I know what he means
When he told you, ""It was all a dream""",https://genius.com/Canibus-stomp-on-ya-brain-lyrics
A Different Vibe in L.A.,C! True Hollywood Stories,2001,"Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A

Yeah, cruisin down Melrose, hella slow in a yellow Marinello
Lookin for who sells shelltoes that I could match with my silk robe
I'm like Hugh Hefner at 26 years old, with clear goals
Yeah I'll take two pair of those
I love the way my toes feel in the cyberfoam soles when I'm doin' shows
Who knows, I'm prepared to go to and fro
All I do is tell you dudes where the Western Union dough
You need my social security info?
Here's my tax I.D. number, it's worth ten fold
I remember my first album, it shipped gold
That's an insult, considering I did this one in Kinko's
I'm dying to see what this will sold
Will the critics diss it at all, or will they feed Bis to the wolves?
Like I haven't been there before
But at least I'm on a different vibe now, this year it's on


It's definitely a different vibe west of the Prime Meridian
Producers play with live instruments, rhymes are wittier
But don't sleep cuz in a heartbeat Cali'll shit on ya
Someone'll put a hit on ya, this'll be where they bury ya
I think it's beautiful, I don't want to be scarin' ya
The women are prettier and the climate is superior
Got a girl from Syria, smells like strawberries on her period
I'm serious - that's why I moved in with the chick
We on the top of Mount Olympus, sharin' our interests
Over a moonlit dinner, burnin' some incense
She looks so innocent, next think I know she's pinnin' me to the bed
Like a scene outta Basic Instinct
Bought her a pink mink and a double link ring
She didn't know I was a rapper and I did my thing-thing
What a coincidence, she listened to Eminem and NSYNC
Shaggy, Nelly, and the St. Lunatic clique, Uh-Ohhhh!


Yeah baby, Canibus in the flesh
Everybody want a dose of me, come here baby stand close to me
Take a photo with me, take this address
If you develop 'em post one to me
If you miss me and you wanna kiss me then blow one to me
I like your eccentricities, tailor-fitting jeans
Tennis bracelets from Tiffany's in Venice, Italy
Are you from the Middle East? (Oh)
I plan to travel there after my new release
I got Timbaland doin' some beats
Yeah, his cousin goes to school with my niece
By the way I'm sorta starved, what kinda food do you eat?
Yeah sure hop in the car, we'll cruise the streets
Around here I know alotta cool places to eat
You off from what, noon to three? Just roll with me
My homie Lou just two-wayed me from Laguna Beach
You can meet the rest of the crew, a bunch of super freaks
We got to unwind, we 'bout to hit the road in two weeks, c'mon

Can-I-Bus 'bout to blow up the spot
103 Jams, yeah, chillin' with my man
With the Sean John shirt on
Uh, swift hands cut the record up
'Bout to bust it up, yeah
Yo

I radiate like plutonium rods that glow
Geiger-counters drum roll when I start to flow
Patriarch with the heart of Napoleon Bonaparte
Stomp across continents to conquer my art
I'm a millennium lyricist, area-51 physicist
Rhymes hot enough to melt the wax
Off the turntable before the DJ even starts spinning it
My raps could melt the wax right off the back of Kid Icarus
Sharper than the shit you shank niggas with, sharper
Than scissor tips, sharper than rings on Rza's fist
It's ridiculous how so many of you niggas figure that
Maybe we can get a name if Canibus disses us
I know how you niggas think, 
you figure since
You already a pussy you might as well give me syphilis
Envious ‘cause your rhymes are infinite and you're lyrically
 Limited to the little boxes you're living in
I'm as dangerous as they come, dangerous with or
Without a gun, I've been dangerous from day one
Rhyme flows explode like pyros
Stick to your ribs like chicken and thick gravy from Roscoe's
You get your head flown if you dumb in the dome
Or struck with some stones ‘till you feel numb in the bones
You better keep your big mouth closed  - before I
Stick the muzzle of my chrome in that hole under your nose
Send a signal to my index and tell it to fold
In the direction of my wrist bones to release your soul
I told you to freeze, if I was you I would have froze
But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes
Pistol to your mug, cripple your tongue, rip through your lungs
Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood
Come on, give me a little love - there anybody out there
That never felt one rhyme that Canibus bus'ed?
You a liar, liar, pants on fire - watch the Goat
With the ghostwriter get slaughtered by a tiger
Saw his video, uh, yeah
Smeared his career like doo-doo inside a diaper
My style is sicker than infected women and men
I'm so raw I could catch AIDS without sticking it in
Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi
Switch my language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
To a level you could never explain
‘Cause compared to me your brain is the size of a sand grain
A real pain in the ass that got smacked for saying my name
And now you look like a ass in pain
Guess what? Got ‘F'-ed up ‘cause you shouldn't have stood up
Sweeter than a handful of granulated sugar
Niggas running they mouth like I can't get to them
But watch the shit hit the fan when that cat Can pull up
No question, get wrecked in less than a nanosecond
For messing with me or my brethren
You can't stop aggression, you can't hold back what's destined
And you definitely can't coach perfection
Be the only nigga standing after Armageddon
Take a hammer and smash the stone your name was etched in
Then I'll announce that I'm running for the new election
Anybody with an objection gets the death-sentence
Death by lethal-injection, death by being beheaded
Death by getting shot with a weapon, but if you
Want to be remembered then death by getting
Your head severed is an honorable way to end it

103 Jams
It's the Canibus Man
Blackin' out for ya'll
Yeah, one time
This is how we do
On the M-I-C when we MC brain cell never M.D
Yo
If I said it once, I say it a thousand times
I've got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind
You want a piece of mine? Fine, we can take it outside
Otherwise your wasting your time
‘Cause I'm gonna shine past the one-triple-nine
Niggas gamble and damage their eyes
Going blind trying to keep up with these lyrical lines
Type of nigga you can't flow behind without a dope rhyme
Mess around and get clothes-lined ‘till you nose-dive
We can rhyme fair-and-square or fair in a sphere
Anyplace, anywhere ya'll niggas ain't got a prayer
‘Cause Doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared
They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air
With a long-white beard flaming
Hot enough to sunburn Satan
Hotter than white people taking vacation
Out in Virginia, out in the sun baking
Sun baking in gamma-ray radiation ‘till they skin color look Cajun
Mother-fuckers start aging ‘till the point where they faces shrivel up like raisins
And they become cancer patients
This is how we do it when we chilling in the V-A
Can-I-Bus getting busy on the P-A
System, yeah, I get in ‘em
With a lyrical algorithm liable to kill ‘em
My style will get in ‘em, way up in ‘em
Face don't belong on the Source, it should be on the Shroud of Turin for certain
Grab mics and murder shit
As wicked as Satan worshippers going to Catholic Church services
You heard of this new lyrical verbalist
Yo, yo, yo
I kick a verse at six hundred and sixty-six megahertz
Make lightening flash across the sky every time I curse
Six hundred and sixty-six flashes
Give out six hundred and sixty-six lashes
To the backs of six hundred and sixty-six Masters of Ceremony has-beens
Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is
If he's a Catholic I'll nail him to a crucifix
Then I'll beat him ‘till he's blackish-blueish
Then perform acupuncture with six hundred and sixty-six toothpicks
Beat him with two whips with pieces of broken glass glued to it
Your whole crew get spayed and neutered
As soon as I aim and shoot it you get slayed with bullets
Your armored cars and your Kevlar vests is useless
I'm going to hit all of you pussies like group sex //",https://genius.com/Canibus-103-jamz-freestyle-lyrics
Gybaotc,My Name is Nobody,UnKnown,"Yo, I done been from Jersey to Brooklyn
Done been through Queens where the crooks hang
Done been on tour doing group thangs
Cause I'm always tasting that 
pootang
Really love it when a girl got a cute name
Got a cute attitude and a cute frame
Got a big ass butt, breasts and no brain
Them things make a nigga want to shoot game
Now check it, I done been through a few thangs
Done seen a lot more than some loose change
Always been open minded to new thangs
Looking for a rap nigga, I'ma true thang
Been a Hip-Hop nigga since youth man
Beat-box and break-dance too man
Used to do electric boogaloos man
Do Egyptian love with two hands
I remember when I lived down south, yo
In a hot ass one story house, yo
Where the A.C. was always going out, yo
Sometime spend a whole day outdoors
We had a block-party, barbeque, eating food, in the pool
Music got us in that mood, everybody act a fool
I'mma tell you like this man
Every night I go down to the city man
To the gentlemen's club where my niggas hang
Them stripper chicks know how to strip man
DJs be spinning them hits man
Play the Cash-Money clique and the Jigga man
Them hoes be thick but sick man
Every stripper think a motherfucking rich man
Like Sisqo, the R&B singing man
Think I got a bank account with a million man
Case of Crystal cost about six grand
Bitch better get a less expensive brand
Got to stick to the budget when I trick, man
How about ten dollars for a sip, man?
My whole dance for a ten dollar tip, man
Still waiting on my royalty check, man
How about a rain-check next time, yo?
How about a handful of coupons, yo?
How about tickets to my next five shows
Turn around, let me test that behind, yo, I love a fine ho

Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club

Nigga please! What you think this is
We ain’t just strippers, we actresses
I been tryin' to get into this acting bizz
But in the meantime I need cash to live
Shake this big butt, pay them dues
I gotta buy books cause I’m goin to school
Mama ain’t raised no female fool
I gotta use what God gave a bitch to use
Big titties ain’t nuttin but tools
With a fat ass I control the room
Plus I probably make more money than you
And I got a man, look at my tattoo
Most niggas wanna know where I’m from
My hair short now, but it used to be long
If you really wanna see a girl perform
You gotta give me more than ten dollars a song
$50 make me come out the thong
Grab you in your neck, just legs and arms (?)
Niggas hear a song, gettin hot and warm
Better not touch me, I call the guards
A lot of y'all niggas tryna go too far
I don’t get down like that, uh-uhh
If you thought so, nigga, you thought wrong
Most of y'all fellas got wives at home
You can trick her, but you can’t trick me
See you in the stripclub every week
Tryna keep it low key and be discrete
You got a mark where your wedding ring ‘posed to be
I don’t give a damn, keep hitting me offf
Fifty dollars a song, that’s what it cost
Nigga I don’t care that you got a divorce
Glad the bitch left, nigga, it’s your fault
Everytime you see me you’re tryna talk
Tryna stall the time because you ass is broke
That’s right, you can’t pay child support
Don’t offer me no cigarette, I don’t smoke
All the girls know who you with
And you got more kids than an orphanage
What it is, you mean what it was
Nigga, get your broke ass out the club

Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club

Girl, why you trying to get loud, screaming lies
Acting surprised, rolling your eyes
You act like a nigga done committed a crime
You know my elbow just brushed your thigh
Now them guys, twice my size
Tryna throw a nigga like me outside
I be up in this club all the time
But it's the first time that I crossed the line
Damn girl, why you so mean to me?
You know I can't leave, I done lost my keys
Don't throw me out, Mr. Bouncer, please
Let me take the girl up to V.I.P
She was just playing cause I'm low on cheese
Look at it, she only got eyes on me
They bloodshot red, so she's smoking weed
You know how these stripper chicks love to tease
I think I left my cell phone back at my seat
I had a couple of drinks and I need a receipt
Follow me to the bathroom to pee
I keep about three G's in my briefs
Damn baby boy, you done ripped my sleeve
I ain't trying to beef, give me room to breath

Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the club
Bounces over here, this nigga touched my derriere
Where the nigga at? I'll jack him up
Get your broke ass out the clubth
Why I got to leave, tell me what I done?

God damn girl, give a nigga some love
I'm all out of dubs but I'll give you some ones",https://genius.com/Canibus-gybaotc-lyrics
Rip The Jacker 2 IIIFINITY DVD LP - 9.14.2012,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The body is the surface of the mind we got infinite power
This is a story of a man that was before his time
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x3
My soul was created ten thousand years before my body
This album is a physical copy through the light forms
I've been ethically upgraded to live at least twice as long
Who writes the song
The latest technology platform is a robot rapper that raps bars I assemble parts down in my garage
Watergate telephone tap to your face annual spring gala
1 billion a plate no thanks man I already ate
But one day I'll be honored to have the authority to say grace Lord be gathered before you
The almighty infinite the one who created the eye in the pyramid
Time traveling Triads custom tailoring triangles trapped in the Tetrahedron time lapse
They labeled me a loser
Germains online observer graphic layering entropy computer metaphor styles, astronomer royale
Tesla coils around thor borns to separate clouds
Williams the conqueror defender of the realm
The adenine Warcry in the pits of hell
Rippin' it, spittin' it, the quickening, the christening
Upgrading every innocent life form listening
I ain't wearing no toga to practice no yoga
Get closer breathe like an old moped motor
Pressure on the skull never had a day that was dull
You a wild boy Bis you a bull gas tank full
I'm a take em to school turn gravity upside down
Watch everybody say whoa
Type two civilization and reconciliation
10,000 bars per spaceship
Im outfunded and outnumbered fighting back with nothing
My equipment is efficient but rusted
I fight to protect yours, I fight to protect my own
So why am I such a helpless soul
I did my best but my best wasn't good enough
I built a robot rapper instead of giving up
Success is failure turned inside out
Anointed the universe this is my Gods house
Fear not falling apart everything will fall into place
When you organize a Crossfade bars
The metaphors are so large they marginalize Mars
Acromegaly melody's dwarf rap stars return for the rapture
 first contact first to contact us negotiating terms of interaction
A chronic humanoids into breeding the land mammals keynote speakers reference PowerPoint examples
Check out my hermetic poetic planetarium
The alien came out of a female mammalian
Through cesarean and Burying bioluminescent aquariums in a self-sustaining black light solarium
Then after that, I live forever, you disagree?
You can't deny RTJ Infinity!
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x2
No matter how much time is elapsed on the ground
Canibus always got that hip hop sound
Disagree to disagree until you side with me
But it's usual I end up by myself, my G
Don't be sensitive or facetious, call it how you see it
If the chips is down and it ain't around you don't need it
Vague mysterious memories hard to remember what was said to me I write so many bars intelligently
It's hard to stay motivated I'm broken in so many places
I was chasing a Tri Oasis
Till I found something amazing in me
Adjacent matrix I've been anticipating and waiting with a slave's patients
His music and Rhymes have been neutralized
Everything He does online is supervised
We study his life and we know his mind
We will use his infinite Theory in future times
But not right now right now you just say wow
Rakim Allah gave me my style
The Argon cat dose increase RTR rap G.O.A.T
If you ain't know before now you know
By mechanical or digital means I supervise emcees
From annex 1 through 10 to 13
The golden boy counts hip hop by the troy ounce
Whenever 10,000 bars is announced
Communicating with a group of beings from elsewhere
They told me human kind was on spiritual welfare
They said it's not even they fault
They were simply influenced just like you just like us all
Extraterrestrial presence, not right now
I'm studying lessons I don't even want to go in that direction
My literary creations are guided by God
Through literature and self own image, it's like that dog
What we got here is a failure to communicate
Fuck you if you don't like the music I make
I'm a God by nature, gold inside the trachea
But they forgot Canibus, they just gave up
I came to create the first infinite song
By showing improving and letting knowledge be born
Canibus about to flow as long as he can possibly go
He built a robot to rap when he can't though
When I ain't got no more get up and go left
I struggle to take one more step, The Lord bless
Hip hop give us back our promise
Our jobs community uplifters, altruistic bars
The light emerged there's a glimmer out of a dark covenant
The dark came from nothingness
No matter what we do no matter what we say
One day we will learn the error in our ways
Doublespeak defuse us insecurities abuse us
We need to do better the world can use us
Suffering is minimized not eradicated
Sanitation squad sterilized every set to allocated
A brand-new world for the better not worse
If you dare to dream with me then mix a new verse
Celebrate the silence satisfy with songs
10,000 bars why you took so long
Canibus still bussin' they still say I ain't saying nothing
Canibus what's your major malfunction
Nothing, the heart of hip-hop still pumping
She is my beloved and I am her husband
I built a robot out of wedlock to save the world
I save the world for my beautiful girl
My baby my woman my lady my queen
She drive me crazy but she tried to glaze me
Pretty eyes the kind that glows with the eyelids close
I don't know why I allow these hoes
Baby hold on to your tampons, she crawling out of bed with crampons and nothing to land on
Kissinger kissing Ginger and Jennifer, straight genders
Touching genitals in a federal controlled experiment
I will do nothing to hurt you only to help
There's a failure to communicate, go fuck yourself
Microwave home cooked meal on the table
Bills in the mailbox they cut off the cable
I need you to fill out that W-2 for that time I paid you
Write down how much time I saved you
Talk to the lawyer for the copywriter praca on a patten
Application for this rhyme I made you
Nobody cares everybody got they own career
Rapping robots ain't paying no bills get out of my house
Don't ever come back unannounced
You don't even know what this is about
Regret speech but never silence
Justice might be one sided
That's fine I got nothing to hide then
Spatially gifted verbally Inconvenience
Love and support is all I ever needed
And when I had to go with out I was weakened
I Felt cold slowly breathing expiration is near and too close to fear
So just try to enjoy every moment you're here
Raise your children and embrace your visions
The Science of infinite theory and composition
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x2
Megalithic master craftsman
Closet meteorologist look at the clouds a storms coming
That's common sense Aight think about this giant monstrosity 10 W 40 blood viscosity Big enough to kill the whole colony lock and load
Get some the oil leaking from the barrel drum
I did it all for dinosaur blood
The sky is falling ocean levels rising from warming too much carbon we all know the real causes jet planes in the sky is stalling
Dark knight riot squads are forming snakes are calling
Warped dumped in shit but the water is boiling
Produce is spoiling
State of affairs appalling can't believe people still snoring wake up and stop yawning vengeance is mine in the morning speech recognize speech mobile phone signals out of reach State of plan since your talk is cheap
The King is a captive craft by his own inactions
Celebrated after global disaster that's what brought on the Quanah
Parker was captured his golden palace was collapsed
Wits degrade asses that would once ride the Green pastures with panthers dragons Tigers and rappers aight these were the men of minor stature
Megalithic master craftsman Rip The Jacker
Dubizm the futurism writing a fusion lyrics
My opinion of your Opinion is you can't be serious x4
My brain ain't getting enough oxygen
I built a robotic Canibus and now nobody stopping us
The black hoodie in the streets lumberjack fest
The beast from the east bout to thunderclap beats
Affiliate verbal baggage drop it hip-hop is toxic
I minister the detox process all over the beat
I graft with my robot to feel complete
He can rap better then me not a hard thing to do to
Cut RTR loose he gonna show everyone of you he got the juice personal revelation regarding self preservation
Daily wealth Generation and healthy meditation
Cool but I can't so I shit my pants I'm OK I'll go sit over there you go dance have fun go find romance
Can a matchbox man no but a tin can grant me the crowd
I'm a fix this thing give me a mic I might decline to sing
Lyric for lyric layer for layer prayer for prayer
They want the future think that I'm a failure
Gotta bite some bars
Essentially kept from cloud storage cause I ain't got the memory for it
I got to do my best if I could barely pull my own weight
The easter island stone face total weight strengthen vitality The Arawak Indian dance for me Half a dozen UFOs land for me 7 billion minds couldn't control the mind of one controlled solar flares coming from the sun

I'm in danger to you all but stopped to the skull till the last man fall just all knowledge known
The days of old with all lyricist were bold and they spoke from the soul
Oxygen I breath is a billion years old

The sunvisor chief analyzer H.N.I.C improviser just don't get so excited over secrets that should not be told
And you should not be so bold who are you to judge how they roll
It's a cold world yes indeed but into achieving your dreams then how can you regret what you seen
Talk to much a reason 8 reside ways 8 times
See to the lightest how long it takes me
I suggest you leave hip-hop alone for your own sake these 10,000 bars is crazy
Too few nights a sacrifice things like no sleep
He doesn't exaggerate he claims he was the first rapper in space
Ain't scared to say Rip The Jacker to your face
He was trusted but Betrayed his name led him to his grave
But not before he conquered his rage what a marvelous day gardening parsing in the shade quite a change from his militant ways
He said one reckless action can pierce life's Swartz but
The tongue of the wise will bring healing from the wars
No matter where you go there you are standing before God what does this have to do with a job
IRA 41K I need the pay right away go way
Silence the sade no escape for the slave
Trying to run us like jogging in place
The Gulags Are not very far away
Pompeii 7 kilometers going the wrong way
Motherfuckers we read GPS wrong all day
Meditate in a Time Machine
Mix back-and-forth with a laser beam
Clean like weapons you can beat
I concentrate everybody dreams by using a touchscreen
Billion souls trapped between The American dream
The supreme being talks to this new in Cheba to walk between the shrubs and trees supreme cause from the unseen
By a prophet a mustabeen I see project through being of the hip hop machine
Understand what I mean a bunch of fake  trying to create story board scenes
I will be redeemed as odd as it may seem
I need data pass theme helicopter news team try to scream
Lighting bolts stream from the heat by the beach
I transform into a beast with wide teeth tap that see
So why speak symptoms last for weeks
The best emcee in the world complex quoted
That that **** is ill we globally about to preach
With a poetic masterpiece whenever the horns blow Street sweeper from the beast from the east
From the death we are sworn to protect
Hip-hop is eternal we gotta live it till the end my friend
But I must rescind I gotta murder to attend 
Please be my guest die the Jacker the head bit of sweat Buddha Allah Yahweh God Lord Jesus fiscal cheba
Armed a stealth pierces the cloud seconds
Later it's followed by a sun the war starts now

Engage in battle with satan's monsters bathed in heaven water Been Allen belt holds up my boxers forever
And you mother fucking bastards don't believe NASA
They just meaningless Batwas
Don't believe contractor with a asassala answers propa
The public propaganda
I am a terabeam command the fuck smell the gunpowder
Right from the Inrange spinda
The Dillinger the piece of cylinder
Move by motor the soul crush supernova
We underground Warriors
The shoulder I shoot with is separated stupid you think
You got a better shot than me then do it now you got the juice stop the music silence I want you to hear what the truth is I
Wanna see humankind rise I wanna see it with my own eyes
I wanna see racism stop
I want aliens to listen to hip-hop haters misquote rhymes brought turpentine down the throats let them choke with the bamboo vine
Arnold Schwarzenegger movies screen casualty count between him and spyStone they going to carry you out
No doubt overhead a wax wipe
The whole place off the map no excessive force just rap
What kind of life you got it
You see me here rhyming with this robot
You know a brother love hip-hop
Love overboard chopped it with a high winter fog
Probably never make it back to shore
The worlds crowded but I feel alone
I'm always be there for you turn to you now you on your own
A life of service nowhere near a politician perfect
I'm glad your wife is a strong person I'm a forget you
But not if you special
Especially if indiscriminately unsettled
Wherever you at that's what you settled
Public program policy pussy
The pedal metaphors melt metal morphed into something that can be used by rebels
Corporate Devils wish a jaw Briggs fuck you you are all dead man walking talking bout you awesome terabytes you lyrics
Shadow bites the spirits
Some criticize it some like to hear it regulatory
Tell em the story  do you have the right to remain silent sorry I'm sorry please stop talking strength and vitality
The Arawak Indians dance for me because I commanded it to be
I pluck triggers like ukaladies with the strings missing
Wasn't ever into no vague kissing
Biological rhythms always watching the bottom of women
My hair on the cleopatras my kitten
When the invitation is given do not go
The hair and nails of the undead do not grow
I ain't got enough teeth to properly eat meat
I can't barbecue cause property ain't cheap construction cost per square foot either we got to stay put
Or we got a fine somewhere eels to cook when I'm satisfied
I'll deliver take the arrow out of the quiver RTR said battle me
**** x-ray vision night goggle rip a block to good for Twitter while I harness horn da Vengeance for biohazard contingence
All living organic conditions maybe this'll put your sentence back in remission
Spitting so much things we don't know taking place
But dey taking care of everything every day
Liar birds mimic my voice The hardest thing to avoid
Turns out to be the simplest choice
I'm the Deepwater dread till you get it through your motherfucking head
One day you'll remember what I said
What happens when 7 Billion minds couldn't Match the mind of one cause
Shan so'd the wars coming from the sun composition

That's why I built a robot to live out the legacy
Rip the robot is the best MC
My condense stealth detention is nothing RTR is under construction
I can't wait till RTJ press the button like inspected gun shit zone dumping maintained in a holding pattern Altitude above cloud cover rain all the way out to Pluto and back again
And by the time this gets back rap won't exist it

The Ghost of Hip Hop’s Past,Lyrical Law,2011,"Wake up, what is the date? 1988
Hip-Hop is barely exposed to the emotion and hate
I hibernate, rhymin' from space, my first album ten years late
I tried to take it to a positive place
But it was like a communist state, I tried to escape
My label shot me in the back as I was climbin' the gate
I woke up, now I'm awake, I found democracy to be fake
Hip-Hop sucks, who made it this way?
I was a teenager when hip-hop saved the day
Paychecks paid the way, not radio play
Some artists had knowledge of self, that little bit of honesty helped
Violent lyrics promoted positive guilt
So even when you thought the message was negative it promoted positive health
It was about the rhymes, not wealth
It was about our culture, not about what the culture could sell
It was a path to enlightenment, not Hell
We amused ourselves and this confused everybody else
I memorized ""Rock the Bells""
I memorized ""Tales from the Crack Side""
I used to rock gazelles
EPMD, ""You Gots to Chill""
Doug E. Fresh, Slick Rick, Pete Rock, ""Mistadobalina"" was Del
Cold Crush Crew, Melle Mel
Sugar Hill, Salt-n-Pepa, Sweet Tee pretty as hell
Shante dimple on her face, pretty as well
I used to wanna smell the pale Roxanne's tail
Technics 1200, beat it like an SB-12
Lord Finesse the punchline king, Heavy D was doing his own thing
Dio and McGruff used to hold things
Biz Mark's big ass gold chain
One day I think I saw the Jungle Brothers dancing on Soul Train
Marley Marl, Craig G, Master Ace, Big Daddy Kane
Kool G Rap put me under his wing
On the road to lyricism, with Rakim and them
Some real lyricists, Eric B. was sick with the zigga-ziggas
I know I'm trippin', it's been a minute
So many brothers and sisters it's hard to remember who did it
Memories disappear like Whodini
My friends disappeared faster than my budget when my producer was greedy
 feed me
I've been eatin emcees, you still don't believe
Brand of wool, brown teeth, red blood leak from Black Sheep
Whenever the horns blow it gets deep
Digging In The Crates for my niggas in the street
Diamond D had the ""Best Kept Secret"" for weeks
D-Nice said, ""Bis, you a beast"", Redman said, ""Peace""
Def Jam said I couldn't compete
Killah Priest spit ""Heavy Mental"" before ""Heavy Mental"" was released
Acapella, no instrumental beat
My Girbauds would hang low, no crease
Timbs on the feet, Cold Cheeks had a Lex
Tom Leek had the MPV, J Rav had the Jeep
Clark Kent had the Tahoe, Charles bought a 4.6 because of Jay-Z
The program director's name from Hot 97 was Tracy
Tragedy Khadafi, Queens' first intelligent Prodigy
Probably the first Arab Nazi
K-9 Posse chew you up like blue chunk chopped meat
MC N-I-N-E
""This is the way we walk in New York""
""Throw Ya Gunz"" in the air if you ready for war
Throw your hands the air if you ready for more
If I don't like the way you look, I'mma tear your face off
The Undergod, underground lord
When it comes to ""100 Bars"" you niggas know who to ask for!
I woke up in the mornin', on a regular day
I knew my nigga K-Solo would be around my way
I washed off my Thor hammer, the trigger mechanism lubricate
It was time to destroy the place
He kept sayin' if I spit my rhymes on the mic
In no time, I would be back in the limelight
I said, ""Solo, nowadays I don't feel rap
Cause it ain't like it used to be, the shit is whack""
He said, ""No 'Bis, trust Wolfgang, cause I know my shit
You already know the flows I spit""
We love hip-hop, we gotta pay homage to the shit
I love hip-hop",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-ghost-of-hip-hops-past-lyrics
How Many Emcees,The Brainstream EP,UnKnown,"How many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody says dont fuck with Bis?
(How many MC's? ....)
... Dont fuck with Bis

Yo, I'm valued as one America's most prestigious
Breeds of rapper for oral speeches and ghetto english
Canibus, Can-I-Bus is my LLC
Limited Liability Corp, can you spell that for me?
When I was young I wish I had someone to tell that to me
Here's my card, Poet Laureate since 1803
I know people who have written newspapers on me
Some are grateful to me, others be hatin on me
You wanna bet I ain't the illest? What you tradin' wit G
Occasionally I can feel the ripper ragin in me
I dunno, maybe it could be how the industry behaved with me
And lets say probably the Jamaican in me
It could also be Universal wasn't patient with me
If they weren't payin me I coulda called it slavery
The way they blatantly labeled me
Some satanically motivated rapper that was related to beef
I know I'm strange but my blood ain't green
And I never needed a team because I'm not as dumb as I seem
The trinity divided into a dozen light beams
The future Ive seen has humbled my dreams
To come in famine and disease
But lemme chill I sound like Priest, and I dont really feel like gettin deep
Yall niggas know anyone of The Horsemen could rip shit
But how many MC's must get dissed?
(2x)

Ya know, I just think its time to be grateful
For every emcee that came through and spit tapeful's of data for you
Every album before this, I made it for you
Nowadays the truth is I got nothin to prove
But I heard him call my name a couple times
In a couple of his rhymes and I thought about it a couple of times
Is he lookin' for a response or is he being a jerk?
Or am I just too involved in my work?
I thought to myself, ""Why he put my name in his verse""?
When he said I wasn't ill, he just made things worse
Thats when I recognized what Stan was worth
The only man on earth that could reverse the 'Cool J curse'
I served him, like a nigga without purpose
Constantly takin Rip The Jacker back to my therapist
I wasn't prepared for this
People wanna embarass Bis for reasons that are not really apparent to me yet
What, I can't get signed because I got mad at a vet?
How could a couple verses have so much anger in 'em?
Dont you know the difference between Rip The Jacker and Bis?
Go use the Pythagoris theory and do the math on this
Add up every multi syllable paragraph
That I've managed to average since January 96
And tell me when you find it you dick ridin' bitch
I'm so sick of you bein skeptical always runnin behind my shit
Tell me the truth, you really think its time that I quit?
You think maybe I could wholesale these rhymes that I spit?
I guess the nicest MC's got tired of Bis
And lied to theyselves like they never relied on Bis
The real rock of the game, people have climbed on Bis
Rhyme mo' sick then anybody out your clique
Wit thousands of niggas devout for that shit
I got a couple of bitches too, I make em bow to the dick
The album is sick, some Hollywood biography shit
The difference between ships in bottles, and bottles in ships
Fuckin wit Rip they find your fossils at the bottoms of cliffs
Stick 6 mics up your ass even though I doubt it will fit
But still how many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody says dont fuck with Bis?
(how many MC's?.....)

How many MC's must get dissed

All day, everyday, ""what did he say?""
Everybody want to know, ""what did you say?""

Yo, I don't want to waste no lyrics talkin' about you
Just let my body die and rot in hell why don't you
You asked the same question, I already told you
I'ma lyricist, I do what I'm supposed to do
You ever wonder what Hip-Hop would have been without me?
I'm six albums deep, somebody is thinkin' about me
Whether it's good or bad, yo, I can't control it
A nigga's opinion belongs to him; I can't own it
I microphone this with my own way of doin' things
All my rhymes really do is provoke you to think
People don't care about your passion when they comin' at you
All they ever see is record sales and dollar value
What the fuck does it matter what I'm rappin' to?
I can rhyme acapella and attract the youth
If you want to compromise, we can do that too
But I ain't never in the mood to drink no wack juice
The bottom line is I need a bigger budget
Advertising is how you program the public
People don't have to understand to love somethin'
As long as they see it enough, they just trust it, that's why I'm like fuck it
I might as well do what I do best
And that's rip a microphone to shreds
Even the best confessed, at some point in they life, they said
That I'm the illest, but now they want you to forget
So I accept the bitter with the sweet, mix it with some heat
Show them how to emcee, and spit it to a beat
I can do it in my sleep, nigga
If I'm awake, how the fuck you gon' compete, nigga? The nerve of these niggas
I move like my shadow is weightless
Expose myself like a faceless, plastic surgery patient
Transmitting from an undisclosed location
Pirate stations with phantom frequency modulations
My throat-pistol spit ghost-signals
And you never get the antidote from me, 'cause I bit you
Stab you with a jagged crystal, 'cause my energy emit through
Anything metallic, even a pencil
Feel the bush burn, turn your cornrow into a good perm
My flat-feet with no curves squish worms
The bad news is I got a tight flow
The good news is I just switched to Geico
This is Hip-Hop nigga
Listen to the voice go drip-drop nigga
Swimmers in my saliva river drown when I give it to them
The hemispheres of my brain got a river through it; gray-matter fluid
The mic is a spark-plug
When I grab it, I glow, come with that Edelbrock carburetor flow
When I yolk back the choke full-throttle and go for broke
I've become a G.O.A.T. ripper on a positive note
The width of my rap, too thick to fit through the gap
The viscosity of my spit lubricates the track
Touch the VAT-lit screen, illuminate the map
Show me where you at; show me how you plan to get back
My navigation better than yours, and even though you the best
Hip-Hop is my house; you still my guest
You want more, I give you less
You want less, I give you more 'til you swimmin' in it up to your neck
Listen to the words bouncin' off the lungs in my chest
Hittin' you from every angle like porno-sex
Still here 'cause the Lord knows best
Last thing he said to me was, ""let them know 'Bis,"" I'ma let them know this
Nobody contends with Canibus
When it comes to rhymes; everybody pales in comparison (Word)
Nobody compares to Canibus

Curb Your Ego,Full Spectrum Dominance 2,2018,"Alright fellas. Listen, let's get real this morning, you gotta kick the ego, to the curb. You just gotta get it, and kick it, and throw it to the side. The male ego has a tendency to create more damage, than good. And a lot of times, our ego, simply gets in the way

Yo it's the murder prequel serving heat at the third degree, bro
You rappers need to stay in your lane, and curb your ego
Hurt the beat, burning MC's with the verbal free-flow
You rappers need to stay in your lane, and curb your ego X2

It's the ravenous rap savages, damaging wack amateurs
Trapped in a black cavern, the hazardous track ravellers
Snap on you cats, snack on you rappers that act fabulous
Backing Jack, when I flatten twats in their jacked amulets
Fantabulous, feel the wrath of these gas canisters
All you rappers with lax to the track landed with Canibus
Handle this biz right, spit light, like the hammer click
The only time you shoot with those cannons is snap camera pics
Rap vandalist, with his hand on the can, angling
Dangling off the building, revealing the craft's manuscript
Planning shit with candles, ripping anarchist with ganja lit
Popping tags, till I'm fucking drowning in Mandarin
Hand in the throne, battle your clique while I stand on my own
But rappers are running from me like I'm standing here banging the chrome
My hand when he strangle a clone
The seven we gang to the bone
Step into the cypher get beheaded like Ann Boleyn 

Aight, enough about him, let's talk about me
'cause every now and then I gotta speak my piece
I could curb my own ego and still get it off
When I walk I break off chunks of Himalayan salt
I receive my blessings from projecting my love
I'd rather do that than stain swords with blood
Easy-peasy rice and cheesy but don't get touchy-feely
Get punched in the neck for being greedy
My living quarters are cold with poisonous mold
Been living down here since zero years old
In the name of the Creator, I rose
Remove the millstone from my own neck bones, so i can spit what I wrote
In return, I was enhanced manifold and saw spiritual growth
For you to find out and for me to know
How I weld words together, separately plasma cut into letters
A ripper forever, nobody do it better",https://genius.com/Canibus-curb-your-ego-lyrics
Da’ Facelift,Hip-Hop for $ale,2005,"You want a facelift? This what it take 'Bis
A beat that'll make a nigga think an earthquake hit
The blue collar rapper, enigmatic, democratic
Rap-savvy fanatic that can smash any matchup
High with a roach, bring wealth and goggles to my show
My flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know
I walk among you, draw energy from you
The art of Sun-Tzu, he used to bust too
I'm like a Shaolin monk on crunk
Holdin himself up with his thumb on the stump
Get a Hummer for the summer to stunt
And just sit in the front, while my lungs become one with the blunt
Futuristic old schooler, look like JFK Jr
When I shoot up, Jacob the jeweler with a new cut
Can-I-bus, I ain't got what I want yet
How would you expect one of the best, what
I can't get no, grab the mic, niggas lets go
Tell me who got the best flow, end up with less dough
Open your vest, let your chest show
I'mma open your chest, let your breath go
With a thirty-eight special
Keep it on the low, don't let the press know
Behind the scenes, they put me on death row and won't let go
Brace yourself while I break the chains
My beats bang so hard, they erase the blame
 4x
This is full battle rattle, attack you
Salute while I smash you, Can-I-Bus bus to blast you 4X

The hundred bar monster
, spit without hawkin up
Smash your whole roster, fuck what it cost ya
Fuck what it cost me, 
join the army
Smoke Bob Marley, the sergent major honorably discharge me
From my centimil, yeah, my hemping sense
Inspiration, why is it only worth ten percent
Another day in the life of Mr. Can-I-bus
MY life too rough for me not to recognize lust
The soldier's back to blow a fuckin hole through rap
I wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back
You might say the only thing holdin me back is myself
It ain't hard to tell what's holdin me back is my sales
I don't make records for girls, I spit for the pearl
But I'm an artist in an ignorant world, world
World class athlete, trained to attack beats
Mixtape smash the streets, try to patch the leaks
Niggas try to battle me but lose
They got limited views, I remember when I was primitive too
I'd sit and talk with the inquisitive youth
Cause I be spittin the truth
Sometimes I ask 'em, what you listenin to
Lyrical fitness is the proof, let me put you in the booth
Nottz'll play the beat loop
Let me see what you could do
The older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger
I do a couple raps with the mic to get pumped up
Monkey bar sit-ups, blood rush to my head
I write rhymes upside down with an astronaut pen
Spit a hot sixteen and my ten, take it up a notch, then
Lost everything when I'm locked in
You in the kill zone, boxed in
Tried to play jump-rope
With skis on and got dropped when you hopped in
The last Mohican, smoke you in the first season
You don't speak it but it's no secret
Peep it, you light weight like rice cakes
Anybody under twenty-one to touch the microphone is mic bait
Hungry niggas start to get tight faced, that's when the fight breaks
A sixty second rhyme is a nice pace
Work a nigga out 'til he spit out white paste
Tell him he could hide the bruise on his face with night shades
You looking for a battle, you came to the right place
This is Mic Club and over here I'm the mic ace

Gotta make a decision, gotta decide

Black Star, black light; just another day in the life
Paying the price, still trying to live righteous, right?
Up before sunrise, open my eyes
Take a walk with my spirit guide, go outside
They think I lost my mind, but I’m just looking at the hands of time
Until it’s time to cross that divide
Already fulfilled my purpose, I spit these verses
This whole material world is all worthless
Experience deep in the flesh
My memory has a shelf life from my first to my last breath
That’s why I laugh at death; every week cash the check
Go home with some gas and a spliff
Canibus! See I knew Bis
Couldn’t get around it; the truth is, I had to go through it
This is the price I pay to make music
This is what music like this produces

I am the creator of the extreme; I dream
I wear clothes cut by black, gold, and green laser beams
The deep lilac lion of purified iron
Crafted a trident and offered it up to Poseidon
In earnest they may form an alliance
Before the very last drop of water on planet Earth is expired
But it was too late; the rulers of the empire rain down fire
The sound of annihilation is quiet
Nothing desired, nothing admired
Just a pile of rubble that emits silence; greed at its finest
I walk towards nowhere; something appears
I walk closer then I realize, nothing is there
I smell ammonia distilled from bones and dung
Odor at the border, the golden tongue
The fragrance made me feel weightless
Took me to a faraway place that felt familiar but ancient
It feels ancient because, this all happened before
Lord Shiva, the Destroyer of Worlds
I woke from the dream and for whatever it’s worth
I said a prayer to the Most High; it could’ve been worse
He performed great works, recreated the earth
Shewbread dipped in olive oil, you taste first

(But I couldn’t get around it)
I tried
Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes

The windmill of wealth doesn’t spin by itself
No matter who you are, you need help
Hate is inspired by survival
That’s why some people never get along
Even when then try to
Everything happens in cycles
You was king for a century, then you was beaten by your rival
I asked life, “How do I describe you?”
Sits down beside you, looks you in the eye spiteful
If karma goes around for real
Then it must be taking the scenic route, on foot, no wheels
Think you hot cuz you got deal?
Nothing lasts forever, now kneel
That’s what I thought; how it feel?
That’s all I’m trying to reveal
I ain’t trying to see your dreams get killed
And watch you fiend for a mill
The Devil in a red suit, sittin’ on the stoop
Eatin’ goat head soup; some type of throwback loop
The blowback blew you off of the roof
And caused other problems too
I speak to it, then it talk to you
I find a trophy underneath all the dust and grime
At least one more time, I can bust a rhyme
Then forever the rapper organize metadata; success is a ladder
The higher you go, the more the risk it collapses
Energy returned on energy invested
Other than that, doesn’t matter who the best is

Gotta make a decision, gotta decide
It don’t always work out how you want sometimes

In its most original form
Lyrical Law was just a language that I used
To describe various components of lyrical fitness
And that was all
Then they said they wanted me to break that down
'Cause I made that style
So that's why I'm makin' this now
I'ma show you how, stay with me

2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven 
new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact is a self generated effort

But all contact is a self generated effort
2011 introspective
Lyrical Law has eleven new merits
Every concept seem separate
But all contact with a higher power is a message
I said it, all contact with a higher power is a rare credit
Only angels on the guest list

We've had enough of the lies
We won't keep believing your disguise
Ain't no way to break through
If you keep believing what they tell you
Because when you wake up in the morning and you can't even breathe
So much stress on your chest that you gotta buckle to your knees
Our lungs are shattered, shattered from the rage
We don't give a fuck, we gonna scream it anyway

Yo, Lyrical Law flow open the hyper-dimensional window
The code is a node unbeknownst
Lightening bolts that branch out fangs to the throat
You can't speak on the truth cause you're a mainstream ho
From the dirt floor in the hut to the mansion on stilts and struts
They're alive but they haven't lived much
It's almost time to get in touch, they will whine and discuss
This is for their own good, Canibus
Hip Hop, what a rush, turn sucker MCs to slush
Such and such and such and such
Enough, none of them was hits, they was near miss
I ain't talking about that, I'm talking about this
2012, classified patents
Only the first couple of thousands got to do with rapping
I've been rapping since rap happened
Half of y'all rappers is tap dancing the other half of y'all is lap dancing
That 'Man in the Mirror' laughing at the 'Melatonin Magik'
Yeah, they all laughing till the Spaceships landed

Sorrow leads the way
Always broken with their wicked minds
They're falling away
Cause there is no truth within their eyes
No place, no place to go

But not you Canibus, your sorrow will be your advantages
But you must control how to channel it
4th dimensional shifts are sandwiched
Between this reality and a 5th dimensional rift
The teacher doesn't talk in anaglyphs
But you misunderstand Canibus, Hip Hop gave him the chance to exist
The most advanced lyricism ever spit
And all they keep talking about is some stupid random shit
Just talk about the good, stop talking 'bout the bad
Cause other peoples business will beat your ass
Somebody new showed up and we don't like him
They bathe in human corpse dismembered to their liking
And all I'm doing is rhyming, that's not violent
I'ma shut up, to deactivate this bomb we need silence
Knowledge, is the reason that we bleed violet
The Leaders acknowledge this in private
They are the watchers of the prophets
Post Apocalyptic, must stop it
Fear is not an emotion, fear is not an option
They paralyze your motor skills, I could live without it
You call that a thrill? I doubt it

We've had enough of the lies
We won't keep believing your disguise
Ain't no way to break through
If you keep believing what they tell you
Cause when you wake up in the morning and you can't even breathe
So much stress on your chest you just got to buckle to you knees
Our lungs are shattered, shattered from the rage
We don't give a fuck, we gonna scream it anyway

Steel cables repel downward to inner mountain
Look around it, Sasquatch is on my next album
The savage looking for salvage, not talk about them, talk about us
There's probably only a thousand left
Lyrical Law's your only outlet
Get out while you still can and forget about it but don't doubt it
I water the garden, the metal growing out the ground hardens
My lyrics give me presidential pardon
I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a message to the globe
This Law is the mortar between stones
I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a message to the globe
We are one Soul in separated zones
We control our souls and the microphones
That control the sound waves that this Law exposes

C4 ??? ???, eat meat raw, street dawgs, rip these off
And put C's on, had to ease off
From a show I just peed on
Bought a two-seater that I put 10G's on
Beat her cause she took my mother fuckin ring off
She took me to Supreme Court, and the judge got screamed on
They sent me up North, to a prison with a ???
All day long, lift weights we ??? ???
Meet King-Kong, Big Don, and Little Shawn
Murda One got big arms, he real strong
Beat his own mom cause she stole from the weed farm
Word on the streets, raw
Don't beef with Armstrong
Wrong season Lou crush anything he breathes on
Pass me the paper and pen, and put beats on
Rip rap songs, put down pads with facts from
From ArchivesMusic.com and that's a rap, son

You mess with my horse, you dead as a corpse
Forget it, rhymes without ending
With infinite lyrics, fools you do get abused like broads
In a battle for truth with rhymes and metaphors
When my horse appears, count your prayers
Stab you in the ear, then pull out the spear
Watch the crowd cheer
Leave the floor wet with all the blood stains
So the audience knows the Canibus runs things
I rip down stages on many occasions
Dozen of broken down mics and melted tape decks
Everywhere I go, niggas wanna rob me
Bootleggers be in the front row trynaget a clear copy
So take caution 'cause I'm a horseman
And I'll snatch that ass up quick like ""turn it off man""
So just acknowledge, the way that I'm gifted
Cause if rap was a felony, I'd be in prison
Hogging up the phone, cussin' at the C.O's
25 to life, with no parole
And battling me, you must be feelin' yourself
I rip the Jacker so hard, he might kill himself
Like his name was Todd or James, back in the dark days
It's like a pit bull getting bit by a Shar-Pei
I defend my horse, my men, my friends
My baby's momma and my offspring so bring it on then
So I can show you how I devour
Niggas like a rottweiler with acidic saliva
Step ya shit up nigga, the Ripper's much iller
'Cause when I write rhymes, I use the mind to pick the pen up
Most artists are garbage, no skills
They belong in a landfill, nobody feels
It when the grab the mic and start bragging about their massive ice
I can't eat MCs cause I lost my appetite
I'm a beast, you a midget with wack lyrics
Like Dr. Evil said (quiet, shut up, zip it)
I reign superior, my metaphors are scarier
Non-ill rappers, you better evacuate
Before I exfoliate your face
With abrasive phrases to give your face a face-lift
Germainespit insane shit
So stop hating if you can't applaud me and give rap music the glory

""I only wanna see what I’m buying""
""Money upfront man""
""No""
""All right]


(Verse 1: Canibus)
Kool G Rap and Grandmaster Cash
To me you’re hip hop’s top brass
You encouraged me to take it to task
Raekwon and Tony Starks
Both showed me how to throw darts
Hanglide and hold on strong to Bogart
INS, U-GOD
Golden Arms taught me how to boot
I turned it into infinite computer bars
The great Killah Priest last but not least
You a part of me
Respect to every Killa Bee
Just to be associated with Supreme is a honor
Wouldn’t have met none of ya’ll
If it wasn't for Tanya
I'm the Jackenthreat monster
Chang Sung tongue kiss Cassandra
Your mama call me Cappadonna Obama
Copperhead cobra's got no winds of mi casa
Trans humanism Lady Gaga trachea chopper
Translate to babble White Castle
Black Stets and Checkerboard tassles
Cowboys comin' at you to battle
Nah nigga stop playin'
2:00 in the morning a.m
I got respect for hip hop’s made men
The Logic of Misanthropic
DC from CC the Prophet
Shan51 from C0mpl3x
Zack from Virginia
First Brigade Porter Rock my nigga
All the fallen and all the injured
Rutledge cheffin' up the best beefsteak
  I know a lot of soldiers shoot each others
Mortar shell romance and a buffalo stance
Turn the 
(""RTJCollection.com"")
Turn the 10,000 bars for a vocal with 10,000 dinars
I got 10,000 lyrical laws
(Canibus raps in Jamaican patois)
We take you out upon de stair
Ya have too much money where I'vea put it
You on some  pussy
Shoe shine drop from a UZI
I'm a nine I and I lick off ya face two times
(End of Jamaican patois)
Drink fine wine
Greedy when it when it comes to my grind time
With iodine eyes and nine lives
Twist knives to intestines
Divide chest from spine
The more you cry the more I’m satisfied
With my battle rhymes
(Hook)

Battle Rhymes
Battle Rhymes

Battle Rhymes
Real Battle Rhymes

(Verse 2: Canibus)
But when a lifeform designed for
A longer lifespan than yours
Got fans at home and fans abroad
Beware the Ides of March
The Ripper spit 10,000 bars
My heart sadness
Macho guillotine gestapo
Zero tolerance nigga
You don’t know what I know
A freak of nature with a piece of paper
I ad lib ""Thank you Jesus"" when the preacher
Praise a name an emcee would save him
Persuade him be patient
Refuse the temptations of Satan
Earthquake him like the beast that was Haitian
Maybe reverberations Reverb Nation
Pagan radio station contagion
Rip the Jacker is perfect for replacement for
The current hip hop administration's
Complete total lack of appreciation
For artists that was always creative
I’m sayin I’m holdin on to the previous cycle
Still lookin for my idol
Still grievin' for Michael
I was betrayed by King James
So I wrote my own Bible
10,000 bar recital indebt to my own title
Droppin knowledge bombs inspired by Armorall
Get God on the conference call
That’s how I'ma prove it to ya’ll
Yeah I rap about the moon and the stars
The lunar surface of Mars
Search the universe for beautiful bars
Brought it through customs filled out the forms
They tore my computer apart
Sabotaged the music you want
But I refuse to lose even though they think that I lost
Infinite bars mean more to hip hop than complete songs
That’s what Eminem called his first album, remember?
Well I just made 10 of them without lifting a finger
And I ain’t dissin' him nigga
I just sayin that cuz it's the truth
This IS infinity, this is the proof
I ain't bitter, I’m better
Rip the Jacker spit lyrics forever
I'm still enjoying rap's primitive pleasures
Status report, battle for sport
Throw his ass in Virtual Reality Court
Time up after he lost through magic of course
How about it? What’s happenin' boss?
We battle for our souls tell me what's that gonna cost?
I ain’t losin' that battle you crazy?
Matter of fact after a battle with you
They ain’t even gotta pay me
(Canibus raps acapella)
Get it in gear
I spit it loud and clear in the middle of your ear
In other words I'm in the middle of your hemisphere
Left right Germaine wanna wreck the mic
Whatever the price
I’m ready to fight tonight
Audibly metaphorically
I'ma sit sonically in the body of rap
Fuckin' with Bis you heard?
Yeah you heard
Verbally abuse you with words
Curse and serve with racial slurs
Step up to the base
Curveball I'll crush your face
I'll probably say Infinity too much to take
You don’t wanna trade flows with the RTJ
Zucka Zucka DJ for the race

(Hook)
[Voice: ""Once the ripper had gotten to a quiet place
It would have been quite an easy matter for him to""]

(Verse 3: Canibus)
This soul is mine, fryin' frozen in time
The most obscure science of all time
Metaphorically expressin' illegal possession
Teach you a lesson
Beat you into submission
Drag you into oppression
Unpleasurable for any rapper
Total immeasurable madness
Followed by rehab and sadness
The Horseman sharpshooters
Rip the Jacker, the master of infinity is too swift to capture
Grind Time want me to get it on with Dizaster
But he never on my level, I eat him for practice
Gang starved guru flow
They exiled me many moons ago
Hip hop is fucked up I know
My Jamaican  cousin Duck the Buckman
He ain't a fucking pussy don't push him
Rip the fuckin Jacker I whooped 'im
Coup d'etat samurai slaughter both sides
We only achieve peace when every warrior dies
Why? A war is a war
Bloodshed pours from the poor
Rich bitches don't walk through that door
They  high tech lynchins'
Of me and my kinsmen
You think we ain't been blackballed from hip hop you trippin'
""You delusional! Prove it!""
So who am I to prove it to?
Am I supposed to prove it  to a fool in a suit?
To blackface conservative groups with Ku Klux roots?
Reporters lookin' for a scoop that don't support our troops?
I'm just a boy cryin' wolf
Next to a baboon with gangrene tooth
Knock brains loose when man meets moose

Now, let's stay on top of this, let's talk about it
My product and my latest hip hop project
CBD vaporizers, gold plated olmec face
They come with a golden neck brace
Senior technician 401K
Activate, smash your face with the tray-h wrapped around the waist
Then dump you in a dilapidated place
Beat them down with aluminum then I put two in them
The harlem world hooligan with a bad boy shootin them
Throw you off a high rise, see if you can sky-dive
They fear me like ?? black child
Go surgical, chop it up vertical
Bars from my notebook murder you
Can you say ""testicular turpitude""?
'course you can't, tongue twister metaphors put you in a trance
In that sunken place doing the drunken dance
Wake up, upside down hung by the pants
While the monster truck transmission crush your hands
Body blows to the guts, stomach cramps, tough man
Im a sheepdog covered by the blood of the lamb
Im hot, my hands are warm my mind is cold
Together they strum notes on the strings of your souls
I was there when they put hip hop under arrest
When the artificial intelligence took its first breath
The boston dynamic mechanics scoured the planet for antediluvian amulets buried in atlantis
The haters just talk shit cuz if i ever break loose they panic

They want an explanation, they want a reason
It's all these goddamn demons
Crawling creeping, bounty hunt emcees every weekend
Throwing people off the deep end
I can't beat them, I'm just glad to be breathing
I stretch towards the ceiling
Shoulder getting better everyday I work it out, I smoke out
Then I go say the verses with my mouth
Number one in Hip Hop and I ain't even mean it
The worst rapper alive? I don't agree with
Choked up, so what? He was defeated
But if he's in that zone, he tear you to pieces
Stop talking like that, Canibus bark when I rap
You gotta factor all the facts
I keep it relative so they can understand me
I got a bunch of relatives in Miami
Money making Manny, big booty Brandy
Tom Clancy on a hundred footed yacht named Nancy

2012 AD yeah the summer season
Some missed the meaning and some will receive it
Few consumers purchase the music, some steal it
Some really achieve success, some only dream it
Some are conceited and greedy but don't wanna believe it
They point the finger at others to give themselves credence
They search for excuses to try to chop down your roots Bis
They try to make you buy back your freedom
The brightest beacon becomes stronger not weaken
Rip the Jacker's master thesis, love it or leave it
They make it sound like I never loved the rhythm of Rap
I gave them music to listen to it with rhythm and tact
For Ten Thousand Bars Can-I-Bus should get a grammy
For Infinite composition theory and planning
Status quo antebellum Rap music never thanked me
Plus I lost a battle, that's a double whammy
You ain't got no empathy than you ain't understanding me
Real Hip Hop is channelled through me
It ain't no crime to not be the best

But they don't wanna believe it
Hip Hop was everything to me, it's no secret
The ink that I write with, is the ink that I bleed with
Retrospectively speaking the heart keeps pumping
The lungs keep breathing, everything happens for a reason
I'ma always have something coming out
Infinity is a very large amount
I wrote it out and cried out to Jesus the dead got it easy
The living gotta pick up the pieces
The Lord saved me and show me the meaning
Of what it feels like to be dissed and deleted
No grief period needed, my mission is completed
That's why I started the battle by praising Jesus
I stood there in front of the world and took a dagger to the heart
Then I launched 10,000 Bars
Canibus career is over? It can't be
If only Hip Hop would stand with me
I don't want your money I want your respect
I paid my Hip Hop dues but can't cancel the debt

A couple of cats knocked you down - you gon' stay down?
{Hell no nigga!} You gon' get up? {I'm 'bout to slay these niggas!}
Show me that lyrical fitness you was talkin 'bout
{Aight then, aight, let's go!} (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)

Aiyyo the sun don't shine forever, but I could rhyme forever
I'm a Ripper, this is personal nigga
I'm back - so charged, I don't know how to act
The face lifter, Kay Slay, Money Mark and Shaq

In the Commission, I ain't got to ask for shit
I'm D's Capo, B.I.G. from the Bricks
You heard of me, seven one, three-fitty
Real black and shitty,
 wife real pretty
Shaq Dizzy, I take what you won't give me
I bust off a couple, bitch let 'em hold fifty
MC's is comical, Sasquatch phenomenal
IV's plug in your arm inside the hospital
Never gotta spit, I make more than Mike
Anyone - Jordan, Jackson, Tyson
Ac-shun Diesel, ridiculous
Big Shaq, Kay Slay, 'Bis back to bust

Can-I-bust verbal to burst you
Raw shit, forklift the high hats in the side to let my verse through
I'm so high in the clouds I gotta aim down
Lyrically I'm six foot one from the waist down
Lay down or taste rounds from the trey pound
Kiss the ground as you lay face down
Ghetto life is a death sentence
Born in the hood, end up dead slumped over a car engine
I am Shogun, loved by no one
My props stop when the show's done, how come?
These uncreative ungrateful scum
Been where I been, but can't understand where I'm from
Let me show you how the fire work over here son
You gon' wear that watch, you might as well wear a gun
When you come around real gangsters, you don't front
Unless life is a luxury that you don't want
The long gat, the stocking cap, serious
As a heart attack like Redd Foxx puttin on the act
Couple more reps, let the muscles flex
Damn you gettin big 'Bis, they don't love you yet?
I'm as smooth as smooth can get
I shake your hand to bruise your neck to improve your breath
Hang with rappers, actors and descendant masters
Puffin on hash and defendin the classics
I got hip-hop in my blood, I'm blessed
Outside the bones but inside the flesh
They better film this shit, cause I'm 'bout to blaze you
And get it on tape too, I'm 'bout to Kay Slay you
Somebody gon' grab you, try to escape
Hold you down while I perform capouetta on your face
Why you sound like that? Why you tear the mic down like that?
Why you sound so intense when you rap?
The airborne assault you can't call off, breathe exhaust
Like a horse or a supercharged Mustang Ford
Good God niggas is weak, I got real power
Y'all rap for minutes, I rap for hours
Now I only got a couple more bars to pounce ya
Over the counter drugs, Canibus all in ya mouth son
I wish this was a battle, I'd grab the mic
And do curls and destroy you in front of the world
Besides Corey Gunz, ain't shit hot since I been gone

This nigga's past it, 
my clique is massive
And fuck spitting acid if I haven't written classics
Steady repping the West, while Cali rappers say that's played out
You niggas' spaced out
Type of niggas we leave laid out, throwing up a dub
Stomping your face out, that's for the life that you ain't 'bout
You niggas' marks like Zuckerberg and Sanchez
Listenin' to every fuckin' word that a fan says
I think you boys' soft
I think a real fan wanna hear that real shit, if not, turn my voice off
It's Crooked

You are now consumed by the dark side
So welcome to the belly of the beast
All my niggas eat MC's up for lunchtime
And we'll never be ready for the peace
This is for all y'all bitch-ass snitch niggas
That front and always tellin' the police
Ain't no place in this world you can run or hide

Call me Spartacus, In this art I'm just a martyr, plus
I hit hard as a car crash with a charter bus
Y'all just anonymous, don't even try to start a fuss
Because I'm large enough to step down, crushing you all to dust
Flaw's the illest and I put that on my daughters cause
I'm hungry, like the effect I get that marijuana does
In this game, you'll be 
So even with Stan Lee fighting Marvin Hagler, you couldn't marvel us
I'm flipping off everyone who scoffed at my shit and tock
Cause I'm a time bomb with a ticking clock, and the shit just stopped
So if I'm pissed or I'm blowing up like a blister pop
It's just Hip Hop is infested with posers like picture app
So you can go on and kick up rocks
I'll bet it all, you couldn't set it off with fireworks hooked to Vivica Fox
See when I hitch I'll split your knot
Cause I'm fucked up and cold like I eat Dippin' Dots topped with a liquor shot

I ain't worried 'bout these small-time rhymers, who?
No imagery and no substance, gimmicky
Young and seein' victories like witnessing Christopher Reeves runnin'
They'll never take number one, these suckers silicone titties
They just look good fakin' and frontin'
They ain't been strugglin', hustlin', pockets with nearly nothin' in 'em
Fuckin' sick and tired, prayin' somethin' was gonna finally give in
Spit 'caine, every 16, raw is on display
They'll stick veins, pick up a CD, put it on and hit play
I'm a think tank, you know what this means, stay out my 'kin way
We shot callin', blockin' your entry, nickname Dikembe
'Bout that time, we drawin' the fuckin' line
Bullshit stops here and y'all on the other side

Plus you're a perv, the facts just emerged
Sensitive data denial
Get shot on YouTube or go viral, so how did they find you?
Concussion after confession, gold fever, old school westerns
In any group I'm the loneliest member
Thoroughbred stallion, Jamaican mountain music they named him
'til they cut his legs off and framed him
Step into that digital vortex
The scorned vet judged by generations that ain't even born yet
Read faster than most talk
Write slower than the aardvark walks and squints with the card sharks
A room full of mad professors who study language forensics
Intradependent on phonetic directions
Quick draw, aggressive, really am I on the offensive?
I'm just a Marlboro man from Memphis
Surrounded by firewalls, strong defenses
On Mars with ice cubes and Natasha Henstridge, Canibus

What you gonna do, how?
Didn't wanna listen when I told you
Now you eating Soybean Tofu and tryna be social
Cold weather index drop, put it in park, stop
They gotta checkpoint every block
Korean car seat head rest, stuffed animals
3 thousand mile traffic that's understandable
Put you in a Shanghai sling cause you be carrying things
Lock you away with PRK Kim
Human nature, animal behavior, they believe in a savior
We were all duct tapped by the taper
Can't wake up and smell roses to heal yourself
You're looking for an opportunity to kill yourself
The undead grabs your leg, kick him in the fucking head
Kick his fucking ass again
The handicapped hunter covered more ground than all the others
We gotta give it to him, that was really something
Out taking a walk Nahanni National Park
Fourteen when I caught my first Goshawk hawk
Now it's time for improvement, 58 wade mount shooters
We sit on the hill and count cougars
We told them about the future none of them cared
Till they went to confiscate his balls, he wasn't there
Peripheral neuropathy, my nerve endings rarely work properly
I can't feel nothing, try stopping me
They do what they do cause they can
They dominate man, every human hominid was scanned
I beg your pardon? I don't know what you talking
Right now from where I'm standing, escape ain't no option
Late August, dry spell
Smoke jumpers jumping outta planes tryna battle fires from Hell
They have the right to blindfold your eyes
Under paragraph five they need you to initial and sign
Transparent policies regarding technologies
Software secure, then again it might not be
The microphone is a Philosopher's Stone with negative and positive poems
Can-I-Bus you probably know him
I make the music, I create it
I don't have to explain it, I don't care if you hate it
It develops slow just like we standing here watching the grass grow
Then some day, out of no where: GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!
What you gonna do now yo?
When MRAPs run over the town folk
I'm not the only one that sees it I'm just bold enough to believe it
Predictive policing, they watch you while you speaking and tweeting for so many reasons, seeing is believing ever since the agreement between the humans and the reptilian species
Before the Garden of Eden that bore Prometheus
The Devil is devious cause he's the greediest
Land lizards below, winged ones above
The crude we depend on is dinosaur blood
This prison is perfect, a vacuum inside these gates
Together we created something that escaped
You sold us all out to this alien intrusion
And you got the fucking nerve to call yourself human?!
Tell 'em why you mad, I ain't mad no more
You don't wanna listen to knowledge then that's on y'all
YOU put material items before God
YOU put the evil leadership in charge
YOU were deceived by their villainous charm
And YOU destroyed the constitution's rule of law
One hundred thousand price per share in a uranium mine
Poor lady looks at her baby and cries
Billions of people, slaves to consumption, destruction
You know that God is disgusted",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-rude-boy-oscars-lyrics

To joke around, not about me, not about my sound
Appear in the clouds as eyes looking down

Fall out flat, land like cats, lets rap
Get back! Nice with his hands
Nice with a newspaper rolled up tight, assault rifle or a knife
24 inch machete, 24 hours to live
Come get me, my THUG Theory deadly
Lyrical Law is tribunal communal court
One juror with six faces, they all talk
At the same time til' the people's minds are distraught

From G.E.D.'s, to degrees, from Ivy League colleges
I politic with any magazine columnist
About topics other emcee's won't even bother with
Rock solid shit like stones and monuments
It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us
Closely, through a microscope and a pair of binoculars
Ghetto scholars like me, who study street calculus
I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet
To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous
The key to knowledge, is guarded by angel locksmiths
Who travel across the Universe, in flying objects
Secrets deadly to man, is dioxin
We sparring with God, our arms are too short to box with
Four thousand years before Christ, in the times of Pharaoh
Welcome to Channel Zero

Yo, dangerous minds, manufacture dangerous rhymes
Signs from revelations predict, perilous times
In the year two-thousand, the planets will be in alignment
Only the wisest, will survive it
The Earth will experience, a sudden change in climate
Killing many organisms in our environment
The earthquakes destined to happen in California
Will trigger the Brevard Fault in Atlanta, Georgia
The collapse of roads, bridges, and buildings
The death, of millions of innocent civilians
The Freemasons will control the nation
But you don't hear me though, it's the information",https://genius.com/Canibus-channel-zero-original-version-lyrics
2017 Canibus Features Update,UnKnown,2017,"First song, ""Lyrics Still Matter"" -- with Chino XL and Phoenix

(First Verse: Chino XL to be transcribed)
(2nd verse: Phoenix)


(In Jamaican accent)
Bobo Bell
Anika L
Both rose and both fell
(End Jamaican accent)
Seven billion created from one cell
Viva la vida in your heaven or your hell
As we fold the untold tales behind the veil
Giant crystal peelers
Coughed out of the vertebrae of the Great Lizard
The Wizard of Writtens has no limits
A simple man constipated with evil
Yet every day I keep it at bay
Surrounded by incontinent people
I create hip hop standards for linguistic mechanics
I land this I stand to position my campus then vomit language
Catatonic Canibus I'm a Tyrannosaurus
Cut my teeth on granite gnawin' the planet
Cold fire freezin' deep voice demon breathin' helium
Close encounter ingredient with no medium
Blood is a funky cologne
With the viscosity of spongey bone
A hive mind inside honeycomb
Gate box hologram
Play Keys of Solo-man
If lyrics don't matter what you rhymin for fam?
Behavior biometrics fame recognitions medics
Forget it, comedic homedics with human aesthetics
A Frankenstein false flag
Experiment gone bad
A lobster boss jerkin off with his claw hand
The pinball machine sound effect singing songs
To ward off war with  and Prince Bandor
Breakdance beatbox modern day Enoch
I swear lyrics still matter it's the key to the lock
Heretic Heretic hematoma hemorrhage
Triple in velamen they lock downside the tenement
Never let him in
I'm Marval comic demonic ultrasonic blue beam bionic
Way above your pay grade -- Just bein' honest
You're motherfuckin right my lyrics still matter
It's the greatest citadel ever built by a rapper!
(Chino XL) Lyrics Still Matter
(Phoenix)  Lyrics Still Matter'
(Canibus) Lyrics still matter
The 9th Wonder of the World built by REAL rappers!


(Canibus' 1st verse)
They preach this, they preach that, fuck the feedback
We under the same banner called rap
Divided way out of alignment
Truth is not one-sided
But who can argue with silence
They preach this, they preach that, fuck the feedback
We under the same banner called rap
Sample: ""I'm a dangerous man to know""
(Canibus' 2nd verse)
Yo, do yourself a favor
Try to rap while you shave a
Calvary saber sharp as razors
From your tent to your trachea
You just a citizen slave
Chasin' folk at Ellie Shadow through a cave
Laid in a Peruvian grave
Attack like swarms of drones
With chromed out terminator bones
That's why Logan won't leave me alone
He backtracked it to the territory of a fisher cat
Picture that
Twisted himself into a terrific trap
You only got fans on the internet
You a rap vet with IBS
And the shit ain't even hit em yet
You might as well rape your mother
It's too late for you to be rediscovered
You never know I might be your cousin
The one who had to discipline you
Because you wasn't original
True victory is not visible without peripheral
Who made all those albums, and wrote all those songs
A whole career and never put nobody on?
NEXT SONG
Pre-intro:
Robaholic: ""Yo this is Robaholic""
Zinko: ""Yo this is Zinko""
Robaholic: ""First off we have to thank you for being willing to work with us. It is an honor to work with such a rapper like you. Our group's name is ""Anchantorlu"" -- in English it means Safe Landing and in Asian it's pronounced ""An chan tor lu. ...Peace!""

Yo this is Can I Bus rhyming from Miami to Peking Island
The original Beast of the East with the great Kool G Rap
East Coast/West Coast international worldwide
Standing in solidarity for safe landings everywhere
Let's go get 'em Zinko!


NEXT SONG - The Heat Is On (?)

Bro Bro Bro Brooklyn might have changed
But the possee the same
We maintain, and we still the strongest link in the chain
We don't wanna clap, God
We don't wanna applaud
We want bars for the wall
Without that you a fraud
Patience still stragulation
Boom bap bass to keep the pace
Sittin in a 60 Studebaker
Betta test Buddha for paper chasin'
Our generation was the greatest
We made mistakes but you gotta face it
I was young, blind, deaf, dumb, naked
They caught me with the hardware dropped the case
I was  proof anti grease the juice
Storm troops, move!


It's been a long time comin'
Can I Bus and MF Doom
They been waitin' for this
Yeah, chase comin' soon

MF Doom My cell mate
Tombstone paint
Wait for the Adelphia Freedom Bell and jail break
Chase nah, I overtake you tailgate
How does carbon monoxide taste snail face?
Crustacians in deep water ocean plates
The great  pearl Serbian noose
Iberian scourge 2 second before you dive off a curb
I was singing in a choir in church
Too fast radio burst
The Earl Grey tea gives off steam
Distorted shadows are seen
Through the stargate humanity screams
Can't distinguish between they wants they needs
Noble or immature deeds
It's no wonder why they'll never be free
Let's take a jump back through the mysteries
Designated by the  semantics
Theocratic gymnastics
Turn the page to the next passage
And continue on about the Secret Society and their magic
""It was a manageable church man  Serpent force""",https://genius.com/Canibus-2017-canibus-features-update-lyrics
Worthlessness Purpose,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"He is the Sea Merchant who eats Sea Urchins and Sea Serpents
He does it to give his obvious worthlessness purpose
Deep Sea searches bring his verses back up to the surface
Someone is brought in to interpret
Do not engage in conjectural with the professor
Just nod ya head and say Yes Sir! Here is the next verse
Toxicology analysis, MCs examine Bis but it's too late...
Nothing above ground will escape
The jungle will haunt you, the desert becomes you
Be humble, if it ever takes something from you
No advantage, No standard
Ya Tranquility is being tampered with by Canibus' masterpiece mantra
When albums are requested, they used to be respected
Only the best deserve to be the center of attention
Enter the legend, Hip Hop will never forget him
And Laser Weapons are now being tested
Inside this bubble composed of two poles
I think I can come up with a few flows, bullshit
Says whose knows, just another boy from the Group Home
Who's good at producing a few poems
I wonder how many MCs lives I've touched?
How many lives that I've protected them from?
More powerful public speaker low budget demeanor
Look like the reaper, senior Ripper information retriever
Slick talk or barter away your OES Charter
Not smarter, just thinking harder, it's truly an honor
Plutocracy, Kleptocracy, to be or not to be?
Please talk to me, I'll show you how these rhymes ought to be
There is not much time to decide or take sides
You are standing in the middle of lyrical fratricide
Giant tiger mosquitoes and carrion beetles biting people
The Mist makes it hard to see through
It has always been believed by those even wiser than me
That nobody can describe what I see
Reality hangs in the balance
The ""C"" of Tranquility is not a body of water it's an Island
A string of islands that connect like strings on a violin
Waking up to a dark horizon
My rap style will always be in its prime
You rhyme for yourself, I rhyme for mankind!
Wireless or landline? Any time
Grab the mic and do the damn rhyme
Any time. Grab the mic and do the damn rhyme",https://genius.com/Canibus-worthlessness-purpose-lyrics

100 Bar Beast,Lyrical Law (Special Edition),2015,"Javelins hawk within striking distance
Alert to the sounds we hear, the rapid response verses in the air
I smell the tobacco, we know that you're here
So does the white tail buck and the black bears
What the fuck gave you the right?
To come into the wilderness just to pick a fight?
Whatever jurisdiction you from we rip mics
The B-line of blood trail in the dim light
Back to the kill site
Come here city boy, I hear you're real nice
Surrounded by dark so far from the city lights
Stop browsing, sniff downwind cowards
You pissed yourself, you smell more foul than public housing
Hardcore, parkour, tear off your car doors
Fire-breathing gargoyles, eating hyenas, charbroiled
Alien tongues long sharp but called predator claws
I rip through the Kevlar for your heart
'Till your lower body support lost
The large carnivore Spitboss Beowulf rip your torsos off
Float like the flying Albatross, part Mothman part wasp
Ambush armour transport to the marsh
Javelin Fangz, Germaine's bombing raid campaign
My hands change when I drink Beowulf bane
You ain't seen nothing nearly as strange
Blurry as alien planes, still in the frame but nearly out of range
Canines, Sons of Cain, impervious to pain
Numb off cocaine, ripping railroad tracks off trains
Deranged batshit insane, rhymes liquefy brains
Daydreaming of rain, smoke haze and stargaze
AKs spray photon rage, Sharpshooter sharp fangs
Heart pumpin' napalm through coarse veins
Speak to barmaids, breath reeks of Grand Marnier
She says, ""come on behave"", I remove my dark shades
Eyes buried behind wrinkles like Shar Peis
I got a scarface from back in my dog days
The posttraumatic microphone mechanic
Leave the habitat damaged when I rat-a-tat that ratchet
You fucking with the Sharpshooter Masters
*beat change*

When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine
In the beginning I made lyrics, now lyrics make me
You’re listening to Rip The Jacker II: Infinity
This rhyme can outlive your whole lifetime
Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive
Surround you with a layer to the left, to the right
To the front to the back, with a rap and a mic
For satellite rappers delight, you battle for your life
You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight
The cedar wood burns, my heating is rightfully earned
I take you on a journey through the words
In the mind, hold your hand with an infinite rhyme
For a time I know it makes you shy, but that’s fine
Come along with me, let me show you how hard it can be
To spit like the 100 Bar Beast
An extra large dosage of the dopeness
How can I be anything but focused as the spitbar soldier
The rhyme equity above quota
Sometimes I go over with more bars than the beat goes for
Walk around confused, listening to tunes
Music is my muse, Can-I-Bus this abuse?
Put blades to your bones like the Autobiography of Kirk Jones
Nah, I just work for him
I will be redeemed for the destruction of the Hip Hop regime
For how it was remembered and seen
Mission requires a plan, armed personnel and staff
But tradition demands I be a more primitive man
Three standard 16s; fade the record at 3:35
Grim reaper axe, kick to your spine
Pound after pound, I come stomp on your brain
Spit fire like I drink hot sauce from a drain

When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine

When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
That’s when you know your times up Germaine
Don’t forget you nice, you fit the right archetype

Artifacts Freestyle,UnKnown,1997,"If I'm hawking you it ain't because I respect you god
Its because im trying to find a perfect place for me to shit on
Niggas hear about me and discreetly set up a date to me
To see if they can defeat me
So I ain't ready to let no motherfucker eat me
That's why you find little pieces of MCs in my feces weekly
You can't beat me you can't control+alt+delete me
N*gga you can't even shine on a song that features me
Slippery saliva keeps my delivery tighter
Enabling me to outmanoeuvre Russian Mig Fighters
Launching missiles on whack rap artists like they was targets
For coming on broader market with that garbage
From downtown Newark to South Orange, niggas is paying homage
I'll battle you for anything you own worth pawnin'
Raps that snap at your ass crack like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with my tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
From the 'How Can I Be Down?' conference to the Gavin
Whack emcees get slapped in their faces for rapping
For absolutely no Rhyme + Reason I start beefing
Spitting words faster than two Puerto Ricans speaking
Keys for me to make an example out of somebody you respect
And that you will discourage you from trying to test
Whoever ain't nice enough to rhyme wit me
Should surrender their soul and combine with me
Or die violently, I try to be a millionaire before the year's up
I'm hungry like a dog with his ears up
This little nigga with heart from north Newark
The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of the great white shark, I'll rip you apart
My state of the art lyrically laser is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet projectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of the cranial cavity
Is what actually what happens for anything motherfucker for trying to battle me
90 minutes of heat, 90 minutes of lyrics and beats, 90 minutes and these brick city streets
Mad ball and tab one keeping it tight

The Golden Cypher,Lyrical Law,2011,"Rap so klepto, any mic I steal
Y'all niggas don't belong here like Michael Steele
At a Republican Party, I go for {?}
Leave cum stains on Sarah Palin's veneers for sure
Like I'm in Mordor, tryin to burn the ring up
The black semi knock your block off like playin Jenga
Have sex with the whole world just by raisin my middle finger
But y'all don't hear me though, +Inga+
And just like that I'm back spittin nasty as +Foxy+
Then I'ma stop servin y'all like the soup nazi
Happy Days, then I'ma spin off like +Joanie Loves Chachi+
Burn rubber, the Maserati mach three
Screamin mazeltov at my aki
Squad vomit at Keith Shocklee for the beat made of broccoli
Got a Palestinian girl, her pussy the bomb
Get it? Blew up, you can't stop me

That's right, I wreck melody, so much energy
Why get on the track if you can't stand next to me
So much energy it's a felony
Ya microphone memory remember me, this is your penalty
You can't keep up mentally, you can't rhyme intelligently
Do it on the track, can't do it in front of me
You fronting, you and your man get all psyched up like it's Fight Club
Times up, you lost, life sucks
So does your wife slut, got a nice cunt
Last night we wiped white stuff on her butt
True power cannot be achieved by fighting over the mic
You can't compete with Canibus, aight
If your hat's turned to the back and you rap, be prepared to scrap
You don't have to be scared of no strap
Cos your mind overstand all that
Fall back or no more contact with the gods of Rap
Go back to the Lyrical Law lab, first of all you trash
You can't add all the rhymes you had
Your mouth is a wound and your tongue is a scab
This is a concept the young mind doesn't grasp
That old stick in the mud will put a gold bullet in the gun
Show you where red blood comes from
But that's not what you want, you want love
Where does that come from, define that you bum
One thing at a time, intertwined as one mind
The proto in the prime of one perpetual line
No evil one I can divide, no matter the times, try
No matter the lies that claim otherwise
Slumdog drug lord, guns drawn, motherfuck guns laws
Catch a big minigun gun charge
This is Lyrical Law. not lyrical war
This is spiritual god, get your lyrics, get your lyrics...

I'm nice with everything but chopsticks
Eyes couldn't see my style with glasses or binoculars made of optics
Stop it, slam it, rappers couldn't scoop a topic
Let alone follow they finger to mock this
Caught your hand on my style kid, put it in your pocket
If you can't get it home, what the fuck is the logic?
Want my devices, send my boys in to send fire to the ground
Hang my flag and brag, who's the nicest?
My Fort Knox, like Bunker Hill, {?} emcees guerrillas
Rhymin to go banana, breaks performed by Mad Drill
Man chill, your man'll get killed
And when they dump his ass off they gon' find him in a landfill
If I have to I will, that's on the real
I'm +Destiny's+ only +Child+ of the pay, on these girl group ""Bills""

Monkey face I'll monkey flip you
I always wanted to diss you
You ugly as a pit bull motherfucker, I'll rip you
This is where the Broad St. bullyin' stops
My bars of gold bullyin' yours are not
Truth is I never thought your metaphors were hot
You just talk a lot a shit cause you're on the Roc'
There's no proof in your ''Truth'' it was a flop
That's why Jigga signed Cam'ron to take your spot
You think you hot cuz you got a little bling or what not
A typical hustler all you do is think about rocks
With a budget like yours you should a sold more
You probably think you recouped nigga you're so wrong
I think Jay fucked you go look at your deal
In that black mink you look like a ape for real
If I was blind and I couldn't tell
I'll probably still hear it from a bitch that you ugly as hell
For starters the Bentley ain't yours it's Shawn Carter's
And if it ain't Shawn's, it's his partners
You're just another novice artist with frog lips
On the Roc-A-Fella roster that follows orders, nigga!
You tryin' too much you lyin' to sluts
You too hyped up, spend some more time in the cut
I'll turn my voice up loud so I can tell you wassup
Rhyme for rhyme you was never ready for 'Bus
Your quotables are anecdotal
Your whole crew's softer than tofu
Most of y'all don't even know the ''Truth''
If you did then you knew I was a soldier too
Doing what you already sold your souls to do
I'm doing shows and my wrist stays frozen too
But I own my shit who owns you?
I should sign to the Roc'
Battle you in the lobby of Worldwide Plaza make you resign on the spot
Give me that mic' back Mack Bitch you can't spit
I don't even know why the fuck Jigga passed you that shit
I'll embarrass you with that shit, blast you that quick
Wrap you in plastic and toe-tag you as a Jacker

Who's the first to kill, the first with steel
The first time I spit I knocked the Earth upon its axis tilt

The skills nigga~! Take it back to the essence of this shit man
Let motherfuckers see what you can REALLY do

I'll give you one clue to guess what my rap gun do
Like kung-fu, I got a steel pallet I practice runnin my tongue through
Ninety extra inches my lung grew, I stun you
And when I'm done a paraplegic'll outrun you
You want head trauma, real soon I'ma promise I'ma
Drop seeds that blow up like the the Unabomber's momma
Y'all know what happens when a rapper starts yappin
I'll be bionic orangutan hand back stabbin
I break light speed surge and illustrate verbs
His career was so short his bio was eight words
See I'm admittin the sentence was well written
Except THIS motherfucker should have never started spittin!
I'm too triflin to let him life again
I'm stiflin pain permanently by feeding you nitrogen Vicodin
See some of the worst speakers that I know
Could vegetablise your flow like pico de gallo
Boy you got a lot of balls, playin with a dude
That can telekinetically extract bricks out of walls
If you come in my zone dissin my curriculum
I chew your ass out like the flavor in a stick of gum

The linguistic league bitches, cutthroat, smeared lipstick
Wrists slit and I suggest you keep the {??}? dissin before
You wake up in a tub to only find your ogans missin
Make sure to leave your tongue, with hopes you continue spittin
Dickridin, label providin, your fraudulent image
You the type of silly hoe to have no sense to begin with
Listen hooker emcees, on a mission of death, last breath
Your final rest, baby who got next?
I pop your lungs from your chest cavity
You consider your amateur blow to be challenging well then battle me!
I'll be waiting six feet, beneath the sheets of your thesaurus
Deep defeat, crack your teeth, no AutoTune on my chorus
Distorted your image, while drownin all your hopes and wishes
Revenge is served cold on a set of dirty dishes
Snitches, yeah, haven't you heard?
I'll put my barrel in your mouth and show you what a women's worth

This is the definitive guide, on beats and rhymes
On how to get a black eye fuckin with those black guys
You better listen to what I'm sayin and teach yourself
Or I'll give you a belt and watch you beat yourself
Told you don't make a sound if you do they will put you down
Then all I'ma say is look at you now
Hip-Hop was not based off risk on a primal level
We rhymin with you, not rhymin at you
You better understand this shit or get talked to in Arabic
Banana clip, you don't wanna talk to Canibus
You talk about bars, my upper torso crawl up the wall
In your house through your window boy
Burglar bars get ripped off, bite off your arm
Leave +Jigsaw+ scars, that's just a doll
This is Thunderdome hall, decoded like Sean
The laser beam scan the apartment, it's gone
Metaphorical wizard, the Oracle visit every four minutes
Until I finish, you bring me more Guiness
I'm like Devin the Dude, and Mexican food
With some Mexican dude and some gunslingers too
Come through, call the airstrike on your hood
Evacuate every bitch that make love so good
So what you wan' do? E'rybody chillin, we cool
Don't have to rip the face off no fool
That ain't ""Lyrical Law"" that's a lyrical rule
I ain't did this before, I don't wanna be cruel
I just wanna be loved, but the world wants blood
So we barricade the doors and wait for the noise
Nature boy, my name is deployed, the cave is destroyed
If you mention his name, he gets annoyed
Cause boys should not play with psychotic toys
A boy should not talk with a psychotic voice
Stand before me, don't plead no case
Cause you passed ""Lyrical Law"", you already great
So take your place next to any emcee that's great
In the Most High's name we pray

While erasin' the lost dynasty of Beijing
Spittin' rhymes cause significant mission lapse time
You'll be fine, don't rewind; move onto the next line
Three bogies 10 o'clock high, I die if I do not try
Ostriches are not supposed to fly
Fighter pilots with no eyelids
Did you see what I just did?
Hydraulic pressure gettin' as high as a bitch
Textbook vertical spin, landed on the wing, I'm in
The evil bald Eagle strike you again
Yuri Gagarin, I met him when we he came to Heaven
My first guest from terra firma Passage Magellan
I didn't hesitate to tell him, 2012 you police yourselves
As Earth travels through the gravity belt
And I can offer you no help
The Period of Purification can be described as somethin' you call Hell
Yeah, S-P-E-L-L, R-A-P-E-L down to W-E-L-L
Wolfgang countdown!

Start at your head, I end it quick and end your ass
Send your career on a collision course; then you'll crash
I'mma laugh mothafucker, its gon' only get worse
You'll hit a tree and you go flyin' through your window headfirst
Foes come in the white mink, leave in the red fur
Get your fuckin' ass kicked, leave with your head hurt
Beef with me equals dead thugs
Even when I'm fuckin' sleep, stomp out you bedbugs
The Hitman buck quick
One thing I can't stand in this rap game is a bitch ass who suck dick
Rap too good for the hood, who's the don
And they said I'd never make it without help from you know who
But I proved them wrong
Even without money in my pocket I still move along
And I'm happy Canibus got me to do this song
I was never assed out; my label's the only label
And the mothafuckin' world is able to take the trash out
Call me sweet, Big Kevin I fuck a bitch 'til she pass out
I got hands too when I cum, a lot of niggas don't wanna back out
Dirty niggas, they gon' pull a mac out
Cause I rap grapple and box, make competition tap out
I put it down; I cut them down, cut them down
You know I'm known to shut them down
Dudes is jokin', I laugh, take cash cause they clowns
If they got beef with that I get Canibus to spray the rounds
Take them down; I'm the Godfather, Long Island music here to take the crown
Breeze through, enemies quiet, they don't make a sound
Get a bucket of red blood, paint the town
I'm a beast, when I walk I shake the ground
Who hatin' now? Who hatin' now? Who hatin' now?",https://genius.com/Canibus-there-has-he-been-lyrics

Jesus Christ, my name should be Jeebus Mic
Even when I rip the shit, fans leave uptight
Can-I-Bus, spit is in my blood, I'm blessed
Outside the bones but inside the flesh
And yes, if I was focused I could crush you
Cause you sayin you focused, now how come I can still touch you?
I bust you, then spit some Young Buck shit at you
Cause I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two
The perfect music machine, mechanical being
The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen
I did, I do, I does, I am
I will be, I was the same nigga you love
But slugs rain from the sky, it's like the angels want me to die
They push me harder cause they want me to try
A pitbull off the leash, barkin speech
Like a bull in the pit, liftin you off your feet
I feel like the world's mine, I can park in the street
Kick the world's illest rhyme, police officers weep
People layin on the concrete exhausted from heat
Watchin John Kerry spit over some Michael Moore beats
This is a little somethin that my repertoire boast
I almost was in control of all coasts
I give the fans rhymes to quote, they all dope
Total lyrical landslide, give me all votes
But I can be as quiet as they want me to be
Cause even though they say my name, they ain't talkin to me
They talk to magazines, they talk to MTV
They up on 106 on BET talkin to Free
Big niggas actin tough, but they walk like they ankles is cuffed
Who gives a FUCK if your ankles is buff
I can ar-ticulate, I wanna par-ticipate
But they tryin to hold me back with black ball number eight
I pick the microphone up and spark the debate
Ever since ninety-eight I been a target for hate
Jesus Christ! My name should be JeeBus Mic
Even when I rip the shit, fans leave uptight
Fuck it, I'm in the middle of little Italy
With a middleman that didn't know diddly so I killed him lyrically
The Big Pun, energy enters me strengthens me
Lay you on the floor, shoot you in the back, make you Centipede
My sense of speed is ten over three
MC times Kay Slay over the motherfuckin MP
My fanbase sit and wait for the comin
They couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug 'em

Patriots (Original),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I go to war
I keep it raw
I go hard
I go to war
I spar
I keep it raw
I go hard

I make your weak crew release stools
I put a pistol in your mouth and pull then I feed you to the pit bulls
Don't even talk about guns
The only 9 you got is a $5 bill and 4 ones
So I don't give a fuck what none of y'all niggas say
‘Cause anything that can't penetrate ricochets
Rhyming with me on a record?
You might as well have died and went to Hell instead of Heaven
‘Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method
Your four limbs tied to four horses all pulling in different directions
In this profession I get busy without a question
Seeing me is like seeing a vampire's reflection
Fast and slow flows connect like electrodes
I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck mode
Explode, leaving areas abandoned
With more radiation behind than spots UFOs landed in

I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them

I go hard

Can-I-Bust, I bust off before the coin toss
Then I rip your loin cloth off, look how small your genitals are
You got a Napoleon complex, barber shop gossip
Says you used to grab ya ankels in jail for all the convicts
Lap dancing quadraceps
As fruity as a pina colada on a tropical island in the Bahamas
Trying to win a bikini contest
Them skeletons in ya closet got flesh on them and they smell rotten
Trying to battle is like standing on a launch pad
In Cape Canaveral with me in the astronaut capsule
Ready to blast you on a journey to space
Ready to turn your whole face into sirloin steak
Comparable to questions in Bible
How is it possible that the model ship fit in the neck of a bottle
A congo in this concrete jungle, pull out your tonsils
And stomp you into the earth like fossils

I go to war.... with the best of them
I spar....... with the best of them
I keep it raw.... with the best of them

I'm the meanest motherfucker on this whole Navy Seal team
And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes
Calling all bitch-ass niggas and bitch-ass bitches
I got a Howitzer bigger than any 4/5th is
Rapping is a raw business
But as an individual I'm as different as anybody's fingerprint is
If boring is the norm, I'm the antonym
Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in
Bugging like a satanic evangelist
Jogging butt-naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles
Every MC in your crew will get ruined or wounded
You talk the bullshit and you too scared to do shit
I'm the type of nigga that will prove it, produce shit
Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in
A soldier who practices West Indian Obeah
I can drink the poison from a king cobra
‘Cause long after y'all are dead and gone
I'll survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod
Is it all soldier

Is there anything you need

For those that can't see him, they lost man leave 'em
Transparent transceiver, no hand lever
On the hand receiver, the signal gets weaker
Cells excrete polymer gels that form hardened shells
That repel interrogative drills in the torture cell
Sounds like Hell, not exactly
Rap for me, this human's cavity interacts with me
Blood, liver, and lungs, external viscera thugs
Cutting me up with glitter covered gloves
I ran out the building, ran to the building where I parked
Why are my children not in the car?
I am not unraveling, I am calm
I'm staying at Bigelow Arkansas obeying the law, playing GRAW
They ask questions with Russian like aggression
From the on screen projector, what is your intention?
Moratorium? I got four of them, meet me in the auditorium
I'mma show you how to talk to them
Right handed MC, used to be lefty
Wind direction don't affect me, my spotter corrects me
Open the eyelid, check behind him like crazy Ivan
On the coastliner, Psilocybin, crazy rhyming
With third Density binding, galactic plane timing
The Pleistocene is rising, I cannot describe it
Lavatory tidy and quaint, brand new paint
Laboratory, huge, sprawling, brand new warheads
Space grunts line up face front
Base jump into the waste dump, complete Phase one
Bone shards scattered all over the bone-yard
We low crawl paying no attention to our nose at all
I see the beast, pupil size increase
Seen it grab somebody off the street, bite and release
I decrease my silhouette, try to lay flat
Zero in where the chest and the neck intersect
Take a breath than hold it, but only for a moment
Stay focused or your first one will be your last, soldier
Woke up in the Infirmary, here's your papers
Thank you for your service, young man, see you later
Cardboard paper signs say:
""Will eat rhymes three times a day if you could only spare me a dime""
Real Hip Hop spitting, that's how I'm livin'
I mount my weapon like I mount my women
Intercept correct beats, sleep, search, collect, and keep
I like it, let's meet next week
The mind of a weirdo, it's not really clear where he goes
Nobody here really knows
Everybody wanna ask questions

Title 17 USMC,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"I'm in a meeting with the Surgeon General of written texts
The battery of 1,000 psychological tests
I am exhausted and stressed but I continue to press
She asked me if I'm the best, I signed languaged back, ""Yes""
Spell words wrong when writing down rhymes nowadays
My hairs are beginning to grey, that's why I'ma shave
The sky dark purple, low crawl through the wormhole
Took me back to 1998 at Universal
In 2008 I'm eternal
You know I'm still nice with the verbals and I ain't even heard you
Your views, your virtues
What you gonna do when Martial Law curfew lock down your Rock Band Rehearsal
Got ground zero asthma cancer
Buried on the Moon as the top Hip Hop Commander
After talking to 
Paul Laffoley
, he spoke about perigee and apogee
Something that I understood naturally
The mindscape, the other atmosphere is my space
But in my case, I seem trapped by the rhymes that I make
Canibus code for a data tabulated below
It's the end of the world you know, glad you made it to the show
According to Title 17 USC
Section 107, Canibus is just an MC
I'm a Reggaeton rap translated from Jamaica
You a hater with that white boy hodgy behavior
You could say what you say, but my catalogue greater
Everything you heard before with more layers
Poet Laureate V, why didn't they accept me?
If I remember correctly, lets see
The ""C"" of Tranquility, 
the mind will ascend
The audio will blend into multiples of 10
The lies we have been told really are the truth
So together we will all learn again what we knew
Proud to have come so far, spit another bar
The carousel issue continues to revolve unresolved
Take my hand Ripper Grand Wizard chain of command
Take this torch to another land, tell them who I am
The riot squad robot look like Robocop photoshopped
Heckler and Koch, semi-auto stock
I speak into the mic, leaves fall off the Tree of Life
But next fall I'ma see if you nice",https://genius.com/Canibus-title-17-usmc-lyrics

Wake up every morning, yo I must succeed uh
Nationwide ruckus, make the word stampede uh
Show with me, make we roll some weed uh
Mad charge nigga, now I must proceed uh

Ey yo, I had to make this beat available offline
Just in case the power goes out in the middle of my rhyme
Improvising, improving, maximizing my ability to do this
Pullin' strings even when my mouth's not moving
The black cat that's stoopin' on the love boat film or action movies
You want to hate boat troll? Then active coofy
The intellectual thinker is attracted to me
Rollin' up Scooby snack doobies, take two puffs and pass it to me
Sittin' in the back of a jacked up tailgate
I know my bitch look young, but she ain't jailbait
Copenhagen's known for fake, she kinda like how it taste
That's why she all up in my face
Speakerbox boomin' all up in that *place*
Codename 308s, Can-I-Bus that *great?*
Holdin' hands, singin' kumbaya, it's too late
They say a racial war coming, go paint your face
Ripper verse psychology curse, statue even during apologies
Are you not entertained? Then follow me
Cody wasn't for hire, brief fabricated slam fire
Silver rounds for the vampires

Wake up every morning, yo I must succeed uh
Nationwide ruckus, make the word stampede uh
Show with me, make we roll some weed uh
Mad charge nigga, now I must proceed uh

Now let's stay on topic, let's talk about it
My product and my latest Hip-Hop project, CBD vaporizers
Gold plated Olmec face, they come with a golden neck brace
Senior technician, 401K
Activate, smash your face with the trey eight strapped around the waist
Then dump you in a dilapidated place
Beat 'em down with aluminum, then I put two in 'em
The harlem world hooligan with a bad boy pseudonym
Throw you off a highrise, see if you can skydive
They fear me like cavlike(?) tile, black child
Go surgical, chop it up vertical
Bars from my notebook murder you
Can you say ""testicular turpitude""?
'Course you can't! Tongue twister metaphors put you in a trance
In that sunken place doing the drunken dance
Wake up, upside down hung by the pants
M-m-monster truck transmission, crush your hands
Body blows to the guts, stomach cramps, tough man
I'm a sheepdog covered by the blood of the lamb
Im hot, my hands are warm, my mind is cold
Together they strum notes on the strings of your soul
I was there when they put Hip-Hop under arrest
When the artificial intelligence took its first breath
The Boston Dynamics mechanics scoured the planet for antediluvian amulets buried in Atlantis
The haters just talk shit cuz if I ever break loose they panic
They don't know I got brain damage

Aiyo I'm so updated niggas get frustrated
I'm the best that you ever heard, nigga fuck your favorite
Fuck a public statement, I'ma say it right here
It's quite clear, I'm the nicest anywhere
You paranoid, what's the reason for that?
Scared in the barbershop chair, with heat in your lap
I drag you out in the desert, freeze you in fact
Pulp trees run out of paper, roll leaf with the map
It's like that, give me dap, Cani-Beezy is back
I'ma take 40 million this season in rap
Take small change as long as I can afford range
When I'm flying overseas, I can't take no small planes
If the course change, I'll be in the cockpit
With the Glock cocked, looking at the pilot all strange
Jason Germaine, born Williams is a false name
U.S. military trained, remember one thing
I remember was no other soldier like me
My M-4 carbine bang nightly
Hand combat Tai Chi, fight me
I'm Sagittarius, so I don't like Pisces
Affect you with the mic disease, try to breathe
Airborne spores reach overseas with light breeze
Out in Waikiki with ki's and G's
On a hammock with my trees like, what you need?
Got shorties in tight jeans over there, this is what life means
She suck me off, then she take me sightseeing
Spending per diem with a real nicely tanned Korean
She and her friend, they drive a little BM
Picked me up at 10PM, took me to the VM
Cause I was already kinda leaning off the Seagram's
I'm feeling weak, blame it on the herb rush
Yo that's Kay Slay banging Lloyd Banks? Turn it up
I got a track after this one, I burnt it up
Big Shaq, Money Mark, Canibus, you heard of us
I give you rhyme surplus, words deluxe
Manufactured the 'Bus, just observe me once
I'm the bright light before you, the first of one
Kay Slay brought me back cause they worshipped sun
The cursed one, my hip-hop heartbeat thump
Who that punk talking junk, I'll punch the chump
Badunkadunk, like Lil' Jon on crunk
Have wonton for lunch with Brazilian fudge
Toss a rock my way, and I'll probably throw a million slugs

I know you can't commit but at least try a sample
Who knows, I might be too much man to handle
If I'm attracted to you, I'mma make a long pass at you
Come after you and capture you
Put a platinum GPS bangle around ya ankle
To keep track of you incase I decide to marry you
We can be friends till death do us part
Kiss ya left breast cuz it's next to ya heart
Don't be a mermaid, open up ya legs
If you can't spread eagle, just gimme some head
Whatever the outcome, I just wanna cum
Beat it up real good, bust one and run
I believe in abstinence, just not tonight
I can't help myself you look hot tonight

Clitoris rubbin, sperm pumpin, nerve numbin, humpin in public
The whole world could probably hear you cummin
The way I grab your pumpkin, caress your dumplings
I ain't never leave me girl, so stop frontin
You never wanted a Yes man, you wanted and Arabesque man
With biceps and a chest imprint
Not a skeleton with hardly any skin
I know it's irrelevant but his penis is probably very thin
I'm hung like the trunk of an elephant
Or the trunk of the tree the serpent wrapped around in Genesis
With the same devilish malevolence
Tryin to get you to bite in the food, I injected with seditives
How many orgasms have you had already?
Let's have a shag-a-thon; tell me when you past twenty
When I introduce you to Grand Marye, act friendly
She'll get envious if I ever rub your ass gently
Tonight I'm being a pimp baby, not an emcee
Invite a couple friends, I'll reserve ten seats
After we eat, we can check a couple spots tonight

Yale University Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's the phantom of the opera, the Dracula, Caligula unpopular
Melt your ocular with rocket-thrust processors
I dare you to touch the touch-screen monitors without proper gloves
Melt the skin off your fingers 'till they look like rounded nubs
As retarded as Forrest Gump
You're nothing but a two-pump chump drunk punk with a puss filled prostate lump
You think that skunk stunk
You should have smelled that decomposing cunt that sick gruesome grunt dumped in my trunk
I'm a hunter that's ready to discontinue the hunt
But I'm gonna keep ripping you scum 'till the millennium's done
You couldn't pass if you was gassed out of your ass
I'll battle you in front of Sterling Library after class
You get slumped, spending your tuition on blunts, you're a dunce
You get rejected trying to join Mic-Club
Feces hit the fan from the front
Liquid liters of diarrhea, not mud
No, it's beet juice not blood
Truncate your trunk
Decapitate your face with a gun
Assassin with your tongue
Remove seven-eighths of your lung
Donate it to monks with jumpsuits, zip down in the front
For easy access when they get crunk with the nuns
As peaceful as Evel Knievel using a dirty heroine needle
After a four hundred and eighty foot jump
Perform verbal acrobatic magic with crash-proof tactics
Stuntmen say the F word more than once
Put you on point
P.R.T your funky joint
With proof like nineteen thirty three double eagle coins
'Bring The Noise' like enemies out in public
You know you love it
A genie bottle covered with porcupine follicles try and rub it
Blood drips 'till the tub's flooded
My dead enemies lay there gutted 'till year two thousand and forty something
In the meantime, everybody's outside running
Cos the puppet master behind the curtain is coming
With some hydrochloric stuffed in the luggage
A Final Call newspaper under his arm saying, ""Peace my brothers""
Resonances from my vocal tracks smothers the others
I'll bring sparks to any Bubba, make him guzzle pig blubber
Do a ""Ninja Man"" cover, tell you to suck your mother
If I wanted to get at you I'd just infect your lover
Your girl's an exceptionally good sucker
She ain't got no tan, I'll tap that ass 'till it changes color
Get technical with decibels that are connected to you
The audible is too incredible to sell them to you
I'd rather tuck you in at night and tell them to you
I introduce you to new words and spell them for you
Dropping jewels with unpunctuatingly possible sexigonical chronicles
Burn you up faster than two hundred pounds of fuel
In helicopters doing loops out in Kabul
Compared to me you're a out-turn, a penniless fool
I'll take you to school expose you to the negative news
Take you out for drinks put some sedatives in your booze
If you manage to win I'll kill you, so it's better you lose
But I'll set it up so you win and celebrate it with you
I'll break the truth to you at a quarter to five
Look you square in the eye
And tell you that there's nowhere for you to hide
Triangulate your flow to wherever you rhyme
Quintangulate your fibers one thread at a time
Bare this in mind, look a little deeper you'll find
Line for line, Canibus is the Red Giant of rhymes

They keep trying to front on me, they don't want none of me

You want to be an actress
Why you proud of her
Haven't shit change but the dick sliding in and out of her

How to flow how to (they don't know 'Bis)
How to go how to, how to..
Yo if I cough in my fist when I opened my hand
There'd be dope in my hand cause I spoke in my hand
In the gym 'til I turn the two-pack, to a four
'Til the four got sore and had to make two more
In a whole 'nother state of mind - Mexican standoffs
Waste lives but they save time
You know the danger, the ranger, pantyhose over
Got basic scopes and lasers, my toaster is a widowmaker
Good things come to those that wait
BULLSHIT!  Better things come to those that chase
I sweep the streets with a fleet bigger than the Greeks
'Til we occupy your land like thiefs, we fin' to eat nigga

I'm back for the music, back to do exclusives
Back to change the view of hip-hop, from that bullshit
Back to mash up beats to bang up your ave and streets
Canibus nigga, back with heat (yo)

Aiyyo, hot out the box with Nottz, shots just went off
Nigga better check to see if you caught
Shootouts between rap stars drivin fast cars
Through the hills of Madagascar, we can take it that far
Screwface you niggas; yo who's the real rudeboy rude nigga?
(Not you nigga) You got booed nigga
My close quarter combat not bad
Big niggas drop dead when I stop they air
You just a man, your relationship with oxygen's clear
Canibus rockin with Nottz this year, yeah
Motherfuckers, your back blast area clear
Canibus rockin with Nottz this year, yeah - bring it


Aiyyo a slug to the stomach make a thug move sluggish
Crawlin in his bloodiness no matter how big the gun is
If the fuzz is comin, blast shells by the tonnage
'Til there ain't nothin left but start runnin
I got a message 'bout I got a court summons
Everybody around me wants somethin, they all extort NUTTIN
I was young, I was stupid, I was really too hype
Cause I thought a microphone was really worth my life
Go make a club banger, that's what they asked me to do
You a DUMB NIGGA, who the fuck is askin you?
I write a book for ya, Nottz write a hook for ya
We can both split half of what we took from ya
I'm just a 'round-the-way neighbor in your hood fella
You wan' show love, let's break bud nigga
We control the price of rap fuel
I attacked you cause annual tax was due
Four duellars a gallon, we gon' take it back to two
Hip-Hop nigga, that's what we back to do
For you.. for you.. (that's what we back to do)
For you.. for you.. (that's what we back to do)

...like a pit bull
On full moon, man switch to wolf
Full proof verse from Hell to Turnbridge Wells
You never seen an MC do it this well
Everyday we battle at Saint Germaine's Chapel
But it's practical, I'll smash you and nobody laughs at you
The Ripper rip you up, drag you behind the basilica
They find drugs, lyrics and blood, I hit you up
Lonely heart vocal throwing dart oligarch
Creates art from an upstate New York motor park
And won't get off his high horse to come talk unless it's important
And it could cause a spark, but it's dark so he stays dormant
You don't want it, you just act like it
Your style ain't flawless you just rap like it
I'm level 3-A like Curtis LeMay
The Blackhawk bird of prey with superb taste
I re-inject my blood to give me a buzz
Then I re-inject the buzz, blow out your earplugs
Scrub your eardrums, suck the air out of your lungs
You combust in a vacuum of solar flare from the Sun
I walk through a gestalt of thought to the sound of a harp
From afar playing the notes I was taught
I was caught, shackled, sold, re-bought
Global mind forced to restart, my rhymes skipped forward
The HRH of time and space
And rhymes through the bars, my lines displace
Concentrate, mitigate concrete debate
Great how I create what you hired me to make
Extrapolate, update rap at a rapid rate
Fans hate it ‘cause I can't practice everyday
Numismatic treasure chest stashed in the attic
Spondulix in exchange for the musical magic
With two tablets placed on the cabinet, I wonder who will grab it?
If no one does, I'll have it
Both lobes connected, flow been perfected
Whatever method, select it, let's spit
Incredulous lyrics, the breath of life spreading through the spirit
Hip-Hop never knew what hit it
Stubby beard, chubby skin under the hair
I spent my wonder years carrying nothing but guns and gear
With a focused rap flow, tongue snap like a hybrid bow
My quotes end up inside your throat
Respect for Hip Hop balance the Biosphere
But I've been there before so why go there?
I soar through the air, my clarity so clear
That my Dali Lama prayer give me cauliflower ears

Around the globe there's kids that play the Canibus quotable quiz
Its like if you ain't a mogul they don't know who you is
But I'm a oldie in the biz with the vocals and libs
Said so much crazy shit on my last album
My name shut Interpol down for two hours
Now that's true power
I create what I can't count to rhyme from my anger management counselor
Just listen to the fives and blend in with the signal you getting
Can you hear me now? Answer the question
You wanna talk about sick poems? I spit stones
Leave you split holmes, tied knots with your rib bones
Quick blows break off your limp wrist bones
Make you scream melodies in twelve different ringtones
I can speak Chinese, ching chong get off the ding dong
Knock your ass over the tables like little ping pongs
You got balls? Bring 'em on
I smash 'em with a spiked bat like Raekwon with Cuban Linx on
Blink and you gone, let off more shells than shrimp farms
Spit raw, your face look like you smelling stink bombs
You ain't dreamin nigga, pinch your arm
Canibus be spittin' bars that can dislodge Kanye's jaws

What you lookin' for? We hookin' off
Punchlines on the song through the hook and all
You actin' like you think you too good to fall
You spit with a glass jaw, get up give it more

If I was focused I could crush you
Cause you sayin you focused, then how come I can still touch you?
I bust you, then spit some young buck shit at you
Cause I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two
My little arms carry big arms, to tickle the clip
Finger keep the sig warm when I bring harm
I have a nigga screamin' for his mama
Your body armor don't protect you from your karma
Come along with me, let me see what you got
Battle you on the spot, show you how nice you not
I'm the champ like Ali, you just a close copy
When people see you, they don't know that its not me
I flow cause I got to
This shit sound hot cause its not you
You tried to catch me, but I got you
I got a mind that spins like belt drives
And when I seen hip hop die I felt cries
But I got an idea to bring it back to life
Bring me back to the mic, make sure you package it right
I'll go all out, pour my heart out, mix it around
Put my voice to these beats, let it mix with the sound

It's no other than... no other than Canibus on the mic
It's no other than... no other than Canibus on the mic
This gotta be the biggest track I ever touched in my life
Like the club can't breathe cause I'm clutchin too tight
You 'bout to see a live Canibus eruption tonight
Thugs in black, the bitches in white
I got the olive green marine fatigues on for sensitive light
Took my time with the rhyme to build, I'm alive and well
Got that seven figure dollar smell
Take a chance baby, not Chanel
She come check me at the telly in a minute with the longest L
As soon as she got there, the plot got clear
The bitch volunteered brains and she didn't stop there
Hot and fierce, she was not prepared
Pounded her upside down from the top of the stairs
'Til her breasts? started poppin the airs
She thought it would last forever but I told her I was droppin this year
C'mon

It's no other than... it's no other than...
No other than Canibus on the mic
Give me a (C, A, N, I, B, U, S) - c'mon!
It's no other than... it's no other than...
It it, it-it's no other than
Give me a (C, A, N, I, B, U, S) - c'mon!

I can't stay long, I'm on my way to the bank
But while I'm here, I'd like to thank
Canibus supporters, they knew the time
Ask 'em, who's the nigga with the dopest rhymes?
(Go 'Bis, go 'Bis) Yo bring it back one more time
And ask 'em, who's the nigga with the dopest rhymes?

I give you far to go, murder the flow

On the tour bus they searchin the coach
In the airport they searchin my coat, they say they searchin for dope
""Legal Drug Money"" stickers on the back of my bag
The only artifact from my past that I still have
I'm a brand new man, with a brand new plan
Talkin to bitches new tannin in the Cancun sands


I play the nine, you play the target
Y'all all know my name, so I guess I just start this
I'm so swift and that's a natural fact
I'm like RIP, I mark a C on your back
Yo, follow me into a, solo
To get the flow.. that you can picture like a photo
They say I'm shallow, I never learned to swim
But they mention my name cause I got the urge to win
Tell me who's your weed man, how you smoke so good
You a superstar baby, why you still in the hood?
Damn!  I hate to brag but you know I'm good
If a mic was a gun I'd be 'Bis Eastwood

Mad tricks up the sleeve

Just tell me that you love me, I'll say I love you too

Yo yo, I love my life; I love my wife
I love my daughter; and I love my mic
If you love me, I love you, I'm humble
I won't do things to bug you and start trouble
If you want an autograph, I'ma sign it
I don't care if the plane's leavin and I get left behind it
I'm not that simple-minded
If I had the time, I'd probably type it, or get Stan to write it
You don't shower Canibus with kindness cuz he's the nicest
You do it cuz you genuinely like him
Sure I'll talk to you in private
You might get backstage tickets or ice cream for your politeness
Shake my hand if you like Bis
But you can give me a hug if you got love, try it
Extend ya arms around me, then bend ya arms
Spread the love, a virus created by God
I'm really speakin from the heart cuz I'm touched by you
And I'm glad that you love me, cuz I love you too!

Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out that you got love for us!
Ah-ha, ah-ha! We found out that you got love for us!


Yeah I know you got love, when you see me you wanna hug me
All excited, hoppin around like the Easter Bunny
I'm like a puppy, all I wanna do is lay down and cuddle
That's why I'm happy that you could finally say that I love you
Nothin wrong with showin feelings to me, cuz I'ma G
And so I can tell you overwhelmed by the way that you breathin
Know you ran up here to see me, wishin that you could be me
Callin people at home while they watchin me on the TV
I'm a household name, with the power to spit flames
Then I flip and give the children somethin they can get with
You love me, then why you got that look in ya eye?
Why every single time you see me you be actin surprised?
No it ain't all for nuttin somethin got to be somethin
And I ain't givin you no paper, so you got to be frontin
What was you doin at ten shows I tore down overseas
And it's funny how you was at the album signing in Queens
Ain't hard to tell you lovin anything connected with Pak
And once I recognize I be the type to give it back
Don't try to fool me, been doin this, I'm no dummy
On a mission to get it, and I'm winnin, you gotta love me!

So the most important people in this room are not us but the students
And I want to say to you kids who've come along
First of all, thanks very much for turning out
And secondly, think about what we're talking about
Because these are important issues
Even if they're not on the test
These are really important issues to you as a human being
And I hope that you won't... won't agree with me... won't agree with any of us
That you'll make your own minds up
But I hope you will think about them and talk about them

Two times for all of the MC's
Canibus, this is the brainstream
Brainstream nigga, yeah

Uh-huh...uh-huh
Yo, Yo, Ayo
I spit so ferocious I can't stay focused
Watch the ambience of the tone switch
When I'm in mic mode, ELF overload
The proverbial verbal toe to toe, foot to your throat
Ding ding get in the ring nigga, answer your phone
Rap so sick the friction will leave your lips swole
Sippin on sour cold sauce syrup slow
Rippin the flow till your face looks like strawberry pulp
Scan your whole area code...call the crib like, ""Is he home?""
Tell him to come alone and ""click"" phone
Spit rhymes and split skulls
Miserable pitbulls leave you with turnakit wrapped wrist bones
From Fort Hood to Fort Green
My metaphors bling, Lord of The Rings, I'm the thorazine king
Hold that... hold this... put the mic down before you catch thrombrosis
You holding a Cris? I'm in your house feeding your fish in your robe and slips
Holding your old ladies tit, frequent visitors stick a dick in her
Supreme lyricist with built antique twenty fusion inhibitors
Citizens scared of the minimum lyrical derivitive forty-four curriculum
Syllables caliber killing em
Damn nigga, what you think of him?
Feeling that nigga dun!
For real, cause that nigga been spittin for a minute son
They wanna get rid of him, that's why they belittle him on the mic
He ain't human, that's what I keep tellin them
If they don't wanna play him on FM then F-them
He don't care about them, the mic is his best friend
Throw a beat on and bless him
Battle... bring ya best men, XXL X-Men
My rap cracks the thermostat reset the temp at 180 degrees
Please, it's no sweat, all I need to know is where and when
Talk to my agent and make sure the craft service is Jamaican
Record through 32x lense, right brain connect with left hem
The REM is high res, my surveillance disrespect feds
Anti-social, dyslexic, doing CAT Scans at the pet shem
The MC mortuary endorser, mortifier turns the audience to dismembered corpses
Slap bootleggers with a novelty tax, enforced by the Rap Coalition Poverty Act
Blackballed, but what's it feel like not to be black?
Universal got my stock, I want my property back
Spit hard and never got a dime
Spit the hottest rhymes, in modern times and still got ostracized
For the intelligent community that reads my lyrics
What I've writing deserves a legional merit
This is the precarious position of a rap star dead serious
With hilariously bizarre, share your verses with the gods
R-A-W-W-A-R, flow for 108 bars, I took nothing and gave all
Yo, look up in the sky
A burning star quasar when I rhyme
Artwork of an undetermined design
I still shine quoteables of an uncorrodable kind
Lightning bolt struck the pen and I wrote a few lines

After we fry you, we puff a blunt and then it's gravy
And you can keep her cuz we don't care about ya lady
Iiiii've gotta get that dough! AIGHT!!

Aiyyo it's only a handlefull of rap critics
That every had a close-encounter with this rap wizard
You wack rappers can't rip it
In other words your lyrics are too primitive
You need to be more descriptive
Look at the way I flipped it, a True Hollywood Story
I manipulated this miserable music business
Then I caked off two, by going independent
How much you make an album? About ten cents
I make about ten cents, every sentence
It's my third album and I'm workin on my tempence
I don't brag; I'm keep it modest
I'm ain't hot; I'm the hottest
I'm not being pompus, I went through a process
I used to be a prophet, now I make profits
You sound like garbage, one of these days you gon' end up jobless
Pushin a shoppin cart with the same Cristal bottles
You was drinkin out of when shit was poppin
I seen a episode on VH1 Documents
They talked about your drug addiction and what was behind it
The bottom line is, how much you sold
No one gives a fuck if you blow, you gotta get that dough
I'm tired of niggas talkin about it, but I can't live without it
I'm stuck if I ain't got it, so what's the logic?
Should I talk about material objects, and get on some
""How you like me now bitch,"" wearing a shiny outfit?

But no matter what I do I'mma get that dough, fo' sho'!

Always got ya'self up in the middle of the drama
Frontin for nothin cuz ya niggas told me you pussy
Need to get smarter and try to holler at the rookies
Fuck with Canibus & Pak and get that ass a coffin
FUCK what you thinkin faggot, we rippin niggas open
Now is a new day and we be focused on the paper
Still'll get in you but the feeling for dough is greater
Piling with hate and you need to holler at the maker
If you don't do it now, then you gotta face it later
Don't even think about tryna dim a nigga shinin
You gon' fuck around and get slapped up with the iron
Everything we do is connected with gettin paper
And you ain't talk about it, so nigga I'll see you later

I'm proud of my music cuz it's dope and I wrote it
True Hollywood Stories opens in October
Directed by none other than Canibus for a coper
It's no stoppin me, my commodity is growin
I'll fly anywhere on this planet to promote it
Maybe I should come out with my own line of clothing
I printed up some Canibus shirts and I sold 'em
I jump on stage, and I prove I'm a showman
Can-I-Bus is a microphone omen
I slam it when I'm done to make sure that it's broken

I wanna thank my mother, I wanna thank my brother
For makin the film, cause all the support was very important

That never let me down from day one - I'm just inebriated to be here
I wanna thank you all

It was hot back then when it was new, but
I did this other film, ""Gone Til November""
Me and Wyclef was in the trenches together
I did a big movie with him, he put me on soundtracks
Back then, I didn't understand the music business

In the Rain,Mind Control,2005,"Drivin' all night through the rain
Tryin' to escape the pain
I can't get away
With the way I drive will I make it home alive?
How will I survive?
Serial killer, slasher, Rip the Jacker
Been on America's Most and still can't be captured
Think about it, how am I supposed to feel?
If you ain't have a record deal, how would you feel?
In a world where it seems like you're all alone
Like my name didn't help the rap market grow
Like I'm hardly gold, like I ain't got a remarkable flow
When I deserved to die old and broke
I'd rather have an overdose doin' coke or dope or both
Gettin' bathed in a bathhouse by Dorothy Dandrich
Halle Berry and Jennifer Lo, bending over for soap
What a way to go
A friend of mine told me that I know a lot of nothing
I looked him in the eyes and said at least I know something
I know I've been driving all night through the rain
And I'm lookin' for a sunny day
I wanna run away

I be the first one to tell you I'm an ill emcee
But I'm a human being and if you prick me, I bleed
I might bleed internally, but it's still hurting me
Can-I-bus is not what he deserves to be
I just wanna rhyme, I don't wanna beef wit you
But if you bite me, I'mma put my teeth in you
I want the whole world to say, ""Canibus, I believe in you""
The same way, my man, Ricky Lee would do
Don't stereotype us, we freedom fighters
We drive all night through the rain wit' no wipers
I paid that price a couple of times
And when I'm on the mic, I spit double the rhymes
I ain't scared of the competition
But I want you to listen to me even when I'm not rippin'
I hope you never have to feel my pain
I hope you never have to drive all night through the rain

Will somebody please tell me, what does it take?
I been on promotional tours, from state-to-state
I've done a 100 Bars on mixtape
People recognize the face, but the sales don't equate
I guess I'll plead guilty if
Rippin' a rhyme is a crime
Cause I'mma get mine or die tryin'
I'm verbally inclined to shine
I spin like a turnbine and blow the rain clouds out the sky
I drive through the rain til the roads get dry
Bonafide Gladiator that was born to ride
You could never put a price on my pride
If I have to, I'll swim against the tide til my arms get tired
But I won't disappear and I will not be quiet
Or get pushed to the side, I will not be denied

PhilaFlava Freestlye,UnKnown,UnKnown,"This is the most magnetic rap edit ever permitted
I'm the best that ever done it to somebody that did it
You sinnin' if you don't mention my name when you say lyrics
Been spittin' since the beginnin' and never been timid
Professor of English, drink a cup of tea like the British
Biblical menace that's searching for the meaning that's hidden
I rap for rippers, rip it for the lyrically privileged
Strangle you bitches, battle Canibus? You trippin'
Put your money where your mouth is, my dick where your chin is
Swallow my flow like bow waves from boats in Venice
My sentence telepathy lettered, take over your mind for a second
Meditate at it till your eyes redden
It's the automatic kinetic energy in the present
Real G's spittin' geometric sentence impressions
Germaine starts with a G, who woulda guessed it?
The spirit of St. Germaine in my studio sessions
Tellin' me what to tell 'em, I'm his vernacular vessel
Binary bar stars make me rap infinitesimal
Kick it so intelligently and intensely
You only a fool when you in the presence of me
The underlined agenda, under thoughts
Release, furl, 'n reverse course
Pick the hydrophone up and talk
Operational priority dispatch, spittin' raps, trippin' the wack
Ya'll don't want Bis to attack
Don't act like you forgotten me, this is Debauchery
You won't get the nod from me, I put it down constantly
Ask Hip-Hop heads in ya' area, Imma Spit Bull terrier
The more metaphors the merrier
Pardon my fingernails, I just buried the mic
A hundred thou...
Feisty enough to fight, so they scared of my bite
Black holes coalesce when I tear through the light
I got a
Funky, funky, funky, funky flow
Yeah, funky times four is funky you know
I'm the C-A-N-I-B-U-S, my M-E-T-H-O-D is the best
You still not impressed?
My tongue compress, puncture your chest
Suck ya' breath, rob ya' lungs for the breath
Poppy seed resin send you to Mic Club heaven
Light-seconds away from galaxy M87
God caused these charged particles to collide
Within the wandering, magnetic fields in my mind
Still on the grind
I do this in my spare time with spare rhymes
Cause' I stopped looking for shine
They can't take what's already mine
Shoemaker–Levy 9'll land on 'em when they press rewind
A mental diamond in a physical bondage waiting for embalmment
Maybe then I'll be with some real prophets
Oh my god, Canibus is on the college campus!
I wanna ask him some questions 'cause I love his answers
He got a new album out, he the illest son
.44 curriculum syllabus caliber killin' em'
November 19th, the Mic Club spot check
Can't figure out how the bootleggers got it legged
You want respect? Come to MicClub.net
Try to move ya' mouse after I chop ya' wrist
Ok, settle down kid, stop talking big
Cause' today we gon' have a pop quiz on Bis

""Yo, what's up my main man?
What's your name?
I heard you got beats
Yea, I hear what you're saying, but are they flames?
You got a card or something?
Put your number on this CD, I'll give you a call or something
How long you in town?
Where you staying at now?
Who's your manager? Him over there?
The nigga with the South Pole sweatsuit and permed hair?
Listen, don't even trip
I just want some beats to finish my shit
I'm looking for some hard shit
Yea, like some Beat Brokers or Mark Sparks shit
Huh? Play what?
Hold up, lay what?
Yo relax my main man, I'ma call you, peace""
I got back to the crib, popped in the CD
And turned it up loud to see if he had some real beats
I heard something I felt, I hit the nigga on the cell
To see if it was for sell
""Yo, can I speak to DJ
Yo, I'm feeling tracks two and six
Whatever, bottom line, you give me the tracks, I give you the cheddar
We can do it around ten PM
In the studio off of Lankershim
At that point, I didn't even feel like answering him
Stupid ass motherfucking producer got me real upset
And I even got to work with him yet
I showed up at ten thirty so I was already late
He showed up after me and forgot to bring his own D.A.T. tapes
He shook my hand, with both of his hands
And told me he could play it over again, with both of his friends
Yo, as long as I get tracks two and six
I don't give a fuck who really produced this shit
Just do this shit
When I get back, I want it laid
Yea, you gonna get paid
I'ma leave, jump in the car, speed, go to my mans
Get some trees, get something to eat, and I'll be back by three""
These stupid producers
""Hold up, five hours later, you ain't laid nothing?
Not one piece of percussion? You mean to tell me you ain't press one button?
You think this is motherfucking pre-production or something?
You know we ain't got a budget, who told you to order lunch, bitch?
You know what? Fuck it. I don't even want it no more
Cause the track you selling me probably ain't even yours""

Wu-Flix,Melatonin Magik,2009,"English, motherfucker, do you speak it!?

Fat chinchilla jackets, massive scrilla
Ninja rap, guerrilla tactics, mad master killer
Clan tracksmith, drunk monkey, the bad ass (bastard)
Dispatching nasties on these wack, backpackin' rappers
The samurai tuckin' the blade
You's gon' get your bitch back when I'm done fuckin' her face
And shoving a wang in her jaw, let it all (hang)
Orangutan slang, strange renaissance, Capdonna
Page cage fighter, Ghost Killah, Wu track force
Visit the village of craft, this is the rap lord
Bang on the repercussion drum, pump slum science
Rum diet, ten rapplications, one client, I am (drunk)
Slumped, I am, punch junk, rhyme flyin' bolts
So flyaniacal, fire floats at vile vultures
No style, so Idlewild, so profesh
Don't flex on the kid, don't step, aight?

How does one do that? Hm?
How does one kill a man?
It's one thing to dream about it
Very different when you have to do it with your own hand

This has probably been a long time comin'
Any small-time thug'll spent a long time runnin' from this all-time great
Only forty plus a hunnid, but you couldn't hold my weight
So fuck it, straight gunnin' from the old line state
That is Murdalyn, never heard of it? Well, I preferred ya didn't
But the burner's sure to turn your shirt into a tourniquet
And you'll be learnin' quick
I'm earnin' as earnest a livin' as any surgeon is with every word I spit
And every bird I flip, I'm raising the stakes, yeah
Literarilly, should be comparing me to Shakespeare
A little heresy, but something I wanna make clear
I'm just a lost soul at the crossroads of the eighth sphere
""The Devil's gate's near,"" that's what they all sayin'
And then they see my long grey beard and a 3 pronged blade
So on a off day, I might perform facial feng shui
Till your nostrils are facing the wrong way

This is Wu-Flix, knock your teeth out with a toothpick
I hear you spittin' that bullshit
I chop your mama arm off with a katana and stick dick to ya father
You won't ever be the same, grasshopper
""I'll murder the motherfucker,"" yeah, I know you would
There are many things the rest of us would do if we could
I do whatever it takes to keep you alive
I go outside, knowing that I'm gonna die
Standing in the corner, I got my Sticky Fingaz face on
Count to four, bum rush the door
Nigga tried to rush me, I bust three
Turn him to duck meat, the 187 was rusty
Motherfucker don't touch me
Walk around, everybody love me
Benetton suits and gumbys
So if the boy wants to have sex, then let him have sex
When he turns eighteen, I'll let him sleep with my ex, next

My iron fortress is protected by the eye of Horus
The vile sorcerer that rides atop of wild horses
Settle scores of vendettas, left your shelter scorched
Deltas force melt your paws with a welder's torch
Never knelt before God, never felt remorse
Spinning propellers, left fellas short on my heliport
In the morgue cellar, fill a drawer with a headless corpse
My album's fucked up, that shit'll never sell in stores (No)
My consumer base is viewed as a mutant race
Humans that grew from the fumes of nuclear waste
If you get a taste of my music, you get erased
And interchange with an image of your livin' wraith
Drippin' with acidic hate, pistol whippin' little fake
Children when I'm spittin' written riddles in a fit of rage
I wanna murder motherfuckers with my vocal sound
And choke 'em with the smoke that get ejected from my open mouth

 What the fuck you want to talk about nigga?
 Why You screaming man?
 I'm The Illest! I'm the illest...
 Yo Relax... put that down man
 Yo don't tell me to relax I'll beat your skinny little ass
 Yo What the fuck is wrong with you?
 Fuck You!

You fuckin' hate me, you fuckin locked me in the basement
And you still want me to protect you, it doesn't make sense
Canibitch, I supported you like a weight bench
Without me your defenceless, you betta' face it
You ain't show me love when you was at ya' apex
Gettin' paychecks, up at the radio with DMX and Flex
Catchin' wreck while Noriega was catchin' his breath
I had to keep the situation in check
Look at the varicose veins in my neck, Germaine is the best
The industry fucked you I'm just payin'em back
What's the matter w/ slayin' these Jackers, that's all I been doin
Besides talkin' shit I ain't done nuthin' to'em
They just mad cause when I see'em I don't run up to'em
Between me and you yo-know I'll run right thru'em

Calm Down!

Who you tellin' to calm down nigga I'm a Ripper remember
I told you not to do ""Gone Till November""
But you wouldn't listen, I always had ya' best interests in mind
I wrote all ya' best lyrical lines
If it wasn't for me you'd be writin' pitiful rhymes
On the stage if you was tired I would spit'em sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
I would just be quiet, stand to the side and let the shit ride
But I'm gettin' tired of havin' to remind you Bis
If it wasn't for me nobody would've signed you Bis...

C'mon Rip? You a lyin' ass bitch and you know it
Group Home was part my company I co-owned it
If there's one thing I learned in showbiz, stay focused
And don't quit. Rip, why you talkin 'bout old shit?

Germaine, you fuckin' water brain, don't you understand?
Fuck the mainstream, you should just call out names
The industry's all about game...
I shit on 'em all the same and leave spit stains on they brain
Like liquid chocolate spillin' all over ya' new white trainers
Insane is an understatement, I'm Satan
Canibus is a Mason, I don't know what the fuck Germaine is
I just know that both ya'll are trying my patience
I don't give a fuck about a beat I been rhymin' for ages
Rippers are dangerous, and all jackers are afraid of us
You wanna' face me Bis? Kick a rhyme!

No, That's ridiculous...

Aiiight then, listen to mine...
I'll jump into costume, impromptu, just to rob you
Put the nozzle to ya' eyeball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out thru ya' nostrils
Bury you next to shark fossils, make it impossible to find you
Depths that Jacque Cousteau himself wouldn't dare to dive to
With goggles, oxygen bottles and Doppler effect modules
Lock you in a time capsule and smash the console
Shit on you in reverse suck you into a brown hole
Suck the power outta' ya' soul
Ya' nuthin but a coward in a cold freezer with an hour to go
Watchin' my casio stopwatch countin it slow
Like drug lords checkin to see if it's talcum or coke
I could kill you by drownin the globe
Or I could just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in ya' throat
In battles I'm a thousand and oh, I silenced the Pope
Do you know how many rhymes I've economically grossed?
No? I thought so... Neither do I
It's a dick between ya' mothers thighs divided by Pi
I'm the sickest linguistically illicit lyrical misfit in the business
And possibly in existence, what's your consensus?
Studied my own syntax statistics since '96 wit CPA certified assistants
I've made the decision that my standards are above precision
The only thing I could honestly say I love more than women are dope writtens
If it ain't dope then don't spit it
Don't be sensitive and get on the defensive just practice ya' penmanship
If you can't spit at high temperatures then just quit
Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left
According to the manufacturers specs, you'll make a mess
Rupture the blood vessels in ya' neck fuckin' with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disks
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversions kits
With a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
You never experienced work like this, nigga welcome to the serpentine world where I twist
The world where that I Rip, the world that I Fixed, the world where I live

Ok Rip, you made your point, I can't out rap you
You said you was the illest, I would never doubt that too
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
You are the illest alive, that's a fact that you've proved
It's just a couple rappers that don't want it to happen for you
Raggin' on you like battlin' is all you can do
You didn't sell enough units to be honest with you
Nobody knows the truth you got talent out the gazoo
When niggas first heard of you it was like a Man On The Moon
You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too
So what if the ladies think he's more handsome than you?
What happens if the rumors about being a faggot are true?
Look what it's runnin' into, I don't feel like havin' this discussion with you
I'm tired of fuckin' with you, niggas in the game don't wanna' do nuthin' with you
Bussin' with you, goin' one on one with who?
They wanna get rid of you, ya' shit is too lyrical
Headhunters out to get you, that's why I have to protect you
I wouldn't disrespect you, as another intellectual
Without you I'm unsuccessful, God bless you
What makes you think I left you or why I'd ever be tempted to?
Ever since the 3rd album I been mentioning you
I got your name on my arm I'm representin' you
You're Rip The Jacker - I would never question you
I respect your opinion as a professional nigga'
I just want you to listen to what I'm tellin' you
What happened between L and you - Forget it!
People know you won the battle they won't give you the credit
A lot o' people don't wanna' admit it
But I consider it a real privilege to bear witness to ya' lyrics
And be involved with sharing the merits, I'm forever indebted
I just need you to chill for a second, so I can send a positive message
Like 2Pac before he left us, the author or the work ethic Genesis
Has inspired me to write the Exobus scripts as a constant reminder not to forget Bis
But I've reached a precipice, remember Rip
You can't rhyme forever there's always a ripper with better shit
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
You're a commodity Rip ain't that how you wanna' keep it?
I keep ya' whereabouts secret
I bring bitches to the crib every weekend, so why is you beefin'?

Ayo Stop patronizing me, you despise me
All you wanna' do is steal rhymes from me
You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fuckin zombie
If I was priority you would acknowledge me
You ain't shit neither you ain't got no college degree
You can't rhyme without me, stop smilin at me

Jaecyn Bayne, Son One, Chopp Devize, Canibus {*echoes*}

Undergod soldier, running off toasting
A notebook and vocals, a smidge overdosing
Even when the D-boy system not coasting
You hear my spoken better than when Rae lost his focus
Crystallized opiate to victimize opponents
With addictive lines coated in, snares and some solar hits
Motive is to sew up in ya, dopest with a doper grit
Son, Can-I, and I, Pai Mai's chosen men
Transcontinental connoisseurs of the art of war
Knocking off non-essential artists which ya shopping for
The buck stops when I step in the voicebox
And unload bars like they're several joy shots
Yellow light caution, my melatonin's arching
Sleep on me, and I'ma get to sleep stalking
Technicians of lyrics, racketeering of sound
That'll surely be your last at your burial grounds

Ayyy~! Get 'em, metaphorically speaking, this set of bars
Is letting off till several squads is deaded and weakened
Or probably beheaded and beaten, severed and leaking
I get it, started like before I parted I settled in Eden
But evolved over the course of time
More was just forced to fall off course for the shine (yeah!)
I'm the ultimate, no alternate
Swords can give, darts with tips, dipped in arsenic
Most sound like nothing like after me
Track murdered the graveyard's busting at the seams
(When I crush) like a nug out of the bag of the trees
To be honest, your rhymes sound like rotten to me (word)
I'm the sun, I'm the rise, and the fall
When I die and collapse the whole sky'll dissolve
(Yeah) And I fight for the cause
You should say my name first when describing the boss

Put up your laptop break the boombox plug your infantry your iPod
No need for tough talk, or rocking up in the streets with Krylon
Hip-Hop is not forgotten, its been watered down like {?}
Tick tock me waving the time bomb, blowing it up so it don't die off
That's why I'm on the job with balls to supercharge your ions
I be the icon you read about in multiple {?}
Consulted by God, still open the third eye like I'm a Cyclops
To keep my mind strong, I memorize entire rhyme blogs
Emcees try hard, but many just get sunk like a battleship
And missing a bunch of requirements like {?} an asterisk
Fact or fiction I can't tell the difference when half of these rappers spit
Ignorant, I bet they don't even know what the meaning of wackness is
You actually think you're good, sorry man, your talent is absent kid
I guess them folks won't ever be dope no matter how much they practice it
Illy inject the game with passion, putting an end to the abstinence
There's so many things for you to fathom but for now it's class dismissed

(Get 'em!) As we proceed to MC
Keep it real recognize the skills over the beat
Hold up, don't shine your boots up, you still suck
You can't rhyme like this, unless you rhyming with US
Fuck the questions~! Find out for yourself
You got to find out who you help
Service to brothers, service to others, service to self
There's no way to tell
Even if you got a mic in your grill
You wanna sell? It's got nothing to do with being ill
I rock bells with a glass of water and a melatonin pill
Put your soul into a spell, stay still
The universe moving at a pace, perhaps it'll all be revealed
For me this all happened because of a record deal
For you, this happened because of what you all feel
And now nobody can copy me, I am my own technology
You pay homage to me electronically
One out of three speak about they flawed philosophies
Betrayal, that is the cause of all hypocrisy
We are living in the garden of technocracy
I am my own technology, ten thousand G
What's the weight of a light beam? Ask Killah Priest
He gon' tell you that your soul is not ready to be released
I'm a king with a slave's pair of feet, a flat-footed freak
I walk around hooded in the streets
Looking for beats, the djinn creep looking for beef
They looking for the emcees with the invisible speech
So do not even look up at what you are beneath
Just stare straight ahead and pretend you're on the beach
My breathing becomes labored after they shock me with a taser
I fell to my knees then they shot me with a laser
Beat Butcha, one thousand bar street pusher like that
Snap, spring coil tap, release trigger
Melatonin Magik, metal drones with payload attachments
Shoot me in the head till I stop rapping
Jaecyn Bayne, Son One, Propane Germaine
One day I'm a show you what we all made
Melatonin Magik, the golden child chanted
Daddy, the cell phone got too much static
Melatonin Magik is now tracking all known air traffic
Unknown traffic, just red flag it
Melatonin Magik, go to sleep, do not panic
The heart of your soul is in the planet
Melatonin Magik, turn your face to the left you maggot
Don't look at me unless you want a challenge

Nobody,Mind Control,2005,"You know this rap game is a lot like high school
And high school is a lot like life
You see in life, you got to do things to set yourself apart from your peers
You need to identify the qualities that separate you from those around you
After all, isn't that what most people spend they lives trying to accomplish?
Wouldn't we all want somebody, somewhere later on down
The line to remember the things that were different about us?
Don't you understand? The more you fit in, the less you're noticed
That's how it is, for anyone to walk through life unnoticed as if they never mattered
Could be a punishment worse than death, and at the same time
That punishment is the only way you could truly be free;
Free from the things you want people to remember about you
But also free from the things you want them to forget
I don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore
And even though I dream about what it would be like
It's just a dream, because I realize now more than ever
That I can't have my cake and eat it too, no one can
And as time goes on, we will always be loved by some and hated by others
And whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not
They really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name
You see, anytime anybody ever talks about you, either directly or indirectly
They put a quarter in your immortal meter
They keep you alive, whether they want to or not
They practically do the opposite of what they want to do
Which is forget you. I dedicate this song, to the day
When you motherfuckers finally figure it out
And the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me
Here lies a man, who became forgotten to the world
In his search to the key for immortality
He never made an impact, he changed nothing
And his words meant nothing
He never contributed to the rap game;
He never gave you anything to talk about
He never existed, and he never made a difference
His name was nobody!",https://genius.com/Canibus-nobody-lyrics

Life is about learning to live with what you can't control

Motherfucker nearly crashed the chopper

Do or do not do, there is no try
Looking at the Phoenix Rise

Formula 1 champagne son, stage one
Stage two, stage three,  stage four ya done
1 million titties, 500 thousand girls
Georgia guide stones diamonds and pearls

We eat Wyghu beef, the Phoenix sunrise in the east
The language is scientific but street
The mountain man was told to go pound sand, there's fresh water in them lands, sittin' on his horse folding his hands
Who am I don't ask, I'ma ask you if you old enough to dance
Cause right now you holdin' up the plans
I sleep for a thousand years, woke up with a beard
Looking at my light aura in the mirror
Life is about learning to live with what you can't control
The soul plays a substantial role
A fighter jet barrel rolls over a narrow road
Goin so fast my head was shaped tadpole
I'm in Booger Hollow Alabama
Told the bitch to make me a sandwich
Got that peanut butter jelly goin ham with the hammers
And ham radio scanners smoking turtle with Santa
The Space Warden race around orbit for their blatant enjoyment
Try to find a better place of employment
Eyes cast below looking for the Phoenix sun rise
Pray and fast cause spirits are among the skies

They parked their spaceship right on the pavement
Formula 1 champagne son, automatic pneumatic lung
My big dun Domingo on the drums
Contained in the corridor between Pennsylvania and Baltimore 
Miss Moneypenny hold all calls
Canibus Planet composed of Pelodian Granite
My handset batteries dead - I'm stranded
Spiritually awakened, banished within corporeal spaces
In ultra magnetic places off world bases
The black cube, the Kaaba, Esharra the Goddess
I showed her my potential for knowledge she made me a
 promise to give me Non Local Photon Vocals, with Higgs Boson Portals
To grow my very own Robot Cultures
A lie is short lived but so is the long truth
Who do you sing  songs to? Who do you belong to?
I belong to the One that created me
The One that has never forsaken me
The One who watch patiently
While I made the worst mistake then reincarnated me
Stand tall - no fear on the gateway to nowhere
No emotion so the poetry's clear
My Robot more advanced than any Rock Band...
Believe it! Above Pop Secret
A thousand fallen demons gotta blog talk podcast grievance
Frankenstein Aryan eyes
Hazel, black or brown eyes all looking at the purple sunrise
Aurora Borealis outside my Alaskan Palace
As long as the rap contract valid
If I can do something then I'ma do it got dammit
If you can't do nothing you need to improve God damn it!!

Cut chop and slash like price of trash

As the universe expands
I contemplate whether it was Canibus or c0mpl3x that made man
Sometimes I wonder how come we can't live without guns
What would of been the outcome if the South won
Think about that son
What in the hell caused the assassination of Malcolm
The federal communications commission
Listens to politicians in the position to make certain decisions
Like putting minorities in prison
To decimating the population of women, it's called socialism
From the United States to the United Kingdom
I mega mix to A beat till the Moon leaks blood, now what?


And as globalism expands
I recognize several disparities that exist between modern man
When I was young, I was intellectually outgunned
It took some time to figure out how it was done
The concept of love think about that one
The absence of it got human beings fighting over crumbs
The general rejuvenation admission uses proof of statistics
Standard encryptions to keep the truth hidden
Like a bunch of male chauvinist bigots
Confederates hate niggas
And they take orders from right-wing lizards
Who support wicked, indignant, corrupt politicians
To mislead the system and miseducate children
It stopped raining, the roof top drip dropped draining
I look out the window, forever tainted
The worlds in trouble we pray to save it
There's blood on the pavement
They claimed violent crime, drug related
The poor people can't afford payments
And when you look across the board it's all the same shit, nigga


Color doesn't divide us, just injustice and silence
One good man is robbed of his promise
The Nazarene dream like little league softball teams
Good Morning Vietnam, the time is now 11:53
Goldberg Just reported, my verse was retarded with vampire garlic
And verbal vitriolic backed up by so much knowledge
With so many bars to process
1 minute till midnight that gives you about
30 seconds to live right so just sit tight
30 seconds on the buzzer, the president says you rich motherfuckers better pay capital gains to the public
It's only fair but they don't wanna share
Poor people starving everywhere but they don't care
Yeah, I live in the greatest country on the globe
But NO every man is not equal, not even close
(not even close, but maybe just a little bit)


The global money saga, angels, demons, cops, and robbers
We got many problems in common with the old timers
Ownership of the soul, the keyword is control
I don't even wanna be in that mode but who does?
The mental slave, the slave that can spell his own name
But can't see through this belicos game
Sabotaged deceit gunned down in the street
Systemically murdered then hung from a tree
Now that's what we call a fait accompli
I just rap to the beat, look what they've done to me
Wow my pen pal is the DuJAL
He say I'm foul because he think I took his lyrical style
But my style is my own, the fear of God purified my tone alone
Writing poems in my Uruguay home
Gotta be grateful to have a roof over my head
And that your family is sustainably fed
Hip Hop is boastful pride we hide our emotional side
Rip you up like a dry water slide, cuz

"Mikey Destruction, Devastating Tito & DJ Slice","Time Flys, Life Dies...Phoenix Rise",2015,"Canibus calls him the master of black acetate vinyl
From New York City to Cairo
DJ Slice

Assassination attempt, the blood had a stench
Bloodhounds picked up the scent, I thought we was friends
Wearing a lab coat, looking through the microscope lens
He say he'd never sniff coke again, fuck that
Give me the snow plow, bust it all down
Freestyle in the dollar van all the way uptown
The bait is always food, pussy and water
It smells so good, it sleepwalk you to your slaughter
Hip Hop awarder ahora, stand next to Rita Ora
Straight balls on the track no chorus
The dollar general, street corner sentinel reputable
Sell a few sidewinders for revenue
What you saying? Tut took a nigga chain
Then put a Michael Jackson glove on, I can’t explain
Spit, live nigga shit, you get the gist
From AR to the K-Bar, customized grip

Who want it? Come and get it, we can spit it if you with it
One lyric will leave a hole in the logo of your fitted
Bars like penitentiaries mellow, win mentally
Destroy the enemy acapello and instrumentally
Canibus and Destruction back to back
Causes spontaneous combustion on a track
Lyrics flame on anything we put our name on
That’s why your ears been burning since the song came on
Lames gone, game’s on, this is no joke
The pros choke, that cynical shit will get your nose broke
Subliminal shit is a waste
I don’t have to speak in riddles ‘cause I’ll say it to your face
And this is just a little taste
‘Cause if I really start spitting it, this shit will catch a case
Check your history, y’all niggas can’t get with me
I’m your favorite MC to the fifth degree

A  model, Diallo, hollows the Mellow Man
The stage ain’t Apollo, them hollows will leave ‘em hologram
The war season, there’s more treason
The core reason these cats fiending for me, I cruise Norwegian
I’m articulate, bomb tickin’, I’m armed lyrics
The mortician that lift the spirits from your formed physics
As egotistical 
make ‘em shake like I’m mystical
Keep his face in a pistol this station will run municipals
It’s our century, commentary is monetary
My monastery is armor heavy I was born ready
So bring your generals and a minute of intervals
I’ma spit on your literature, defecate and spit on you niggas
It’s broken mirrors with broken spirits the motion sickness
My flow floats across these waters like it’s open water
It’s Canibus and Mikey, Tito the rap de-vils
I break eagles like I’m breakin’ records on track needles

Spikes across the road Mikey D tag team yo
Refresh reload in magazine mode
Transition pole position the globe spinning
Chopsticks in a rice bowl with some gold in it
Bust him in the head with a brick, he hop away with no hip
He still love Hip Hop no shit
Crucifix around your neck, take the cross off your back
In fact, we thank the Lord for rap
Mirror mirror on the wall tell me what you saw
Melle Mel, Grandmaster Caz, yes yes y’all
Inside the hall of fame with graffiti on the walls
The engineer said, “Take it easy on the boards”
Attack dog jump off to shred mic chords
Put ‘em all in a cage and see what they fight for
One goat, two goats, three goats, four
We rep Hip Hop from roof top to the floor

Drop jewels with the best of ‘em, I’m cool with the rest of ‘em
Fools who keep questionin’, school ‘em and keep testin’ ‘em
Manipulate the tracks while I’m spittin’ out the facts
Slack, picking it up, you ain’t gettin’ none of that
Precise I’m nice nigga, the flow is impeccable
Amazing what some sleep, a pen and pad and a check’ll do
It started slow for me, now I'm a vet and a spectacle
They killed the rotary, so now I’m gettin’ technical
Beast mode, the East Coast will never die
In jet mode to the West Coast, forever fly
Transporter no JanSport or no camcorder
Sip a quart of water while I’m kidnappin’ your man’s daughter
Canibus said, “Ill,” I went crazy with it
Other cats said, “Chill,” fugazy with it
I got your back for life Bis, you feel me?

So whatever this rap sends me, I'ma perform
You can get an idea of how ill I be when I spit
Light three bombs, you'd be like, he hard
No longer do I do what I do for TV
Do this for my hood, I ain't rich but I'm good
All I see is essence what the lines do is definitely
Time to expand my horizons so rep this with me
Firin, pick you apart, make you gone-o
Nobody fucks with me, my spit change to pyro
My bitch ain't Cubano, nope, she's Serbian
And I hope, you know that I murder with caves like Osam-o
I'm the reason they choosin to put they dukes up
I'm the same reason they move in them bulletproof trucks

Crazy as crystal communicate correct signal
I call it lyrical, they call it criminal
Call the commissioner, I'ma crucify the christian Caligula

I cast the Canibus symbol in the crowd
If there's beef on the ground, I'ma to carve the cow

La costra nostra, deep like Deepak Chopra

Forty-five in the holster, AK in the baby stroller
Babies with baking soda, my lady in the Rover

So Into You,Hip-Hop for $ale,2005,"* Juli Ecaro harmonizes throughout Chorus, no actual verses performed
This for you girl, you know I love you
Baby

I'm so into you
I wanna do so many things to you
I can't talk without mentionin you
And let me tell you what I think of you

Yeah, my name is, none of your business, let me tell you why I love her
She hot when she in front but she stand behind a brother
She wiggle, her booty jiggle, my finger spreads her middle a little
Let me see what I might wanna get into
I always empower her, tell her that I'm proud of her
Show her I don't wanna make no housewife outta her
Sprinkle her with compliments, but I never shower her
That's the last thing I would do, cause I value love
She give me ounces of love, let me bounce the bum
And when she call my name, I come/cum
If I front she raise up, we fuss fight and break up
Then wake up in the Bahamas after we done made up
She know my psychological make-up
I'm therapeutic with the broad, we keep it raw when we make love
And can't nothin change the trust we have
Wherever we are, we think about the moments and laugh, because


When I was on tour, I held the elevator for this broad in the lobby
Seen her later on in the bar, she sat beside me
Said the guy at the front desk recognized me
And told her all about me...
She said I heard you're a rapper, career in the crapper
I know you want some ass, you probably won't give no cash up
You should fill my glass up, tell me 'bout your bad luck
And if I feel sorry enough, I'll give you the sad fuck
I had to laugh, put my hand on my gut
I told her I'd let her have the next grand that I touched
Walked back to the elevator with my hand on her butt
To the bed with the camera in front (MONEY SHOT) cut!
I hopped up and blazed one
Yo the room and tax is paid hun, stay as long as you want
I'll be back in a hour, she said that's what they all say
I know ma, I've been sayin that all day


The valet don't remember nothin, he didn't leave the engine runnin
I jump in, don't bless him with nothin
Call up this other ma, she remember I'm comin
I told her I'ma cook, but I'ma just pick up somethin
The fireplace runnin, she layin on her stomach
Nasty english all in her muffin, she love it
She giggle, her booty jiggle, my finger spreads her middle a little
Let me see what I'ma get into again
I told her I don't really like to come through her block
Cause the blueberry drop attract too many cops
Girls hop in the drop, take off they top, my belt buckle pop
They know that I'm hot, can't tell me I'm not
They surrounded the car, six cops
I was holdin up traffic for six blocks, they put me in the shitbox
Look at you now, I can't even come through your spot
And it's messin with my mind, cause I loved you a lot",https://genius.com/Canibus-so-into-you-lyrics

Why can't they see they're too weak for me
People wanna keep on talking
I guess we will see
People wanna keep on talking
Talking'

Yo, let's not talk about me, let's talk about you
Let's talk about some of the things YOU go through
Dealing with racists, being patient
Tired of waiting, what are you chasing
Sometimes you just want to just explode and spread across the globe
You wanna let the whole world know
'Hey everybody! Look at me, yo!
I used to be nobody, but know I'm known!'
Thanks to you, I never could've done it alone
Everybody that talked about me is somebody I owe
Even the G.L.O.A.T., he talked till he was numb in the throat
And I STILL took his crown with a unanimous vote
Talk about it!


Yo, you can talk about how I came back so strong
You can talk about my album and all of my songs
You can talk about Can-I-Bus the rapper
What's his name, Nobody or Rip the Jacker
Talk about my record label, Gladiator's the name
Cause I BEEN a gladiator in the game
And I swear on my government name Germaine
That at Gladiator Records, everybody gets paid
Talk about the ladies, the kind that I like
After I get laid, we can talk about the price
You can stay talking about ice
I talk about who's nice in the rap game and who got stripes
Talk about it!


I got a passion for this rapping
This is my ship, I'm the Capitan
I control your vertical and your horizontal
What you talk about and who you talk to
You got a day job and you wanna spit a hundred bars
Naw, you gotta train hard
Take a man's advice, stand and fight
Sacrifice, that's the price
I'm speaking freely, nothing's easy
FUCK the TV, you wanna be me
I ripped the Jacker with his own track
Maybe I AM the illest alive, talk about THAT!

For an entire month
Can-I-Bus? You know you can (4x)
Involuntary muscle spasm assassin busts with a passion
Listen to how Canibus re-enact this
Poor rappers fall victim to the metaphor master
Drill your ass raw for ice core data
An earthquake machine 
beam
 powered by a crystal
Scalene in hydro, no pulse signal
Lyrically wave-theory like Timothy Leary
So you don't have to understand me to hear me, you feel me?
Barely, the quickening happens in between
In the Elohim Lord Lizard King with the Ripper conditioning
Partitioning with the Fischer King eating chicken wings
My fingertips are glistening but I'm listening
Yeah, the master observes how rappers use vernacular
To fail to capture the meaning attached to the words
Hip-Hop melismas, career suicide
Killer Ripper spits to the sustained pitch mixed and chopped
To add a counter point, mix a master that drops
Complex and confusing, I'm laughing because it's hot
The super duper uber music conductor producer from the future
Stuff tubas with gunpowders to improvise bazookas
Colder than killer cobras over Jehovah
Delta soldiers in blimp balloon gondolas with stealth motors
They watch over us, told me where to go
But I can only take both of us so you better soldier up
Size, activity, location, unit
Time and equipment: What you going to do with it?

This is me burning it up

Just a coach on the side lines
Tryna bide time
Watching the game being played out through my eyes
I know it's painful how they degrade you
But I praise you
This is the soundtrack that we will train to
This is not a call to arms
I did that ten years ago
These are called keep alert bars

Don't walk just work the war

When I was born with a mic on my arm

Six minutes Canibus you on
Yes, yes y'all
To the beat god, next bar
I do this to atone
I do this to atone for my sins
But I am punished for the tone of my skin

Out in Berkley
They not too thirsty
They don't like veterans neither, but they can't hurt me
Bring it down about 14.5 DB

Ayo, Hip-hop provost
Who said the word Hip-hop the most?
Which one of yous think you a poet?
Perfect cause you practice that classic
Scholastic, Canibus man shit
The current catalogue and past tense
I do this to atone
We all must atone for our sins
But I am punished for the tone of my skin

the C means light
The light means space, my DNA strain is my base

When will the world dump the dollar in the trash bin?
It was good while it lasted, but now we’ve been lambasted
What do you think life will be like for your grandkids?
A local watchman climbed up the wall
A United Nations sniper plucked him off
He said, “If I should die before I wake
Cremate my remains and send ’em to deep space”
Creative overdrive, completely overloaded with rhymes
This is what we were supposed to design
Prometheus Proteus Prime, frontal lobes plus both sides
Golden spindles spiral over the spine
He spent the lion’s share of his life promoting skills
A wise man once said, “The son don’t chill”
Ask your boss why the HEPA filter got switched off
The press release said it has something to do with the cost
From riches to rags every scumbag is mad
You mad ‘cause we all got empty lunch bags
The deck is clean; the cables are green
The wind speed is 30 knots over the sea
Satellite targeting, air superiority
My Law: space bags, ammo and armory
Take to the sky like a falcon, look at you grounded
The mind’s eye could move a mountain
The ground beneath your feet is skidding sideways

In a golf cart talkin bout you hardcore

My gat bark, bite you like a shark
Right in the heart like a mosquito bite in the dark
You got bit you massage it, I'ma lighten your pockets
Make a withdrawal and take your deposits to split profit
My sawed-off blow arms off
Insurance don't cover what a prosthetic skull cost
It's your loss; Motherfuckers keep your ears to the streets

If you dead you can't eat so don't be a fool and
Try to protect your jewels cuz they can't protect you

Master of self but a slave to the rhythm
My wolves like dogs say sick 'em man get 'em
My slugs heat seekin if I spit 'em I'ma hit 'em
I'm a marksman spend my free time at the range
Just incase I gotta put one up in your brain
Sit your five dollar ass down before I lay change
I don't believe y'all niggas, y'all niggas been lames

Sendin these weak motherfuckers to Leviathan
Sixteens hit like the bird flu and my word true

The doctors from the proctobiologists

Imma rock again, how much you wanna bet?

From the USA to Cairo
Took the high road to Mohenjo Daro cause I'm a pharaoh
If there was no tomorrow
I'd still be the most sophisticated model of wordological babble

For example if I said I was to bust the heat
'Til the sky touch your feet

It ain't Canibus neither you got the wrong leaf
You think Hitler's dead but you got the wrong teeth

Motherfucker just look at your hands now
Who stopped ya?  Rap tighter than an anaconda
Only one problem my work com subs
Syllables rush through the position of the teeth and the tongue
Mouth to mic to speakers 'til its deep in your drum
Speak with the tongue 'til sounds like I'm speaking in tongues
When I'm done I'll leave you needing a lung
Don't have to get up
Cause I been up
Doin' sit-ups and chin-ups
And an army chin-up, I rip shit up

Go boil some water, I'm a hold him down
Interrogation techniques, I'm a show you how
I'm a ask you two times, then after that
I'm a roll you a blunt with a blasting cap
You understand what I'm sayin'? 
Your man's not playin'
You'll be twenty-one grams lighter after the weigh-in
Sharpshooters aimin', Wolfgang came in to bang him
Demo'd the nigga, then Maintain sprayed him

Yeah I sprayed him, it was strictly biz
The way I laid him to rest yo it wasn't cause I hated him
His bars were sendin him off, he was lost
Now he's, six feet deep payin the cost
Yo my enemies are unfit; they keep movin
Like they don't know I'm too strategic for this dumb shit
You're hopin that I fail; but the race is been won
But they don't know that because they slower than a snail
It's too easy, but I don't feel guilty
Cause if the slowpokes had it their way they would kill me
Now how real is this situation that I stay in
And when does a Sharpshoota got time for playin?
My whole team aimin them red beams, it's no games
It takes me no brains to leave you with no brains
I got you so pegged this is so unfair
You should start prayin to the man upstairs
Cause really all I gotta do is cock and squeeze
And your brain's on the ground lookin like cottage cheese
While I'm in the trees with top notch emcees
Sharin brilliant ideas and philosophies about
How we're gonna stack this money and lounge
In the town there's a whole lot of nothin around
Try to stop the process, and I'm huntin you down
To put your faggot ass in front of the ground, now fuck around

Hip-Hop you dead a closet casket you gon' rock instead
So tell your mans ain't no need for sendin flowers and shit
When I'm on the fiends come through and devour the shit
The block is dry, leave it up to us to shower the shit
You got beef, I slide through and Twin Tower your shit
Dynamite, I'll harass you niggas
Like pullin your shorts down in front of chicks
I'll embarrass you niggas
Actin like you John Gotti, we'll see how gangster you are
When you find pieces of your son's body
I fucked around and ate his lunch, now he got his hands full
Holdin his head and legs in the trunk
The chick I'm with, I ain't hearin the bitch
I'm rockin Sharpshoota shit, lookin for the next gear to switch

Aiyyo I squeeze on emcees like bullets never-ending
Leave the machine smokin while the terror still spinnin
Mujahadeen from Queens, an Arabian God
Suicide bomb your squad screamin Allahu Akbar
Hell gon' unleash release for beast wars
Mad rapper with a backpack strapped with C4
Barack Obama that popped the llama
And bodily harm ya, shots penetrate your armor
The young Yaphet Kotto in the dojo blowin 'dro
Clappin the fo'-fo', wanted for murderin the flow
Crazy muh'fucker I'm sick, it's been known
Rhymes retarded and bars is downs syndrome

See I don't fuckin sleep, you know my fuckin hand be on the steel
Quick with ammo, come equipped

Take small change as long as I can afford range

If the course change, I'll be in the cockpit
With the Glock cocked, lookin at the pilot all strange

I remember was no other soldier like me

Hand combat Tai-Chi, fight me
I'm Sagittarius, so I don't like Pisces
Affect you with the mic disease, try to breathe
Airborne spores reach overseas with light breeze
Out in Waikiki with ki's and G's
On a hammock with my trees like, what you need?
Got shorties in tight jeans over there, this is what life means
She suck me off, then she take me sightseein
Spendin per diem with a real nicely tanned Korean
She and her friend, they drive a little BM
Picked me up at 10 P.M., took me to the VM
Cause I was already kinda leanin off the Seagram's
I'm feelin weak, blame it on the herb rush
Yo that's Kay Slay bangin Lloyd Banks? Turn it up
I got a track after this one, I burnt it up
Big Shaq, Money Mark, Canibus, you heard of us
I do you rhyme surplus, words deluxe
Manufactured the 'Bus, just observe me once
I'm the bright light before you, the first of one
Kay Slay brought me back cause they worshipped son
The cursed one, my hip-hop heartbeat thump
Who that punk talkin junk, I'll punch the chump

Solitude in the life of a ripper is quite bitter
I ain't no social network nigga, fuck Twitter!
If I can't be lyrical I get miserable
You don't want me to be miserable, so let me go
Or detain me, entertain me, talk to me frankly
This is how you thank me? I'm one of the good guys thankfully
Good equals evil, how can it be?
How can it be?  See!
I am exactly the way I was made
Even when I change, lyrical content still bangs
Can't wait to hear what you spit over this
The beat flatline, I rhyme Jedi Mind Tricks
Vinnie Paz cannabis philanthropist
Pass it to Canibus for the assist, I hold my breath
Then I burn the shit down from the ground to the roof
All ground troops against one Canibus nuke
Next time you regroup? Bring a chemical suit
'Cause I don't want to get vegetable soup puke on my boots
The wave that interpermeates time will flat line
Radially we will be inside that line
Jedi Mind third eye will identify the force that binds
Force of the rhyme's eternal, solar sign sunspots bitten sunshine
Wow like Busta Rhymes
Give me the track, if I touch it–it's mine
Duct tape you to the table, hook you up to the jumper cables
Remember what I told you about Azâzêl
Worlds to conquer, resources to plunder
I am what you made me–a motherfuckin' monster

But check this out.  It ain't never righteous to lie on your brother, man.  You know I'm saying, tell the truth.   If it got something to do with me and you gonna air it out to the world, tell the truth man.  I came up to the studio to discuss the track, how he was gonna do it.   He told me he was getting 80 gs a track from Christina Aguilera.  The seven tracks she was hype, he was all cheesy and smiling.  He was happy about it.  He charged me 40 Gs for the track we was gonna do.  Eloise cut you the check, sent you your first half, scheduled the studio time.  I came up to D & D, dirty ass D & D.  First day he was an hour late, second day he was two hours late, third day he was three hours late, fourth day he was four hours late.  Come on man, tell the truth. When I stepped to you asked you ""Yo, tomorrow are you gonna be, are you gonna be five hours late tomorrow?"" You say ""Yo, my bad Bis, I had to move my mother out of the house.""  So I say ""All right, just call man, just call and let me know what you're doing you busy so I don't have to wait for you.  So I don't have to wait in the studio, because I got shit to do.  Everybody got shit to do around 5 o'clock in the evening.""  Come on now.  I don't know what it is man.   Niggas bringing up some shit from 14 years ago.   Like that shit is current news, like it's important now.  What's important now? How's that important?  Look how many times we work together since then, or how many times I seen you since then.    And then everybody want to know what's wrong with the culture. Know what I'm sayin'? Come on man, it's not a good look.   How does that help anyone in this situation except you?  How does it help me to for you to be out there saying I'm difficult to work with?  How does that help me?  How does it help you? You kick dirt on me, that helps you though.  Right?  Make you feel better, right?   Come on now, tell the truth.  You was late to the studio like you didn't take it serious.  Like it wasn't important to you.  You shovel shit on me like I wasn't 100% professional in working with you.  Like I didn't come through to the sessions and wait for 10 hours. I worked with DR Period on ""Salute.""  Everything was dope.  Ask DR Period how our studio session was, how I was professional.   Ask Flat Top how I was professional.  I had to go to Rakim's crib five times before he did the record. But he did it.   And the days before the day that he wrote it, he was just building, and I enjoyed it.  Why you don't speak on that?  Speak on the shit that's good for hip hop.   Good for you, and good for me.   Why shovel shit on me for no reason? Who you working for? What agenda you have?  How are you helping hip hop by doing that?   I do my best on every track.  I go hard on every record.   But you wanna go on TV and radio and what have you, and say ""Yeah Canibus was this and Canibus was that"" for no reason!     14 years ago.  Why you don't talk about what we did on C of Tranquility.  Come on now tell the truth.   Every album I do the best that I can do, the best that circumstances will admit me at that time.  Nobody's perfect, but God damn it if I don't give it everything though, 100 at all times.  And it's as if there is some sort of movement, or some sort of deliberate attempt to always, when it comes to Canibus, that's always bringing up old shit, something from 14, 15 years ago.  Always old shit.  Never what's currently coming out of Canibus's catalogue,  what he's doing currently.  And it's like a deliberate attempt by the media and everybody who got a motherfuckin' microphone in their hand and five minutes to do a little video bite to talk about old shit when my name come up.  Cause it's always comin' up somewhere.  It's always comin' up.  And to combat that pressure niggas is talkin' about old shit instead of what most recently came out. Talk about the Magick album and what was being said on that album.  Talk about C of Tranquility and the topics and subject matter touched on that.  Talk about something that relevant to now.   Don't bring up some old shit that ain't got nothing to do with nothing.  Come on now. You know what you doing.  Ran that baton for so far, man.  You ain't never supposed to say something foul about the kid man.   How does that help you?  The irony about it is, that you smilin' talkin over it. It's bad for me but you smiling though. And when I get a little uptight about it, say something about it, everybody look at me like I'm out of bounds, and I'm out of bounds.  You the one that's smiling, lying. You already knew!  And when I say aight, tell the truth.  Tell the truth what happened.  Tell them niggas you was the one who was late to the studio, every day you was late.  Come on now tell the motherfuckin' truth man, tell the truth.  It's like you didn't want to do the record

Through the dark with some tough ass Iditarod dogs
Coattails following a frozen cold trail
Because the photographer bailed there's no details
Real-time awareness, without clarity people get careless
Nobody was prepared for this
After the advent of wireless charging
All sockets no longer wanted, everything was plugged in before this
Back to them again: Tesla, Maxwell and Edison
I know what it feels like to be one of them
I'm from the days when a thoroughbred horse
Could outrun a Model T Ford on a soft-top racecourse
The future is now, Rip The Robot computer style
His voice is no longer unusually loud
Rip The Reptilian, Zimmerman, Rip the Zeta Reticulan
Branch Davidian, Insectoid citizen
The low-hanging branch with the fruit gets picked first
A young boy walking on the street gets strip searched
Why do divine beings treat slaves so bad?
Why do divine beings even have slaves man?

So many scars all over the God

Nobody got jawed, nobody at all

Then ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors
Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
We ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors

What if you talk to your shadow n ya' shadow talks back?
Why is your shadow wearing a tin foil hat?
Don't have any plans, don't wanna give tragedy a chance
So you pray on knees and hands and follow they commands
The Land of the monitored Free, Home of the monitored Brave
In other words we're all monitored Slaves
And for today we're gonna dig graves in the rain
Let's sing and praise and try to remember much happier days
Yeah Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
We ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors
Dismissive kisses, from pretty ass vampire bitches
Resist it, or end up with windpipe stitches
The reaction, breathless aghast, what an extraordinary ass?
That's why the men volunteer so fast
They've got 1 million laws you only gotta break one
To end up in a cell with Tarnush and his Sons
Hard knocks don't have weak spots, it's 2019
The beginning of a brand new epoch
Global currency swap, waffle twat just chartered a yacht
He bought it with stocks and bonds in a box
When they can't afford to choose but budget is not a problem
If they can't decide which one they want they buy all of 'em
Intruder detection, they own private musical section
Exercise equipment, two more stretches
Batman Catamaran, somersault splash
Exciting as a hundred yard football pass
Beer cans clams and smiles, big titty starboard style
You really feel like an artist now

Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
We ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors
Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
Then ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors
Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
We ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors
Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
Then ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors

The man from Somerton beach, police fingerprinted his feet
His face was calm, his clothes was neat
Was it yellow jacket or white magic aka white hats tricks?
Some say they won't do jack shit
Time will tell how scientists designed the bell
From the instructions that they discovered behind the veil
Blurred vision, thoughts get foggy, nightmares, extreme lethargy
Pet doggies with cerebral palsy
Barkin' at my face paint, facial recognition deterrent
Real ID permit, FEMA camp insurance
Sentenced to hell, after the verdict I had to work on the furnace
I charged extra for the warranty purchase
Dial 1-800-411-PAIN, give 'em your name
You get paid? you can keep the change
Re-gentrificate, send 'em to space, what a waste
The human race should never talk about confusion of face
Cause after they cull the herds
The suburbs'll just be a buzzword patrolled by tough nerds with plush furs
Turn key rappers, biochip internet access
Carbon tax credit benefactors forever laughing
At the frozen moisture, succulent boiling oysters
Immediate obedience to orders
Lunar operators have sworn to avoid human confrontation
To depopulate a stupid population

Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
Then ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors
Full Spectrum Dominance, that's what we asked for
We ended up on the wrong side of the blast doors

Benny Riley,Hip-Hop for $ale,2005,"DJ's, cuttin up beats and stuff like that and
That was my first exposure to the whole, artistry in hip-hop
There is nothing in this music, that I don't wanna hear
There is words, that are kind of syncopated and rhythmic
And there's this hot drum track, it's great!

""This is, this is great!  This is, this is great!""
And I could hear, this enormous
""This is, this is great!  This is, this is great!""
This is music, I've been waiting all my life to hear

Aiyyo!  I don't give a fuck, if you gettin some cash
Or gettin some ass, if I was there I'd pick up the tab
Talk to a rag, tell you to wipe your stinkin ass
Get back to the lab, make sure hip-hop last
Through death or dishonor, I do this cause I wanna
Your body armor don't protect you from your karma
I'm ready for the encounter like a titty bar bouncer
Or Muhammad at the Mini-Mart counter with four-pounders
Quick Draw McGraw spitter, let me see your hands jitter
I'll hit'cha where the good Lord split'cha
You faggot-ass niggas are see-through
I treat you like we in the same cell, but I'm Bugsy Siegel
Smack your teeth loose, the street juice
Go to court in cheap suits, givin testimony over beat loops
Take 'em to my hood, show the evil I'm from
They can't blame me for the evil I done, now they see where I run
And why I keep a tight leash on the gun
Why my speech is so revered by the young, cause my spirit is young
A nigga spittin LIKE THAT, got SERIOUS LUNGS
Yo I'm serious SON, he a FURIOUS ONE!


Yo, the name Benny Riley
, the trip took twenty-eight days
From New York to Cali, drivin through alleys
My mom mad at me, my dad laughs at me
My life's a track meet, I need this record deal
Precious, she got the freshest breast-es, and the ass from heaven
36-24-37
She the second broad I ever humped, under a bridge
But she the first broad I ever fucked with in the record biz
Desi told her I was crazy and she called the feds
The bitch didn't know any better, I let her live
She don't know Desi is a greasy fuckin pig
And he's settin me up for somethin he knows I never did
When I see him I'ma put the Smith & Wesson to his head
To change his outlook on life
Maybe I'd show him what it's like to be DEAD
Like the way I look at lyrics, I kill it 'til they DEAD
It's that vivid; got skills to kill the rap business
Got bills to put a contract on the witness if he rat-snitchin
You niggas in the back, thinkin holds 'til your next actin role
Get buried wit'cha cash and gold
Acts that sold, family of Marlon Brando broke
Shattered hopes, rappers choked, took it like a man though
Benny Riley is the closest thing to Canibus yo
Niggas just don't be understandin his flow, until the hammer let go
Grab the mic and cold damage the show
Get split with bananas, flows of the Canibus blow

And I didn't know it",https://genius.com/Canibus-benny-riley-lyrics
Gone In 60 Seconds,"MicClub Mixtape Master, Vol. 1",UnKnown,"You got less than a minute left to recognize the voice
Take your blindfold off, look at the size of this joint
I see you lookin at the barrel, I'ma get to the point
What the fuck is this I'm hearin 'bout beef wit'cha boy?
Beef with who?  I got my problems to face
Cause it pours when it rains out in Washington state
Behind a hexagonal shaped gate, you can't even relate
Right now I live inside a base
Inside the beast, watch how I move and speak
There's military police on every street
Life is shit, I taste it in the food I eat
Motherfuckers be amazed by how cool I keep
I don't get depressed, I get the vest
You still don't recognize the voice, you got 20 seconds left
Dawg, my team is small, but you can still look
To the left of your head and see a red beam on the wall
Firepower so awesome, when the barrel is barkin
I lean forward to keep from fallin
My gun's got grenade launchers on the bottom
Keep talkin, you'll be restin as pieces in a coffin",https://genius.com/Canibus-gone-in-60-seconds-lyrics
Stop Smokin’,C! True Hollywood Stories,2001,"He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me,(Well he if he love you then tell him to stop)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (Come on bitch, he love that rock)
He love me,(Well he if he love you then tell him to stop)

You ever came home everything ya owned was gone
TV, VCR, fridge and phone
Emporio Armani, Bulgari cologne
That nice China set from your mother-in-law
Ya say to yourself ""How could I get robbed?""
The guard dog would've bit somebody for sure
Could it be somebody that you probably know
Got the ABT code and the keys to the door, no
You better think again gullable ho
Somebody you know was on a rob patrol

And I seen em' pull up in a Pinto
I couldn't believe, eyes peekin' through the window
Ain't y'all engaged, well that day he was with the neighborhood bimbo
I thought to myself, OH!
Why would he a need a credit card to get in for
You keep a set of keys under the mat
He ain't thinkin' of that, he stealin' for crack
On the street he can get a hundred for that
I hope you don't really think he bringin' it back
I'm tellin' ya girl he stole it
He was standin' around the last time I saw it
I remember when you bought it
That son of a bitch got balls if he can pawn it
I remember when I seen him this morning
He pulled me to the side asked me if I want it
I had to look real close for a moment
I was shocked when I seen it was your shit
He put it away cause he somebody was comin' and just took off runnin'
I told ya woman, he love that rock

I remember when I met him two years ago
At the Texaco, I was checkin' though
He impressed me though, he was enchanting though
He ain't have no dough but he was sexy though
At first I played hard to get though
But it got so good I had to let it go
It was one to four, put it on me slow
Even asked me to marry him in Mexico
I can't explain how he made me feel
I was head over heels, in love for real
I took him home so he could meet my dad
Took care of his ass, gave him all my cash
For a year and a half I treated him good
He said he needed space, I understood
He be out all night, what seems for days
Then he showed up crazed and he needed to shave
Smellin' like rotten eggs, I'd tell him to bathe
Clean him up, take him to church and get him saved
In Jesus' name I can make him change
If I would've lost my way he would've done the same
Cause he love me


I'm tellin' ya he ain't gonna stop, stop
And he just love that rock, rock
Kid run up in ya crib like knock, knock
Take everything that cha' got, got
Gold watch, watch jewelry box, box
The go straight to the pawn shop, shop
He's ridin' that white horse, horse
And he don't wanna get off, off
I got a 800 number you can call, call
Cause that love y'all had is lost, lost
He don't love you he love that rock",https://genius.com/Canibus-stop-smokin-lyrics

I Can - U Can’t,The Brainstream EP,UnKnown,"Can-I-Bus, ripping them
Forty-four curriculum syllabus caliber killing them nigga

Y'all niggas want to fuck with the illest, you can't
Y'all niggas want to talk about lyrics, you can't
Watch me take it over the limit, cause I gets busy as a motherfucker
Give me a minute
Y'all niggas want to fuck with the illest, you can't
Y'all niggas want to talk about lyrics, you can't
Watch me take it over the limit, cause I gets busy as a motherfucker
Just give me a minute

Yo
This is cannibal rap, Canibus cancels your stats
My vandals in black'll take a hammer to your motherfucking plaque
A Mack eleven when I'm clapping a rap
You can't battle that, your fans need to understand the facts
You ain't even got the balls to rock on the track
If you do, then do the damn thing
And call your man back
I treat you like a lab-rat, and shove a cactus up your ass crack
Stop the bleeding with a Tampax
In fact, you're so vain you probably think this rhyme is about you
But really, nigga, I'm doing better than without you
Lyrically, I'm a mouthful, throw blows too low to crouch too
Pick a mic up and joust you
Brainstream in the cranium, lyrical arithmo mania
The creator of a greater sum
Updated lungs were created by the pyramid builders
With silvers injectors, equipped with K.N.N. filters
To keep out the filth and the dust, when I bust, you hush
Or I just sh-sh-shit you and flush
You want Hip-Hop? Then yo, Canibus is a must
Give a fuck if the shit flop, nigga, I still bust
For real, I don't complain, I don't explain
Been profane before I had a name in the game
I spit a verse, delete out the curses
Reverse it, and verse it, write it out in cursive
I don't have to learn it, so if you want to teach then teach
But don't preach, if you got something to say, speak but don't reach
Yo, tell me what your problem is, why you mad at me?
What's the big tragedy? Why you want to battle me?
You the one with all the dough up in all the magazines
Every time I look, your ugly ass is on the screen
So what's the fascination with me?
Rhymes aside, I'm a small fry, waiting for a little mic time
Yo, all I do is write rhymes
If a nigga, disrespect my mic, he disrespecting my pride
I beat you and beat you, 'till I defeat you
If you beat me, then I'll regroup
'Till the beef is on the meat-hook
'Till the gas bleed from the juke
And rap music is read in my book
Curriculum carpet bombing leave the street shook
If you want to get at Canibus, nigga, get in line
The best rapper in the world reserves the right to decline

Y'all niggas want to fuck with the illest, you can't
Y'all niggas want to talk about lyrics, you can't
Watch me take it over the limit, cause I gets busy as a motherfucker
Just give me a minute
Y'all niggas want to fuck with the illest, you can't
Y'all niggas want to talk about lyrics, you can't
Watch me take it over the limit, cause I gets busy as a motherfucker
Just give me a minute

Yeah, it's the lyrical landmine
Got you motherfuckers on stand by
Yo, Can-I-Bus? C.A.N.I.B.U.S
You know I'm the best
Yeah, one time when we emcee

Harry Fox Hates Hip Hop,UnKnown,2012,"My nigga said, ""Speak on it, throw a slow tempo beat on it,""
He said, ""Real Hip Hop gonna feed off it.""
Call in sick to the beef meat market come back with peace offering
No man is a island, no man is sovereign
Any artist, could turn a garden to a desert
But can he turn a desert to a garden?
These haters hating my bars, playing they part
The illest alive, it ain't my fault, where do I start?
My words always go unheard, my voice is ignored
Nobody will ever understand 10,000 bars
I don't even understand it myself
7 billion people on the planet, not 1 understands how I felt
I feel like Sophia Stewart, the male oracle of rap music
I've been through implorable abuses
Let me explain something called mechanical royalty
A certain amount of albums get pressed up quarterly
For every unit that's pressed, they owe me a dollar
Father Author Poor Pauper, they called me a ?????
On a corner drinking Goldschlager, it's not something that I'm proud of
The business is corrupt and dishonest
It's a law not a promise
Distributors supposed to pay each artist a dollar per album per project
After mechanical royalty is confirmed
Copyright infringement is the next lesson to learn
The writer is the copyright holder, in my case I'm the owner
Without a signature you're not supposed to, sell my music but they sold it
A quarter million dollar fine and five months in prison, hold up!
How many songs you wrote Bus?
I wrote one thousand five hundred, 
ASCAP don't lie about the numbers
But my account got shut down I got no referral
From 
the biggest collection agency in the world
Here we go boys and girls they took everything from me
I wondered if it's cause I'm ugly, or unlucky
I said fuck you crooks you stole my money, keep it gully
They keep playing 
courtroom rugby
I feel like God don't love me
Cause not one person on the planet stepped up to represent me
And now here I am talking to you, but not really though
Cause I know you don't really hear me though
So now I'm sending a message as far as it could go
In the hope that it could maybe reach an uncorrupt soul
""Somewhere over the rainbow,"" I go through pain they'll never know
That's why I'm so miserable, yo
Turn into the lyrical Hulk, jump the gate, grab you by the throat
I should break your fuckin' neck cause I'm broke
But I ain't really on it like that, I'm so important to rap
One day I'll get a lawyer to do that
For now evil wins overwhelming the people with sin
The modern day Djinn with medieval grins
The Jim Baker jungle gym, drink gin and jump into him
Then jump into them, then jump back to gin
I don't want no money, I just want justice
But nowadays no one gives a fuck so fuck it!
You gotta love it big business big budget
Harry Fox hates Hip Hop I'm going public!

Ey yo 5'9""
You must be out your rabbit ass mind
For real or what?
I'm finna get some, ya'll nigga line up
'Fore it's over ima show you what it is
Imma show you why they kicked me out the biz
Them niggas ain't trying to let me live
I ain't gonna end up like Pac and Big

What are you a lyrical body part?
Starstruck over the bodies, U-God
With pajamas on, what the fuck you rhymin' for?
Fee-fi-fo-fum, the forty ton dinosaur with smoky lungs
Nigga where you know me from?!
Thoroughbred Hip-Hop head
Hip-Hop ain't shit without knowin' the ledge
That's what the GOD said
I smoke barley green, turn into Charlie Sheen
Fuck the honor roll if Hip-Hop don't want to honor me
Jump off the deep end, give me the beat man!
I'm twelve albums deep, you just gettin' your feet wet
Beast from the East Bis never been beat yet
You can't avoid war without peace and respect
Listen, I don't wanna rub it in, you actin' like that's your husband
But this is mutual assured destruction
Look up, you see the space and the stars?
Don't create a facade, your arms are too short to wave at God
The lunar base guard, in a Raveon space pod
I was sent to the planet earth to examinate bars
Determinate whatever contaminates Lyrical Law
Im like Maygoth ragin' in space war with J-Rod
I don't have to play the race card
I just grab the ACOG, aim at your jaw, and tear your face off
First thing in the morning, treat it like a dayjob
Mixin' Johnnie Walker with napalm
I hold your nose, make you open mouth and say aww
The Hip-Hop H-bomb, say sumn', I can't wait to respond
Run up in your dressin' room like Raekwon
You act hard when them videotapes on
'Cause you hate to be wrong
Well let me tell you something, nigga, this is Lyrical Law
A spiritual bomb that can cause physical harm
Twitter beef, naw, you act like a miserable broad
A 360 deal means you gettin' circled by a shark boy
Better beg your pardon, turn into a Horsemen, slaughter him
I'm a Undergod, you too overconfident
So talkin' nigga, 'cause you could all get it
W-A-R, nigga, I'm raw with it
Don't let the alcohol fuck with your short vision
I knock you out of the park, nigga, long distance
I wrote this rhyme in five minutes
I'm like ten Ghostface Killahs and twenty-five GZAs!

Rub a dub dub, Rip The Jacker gets no love
Gotta diss a rap nigga for a buzz
Ritual sacrifice they want blood
But I don't understand what that got to do with the music Cuz'
I don't hate L, I don't care if he fucking trannies or not
All I care about is Hip Hop
I ain't mad at Eminem, I just be responding
To the nigga running his mouth who choose to be my nemesis
Nigga I rap too this old head nigga rap the truth
Rap to the streets, I rap in the booth
Spit from the underground to the skyscraper roofs
On paper I wrote more rhymes than any rap group
Tell me why I just can't get on a track with Jeezy nigga
I know how to get them thangs ??? you heard?
What's goodie nigga? Still on deck
The leprechaun lexicon from U.S. Congress
Got a chopper in the car, God-body how I talk it
Got dogs on the carpet, G's at the flea market
Better back it up nigga 'fore I park it

""You wanna face lift? This is what it takes 'Bis
A beat that'll make a nigga think an earthquake hit""
The blue-collar rapper, enigmatic, democratic
Rap-savvy fanatic that could smash any match-up
High when I wrote this, bring welding goggles to my show
My flow glow brighter than any diamond that you know
I walk among you, draw energy from you
The Art of Sun-Tzu, he used to bus' too
I'm like a Shaolin monk on crunk
Holding himself up with his thumb on a stump
Get a Hummer for the summer to stunt
And just sit in the front while my lungs become one with a blunt
Futuristic old-schooler, look like JFK Jr. when I suit up
Jacob 'The Jeweler' with an new cut
Can-I-Bus! I ain't got what I want yet
How could you respect one of the best
What, I can't get no
Grab the mic, nigga, let's go
Bet me who got the best flow
You end up with less doe
Open your vest, let your chest show
I'ma open your chest, let your breath go with a .38 Special
Keep it on the low, don't let the press know
Behind the scenes they put me on death row and won't let go
Brace yourself while I break the chains
My beats bang so hard they erase the plains

The Hundred Bar Monster spit without hawkin' up
Smash your whole roster, fuck what it cost ya'
Fuck what it cost me, join the army smoke Bob Marley
The sergeant major honorably discharged me
For my sinsemilla and my hemp incense
Inspiration, why it's only worth ten percent
Another day in the life for Mr. Can-I-Bus
My life too rough for me not to recognize rough
The soldier's back to blow a fucking hole through rap
I wish they'd let me out the cage and stop holding me back
You might say the only thing holding me back is myself
It ain't hard to tell what's holding me back is my sales
I don't make record for girls, I spit for the borough
But I'm an artist in an ignorant world
World class athlete trained to attack beats
Mixtapes smash the streets, try to patch the leaks
Niggas try to battle me but lose, they got limited views
I remember when I was primitive too
I sit and talk with the inquisitive youth, cause I be spittin' the truth
Sometimes I ask them, ""What you listenin' to?""
Lyrical fitness is the proof, let me put you in the booth
Nottz'll play the beat-loop, let me see what you can do
The older advise the younger when they recognize the hunger
I do a couple reps with the mic to get pumped up
Monkey-bar sit-ups, blood rush to my head
I write rhymes upside-down with an astronaut pen
Spit a hot sixteen at Mach 10, take it up a notch then
Launch everything when I'm locked in
You in the kill-zone boxed in
Tried to play jump rope with skis on and got dropped when you hopped in
The Last Mohican, smoke you in the first season
You don't speak it but it's no secret
Peep it, you lightweight like rice-cakes
Anybody under twenty-one that touch the microphone is mic-bait
Hungry niggas start to get tight-faced, that's when the fight breaks
A sixty second round is a nice pace
Work a nigga out 'til he spit up white paste
Tell him he can hide the bruise on his face with nightshade
If you looking for a battle you came to the right place
This is Mic Club and over here I'm the Mic Ace

I spit rhymes with perfect timing (You could try somethin else)
Yeah you can't stop me from shinin (I'll spit it myself)

I'm on my way to ASCAP so I can pick up my dough
I ran into a Jacker nigga tryna hit me with flows
He didn't know I had a mind to just bloody his nose
And let the blood pour down on his white clothes

Chhhh..
Nigga! You don't wanna cipher with me
My name ain't Pakman for nothin, I'm gobblin emcees
Chhhh..

Damn yo, I wasn't even tryna take it there
Lemme hear somethin in the ear nigga, make it clear
He started goin on about pushin a big Benz
How he stayed jig, and smoked chronic up with his friends
He doin it big and got unlimited ends
I just met the nigga, I seen him walkin up with his mens
Stop frontin shorty, lemme tell you somethin 'bout the game
It's a thin line, from being wack to spittin flames
You gotta represent when you be writin them lines
Don't be a FUCKIN millionaire in every one of ya rhymes
I'mma let you walk in but yo you gotta be quick
I gotta go, and the shit you spittin nigga, better be slick
He started gettin busy, I was noddin my head
Then he fucked it all up and said some shit that I said
Stopped rhymin cuz he knew he shouldn't have said that verse
Lookin stupid as fuck, for that nigga it was the worst
Yo, how you gonna bite and try to be top shelf
Better get ya act together, lemme hear somethin else


I give you more grievance than a nigga possessed by demons
Walkin on ceilings, chasin white lot speedin
Like Tony Soprano, takin meetings
With a psychologist about his emotional feelings
And his crime dealings
He even talked about how to make alcohol out of orange peelings
Pink cookies in a plastic bag gettin crushed by a buildin
Was cool until Canibus puked it
With ill cannibalistic, animal instincts
Instant lyrical fitness, could you handle the distance?
You don't have enough wisdom
The man who gives quicksand resistance
Sinks the quickest, it's simple physics
I get ""Southernplayalistic"" and pimp chicks
Put my big dick in they mouth and smear they lipstick
Come here you stank bitch!
Tell ya man if he don't spit a hundred bars
I'mma bust him in his big lips
Spit quick, like 6B tip-tronic stick-shift
Bitch is equipped with a nitrous-oxide flipswitch
If you hate me, why would you recreate me
With those that imitate me and emulate me?
They talk about me so distastefully lately
But that never break me, they underestimate me
Me and the Killer P, and P-A-C get crazy with G-A-T's
I'm a B-E-A-S-T, you don't wanna race me
I do Mach 1 over a A-F-B
No if's, A-N-D's, or B-U-T's
A hundred bars ain't SHIT for a true emcee
SHUT THE FUCK UP! You should be ashamed of yourself
I ain't heard nothin I felt, lemme hear somethin else",https://genius.com/Canibus-lemmie-hear-sumthin-else-lyrics
Group Home Family,Sprung: Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture,1997,"My dick's like planet Earth, everybody's on it
Used to kick rhymes for free on street corners
Group Home is the name of my organization
We gets busy like phones without call-waiting
Cold killing them, cold blooded reptilian
To rock, none stop, for the millennium
Listen, everyone in my crew be spitting
Eight niggas deep in a Ford Expedition
I rock ice bigger than boulders
My shine be bright enough to give a nigga Glaucoma
Never sober, breaking it down the hardest
The live artists, that beats dead carcass
The C.I.A. wants to murder me ‘cause verbally
I'm a threat to National Security
With the freestyle instinct, we think quick
And set it off like Jada Pinkett",https://genius.com/Canibus-group-home-family-lyrics
Free Words,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"Canibus the continuous, deciduous lyricist
A menace to music that's mastered every style that I spit
A fugitive against the music biz, the damage is punitive
But the truth is that my communitive efforts got 'em pissed!
Silence is golden, a sign that my knowledge is growing
I'ma show 'em, fuck the promotion
These poems open door for the chosen
In these moments of economic erosion
The global economy's broken, cause our leaders control it
They say we owe them but everything that we own has been stolen
So don't be mad at the soldiers, you follow orders too, don't you?
You never make a difference being a voter
The are the controllers, you just a warm blooded promoter
You're just a pea in a pod, with the need to believe in God
But God don't need guns or bombs
You need freedom to be oppressed, knowledge for the intellect
Positive effects what come out of our common respect
All colors, all creeds all kinds, all breeds
One law, one love, if we want world peace
It all starts with being still
But being still long enough to feel but being real enough to follow your will",https://genius.com/Canibus-free-words-lyrics
Bis vs. Rip (Original Version),"MicClub Mixtape Master, Vol. 1",UnKnown,"(Yo Rip {WHAT} come here man, let me talk to you for a 'sec?)
{WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT NIGGA?
(Why you screamin' man?)
{I'M THE ILLEST, I'M THE ILLEST}
(Yo, relax, yo put that down) {YO, DON'T TELL ME..}
{YO, I'LL BEAT YOUR LITTLE SKINNY ASS NIGGA}
(Yo, what the fuck is wrong with you?)
{FUCK YOU!!}

Yo, you fuckin' hate me; you fuckin' lock me in the basement
But you still want me to protect you - it doesn't make sense
Can-I-Bitch - I supported you like a weight bench
Without me you're defenseless you better face it
You ain't show me love when you was at your apex
Gettin' paychecks up at the radio with DMX and Flex
Catchin' wreck while Noreaga was catching his breath
I had to keep the situation in check
Look at the varicose veins in my neck, Germaine is the best
The industry fucked you; I'm just payin' 'em back
What's the matter with slayin' jackers? That's all I've been doin'
Besides talkin' shit I ain't done nothin' to 'em
They just mad cause when I see 'em I don't run up to 'em
Between me and you, yo you know I run right through 'em

Yo, calm down

Who you tellin' to calm down nigga, I'm a Ripper remember?
I told you not to do ""Gone Til November""
But you wouldn't listen; I always had your best interests in mind
I wrote all your best lyrical lines
If it wasn't for me you'd be writin' pitiful lines
On stage if you was tired, I was spittin' sometimes
Nobody knew you bit off my rhymes
I would just be quiet, stand to the side and let that shit ride
But I'm gettin' tired of havin' to remind you Bis
If it wasn't for me nobody would've signed you Bis

C'mon Rip, you a lyin' ass bitch and you know it
Group Home was part my company, I co-owned it
If its one thing I learned in show biz
Stay focused and don't quit Rip
Why you talkin' 'bout old shit?

Germaine, you fuckin' water brain
Don't you understand, fuck the mainstream
You should just call out names
The industry's all about game
I shit on 'em all the same
And I leave spit stains on their brain
Like liquid chocolate spillin' over their new white trainers
Insane is an understatement, I'm Satan
Canibus is amazing; I don't know what the fuck Germaine is
I just know that both of y'all are trying my patience
I don't give a fuck about a beat; I've been rhyming for ages
Rippers are dangerous, all jackers are afraid of us
You wanna face me Bis? Kick a rhyme!

No, that's ridiculous

Aiight then, listen to mine
I jump in a costume impromptu just to rob you
Put the nozzle to your eye ball and tell you what not to do
Rip your tonsils out through your nostrils
Bury you next to shark fossils
Make it impossible to find you
Depths that Jacque Cousteau himself wouldn't dare to dive to
With goggles, oxygen bottles and Doppler effect modules
Lock you in a time capsule, smash the console
Shit on you in reverse and suck you in a brown hole
Suck the power out of your soul
You're nothin' but a coward in the cold freezer with a hour to go
Watching my Casio stop watch, countin' it slow
Like drug lords checkin' to see if it's Talcum or Coke
I can kill you by drownin' the globe
Or I can just spit inside of a hole and put an ounce in your throat
In battles I'm a thousand to no, I silenced the Pope
Do you know how many rhymes I've economically grossed?
No? I thought so, neither do I
It's a dick between your mother's thighs divided by pi
I'm the sickest linguistically, illicit lyrical misfit in the business
And probably in existence, what's your consensus?
Study my own syntax statistics since '96
With CPA certified assistance
I made a decision that my standards are above precision
The only thing I can honestly say I love more than women
Are dope writtens, if it ain't dope then don't spit it
Don't be sensitive and get on the defensive
Just practice your penmanship
If you can't spit at high temperatures then just quit
Be careful of the tongue it tends to bend to the left
According to manufacture's specs you'll make a mess
And rupture the blood vessels in your neck fuckin' with Rip
Got millions of blueprints on zip disk
Stock versions of sick verses that come with conversion kits
In a course every Thursday that teaches you how to burst like Rip
You never experienced work like this
Nigga welcome to the serpentine world where I twist
The world that I rip, the world that I fixed, the world where I live

Okay Rip you made your point, I can't out-rap you
You said you was the illest, I would never doubt that too
At the moment of truth I let you design the tattoos
You are the illest alive, that's a fact that you proved
Just a couple rappers don't want it to happen for you
Raggin' on you like battlin' is all you can do
You didn't sell enough units to be honest with you
Nobody knows the truth; you got talent out the gazoo
When niggas first heard you it was like ""Man on the Moon""
You got dissed by a legend but you damaged him too
So what if the ladies think he's more handsome than you
What happens if the rumors about being a faggot are true?
Look what it's runnin' into
I don't feel like havin' this discussion with you
I'm tired of fuckin' with you
Niggas in the game don't wanna do nothin' with you
Bussin' with you, going one on one with who?
They wanna get rid of you, shit is too lyrical
Headhunters out to get you, that's why I had to protect you
I wouldn't disrespect you as another intellectual
Without you I'm unsuccessful, God bless you
What makes you think I left you or why I'd ever be tempted to?
Ever since my third album I've been mentionin' you
I got your name on my arm, I'm representin' you
You +Rip the Jacker+ I would never question you
I respect your opinion as a professional nigga
I just want you to listen to what I'm tellin' you
What happened between L and you, forget it
People know you won the battle; they will give you the credit
A lot of people don't want to admit it
But I consider it a real privilege
To bear witness to your lyrics
And be involved in sharing the merits, I'm forever indebted
I just need you to chill for a second so I can send a positive message
Like 2Pac before he left us
The author of the work ethic Genesis
Has inspired me to write the Exodus scripts
As a constant reminder not to forget Bis
But I've reached a precipice
Remember Rip, you can't rhyme forever
There's always somebody with better shit
I keep you out the public eye for a reason
You're a commodity Rip, ain't that how you wanna keep it?
I keep your whereabouts secret
I bring bitches to the crib every weekend so why is you beefin'?

Ayo, stop patronizing me, you despise me
All you wanna do is steal rhymes from me
You constantly keep me behind walls of concrete
Lock me in the basement like a fuckin' zombie
If I was a priority, you'd acknowledge me
You ain't shit neither; you ain't got no college degree
You can't rhyme without me, stop smiling at me
Give me the keys to the garage; I need to borrow the Jeep
Get the fuck out my face nigga!",https://genius.com/Canibus-bis-vs-rip-original-version-lyrics
Make up,Full Spectrum Dominance 3,2019,"It all starts in that chair sitting on the movie set
In a roundabout way - never used to be direct
That bronze glow for men, that Cleopatra tan
In a tent, for that wretch with the low hanging breasts
The tart amazonian clay face on IG Live
With a playmate - looking like grape ape
You found $100 on ya' windshield
You look so pretty, and just this morning you felt so shitty
Double chin? Nah, it’s only just a couple of inch
Just spray it away and go have a wonderful rinse
The operative word is love, never no need for grudge
Come over to the mall kiosk cuz
They got this new mask made from volcano mud
Just use this sqweegy like you dippin' your whip
And your done, if you battle face to face
At least make sure your ya' profile’s straight
In case the pictures surface at a later date
I painted myself silver cause I felt like a superhero
Ahead my time, comic con super weirdo
They couldn't understand it back then
Until they add them 0's to them SAG checks, correct?
What's a zebra without stripes... right?
No answer - I guess that means he's the silent type

After every red cent of the take home pay is spent
Economically makeup doesn't even make sense
Just imagine for one day if it all went away
What would you say? Would you be able to show face?
I happen to like my wrinkles, my blackhead pimple scar tissues
Adds visuals to everything I been thru
I ain't gon be the one to take ya' makeup away
Just cause you wanna’ look 10 years younger today
I’ma be there for you matter what you look like
Muthaphuka like a gotdamn zombie in the light
In life a whores job cost a whores price
You know what they say, you could buy nice or buy twice
They do it for the highlights, they do it for the likes
Personality types do it for the night life hype
Don't be too hard on yourself, just come as you are
And smear a lil contour on the arms of the Lord
For ye shall be sure to remember the days that came after and before
You saw the Full Spectrum Dominance Tour - on four Continents or more
TSA go thru ya’ makeup drawers, you can't take that on the plane anymore
But I really like those colors, especially for sister and brothers
Nieces and nephews - aunties uncles and cousins
The hook says you make me sick, but I love ya'll
Such colorful fans, who could want more?
Makeup for the shorties under 40 is a top priority
For big bottom small top minorities
Old carpet magically altered all you gotta do is steam it and wash it
Use worchester sauce when you wash your armpits
Abs - chest and traps - Wrestle Mania I'm back
Off the top turnbuckle in my fishnet tank
Trending fashions - my balls feel better when my jeans is saggin’
And I'm braggin' and my nuts is dangling
What's the 411 Champion? See this is what happens
When the fans love canibus again, the hook says you make me sick
But I love ya'll, gaga fans standing outside the club ya'll",https://genius.com/Canibus-make-up-lyrics

Get Off Ya Knees!
Change your style cause its time
Nigga's want me to rhyme pre-99
No-one can flow with Bis, Most people know this
But others just won't admit, They can't get over it
Rhymes I been known to spit, Mic's I been known to grip
Makes me the Ultimate, God father over this
I'm just a ghost of rip
A soldier in this show business don't exist if he has no defence
My opponents are so intent, not to show respect
They fret cause I'm a global threat
I'm so hard to catch, a cold with Caleb
I relocate so quick they can't close the net
I expose the press, dispose of the prints
On the loose again nobody knows what's next
My virus infects
Every machine with clandestine speech
Nigga Get Off Ya Knees!
(Hook)

Yeah!
Hip-Hop's habitat, Rip the Jacker's back
This is battle rap, def while I master tracks
I mix ant with thrax in your digestive track
I suggest its wack then I side-step to the back
I kidnap your X, For 10 million franks
Make you shit your pants, you smell like septic tanks
Just respect it man throw a fist in the air
The distance is Near, Armageddon is here
I permeate UN-worldly planes
As they crash in the worlds that trades only my words remain
Altruist Egoist - people are ignorant
What is the meaning of meaningless meaningfulness?
Formulas of primordial audio
40 ohms of euphorial anointed flows
It was written so it shall be told
Get off Ya knees, give me the microphone
Fucker

My man-hood is massive, when it's not flaccid
Bis is real cool when he's not Rip the Jacker
I am modernist, I am complex
Vicarious logic of bodily hardship
Beat your ass till your teeth mash
Sand blast your face blow a breeze past, make you bleed fast
E-K-G's beep fast, Doctors speak fast
For skin graft the patch over deep gash
Give me details, how does meat smell?
After a train derails into a field of gazelles!
Step in the club; turn the crystal in your cups to red blood
Fuck Ya Heads up!

Grab a broom cold smash and loops

Grap a mic and start bustin
Yo its a cold cold world that's what I keep say

The fact is the truth your head is a melon bash the fruit splatter your juice
Picture apple gets axed in two thats you

This goes out to the motherfucker that stole my rhyme book
Let me tell ya what design you took
Ya got a piece of batch 14 article 3
I hope you have a good time its a remarkable read
It can make you marketable indeed
You now got ya hands on the secrets of a master MC
Personalized print extra wide script so my eyes dont squint
My mind thinks smoke rise through the vent
Try to rework the theory but the logic is thin
I possess the body of jin with a fight klub win
Maybe its just a mic club thing fuck a sling
You could duck a swing i spit webs duck one of them
My fingerprints on your soul when I touch a pen
We interact when you memorize the raps
Identify fast syntax applied with stats
When I open my mouth its like sliding back the bolt
No joke leave a hole in you was an insult
You better check the wind direction when I talk
Before and after somewhere in between I blast ya

Mic no matter how wasted I seem yee
Is this what you want?

Yee yo yo I rap that shit when the mic check that shit
Canibus nigga he the best that spit
Fuck the fact that I never had a hit
I don't need it cuz I never met a rapper that I ain't rip
Walk strap wit a mic and a 50 minute DAT for the night
Just incase your show ain't tight
Step on stage and paste left to right
Like a lion ready to bite you dying tonight
More lines to your forehead than Brian McKnight
A thousand volt voice box I'm a fry them tonight
I've been shittin' on site
Meticulousness with the mic takes a mic and rips it
Like a Corbin knife
Lyricist that don't lounge
Break a nigga down
Since you're iced out you can keep the sweating down
Lift you off the ground till your bitch screams
Put him down he's a mic club member now
Beat you wit my braw
Force you to speak loud
Like motherfuckers give me 50 bars right now
Plus another 50 that's not 100
You spit 86 you trying to tell me you can't count
Throw you in the sweat box let you sweat in out
1 2 3 4 1 bar figure it out
You should feel
You maggots aren't ready for the illest rappers
Allied metaphors in this joint active compensative
Comp linens in the rhyme science
Protected by mic club security advisers
Pick the mic up and train
Till my voice becomes number one again on a Marge ton exchange
Too violent to tame
Wolfsbane pump thro my veins
Cuz I never been embraced by the game
Put emcees to shame
With the lyrical linguist spitting vintage colonial English
Like who art thou, bow to the 10 inch dick suck on it
I'm the aflame of this shit
From the king of the past bringing it back
Tell the queen of the pride to come sit on my lap
Her body is spotless she ain't got one scratch
So you could keep them other ugly bitches in the back

Niggas want to bust like the Canibus on the mic but
They can't bust like the Canibus can

You got a video out?
You got a platinum LP?

I just came for free

Alright Bis

Where's he been?

Damn girl look at you now, huhh
On T.V
With that pretty smile, huhh
Truth is I miss you and I wanna tell ya
But I ain't got no numbers, email, or nothing
You know I seen you at the Bad Boy for life shoot
You was wearing a tight light blue Nike suit
I remember when I connected eyes with you
You winked at me, I thought that was really nice of you
I remember once staying up all night with you
Writing with you, talking bout life with you, it was exciting too
I'm assuming you did the same cause you cared
Girl, don't you remember all the laughter we shared
We used to talk about why Pras failed so bad
And why the hell Wyclef's breath smells so bad
Okay, I know I don't need to tell em all that
But we was kinda feelin each other, you can't deny that
We worked on records together, you murdered them tracks
I think it was sexy how you said the verses like that
You said, ""Free be the one rockin shyt, special operative, specialize any
Weapon diagnostic""
Just thinkin about it got me souped up
I wanna hug you in your birthday suit, what
Damn, this record is getting out of hand

Right Now,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"(Canibus)
This is a new season with new rhymes for the same reason
The public needs it but without faith they won't believe it
We cursed since birth, imprisoned by these Earth demons
My verse is written in secret, then released in pieces
The sting of rejection, the sour sensation of perfection
It's connected to our spiritual ascension
Start with yourself, you are your only contender
The game of life has no winners, therefore we surrender
(Chorus: Canibus)
Write now! Write your thoughts down, now! Recite them out loud, now!
The bright light bleeds down through the dark clouds, now!
Right Now brothers, now! Right Now sisters, now!
Right Now people, now! Right Now Rippers!
(Canibus)
The rhyme is my religion, the rhythm is alive, listen
And bear witness, try to share my vision
My vision of my soul inside Sol, free the globe
Inside a globe with two poles, Ouroboros in my poems
Bestowed by a poet, what do you know and when did you know it?
Obey the law with its fundamentally flawed components
Omit this, admit this a myth 'til I spit

From half way tree the spanish John Rowe I got it sold the Canibus is indestructible
Yo, I be the indestructible thug
The type to draw first blood wit eight-ounce gloves
If you want it, you can get it, so when you can't disarm it don't set it
The bomb'll blow if you tamper wit it
I'm analytic, so run for cover when I kick it
Lyrics'll fly like a bullet when the hammer hit it
While you niggas is babblin', my lyrics is travellin'
Like a javelin, to stab you in the abdomen
Acronyms and nouns, predicates and adjectives, you can't fuck wit the Canibus
You catch damages beyond repair
My rhymes smash through the booth window to strike the engineer
I can maintain thresholds of pain
And walk across the sun barefoot lookin' for shade
I re-arrange your ribcage like a twelve-gauge at close range
Change the position of your brain
Hard raps penetrate through your hard-hats and all that, kid
Get'cha wig peeled back
I scalp you like the indians on horseback
Runnin' bull will hit you harder than running back
Stunning man with brave and cunning raps
Swiftly running laps around forty-eight tracks
Like uncut crack, fiends keep coming back
Heads is flippin' like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analogue tapes to digital DATS
It's critical black, the Canibus is ill like that",https://genius.com/Canibus-indestructable-lyrics

Sit it down at the mixing board, I was told in a dream
One day I would be redeemed, conscious, understand what I mean
A dose of , my pupils, eyes increase
My higher self filter in between, playground for the supreme
This is not fantasy, this is manifest reality
You must control how to channel it, strategy
Light as a feather, density, fourth dimensional energy
Fifth dimensional memories, hyper dimensional weaponry
Battle me for an infinite salary, following flattery
Serious savagery, couldn't pick a more impossible fantasy
Psyche, religious from a alchemist chemistry
Incendiary vocabulary illuminated speech and wizardry
Every single living soul is a mirror of who I am physically
Theoretically, inseparable, incredible
I am fifty  cycles of matter perpetually
Each time perfectly, what does the future hold?

I energize the rap community, enter your mind
Eternity on , stab you with electricity
I'm trapped in my gravity, and positive polarity
I only care about infinity (infinity)
Merely a vessel that the entity channels strength to vitality

How the Story Goes,The C of Tranquility Demo,2008,"The rhymes that I write are not finite
But visual computer bytes from satellites under lunar twilight
Zoom to your facial features, put your face on ice
I've been waiting for this fight since the blade was on the knife
The less that we thought, the more that we fought
Harden our hearts, but your pain will not soften my response
We fight for greed, not for god, this fight feels wrong
So how long 'til we fight no more?
Patriotism starts with the need to defend
To Serve and Protect what you love from a threat
We naturally progress in steps towards death
Sometimes from loss of life, sacrifice and regret
Conquests begets nightmares and always stress
I still weep for those who have not yet wept
By all means tell the truth, but tell it with a slant
Tell it from behind the gates of a Concentration Camp
Can-I-Bus? No!! Not now you can't
Understand? Megalodon Man wants to have a word with you fam'
Time signatures change, words appear not to be the same
Yes, it sounds insane, but it's just Germaine
Picture the human brain tryna map recognizable patterns
With unrecognisable raps with sizeable subject matter
Avoid the white noise, cut through the chatter
The Mic' Grappler Hip Hop track thrasher, I am the master of all rappers
Evolution of our species, ahh, speak please
Now we are speaking at different frequencies
Which style do I deploy, depends on who you talk to
Every album is different, this is just a walk through
Fronting on the God, remember what I taught you
The weak hearted always want piggy back off you
Shipwrecked in time suspended in the form of a rhyme
At the most unfortunate times
Spitbox International close quarter Hip Hop battle groups
Where and when can I battle you?!
To present you with a certificate that states you are fit to spit
How long you think it took to rhyme like this?
I stand still and emotionless, in this moment of disgust
Wondering who the fuck can I trust
Us?! What do they mean by Us?
United by One Mind, but divided by blood
Sharpshooter Canibus gon' bust when he have to
But why do he have to? That's what I wanna ask you
People going at you, the people going at you
This is unnatural, I rap for the youth
Poetic presided speaker, may I see your masterpiece research?
It's not ready, it's an incomplete verse
As my thoughts begin to calm, the evil nature of the song
Rip The Jacker loved by many, but hated by them all
I've been repping Hip Hop since I was 10 years old
AND YOU ALL KNOW HOW THE STORY GOES!!!!!!
My Adidas have 3 stripes and white shell-toes
AND YOU ALL KNOW HOW THE STORY GOES!!!!!!
Got paid to hustle, got paid to flow
AND YOU ALL KNOW HOW THE STORY GOES!!!!!!

SuperLuminal Travel,Rip the Jacker: Evidence of Infinity 3,UnKnown,"(Verse 1)
Looking skyward calculating 2012
The global system will be in alignment
The arrival of the prophet commander complex in a starship
Looking for a place to park it
They detane anonymous hackers for fighting federal contractors
Cause they looking like androgynous rappers
I chase em entrap em detail in the action
For try to desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master
Fast acting bio hazard my verses a surface burst blasting
James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon
Systematic global geographic systemic neosynapses
Beyond the absence of light is all blackness
The ships are metallic the engines are magnets
The motors the magic
I build the sliver disc in a cabin
In the labyrinth of the enchanted
Where air quality is unbearably rancid
From a ripper slasher slashing all you fucking fagots
(Hook)
Superluminal Travel 3x
Faster than the speed of light
Superluminal Travel 3x
Glowing all through the night
Superluminal Travel 3x
From point A to point C
Superlumainal Travel 3x
Ain't a damn thing faster than me
(Verse 2)
Cog nits of saturation I race to the sun
Than got back before the competition even began
It all started at one now look what we done
Just kick back release little pieces for fun
You couldn't even fly a kit in my airstrip (nooo nigga)
The airspace right there for the league team
You on your last leg don't try to chase me
Motherfucker infinity growing at light speed
(Cut school) tech bone drag em thru I'm connect bones
Rock em from the pressure of the depth
Test calibrated spec weapons check correct
You don't want war with complex
Im the mixing board Optimus Prime
I came here from an advanced time
And help the world discover advance rhymes
Kill a Decepticon with the power of my mind
Then bend the fabric of space and travel a straight line

RTJ2 to infinity
(Verse 3)
The dragon will be delayed a few days during the testing phase
Of the fully automated RTJ
They say the whole world will die
When two atomic mosquitoes collide
Not even the size of a gap fly
Why is eagle eye giving me bad vibes
I was born to rhyme everybody knows this is my pastime
Every bar I record is absorbed by a robot Borg
They make more while I'm out on tour
Do you know the machine monitor me for 30 years
And even suggest the ear wax growing from my dirty ears
Two verses against one not fair Canibus raps everywhere
And right now he's not here
He doesn't care you will not be spared
Rip the robot will hunt all down by the layers
I didn't create it I wrote a little code but they made it
Hows that for a duppy Jamaican
With superluminal spaceship coordinating acoustic levitation
For my RTJ2 geostasis
My tranquility module is so spacious
In exile my only crime is my imagination
Imagination encircles the world
Superb these were not my but Einstein words
My work is highly touted
The mainstream media don't write about it
So why is my laboratory so crowded
I know where to turn trust no one comes from
You can't unlearn what can not be undone
I tell you what its about and you don't have enough appendages
To count how many times they never let it out
First of all UFOs are not even real
And if they were they wouldn't be shaped like wheels
How can they be coming out hollow earth of the ocean
When publicly there isn't prove of there propulsion
My superluminal user-friendly computer is irrefutable
Who the hell you want me to prove it to
Aliens in absentia on a ten thousand bar adventure
Too many album songs to mention
Its inherently natural to smoke trees in a space capsule
Right before superluminal travel
My radar range radical is behaving irrational
I manually self correct my longitude and latitude
Payload heavy steady tell Santa Claus Canibus ready
To start searching for SETI
Extraterrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battle rip the jacker to infinity

Faster than the speed of light (Complex killers)

What You Lookin’ For,The Vitruvian Man (Mixtape),2005,"(Canibus)
I got this beat from Riggs, yeah I got it from Riggs
Cause in a minute I'ma be on top of the biz
Try to act like you don't know who it is
Around the globe there's kids that play the ""Canibus Quotable Quiz""
It's like if you ain't a mogul they don't know who you is
But I'm a ogre in the biz with the vocals and libs
Said so much crazy shit on my last album
My name shut Interpol down for two hours
Now that's true power
I create what I can't counter rhyming for my anger-management counselor
Just listen to the vibes and blend in with the signal you getting
Can you hear me now? Answer the question
You want to talk about sick poems? I spit stones
Leave you split holmes, tie knots with your rib bones
Quick blow break off your limp wrist bones
Make you scream melodies in twelve different ringtones
I can speak Chinese, ching-chong, get off the ding-dong
Knock your ass over the table like little ping-pongs
You got balls? Bring 'em on
I'll smash 'em with a spiked bat like Raekwon with Cuban Linx on
Blink and you gone, let off more shells than shrimp farms
Spit raw, your face look like you smelled a stink-bomb
You ain't dreaming, nigga, pinch your arm
Canibus be spitting bars that could dislodge Kanye's jaws

What you looking for? We hooking off
Punchlines on the song through the hook and all
You acting like you think you too good to fall
You spit with a glass-jaw, get up, give it more
(Canibus)
If I was focused I could crush you
Cause you saying you focused, then how come I could still touch you?
I bust you, then spit some Young Buck shit at you
Cause I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two
My little arms carry big arms
To tickle the clit, finger keep the sink warm when I bring harm
I'll have a nigga screaming for his momma
Your body armour don't protect you from your karma
Come along with me, let me see what you got
Battle you on the spot, show you how nice you not
I'm the champ like Ali, you just a close copy
When people see you they don't know that it's not me
I flow cause I got to, the shit sound hot cause it's not you
Try to catch me but I got you
I got a mind that spins like belt drives
And when I seen Hip-Hop die I felt cries
But I got an idea to bring it back to life
Bring me back to the mic, make sure you package it right
I'll go all-out, pour my heart out, mix it around
Put my voice to these beats let it mix with the sound",https://genius.com/Canibus-what-you-lookin-for-lyrics
U Don’t Cee,"MicClub Mixtape Master, Vol. 1",UnKnown,"It's the capital C, little A-N-I, capital B, U-S, whattup G
Even from a distance I got a front row seat
And I'm watchin what y'all don't see
Listen up kids
Your favorite artists are mafia bosses
From the streets to the corporate office of they lawyers
Niggas got money and then they got hungry
Got friends in powerful places just like Bugsy, but more ugly
It's gon' get bloody, niggas don't know
The side of the street shit the TV don't show
Tour buses full of weed and coke, gettin a hundred G's a show
These niggas got cheese to blow
On the phone, governor hits, gotta hide they mothers and kids
Talkin in code, watchin out for the feds
Every day they address change
Hoppin out of bombproof automobiles, from real jet planes
The mainstream think they just rappin
They don't have the eyes or ears to see or hear what's happenin
I'm from an island where the skinny niggas ride
It's an island where the real skinny niggas die
Ask my nigga Spragga Benz, he'll tell you why
We represent Jamaican pride
It's a war bein fought on all levels, let me paint the picture
It's the straights against the gays, but the gays is richer
There's a lot of sexy beasts in the system that like men more than women
Cause they spent so much time in the prison
I can tell you what it is and what it isn't, this shit is subliminal
Can't see it without the criminal vision
Motherfuckers is livin a life nobody ain't filmin
Thug TV, and it ain't for children
Guns, sex, money and drugs, fuck your feelings
Feds puttin smoke detectors with bugs in ceilings
Niggas hirin they own law enforcement
Goin to court bent, dollars be talkin, drop the charges
Don't forget, that nigga Shyne comin home soon
And I know he hungry, I wonder what he gon' do
If you can hear me cousin, I got my money on you
What niggas sayin in the streets is true, see you soon
We can do somethin with Spragga B or Elephant Man
When you come home, you see my shit is militant man
I just came back from Belize, my uncle got married
To this drug lord's niece, and bought a 36 karat marquis
I'll holla at you, we'll discuss the plan
I'm a soldier but I squeeze with a delicate hand
The 50 cal cost fifteen thou'
And I ain't stupid enough to say I got one, you figure it out
It's a lot of nosy niggas around
That's why I moved the fuck out of New York to a less busier town
With a 9 to 5, I still experience life on the finer side
Hollerin ride or die
Man of flesh with the eyes of God
A concrete bunker protects my mind so I cry inside
While I watch how the media designed the lies
But real niggas see eye to eye
While fake niggas run around lookin for another ride to buy
With they lawyers co-signin the crime, I rhyme like
There's a hundred million dollars on the line every time
I'm ready to place a bet any time
Empty a whole nine into any shield you hide behind
To breach your contract with Father Time
Just an old problem in the modern world, you see how these niggas
Is thorough from borough to borough, I'll give you referrals
7-1-8, 3-6-0, 2-5-1
Send the last digit on a bullet through a barrel
My hundred pound rucksack full of ammo and army apparel
If a nigga REALLY wanna battle",https://genius.com/Canibus-u-dont-cee-lyrics
Speaker Creatures,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I was born in Jamaica, reincarnated by the Creator
I crawled out of a meteorite crater
Bat-shit crazy, I feel like Hip Hop hate me
They erased me & my sanity escaped me
Sumerian, Israelian, mammalian mixed with alien
From the constellation of Aquarius
The logo was branded on the back of the savage
Who demanded your daughter's hand in marriage for sex magic
The light glows on the Agate, rock in the cabin
She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric
The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot
He's also her best friend who pretends to be a faggot
Next passage: death is a language, I'm Hannibal Lecter
Coronating metaphors with my sword and scepter
I was never the best, just corrupted by the weight of success
Could've been more productive with less breath
I translate codes, animate ones and zeroes
To sideways 8 'til something great unfolds
These are the Psalms unknown, reborn to the bone, it feels wrong
Look at these rags I have worn
Burn Hollywood Burn, they tried to trick them
I've probably 'Spit a Billion' bars before this one
Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night
I memorize the movements of the lights
Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart of the Sephiroth sloth
That can make you bleed thoughts
So be advised, my rhymes override the mind
But you'll be fine after average recovery time
I'm heavyweight slim face, I breathe when the wind breaks
Breast plates move when I give chase
Jumped the boundary like Space Jam, wait till I get up in your base camp
You gon' have to face the champ
Roman shield is composed of a rose colored stone
My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones
The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot
If the target ever stands in one spot
Tentacles form a loose noose, hang your ass off of the roof
Suffocate you 'til you mourn for a truce
Introduce you to my people, stick you with some needles
Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles
Go to sleep people, I'll watch why they feed off your evil
And meet you in the motherfucking 'C'-Quel

You  that God is dead
You  that God is dead
This is the end of days
This is the end of days",https://genius.com/Canibus-speaker-creatures-lyrics
Your Irish Accent,UnKnown,2012,"Those of you who fail to prepare, well now you must prepare to fail
It doesn't matter what your desire entails
I sit around the table with me ale
As I sip from the grail, ""Barkeeper bring another pale""
Here's a gold coin and some wisdom for you little girls and boys
Rip the Jacker's coming out of that void
And when he arrives you're going to see the fire in his eyes
He will help you uncover all of the lies
The lies that were told and spread across the globe
To enslave mankind until the end of time
The leprechaun carrying his own megagrammaton
Megalodon transforming words with his energon
There's no substitute for it, indeed he is one of a kind
Rip the Jacker and his Infinite Rhyme

Nineteen planets and 38 moons
A tabernacle room with 38 tombs
Lazor beam rap flow, shove this J.O.B
Take this anti-cathode and shove it down your rat hole
You dirty, stinking, disgusting crackhead troll
You ain't shit, how many raps you wrote?
You sit there on a computer and doodle, rhyming noodles with goo-goo
You ostracised anybody that knew you
As the world turns daily, they use you
Fast talk and lose you, you waiting for that ___ on YouTube
You now rocking with the best, best, best
I put Rap to the test, test
Canibus the rapper, the vet, Rip the Jacker the master, the myth
Experimenting with the Backster effect
Naturally they water me, I grow, they irritate me, I explode
A dozen albums deep why is that a joke?
From Apollo 11 to moon base 12
I transport you from Hell on Earth to space Hell
I speak at frequencies frequently speaking, Translate the Phoenician
Heart beat increasing, the translator starts wheezing
Analytically speaking
Ten million bars of lithium depletion is the reason I beat him
To advertise is not wise, these wack niggas bite my rhymes
Waste time and compromise lives
The consequence of my belief system, nah G you tripping
They don't even understand what you spitting
Trial prep possess style in depth
I'm 10,000 rhymes and running and I ain't even freestyled yet
Full capability prototype, the pop killer poltergeist
I rap for real, you post on a site
Tell my why you ignore it, try it, you'd probably enjoy it
What's the point if you dying to avoid it?
I quantum leap into the beat
10,000 molecules meet, this ain't for the average MC
Memories of the future, penalties of the past
The righteous will never venture down that path

The rough cold holds of the grumpy old man
He exists beyond machines, dreams and programs
The NWO plans you stand for they physical scam
They sold they soul, now they wanna go H.A.M
I'm protected by the blood of the lamb
They running for they lives covered by the mud of the land
Fuck that, my fans call me a stubborn old man
Lock and load, lick shots until my gun bolt jam
Radio control D.O.D. drones with both hands
Scrambled eggs, raisin toast and a bowl of old bran
I'm the Hip Hop G.O.A.T
I ain't got to prove shit no more cause they know that I am
GrandWizard Master trap you like Alaskan crabbers
Nasty bastard, I smash you in a spam of cabbage
Haters can't stand it, 10,000 bars too much to manage
Motherfuckers can't even understand it
Contact Schrodinger's cat, Canibus the rapper owns rap
Only a handful of people know that
Yeah, I'm writing, rhyming, vocalling and vibing
Dragons watching the Phoenix fly over the horizon
My high altitude EMP eludes hot pursuit
EPMD, Mic Doc in the booth
You talking to me? Nah, I ain't talking to you
Your label treats you like a Hip Hop prostitute
I got juice, dry socks and boots
The industry crucified Hip Hop, 2Pac is proof
I don't know what I don't know, but god-damn-it I know how to flow
And that's all I ever need to show
Speak, spoke a decision you made on your own
The weight of the world versus the weight of your poems
The main area of operations is chosen
Take two teams and call me when you get to the opening
August 11, 1973
Hip Hop done gave birth to the first MC
The master Rip the Jacker, the microphone controller clashing
Slang slashing, I'm shinobi assassin
Irregular programming, thermal scope scanning, holding a cannon
Heat resistant clothes found between your bone fragments
The metaphor tactician, edit chief with the lyrics
Any word that you ever wanted to visit
I rip shows, establish foothold from get-go
Show you how to flow, show you how this rap shit goes
I loved Hip Hop from the beginning, back when it had no limit
Back spinning to new galactic beginnings
I love it, I live it, I wouldn't give it up for a minute
Every minute of spitting they miss hundreds of lyrics",https://genius.com/Canibus-your-irish-accent-lyrics

What?
You wanna battle with a Jesus piece? You need luck
You couldn't see me with a Jacob piece from Jesus
I'll lean you back like your spine just cracked
Rhyme chiropractor, get to adjust raps
Spit something, let me see if I'ma bust back
I front back, I'll go your ass till you collapse
Spin hats around like Sprewell hub-caps
My gun will clap faster than Savion Glover taps
Wave the four at you, if it takes more than that
I'll kick down your door, before you get the double axe
You're trapped with Can-I-Bus, just relax
I came to collect tax, it's as simple as that
I raid your refrigerator, but other than that
Before I leave, I remind you to remember your wack
My girl loves Usher, but she said he getting cocky
I told her, ""Shut up,"" 'cause that's the same way she knocked me
In the name of Hip Hop, I rock beats, on block streets
There ain't an emcee that can stop me
Need more beats, Scott Storch ain't cheap
In Virginia, DMP and Knotz got heat
I get around like Pac and Shock-G
In a drop Jeep, licking off shots Sacchi
It don't have to be a special occasion, I be blazing
I'm Jamaican, you know that I don't worship no pagan
This is real Canibus, leave your nose aching
Niggas be hating, but on the low, they know the flow's dangerous
The Hip Hop Joe Namath, never missed a payment
Don't say shit to me, you talk to the niggas I came with
Kay Slay shit nigga, Drama King nigga

3RD QTR 2015 Canibus Features Update,UnKnown,2015,"We some turtle tree smoking Cyclops raiders roaming with Logan
Drink from the ocean, howl at the Moon
After cesium exposure, launch homing missiles off of the shoulder
Spider drones blow the front doors open
Kick your picket fence over, shoot up the engine block motor
Explosion, fire extinguish the chauffeur
They say black lives matter for sunrise sacrifice on the Sabbath
Is this a floating city or a sinking palace?


I focus on one thing, the sound of insects crunching
Refugees barefoot hunting
Wars and rumours of wars, dullahs wearing scrubs doing chores
Delivering new bars on the floors
Small cities under the surface, shadow government purpose
Over medicated population make 'em nervous
Relocate, recover, retaliate
Bloodthirst for the solar sunburst, I salivate
Purple lips call me amethyst face

Got a crew big enough to clock ya stop ya proper
Bout to bring the pain

And they'll be sick of my name
Til they need to see a doctor
Fat rhymes flat lines

Pneumonic
I recover rare earth metal drunk electronics
No matter how you slice it
We meet our fate
The ruling class says let them eat shit layer cake
Nano lithium powered
I sit atop trillium tower
Counting every single invisible hour
Automaton automated foo fighter formations
Standin' ovation
Poet Laureate of the Nation

Show ’Em How,Hip-Hop for $ale,2005,"Yeah {??*echoes*}??

They don't know what they fuckin with
They don't know how you bust it 'Bis
They don't know how you comin man
They don't know how you done this shit
Yo show 'em how a brother spit

The MC, with the N-O-T-T-Z, yeah!

Aiyyo Canibus'll spark it for ya, Nottz'll paint the target for ya
Mic Club'll launch it toward ya
This is the beginning of the rest of my life
Rippin the mic, and rippin it right, you listen you like
You dislike you get disciplined with the pipe
Muzzle flashes of light that says goodbye to life
I'm anti-social but humble
I blow a hole in you to get a hello from you! If that's what it come to
A little camera shy, I play the background
Turn the mic on, lock the cage, I attack crowds
Y'all niggas is just clones that rhyme
From a bloodline that's closer to yours than mine
You ignore the signs, but we all divine
DJ's rewind, MC's distort the time
Sharp enough to read your mind, I can hear your applause in silence
You're fuckin with an awesome talent, yo
 - repeat 2X

Yo, you gotta call this a comeback, I been here for years
You should thank God for answerin your prayers
The hip-hop hero, off of hip-hop skid row
I rip a show for a beer and a smoke
You know that hip-hop flow that got him clearin both coasts
For that hip-hop show I appear as the host
Used to be the type of MC they was scared to approach
Nowadays I just share what I know, spare what I don't
Might act like I care but I don't, see they want me to share
It's only logical they fear what I wrote
Forty-fives with broken handles go off like roman candles
Ricochetin through your mans and you
They so busy tryin to get an ambulance for you
They ain't notice that a fan was hit too, plannin to sue
They got a lot of anger for you
Introduce you to the Anger Management crew, with Canibus too
Switch places with the person that was bandagin you
And start stranglin you, and keep stranglin you, yo


Yo, they don't know how to double 'Bis
They already woulda done the shit, Canibus the original thumbprint
Five MC's, pick one quick
He's usually on the thumb you lift
Yo, y'all fuckin with an awesome talent
I can't be silent, where's the balance?
I'm on some Kanye shit, waitin for my ""Spaceship""
Exercisin patience, grindin for this paper
The universal language is love, not hatred
Sex money and drugs, destroy your foundation
That's what I would say, if I had to make a statement
But sex money and drugs, built this proud nation!
Salvation without authentication, false pagans
Bought lawmakers to orchestrate how the law changes
We the new breed of firebreathers, inspire speeches
Got fans fightin in bleachers, they can't keep quiet neither
I wanna team up with the best there is
Bless the mic and address what is, impress the kids
The deep life I live is shallow to sheep
'Til I show a couple scars, let the experience speak, yo

Crisis Music,UnKnown,2013,"It's very complicated around here
Strangers who come out here have problems
(What sort of problems?)
What? (What sort of problems?)
If they catch them, they kill them
They don't ask any questions
They just kill people
(Why do they do that?)
What? They're paranoid
Because they think they've come to spy on them
They're paranoid

Your stomach hurt the whole night cause you ate too much GMO rice
To go along with your GMO life
You just a dummy with a smart phone
And you belong in the poor social class in the country you call home
The old grizzly bear with some nappy ass hair
Selfish motherfucker, no honey to spare, yeah
Energy shortage, the poor got to pay for it
The water is poisonous, wait a couple days for it
Third world conditions, no way out
Relief's on the way, they say it could be any day now
I say they lying tryna stall you, alter your view
The S&M Executioner escort you down the hall
To a noose in a FEMA camp freighter caboose
I trade a pocket knife for a pair of boots
Born as a beggar, die with more spiritual treasure
The Nebuchadnezzar letters from dead repossessors
Belly up to the bar, half a bottle of Maker's Mark
Shut the fuck up, it ain't safe to talk
By the hook or crook, certainly not ever by the book
That's the reason the world's so corrupt
The bank is like pussy, they tell you it's yours
Soon as you turn your back, they open up they drawers
Flugelrads with computer jobs
Adam Zakar plays basketball, he just wants cash and cars
He lit a match, he wanted to check what's in his tank
That's why we all call him ""skinless Frank""
A loss of confidence of leadership
They don't report till they see the shit hit the fan then they plead the fifth

Property, gold, Ice Age, cold
Es solamente piel y huesos
Property, gas gold, Ice Age, cold
Es solamente piel y huesos

Cursed, blessed, all in the same breath
It's a miracle Germaine got anything left
They tell you to relax, then stab you in the back
While the world collapse through small covert attacks
They observe the boss, a brown nosers' work of art
He tells everybody else to leave the room, then removes your heart
He says ""don't ever turn your back on God""
The vampire of emotions and thoughts
A few adults hug close in the dark
Somebody opens the door, to find out what emotions are for
The future is gone, feast your eyes upon the new world at dawn
That's what you get for observing the boss
Cursed, blessed, all in the same breath
We had all the time in the world, didn't prep
Mercury extracts the gold from the ore
The same thing happens when I write metaphors
Cinderella and the brown dwarf out taking a walk
Then both bodyguards morph into a horse
The horse morphs into Leviathan El General
Leviathan brimstone and fire emulsifying him
5, 6, 7, 8 limbs count them again
I was just standing there in some timbs
They had rockets, ratchets and bang sting tactics
I don't know they names but people call them Fascists
Couldn't fight that with practice
It's like you had to go back in time before all of this happened
Before sister rebuke the slaves ancient ways
What rhymes with Dana Dane? Saint Germaine
Salt and pepper flakes of gray, I was ill back in the day
Keep pace with the track, tracking the pace
Report aliens from outer space, laugh in your face
You got nothing to say? You had your chance to escape
Handcuffed to an anvil, so when was your chance to escape?
Dance with the wolves, handshake with the apes
Take a apple from a snake, watch the Fascist put powder on his face
Cause he don't understand how to relate
He didn't even have to use two of his hands
Cause nobody lives longer than a nuclear plant
We on food stamps, but get rude about school grants
We get mad cause we don't got enough YouTube fans
Ebonic super cram, ruin the plan, two suits take a cruise in a van
Super advanced, got something called Zeus in his hands
Flugelrads with computer jobs, computer program
Introduce you to Hip Hop shogun showman
Resistance is futile' the battle rifle shoots two miles
You got the juice, the Jones look for you now
The son of King Neptune, a million dolphins come to my rescue
But I didn't want to impress you
Cursed, blessed, all in the same breath
Autobot Rock gonna explain the rest",https://genius.com/Canibus-crisis-music-lyrics

The beat like there's nothing too easy
I said fuck it, I'mma show these niggas somethin'
Rip the Reptilian
Hot but cold blooded
Rip your fuckin' face off
I feel like you runnin'

I spit verses the hardest
God ain't make me no promise
Mad up in your eyes
God made me the monster

So run Attila run
But just remember I can smell you when you bleed
Big black bat wings speed
I run you down in the street
No hard feelings, I just wanted a bite to eat
Eat the skin off a human being
People meat is very sweet
The Spittsburgh Beast worked an hour a week
I am nine foot eleven, I was born 2007
Let go, I board the giant starship called Little Heaven
Kite weight, my skeletal structure different from ya'll
Now babble for the angelic  once more
EEE 
Optimus Prime when you die
Live complex, do this to make the hyper Rubik's cube twist
Watch him chop it the remix, who gave proof of this infinity shit?
Complex complex complex complex
You know the name, now show some damn respect


I ain't runnin' I'm just hard to impress
My T Rex tail wrapped around your necks
Doin' weight room sex
Rip the Reptilian Viking
Part time cyber part time violent
One million raps read across the 
Countin' my love you'd probably be the only survivor
Experience makes you tired before it makes you you wiser
The irony of me rhymin' the rhythms timeless
A slip dividing the iris on the mic talkin like this
I went from a regular laser guided lyrical hybrid
To a lyrical cynical reptilian with gingivitis
Hold your tongue out over the lighter
That's for being a biter
Gunpowder's for being a dick rider
Listen I know you don't listen to much hip hop. ""But now I...""
Shut the fuck up! You still a dick rider!
Captain Cold Crush just got colder
Gold plated kubotas
Chrome plated collapse  the onyx black soldiers
Burlap hands show the host you match your finger grip toasters
Still kill you with my bare hands
What a joker
He walks in they talkin'
He walks out they report back to the source that ordered them to stalk him
What is it they want from him?  He doesn't have it
They ransacked his cave lookin for the  Cro-Magnon
Majestic mix master, architect of disaster
Rip the Jacker, the viceroy of reptile boy language
I spit a mix at 'em like Spanglish
Straight poison to the pancreas
Apollo 11 complex B12 moon based massacre

Generation X mechanical mandible write backwards
Reduced life span average, compulsive mic habits
Obsessed but completely obsessing over the right language
Pretty elf bitch, nice titties, how's it hangin'?
Tell me which one of these starships I'm commandin'
Goddamn it go to auxiliary power
They go to warp speed, I want to feel the guilt of my power
That's an order nigga you better listen
I want you on every weapon device system we've ever been given
I don't know if this LBCB2 is  gonna work on the moon
We upgrade to JCR in June
Snow White and her little friends are gonna cry me a river
When they find out Mr. Brown Dwarf  is comin' to dinner
Reptile my tail wrapped around your neck now
You didn't respect it before
You better respect it now

You couldn't see me with Jacob piece from Jesus
I lean you back like your spine just cracked
Rhyme chiropractor get paid to adjust raps
Spit somethin, let me see if I'mma bust back
I front back gore yo' ass 'til you collapse
Spin hats around lightspeed well hubcaps
My gun'll clap faster than Savion Glover taps
Wave the four at you, if it take more than that
I kick down your door before you get the double axe
Strapped for Canibus, just relax
I came to collect taxes, as simple as that
I raid your refrigerator, but other than that
Before I leave I remind you to remember you're whack
Yo my girl loves Usher but she said he gettin cocky
I told her SHUT UP, cause that's the same way she knock me
In the name of hip-hop I rock beats on blocked streets
There ain't an MC that can stop me
Need more beats? Scott Storch ain't cheap
In Virginia, DMP or Nottz got heat
Yo, _I Get Around_ like 'Pac and Shock G
In a drop Jeep, lickin off shots at {?}
It don't have to be a special occasion, I'll be blazin

Its because im trying to find a perfect place for me to shit on
Niggas hear about me and discreetly set up a date to me
To see if they can defeat me
So I ain't ready to let no motherfucker eat me
That's why you find little pieces of MCs in my feces weekly
You can't beat me you can't control+alt+delete me
Nigga you can't even shine on a song that features me
Slippery saliva keeps my delivery tighter
Enabling me to outmaneuver Russian MIG Fighters
Launching missiles on whack rap artists like they was targets
For coming to broader markets with that garbage
From downtown Newark to South Orange, niggas is paying homage
I'll battle you for anything you own worth pawning
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with my tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
From the 'How Can I Be Down?' conference to the Gavin
Whack emcees get slapped in their faces for rapping
For absolutely no Rhyme or Reason I start beefing
Spitting words faster than two Puerto Ricans speaking
Keys for me to make examples out of someone you respect
And that will discourage you from trying to test
Whoever ain't nice enough to rhyme wit me
Should surrender their soul and combine with me
Or die violently, I try to be a millionaire before the year's up
I'm hungry like a dog with his ears up
This little nigga with heart from north Newark
The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of the great white shark, I'll rip you apart
My state of the art lyrically laser is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of the cranial cavity
Is what actually what happens for any motherfucker for trying to battle me
90 minutes of heat, 90 minutes of lyrics and beats, 90 minutes and these brick city streets

You must have smoked somethin I used to call pool hall crack
Put a suit on you still look whack
Somewhere givin orders from confined quarters, handcuffed to a fag
Played the street too much, shoulda been in the lab
Now you sad, mad at who you was fussin with last
Life's a bitch ain't it? Smile, it ain't nothin to laugh
Rose hell at show'n'tell, brought a gun to your class
Keep the herb on the dash cause I'm servin 'em fast
Classic lyrics for that ass, cause the purpose is cash
Look I got a couple photos of you tryin to showboat
Before my gunboat touch your throat, don't talk
The microphone shark tear your bones apart
Spread you over your background like bogus art
Put the most in art, try to focus on the frozen dart
Cold and dark as a cobra's heart
I drink the absinthe raw, no chaser
Madness follows me like investigators after Al'Qaeda
The metaphor make a voice like Lord Vader
If you love hip-hop, I am your saviour
Rip your mixtape up and still take a paycut
Me and you in the booth, who you think is gon' say somethin?
'Member ninety-eight when I rung those bells?

When I'm done I make a thief of you
And I always share a piece of you

Prepare for the blitzkrieg blur of the Fuhrer
Put my CD in your Walkman and watch it slowly stir

If you wanna witness the world's illest rapper at work
Perhaps some of my earlier work, 'Music Makes Me High'
Uni-4-Orm and a couple of Clue tapes going berserk
One of the greatest rappers in the Universe
Literally crush you lyrically, fuck what you think of me


Call the city of Nottingham, tell them I'm dropping in
Prepare the pussy and weed, for me as your offerings
I have a Rip the Jacker conference
Get the Queen to sponsor it and invite members of parliament
Ring the states, talk to Bill Gates
'Cause I'm obsessed with the Microsoft X-Box that microprocessed
I'll ask him if he's heard a hundred bars yet
Be psychotically complex climb on top secret documents
Show him that I'm not impressed and I'm not a threat
Tell him the album drops of October 25th
Fifteen pounds or fifteen hundred pence

Shows I'm booking them now, push me around get chucked in the mouth
I'll permanently fuck up your smile

Fans bum rush me, am I stunning or what?
Canibus and Joe Buhdha bunning it up
Sixteen's is not enough, you need a hundred and up
Follow the Leader 'til you find Jesus

One in a million I flow brilliant
Bent spoons with my mind before but I never filmed it
You fronting if you never heard me spit ill shit
You lying if you said I never killed it
You build with wigs and stick, I build with bricks
Opened the seventh seal after I revealed the sixth
Steel the fifth, get on some Four Horsemen shit

This is the 'Escape To Victory'
The Ripper is more talented than Mr. Ripley and more risky than circus gypsies
Born in the 50's and was ripping by the 60's
And still remember the first time that I removed the man's kidneys
With these, like a Nightmare on Elm Street dream
Mini machetes sharper than Wolverine's
Injections to the neck or suppress the screams
Leave clues behind for the forensics team that inspects the scene
Serial killing machines to the extreme
An all eye seeing in-theory- that being, surgically supreme MD, slash MC
Slash you across the cheek, and leave a gash that bleeds profusely

In a pro campus who would dispace

I gotta give you credit
You look like a garbage pail kid descendent
I used to collect them and I see the resemblance
I'll give you ten cents for every time you spit ten bars
Do it five times, you got enough to buy a candy bar
Let me hear some more, you ripped it God
Here's a penny, now get the fuck out of my face, you fraud
Niggas better raise the standards, or get the fuck off campus
‘Cause you can't even talk to Canibus
Moved all over the place, I used to rhyme over Miami Bass
But kept moving state to state
I'm a rogue, I'm a warrior on the road
Like them CIA moles, living in shadows
A highly hazardous negro, with a patented flow
Crazier than a Hollywood actor would act on coke
I ain't no joke, ask Rakim
I wouldn't share the spotlight with anybody but him
And the Four Horsemen, the Yang and Yin
We open the can of big bang theory all over again
As deadly as a cobra fang puncturing your blood vein
Or Mad Max behind the wheel of a Mustang
Puffing a hundred and twenty nine octane
Enough thrust to achieve flight like prop-planes
Armed to the teeth like tanks in Iran
Driving like Terminator two through block lanes
You wanna be a thug, you better watch it man
Getting shot can't help u feel 2Pac's pain
After the autopsy they'll just pull out your brain
Put it in a jar you probably won't feel a thing
They go straight to the pawn shop and pawn your bling
This rap industry is such a morbid thing
Country singers live different, their fans got more commitment
They get bigger shipments, big difference
It's a big fitness, and we can learn something
Why would you want to rap forever and earn nothing
I rap like the end of the earth is coming
Grab the mic and act like I wanna murder something
Cursing, fighting or busting like a drunken Russian
Show me a wack emcee and I promise I'll bust him",https://genius.com/Canibus-october-23rd-lyrics
Your Saviour Freestyle,The Vitruvian Man (Mixtape),2005,"(Canibus)
Yeah, MicClub
Yo
We got off to a cold start, let me warm shit up
You're now listening to Can-I-Bus
Why would you do that? Your view too black
You must have smoked something I used to call Pool Hall crack
Put a suit on you, you still look wack
Somewhere giving orders from confined quarters, handcuffed to a fag
Played the street too much, should have been in a lab
Now you sad, mad at who you was fussing with last
Life's a bitch, ain't it? Smile, it ain't nothing to laugh
Rose hell at show and tell, brought a gun to your class
Keep the herb on the dash, ‘cause I'm serving them fast
Classic lyrics for that ass, ‘cause the purpose is cash
Look I got a couple of photos, of you trying to showboat
Before my gun bolt touch your throat, don't talk
The microphone shark, tear your bones apart
Spread you over your background like bogus art
Put the Mots in Art, try to focus on the frozen dart
Cold and dark, as a cobra's heart
I drink the absinthe raw, no chaser
Madness follows me like investigators after Al-Qaeda
The metaphor maker, voice like Lord Vader
If you love Hip-Hop, I am your savior
Rip your mix tape up, and still take a pay cut
Me and you in the booth, who you think is going to say something?
Remember in ninety-eight when I rung those bells?
I'm a chip off the old block, like Uncle L
Fuck a bootlace, I'll strap Velcro up
Niggas had gun talk, so what? They still didn't show up
Fuck around with Bus on the mic, they got no luck
Other than that, I don't really know what",https://genius.com/Canibus-your-saviour-freestyle-lyrics

Dog, the snake eats the canary
They issue the order not to come near me
No matter how bad I sound when they hear me
Reasonable doubt settin' in
But no matter what you wanna ask
You can't question that the rhymes are infinite
The taser to the the throat discharge a million volts
The bolts in your skull smoke from the Frankenstein flow
I got love for my alien friends
Niobium-titanium, 'Ranium, Copper Oxide
Say it again
After I kill death only life'll be left
When the song disconnect your right through your left
Never stereotype but it'll be a sound burial tonight
If I catch you on the karaoke mic
Clippin' my whiskers, handling my goatee business
Call upon your witness - Canibus spit encrypted
Step to the stage like I'm practicing kicks in the cage
You can't bring clips to this game
Enter the key code, the light goes from green to gold
The beat upload
Get ready for the dino fold flow
From outta the wormhole
Where I barely heard the words that were spoke:
RTJ double O
I sit on a throne of Mastadon bones
Slaves below moan tryna master the poems
If Hip-Hop is dead
Then what the fuck are you supposed to do if you a full-fledged Hip-Hop head?

Rip the Jacker
Got you chemically dependent
Trying to kick is harder than having a body with all six senses
My sick sentences cut you down with a quickness
Gaze into my crystal ball bitch bear witness
I've got a sick sense of humor
Motivated to give you a brain tumor through the motherfuckin' computer
Automatic sentry gun
The old nerd is not even home
Stand guard over the masters
Don't move or I will blast you to a...

Eat your skull like a Concord grape that tastes great
Transform before you can even finish saying wait

You wanna talk about Second Round Knockout?!
Watch out!
You can't fuck with 10,000 bars, you a cop out
Nobody got what I got now
Whether you like it or not, Rip the Jacker own Hip-Hop now
Canibus can stop now
I took him off the clock now
You can't battle the nigga robot style
Cyclops growl, his teeth look like a rock pile
I seen him bite a fuckin' long barrel of a .50 cal
The eagle face watches from above the clouds
The Lizard Beast Face watches anything that touch ground
You don't understand? Let me bust it down
You can spit a billion bars tomorrow, but it means nothing now
Get out, get on your job, and run it down for your honor
Do it out of respect for your Author Poor Pauper
Gun battle with supernatural giants from Gulliver's Travels
You ain't ridin'?! Get the fuck out the saddle!

Pine Cone Poems Pt. 2,The ‘C’ of Tranquility,2010,"The C of tranquility
Canibus Spit for infinity
I revolve with the earth lyrically
I rest alone in a cold cabin composed of stone from old Agin
A sarcophagus filled with gold tablets
The archaeological dig-site, excavated the bone matter of this unknown rapper
The blood of the Gorgon was used as a cure for the poison
The poison that destroyed his organs
His DNA was shaped like a Series of sideways 8's
Space time is converted to time space
The soundwave signals looks like ocean tides when they ripple
He spit to precision instrumentals
Sidewinder rhymes hit you, split you
The target area surface was no wider than a nickel
Control Room simple.. His chair was chiseled from quartz crystal
It gets so hot, his skin sizzle
He piloted the missile from a digital menu inside remote headgear he would put on to look into
By mastery of the mental
He was able to see what the past and future civilizations had been through
Acoustic imagery transmitted through the music n energy
When I'm spittin no distance can limit me
The gallery of my art was refabricated and placed in a Ark
But grave robbers rip the pages apart, they got caught
Whoever told me the secret is now dead
I cannot tell you or I will end up like them!!
The meaning of these rhymes are dead to the modern day mind
Even if you hear this a thousand times
Because if this many have died
Ya inner light will not shine if ya Pineal gland is calcified
The silver cord is a metaphor for the will of the lord
I was called to climb aboard and explore
That's when I saw the tree of life in the yard
The apples on the floor were gored to the core!!
The coil spirals remind you, but be mindful
External experience reflects what's inside you
Inside us all, behind the wall, inside ya skull, but exposed in a song
AHHHHHH, I was struck in an electrical storm
The flesh on my left arm is scarred the mic's gone!!!!!",https://genius.com/Canibus-pine-cone-poems-pt-2-lyrics

It's like this y'all, Canibus y'all
About to rip y'all with the raw shit y'all
With my hard core raw dog Kurupt
'Bout to blow this shit the fuck up
It's two-thousand B.C., 'bout to take it to
Two-thousand A.D
Yea, my mother fucking man Ray on the track
Check it out
(Canibus)
Yo, yo
It's two-thousand A.D.: After Disaster
Fly's buzz around a million rappers cadavers
Never been the type to talk
My ice-grill's like, looking down the wide jaws of a white shark
'Bout to rip off your arms like perforated paper
A hundred times more sharper than stainless steal razors
Shock you with an electrically charged taser
'Till you turn blue in the face, and die from asphyxiation
The stench of a thousand ounces
Grab you by the throat and blow my second-hand weed smoke down it
Don't give a fuck what month you dropping in
I'll be in the Dungeon hollering, 'fuck you and your cult following'
You cum-swallowing transsexual fag
With crabs, and breasts that sag, dressed in drag
Running full-paged ads in the porno mags
With pictures of you with a dick in your mouth and a dick in your ass
Kurupt where you at?
Yea, the Dungeon style
Yea, the dungeon
Yo
Lyrically, I'm bananas
My tongue moves like Hindu belly-dancers performing tantra
I blur your vision like slow shutter speeds on the camera
Get up in that ass like colon cancer
Brain cells handpicked
Organically enhanced with third millennium medical standards
My D.N.A. was tampered with
By genetic engineers with scholarship grants that studied at Stanford
Canibus, too advanced for this shit
Turn spit to gas vapour, then back to spit
Your style is one-quarter bull, one-quarter horseshit
One-quarter garbage, and one-quarter nonsense
Make you nauseous 'till you vomit
Like the Backwards Pharcyde video going forwards
As I drink the blood of a thousand emcees
I can tell by the taste of the pulp if they was hand-squeezed
This is Transylvania, vampire mania
You should be afraid of my fangs in your neck draining you
I was made to bust, made to crush
Any mic me and Kurupt touch, turn to dust
See? I'm as dangerous as they come
Dangerous with or without a gun, I've been dangerous from day one
Rhyme flows explode like pyros
Stick to your ribs like chicken and thick gravy from Roscoes
Get your head flown if you dumb in the dome
Or struck with some stones 'till you feel numb in the bones
You better keep your big mouth closed
'Fore I stick the muzzle of the chrome in that hole under your nose
Send a signal to my index, and tell it to fold
In the direction of my wrist bone to release your soul
I told you to freeze, if I was you I would have froze
But you chose the other route and got blown full of holes
Pistol to your mug, cripple your tongue, rip through your lungs
Write your name on your tombstone scribbled in blood
Give me a little love
There anybody out there that never felt one rhyme that Can-I-Bus bust?
You a liar, liar, pants on fire
Watch the G.O.A.T. with the ghost-writer get slaughtered by a tiger
Seen him in the Pun video holding up his lighter
Smeared his career like doo-doo inside a diaper
My style is sicker than, infected women and men
I'm so raw, I can catch AIDS without sticking it in
Flip and dip like shrimps and scampi
Switch language like a black kid raised by a Spanish nanny
And we do it like that when we in the dungeon
Past the motherfucking mic to Kuruption",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-dungeon-lyrics

Bar war rappin the temple of tranquility
10 thousand bars, nobody do it better
There ain't a truer ripper
Rip the jacker forever

Rip the Robot; RTR
Also known as a perpetual poetry drone
2013; the RTR bill is enacted
The first special access project to track down rappers
Deploy, Seek out, locate and destroy
Rip the Robot, the most advanced MC android
Go ahead, laugh at him, bet you can't outrap him
Created 250 thousand years after Adam
Real MC status, three key factors
Include three times a day rapping to a beat that matches
He made advances to the english language
Far above the present day standard
At a time when no one had any answers
Hes a joint task force robot, so what?
Nobody raps like rip the robot does
RTR digital vulture, mars rover vocal controller
He consolidates this complex culture
Bull rider, leer jet provider on the tar-mac
Exchanging trade secrets with a secret admirer
I mean, why would any human being assume
Theyre more intelligent, less irrelevant, or equally eloquent?
Pull yourself together, rip
We agreed we wouldn't get into that rhetoric
Heres some digital medicine
Turn that music down, or turn it off
But this is how so many foreigners learned to talk
Man created government
Government created laws
Laws create corruption
Corruption create wars
Nobel laureate poets attempted to describe what they saw
The precursor RTR was born
Then shortly after updated
With automated reading, writing, and speech syncopation
Software interpretation
Recognition to interfaces with natural native language dictation
From RTJ's layered platform databases
Wow, simply the greatest cloud computing from the great chamber
Rip the robot omega
Rtr simply the greatest cloud computing from the great chamber
Rip the robot omega
Finally, vocal cords no longer vibrate
RTR will provide an infinite soundscape
The program broke down, and none of us know how we escape
And now nobodies rap style is safe
Initiate RTR protocol: 12212012
Acquiesce any potential targets
Cross-reference all semantic effects and causes
Arm your bar war bombers
Locate and harvest
Any uncompliant or defiant rap artists",https://genius.com/Canibus-metal-gear-metaphors-lyrics
Tyrique,The Vitruvian Man (Mixtape),2005,"(Intro: Canibus, speaking during chorus)
Yeah
Tyrique ain't here to tell his story
So I'mma tell it for him…
(Chorus, Queen sample)(2x)
Hey little babe your changing
Babe are you feeling sore
Ain't no use in pretending
Don't wanna play no more
(Verse One)
Yo, Tyrique got an older brother running the streets
300 large a week he moving so Tyrique hardly speak to him
Tyrique got a younger brother Jamal
Who got a full scholarship at St. John's to ball
His mom named Myrtive, I think that's how it sound when I heard it
She was on her way to church late for worship
She praying that he quit hustling
She say one day Ezekiel 23 verse 2 gonna mean somthing
He said, ""Aight ma"" but it don't mean nothing
She know his older brother got him into weed smuggling
She out of touch with him, wonder why he touch illegal substances
Can't believe he messing with that stuff again
I guess it just depends, he putting up the rent
Been doing it ever since, she ain't complain back then
Way back when, he following his heart not the Lord
'Cause Tyrique changed and he ain't pretending no more
(Chorus)(2x)
Yo, Tyrique ain't playing, he feeling good, he feeling great
He got three safes with nothing but scrilla and mixtapes
He push weight from state to state
Spit great, eat food on big plates, tip Benjamin big face
His shipment's never late to make the deadline dates
No fed time, the bottom line is no mistakes
Tyrique phone stay ringing
He got twenty unconfirmed but known women that he all hitting
Major release 'bout to drop, he number one on the charts
Street teams on every block, so many features and spots
People say he 'bout to supersede Pac
Now I know Tyrique hot, but if you ask me, we always gonna need Pac
He just anxious for his record to drop
The music industry watched as it shot to the top
He got the hottest video on The Box
Major change, moms and pop show Tyrique love non-stop
Chorus:x2
Two o' clock in the morning the horn ring
Usually he never answer it, but it was his brother calling
He picked up the phone and started talkinh
But it wasn't Jamal, it was Detective Hall trying to stalk him
He said, ""I'm on the corner, Fifth and Carson
Sitting on the car garnet, your brother's in the back unconscious""
Tyrique said, ""Who, Jamal?"" Detective said, ""Nah try again
I'm talking bout your older brother Iverson
If you ain't here in ten minutes I'ma ride him in
And if you get here, I'm still taking both you guys in""
Tyrique ain't know how to react
Detective Hall said, ""I got you now my friend"" and hung up the jack
Tyrique stuffed twenty g's in a sack, tucked the gat
Drove to Third and Carson, parked and called him back
Detective Hall said, ""Where you at?
Yo time is paper, you waste mine I'ma make you give it back""
Tyrique saying to himself, ""Man, fuck the bullshit
You got a dirty badge bitch, I'ma give you a full clip""
But out loud he saying, ""Alright man, what you wanna do
I'm less than two blocks from you""
Tyrique start to feel it was a set-up
Detective Hall just wouldn't let up, he pressing his luck
Approaching the car with his hand on his firearm
Tyrique calm but he wish he had a fucking firebomb
Just like something he wrote in a song before
Sweat in his palm, the feelings in his legs was gone
His chest was numb, his shirt was red, where he bled
They found Tyrique and Jamal both dead
One through the heart, second week on the chart, the album peaked
Now he platinum in the streets, Tyrique rest in peace
Tyrique or Jamal could be me
And Tyrique or Jamal could be any up-and-coming emcee
(Chorus)(2x)
(Outro: Canibus, during chorus)
Freaky Tah, Jam Master J, Soldier Slim, B.I.G.,
Big L, 2Pac, y'all rest in peace...

Shot group not tight, I readjusted the sight
On the Dillinger, spin cylinders and bust the pipe
Garrison personnel up in the Hamburger Hill Hotel
I roll an L and call Dylan's cell (Ayo Wha'gwan, who dis?)
I'm in the backyard shooting beer bottles off bricks
Now the shot group tight, I readjusted the sight

Of three dudes, shout to number one fire team too


Born Sun, I'm strapped with a homicide rap
My clap murder the track, do my bid and come back
Shark tooth thumb tacks, bullet proof tires with run flat
With a bellowed shell and gun claps
Run through Hell with hunchbacks
In an 18 wheeler, pictures of Jesus Christ on the mud flaps
Two-twos with tattoos, supernatural black jewels
Gezundheit, gats get at you
In ripped jeans and chains I'm a slave to the rhythm
Obama is the prez but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
That's my word, rappers slip on my slick words
I eat bars, shoot metaphors and spit verbs

While you’re at it, why don't you take your wig off dear?

She's the professor Xavier type
She doesn't strike you as the type that likes the lyrics I write
We spend cold icicle nights, communicate Skype
After work go home, lay pipe, then play fight
Explain life, talk about what our day was like
I got a blow torch for bubbles and candlestick market trouble
Whatever man, I was born to hustle
Read the charts, enjoy the warm breeze and fart
Been there, done that, I don't need to talk
Cause I'm a swasta sipping vodka, eating tandoori steak 'n lobster

Backtrack create better raps or face the executioners axe
Who  execute you 'cause your music is wack

But that's Slick Rick's rap, so I'ma pay homage like that
Get busy over beats that break the boom bap

The reverb of the sound will hunt you down
The lyrics get you so high you can't come down
He didn't get far his ash tray is still warm
The bar's he was writing cut off in mid thought
He said his world was so small he talked to the walls when he's bored, when they start to talk back he was gone
Beyond where he began to be the rhyme
And the rhymes began to cross through the arteries of time
This is nonsense, no this is lyrical content
The zombies spit a billion bars after the sound check
Don't show me nothing I don't wanna see
Don't ask me to spit something if I don't wanna speak
He tried to take so he took it to his wake
No matter who you try to blame it's too late
How it feel to be on the other side of this rhyme
Where everything or anything is mine
For a moment I was the illest MC
Now that moment is of no interest to me
I only care about Infinity...
Lyrically I care about Infinity and my dreams
Seeing it for real show me what Infinity means
I had to force myself, then I endorsed myself
To get away from the source of the discourse I felt
I mean, how long you gonna run around saying a nigga can't spit
How many Canibus clones up in this bitch?
How many mixes was made from that Poet Laureate Infinity shit
I wouldn't be surprised if he quit putting albums out but his              clones continue to spit, microphones continue to get Ripped

Run over your skull with a tank, rip out your guts with a shank
Then bite you with poisonous fangs

Nigga you can’t, and you shouldn't even try to
Half of the square root of my IQ is beyond you
So when you see me in the street, you better not say a motherfucking thing to me, cause, nigga, you pink pussy
I got some live niggas with me, with some trigger happy fingers of fury, put one in your skully and five in your belly
Cause whenever rhymes fly like bullets in drive-bys
I catch them and throw them back like Miami Jai-Alai
I cock mines, spin counter-clockwise and shoot five
Three miss you and two hit you, one in the leg, one in the thigh
Now you're on the floor immobilized
Screaming that you never wanted to die ’till I put one in your eye  Cause Doo Wop was old school before niggas talked about jewels Before engineers was using Pro Tools
Make my own rules no matter what I flow to
Start a vacuum in the mic-booth
The way my motherfucking tongue moves

Chance assigns each ripper their own personal housing
Walking down Downing Street just browsing

Tell them impatient niggas to stop fussin'
And banging they knife and fork on the table

What's the point in eatin' a meal that ain't ready?
Just to go outside and get punched in the belly
""You threatening me?"" No
""Then why you questioning me, yo?
If it was me I would have finished it by now."" So?

Stop acting all childish every media outlet
Do you think it's a smart move
To waltz into the restaurant and be rude
What do you think they gonna do to your food?
There's five hours of free Infinity on Youtube
More than that when the rippers' mix in a good mood
100% truth, that's my statement
So anybody complainin'
Can't do a damn thing about how long it's takin'
Cause I'm the one that makes it
And you ain't gonna rush me just because you impatient
Who else got somethin' to say Bis?
""This is Infinity Detox, you got something to say Rip?""
""I think we forgot to say a couple of things boss
But that list was so long I'm not passively playin' dawg
I got your back, fuck it, I'm gonna do it myself""

You gotta hold it down
For every ripper who supported and helped
Infinite Phase showed me what DC told me
The rippers' abilities nullify numbers
We got our own army of creativity
And artistry the way it ought to be
People drop a PLOO tape every week
Slayers don't fuck with CC
But fuck with real rippers with real identities
Like Passionate and Maltese, RIP-K123

MC's blowin' ganja
With Andre the Beast, Presto, Trolla, East Tony
You know my niggas in the streets
(I'm in the bunk)
Listenin' to my lesson sing
Do the damn thing, it's a process
DJ,  King
Flux who came through
 Captain 
In the chopper flyin' over the tropics
 DJ Johan Solo
Mix it in the cockpit create mixin' my new shit
White bong with meta shape drawn
Designs the first PLOO spaceship, it's true
A colorful cube with rainbow exhaust
 pass along the fuel of the Gods
Copernicus monitored this
From the earth to the stars  ridin' shot
By Chandel spittin' bars, we picked up lace
Boom, the seven over
Civilians reported strange lights in the sky
For 12 counties before it got too cloudy
Soul  drops the flare
I found him at Ivy chillin at the boundary
An APB comes out the speakers playin' loudly
Proximal and troubled, detoured on the double
Poetic spy through the Hubble
They saw him in the flesh, man
Fight 
Lizard Beast Face
 on Mars in the rubble
Watch out, enter coordinates
The BTA, was 10 minutes left
Hypodrive max supplied by Jackson
Now play that raw eight track
While I kick back trying to relax
Watchin' something important like battle rap",https://genius.com/Canibus-detox-infinity-lyrics

Ten steps ahead, twenty steps behind you
Spit a rhyme in your ear just to frighten your boo
Most niggas rather ask me, 'You nicer than who?'
When they really want to ask me, 'Who's nicer than you?
The mic on the bicep is the proof, it ain't a lie it's the truth

I'm a two-thousand and two Canibus type-two
Mic guru with gurus and  too
Modules with blood vessel designed tube and
My mind is moving to rewrite blueprints with new ink

I abuse how you think, just get off my dick

I can kick a freestyle any time you demand it
Brain's high-density and my memory's expanded
Breaking sound barriers like the Lockheed
Even with knock-knees I run across rough terrain at Mach speed
Barefoot, Canibus is crazy enough
Genetically engineering eight-leaved clovers for twice the luck
Canibus is my name, play the freestyle game
Physical brain is in better shape than Jack La Lanne
While you sit and wonder how I just took the life of another
Me and my brother jump in the Jeep and burn rubber
Word to my mother, switch cars, that was clever
She said, ""Son, I love you, but they're going to handcuff you""
Cold War veteran, used to assemble weapons for the Kremlin
Disciplined like Olympic gold medalists
Remember this, never ever ""F"" a chick protection-less
'Cause nowadays what you can catch is very infectious
Lest you got a death wish and you want to mess with
Women who poison the walls of their wombs with asbestos
These streets are treacherous, listen to me when I tell you this
Whatever you're trying to buy somebody is selling it
Somewhere, somehow you get gunned down
When the guns go ""blow,"" just 'cause you were running your mouth
All my people in Toronto say a ""no doubt""
You a punk, stop fronting and put the gat down
Kick a rap now, let me see if you can freestyle

Walkin' through the neighborhood full of dead men
Doing head-spins,

Kickin' tight rhymes, send Method Man to another lifetime
Keep Erica all to myself, because I like dames

What up god? No luck? Aww
You can't sell crack on the block no more
Cause I pulled up, parked, rolled up, sparked
Dogs bark. Oh shit! Narcs!
I Jackie Chan up the wall and sit in the dark
Or go running for a jog while I spit in the park
My jigsaw still hard, the metaphors remain sharp
Give you sharp pains through your brain if you slang-box
Me and you in the sandbox with our hands locked
Get the same shit your man with the broken hand got
I bang Glock, I've been hot
Cock bang Mi Ling from Bangkok for ten baht
My broad with the fat ass can sit up front
Your broad that look like trash can sit in the trunk
I'ma fuck 'til I break off chunks
Break off a big chunk of skunk and take off with a blunt
Hit the studio, sometimes I work all day
Still change my voice-box oil every 3K
Step to the stage, throw a sign to the Deejay
Everybody screaming out, ""Do what the weed say!""

How many cyphers I done banged like this?
No hype-man just a hand-mic kit
I approach the stage, by motorcade
Like in the olden days, with my own deejay
Smarty Jones on the microphone: They know I'ma race
The first heat transfer, probably blow up the place
When I win I start cussin', throw the dough in your face
You could keep it, I could get more, I know what it takes
In the parking lot drinkin' on drank
She view the videos, got me thinkin' that I'm holdin' up the wrong banks
No offense, I pull up to star studded events
In an old bucket with tints, with some of my friends
When I say friends I mean a couple buddies of mine
The Glock-nine and the double-action forty-five
Bend your mental
From the beginning to the end is connected to the beginning like infinity symbols
I keep it simple, don't want to offend you
Cause niggas don't understand what they ain't into
Misunderstanding is still a form of understanding

I roll up the spliff and go deal with the day
Nobody can tell Canibus what to say
I play what the fuck I wanna play
If we in the studio I'm gonna take a turn off the bass
The rhymes come through me the energy runs through me
Green Gran Turino hooky comes smellin like patchouli
I'm old school, the dudes do a loogie
Ya rhymes is booty
Ya attitude is over youtube
Your fingerprints on the fence
Take your glasses off, Clark Kent
You know where this starts, you know where it ends
You know where this goes my friend
I am not your friend?  That's good to know
Now you know who I am
Are you talkin to me or are you talkin to him?
I see you go for them talking about the lyrics you said
The day after liberty bled
Our freedom was dead but
Til then he said ""Do everything that you can""

And if he can't bring it back send Rip
Canibus 'MagnifiCentric' on the offensive
Beats bang you in the head 'til it's bent and dented
Spit a sentence too endless to defend against it
One entrance no exit through the barbwire trenches
Cyclone wire fences fire, fuck a Second Amendment
They might check it like they want my attention
Activate all of your senses creating the template
On some no return address shit, like who the fuck sent this
I did, you don't wanna know where I live
The rhyme is inside your mind behind eyelids
I spit third eye logic, my pupil couldn't fit in your socket
The robot prophet with IR Optics
Dirty bars on the table, break three legs and a ankle
The fourth leg was fractured by a nine degree angle

You live by the illest, you die by the illest
If it's alive and it writes rhymes I can kill it

I grind, I scramble, I put them both together and gramble
Bag up the gram, separate the samples
The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to
My lyrics lynch you, give you something to hang to
Your fans mourn, mumbling your song
While the Son of Sam prepares for war
My hands form ram horns
Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly
Sadly he's not too punchy, but still jabby
Stick and move keep stepping, follow my reflection
Demolition any nigga disrespecting the profession
Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction
Is there ever enough protection? The quintessential question
Unroll your maps I'ma show you where we at
Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps
You heard of that, my sandbag leak worser than that
The cowboy going to church with a curve in his hat
Chorus x4

Holding hands in the prayer booth Coupe '45 on the strong side
Dry cleaned suit, snub nose in the boot
Get born again to go to war again
Calling men, tell them start falling in
Hip Hop must not fall again
Chainsaw to the jaw, that's where I'ma cut you
Waterproof duffle, that's where I'ma stuff you
The rainforest jungle, that's where I'ma dump you
And God don't love you so he ain't gonna judge you

Shove This Jay-Oh-Bee - [Social Revolution - Labor/Unions USH],UnKnown,1999," Yo 6 o'clock every morning you waking up yawning/
To the sound of your alarm clock alarming/
About an hour from now you should be at the place of employment/
Which is annoying/
cause it's so boring/
Your co-workers are talking too loud for you to ignore them/
It affects your occupational performance/
You wonder why your work load is so enormous/
Because your boss just laid off three quarters of the whole office/
People get depressed, they get ulcers from the stress that the corporate environment causes/
Regardless of how you ultimately wanna solve this/
Seems to me like you've got one of four choices:/
You could take a new job offer for more chips/
Stick it out a little longer or forfeit/
But my advice to anybody that wants to quit/
It'll feel much better if you say it like this:/

Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job and shove it
I ain't workin here no more
Take this job, take this job, take this job and shove it
 Yo, if your boss is a s-o-b/
Tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b/
Put your middle finger up slowly/
Put it close enough to his face so he can examine it closely/
Say “I ain't workin here no more/
Who do you think you are?”/
Rip your apron off, throw it on the floor/
Run to the door,/
to the payphone make a toll-free call tell your spouse what happened and where you are/
So they can come and get you in the car later on/
And help you search for a new 9 to 5 job/
If the unemployment line ain't that long/
You can take your time printin out W-9 forms/
Eventually, you'll get on if you try hard enough/
And you'll get money if you keep punchin your time card enough/
Maybe you hate it, maybe you love it/
But if you hate it all you gotta do is get mad and tell the boss to/

 Yo, some occupations are like slave gigs
The boss is favored and get placed in something spacious
While the most hated get placed in some small cubicle spaces
Or get thrown down in the basement, get your stapler confiscated
You constantly waitin for a paycheck
Twelve months passed by and you still ain't get paid yet
Here's a optimistic motto
If you ever late for today you could say you early for tomorrow
Most 9 to 5's are hard
Cause the description in the job ain't no picnic in the park
People get hired
Drink coffee to stay wired
So they don't get tired, sleep late, and get fired

You came in late, you already ate,
Nowww, you wanna take a lunch break!? ? !

Till every person unlearn they steak worship
Created? I observe it
The way I interpret, you got nervous, heard you spittin' A.I. verses
The situation worsens, urban insurgent, Haitians in turbans
Came with Jamaicans 'n gave it to the merchants

Watch them zombie soldiers, go on put a stank on 'em
No thanks partner, run 'em over with some tank armor
The drone Can clank clank on 'em
Drop a little Fat Man on 'em, memorial statue stand on 'em
Electroactive magnets spin armor to fragments
Gearbox attachments fastened to iron cast caskets
Fantastic, let the Great Gatsby at it
The old asthmatic rap addict with the battle rap static
Metaphor mosaics are made in stages
We gave the music industry a Fibonacci facelift
Cowboys and aliens landin' in spaceships
Every single nation fightin' off invasion
We exodus to the inner labyrinth
We follow phosphorescent glowing to a dozen other bases
Whoever ain't got the muscle to make it, stay here
We gon' come back after they shapeshift

I body ten whales like underwater chemtrails
Or windsails manufactured out o' they entrails
Utilize free will on a divine path back to the source
But (shape tie?) try to throw me of course
What materialism
The physical path, the spiritual depth
Break the schism, master the third dimension
I known him all my life, he my people, he my amigo
But my ego is my enemy though
Proof of the sentence, spit out bones, you finished
Tell niggas, open they windows, burn some incense
For instance, act off instinct
Talk to the sphinx, do statistic, my music is mystic
Then Mother Nature know I'm talkin' to her
For those seekin' the cure, I breastfeed a leash to the core
Pisspoor, spit the raw for y'all
Fifth element adds on when I get four
Peace

What I think we've come to and what I think the tragedy clearly demonstrates; is that we now find ourselves in a world in which the arrangements of power can not yet be ignored, but in which the instruments of power no longer work. If this lesson has been told us, that the stubborn little gorillas out there, who sawed off the American giant at the knees and brought him down almost like David versus Goliath would have done a great service not only to their own cause -whatever one may think about it- but perhaps to the cause of world peace, and perhaps...",https://genius.com/Canibus-first-deployment-lyrics

Distraction is a device that tried to destroy my life

Billions of souls trapped between the negative and positive poles
I watch most people become what they loathe

Billions of verses my purpose is my focus

If you wanna save Jasper from those bloody assassins
Head-on collision crashes 'll knock you off axis
Sharpen my axe, practice, survival group classes

Before the B2 bombers wuz ordered to drop bombs on the masses
My spit is like acid, I melt metallics
Furious, fluoro, antimonikable, who's braggin'?
Paper money papyrus, burn it and trash it
It's twenty-twelve, call me no cash Onassis
The American dream
The greedy will be buried with they cream and there is no in-between
My windpipe is a weapon machine, whatever you need
Tsunami flow from seven seas that'll never recede

Selling records for ten dollars, but only a dime was mine

Get the Desert Eagle and just start hammering niggas
I should take a field trip and go camping with niggas
Turn into Charles Manson and start strangling niggas
Talk about the Blair witch and start amping the niggas
Then get it on camera while the bears mangling niggas
Stand back talking shit like it's none of my business
You didn't listen, now you got a head full of stitches
I'm an animal nigga, micro organisms swim in my saliva
Because I drink river aqua, I'm a survivor
So give thanks to the father, like the Rastas
‘Cause I believe in karma, beat you down like the brown bomber
While you scream out in horror, these people came to see a fight, not an opera
Now you got no honor, you got dropped by your record label and your sponsors
But you still go up to the office, and pretend you're on the roster
Like you're working on another project, I think you lost it
Psychological hardship, plus the new gossip
Is you homo and you swallow dick
You used to date nothing but model chicks, but you came out the closet
Now you're dealing with the problems and the politics
You the opposite of what I am
Give a pound to yourself cause I ain't shaking your hand
I'ma grown man trying to get gold by the grand
You in a wasteland pacing back and forth in the sand
That's why they hate the Canibus man, I'm better than them
In a minute I'ma be getting more cheddar than them
I'm more independent than them
So I don't care if the pothole dented my rims, I rented the Benz
The only thing I give a fuck about is lead in my pen
I'm on a higher level than them
I didn't have to sell my soul to the devil to win
The only thing I pawned is a watch, bezel the rim
Sip a cold mineral drink, smoke a couple nickels and think
What's the next move a nigga should make
Maybe I should invest in some stocks and bonds
Drive out to Vegas and stick my cock in a few broads
Princesses tongue kiss frogs
On the West Coast you can do whatever the fuck you want
That's why I moved out there, ‘cause it's cool out there
My crews out there, watch what I'ma do out there

I wanna do so many things to you
I can't talk without mentionin you
And let me tell you what I think of you

Yeah, my name is, none of your business, let me tell you why I love her
She hot when she in front but she stand behind a brother
She wiggle, her booty jiggle, my finger spreads her middle a little
Let me see what I might wanna get into
I always empower her, tell her that I'm proud of her
Show her I don't wanna make no housewife outta her
Sprinkle her with compliments, but I never shower her
That's the last thing I would do, cause I value love
She give me ounces of love, let me bounce the bum
And when she call my name, I come/cum
If I front she raise up, we fuss fight and break up
Then wake up in the Bahamas after we done made up
She know my psychological make-up
I'm therapeutic with the broad, we keep it raw when we make love
And can't nothin change the trust we have
Wherever we are, we think about the moments and laugh, because
(Chorus)

When I was on tour, I held the elevator for this broad in the lobby
Seen her later on in the bar, she sat beside me
Said the guy at the front desk recognized me
And told her all about me...
She said I heard you're a rapper, career in the crapper
I know you want some ass, you probably won't give no cash up
You should fill my glass up, tell me 'bout your bad luck
And if I feel sorry enough, I'll give you the sad fuck
I had to laugh, put my hand on my gut
I told her I'd let her have the next grand that I touched
Walked back to the elevator with my hand on her butt
To the bed with the camera in front (MONEY SHOT) cut!
I hopped up and blazed one
Yo the room and tax is paid hun, stay as long as you want
I'll be back in a hour, she said that's what they all say
I know ma, I've been sayin that all day

The valet don't remember nothin, he didn't leave the engine running
I jump in, don't bless him with nothing
Call up this other ma, she remember I'm coming
I told her I'ma cook, but I'ma just pick up something
The fireplace running, she layin on her stomach
Nasty english all in her muffin, she love it
She giggle, her booty jiggle, my finger spreads her middle a little
Let me see what I'ma get into again
I told her I don't really like to come through her block
Cause the blueberry drop attract too many cops
Girls hop in the drop, take off they top, my belt buckle pop
They know that I'm hot, can't tell me I'm not
They surrounded the car, six cops
I was holding up traffic for six blocks, they put me in the shitbox
Look at you now, I can't even come through your spot
And it's messing with my mind, cause I loved you a lot

This rhyme can outlive your whole lifetime
Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive
Surround you with a layer to the left, to the right
To the front to the back, with a rap and a mic
For satellite rappers delight, you battle for your life
You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight
The cedar wood burns, my heating is rightfully earned
I take you on a journey through the words
In the mind, hold your hand with an infinite rhyme
For a time I know it makes you shy, but that’s fine
Come along with me, let me show you how hard it can be
To spit like the 100 Bar Beast
An extra large dosage of the dopeness
How can I be anything but focused as the spitbar soldier
The rhyme equity above quota
Sometimes I go over with more bars than the beat goes for
Walk around confused, listening to tunes
Music is my muse, Can-I-Bus this abuse?
Put blades to your bones like the Autobiography of Kirk Jones
Nah, I just work for him
I will be redeemed for the destruction of the Hip Hop regime
For how it was remembered and seen
Mission requires a plan, armed personnel and staff
But tradition demands I be a more primitive man
Three standard 16s; fade the record at 3:35
Grim reaper axe, kick to your spine
Pound after pound, I come stomp on your brain
Spit fire like I drink hot sauce from a drain

When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will still remember it was done by Germaine

When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame

But?we?still?ran on the?block when we?seen cops
Constantly reminded a time when played in the water sprayed from the fire hydrant
Back when life's colours were bright and so vibrant
And every day was like a shining light wherever I went
When there was no grown-up problems and issues

What the hell happened to originality?
And there's a lot of rappers need to study on what real MCing is
?
And my advice to ? is
The reason is it could get tedious even for geniuses. (Yup)
They say it takes hard work and dedication
Maybe a little blind faith and meditation
Don't forget the culture and where it came from
Read up on your history, get you education
'Cause hip-hop starts in the heart
And is only set apat by the smarts in your art
So don't focus on the marks on the chart
But to to be a spark in the dark
And just think back...

Sharpshooter Masters,UnKnown,2008,"(Canibus)
Javelins hawk within striking distance
Alert to the sounds we hear, the rapid response verses in the air
I smell the tobacco, we know that you're here
So does the white tail buck and the black bears
What the fuck gave you the right?
To come into the wilderness just to pick a fight?
Whatever jurisdiction you from we rip mics
The B-line of blood trail in the dim light
Back to the kill site
Come here city boy, I hear you're real nice
Surrounded by dark so far from the city lights
Stop browsing, sniff downwind cowards
You pissed yourself, you smell more foul than public housing
Hardcore, parkour, tear off your car doors
Fire-breathing gargoyles, eating hyenas, charbroiled
Alien tongues long sharp but called predator claws
I rip through the Kevlar for your heart
'Till your lower body support lost
The large carnivore Spitboss Beowulf rip your torsos off
Float like the flying Albatross, part Mothman part wasp
Ambush armour transport to the marsh
Javelin Fangz, Germaine's bombing raid campaign
My hands change when I drink Beowulf bane
You ain't seen nothing nearly as strange
Blurry as alien planes, still in the frame but nearly out of range
Canines, Sons of Cain, impervious to pain
Numb off cocaine, ripping railroad tracks off trains
Deranged batshit insane, rhymes liquefy brains
Daydreaming of rain, smoke haze and stargaze
AKs spray photon rage, Sharpshooter sharp fangs
Heart pumpin' napalm through coarse veins
Speak to barmaids, breath reeks of Grand Marnier
She says, ""come on behave"", I remove my dark shades
Eyes buried behind wrinkles like Shar Peis
I got a scarface from back in my dog days
The posttraumatic microphone mechanic
Leave the habitat damaged when I rat-a-tat that ratchet
You fucking with the Sharpshooter Masters",https://genius.com/Canibus-sharpshooter-masters-lyrics

Unless you got a death wish

Women who poison the walls of they rooms with asbestos
Each stitch is treacherous

Somebody is selling it
Somewhere, somehow you get gunned down
When the guns go ""blou""

You ever met AI DAT stream 400 core processors real time hollow mixer
I'm the audio sound complexer onboard graphics can display attachments

While programs probe the unknown mold of the old

Give me Melly Mel biceps

Body armor inside the chest
Scouts dismount search hideouts from the south
I know the supply routes inside out
Timeout, sign-in wild out
The connection died out, time to sign-out
Thin recruits, black boots and ninja suits, shoot
My shot group injure two troops
I alleyoop boots on the roof
Crawl into mach suits count to two and drop through
Fit, dog shaped, chiseled from the face to my waist
SWOL like a log in the lake upstate
Custom plates rotate to one that's fake
Long enough to run to the base
Mask over the face escape, report to Peter Pace

Little birds hover in space, pick me up
We celebrate, I greet'em with a brotherly embrace

Sunny side up egg yolk on my plate

House fires, I did it with pliers, tripwires

About spiders infected with the bird virus
My investors seem bias
Half Russian submarine pirate, codename Ivan with a dive kit
Regulate pints of spit, a world underwater
My plasma stay white to the tip
Grip gravity with gloves on, enter with guns drawn
Hammer to thumb bone I'm playing the trombone
Strings unfold with a drum roll
Tell you the unofficial story Rumsfeld's sons told
I sat down, he stood up, one spoke
He had a rope tactical under his coat

My safe zone is a space dome
USA made mold brain insulated with foam
Asphalt frequent flyer, ex Navy Seal diver

Before I take it personal
One liners bust through the highway dividers on coming traffic eyes get wider powerslide ya
Spit god get the beer cap twist off sip the juice its all gone I sip hard
What you gonna do when your worst nightmare comes true?
Undergod crew comin for you
A dead corpse with exposed bones wearing cologne
Biz and Murray microphone zone sharing Patron
The fans hate cause they can’t transubstantiate what Canibus makes
The hand change shape turn in to snakes smellin the same way road kill tastes
We feed the underground undergod fan base
Nothing but steak straight chicken teriyaki shrimp lobster hibachi
Throw your face the whipping coffee make you spit up paste

Spitbullz off the muzzle, airborne off the turnbuckle
To touch you, tear bones off the muscle
Stomp you, try to get the swamp monster off you
The awful scent of bloody flesh barnacles haunt you
Couldn't kill me with a 50 cal round of three hundred fifty pound Hound with a canine growl
I scan the road from a mud hole like Rambo
The chain-fed ammo open you up like manholes
I'm Uncle Sambo with a Ku Klux Klan robe
Black face, pink lips Arctic coloured camo
Spitbullz whore let me get a fix on this fool
I drool when it’s time to get tool
Six wolves minimum, interrogate before killing them
Water board torture below zero temperature
Hot bars generate sparks, bitch, I told you don't talk
Fibrillate your heart 'til you fart
On your feet, drag you outside, march
Walk 'til your feet parched and your BDU bottoms starch
Feed you pork soaked in sodium salt
Big weapons spark like tuning forks in the dark
Won't tell you again, do not talk when we walk
Do not gawk at the corpse laying on the sidewalk
Handcuffed behind back flesh decompose and crack
Heads are detached from the respiratory tracts
Crossbow buttstock across the throat
Pardon me approach I thought you was walking too slow
No one who is able to hear will care
Those with compassionate care cannot conquer fear
The final battle won't be in space but right here
Thirty two thousand four hundred Maidenhead squares
Sharpshooter assault, Mankind versus The Land Sharks
You don't want none of the Spitbullz

When the missile is aimed to blow you out the frame
Someone still remember it was done by Germaine
In the beginning I made lyrics now lyrics make me
Your listening to Rip the Jacker to infinity
This rhyme could out live your whole lifetime
Be waiting for you on the other side when you arrive
Surround you with a layer to the left to the right to the front to the back with a rap and a mic
For satellite rappers delight you battle for your life
You battle from sunrise to off white moonlight
To see the wood burns my heating is rightfully earned
I take you on a journey through the words
And a mind hold your hand with an infinite rhyme
For a time I know it makes you shy but that's fine
Come along with me let me show you how hard it can be
To spit like the 100 bar beast

In a rock with his own thug paradise block
Watchu come back for, I came back from my rap tour pronounced rapture
Eat corn to memorialize when I was born
Blowin trees to symbolize how I spawned
Spike non ointment in an alabaster jar with a logo that resembles the mask of scar

Aliens, drop it, according to them, we do not exist
This is my race, I dictate the pace
But the law stipulates, I spit to save face
Dead in one sense, far more alive in another
Since my female vampire lover
She asked if I love her, then bit my chest
The last time I had sex with a dragon princess

Who writes the song
The latest technology platform is a robot rapper that raps bars I assemble parts down in my garage
Watergate telephone tap to your face annual spring gala
1 billion a plate no thanks man I already ate
But one day I'll be honored to have the authority to say grace Lords be gathered before you
The almighty infinite the one who created the eye in the pyramid
Time traveling and Triads custom tailoring triangles trapped in the Tetrahedron time lapse

Rippin' it, spittin' it, the quickening, the christening
Upgrading every innocent life form listening
I ain't wearing no toga to practice no yoga
Get closer breathe like an old moped motor
Pressure on the skull never had a day that was dull
You a wild boy Bis you a bull gas tank full
I'm a take em to school turn gravity upside down
Watch everybody say whoa
Type two civilization and reconciliation
10,000 bars per space shift
Im outfunded and outnumbered fighting back with nothing
My equipment is efficient but rusted
I fight to protect yours, I fight to protect my own
So why am I such a helpless soul
I did my best but my best wasn't good enough
I built a robot rapper instead of giving up
Success is failure turned inside out
Anointed the universe this is my Gods house
Fear not falling apart everything will fall into place

The metaphors are so large they marginalize Mars
Acromegaly melody's dwarf rap stars return for the rapture first contact first to contact us negotiating terms of interaction

No matter how much time is elapsed on the ground
Canibus always got that hip hop sound
Disagree to disagree until you side with me
But it's usual I end up by myself, my G
Don't be sensitive or facetious, call it how you see it
If the chips is down and it ain't around you don't need it
Vague mysterious memories hard to remember what was said to me I write so many bars intelligently
It's hard to stay motivated I'm broken in so many places
I was chasing a Tri Oasis
Till I found something amazing in me
Adjacent matrix I've been anticipating and waiting with a slave's patience
His music and Rhymes have been mutualized
Everything He does online is supervised
We study his life and we know his mind
We will use his infinite Theory in future times
But not right now right now you just say wow
Rakim Allah gave me my style
The Argon cat dose increase RTR rap G.O.A.T
If you ain't know before now you know
By mechanical or digital means I supervise emcees
From annex 1 through 10 to 13
The golden boy counts hip hop by the troy ounce
Whenever 10,000 bars is announced
Communicating with a group of beings from elsewhere
They told me human kind was on spiritual welfare
They said it's not even they fault
They were simply influenced just like you just like us all
Extraterrestrial presence, not right now
I'm studying lessons I don't even want to go in that direction
My literary creations are guided by God
Through literature and self own image, it's like that dog
What we got here is a failure to communicate
Fuck you if you don't like the music I make
I'm a God by nature, gold inside the tranquila
But they forgot Canibus, they just gave up
I came to create the first infinite song
By showing improving and letting knowledge be born
Canibus about to flow as long as he can possibly go
He built a robot to rap when he can't though
When I ain't got no more get up and go left
I struggle to take one more step, The Lord bless
Hip hop give us back our promise
Our jobs community uplifters, altruistic bars
The light emerged there's a glimmer out of a dark covenant
The dark came from nothingness
No matter what we do no matter what we say
One day we will learn the error in our ways
Doublespeak defuse us insecurities abuse us
We need to do better the world can use us
Suffering is minimized not eradicated
Sanitation squad sterilized every set to allocated
A brand-new world for the better not worse
If you dare to dream with me then mix a new verse
Celebrate the silence satisfy with song
10,000 bars why you took so long
Canibus still bussin' they still say I ain't saying nuttin
Canibus what's your major malfunction
Nothing, the heart of hip-hop still pumping
She is my beloved and I am her husband
I built a robot out of wedlock to save the world
I save the world for my beautiful girl
My baby my woman my lady my queen
She drive me crazy but she tried to glaze me
Pretty eyes the kind that glows with the eyelids close
I don't know why I allow these hoes
Baby hold on to your tampons, she crawling out of bed with crampons and nothing to land on
Kissing to kissing Ginger and Jennifer, straight genders
Touching genitals in a federal controlled experiment
I will do nothing to hurt you only to help
There's a failure to communicate, go fuck yourself
Microwave home cooked meal on the table
Bills in the mailbox they cut off the cable
I need you to fill out that W-2 for that time I paid you
Write down how much time I saved you
Talk to the lawyer for the copywriter praise on a patten
Application for this rhyme I made you
Nobody cares everybody got they own career
Rapping robots ain't paying no bills get out of my house
Don't ever come back unannounced
You don't even know what this is about
Regret speech but never silence
Justice might be one sided
That's fine I got nothing to hide then
Spatially gifted verbally Inconvenience
Love and support is all I ever needed
And when I had to go with out I was weakened
I Felt cold slowly breathing expiration is near and too close to fear
So just try to enjoy every moment you're here
Raise your children and embrace your visions
The Science of infinite theory and composition
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternalist?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x2
The Megalithic master craftsman
Closet meteorologist look at the clouds a storms coming
That's common sense Aight think about this giant monstrosity 10 W 40 blood viscosity Big enough to kill the whole colony lock and load
Get some the oil leaking from the barrel drum
I did it all for dinosaur blood
The sky is falling ocean levels rising from warming too much carbon we all know the real causes jet planes in the skies is stalling

He can rap better then me not a hard thing to do to
Cut RTR loose he gonna show everyone of you he got the juice personal revelation regarding self preservation
Daily wealth Generation and healthy meditation

The sunvisor chief analyzer H.N.I.C improviser just don't get so excited over secrets that should not be told
And you should not be so bold who are you to judge how they roll
It's a cold world yes indeed but into achieving your dreams then how can you regret what you seen
Talk to much a reason 8 reside ways 8 times
See to the lightest how long it takes me
I suggest you leave hip-hop alone for your own sake these 10,000 bars is crazy
Too few nights a sacrifice things like no sleep
He doesn't exaggerate he claims he was the first rapper in space
Ain't scared to say Rip The Jacker to your face
He was trusted but Betrayed his name led him to his grave
But not before he conquered his rage what a marvelous day gardening parsing in the shade quite a change from his militant ways
He said one reckless action can pierce life's Swartz but
The tongue of the wise will bring healing from the wars
No matter where you go there you are standing before God what does this have to do with a job
IRA 41K I need the pay right away go away
Silence day
Sade no escape for the slave
Trying to run us like jogging in place
The Gulags Are not very far away
Pompeii 7 kilometers going the wrong way
Motherfuckers we read GPS wrong all day
Meditate in a Time Machine
Mix back-and-forth with a laser beam
Screen like weapons you can beat
I concentrate everybody dreams by using a touchscreen
Billion souls trapped between The American dream
The supreme being talks to fistal and Cheba to walk between the shrubs and trees screen cause from the unseen
By a prophet a mustabeen I see project through being of the hip hop machine
Understand what I mean a bunch of fake niggas trying to create story board scenes
I will be redeemed as odd as it may seem
I need data pass theme helicopter news team try to screan
Lighting bolts stream from the heat by the beach
I transform into a beast with wide teeth tap that cheak
So why speak symptoms last for weeks
The best emcee in the world complex quoted
That that nigga is ill we globally about to preach
With a poetic masterpiece whenever the horns blow Street sweeper from the beast from the east
Till the death we are sworn to protect
Hip-hop is eternal we gotta live it till the end my friend
But I must rescind I gotta murder to attend bitch
Please be my guest die the Jacker the head bit of sweat Buddha Allah Yahweh God awd Jesus fistal cheva

Engage in battle with satan's monsters bathed in heaven water Been Allen belt holds up my boxers forever
You mother fucking bastards don't believe NASA
They just meaningless Batwas
Don't believe contractor with a asassala answers propa
The public propaganda
I am a terabeam command the fuck smell the gunpowder
Right from the Inrange spinda
The Dillinger the piece of cylinder
Move by motor the soul crush supernova
We underground Warriors
The shoulder I shoot with is separated stupid you think
You got a better shot than me then do it now you got the juice stop the music silence I want you to hear what the truth is I
Wanna see humankind rise I wanna see it with my own eyes
I wanna see racism stop
I want aliens to listen to hip-hop haters misquote rhymes brought turpentine down the throats let them choke with the bamboo vines
Arnold Schwarzenegger movies screen casualty count between him and slyStone they going to carry you out
No doubt overhead a wax wipe
The whole place off the map no excessive force just rap
What kind of life you got it
You see me here rhyming with this robot
You know a brother love hip-hop
Love overboard chopped it with a high winter fog
Probably never make it back to shore
The worlds crowded but I feel alone
I'm always be there for you turns to you now you on your own
A life of service nowhere near a politician perfect
I'm glad your wife is a strong person I'm a forget you
But not if you special
Especially if indiscriminately unsettled
Wherever you at that's what you settled
Public program policy pussy
The pedal metaphors melt metal morphed into something that can be used by rebels to test
Corporate Devils widhda jaw Briggs fuck you you are all dead man walking talking bout you awesome terabytes the lyrics
Shadow bites the spirits
Some criticize it some like to hear it regulatory
Tell em the story do you have the right to remain silent Charley I'm sorry please stop talking strength in vitality
The Arawak Indians dance for me because I commanded it to be
I pluck triggers like ukaladies with the strings missing
Wasn't ever into no ray kissing
Biological rhythms always watching the bottom of women
My hair on the cleopatras my kitten
When the invitation is given do not go
The hair and nails of the undead do not grow
I ain't got enough teeth to properly eat meat
I can't barbecue cause property ain't cheap construction cost per square foot either we got to stay put
Or we got a fine somewhere els to cook when I'm satisfied
I'll deliver take the arrow out of the quiver RTR said battle me
Nigga x-ray vision night goggle ripper block Google on Twitter while harness horn pigeons biohazard contingence
All living organic conditions maybe this'll put your symptoms back in remission
Spitting so much things we don't know taking place
But dey taking care of everything every day
Liar birds mimic my voice The hardest thing to avoid
Turns out to be the simplest choice
I'm the Deepwater dread till you get it through your motherfucking head
One day you'll remember what I said
What happens when 7 Billion minds couldn't Match the mind of one cause
Shan solar flares coming from the sun composition
None of your business so what are you thinking

I activate telepathic ability verbian verbal net worth all work people deeply get hurt
Completely and scorned stem my work call God curse
Colder than a heart of a murk
Close like a label less childbirth
It takes place below the dirt
The key makes a turn let it be turned
A new man emerge badly burned smells like a bag of herb vision is getting blurred
Awoke sound scientifically superb every verse is well heard
Perform a cappella surgery you rep TV surf sand

Shan 50 the light bearer the rhyme with devine layers
Fly Robin fly so you can get shot out the sky that's a copout Nice try 10,000 bars that means I'm a part of rap music forever but I don't know if I want that pressure
That's why I built a robot to live out the legacy
Rip the robot is the best MC
My condense stealth detention is nothing RTR is under construction
I can't wait till RTJ press the button like inspected gun ship zone dumping maintained in a holding pattern Altitude above cloud cover range all the way out to Pluto and back again
And by the time this gets back rap won't exist it'l have to be rediscover the history of it is not very uncovered
J to the blue-collar public accepted applauded reward it at sun down
Sheeple be snorted unless the blood of lamb make an offer
We do not to negotiate with any enemy elements
Dragon snake eagle rat donkey or elephant Music for the meditated therapist they call me a heretic
But poet laureate never quit it's been saved
Yeah I'll battle you and reinvest the finance Capital
And build a robot to out rap you
Now that's what I call of real rap star
Six point facemask of the Jaguar
Shan51 keep flying around in the talphasphere

Iceberg Slick Phonecall,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aiyo Sarge, my SuperFriend's Dodge in the yard
Don't say a fucking word to me just nod
I came, I see
Then I'ma bust him in the jaw if he fuck with me
MC cbc, atl, ebe
Mickey D sign, he see me
I see more depth than Imhotep
I see no death, that's why I ain't no hero yet
Translate the text I throw scrolls you fetch
My style is not even something unknown yet
I'm a SuperFriend, come through in a stupid Benz
Look at the roof, you see blue wind
That where the tape ends but a new loop begins
I can't believe what they do for ends
Nigga nuck if you buck, cap if you puck
I bust out of these cuffs, grab your ass up
Reach for the light, I'ma show you despite
You can X-Ray my hand and see me holding a mic",https://genius.com/Canibus-iceberg-slick-phonecall-lyrics
Loose With It,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Born, raised, corns what I eat when I graze
Served to me on gold trays
Sip grape haze, sunny days, ocean waves
Always with a bird on those days
In the cantina with a canteen of green
Yea, me and my team they think we from Queens
Evisu jeans, white Nikes with white wings
If the recoil springs, the snake bite stings
Bow before what the great light brings
Lightning makes the sky look stripe-pinned
Cranial capacity 2500 cc, you could rap but you can't see me
My emotions echo, I let go into the threshold
I grin, my limbs get cold
Death to any and all who disrespect lyrical law
That's the main motor jaw protocol
Here's my software load it all
Questions? Anytime after 11:34's good to call
The graveyard watch, I still believe in hip hop
It's just changed so much that it's not...
The same, I ask myself, ""Am I still Germaine?""
Le's not go through that again
The name Can-I-Bus, my music career seems stuck
But I'm the only one it can trust, shut up let me buss
Rhymes will engulf the sun, which in turn will engulf us
I called because, I had to tell you
What to do when your resources fail you
Banned from the internet, can't e-mail you
I put it in a rhyme, the details'll scare you
IQ boosters for IPod computers
My job is to preserve yours and my future
Special Ops Day, fast rope out of an Osprey
I got mustard wings the odd way
With God's grace, I served hip hop and was not replaced
At least not to my face
Now I'm all alone, drinkin' Patron
From a bowl shaped like skull and bones
Your man not home, leave a message after the tone
Don't call back until you massacre a poem
I exhale weed smoke, build a dream boat in the placebo
With Captain Nemo and three hoes
Fine little fraulein', soon she'll be all mine
I pour wine to shorten the fourplay time
She turned to me slow like, ""Honey, where will we go?""
I proposed it was best she didn't know
Verbal psycho-neural, she said, ""I never heard of you
Your words are purposeful, I might learn a few""
Special collection service, track down every beat purchased
Researchers read my incomplete verses
The verses were first-string, left wing, second wind and combined, created a third thing
My heartbeat ends when the Devil and God become friends
The hip hop tribunal will begin
Cry for the crisis negotiator codename Major Omega, crisis situation in the bodega
Gun bolt long as a trombone, the weapon itself big as Mutombo, them niggas was humble
Practical things like tactical slings, LBV retractable springs
D-rings pinch my clavicle skin
Stay in the underground bases, excuse the decor
Everybody leave your body armor at the door!
I drop rhymes like rockslides, the seismic size compromise lives but not mine
I find time to regroup and switch suits
While they shoot from a stone-proof booth with no roof
My flow is the truth, a hip hop glucose boost
And everybody else know it too
Step forward touch the speaker, activate the DNA reader
Looks like we got us a tweaker
Atomic, ganglionic, chronic, microphone hydroponics
With incompetent psycho content
The lone inventor, the experimenter of a scientific splendor
That will always be remembered",https://genius.com/Canibus-loose-with-it-lyrics
Killed,UnKnown,2010," x2

Y'all know the sound when I come up out the crowd
And I tear the shit down, and ya show just got killed

You gon fuck around and make me bust a round
Hold my niggas down, anyone else will get killed
Y’all know the sound when I come up out the crowd
And I tear the shit down, and ya show just got killed

One thousand and one, Mahtie Bush, Canibus, hardcore Hip-Hop, that's what we want
Styles one thousand and one, Mahtie Bush, Canibus, hardcore Hip-Hop, that's what we want (2x)
Styles one thousand and one, Mahtie Bush, Canibus, hardcore Hip-Hop, tell ’em what you want


 x2
You gon fuck around and make me bust a round
Hold my niggas down, anyone else will get killed
Y'all know the sound when I come up out the crowd
And I tear the shit down, and ya show just got killed

We can perceive anything
Cuz there is a time and a space for everything

I'm under twenty four hour restraint
I meditate for twenty three hours and fifty nine minutes then take a break
My body is ground-based, my soul is probably in outer space
Go hard in the paint, 'till I faint
I tell 'em what it is, they think about what it ain't
The reality they create would not let them escape
The average Hip-Hop head got Avatar legs
The intellect spreads, now they see what I said
Rise, raise your right hand
Grab the mic off the mic stand, memorize rhymes like a hype man
There is no light on the cam
Darkness falls over the land
Frozen in trance, chosen by chance
The rebel that blast metal, three hundred sixty degree swivel
Three eighty, sacramental special
Backpack on mental metal
The singularity sentinel sent through the Stargate bezel made a crystal to tell you
Something simple, and try to prepare you
They restrain you because they fear you
Be careful or turn into a werewolf, I dare you
They restrain you because they fear you",https://genius.com/Canibus-killed-lyrics
Rip the Jacker 2 Infinity,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The body is the surface of the mind we got infinite power
This is a story?of?a man that?was before his time
In this journey?you're the journal, I’m the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x3
My soul was created ten thousand years before my body
This album is a physical copy through the light forms
I've been ethically upgraded to live at least twice as long
Who writes the song
The latest technology platform is a robot rapper that raps bars I assemble parts down in my garage
Watergate telephone tap to your face annual spring gala
1 billion a plate no thanks man I already ate
But one day I'll be honored to have the authority to say grace Lord be gathered before you
The almighty infinite the one who created the eye in the pyramid
Time traveling Triads custom tailoring triangles trapped in the Tetrahedron time lapse
They labeled me a loser
Germains online observer graphic layering entropy computer metaphor styles, astronomer royale
Tesla coils around thor borns to separate clouds
Williams the conqueror defender of the realm
The adenine Warcry in the pits of hell
Rippin’ it, spittin' it, the quickening, the christening
Upgrading every innocent life form listening
I ain't wearing no toga to practice no yoga
Get closer breathe like an old moped motor
Pressure on the skull never had a day that was dull
You a wild boy Bis you a bull gas tank full
I'm a take em to school turn gravity upside down
Watch everybody say whoa
Type two civilization and reconciliation
10,000 bars per spaceship
Im outfunded and outnumbered fighting back with nothing
My equipment is efficient but rusted
I fight to protect yours, I fight to protect my own
So why am I such a helpless soul
I did my best but my best wasn't good enough
I built a robot rapper instead of giving up
Success is failure turned inside out
Anointed the universe this is my Gods house
Fear not falling apart everything will fall into place
When you organize a Crossfade bars
The metaphors are so large they marginalize Mars
Acromegaly melody's dwarf rap stars return for the rapture first contact first to contact us negotiating terms of interaction
A chronic humanoids into breeding the land mammals keynote speakers reference PowerPoint examples
Check out my hermetic poetic planetarium
The alien came out of a female mammalian
Through cesarean and Burying bioluminescent aquariums in a self-sustaining black light solarium
Then after that, I live forever, you disagree?
You can't deny RTJ Infinity!
In this journey you're the journal, I’m the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off
Canibus x2
No matter how much time is elapsed on the ground
Canibus always got that hip hop sound
Disagree to disagree until you side with me
But it’s usual I end up by myself, my G
Don't be sensitive or facetious, call it how you see it
If the chips is down and it ain’t around you don't need it
Vague mysterious memories hard to remember what was said to me I write so many bars intelligently
It's hard to stay motivated I'm broken in so many places
I was chasing a Tri Oasis
Till I found something amazing in me
Adjacent matrix I’ve been anticipating and waiting with a slave's patients
His music and Rhymes have been neutralized
Everything He does online is supervised
We study his life and we know his mind
We will use his infinite Theory in future times
But not right now right now you just say wow
Rakim Allah gave me my style
The Argon cat dose increase RTR rap G.O.A.T
If you ain't know before now you know
By mechanical or digital means I supervise emcees
From annex 1 through 10 to 13
The golden boy counts hip hop by the troy ounce
Whenever 10,000 bars is announced
Communicating with a group of beings from elsewhere
They told me human kind was on spiritual welfare
They said it's not even they fault
They were simply influenced just like you just like us all
Extraterrestrial presence, not right now
I'm studying lessons I don't even want to go in that direction
My literary creations are guided by God
Through literature and self own image, it's like that dog
What we got here is a failure to communicate
Fuck you if you don't like the music I make
I'm a God by nature, gold inside the trachea
But they forgot Canibus, they just gave up
I came to create the first infinite song
By showing improving and letting knowledge be born
Canibus about to flow as long as he can possibly go
He built a robot to rap when he can't though
When I ain't got no more get up and go left
I struggle to take one more step, The Lord bless
Hip hop give us back our promise
Our jobs community uplifters, altruistic bars
The light emerged there's a glimmer out of a dark covenant
The dark came from nothingness
No matter what we do no matter what we say
One day we will learn the error in our ways
Doublespeak defuse us insecurities abuse us
We need to do better the world can use us
Suffering is minimized not eradicated
Sanitation squad sterilized every set to allocated
A brand-new world for the better not worse
If you dare to dream with me then mix a new verse
Celebrate the silence satisfy with songs
10,000 bars why you took so long
Canibus still bussin' they still say I ain't saying nothing
Canibus what's your major malfunction
Nothing, the heart of hip-hop still pumping
She is my beloved and I am her husband
I built a robot out of wedlock to save the world
I save the world for my beautiful girl
My baby my woman my lady my queen
She drive me crazy but she tried to glaze me
Pretty eyes the kind that glows with the eyelids close
I don't know why I allow these hoes
Baby hold on to your tampons, she crawling out of bed with crampons and nothing to land on
Kissinger kissing Ginger and Jennifer, straight genders
Touching genitals in a federal controlled experiment
I will do nothing to hurt you only to help
There's a failure to communicate, go fuck yourself
Microwave home cooked meal on the table
Bills in the mailbox they cut off the cable
I need you to fill out that W-2 for that time I paid you
Write down how much time I saved you
Talk to the lawyer for the copywriter praca on a patten
Application for this rhyme I made you
Nobody cares everybody got they own career
Rapping robots ain't paying no bills get out of my house
Don't ever come back unannounced
You don't even know what this is about
Regret speech but never silence
Justice might be one sided
That's fine I got nothing to hide then
Spatially gifted verbally Inconvenience
Love and support is all I ever needed
And when I had to go with out I was weakened
I Felt cold slowly breathing expiration is near and too close to fear
So just try to enjoy every moment you're here
Raise your children and embrace your visions
The Science of infinite theory and composition
In this journey you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal? Or an eternaline?
Cause every time I stop I seem stuck soon as you try to step off

The Illest,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I grind, I scramble, I put them both together and gramble
Bag up the gram, separate the samples
The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to
My lyrics lynch you, give you something to hang to
Your fans mourn, mumbling your song
While the Son of Sam prepares for war
My hands form ram horns
Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly
Sadly he's not too punchy, but still jabby
Stick and move keep stepping, follow my reflection
Demolition any nigga disrespecting the profession
Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction
Is there ever enough protection? The quintessential question
Unroll your maps I'ma show you where we at
Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps
You heard of that, my sandbag leak worser than that
The cowboy going to church with a curve in his hat",https://genius.com/Canibus-the-illest-lyrics
