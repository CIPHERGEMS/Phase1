Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)

Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor

Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue

My Brother,A Gangster and a Gentleman,2002.0,"(Answering machine): I'm not the only one living here
Please be considerate and leave a nice message after the tone. One!
(Styles): I just wanted to speak to him.... I got too much words...
I got a lot of words... let's see.. yo, yo

Life is a circle of pain
The darkest clouds, end up like the purplest rain
They say patience is a virtue in the game
Fuck it, I guess I died when my brother died
Cause to tell you the truth, I feel like I'm the curse in the game
My vision is blurred, dreams is shattered, my heart is broke
Pain so deep I find it hard to cope
Missin' your smile and missin' your style
I figured I'm the next one dead so we could kick it a while
Cause your name lives on, the sun still shine
Every time your baby mom lift up your child
I guess I gotta switch my angle now
Take a positive look, hit a blunt my little brother's with the angels now
Some of us fall and some of us fly
But at the end of the book baby all of us die
Word, my nigga

There's my brother
I could smile, cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophets and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin' the sky
There's my brother
I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more
I said there's my brother, with Allah
Best place he could be

If I could get my miracle on
Listen to me, I would bring my brother back in the physical form
Cause the spirit still here, but the visual gone
And sometimes I gotta think if I'mma live to the morn
I guess it's no more schooling you
I know it's something in our blood, that kept us niggas in the street as usual
Left with a robbery charge, pack and a stash
Crushed a lot of niggas that'd happened to gav
But I'mma just light a blunt, look in the clouds
And I'mma ask my little nigga what's happening Hav
You died on Mother's Day, mom it's a gift
I know God took my brother cause his honor and strength
And we all gonna die Allah tally us up
While you there say what's up to Lil Malla and Duck
And I know y'all niggas restin' in peace
You might be gone, but your soul is still here and is blessin' the streets

There's my brother (My niggas)
I could smile, cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophet and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin' the sky
There's my brother (My brother)
I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more
I said there's my brother, with Allah
Best place he could be

I could see you when I'm all alone (I see you)
So I guess I'm not all alone, I know my little nigga callin' home
The good die young, so they could get to heaven early
And watch over the rest of the slums (watch over us please)
Move the clouds so we could see the rest of the sun
You might've died, but you in heaven that's a blessing in one
Nigga robbin' to the death, Gary died with a close friend
You and Allen together, smiling together
It's like now I could hear the world
I understand that, I'm in the physical, you're in the spirit world
I see you when I get home
They can't separate brothers, so I still see you when the spit flowin
You died, I died ( you still here)
But I'm alive, you alive, so we gotta keep the shit going
Now I got a new ghost
And a baby brother angel I could feel, every time the wind blows

There's my brother (My niggas)
I could smile, cause I know he right next to Allah
Right next to the prophet and the soldiers that died
And all the angels in the heaven that be holdin' the sky
There's my brother (My brother)
I could cry, for the fact I can't hug him no more
But my tears go to heaven and I know the nigga feel me
And the good thing is he ain't got to worry no more

I said there's my brother
This is where all the people we lost
Right here, they ain't goin' no where
It's all love
This is just the first right daddy
The next one is the next one
Do the best you could, hold your head
You know; you lose somebody, you gain a angel",https://genius.com/Styles-p-my-brother-lyrics

The Life,A Gangster and a Gentleman,2002.0,"My life, Pharoahe Monch, Ayatollah
Howard Mcduffy, Holiday Styles, Double R, Rawkus Records
Pharoahe talk to 'em
Let 'em try to understand
Let 'em try, let 'em try now

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life

Is based on lightin' blunts, loadin' guns
Tellin' my lawyers to get the case gone
I need the bills that the presidents got they face on
So I could switch my residence
Get a truck and a Lex
Fuck a check, I no longer have to wait for 'em
I made a couple ends, lost a couple friends
I light a blunt 'cause never will the struggle end
So you could judge a nigga, but you ain't got it
You ain't in the role, so you really can't budge a nigga
You oughta love a nigga
For the fact that it's my world and my life but still I'm a rugged nigga
They say, ""You buggin' nigga,"" fuck it, I'm a thuggin' nigga
You talkin' bullshit then kick it with another nigga
I got a bigger bed and I need a cover nigga
And I ain't got friends, I got enemies
So if they wit' me, then that means they my brother nigga

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life
My life

Is a blunt to the head, a prayer for the dead
Run around hustlin', scared of the feds
They said, ""Death is eternal sleep""
But the only thing is you ain't really sure if you prepared for the bed
So often we get merc'd in the head, instead of big money
They got big momma hurtin' instead
My life is makin' the verse
But the handcuffs, the bullpens, the jail cells is makin' it worse
Tell mommy I don't go to the church
Tell Oc' I dont' go to mosque
I blow blunts, hold guns, and I'ma be right there when the soldiers'll march
I play my part and my heart seem colder than March
But on the flipside of things, it's still warmer than June
I have talks with the Lord and he'll be callin' me soon, what?
And my life is all I have
My family, my niggas, my flow, my grabs, what?

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it through the struggle, don't judge me
What you say now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from, so often
People you grew up with are layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife

A Gangster and a Gentleman,A Gangster and a Gentleman,2002.0,"Yes, pay full attention
This is for gangstas, this is for gentlemen
There's two kind of people out there
I happen to be the boss type
I'm a product of my environment
Blame the streets, I am what they made me

My pops came from Bed-Stuy, my mom came from Africa
I'm all nigga if you know what I mean
They hooked up in the '70's when liquor and weed was heavy
And had me in Corona, Queens
By the time I was seven my mom left my pop
Then we moved to the south side of Yonkers, New York
Then my mom remarried, had my little brother Gary
My sister a year later, let me gather my thoughts
By the time I was nine I was outta my mind
My step pops didn't like me beat me outta my mind
Ten and eleven? the same, I never would change
He still had to hit me, aggravate a little nigga
Still wearin' Skippys
Garf had Adidas and Pumas, I coulda had a pair
But Mommy said wait 'til Christmas, but I needed 'em sooner
If you heard I was broke, dawg it wasn't a rumor

I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me)
Gentlemen live your life (Live it up)
Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die)
It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin)

It was 1986 and I was twelve years old
That's right around the time when crack came out
It was the best thing that happened to me
I swear to God cause I was gettin everything that I was askin' about
First we started off baggin up, me and Garf
Then shit start addin up, we gettin smart
Now we on Broadway, coppin' our own base
Bring it home and put it in bottles, sit in Serato
Drink an OE and scramble like it wasn't tomorrow
I'm gettin kicked out of Junior High, thinkin' I'm grown
Garf bust with the yellow rabbit
And I had every color Delt we was gettin' it on
I was out robbin' Mexicans six in the morn'
Mom said I had a F again, riffin' I'm gone
Nigga get a little looted and grown, soup in the dome
Fuck me up worst when I went to the group home

I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me)
Gentlemen live your life (Live it up)
Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die)
It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin)

I'm leavin out a lotta shit, nigga it's too real
My alcoholic backround, the welfare motels
Abuse that I had to take struggle at my mom's recruit
How the fuck I'm gon bond wit you
And the cases I got up to date told you that I bust a eight
Got niggas I can't name, outta state niggas fuck with weight
Little brother gone but I got a baby angel
You fuckin with a dirty name, don't let these niggas change you
The present's what you get
And the past is what make the man future
I can't tell you I ain't God or lil' Superman
No there ain't a 'S' on my chest, but it's a 'D' on my block (D-Block)
'Cause in life the deepest lesson is death
I'm determined and I'm disciplined and destined to rest
I'm a Gangsta and a Gentleman, Panero the best
When I pass I'm like gas, motherfuckers
Cause I'm a leave a stain that you'll never forget

I said Gangstas ride (Ride with me)
Gentlemen live your life (Live it up)
Cause Gangstas die (We all gon die)
It's only a matter of time (The clock tickin)

This gangsta and this gentleman shit, is about being humble
But at the same time, let niggas know what's real
And when I say you real, I could flip
But at the same time, I could talk to a nigga at the same time
If he don't respect that, then you gotta show 'em you're gangsta
He respect that you show 'em you're gentleman
Cause you respect him as a man
That's what a gangsta and a gentleman is about",https://genius.com/Styles-p-a-gangster-and-a-gentleman-lyrics
The Ghost,The Ghost in the Machine,UnKnown,"Spend a day with the Ghost baby
Get the understandin'
I'm like a shadow
I'm the ghost of this shit for all the spirits I possess
All the voices I be hearin', shit I'm feelin' in my chest
I could ghost through your walls and flow through your soul
When it comes to the streets dog I give this shit my all and
If I'm not grabbin' y'all, if you into signs then
I'm a Sagittarius, the magician is my tarot card
David is my first name but love it if you break it down
I'm a real nigga, I'm a hug you if you breakin' down
Styles is my last name meaning the expression of art
I guess why I'm just blessed with the heart
And they call me Holiday, I'm a let the blanks fill in
I call myself that cause I was born on Thanksgiving
11-28-74
Snatch you, will I break bread with niggas that was ghetto or poor
P. short for Peniro, that's a mixture of Robert and Al
But I ain't actin' with a llama, I'm wild
Here's why they call me the ghost
I'm half alive, half dead, and when it's beef I bring all of the toast
I'm the ghost of this shit, I provide you fluid
That'll crack the sidewalks and rise the sewers
Hey yo, I can see my son in my face
Am I foul cause I pray when I'm high or with a gun on my waist
Gots to ride for the criminals, die for the generals
My ghost'll be around for my bicentennial
Y'all better do the article
Cause when I'm dead I ain't really gon' die, I'm gon' break down to particles
Probably too deep to blow
When I sleep I leave earth and come back, y'all can't peep the ghost
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers'll sink
And y'all niggas can't walk with me, I'm on some different shit
I can't explain it but I hear the clouds talk to me
It's sort of like the weed in a dutch, you wouldn't understand
So I stay quiet not leavin' you much
It's about time I even it up, I knock your spirit out
Holiday to Ghost gettin' greasy as fuck
Here's why they call me the ghost
I'm half alive, half dead, and when it's beef I bring all of the toast
I'm the ghost of this shit, I provide you fluid
That'll crack the sidewalks and rise the sewers
I vow to hold my niggas down, bust my gun, pay the bail
Get the weed, get the liquor, dog I'm just a lick of styles
Lyrically I'm somethin' else, hardest out of nothin' else
Before you think I'm bitch you better all try to fuck yourself
Mr. Paniro and, mixed with a pharoe and
Got cold hearted when I started movin' heroin
Robbed more shit than Billy the Kid
You think you're nicer than the P you the silliest kid
It's like I'm better off poppin' ya
When I flow I got a formula in styles sort of like a philosipher
Y'all start borrowin' lessons
Cause rap without me is like the gods without the stars and the crescents
I don't rap my niggas, I spit bars and baptize niggas
Pull guns and kill half-sized niggas
You heard about the Holy Ghost and took it for lies
Next time you see Paniro just look in his eyes nigga
Here's why they call me the ghost
I'm half alive, half dead, and when it's beef I bring all of the toast
I'm the ghost of this shit, I provide you fluid
That'll crack the sidewalks and rise the sewers",https://genius.com/Styles-p-the-ghost-lyrics

But fuck it, thats why I'm the ghost

Sheek Louch
]
I'm about to open up, listen
One day I fell asleep and my knife woke me up
He said, ""
Your gun is in the closet flippin'
Talkin' 'bout I get the most action he about to soak me up
""
So I went to the closet said, ""Hammer what's wrong with you?""
""
You ain't busting me off, it's like I don't belong to you
""
I said I just beat a case, daddy
And I'm tryna take it easy 'cause I gotta move this weight, daddy
Then the hammer said, ""
Man, listen, use the knife twice in a row
Tell me if the plan switchin'
'Cause we used to get around together
We used to put niggas down together, tell me if it's now or never
""
I said, ""Hammer, take it easy, baby
'Cause I got niggas to kill and I would never do you greasy, baby
And all you gotta do is chill a while
And then the hammer said, ""
Cool
 'cause you know that I feel you, Styles""

I got a story to tell, my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell, my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me
I got a story to tell, my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell, my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me

J-Hood

My knife said to me
""
I hawk niggas down, bust arteries
""
And he get bright red for me
Knife, you my nigga, but leave me alone
I got to talk to my man haze to get in the zone
I said ""Haze what the hell is up?""
He said, ""
You know how we do, you know that we crew
So where's the vanilla dutch?
""
Rollin' somethin' up
Think about killin' every rapper in the game and holdin' somethin' up
My haze said to me, ""
You need to calm down when the rage come to you
'Fore a grave or a cage or a gauge come to you
But you don't give a fuck
So just open up your book and let your page come to you""
Even though I'm humble and noble, I don't give a fuck
You ain't tryna hear me, I'ma shoot through your mobile
It's funny y'all squabble
Hold up, my niggas, it ain't a convo 'less your money start talkin'

I got a story to tell, my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell, my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me
I got a story to tell, my haze talk to me
But nobody believe that my haze talk to me
I got a story to tell, my money talk to me
But nobody believe that my money talk to me

My money spoke to me
It said shit that if it wasn't for his ass there wouldn't be no hope for me
Money ain't everything, and then he laughed at me
And said the hammer oughta blast at me
He said I got you out of jail, paid for the lawyer and bail
Take a look at the cars and the crib
I keep the clothes on your back, food in your mouth
Even paid for the birds when you moved niggas south
Shit, I'm the reason why the block jumpin'
Let a nigga try to stop something, D-Block'll pop somethin'
And I'm the reason why you ride or die
Keep a lot of me by your side, shoot niggas in the eye
I said, ""Money you the root of evil
How they print 'In God We Trust' knowin' what you do to people?""
But I'm a hard felon
So I grabbed two stacks, dirty and bloody 'cause I heard my car yellin'

I got a story to tell, my knife talk to me
But nobody believe that my knife talk to me
I got a story to tell, my hammer talk to me
But nobody believe that my hammer talk to me

To discuss a little business with him and the homey Rozay
Know the situation transpired where a nigga had to get dealt with a little harshly
Yeah

Root for the villain and shoot with no feelin'
Like Audio Two yeah the crew is ""Top Billin""
Blowin' the dutch in the coupe with no ceilin'
Invisible bully like the Gooch when I'm illin'
Cash too green, it's taped to the toilet

Young black Vito, chopped and wrapped kilos
Clap torpedoes, stack, Doritos
We in the Mexico sippin' the Mojito
Discussin' perico, green weed and diesel
AK muzzle air holes you can see through
Ridin' the bulletproof five, yeah, I'm lethal

Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH)
Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH)
Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH)
And like a Rothschild with money that's why I'm (HARSH)
How we dealin' with 'em? (HARSH) How we dealin' with 'em? (HARSH)
How we handlin' em? (HARSH) How we manglin' 'em? (HARSH)

Money from the door and then when I bop with two chicks
It won't stop never stop there he go again
Together watch the coke and have the baking soda blend
Fredricka kinda pure see how we make the fiends flock
And watch the lines for the coke a quickly wrap around the block
They say we bad for business cause the coke price dropped
How we flooded and we bubble white 'til it's white hot
Pot purchases we chop it up to pieces
'Til only the shake is left countin' the profit in Ibiza
Eight million dollar yacht, scotch, a little refer
Diamonds so big they call it obnoxious little creature
Money to cop original paintings of Mona Lisa
High the way I feel a cloud sittin' on my Caesar

Holiday (2000),The Great Ones Pt. 3,2000.0,"Yeah
L-O-X nigga
It don't stop
It keep goin, and goin, and goin, and goin
Motherfuckers

You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth
I get you kidnapped, and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap
Cause when these bullets hit yo' ass, I'm like it's only a gat
I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hoping it's yours
Think he religious, Heard he got shot in the Cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the Porsche, or flip to the boots, stick to the truth
Do anything it takes just to get me this loot
And missing a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze ain't no controlling the wrist
And niggas leave the room when they hear the P flowing to Swizz
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga
If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than y'all
If I left the gun home, I'm a give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

 Uh huh, holiday
 I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
 Holiday
 And I don't care if I sell, y'all know what I sell
 Holiday
 I use my left hand when I'm loading the shells
 Holiday
 Cause I know it ain't right, that's why I'm blowing the 'L

Yo...
I do it all for my niggas, even ride with a bomb
Get shot, die in his arm, and give him my last
It's a million dollar bail, I'm a get it in cash
I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun, live in the Maz'
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like Malibu and pineapple, fifties of hash
Hundreds of 'dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard
But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Getting jewels from the old timers, stashing the cards
But jail ain't part of the plans
I keep weight on the scale cause I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut
I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes
Double R now bitch you oughta know I'm a ghost
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke",https://genius.com/Styles-p-holiday-2000-lyrics

You fuckin with my soul right here
All night
I don't really care what I sell or what I sold
As long as I give my soul whenever my story told
I don't know how you roll but I roll, all alone
In the zone knowin damn well my little brother home
Still feel him in the passenger seat
I can't see him and I wish that he can chatter with me
In due time until then, you can say I got more than a few rhymes
Thought I'd be there to see him like more than a few times
Tryin to stay away from beef, but shit is gettin deep
I ain't restin right, it's like I'm on layaway for sleep
I think I shoulda been a author or somethin
Disappear like Hoffa or somethin, came back when they offer me somethin
My word I, got a little crust in my third eye
Headache's why I be meditatin; thoughts is devastatin
Could this be my last life? Maybe my past life?
Is the future when I'm sleep? So what was last night?
I'm goin in deep - and you know the Ghost

{""Alone in the street""} One two three four
5 o'clock in the mornin, you know I'm tryin to see more
{""Alone in the street""} All day, all night
All by myself, you know that I'm all right
{""Alone in the street""} Seven eight nine ten eleven
12 PM, you know I'm tryin to get it in
{""Alone in the street""} All day, all night

Mad live, could learn to bounce out on a bad vibe
Or either keep a gun in your cab ride
Have I thought about my life as a bad guy?
Made a little money sellin rocks that was capsized
Robbed a lot of people like I never was baptized
Yeah I was a very young teen when I took my shahadah
But got right off my deen when I could book the Ramada
Cause I'd rather be a robber or a midnight marauder
There's a part of me that love bein gangster, all of me
I couldn't help but get in the game, the shit was callin me
And I think that I was callin it back
But you can't help but trip when you fall in the trap
If the Lord call, who got the phone for callin him back?
Things are man-made, why don't you tell man to do that?
But he can't, so I'mma stay on the spiritual flack
Cause it's a uphill battle when I'm dealin with that


Consider this a sermon, start to burnin
Never said you was hard, I ain't give you the permit
I might think you vermin, better yet vomit
Alone in the streets with the gun by the armpit
Can't put a shark with a pawn fish, it's conflict
Sorta like mixin boy scouts with the convicts
Somebody gon' pay if somebody gon' play
Cause the streets cold-hearted on a hot summer day
If you gon' rap please stop, run away
Go home, flush ya crack then, give ya gun away
Cause the rules is written down, in invisible ink
Just consider what the critical think
Don't rat, do your bid in the clink; stand tall lil' boy
Get yourself a shrink if you're feelin you're paranoid
But real talk, fuck jail talk, I know home's sweet
Even locked down in a cage is where your dome be

If my man gonna ride I'm gonna set it with him
If ya man gonna die, you gettin deaded with him
When you hear my verses, it was never written
And If you don't like my shit, don't never listen
But if you tuned in, make room then
Guns in every closet, even the one the brooms in
Just like them cameras, see that money and zoom in
Get it, then I zoom out (laughs)
And they think I'm blowin' smoke out
I'm really blowin' fumes out, howl when the moons out
It's the alpha male, is my brain locked up or is it out on bail
Am I free yet? Can I see yet??

Me, my gun, my knife, always stay in sync
I know shit stinks, but keep ya nose up
Me, I hold the block like the belt hold ya clothes up
I see his head down, and his toes up
They'll plant him, but he never grows up
You don't wanna stumble now, it's a jungle now
Large ain't big enough, headed for humongous now
And If you head up, they'll gun you down
They don't give a fuck if ya daughter or ya son around

With a lot of cash to hold out
Cause I know bout what I know bout, nigga no doubt

Dance with the devil in a den (I dance)
I'm a soul of the earth, I can transform the wind

When you let 'em in the cypher then the cancer begins
My man said he God body, I told him I'm God soul (I'm God soul)
On my mind, do a chariot come with a console?
Think it a paradise 'cause niggas is parasites
Vampire suck your blood right under the candle light
Back on my Ghost shit, my nigga was Phantom Knight
Got wiser off the bud but it wasn't from Anaheim
Get this blood money dirty, my hands is sanitized
Keep my eyes on the prize, not things that tantalize

The answer is get murdered 'cause I'm tryin' to get further (ha)
There's niggas who sell drugs but they won't flip a burger
Shit, I was there, too, nigga, I don't care to (I don't care)
Still crack the ground but now I move the air too (I make the air move)
Ride of my life but I ain't got spare room (ride)
No spare tire, the truth it's a rare lie (rare)

Live by the code of honor, stay holdin armor

Stay bustin a hammer, sweatin a smile
And I make sure these motherfuckers'll regret while I'm wildin

Get blood on the driver face, window and dash
Burn the car with the body in it, bring you the ash

Understand I was raised on some other shit
What's the pain to ya?
What's the name to ya?
What's shame to ya? What's the game and the fame to ya?
These is the questions that I ask myself
Like the haze and the hashy for help
Or Courvoisier straight
A parking lot full of thugs and parking there late

It is the key to all the doors

Make moves but take time like a chess piece
Before I start the car, four dimes to the chest piece
Windows ain't the only things tinted
Niggas is too, I been tryna blow but it might take me a minute
Shit, time is money though
I'm on the low, but my ghost acting funny though
He saying chill nigga, now you could build or you could kill, nigga?
That depend on your will, nigga
My reply, it's the thrill, nigga
I be seeking adventure
If I kill the starting 5 that'll weaken they bench up
Seek time in another frame
And I'm thirsty for knowledge
What it really mean my mind got a hunger pain
Could I shine when it come to rain?
And could it rain when I shine
Once in a while to keep me on a humble plane?

It is the key to all the doors
It is the key to all the doors

Honor and respect
Llama in the bama check, the drama in a sec'
Think 'bout the days when we blew chocolate
Gin and tonic 'til the death
And niggas grew up fast and threw up cash
To get sneakers, cars and clothes, and who want blast?
And this is our life, we live this, nigga
Sound trife, but we did this, nigga

Just to breath out here is a motherfucking privilege, nigga

It is the key to all the doors

Maintain and persevere through the hard times
But is it hard if I ain't doing hard time?
Work your ear, hard rhymes through the God mind
Best on the street and I only do it part time
Flow is just the tip of the iceberg
Low when I'm spitting them nice words
Get dough when I'm hitting them right curbs
Live off of principle, nigga
Complex, but I try to keep it simple, my nigga
I got to work on my physical and mental, my nigga
Nowadays they bust shots at your temple, my nigga
I said the streets don't love you back
So I sleep with a eye open, hug my gat
I'ma ride for my man, I'm a thug like that
It's family first
It's going down I'ma blam you first
Step back, you see the man at work, you know

Though its all the same shit
(I'm Black)
Even though my skin's kind of light
That means my ancestors was raped by somebody white
(I'm Black)
So I like to sing dance and crack jokes
Eat good food and be around black folks
(I'm Black)
Sort of like the Holys on Sundays
Drink all night and still go to work monday
(I'm Black)
So I like the kids looking real nice
Cuz I've been poor and I know what it feels like
(I'm Black)
And I'mma say it loud like James Brown
People be proud cuz we all up in the game now
(I'm Black)
And I'mma hold my right fist real high
Might see my man and we might get real high

And I know it, and I ain't afraid to show it

And I'm a genius and a motherfuckin poet
You know it

Don't you be scared of me Mister
Cuz you don't really seem to be scared of my sister
(I'm Black)
And I can ride first class too
Or buy an exotic car and like murk past you
(I'm Black)
And I don't need a tan in the winter
Mind strong and powerful not a I cypher can't enter
(I'm Black)
And I don't need jewelry to shine
Look in my skin color is like the jewelry is blind

They focus on the negative attention
Do something positive, and never get mentioned

Listen it's a fact, original man
I wouldn't change it if I could and thats that

Look in my eyes the wool can't get pulled over
Look in my cars and stay gettin pulled over

Me the public enemies number one
Government looking in the hood sending in the gun

I grew up off the good time show
Drink liquor smoke weed and let the good times roll

I live for my wife and my seeds
And my mom with a bond only God can acceed

I got to show my homeboys love
First thing you learnt in the hood is homeboy love

Shadows,The Green Ghost Project,2010.0,"I mean... Sometimes I see things, I guess cause I'm a ghost I see ghostly things
Thought I saw something that wasn't there, but it was there...

They're as far as the eye can see
(as far as I can see though)
There are shadows haunting me
(I see shadows)
They're as far as the eye can see
(and I'm looking real far, even if I'm asleep)
There are shadows haunting me
(ain't that something?)

Something in the shadows
Maybe it's the Pharaohs
Coming to spread the light, cause the vision's so narrow
Maybe it's the killa's in the cut, with the barrels
Getting high, but can't fly without the eye of a sparrow
Fatigued and fatigue ready for battle
My word could move herd like the cattle
Try to stay hard, life's fragile, meaning you could lose any moment
My cranium is like Damien's, no Omen
I don't bare the mark of the beast
Just the heart of the beast
Rally for 'em when it's dark in the streets
Just a ice cold nigga that be sparking the heat
Tryna make it through the struggle just to say ""at the least,""
If they coming, tell 'em come now
Sunset, sundown
I don't put my gun down
And I ain't tryna run, clown
I keep something in the barrels
Fully loaded up knowing there's something in the shadows

They're as far as the eye can see
(Point blank period, get high and hallucinate)
There are shadows haunting me
(Stress is building up)
They're as far as the eye can see
(I smell murder every time that the wind blows)
There are shadows haunting me
(I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling)

Something in the shadows, maybe its the reaper
Maybe its the devil trying to put me in the sleeper
Maybe its God trying to tell me that I'm deeper
I'll know soon, have faith in a goon
I broke date, mad years trying to race with the moon
If the sun give me energy
Why I pull my gun, on my enemies
And wait for nightfall to drink Hennessy
Cups of Courvoisier, time's the same on this Swatch
Or Cartier, unless you set your watch different
We got eyes, but our watch different
Be on the block different
Be on the low in the spot different
I got bars, but the Glock kicking
I'm in tune with the moon
And the wolves that howl at it
You could play the game if you foul at it
Tell the pigs it's a fair game
I get high, and kick my Nike Airs off in first class on the airplane


I won't rest til the day I see the angel of death
And tell him ""wish me the best,""
If I dont get it this life, may I get it the next
Never settle for less
Street nigga's say I did it the best, which is true though
Coke since the days of Menudo
Higher than Pluto
Something in the shadows, but I ain't got a clue though, (I got no clue)
I'm getting drunk off the booze
I'm getting high, just recording with 'Poose
Have dreams about the Lord and his crew
Or the devil and his boys
I have voices in my head, but I can never make the noise stop, (can't stop, can it)
They always singing on a carol
Far as they can see, know there's something in the shadows",https://genius.com/Styles-p-shadows-lyrics
I’m a G,Master Of Ceremonies,2011,"Most of us came from a broken home
Drownin' in my sorrow, drinkin' liquor, tryin' to smoke alone
Argue with my wife so I broke my phone
Threw it on the wall, tryin' to ball, but they playing zone
Connect is acting funny with the work
Like my money didn't work, they gon' end up getting merked
The label acting funny with the deal
Like the shit that I be spittin' on the record wasn't real
Hood mad but they know a nigga ride
But the anger and jealousy can blow a nigga high
The other day I said I know a nigga fucked
When I played the bodega, it was two dollars for the Dutch
To keep it real, we living in real time
And I feel a nigga's pain but they never can feel mine
And so I'm on the go with the green light
I don't even sleep, how the fuck could I dream right?

Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'mma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G

Ghost, never on that swag shit
Guess it's a sad thing my tarot card is magic
I remember I ain't never have shit
December was cold but, February was drastic!
So pardon my niggas and what they traffic
Or if they seem cold when the murder scene's tragic
Niggas can talk shit, we don't even glimpse
Niggas can get hit, we don't even wince
Come with an entourage and I don't mean Vince
Purple ape in a purple Porsche, of course I'm playing Prince
Or looking through the sky light, my light
And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights
Blowin' on a long Dutch, inhale
How I lie I'd rather die than be in jail
It's all good 'til it's all bad
And the ugly niggas gon' crash your broad's pad

Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'mma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G

I keep it moving in my new J.O.'s
On them blocks, where them young boys move llello
They salute like ""Whattup O.G.?"" I salute
Cause it's the Wild Wild West like Kool Moe Dee
What they do for a two-door B, and a nice watch
Blow your brains out when the cocaine price drop
Like yeah I know my man got life ock
The game don't stop so pull the weed out your nike sock
Yeah! It's like that ain't it?
My down South niggas that got the Lex painted
My East coast niggas that got the Benz kitted
Don't it hurt when they snitch and you found out your friends did it?
I thought it's money over bitches but
Niggas throw money at bitches so let's kick it
If you really live by the G code
Shoot a couple of guns, hurry up and reload

Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; they keep telling me things getting better
Yayyyy-yeahhh-yeahh; but I'mma do me, you can say whatever
I'm a G",https://genius.com/Styles-p-im-a-g-lyrics
Holiday,Ghost in the Shell,2010.0,"Knee-deep in the game
Due time you'll see the sunshine if you sleep in the rain
I ain't tryin to weather the storm
I get over the clouds and I ain't talkin 'bout flyin a plane
I'm in the slums where the guns is
Niggas sell crack to get hundreds - I mean thousands
I seen European cars by housing
I seen shinin on your block, I'm just browsin
Fo'-five make you get free
My London niggas say, ""You get me?"" I say, ""I got you""
Rude boy, they better watch you
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
When I was young they used to say I had a older soul
Only death can make the soldiers fold
Comin down, hit the floor, let go, all my soldiers roll
You get hit then your soul let go, let's go

(Let's go) We pop shots off at your bean
D-Block, Byrd Gang, that's the team (team team)
Big fifth make you move back
Go against them, you don't really wanna do that
Them got that yay.. it's a holiday (holiday baby)
If you fuck with my money then you might as well pay

Handgun and the rifle
And a knife too, shit just that trifle
Get blood from your ice to your Nike boots
Head cracked like the dice do
I don't squeal nor squeak like the mice do
I get hype too, come through the block and light you
Like a cigarette, you ain't seen a harder nigga yet
Hit you like a Nicorette
Off a lion nigga pick a pet, I mean pick a beast
I run the city nigga pick a street
Matter fact you could pick a beef
I'm old school we can shoot it out, pick a heat
Fuck you!


I get ya, get the picture?
I'm the painter, you the painted
Talkin shit when you ain't shit
I'm five-star, you ain't ranked kid
I'm major, fuck the majors, fuck the label
And take that to the bank kid
It's the Ghost or the Phantom
Killin rappers at random without a handgun, can't stand him
I'm too nice, I'm too hot
You don't wanna drop from the top of the rooftop
Turn the mic up, turn the beat up

Real shit...Styles P Shit..
If P want you dead, I ain't comin' wit niggas
Just a blunt and a tre pound, plenty of liquor
So ya homies got something to pour
That's that old school shit
I ain't tryin' to put you under the floor
I'm tryin' ta bang niggas over the clouds
And I heard you say you rich
So you can't get lower than Styles
Kill everybody dead just so noone can smile
Play the streets my whole life and I been flowin' a while
Biget I rock, ever since my nigga was shot and my other nigga
Will shoot shit I'm tellin' the truth
If I lie, may I die in the middle of the verse
My niggas hustle from first to first
Twelve months in a year
Gun on your waist, Blunt in your ear
Pack in your sock, crate at the back of the block
With a fiend watchin' for NARCS till the shit get dark
We hop in the hoop ride, instead of the six
While you lookin' for a bitch, we lookin' for a brick
That we can cook by six and give the whole block a fix
Catch me OT gettin' sixty a shift
Holidy Styles, nigga I ain't nothin' but streets
Just as hard as the shit, that be under your feet
And the only time I front is with a blunt in the beak
To show niggas that I'm nice and they ain't fuckin' wit me

All I know is drugs and guns
And plenty of weed
And that bitch that suck dick
And niggas that bleed
And if you're rich before you go
Get a watch and a drop
You better hit the court house
And better bail out the block
If your son ain't worth shit
Niggas'll smuggle your daughter
I come through in a Porshe
The same color as water
I got weight, what you want
I can cover the order
They call me Boss when I cross the border
Six shot ""caught her?""
I hear niggas say my face is screwed
But I'll put six in your stomach nigga
Lace your food
Scream ""Fuck Every Rapper"" that hate that I'm rude
But that's that SP shit, you can take it or move
We can let the bullets spill, till we all get killed
There's only six nice rappers
If you wanna be real
Niggas die everyday from talking that dumb shit
That where they're from shit
All that mean to me is you can get your gun quick
Just another dumb bitch
Go to church to get the holy ghost
I did my dirt and got the holy ghost
Look at the world through a niggas eyes
Dont be a bitch, you gonna live and die
Ribbon in the sky, but no love when you slither by
I pray to god that we make it to heaven
But the only thing we makin' is channel eleven
You know four, five and seven,
 hot as fuck
And every rapper be dead, if they were hotter than us

All I Know is Pain,Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman),2007.0,"Pain...

All I know is pain, all I seen is death
Couple homies and brother gone, when I'm gon' step
I ain't suicidal, damn, my brain need rest
Think about my childhood, pain in my chest
Past is the past, future ain't great
All right in the hood, when any day could be my last
Pop something back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hawk some back, they wanna sue me for my math
Hard bein a gangsta rapper, you don't know the half
You ain't got to condone it but you was never homeless
And you ain't never fast, so you don't know the wrath
To taking a long walk, down the wrong path
All I know is pain, everything I did wrong
I did it in vain, that's why I'm tryna change
Live for my seeds but the game ain't change
Only the strong survive, I will maintain

All I know is pain, all I get is pain
All I give is pain, all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's no love, ice cold blood running all through my veins)
All I know is pain, all I get is pain
All I give is pain, all I live is pain
Only thing I know is mad years in the game
(It's more than rhymes, more shine than the diamonds on your chain)

What you know about pain?
Blood, sweat and tears where I'm standing in the rain
If I don't blow Mary Jane, I'm going insane
Before I had a car, I was in the fast lane
Drugdealing stick up kid for the neck game, a lot that I regret
But I made it as a rapper, and it's not what I expect
For a fact, this business is more crooked
The boys'll sell they souls to the devil, the Lord looking
See in you hell just in case that we all cooking
I got sins too, lot of foul shit that I been through
The world is God house, I'm just a window pane
Tryna maintain up to the end, yo


All I know is pain, I feel so drained
Rap niggas is insane, they on Procaine
What they call hot, I would call so lame
They don't care about the art, and they show no shame
If you ain't getting spins, then you ain't gon' win
But if you came from the bottom, you should stay going in
The Ghost don't make it then the Phantom gon' win

Marie Antoinette,Dime Bag,2018.0,"Kill all of these rappers, homie, it's too ill
I am in the Matrix but never takin' the blue pill
From Son of Sam town
If they ain't got the ratchet, get a hatchet or gas the car to run a man down
Not a camera but a hammer so run when it pan 'round
'Cause you don't stand there when they gunnin' a man down
Unless you the clown that came to catch the spare round
If you pull it then you know how a bullet through air sound
Sicker than sickin' a dog on a sick man
Shoot it out with all of these rappers, not have shit planned
Put five in the startin' five, six in the sixth man
Whoever come off of the bench is gettin' drenched
Beat his face to a dent like I was Raid or Ip man
The Ghost back, this them old raps in a new me
But new me is older than the old me
Which would make the new me retarded
See your face and I blow heat, Ghost, nigga


Wanna meet up with the Reaper? I'll introduce you to him
Set me on a blind date once, I hit Medusa for 'em
Wise man can see that a peasant has a king in 'em
Dance wit' the devil but never for you to sing wit' 'em
Run wit' a demon but never for you to cling to 'em
See the angle, all of the angels ain't got wings to 'em
Me? I go black when they challenge my G
I blow my soul out the challenge tryna balance my chi
Channel my rage or it's Animal P
Yeah, he plant-based but he could lead this room on a cannibal steez
You ain't fuckin' with the Phantom, you see
If you don't, 'cause I knocked your eyes out for your family to see, yeah!


Wack rappers shouldn't be breathin', at least not a rhyme
Fuck about your set, my nigga, throw up a dollar sign
Five niggas, ten guns, right up in the Impala ride
Playin' Spotify, tryna spot a guy, then a shot'll fly
All twenty in them shits, yeah, it's homicide
You can get the picture, bitch, I ain't got to dramatize
I ain't take drama class, askin' where the scarma at
Hash in it, askin' shit like, ""where his baby momma at?""
My hood, it get terrible
And the wrong territory leads to a burial
Fucked up scenario
Back on that shit, loadin' up, yeah, here we go
Comin' through the strip, niggas skip, like, there they go
Air holes in everything we pack, we prepared to go war like it's overseas
Kill 'em if it's over cheese or principles

Got bad luck, like I ran and fucked the voodoo lady
Every other week I'm in handcuffs
Stack somethin, lose somethin, somethin keep fuckin my plans up
Movin in a hurry, thinkin time is slow
When I pass the cemetery where my lil' brother is buried
All I can do is salute, pound on my chest
God got his army and we all his recruits
But, every other night I see demons
Do somethin wild and I don't know the reasons
Blame it on the air, so I say it's the seasons
Tell my niggas light the fuck up cause I'm fiendin
Get it - it's somethin when the sadness turn into madness
Got me doin shit, where I'm runnin from badges
I can see my life in some flashes, they think that I'm clashes
I pour more 'gnac in the glass kid

It's all about we got da tools wid us
Fuckin CRAZY~! Things ain't gonna be cool wid us
Luxurious - bring the guns along dey always cruise wid us
Those fuckers know better, that's cause dem no fool wid us
Huh, fuckin dogs, we gon' put dem in some leeches
As far as it reaches, we gon' iron out dem creases
With the four pieces, DEM got 
to use
 around the neck
Cannon go squeezes, DEM a soldier CRAZY believe it

I go to sleep and my soul cry, nigga it's no lie
Why you think I'm so high, I flow like it's no time
Funny when your mind is a goldmine, and niggas is golddiggers
Guess you gon' learn when it's yo' time
Stressed up to my shoulders, fuck it I'mma ride now
Brim of the Yankee, sittin on my eyebrows
Look at the stash and think that I'm gassed
Off the Godfather saga cause Vito wouldn't lie down
Me and destiny got a date, wheover with me rollin
If you ain't then you go get your 8, cause I ain't gon' fold
I take 'em all on
I've been dyin for the day to get my war on
I reflect on the days when I played 
Rahway
 gettin my score on
And came back to the hood with my forearms
Go get more mans, I got floor plans
And 23 ways to blow you out of them Jor-dans

Try to beat me but don't worry I got dem
Make dem bleed blood it's a pleasure to squash dem
They ain't allathat so, I saw dem
Escapin from de cops dem ain't see me tryin to stop dem
Say you're livin BIG~! On top of de world
You go against me you gon' get freed on dis side of de world yah
They say you're mad I say things comes and go
But I never leave mi gun because I wan kill dem fuckin punks

Some niggas say I'm the sickest
If I got a show ghetto niggas go get the ticket
If I ain't blow on the stage, I had me a gauge
Outside on some bullshit, ready to stick it
Like the hood made me wicked as hell
Thought about more bullshit sittin in jail, listen up
It's nothin more important than feedin your seeds
I got two, so I just start believin in greed
It's like I'm needin the weed and needin to read
Got to go against the odds just to even achieve
It's like I'm tired of the hassle and all that
You the king I run up in your castle and all that
I'm nicer than whoever you can name, been through the dark side
Walked back through the flames and came with a lightning push
Shined on the game, and e'rybody die
At the drop of a dime if they rhyme on my name

Sit bak relax heah we kickin for a while
Sizzla Kalonji and Styles, yeah beautiful girls dey smile
Bless your feet on de Jamaican side, dat's de profile
Why de fuck de fuckin enemies wanna spoil, yeah
True born leaders woo yeah we navigate
Yah life is a cycle, so things got to gravitate
Smoke de fuckin herb, that's how I meditate

So warriors is what I brought

A cold heart and a hot slug is not love
Them boys'll pop up, leave you chopped up

Got cuffed, why you think I'm frontin' in a drop truck?
Grindin', I work real hard, wasn't pot luck

Swim with the sharks, you a killa or you live bait?
Considered a titan although I'm only five-eight
Born in the jungle, made it out, I survived hate
Run with gorillas, bang my chest like I'm a primate
Consider me a land pirate that knows the pie rate
Get lined without a ruler, a nine at your medulla for a lil' bit of moolah
Found his body chopped up in Mexico in the cooler
Right next to a shooter and his best friend
It ain't chess but they put him in, check then
If you know the math on the wrath, he is less than
From the south side, but I hustle on the west end
Pain and that stress gon' kill you if it's kept in

That go to work because parole, but they tryin to be good niggas

For all the poor mothers...
Thats always goin through the struggle, still screamin' that the Lord ""Love us""

For the ghetto life...
For having to hold your metal tight lookin for a better life

For the family...
For if I'm rich you rich and that shit's a guarantee

For the best of life...
For if I ride you ride the motherfucking rest of life

We thugs, my niggas
Ride to the death with my man cause I motherfucking love my niggas
We ghetto, my niggas
Any time, any place, we don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas
We gangsta my niggas
You oughta keep your mouth shut
Watch what you sayin cause we shank you, my niggas
We D-Block niggas, we don't play games
We just hit you in your frame cause we pop niggas

Aiyyo, yo, I'mma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual

That's how you keep the love unconditional

That's why we the only one the thugs listen to

Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do

I know a few dudes doin life bids in jail

And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale

But that how life is

And that how the gun and the knife is

It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya

When ya come through and fishtail in Hennesey Viper

Listen, it ain't the rappers it's the rats that worry me

Double R for life, D-Block til they bury me

Scared niggas shed off
Or stand way in the back and aim they gat up in the air and...

Let off

Thorough niggas tear nigga head off, then let the blood keep drippin...

And just wipe the sweat off


Fuck with P, the thug'll come out

The slug'll come out

You don't put in enough work, I got chu

No doubt

They don't want Sheek to wild

Betta cover ya child

With two guns out the sun-roof...

Swordfish style

Who that kid?
Black mask on with the latch on, the AK
Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag

You get it in a hurry

All up in your Burberry

Through your assisstant

Through your fucking secretary

All y'all do me a favor...

Walk with me

If you want money or drugs...

Talk with me

Know I got my niggas my guns

Now hawk with me

Guess who? Jada, P, and The Sheek

Three bricks

Three whips

Three motherfucking ouies a week

Ten spots OT

Two blew off leak

My niggas cop...

Pop and toss, and we applying the pressure

So when you address us...

It's Boss...

Boss...

Never Safe,Phantom and the Ghost,2014.0,"Looking in the mirror, just telling myself to pray more
God ain't taking cash for them sins you got to pay for
Ghost here, but you don't need to the ouija to work
I blow the blunt, travel the smoke, leaving the earth
And I'm on an ill journey, you pussy then pull your panties up
Spit on Satan's face, tell the antichrist to ante up
Serpents in my sleep, bullets fully awake
I guess the angels got my back, or it could've been faith
Cuz my soul travel the earth, out in the space
Think of my niggas on the highway, out of the state
Touching weight, but a gym ain't around
If you're the king of the deadman, rarely do we give them a crown
Shit, I'm just trynna talk sense to ya
Said he's your homie, but I bet he won't pay the rent for ya
But he's chillin and gettin bent with ya
Sittin in the whip, just thinking of what I said to ya
Will he feed your seed if you need him to?
We all follow the path that greed lead us to
If you bleed for me, I'ma bleed for you
And be right there when you need me to
Other than that, let's go our separate ways
Cuz I'm in the jungle where the lions and all the leopards stay
Niggas let it spray like pepper spray
But everybody prays for a better day

I meditate to elevate, then I medicate to levitate
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe (x2)

Street niggas is lookin for a better contact
Rap niggas done signed up the devil's contract
Niggas'll leave their brother behind just to shine
Back then, you told him you'd give him your last dime
You and him would kick it, that's just a pastime
Now it's past times when you both would blast nines
All the money went where the hoes was
Your mind ain't designer like the clothes was
You a low down nigga, no love
No tears, no sweat, no blood
Hammer on my waist, outside where it's never safe
Pound of the kush in the telly, trynna levitate
You a bitch nigga, don't make me demonstrate
I'm heavy where you're featherweight, every bullet'll penetrate
But fuck that, I'ma meditate
Blowin on this OG medicate

I meditate to elevate, then I medicate to levitate

Wha, wha yeah
It's like a team over here daddy
One for all, and one for one 
If it ain't that then it ain't right
If you be knowin that, you'll be aight

My heart goes out to the homeless and poor
And my niggas in the bing that didn't go to the board
Wit a 25 to L on your back the shit is too cold
And for the kids that didn't get they school clothes
For the gods that lost they earth
The world's a song you'll get it back you just lost your verse
It's P verse the demons, that's why I'm feenin for weed
Cuz I don't wanna forfeit first
I could even bust my gun and do some office work
But I still wanna off this jerk 
I can't leave it out my rhymes 
Cuz it be part of my dreams, to see 20 porsches murk
Three houses for the family, two for the niggas
When I die I was true to the niggas 
And I never practice voodoo
But it's like Black Magic how I spit this fluid to niggas

How do you move on his way
When taking all this stress and pain
There's gotta be a better way
There's gotta be a better way yeah
If I should give up hope today
P won't you help me find my way
All I really want...
Is to live my life so we can just get high yeah, yeah

Ask God when he stoppin the pain
A fiend got a shoelace on his arm and he poppin his vein
And the needle look dirty but I'm close to reaching thirty
And the only thing I know it's a profit to gain
I might cry but I'm still cold
I might be cold but I still cry
And bottomline I'mma still die
I can see the doors openin now
I can see the ghost floatin around
That's why P come down with the potenest sound
Spit the shit that'll open the ground 
My third eye got a horoscope 
So if you wanna know my horoscope, listen to the bars I wrote
Build and destroy
Come through the strip wit, bricks of the girl and keys of the boy
Cuz all I really want 
Was a gun and blunt, a lil money and some keys to a toy


My whole life been a sacrifice
So if my nigga need my help he ain't never gotta ask me twice
I'm the nigga you could kick it wit
You gotta spot you wanna rob I'm the nigga you could stick it wit
I'm in the studio, I'm droppin pain on the beat
I'm famous indeed, but those is two differences
They tryin to understand me, but I overstand 'em
I'm the flowin phanthom, til we blowin random
To my corner niggas holdin cannons
That want the money and jewels and everything cuz we so demanding
To the hoes that think I'm handsome
That know a gangster when she see one ma, yeah money that's the anthem
Callin niggas like that's the ransom
You could take 'em you could leave 'em but your man ain't a happy camper
If P flowin then that's the cancer

Never Fight An African,Dime Bag,2018.0,"Shout to all the real niggas

Die for the cause, yeah, I will (I will)
I used to do crime for the thrills and all for the bills
With a white man face from a black slum
Like I'm gon’ need a white man place
I'm a brown king, why I need the white man grace?
I just need to pray so I can get the right man's grace
That’s the God up above
My people mud colored but dirt from the earth
So I know that we made of love
Soak up the sun like a sponge (Soak it up)
Dance for the rain, we are one (We dancin')
We all of the elements with all of the resonance
I like 'em dead if we speakin' on presidents
Not a Trump supporter, not a Clinton supporter
And Obama slipped too, we need to get it in order (Facts)
I let the truth and the facts out
Let's turn the White House to a glass house
But fuck politics, pull the hash out
And the peace pipe
I came from the streetlights to the limelight, tryna eat right
And if one brother starves, we ain't eat right



Treat man kind 'cause I'm part of mankind
Never talkin’ dirt, burner or landline
Cross me, that’s like steppin' on a landmine
I am outside with my folks tryna man mine
I ain’t no house nigga, I been in the fields
Where I'm from niggas run when they see a shield
Everybody know the deal
If you get knocked by the cops when you locked, you don't get no appeal
Time to level-up and fuck the Devil up
I'm at peace with my brother, I’m puttin' the metal up
If you owe me, then show, it's time to settle up
Forty acres and a mule in a Porsche, just set it up



Let me give you a little insight
You are still black if your skin's light
You are still black if your skin's white
But forget about skin types, focus on the facts
History'll make the whole world black

Only thing he left was his name for his children
Shit hurt me bad, said the shame almost killed him
Dog you ain't to blame, know the game did us reeled in
Used to have dames that got brains at the Hilton
Even had the Range and the chain that he chilled in
Now he just survive off the beast that was built-in
I stay strong for him, later on the side for him
Cause he a hard nigga, but shit hard for him
I pray to God for him, and me too
A lot of niggas see through
I ain't tryn'a hear shit but I need to
I'm thugged out but I mutha'fuckin read too
I'm conscious but I like to blow weed too
So I'm complex
I'm on the armrest life ain't right yet
I stay strong from my fitted to my Nike checks, nigga

Keep the mask, like Halloween, on dog
Olive green Maserati four-door
My ghost asked what I'm poor for?
Hit the safe and take more raw
That was my into
Give it up again, heard it was simple
But years later took a toll on my mental
Shiiit
Now I move with animal instincts
Where I'm from you could tell if the shit stink
Nigga hustle hard, wear your clothes a week in a row and fuck what a bitch think
Catch me in something fast, with something stashed
Puffin on something fat I know don't nothing last
Ride now blow later on 'em
Lettin out with Luis shoes, little bit of gator on 'em
Pop a bottle if you made it on 'em
Tell them niggas you can't lose and don't move cause the eight is on 'em
And tell my niggas in jail I'll be waiting on 'em

Blow till I'm too high
Roll when the crew ride
Benz and the Bimmer nigga, still in the hoop ride
Raised in a place you was taught how to shoot five
Buck ninety something nigga, I could make the coupe fly
Hood till the day I die
Good with the way I ride
Two guns one knife,shit I'm tryn'a stay alive
Twenty on the yack bottle, blowin' on a fifty piece
Rap don't work, mutha'fucker I'ma hit the streets
Bar codes on the Dutch, now I gotta hit the leak
Been up two years straight, dog I don't get to sleep
I ain't complain when it was caine money
Why complain when it's the game money?
If it's out one hand, in the next hand, you ask me, it's the same money
Learn the game if you playin it
Game if you J'in it

When you on lit, you gon' double up (Double up)
Heard them haters prayin' that we fall, nigga (Fall, nigga)
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em (Go to war with 'em)

Stay on your shit and you gon' bubble up
We was all poor but we squad so we huddled up
If it ain't a bullet or the law it don't trouble us
High doin' dirt but I'm hopin' the Lord cover us
Uptown doin' it, downtown doin' it, out of state pursuin' it
A cop or a shot from a Glock might ruin it
All I think about is who I drink this King Louis with
My nigga's my main squeeze from the jungle
But it seems that money contain G's
Told the plug make the call whenever the plane leaves
Feel joy from the money whenever the pain leaves
But the pain never goes
Money's the root of evil, am I sane for the flow? Insane for the flow
But this the fast life and the lane never slows
Mary Jane for the dome

Tuna in a can to that lobster, buttered up
Now I eat plants and I plan to plant some
Plannin' to stamp somethin' and niggas can't fuck it up
'Cause we ain't golden until we all shine
Can my Ghost live longer than one lifetime?
Four left turns, I'm in my right mind
Flyin' to Tiffany's from kickin' epiphanies
While I was hittin' trees and thinkin' of victories
Turned a nick to a dime and bought me a nick of weed
Made me a little rhyme, planted a little seed
Tomorrow's ghost night, today is ghost eve
So I told my ghost, ""Go, flow, proceed""

Heard them niggas prayin' that we fall, nigga
Extra clips when we go to war with 'em
Rather peace, I don't wanna go to war with 'em
If I had to swear to God, I'd give it all to 'em
Know the feelin', my nigga, I've been poor with 'em

Beluga 2.0s in the coupe I drove
On the stoop in the cold movin' stupid O's
Whip the fish before it even dried, deuce was sold
Take a half, produce a whole when I use the stove
Went from trappin' in Pelle jackets to rockin' Gucci clothes
That's why when you see me I'm with a group of hoes
Bad bitches that look like Karrueche, I'm used to those
Bal Harbor shoppin', my pockets do be swole
Cuban's gold
Put my knife in your body, remove your soul
Use your homie shirt to wipe my knife off
His blood splattered on my Kith Moncler, I stabbed him twice more
The fuck I'm takin' your advice for?
When they cut mama lights off, I started sellin' white soft
It's ironic the nigga they tried to write off was takin' the league by storm, I'm kinda like Moss
Wake up in the mornin' to a blunted sour
Then I'm up in lust, I'm makin' money shower
You got money and respect, then you got fuckin' power
I'm rich but I clap a nigga over a hundred dollars

Where I'm from, you keep the hammer tucked
Niggas is foul, fuck around and get your nana bucked
Grimy niggas'll stick Santa up
Kill Rudolph, then eat 'em, you couldn't manage us
Why you think niggas is comatose?
Homie gave the other homie mama bag, now he got mad
Gotta kill 'em with the mag 'cause she overdosed
If I gotta box, it's the 52 or the rope-a-dope
Stuntin' in the drop
Plottin' on the lot I could build on
Cross me I'ma rock a nigga knot
I ain't thinkin' like your average nigga
I got carats off of carrots sellin' juice
Peaceful yet a savage nigga
You could lie about them Cartel ties
Well I'm the type of guy to leave the Cartel tied
Get the match and the gas, watch the Cartel die
I'll catch 'em slippin' in the gym and let a barbell fly
Break his face with a plate like the ghost did Charlie Murphy
But I'm the real ghost, you ain't no Charlie Murphy
Not in the comedic way
I'm the one who make Paul and Peter pay
9 millimeter spray

What you know about the trap bein' slow 'cause the grams bad?
But the plug want his dough so you pay for your man half (I'll take care of that)
.44 Bulldog makin' your pants sag
I swim the swamp with a gator, I made it a handbag
They tell me I'm how hope look
Them pots had to slow cook
Stack of paper on my kitchen table look like notebooks
Two shooters with you? We know them niggas, they both puss
Roll through and I let this toast cook like Rosewood
Black Soprano family, I probably should make the movie
Pray over a brick while I'm slidin' a razor through 'em
Back to back trips now I got my bitch draped in Lou
I'm known for rock and a guitar like David Bowie
Yeah, I went against the FBI and crooked judges
When rappers start losin' limbs you know the Butcher comin'
Y'all still gassed off my rookie numbers
This the kid that's from a block that did Westside Gunn hoodie numbers
Uh, I grew to be a hustler but I ran with thieves (But I ran with thieves)
You steal from the gang, I bet your hands'll bleed
I met in a plug in the feds who used to hand me ki's
We was like Donovan McNabb and Andy Reid
Take me to your trap, I really autograph the plate
I fuck around and put my signature on a bag of H

""And I must, get it back""
Trust me, nothing prepares us
They never say gettin money slows your prayers up
We already in Hell! Nothin can scare us
We already fly high nothin can air us
Came from the underground so I stay grounded, astounded
By all the bullshit that I founded
A wise man can lose you soon as he gain jewels
Life get real and you think the pain's cool
You different, you makin a change, you let your man tell it
Blowin chronic, am I demonic or angelic?
No vanilla Dutch, fuck it, get a panetela
Roll a one sheet, think about my rap sheet
Sellin crack will have you runnin like a track meet
Watchin your back on every other back street
I started so young, why you think I'm so numb
You can't feel shit and only like real shit

The moon stay quiet but the sun spoke
Still can't blow away the pain with the blunt smoke
Tryin to give my daughter and my son hope
The shit get rough, when you breathin in the gun smoke
Do it all for a pile of the cash, funny
But I really only smile when I laugh (that's all)
You can say the pain run deep and I wonder
Do the insane or the sane ones speak?
And I feel like the devil got chains on me
I'm inside but I still feel the rain on me
(It's raining) like it's comin through the window or the windshield
Life full of sins'll have you spinnin like a windmill
Contract with God is signed and it been sealed
See you at the crossroads if everything has been real
I can feel what you can't
And the shit is vice versa so feel what you can't

I told you it is what it is
Can't choose how to die but I can choose how to live (true)
Thought about it just sittin where I live
Just another ghetto nigga with a million dollar crib
No hope, then I dropped the E and got hoppin
Got hip, just so I could get a little guap' (you get it?)
Before that, I used to move rock
With a 4 to 10 job after school workin stock (word)
Then I said ""Fuck pickin up a box""
So I sold more drugs, started stickin mo' spots
That's why I thank God for this rap shit

Short nigga, but make room though
I don't give a fuck if you came with a thousand goons, bro (Ghost)

I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though
I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though

You tryin' to be a nigga you was never not
Work that you never sold, guns that you never shot
Money that you never made, never handed out a fade
School of hard knocks, wasn't there, never got a grade
I was doin' dirt when Special Ed made ""I Got It Made""
Somebody gettin' cut, face or gut, if I got a blade
Call my gun can, let it spray like I got a Glade
That was back then, not now, not nowadays
I used to have hammers everywhere
Smartened up 'cause they have cameras everywhere
Heard you on the grizz', niggas lyin', you was a teddy bear
Wolves come out when it snow, yeah, it's petty here
I take a quarter like the meter does
I'm doin' everything that a leader does
I'm doin' everything that a soldier does
You ain't play the jungle, you ain't know what a cobra was
Take a look at me, you ain't know what a nova was
Niggas wanna kill me, give a fuck, give a shoulder shrug
Show the holster, got the older snub
Wiz got the newer nine, thought these niggas knew the time (Ghost)

I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)
Came— Came from the mud, yeah
Doomsday is my day one, I ain't doomed, though
I— I illuminate like the moon glow (Hahahaha)

Ghost - lighters in the air!

I wanna roll somethin up so
I-I can just blow, my mind (lighters in the air!)
I wanna, blow my mind (hey, hey - lighters in the air!)
Blow my mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)
You should roll somethin up so
You can just um, blow, your mind (blow your mind!)
You should just blow your mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)
Blow your mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)

Mind blown and I'm tore down
Still blow an ounce and a half, even more now
Yeah, put your lighters in the air, light it up in here
Yeah, put it in the air, see if I'mma fuckin' care
You should find that I came to blow my mind out
Pass it and you drop it I'mma put you on time-out
Like Joe Frazier I'm smokin, mere bang out in the open
In the tub, but it feel like the ocean
I swear to God it be floatin
And I don't need a car to be coastin, you could say that I'm boastin
But this is S.P., and I know my time
When I hear showtime, I'mma blow my mind!


The black hippie, the sack wit me, the lighter too
I have dreams of Amsterdam every night or two (Amsterdam)
I feel good, the sky couldn't be a brighter blue
Sun lookin like a tangerine
You got green and it's mean, brother hit me like a tambourine
I need a minute to myself, second to myself
Pass the dutchie on the left, whoever's suckin on the L
I'mma need candy cause I know my breath is gon' smell
I don't get sleep but some good restin off a L
Mind blown, time fly, time gone
Missed my exit on the highway I ride on
Roll another one, get in my good time zone


I'm gone, the 'gnac and the wine gone
Eyes look stoned shit, but what, I'm grown
Over 21, come over to my zone
In less than two hours see a 50 box blown
Lovin the smell, feelin the texture
And we got a whole lot but we still gettin extra
Guess what's on the menu for breakfast
Roll with the Ghost if you wanna get messed up


I mean just get blown away
Y'know... do what you do
Bungie jump or somethin, speed in the car
Do whatever blows your mind away
I know what blows mine away

You should roll somethin up so you can just um, blow, your mind",https://genius.com/Styles-p-blow-ya-mind-lyrics
In It to Win It,Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman),2007.0,"Lot of people mad I ain't dead yet
S.P. comin through your speakers and headsets
Streets is in the buildin whenever the Ghost in it
I remember cereal boxes with roaches in it
I'm a double G, that's a gangster and gentleman
Humble was nights I been homeless, cold and tremblin
You don't wanna touch me, can't hold no grem-lin
Gargoyle like Chow Yun, Fat in ""Hard Boiled""
Better stay away cause I'm toxic, hoch spit
Right in your face and bang you out like the moshpit
Heard I put in the work, it wasn't no gossip
The man with the plan so you know that the plot thick
Clip on reserve for whoever deserve
I swear to God, that's my word that I'm off of the curve
So you should know I'm in it to win it
If it start with a 3 end with an 8 Im in it to spin it
I like European cars and I'm into the spinach
Fuck around, you won't even get to finish the minute
Cause, it could be over in two seconds with two weapons
Think I really care about whatever your crew reppin?

I'm in it to win it, you motherfuckers ain't pay no dues
I dare you walk a, day in my shoes
I'm in it to win it, I'm on a strip tryin to move these bricks
But the streets won't let me quit
I'm in it to win it, you best believe I'm on my grind
You feel my pain in every verse and line
I'm in it to win it, years end and I'm still goin hard bitch
Knowin that these rappers is garbage
I'm in it to win it

Uhh, yes I is the best I is
Go hard like that Bedstuy kid; nigga I'm in it to win it
Momma said be the best I is
I burn shit down, just like Left Eye did
Uhh, the game don't stop, the pain don't stop
Bullets rip through his skull like a Drano shot
Got a strip for me to eat on, P name the spot
I take aim at any nigga (who?) name or not
For my hand-to-hand niggas, five gram niggas
Blam-blam niggas, you know who it is - Bully bitch!
Gun ready for any nigga who want it
Slam me? I don't think so, I'm fo' hundred (ha ha)
Yeah, I'm sittin in my Phantom
Nah I'm lyin, I'm hustlin, tryin to get a Phantom
You don't really understand him
Five-star general, ten-hut; nigga get your face cut


I do the knowledge if the cypher work
But ask the homie that the knife insert, what life is worth
When his heart pumps slow and his blood that he burp
And it's all type of shit on his shirt
And his girl and his mom look hurt
And he thinkin 'bout his seed but he layin in the hospital, leavin the Earth
They say real men pray for they enemies
Forgive but don't forget so I don't slip when I'm drunk off Hennessy
Blame that all ridiculous
Hoody'd up, in the cut, inconspicuous
Nina gon' burn them boys just like syphillis
Cross me, I'mma show 'em all what trippin is
The difference is, I'm a real G don't wanna make no noise
Got a conscience, to really wanna take them boys
To a place they never been or go again
You could blame the wind cause look what it's blowin in
S.P. the Ghost, here we go again, know that I'm goin in
You ain't doin nothin but goin out
My gun's like a candle, who dare me to blow it out?
All these rappers garbage, who want me to throw 'em out?
What?

Hater Love,Float,2013.0,"The small talk is irrelevant, gonna kill an elephant
Niggas look fly and their bitches look elegant
Let the birds fly like a pelican from NY up to Maryland
Be more careful, them little niggas will ear you
Tattoo tears over here, if you dare to, yeah
Wax out the trippy, wax off the other shit
Max with the hippies, mac out the window
If niggas will act iffy, M's off the piffy
Shit is getting sticky like Jiffy
Hood gon' cry, if they hit me
I'm a real ass nigga, get with me
Cushion to grind and my look is designed
And my dope is raw like it got cooked in China
Always on some other shit, even the hating niggas is loving it

Even the hating niggas is loving it (Even the haters love it!)
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Bullshit too!)
Even the hating niggas is loving it (Word!)
Fuck all the ho ass niggas and fuck the government

Haters still loving it, but I don't give a fuck if they didn't
I'm black loving it, poppin' off of some other shit
Hand on the Tommy, couple of shooters behind me
They trying to take the black man out like Mitt Romney
Me and P, add Kiss too and it's 3D (L-O-X!)
IMAX movie, shine on our watchers is dookey
They love my style, alligator band on a Hublot
True Religions on, Louis kicks, all on a big toe (You see me?)
You don't think I've seen a million dollars? I did though
Christopher Wallace money, every night is a big show
Hit the gym, back looking fucking for Indo
Dundun, bitch been on my dick from the get-go

It's crack or gat for the dollars
Ride around town in a black Impala
Niggas can act wild or show a bitch a mile script
Same ass guns to send an actor to valor
Sort of like the car that gave me no hope
I'm real rugged yet smoother than the bean old soap
I mean body wash, upon the shore is where his body was
It wasn't me, I was smoking weed with his bodyguard
I'm not feeling you, probably made a plan on killing
You ain't rap, nigga I'm willing to, I'm a mile boss
All day, part of it for departing, I'm like John fold tape
Where P goes is liquid, connect seeds solid though
Any sign of the feds, motherfucking bombing those
Whole court on the streets before I do 24 years
Being broke is the only thing money fears

Daddy Get That Cash,A Gangster and a Gentleman,2002.0,"Styles P...
It's Lil' Mo, holla at me
Get that cash daddy

If it's you versus me - think about it
They gon yell my name when they announce the winner
And I ain't bout to sell much
I got my honeys on the plane but the birds flyin south for the winter
Go get ya self familiated
I'm so gangsta that, just know'n myself makes me affiliated
What chu think honey hold 'em hammers for?
So she can spend 10 cent at Jill Sander store?
We gon hit Rodeo Drive on Beverly Hills
Though I love her, so I'm spendin like 70 bills
Every week she bring the llello in, keep ya payroll big
Light a blunt, and just beg me to chill
Ain't a player but my life is real all of the time
So she went and copped a gun a little smaller than mine
That's a down ass chick, and she keep it real
So I'mma keep it real back all of the time

Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash (I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it)

Daddy go and get that cash
Go and get the black suit, grab the burner plus get that match
She said ""Tell my where you goin""
It's no doubt I'm comin in
Cause she could fit a little 9 or a 22 right inside her bra or Calvin Klein underwear
Mami you could stay home and bag up the work
I'm just goin out to play chrome or nag up a jerk
If I kiss her then her heart'll melt
Listen dogg, you don't understand the work, that she carry in the garder belt
No doubt I love her, I'mma tell you the truth
But dont' get it fucked up, and get bucked up
Only thing sweet about P is his tooth
And she could sleep with another dude
She gon tell me where the safe at, the coke at, how to rob his mother too
""Daddy go and get that cash""...
That's what my honey holla'd out every time I hit that ass


Since you helped daddy get that cash
You get the condo and the mink, and the ring and the gift wrapped Jag
And you still got the bomb head, I pay the phone and the rent
But keep it real Boo, you pay the Con-ed
If I get knocked, she in the VI room
With some money on my books, give weed to a nigga
Don't worry about shit, cause I be out soon
No doubt that's my booby-cat
She drop my bricks off right on Broadway, and she go and get a doobie wrap
Lookin at the god like we oughta elope
One pop for the pasta, one pot for the coke
Holiday Styles, dick one shot for the dough
And it's sorta like we Bonnie and Clyde
I load the ouie up, she gon roll the gouie up, then mami abide
And she said ""Daddy get that cash""
She know I would but had no idea that I would skip that fast",https://genius.com/Styles-p-daddy-get-that-cash-lyrics
My Own,Nickel Bag,2018.0,"Yeah, it is what it is
Tell 'em ain't no me
Feel me?
Vinny Idol, nigga

Streets know the aura, Tommy guns, fedoras
Watch for the creeps, the peeps on the corner
Mommy read Genesis, I cred the Torah
Supposed to be righteous but I love the horror
Was thrilled by crime
I can't believe I let a motherfuckin' dollar bill kill my mind
Dull my senses, steal my shine
It took a strong will from me to heal my mind
Still, I'm blind 'cause still I grind
This ain't Astrology but feel my sign
Ghost walk his path align, feel his rap align
'Cause I kick shit that make the pastor cry
Weed pacify or pass the time
Got the soul of a slave with a mastermind
Get real ill, make a statue cry
'Cause gettin' real deep, that's a knack of mine
But fuck accolades, blow a splif and get kicks off a  page
Homie, put the MAC away
You either live or you die slow
Might you burn O's and hide dough from 5-0
I'm John Doe in the Tahoe
Glow in the dark how a spark'll leave your mind blown
My time's up in your time zone, still on the flow but, my nigga, I'm a ride on
Ghost

I be on my own shit, all about that dough shit
Greedy mother fucker on that low shit
I be on my own shit, all about that dough shit
Grease a eighty-eight, that's that blow shit
I be on my own shit

This is all from the school of hard knocks
From Wyo to Far Rock, I'm the nigga they play on the hard blocks
What's the meaning of time when you lookin' at God clock?
Speakin' on the patterns in the sky
Niggas make rules up and break 'em, but I'm adamant with mine
Catalyst for crime, talk shit I'm shatterin' your spine
'Cause I ain't get a ladder for the climb
Nah, no ropes, no hikin' shit
Had to play Valhalla on some vikin' shit
But never snitch gone on the deal
Live niggas keep it real, go out on they shield
No longer doin' crime but I could pass a line
Take a couple points, hit a joint, that is by design
Tradition kept, surprised a lotta niggas ain't missin' yet
Just 'cause they ain't listen yet
I know they deaf but they ain't get the vision yet
Who am I to judge?
Only robe I wear is from the 'telly on the balcony
Blowin' on the bud
And I ain't got a ego, I could show a nigga love
I got a Desert Eagle that could show a nigga mud
Dick in the dirt, floor wet 'cause of the blood
To tell the truth, nigga, I rather give you a hug
And you just mad 'cause of the plug
I know what it is, not what it was

I be on my own shit, all about that dough shit
Greedy mother fucker on that low shit
I be on my own shit, all about that dough shit

Wonderin' if God cry, cause I know the Devil laugh
Came from the dark, so the light is the better half
A gift and a curse, yeah, the shit'll split your head in half
Came from the light source then hit the dark force
Now I need sight, what you think I'm tryna spark for?
Played the fast lane, what you think I'm tryna park for?
Me and  was like twelve on a rock tour
When bass hit, basic, I was in the Matrix
Just gettin' out of it, told my wife I'm proud of it
I say the illest rhymes, smoke the loudest shit
Besides that, I be in the hood where it's live at
Spit from the soul, I feel, would he survive that?
Some call me G-Host others call me S Dot

Why ask the question to somethin' you know the answer to?

You a nerd then the gangsters wanna lamp wit'chu
Then you become wild and the biz get scared to camp with you

Blowin' weed for the stimulation
My body's my temple, the crib need renovations
I'm the contractor
Can't be the boss of the mob without the don factor
Make your wife smile
Bring your mom laughter and your kids, too
Smoke and drink wit'chu niggas
Get a couple Europeans, couple minks wit'chu niggas
If we can't get it together, shit, we can never hang (never)
Can't trust you with the work, we can never slang (never)
Can't trust you by a cop, we can never bang (never)

Had to man up and kneel down
Tell God that it's real now
It's life after death but is it death after death (is it?)
'Cause I've been breathin' real hard, breath after breath
Is it step after step or do I run to it?
This a wicked game, tell me do I bring my son to it? (Noah, what up?)
I'm at the bar then bring my gun to it 'cause love is love
But if it's war then blood is blood

For my jail niggas, peanut butter in they oatmeal
Homie got a target on his face, how  feel?
See 'em on the other side, tell you how his Ghost feel
Shit don't smoke but I'm gettin' more smoke still
Talk about the wave, fuck around, get the boat keeled
High tide, I'm the fly guy on a float still
Can't forget the days when I haven't eaten, no frills
Prayers then I roll up
Throw the peace sign, I know God see me throw it up
I know I don't know enough (I know)
Learn more, burn more, that's what I got a turn for
Can't turn back time but I could turn on my mind and move forward

Try to get Grants but the plan was all wrong
Wait for the time but the sand is all gone
What's the regiment? Smoke weed, get the Benjamins
Hit the spot for cocaine measurin
Got a Desert Eagle, need a city eagle
Tryin to tell my niggas the whole city evil
And all I know is murderers and gritty people
But it is what it is
And do what it do, I ain't gettin money my nigga
I keep it movin cause it ain't good biz
Half a mill' to a mill', that make you hood rich
If you dope as a dime, I can get you a good brick

Then turn the volume down and on to the next
Got your girl on Patron then she's off to the X
Got the Lex from the Japanese triad connect
Iraq, Iran, guns on deck
In the hands of the shooters if the funds ain't correct
Yeah, now what you know about the street life?
You could lose your life any night you don't creep right
Hoodie up with the mask down
School of hard knocks, the Ghost never was the class clown

Now tell me what you know about the hood
You doin bad but you plannin to do good
You wanted platinum but they'll put you in the wood
You wanna ride and switch sides if you could
What's the schedule? Hit the streets stay credible
Everybody food seems edible
Got the trey pound, got the four pound
Ride around town playin 'Pac then it's Dogg Pound
Keep a big joint, or a long sword
I'm tryin to win and fuck the points on the scoreboard
Homey this the game of death
No Bruce Lee, I don't use the pen or the looseleaf

Never confuse peace

Shouldn't listen to the Ghost if you was never insane
Never the same once you learn to weather the pain
May you be never indicted, never arraigned
Can't appreciate the sun if it never would rain
Respected by the Crips and the Bloods with the old flags
Ridin' dirty, ratchet on her but no tags
Keep your foot on the gas or you gettin' a toe tag
Get a hole in your mask, you ain't able to draw fast
Ask God for a autograph knowin' he draw fast

I would battle the sun and the moon for more cash
I could humble myself if I'm on the Lord's path
I'ma schizo, maybe I'm a psycho
Disciple of the night and all that is trifle
Ex-dope boy, did all that, was trifle

Left the dope game for rap, shoulda took my lines
Get the city on my back, never took my spine
Off the stoop by seven, was a crook by nine
From the era where they screamed out, ""Do that shit!""
Do that shit, you had coke, you moved that shit
Police chase, got work, yeah, you threw that shit
Now it's different, got weed, homie, grew that shit
Sold a watch, who you 'bout to drink Blued Out with?
Play Suge, get lined on some 2Pac shit
Two joints together, Queensbridge, oowop shit
Home invasion, nigga, I shoot niggas, Guwop shit
You could die or chill, yeah, nigga, two options
I'm Lew Alcin or Bruce Lee
But it's the Game of Death if you ever choose P
I'm about peace but I need a few feet

I'm about peace but I'm with these hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the street

Loadin' up a hunnid shots, I ain't but a hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the street
Wolf is still wolf and I ain't cryin' wolf, my nigga, so you know that the wolf is gon' eat
Loadin' up a hunnid shots, I ain't but a hunnid shots buckin' at my enemies runnin' up the street
Lion's still a lion and I ain't even lyin', my nigga, so you know that a lion's gon' eat

Loadin' up a hunnid shots

All I Got,UnKnown,2013.0,"x2
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches

I got a couple of niggas that’ll drop yo body
Ridin in Ferraris and Maseratis
Suits in Dubai and Abu Dabi
Catch em at the juice bar guzzling baji
They can chef it up like Emeril Lagasse
A game when daddy can’t play them posse
Martini and Rossi, asti spumante
You doin the science, I’m a giant just like Andre
Talk about washin the money like it was laundry
Probably smoking a blunt, sippin upon a Don P
Now all these whack rappers is beyond me
And the fact they think they nice; that alarms me
But like alchemist I smoke calmly
The army couldn’t harm me
Kill yourself before you ever think to bomb me
Yea boss of the boss, nigga Don P

Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
-I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
-I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
-I get saluted by the people when I’m on my block
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
-I ain’t got it all but I’m good with all I got

I got some wild Albanians that come through the block
In some slippers and a jumpsuit and lift off yo top
All maple on the shifter,Armagnac up in the snifter
Catch me in the 5 with the Shiksa
Leather vest with the patches all embroided
I tuck Jackie with the soy milk
Mad ginger before I rap, 
bunch of joints like a bat rack
You warm pussy and it’s time to take a cat nap
Smoke the catnip, fiends rip the plastic
Hookers getting bread, no G waste band elastic
Talkin business in the bath house
Hilfiger hats rockin stack house
The crib look like Shaq house
Uh, sharp foot like i'm John Bones Jones, kid
Tomahawke chop, red bone in
Grab yo bitch, lay nuts on the ho chin
Only thing for me to do is go in

Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!
Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
I get saluted by the people when I’m on my block
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I ain’t got it all but I’m good with all I got

I got a couple of niggas that’ll smoke yo boots
Ridin on a train, know they flew in the hoop
Probably in the projects or most of the stoops
You can see em in the juice bar gulping the juice
Motherfuckers will shoot like they playin for doop
Deuces wild get the bricks, throw em off of the roof
Crack pack and yo sneakers are boots
With a gun on yo waist
Keep it movin when police in pursuit
I’m out here in the Jeep ball coupe
About that life
If you ain’t, I ain’t speakin to you
About that mic, SP a beast in the booth
Like I’m indian, I’m the fuckin chief in the booth
Know the difference between a sheep and a wolf
Trade deuce dues dues
You don’t wanna talk shit to a bull
Get yo higher than the first blunt, head in the pool
If your automatics are semi, get a full wuddup?

Yo I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
I got upmost respect everywhere I go
Yo I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
I got love from my fans when they hear my flow, yo!

"Blood, Sweat & Tears",PRESENCE,2019.0,"No longer wild, I watch the money pile
Funny ass niggas will act funny style
Funny how they want you slowed down when you running round
Be able to lift you up but they will gun you down
Plan is expand and travel throughout the land
Some scam, some blam, some niggas go hand in hand
Since the Dana Dane days is the times I was slinging haze
Got the picture but never the frame in the same day
Ain't a Blood but my man is, I bleed for him
Ain't a Crip but my man is, I C for him
Couple homies locked up I'm staying free for 'em
The youth need a old head I keep it G for 'em
I'm usually riding in the back seat
But if I drive i'ma play the lane to the max speed
Extraordinary gentleman, last league
Pardon self I mean last breed

For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years
For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years

I could shed a tear, I could shred a beer (I could)
I could dance on a track like I'm Fred Astaire (ha!)
Reflect on the past and look forward to better years (forward)
Settle my affairs with whoever, I bought the metal here
On a mission looking for God, you brought the devil here
I don't like your energy homie it shouldn't settle here
Hot and I boil like the water in the kettle yeah
And I set the standard for bars that you could never near (never)
Full of grief, put you to sleep, I'd rather chief
Know my style and you give me some weed, give me a leaf
I would two piece and stab up the devil 'cause he a thief (facts)
Stealing the joy, stealing the peace
But that's another time and another rhyme (another time)
Feds got your phone tapped, I wouldn't say another crime (shh)
And that's my word nigga (my word)
I keep it G but I'm honoring my nerd nigga... Ghost dog

For all the pain
For all the fears
Lost a lot of family and a lot of peers
Blood, sweat & tears for a lot of years

Ever lost part of your mind? That shit is painful (I have)
Used to sell dope to my folks, that shit is shameful
World is full of sinners so nobody could blame you
I am out enjoying the sun, that's what the rain do
I am out enjoying the rain, that's what the change do
I am ordained in the pains and the flames too (I'm ordained)
Don't you know that dog? (huh)
It's a Kodak moment when the feds come
And niggas take the low jack off (woo)
Love to see the bad guy get away (love it)
I'm a stoner so I never let the high get away
And my ghost got a ghost, it's a rival today (ghost)
And I found a new way, I've decided to pave

Leave a Message,Time is Money,2006.0,"{*answering machine beeps*}

Street life my niggas
Shit's a motherfucker you know?
I try to tell these shorties somethin
They look at me like, ""What the fuck?
Nigga you worse than me""
Nigga, don't listen to the messager
Listen to the message
A message to my son, it's times in my life
Where I stood around to fight when it was better off to run
A message to my daughter, daddy ain't make you
But sometimes in life blood ain't thicker than water
A message to my wife, I gotta say I love you
And thank you for makin shit better in my life
A message to my moms, don't worry about your kids
Cause love is always love when we in God's arms
A message to my pops, my head's on my shoulders
And I'm takin care of family and never will it stop
A message to my sister, your big brother got you
But never in life let a coward nigga twist you
A message to my niggas, when it comes to the hood
Who the fuck in the world could do it better than my niggas
A message to my group, we got it we made it
Cause nobody in the world sound better in the booth

{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message - I'm gone right now
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message - it's on right now
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message - I'm gone right now
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message

A message to the jail, I don't really write
Cause it's hard for me to say keep your head up through the mail
A message to the poor, stressin the life
What we don't get now we get in the second life
A message to the kids, stick to your school
Cause if you fuck with the streets that's jail or a bid
A message to the wild, you should calm down
Cause everybody rattin and you probably blow trial
A message to the ladies, depend on yourself
So if daddy walk out you take care of the baby
A message to the rich, you should spread love
'Fore niggas like me go ahead and spread clips
A message to the hood, shit is bad now
But we gon' be aight, cause it's soon to be good
A message to the world, I don't give a FUCK
P smoke 'til he he and he drink 'til he earl


Many ways they can send you a message, like a word from the wise
Or a 45 that send you to heaven
Some'll throw you a look, others a book
Like the king gettin killed by the rook, straight-forward
Some'll grab they soul when they feel like the Lord's callin
Some see it before it come
My nigga, one is all and all is one
I wanna see us all rich before all this done
But it's really God call cause we all his sons
So I'mma play my role, hope God save my soul
Let me slide for them sins I owe
Pain and more pain's the only change I know
Brain stay in the frame, I'm in the game I blow
Either my watch broke or my lame-ass slow
But I'mma count my blessings 'til I get to the essence
It's all good just send me a message, what?


A message to the jail
A message to the poor
A message to the kids
A message to the wild
A message to the ladies
A message to the rich... {*fades*}",https://genius.com/Styles-p-leave-a-message-lyrics
We Don’t Play,Master Of Ceremonies,2011.0,"Do the same thing, get the same results
Creeping like Batman, stronger than The Hulk
Running to the bank teller, dump it for the vault
On my town shit, Ben Affleck
Whole nigga cause most men just half-step
I ride hard motherfucka and I ain't crash yet
You don't know, or you do know
I'm like Mario Puzo with Cujo
You don't get it? I'm a prolific animal, every verse flammable
Weird like Murdoch, thinkin' like Hannibal
Man like Face but I'm wild like B.A
Bullets to your head when you talkin' to the D.A
Talking to the judge, and I be in the cab cause I think the car bugged
I don't play with hard luck
Killing your homeboy now you call it hard love
Treat you like a blunt how I'm getting you sparked up

Nigga we don't play! We handle problems the worst way
We'll get you shot stabbed robbed on your birthday
Nigga you ain't got no business 'round here in the first place
Look at everybody chilling - well fuck that!
I'ma play the villain - fuck that! I'm here to make a killin'
All money's good money, weed and liquor stealin'
Small money, tall money, nigga we want it all
Left hand on the wheel, other hand on the draw

Needle icepick through your writing hand
Heart like a rock, hard to drop like Spider-Man
Park your pretty cars up, hop inside the rider-van
Hunt ya like Worm for a couple hundred dollar fam
Drive of a street lord, knowledge of a college man
Almighty dollars get you dead, make your momma plan
Nothing like the sound of dough, I'ma make the commas dance
Numbers jump high, numb and drunk in my drama stance
The no fly zone, you don't get a city chance
Show up at your show, make you hoes piss your skinny pants
I'm with blammy so my haters can't stand me or jam me
I'm running niggas over like Brandy
Motherfuck a Grammy, give me weed and eye candy
Coca-Cola daughter, pussy from a very nice family
Won't last stepping in the street without the swammy
From Southside to Y.O., niggas die daily


I'm hard in the problem like algebra
Only use the gun if it's a high enough caliber
You ain't a Dodge car then you ain't no Challenger
Play wit'cha life nigga but you ain't no gambler
Die any day of the week, go get a calendar
Harder than Russian roulette, nigga fuck a Gillette
I take a gun and put a Buck to your neck
Or a 50 to your grill, bring the blicky to the hill
These young niggas is buggin', tipsy off the pills
I bring the fire like a motherfuckin' Bic lighter
Paper shredder eraser to any sick writer
Ghost is the Apocalypse, hole in your esophagus
Runnin through the shit like a motherfucking rhinoceros
Nasty like a hippo is, show you what a sicko is
Barrel to your girl clit, bitch is you ticklish?
You gon' fuck around and get, burned like syphilis nigga",https://genius.com/Styles-p-we-dont-play-lyrics

If there's beef in the hood
A nigga like P can't sleep 'til I'm good
Cause somebody dead
This 4/5 gotta hit somebody head
I'm all up in the safe takin' somebody bread

Shoot 'em in the head
Shoot 'em in the face or the chest
Then shoot 'em in the waist or the neck
Then shoot 'em in the gut or the mouth
Then shoot 'em in the back and don't stop 'til the blood runnin out

Guess I gotta burn down bridges, and break down rocks
And come through and let this tre pound pop
You all grown now
And I don't care if you from home town
I'll put a slug in the dome clown
Cause most of these rappers is talk
I'm the nigga in the back of the court
Wit 5 L's and a 1/2 of a quart
By 7 o' clock I'm stone cold drunk, wit a blunt and a 2yr old pump
Boulgin' out my pant leg
I'll put it out and make ya man beg
And shoot 'em anyway
Y'all niggas penny weight
Niggas like me just do what the semi say
Any way we can do it any where any day
I'm Paniero bitch, I ain't the nigga you play hero wit
End up dead, Ya t-shirt look white it's gon end up red
And my dogs look hungry they gon' end up fed BITCH!

I'm hope you lookin' forward to die
Hope you wanna look the lord in the eye
Hope you ready for this muthafuckin' shot to ya head
Or this sword in ya eye
You the shit I'm the +Lord of the Flies+
If you got beef say it now, bitch niggas
So I can load up and come toward you wit nines
I spray you and ya man
The coup and the van
The office and the studio where ever you stand
I don't wanna be the king of the coast
Feds watchin' me and you gotta stay low when you bring in the dope
Gotta look a lil' dirty when you swingin the toast
If you say the guy name, I'll be ringin ya throat
I don't rap about niggas
But I do like to cock back hit'em the chest
And blow the back up outta niggas

Came from New York but ya body was found in Michigan
After that im just fuckin ya lil sista and
Cookin bricks up in the kitchen and
Hit ya mom off with a little bit of grocery money
If you dont die over family, its supposed to be money
Natural causes is out of the question
When you breakin the law, every hour, every minute and second

Listen nigga you ain't got shit to bring
Less you wanna gargle on ya blood like its listerine
Felony niggas, have the lawyer break em down into misdermeanors
Used to run guns now a days im just shippin ninas
I could shoot you cocksuckers there ain't shit between us
Only say my name in a sense to a certain nigga
Big time hustlers, niggas just merkin niggas
Niggas think im under rated, im just under the radar

Fresh white tee, fresh car wash
Summertime hood niggas look like stars
Jewelry drip, fresh white Airs
Mami shake it up, keep your ass right there
(Ohhh can you believe it?)
My man got liquor and my cup's right here
I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here
Nigga pass that, Capri pants
With the waist cut off, I wanna smash that
(Ohhh can you believe it?)
Party and pack, minglin baby
Knockin LL shit, you jinglin', baby?
Back your ass up or I'ma start tinglin baby
We can have more fun than Ringaling baby
(Ohhh can you believe it?)
P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it
Nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it
Matter fact let your grub get it
Please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it

Can you believe it?
I take a little a break and get off the streets
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed
That's when it really dawned on me
That I'mma be here for life, ain't never gon' leave
The ghetto's all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga
Layin back trying get this dough
Yellin out ohhh-ohhhh
All up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like ohhh-ohhhh
Bad little bitches with they booty on swoll
I'm tryin to peep like ohhh-ohhhh
Know yo' ass feel it cause it's outta control
Let me hear you say ohhh-ohhhh
Let me hear you say ohhhhh-ohhhh; can you believe It?

Big-ass truck, brand new rims
Tanktop Yankee, tanned out Timbs
Bracelet, chain, fronts popped in
New tattoos, new black shoes
(Hey, can you believe it?)
Gucci, Urbes, we do that too
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black Coupe
Nigga drop the top, come through the hood
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot
(Ohhh can you believe it?)
Linen outfits, all on the bus
Cause none of us can see a summer without trips
Mad hot so the little boys might bother you
But they all act good if the hood bother you


Basketball tournaments, pitbull pups
Ladies in the club pourin Crist' in cups
Niggas in the jail callin home on the phone (cause they ""Locked Up"")
But you still tryin to act like ain't shit rough
Mad cyphers in the park, mad fights in the park
Niggas talk how they run every night from the NARC's
Outside from the light to the dark, then the dark to the light
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life

Can you believe it? I done spent ten again
Wtching her bend again, dancin for many men
Tell me have ever thought of gettin in
In a room full of Konvicts and D-Block militants
They'll show you the time of your life
You can occupy my passenger side
Introduce you to the street life
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Ohhh-ohhhh
All up in the club and you know how we roll

All the Way Up,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I had to play the block, ain't have a jump shot
The hood would love me if I go and get Trump shot
In public school had razors in my lunch box
Cutin' class beefin tryin' to cut ops
In Jr. High oh my we're playing with hammers now
We was bangin' so much, the hood got candles now
If there's beef we bring to where your trap at
I was popular before the gram and snapchat
Aw we cuttin' off these niggas twitter fingers
Aw we trigger happy BANG we hit your hitters
I DM your BM, you got bodied homie
She like damn they killed him and they got his rollie
Your main chick a freak, I pay for her first body
The year Pac died I caught my first body
My man like damn Murda you hot still
You know they tryin' to say Puff got Pac killed
I wonder how them people that love Pac feel
They like, Shug did that, that's not real
But you never know.  Puff got that fettuccine
Let me chill, Puff might send killers to see me
Before they was playin' Drake records
We was getting these chicks wet to Mase records
Basic chicks thinking they famous
Cause they bartending at Lustful Aces
She tryin to come up
Got her body done up
Got that tummy tucked
She went to D R took the fat out her stomach now its all in her butt

Sitting here watchin these niggas
I see no threats.  I mean none at fucking all
All the way down till I'm all the way out
Nixin them dimes even pull them trays out
Got a couple waps right up in your bae's house
Got some bricks in the East but they ain't at Dave's house
Got some K's up in Harlem but they ain't at Slay's house
2017 Imma pull that Range out
You thinking 'bout the Jeep, Imma pull my aim out
Cause you yellin ""gang, gang"" but don't know what gang about
Oughtta blow your brains out, but I be on that juice
I be movin' veggies in, I be movin' fruit
Got a line on the plug, nigga keep me in the loop
Yeah, I lost a little wait but I still ain't need a scoop
Hit you in your cheek, then your face goin' droop
I be yellin' ""Peace!"" cause I'm about peace
But I could be a thousand deep on anybody's street
Always go dolo on the creep with the heat
I don't do Co-Ds, I don't do witnesses
Niggas talk that murder shit, better know what friction is
Love to hear the gun clap, that's what addiction is
Always did my homework, that's what a mission is
Every line burn we're the biggest, like syphilis
Catch me loungin out, right there on St. Nicholas
113th, right at 
Kill one, I kill ten, then I say we even
Why the fuck you breathin? I don't even know it nigga
Feds want us gone, we don't even grow it nigga
Actin' like you know a nigga? That'll get you killed
At least in a coma, act like you know the deal
Thought you was a player, act like you know the field

I wanted juice, but I got a shooter
Video a nigga that swear that I'm not the truth
And
 say I never lied is a fuckin' lie
But who the fuck are you, who the fuck am I?
My mind is a prison and I'm stuck inside
Tuck a nine, fuck a dime
Get that money now, I don't know about another time
I only rhyme cause I love to rhyme
I work hard and yeah, me and the plug is fine
Could flood any 'hood with a ton of dimes
But I show my son my other side
Tell my daughter how it goes when a mother rise
On some other shit
Love a rubber grip, a key flip, Moët on a yacht, never sea-sick
Then get back home, you can see sick
You ain't got to look at the toilet to see shit
Got a gun I call havin' to take a mean piss
I let it go cause they said I wouldn't be shit

You on my side, or the other side?
You on my shit, or some other shit?

Watch the clouds move, hear the waves hit

I could turn a zip to a pound on the pavement
Feel good when the clique get the same whips
The jail on sale, but it's the slave-ship
 the orange and blue Asics
What did you learn in the basics?
Highrise vibe, but the flow's from the basement
Drink liquor, get more liquor to chase it
Burn weed, get more weed to replace it
Believe what you have faith in
Things that hurt you, a virtue to have patience
Do you want a estate or a state pen?
Do you want a good brother or a great friend?
Make end's meet or meet who make ends?
Who does your circle affiliate with?
The line you walkin' 
Stand in your square, don't let 'em take shit
They think you a monkey, then go ape-shit

Strong as though...
For this occasion

This occasion, yes
Is there a story that makes God cry?
Can I bring weed to heaven and get God high?
They say the Pineal Gland is the God eye or the third one
Yours from the dictionary, Heaven is where my words from
Or maybe Hell
A gin in the crib can make your old lady crazy or your baby yell
You can hear my soul through the speakers in your JBL
That only take me a couple bars
Before I lust a chick, I would lust a car
Tryna beat time, a buck ninety'll up the odds
Before I stuffed paper, I would stuff cigars
Some smoke the pain away, some drink the pain away
Me? I take it in and breathe it out on a rainy day
Never a stingy nigga, willing to give the game away
Ghost stay low, yeah, I'm willin' to give the fame away

 have I...
Strong as though...

I go to sleep and travel, I know the beast can tempt me
I know the snakes can rattle but knowings half the battle
Headed up shit's creek, no one likes to paddle
Live in a high rise, no one likes the gravel
Fuck with the gangstas, no one likes to tattle
Went into war but no one likes to battle
Love loss is a blood loss
God make clay but what's the price that the mud costs?
Dirt got wet 'cause you sweat when you bust off
Knew it was a sin but you knew it was a win
Got close to the end but you knew it would begin
Got away with it before so you doin' it again
I would probably do the same
Seen the dark, seen the light, so I'm callin' it a game
See the clouds through the joint, so I'm callin' it a lane
It's the picture without the cam, so I'm callin' it a frame

 have I...
Strong as though...
For this occasion
For this occasion

Is life even worth the stress?
Used to wonder if I'm cursed or blessed?
If I can't fly high, will it hurt the nest?
If I don't clear my mind, will it hurt my chest?
Is it a place on the Earth for my soul to rest?
Will I make it through the gates to see the golden crest?
Will I stay with the wise or where the soldiers rest?
My testaments are dry but didn't know the test
But I inhale the weed to get to know my breath

If Christ resurrected and came right now, bet a lot of niggas'll miss him and other niggas'll diss him
I'm givin' you game right now 'cause a lot of niggas is lost and others is in the system
If Muhammed came through in a kufi that's sky blue, with a Navy blue robe, would you follow him, Piru?
Should I build with the Gods since the Devils destroyed?
But niggas destroyed, too, when we never employed
I think, pain feel better than joy, when the valley low
But I hit my peak when I'm geeked up in Cali, though
Vibin' off the green, it's survival in my scheme
Is the good word dirty if my bible wasn't clean?
I ain't talkin' to the pastor 'cause it's faster when I dream
I be building with the sheck without the cards in my deck
'Cause the hand I was dealt just seems incorrect
We could talk about the other side, you wanna get in-depth?
But, you gon' owe me somethin', do you wanna get in debt?
Yeah, I'm somethin' like a scientist, the shit that I dissect
All love if it ain't, then it's blood on your Giuseppe's

Never seen clock hands made out of sands
But it's the sands of time
Sittin' in the hourglass, dance with the devil and you ate
Now you gotta fast, strong so you gotta last
Ever felt so much pain that you gotta laugh
Paid dues, throw your shoes on, yeah, you got a path
Build your enterprise, niggas is all desensitized
Kids gettin' killed and you worried about your mentions, right?
Well mention this, you can smell the stench at night
The beast out, tellin' my niggas peace out
Knowin' it's no peace out, might pull a piece out
Fuck about police, them niggas'll air your niece out
Your nephew, all of your kids, this shit's a cesspool
So I try to stay in the cut, lightin' the jet fuel
Basic, try to meditate so I could shapeshift
Above norm, meanin' I can only form greatness
Tryna shed light in the diabolical places
Souls everywhere, no chronological placement
Illuminati high, my weed jar is a mason
Travel agent P sendin' rappers on vacation
Fallin' to temptation, try your hand
Have your man lookin' up like, ""why my man?""
Don't ask God, or ask him, ask me
Only way to pass me is to pass speed
Any rapper try me, that's his last deed
Extraordinary Gentlemen from the last league
What's a good bag of weed, if it got a bad seed?
You a crab, meet another crab by a crabtree
Do some crab shit cause y'all wouldn't understand me

It's rule to this shit, got to learn the game
Got to earn your name
Work on your craft, roll a wood, got to burn your pain

Bullet ‘bout as big as a can they put a soda in
End up in the trunk of a car that got odar in it 
I don’t sip the liquor, I take a gulp
Fuckin’ with a nigga, that’s strong enough to face the hulk
44 long cuz Shorty was all wrong
Thought he was thugged out, now his face is all wrong
I don’t care about their fam, I’ll make them all mourn
There were Biggie and Sean Combs was taking broads home
On the phone with the chick. Crystal bitches bitches
And ace hoes, it’s money in my name like Ma$e though
Body broad daylight, nigga no case though
Fuck the funny money niggas, I get straight dough

Niggas talkin’ like they got something for me

Hit you with a hundred then I blow it in the air

Outcome was the same
Dead on arrival, death to my rivals

House full of dope with the pump by the doorway
True story, niggas'll shoot for me
But I ride out, you heard more than a few stories
I wild out, throw you off of a 2-story
Nigga, just to break your leg
Your connect got the work, nigga tryna break an egg

No wifeys or homies ride by myself
Now what I’m going do I’m beside myself
I never had wings but I can fly myself
I’m B.I, I’m ready to die myself

Roll papers and some bamboo sheets
We can meet at high noon under these random streets
I smoke all day
Hitting the strain from west coast all day
Yeah I’m a playa but I can coach all day
Got me a pound but hit the roach all day
Tryna float all day

Armoured vest will stay the same like the G5 truck

Sometimes I might see myself
Cause only I know me

Nigga, call my team, we in Ralph, I don't give a fuck if you in Okinawa
Well prepared for that slime though, I go ham though, I'ont eat swine though
I take vitamins, I keep iron on me, guarantee I keep more than slime on me
(Early morning, drink cold coffee, patron and lime, shake the haters off me)
I ain't jump off the porch, I lived in these streets
And beast on these beats, a beast in these streets
Real as fuck, how could you hate my guts?
I was just waiting, I knew you hate my guts
Straighten your face when I walked in the place
You make it obvious that you ain't proud of us
A1FB, we global, don't even come around if we don't know you
Ever since we been in power, these pussy niggas been sour

Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
This that ""drink up with it"", and I can't smoke it less it
You drop the hits, they gon' get
Soon as you get rich, they gon' be
Yeah, they gon' hate when you get power
They gon' be sour, they gon' be sour

Need a six-month, run with the Mexicans
I don't touch the haze if the sour's on deck again
'Nother six-month, run with the Colombians
L-O-X concern is which, house to put the money in
Half a stack of them indoors, half a stack of them outdoors
Ride around in them Benzos, fuck it, nigga, we outlaws
And I ain't even mad if you mad at me
You came, on some sour shit, I came with a strategy
I ain't out to get swag money, but I'm into that hard money
Think about all my yard niggas, bathtub, now that's car money
I blow a lil' haze on the appetize'
But you knowin' what I'm lightin' if I have to fly

Sour, sour, sour
Sour, sour, sour
But you knowin' what I'm lightin' if I have to fly
Sour, sour, sour

Y'all gon die, so who gon cry for us

Pop niggas in the skull in they frame, shit
It's a body for a body for the love of the game
But niggas'll call the precinct with your government name
But I'm still loadin my guns, gettin it on
And if a nigga bury my man, I bury his mom
I was trained to dump in your face, jump over the gate
Hop in the hoop', grab a bird, get outta the state
Stay in the dirt, dog we like pieces of shit
Dealin coke like cars, come lease you a brick
Holiday bitch, I show you what a 38 special do
Turn niggas vegetable, salad ass niggas
Never send a coward around violent ass niggas
I'mma always bust my gun, use my knife
Ride or die, til the day I lose my life

Y'all know we in here!  Tell me who's in here! 
Y'all know we in here!  Tell me who's in here! 
You dealin with the streets,  you dealin with the thugs! 
You dealin with the set,  so y'all throw it up!

Ain't no rapper you name fuckin wit Styles
And I'll probably die young, shot in the war
But I ain't never give a fuck, and I always was wild
And I'd rather have a open case, than an open face
Kill every witness, I ain't goin to trial
And everybody's a gangsta, nobody's pussy
There's alotta niggas lying and I know who you are
Next time I go to jail, I ain't gettin the bail
I'mma kill a hundred niggas, right in front of niggas
When cops come through, they gettin it too
Goin out wit a bang, 'bout to start up a gang
Cocksucker, it's the Holiday crew
Get money, kill niggas, do robberies too
Cuz you fuckin wit the grimiest, sheistiest
Can't wait to die dog, life's a bitch


I'mma die screamin, fuck you, meet me in hell
Cuz I still got beef on my chest, and it gets no deeper
Look at the ink on my arm, I tattooed the reaper of death
And they call me Holiday, I let a slug go in your shirt
And wait for the leak in your chest
I'll probably black out, think about my welfare days
And times I had to sleep on the steps
Niggas don't want it wit me, you could call me arrogant dog
Until you get stabbed in the jaw
P'll run up in the hospital, stab you some more
Don't you fuck wit no nigga that be plannin for war

Boys that do nothin but buy sneakers and denim

And the young boys who keep the handgun and the pump in the car

Up in the hood, it's a lot of gangs and gangsters
But I'm a super gangster
I super grind, I'm tryin to get super paper
Told you I'm a super gangster

Kick it with the O.G.'s and the parolees
Light a blunt with 'em, tell 'em put out a stogie
The young boys that'll kill yo' ass over a Roley
Maybe even a Fossil; them niggas is hostile
Some ho-ass bitches that bag crack
Throwed up in they ass crack, leave with they bags packed
Go where you tell 'em to go
The O.G. number man who sniff a little blow off the federal note
The white boy that'll sell you a boat
Get your papers cleared up, old church lady that'll tell you it's hope
The politician that'll tell you to vote
And my jail niggas that always get it in, with a sock and the soap
What!

I'm a super gangster, I fly off haze
I'm invisible, nobody ain't seen me in days
I'll crush every bone in you, I ain't get paid
Got a gun with a laser that shoot out grenades

Fuck a truck, get the Sprinter, kick your feet up then
Hardest nigga, you don't believe me? We can meet up then
You slow down motherfucker, you should speed up 
I'm the type of nigga you see when your re-up ends
Come correct when you see the connect
I plant words in your head
Why you think I got weed on my breath?
Phoenix on the track, got The Chronic and Blue Yak
And you could try to flip but I wouldn't condone that
'Cause your shit gettin' split when you hit with the chrome strap

Yeah, yeah
'Cause you already know
One of the realest shit I spoke
I ain't gotta tell 'em 'cause they know me (Woo, woo)
Still movin' like the coolest OG around
Lion in the jungle but my soul deep (Soul deep)
Salute me when you see me like the OG in town (OG)

I ain't gotta
Around, around (Yeah, yeah)
So deep
The OG in town (OG in town)",https://genius.com/Styles-p-coolest-og-lyrics
Red Eye,Float,2013.0,"I go with it, I'm so with it
First class flight overseas, I'm low with it
Stretching out the chair, we ain't low in it
Thinking of a house in Cali, can I grow in it?
Throw a booth in the place imagine how I flow in it
Outer-space bars, OZ's to the face y'all
Ball, bottle, hot tub, in case y'all
Plush life, laugh a lot, smile a lot
Light it up, bottle pop
Blowing kush from San Diego to Ottawa
A long way from the days I used to bottle up
(A long way)
Keeping all of my feelings bottled up
Keeping all of the guns hollowed up
Now we getting rich, getting twisted like Oliver
Money pile it up, yeah
The first go around then again when we follow up

Money, Power, Kush, Sour, Haze, Aries, Pills, Powder
Pull it out, cock back, ligga lead fly 
Then a nigga gone on that rigga red eye

Living and driving in big shit
If I die tonight, fuck it, my kids rich
SIG shit, get your wig split
None personal, real nig shit
I'm on fire, you just smoking
Playing tennis with my connect, US Open
Blocks my office, no days off it
Loudest persons usually the softest
Coke is gorgeous, ice is flawless
It's repercussions that comes with all this
Gun off safety till they come and replace me
You know what they say, death comes in traces


More fun than a festival, Audemars and Oyster Perpetuals
Goon niggas that turn niggas to vegetables
Long as it's coke, being broke is unacceptable
Word to the zero that goes after the decimal
May I double the way I bubble
When ball is the shit that brought AI trouble
If rap had a Dave Stern, believe I'm him
Think not bet the money in your Levi's dead
Digital, analog, always had catalog
The bull for the matador, cause if I see red like the bulls do
Somebody is getting shot and won't pull through
Got more animals than a zoo do

Lick Shots,A Gangster and a Gentleman,2002.0,"(Styles)
Lick a shot for the predicate felons
And gangster niggas that know that
Doing their time is better than tellin
Don't tell dog, lick a shot for the graveyard shift
And all the hustlers on ninety-five for the graveyard prick
Lick a shot for this weed I need
Just to see clear, to tell the truth I can't breathe a ki
Lick a shot for the stick up kids that twist up wigs
Thats the shit that happens when you pick up bids
Lick a shot for the foreign car, American trucks
Old timers that'll throw a stack of presidents up
Got dice shooter slang, need a pistol to hang
But the P understand cause the ghetto is fucked
Lick a shot for the fiends
That got to go see the minors on the block to get medicined up
Lick a shot for the sake of licking a shot
And everytime I'm far away from home I'll be missing my block
D-Block nigga
(Chorus: Sheek)
Lick shots for the hood
Yeah nigga we good
Lick shots for the poor
We still gotta run from the law
Lick shots for the rich
I-95 moving them bricks
Lick shots for the crew
My niggas'll ride and I ride too
(J-Hood)
Someone lick a shot for D-Block cause thats what I'm on
Lick a shot for the niggas that ain't survive the storm
Lick a shot for all my niggas on the run
And lick a shot for all my real niggas that got bodies on they gun
Lick a shot for my niggas cause I know they'll do the same
For my niggas that run through the flames and walk through the rain
Lick a shot for all the niggas growing up in the slums
Blowing they spliffs with they razor blades under they tongue
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be banging they hammers
Sticking up stores, taking the tape out the video cameras
Lick a shot at all yall haters whether smaller or bigger
Lick a shot cause Hood ain't never been scared to pull a trigger
Lick a shot for all my niggas that be pumping they crills
When the beef start cooking they be bustin they steel
Lick a shot cause I ain't scared to
I lick a shot cause I'm prepared to
Black revolver with the matching hair due
(Chorus)
(Sheek)
I lick shots for my niggas in jail
23 hours in the hole, on life parole
My 
jack mack
 niggas, octopus wildin
Closest food they ever gettin to is city island
I lick shots for cos that hit niggas off for weed and don't care if you bleed
Just mind they business and go the other way
For the right price they could get you the yay
I lick shots for my thug ass niggas that'll put something in you
From they car and hit your face through the diner menu
Your body get numb, you swallow your tongue
Cough up blood, thats the work I do, what
I lick shots for my niggas thats not on tour
And gotta hustle to eat its the motherfuckin way of the streets
Pay attention
(Chorus)
(Jadakiss)
Lick shots for the little babies in the projects
Running around unsupervised with sharp objects
Lick shots for papi that give you the yay half price
And niggas that ain't ever been heard but they mad nice
Nobody tell when I squeeze at your men
Lick shots when your diesels at ten, I'mma see you again
Lick shots cause my record is clean
Middle of the street, broad day lettin it scream
If I'm lucky they'll squirt through your back
And after that I'll make sure I lick shots for the purple and yack
Lick shots just to guard your grill
To my nigga T in Green and my uncle in Arthur Kill
Lick shots for the S-L 6
Cherry red with them chrome things on it with the x-l lips
Lick shots for the niggas who got shot and ain't here
They say life goes on but it ain't fair

Money and Checks,Dime Bag,2018.0,"I mean, just pay me, hah

Laid back like a pimp in a Cadillac seat
Shoot it out like Hateful Eight at Minnie's Haberdashery
Now you know me to rhyme well and blow the weed pack
But you don't wanna see me spaz, you don't need that
Yo, bro, I had the Volvo full of work with the hammer in it
I see the po-po, I'ma skrrt
From a block where the dimes clip, but twenties do too
Try to cross a nigga, you'll find out how a twenty two do
You thinkin' of pocket size, I mean a rifle joint
You don't wanna be standin' where the rifle point
Yeah, it's papers and Europeans, acres of tall paper
Took rap money put it to crack for more paper
Speakin' on my past life, now in the present
Everyday I buy myself another present
'Cause the fast life, lookin' at the cash app
Made a lot more since my last nap
Shit is all fitted how I snap back

Niggas stuntin' for the 'Gram, yeah, this shit is all a joke
I dump a couple grams, yeah, nigga 'bout to float
Been told you I'm a wolf, give a fuck about a G.O.A.T
Catch me in a bubble whip, boxin' it, Glock in it
I said I'm from the hood and I thought you knew that I popped in it
Better ask niggas
Ratchet in the book bag, ridin' on a mountain bike, I pedal past niggas
I'm hood like what cup is the engine of the car
Blade goin' through your denim, give a fuck about your squad
Cross me, you lost me and that's a meetin' with God

Now where's the money that time buy?
Yeah, I'm always lookin' forward, God
But I'm recognizin' my hindsight
The mirror say I'm beautiful and wicked
If I'm talkin' to the plug, what's the ticket?
I ain't tryna kick it, I'm just tryna get it
Thinkin' about the bank account, how to add another digit
If we ain't breakin' bread and we ain't drinkin' wine and we don't smoke together, then you might get me lined
Maybe you describe me but only I define what I live and I stand for, I made my design

Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design

Tried to tell these niggas that I made my design
I'm a one-of-one, you was made on the line
Ever cross me, that's a blade in your spine
I'ma die a legend, you gon' fade with the time
But who am I to judge? It don't matter anyway
We the same energy, so you matter anyway
If I bust a fifty shot, they gon' scatter every way
If I hit a couple niggas, they gon' splatter every way
But I ain't on that time, I'm just really on the peace vibe
Tryna burn the leaf, make this money on the creep time
I'm a cold-hearted goon, anytime is heat-time
Earned a little money, homie, I'm just tryna keep mine

I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine
But then I had to grow, so I made my design

Self made, self medicated
Ice cube, Rubik's cube, mix should be celebrated
The cold puzzle
I rest where your soul goes to sleep forever
You should know, Cuzzo
You fuckin' with the homie from the haunted house
I could talk to the night and bring the mornin' out
Related to the sands in the hourglass
It's happy G Day when the hour pass
Plant a seed of love when a flower pass
Always pay attention when the coward pass
I'm here to get paid with the times, made man
I told you that I made my design

I am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind
Meetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line
Straight like six o'clock when I came with the nine

What Up What Up,The Hardest Mixtape Out,2016.0,"Nigga you ain't safe tonight
You runnin mouth I'll run in your house and strafe your wife
They don't wanna see the general surface
Shit, I throw the shoty to the genitals for general purpose
A lot of niggas hope I would slip
But I still got dope out of town and coke on the strip
If I don't want you to talk or want you to walk
Then Ima stab you in your tongue and poke up your hips
You really don't want part of this war
I'ma bring you to the house with garbage bags on the floor
You don't wanna trade shots with the P
I'll open your head like a had a doctors degree
I'm a bust-gun-ologist
Nigga, what up, what up, what up
You ain't met a nigga on some wilder shit
Wanna school the streets better come get a scholarship
Cold hearted criminals who I get my dollars with
Shit go wrong, same ones I bust the hollows with
Niggas think of murkin me
Crackas think of jerking me
Married to the streets, every days my anniversary
Heres my presentation, nigga spark the weed up
Thugs got they own nation, Ima be their leader
Better read the Psalms to your man
When I kick in the door with two nines in the palm of my hand
And the only think Ima ask is who Ima blast

All I do is get high and think of fading you off
Stay blunted and red, with one in the head
Holiday Styles, Call me S.P. nigga
What up, what up, what up

Ay, Yo
Ya'll niggas gon' listen
I don't got a pot to piss in
The nickled nine glistens
It's a fucking tradition
I let it empty out
Pop and rent the Bentley out
Leave niggas dead till their skin colors' sauerkraut
I drink heavy liquor
I'm on my Kelly shit
But over 18 with Louch I got a naked picture
I'm in the crack building, 
around crack children
Born that way and they mama ain't stop yet
They keep smoking, Ima keep serving, that's a bet
Call me a fucking menace, I never learned tennis
Only sport was pitching till the work finish
Niggas faces on the back of the milk
Old niggas getting cut up in the back of the silk
Rappin' the quilt is getting rapidly built
Robert Reford couldn't control the castle I built
Sheek Verses go through vests and polices shields

Let it empty out, trunk of the car
Don't you forget it, everybody could get it
Louch, the Gorilla
, call me a fucking menace
What up, what up, what up

Yeah
Yo, I sit behind gates
I'll never sign states
Appreciate love, never mind hate
I know I'm gon' perish, not before my time though
Run up in his condo and throw him off the terrace
If they ask me all I'm gon' say is that day I guess things wasn't falling his way
Don't Fuck with J, cuz I never put the Tommy up
Hit you and your mommy up
Directly in the back of the head like I'm behind the truck
In your Earth get the note, bullets burst in your throat
More money more problems but its worse when your broke
Everybody popping shit, couple niggas get it on
But not quite like David, Jason and Sean
Double R, D-Block, live since beat knock
Can't rely on the royalty check, I keep rock
Keep haze, flip six pounds every three days
And that's for like four years now, dog behave

Niggas know, Jada invented the slick talk
To K.I. niggas, kiss bullets or kiss 
.40 cal kiss, nobody hotter than moi
Nigga what up, what up, what up
All I do is get high and think of fading you off
Don't you forget it, everybody could get it
Jada, moi, S.P. nigga
What up, what up, what up

Everybody want Jesus to come, well I could send you to him
And all I needs my weed and my gun
I might shoot you on the stoop of the church, you's a bastard
My bullets move faster then coups that I murk
And I might need a sedative
They say I'm cool and I drop a lot of jewels
But I'm still fuckin' negative
Dog, I don't give a fuck
Niggas couldn't picture that
Stick you where you pitchin' at
Asking where the bricks is at
Any time I'm broke then my 9 mil is fixing that
Don't make me have to lift your hat, bloody your shirt
I'm in the cab when it go to get your mother from work
And I always make use of my gun
Hit the scene, shooting shit to smithereens
Like I'm Lucifers son
And I always got 
Bust my gun in broad day like I ain't got common sense
And how foul could this karma be
Still smoke a lot
Still in the hood
Still move coke in large quantities
Dog, I could body you
You ain't go to fear the real
Maserati with the  on the steering wheel
Yeah it's the Ghost again
See the bitch in most of men
To loud to shoot em, bring em over here I'm choking em
Yeah, I'm respecting the , slice you neck and your ear
And then torture you the rest of the year
From the school of hard knocks so the lessons is here

All I do is get high and think of fading you off
Stay blunted and red, with one in the head

You don't like me fuck you it's more than enough shots for ya
Your man ridin wit'chu bet he gettin shot for ya
I got some hand grenades nigga but they not for ya
They for some other shit
My man got robbed out of town and I told him I could cover it
He younger than me and wilder than me
He wanna kidnap a mother I said nigga you on some other shit
Slow down young'n, we gon' get your revenge
When the shit get real we got to go down gunnin
Said he got a set of grenades he got from Jamaican niggas
Said he goin through there and e'rything and shake a nigga
Nigga you buggin out
We gon' get that money and the work back, then we gon' slug it out
Slow down soldier, keep your composure
Stay quiet and close, then strike like a cobra
You can't attack now, they expectin you you pushy nigga
Give it 2 weeks, and they gon' think you pussy nigga

And we don't give a fuck how diesel they is

He young, get me thirsty but he listenin
Plus he know my M.O. so I ain't bullshittin him
Besides we was half on the work

But bein with the wrong driver on the wrong ride
Is guaranteed to get a fuckin passenger hurt shit

Told shorty to come home and just chill for a minute
It's been a long time we ain't build in a minute
He been deep down South keepin it trill for a minute
Now he back home, gettin his mack on
645i sittin on black chrome
I'm thinkin to myself, damn shorty mature
Got a hundred worth of ice, purple label velour
We got a dutch and we blowin it in front of the store
He asked how I was doin, who was in the studio
Which hood niggas was frontin, tryin to make a movie though
Block still buggin out, told a nigga truly yo
Fuck rap, I need to get a movie like Coolio
Then he blurted out they got us for six figures
Kicked down the door and he counted out 6 niggas
A bitch told him who did it, I told him the shit figures

Keep The Faith,Master Of Ceremonies,2011.0," 
What can I say? It's so real (oooohhhh, yeeeeeaaaaahh!)
I don't even feel like talkin' most of the time
It's ironic that I happen to emcee
Then I don't really wanna say shit
Kinda funny though
Huh

I always feel the ghost is amongst me
I remember times when the roaches was hungry
The livin' was grungy, if it's money I bungee until the cord breaks
Thinkin' that I might be the one that's in the Lord's way
Am I the bad that's provokin' the good
We all ride, all live and we smokin' the good
But my nigga on the reel to reel
We move stock, 'til we not for gettin' killed for bills
And it's all about the chills and thrills, and the good times
It's like the mob nigga, in it 'til the hood dies
Addicted to the concretes, addicted to the crates
If we don't get a connect, we stickin' up a wake
Whatchu know about a wake, with the bishop bein' late?
All my jail niggas standin' up, fists up to the gate
Faggot-ass C.O.'s get the piss up in they face
Hold a grudge cause the judge never listened to the case

Even though you feel like, cryin'
Just keep on smilin'
Believin' that, there is gonna be
Somethin' better past the pain
And even though it hurts, like hell
You, just keep on givin'
Don't stop moving and
It's all worth it in the end, you just keep the faith!

You can see it but you just can't vision it
Society judge a man for the way, that he live in it
Either you gettin' money or deal with imprisonment
No in-betweens - I'm gettin' green
Spots in the world where, they don't know what dinner mean
It's really not that crazy in the paint
Hear 'Clef in the club, have Haiti on the brain
Surrounded by liquor drinkers, niggas makin' it rain
And the world's always changin' but we still need change
Life's a bitch, is death like a good woman?
I ask that, cause I know the whole hood comin'
And the fam comin', and do heaven got
A ocean or a dam runnin' tryin' to understand somethin'
Flowin' like a feather in the wind
If It start off rough, do it get better at the end?
Do I go to a place, where I don't never have to sin?
Yeah!


I'm wicked in my ways cause my temperament
Ride for my crew and fuck, everybody's sentiment
You enter in the dragon or ""The Gangster and the Gentleman""
Saliva, is like poison, with adrenaline
I spread love to the point I hit the hate line
Fuck jail and state time but you ain't gon' take mines
It sucks when you livin' on gun terms
Rather be high on the island gettin' sunburned
Live 'til I'm old know what my daughter and my son learned
Life is all real my nigga, you get one turn
I'm tryin' to tell these boys that they oughta learn
It ain't just fire my nigga - even water burn
Yeah


Faith makes all things possible
Faith is the reality of, things I hope for
And the evidence of things not seen and told
Keep the faith y'all, just keep the faith y'all


Woah
Smilin'
Yeah, oh
Somethin' better past the pain
And even though
Hurts like hell, you
Keep givin'
Oh!
It's all worth it in the end, you just keep the FAITH!",https://genius.com/Styles-p-keep-the-faith-lyrics

But (It's Something About Mary) that they don't know
(They don't know) Got me open like Ben Stiller
Lookin for my lighter cause my friend got killer
Handin him a Dutch roll a ten my nilla
Know what I do with all of my scrilla

This is how I fly - tryin' to get loose so I light a light
Tryin to get right so ignite the lighter
I'mma be cool word to final flight
It's alright once you light that lighter
This is how I fly - tryin' to get loose so I light a light

Watch the (Tropic Thunder), (Me, Myself & Irene)

You ever seen a cloud inside?
You could be deaf and know it's loud inside
No E pill, no formaldehyde
I ain't knockin' you but this is how I fly
I don't need a airline to find my flight
All I need is my lighter and now I'm right

Where killers ride at, and OG's reside at
It's rugged son, I love it son I see it every day
Fuck that, we'll find another way to play
So don't mistake me for no rap artist
Missin old dude is from the old school
He abide by the old rules
And our pro-tools, is 38 longs
The crime rate will inflate, and the murder rate is strong
How could we get along
And you doing this underhanded faggot shit, you faggot bitch
We gotta get you gone, 
William Danze songs
All disloyal guys should be shot in they back
Once, and left paralyzed 
You gon change me how
What you thought would happen
When they chained me to Fame and Styles
You ask in the hood about it, all it can be is
L! M! O! O! X! P! motherfucker!

You keep thinkin when I flow pa, it's a wrap
But when your ass get beat wit a crowbar, it's a wrap
For real, we straight thug it
Read my palms, you see more chapters than L. Ron Hubbard
Huh, we done dealt more drugs than Genovese
Made dope fiends outta school principals and deans
Now they all fucked up, career finished
Got they ass noddin in front of the Metho-don clinics
We thug it all day, but it ain't the Henny in me
It's that Brownsville shit wit a splash of trinny in me
All I need is a hammer, and a clip load
I'll stomp, do whatever, state, borough, zip code
It's the M.O.P.! mashin through your ghetto
Rippin heavy metal,  wit Peniro
Listen up, y'all better respect the criminal shit of these OG's
What's poppin nigga


We can beef I don't give a fuck
Cuz if you kill me, I got niggas that'll bend up your son
It's the world's most gutterest
Paniro the Ghost, they thought of me when they invented the gun
To tell the truth I prefer the knife
Cuz he physical nigga
I go in your chest I show you how to murder right
It's deep, I'mma kill your mother
And I don't care if I die
Cuz all that mean is that I gonna join my little brother
Dog, I had a hard life
And I'm in love with the pain
Thug in the game wit heroin and hard white
Back to the guns the way I squeeze off threes off
Leave a hole in your stomach, take a nigga knees off
Face gets splattered around, too many cops for the Glock
Fuck it dog, then I'm battin you down
Don't you ask me what's happenin now
This ain't a rerun, niggas see P gun, I'm clappin you clowns, what
YOU DON'T WANNA TOUCH THIS
It's Paniro the Ghost, Goodfella like fucking Jim Conway
YOU DON'T WANNA TOUCH THIS
It's Lil Fizzy wit that Brownsville shit and splash of trinny in me
YOU DON'T WANNA TOUCH THIS
Bill, 38 long, the crime rate will inflate and the murder rate is strong
YOU DON'T WANNA TOUCH THIS",https://genius.com/Styles-p-yall-dont-wanna-fuck-lyrics
Look at Her,Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman),2007.0,"Ohh man, I mean
I gotta do somethin for the ladies, right?
It's that kind of beat right here Poobs
I feel it, let's go

Yeah, you told your man look at her
Then he was like, ""Damn look at her""
Knee boots, mink shirt, top made of fur
And now you like, ""I wonder where she work""
She on the dance floor, you like the twist and the jerk
She sweeter than Ms. Butterworth
And now you like, ""Ma, who you?
Got 'em sick like the flu how you dipped in Lou""
She remind you of your first .22
She real small with a lot of bang
You give her a ring cause you and her gotta hang
She swear to God that, you and her got a thing

It be like, ""Damn look at her""
Nice face, nice waist - damn look at her
It be like, ""Damn look at her""
Nice hips, nice lips - damn look at her
It be like, ""Damn look at her""
Nice eyes, nice size - damn look at her
It be like, ""Damn look at her""
Nice walk, nice talk - damn look at her

She look good in her gym clothes in fact
With a little Air Max with the pins in the wrap
All her friends are tens or similar to that
Got a walk for the runway; talk that can fund-raise
With a smile that look brighter than the sun ray
And she's a real classy chick
You know the type that you probably see a athlete with
A rapper, actor, or a activist
Or a C.E.O. dude that had to be rich
Or a drug dealin kingpin that have them bricks
You like, ""Damn if I could have them hips, or I could have them lips""
You look at her, and imagine this


Yeah, you was like, ""Damn look at her""
She remind you of a car, it's probably the flyin spur
Or maybe it's the Audi with the real good curves
You tryin to get up in her ear with the feel good words
Felt real confident, know you was willy
Told shorty that she was sweeter then the strawberry Phillies
Said some old school stuff like, ""Boy you was silly""
Then you hand her over your jacket, you knew she was chilly
Now you got her, she got you, you all in the spot too
You like her, she like you, both of y'all hot too
Now it's goin down and the plan occur
And you got her in the bed like, ""Damn look at her""",https://genius.com/Styles-p-look-at-her-lyrics

You could call me alotta things but don't call me broke
And I told you I bust my steel
I stay cuffed in the bullpen like P you bout to fuck up your deal
But I told you I make my bail
I'm at home in the alcohol bath tryin to shake the jail
And I'm pickin up my automatics, automatically
I got a bad habit makin' people mad at me
Dog, I'm just tryin to get paid
Cop some jewels too, act like a fool too, run and get laid
Ten million for the crib put the gun on the maid
Weed on the chefs, so I can get high with the meal
Got to get my head right 'fore I fly to Brazil
Make my sheets outta hundreds so I can lie in a mil, what up

Catch me in the skybox in any arena
I won't be happy til I cop my niggas 50 medinas
But I'm tryin to be realistic, and I get really twisted
So I'm settlin for seventy beamers
Somebody call Bill Gates, tell him meet with the streets
One on one so I can get some real cake
Tryin' to see my shit in the Forbes,
 
Trump Tower for 'self
So you know I'm still pitchin the boy
And the niggas need lottery numbers
Charge this ?? freak DeCalis and Hummers
Blow smoke in the sky till the Air Force come
Cop 50,000 pair of Air Force Ones
And if I can't live it up, then I'm runnin up
In the record label tellin everybody give it up, what up


I kill lemonade peeps
It's Holiday with the fruit punch Ferarri and the lemonade seats
Face look really aggy, jeans really baggy
Fitted hat, white T and some Bruno Magli's
Doublin and flippin
You understand I need a house so big I need a shuttle to the kitchen
That's why I keep the 45 government edition
Sofa costs a hundred, so do the love seat
The big screen is crazy and I'm lovin the conditions
I got a vision and it's cash involved
Can I get paid, or you get sprayed

Right before you go to cop the cane pull the hoop around

Green Piece of Paper,Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman),2007.0,"It's a lot of pain (a lot of pain)
You learn to live with it though (know'msayin)
Things we do

Hungry, starvin in beast mode
Live by the street code, where niggas take your shit like the repo
The boys'll sell crack, to your mother if you're good (damn)
So-called brother in the hood (brother)
Lord help us (Lord help) you gotta know we possessed (y'know)
I guess it's the stress that make us a hot mess
It's somethin on the chest cause none of my niggas rest (none of them)
Graveyard shift; my guns with the laser spit
'Til you're hit, all the tissue come off (off)
Nobody go to church but they hustle to get across
Who am I to argue or fight or bicker (who am I)
When, I could see my demon in the cup of the liquor
Reflection, my section, shit's gettin thicker (shit's thick)
Cause love don't mix with the liquor - you should know that
Gun, knife or bat I'm yellin out hold that
Twenty, fifties or hundreds, you know I'm tryin to fold that

I live my whole life for a green piece of paper (five)
Did some trife shit, for a green piece of paper (ten)
Did some hype shit, for a green piece of paper (twenty)
A green piece of paper (fifty) a green piece of paper (a hundred)

In the game for mad years, paid a whole lot of dues in it
Never bite the hand that feeds you (never) but the rules is different
When the hand that feeds you ain't got food in it (what do you do then?)
Room full of scholars, bet you it's a fool in it (I bet you!)
Yeah, I learn my wisdom from the wise (whattup)
But then I learned livin from the lies (salute)
Both drop the same jewel boy, better get it it's your time (no it ain't)
But nope I say it's God time
I'm just a maker of hard rhymes, due to the hard times
Skin's real thick, you could look at the scar lines
Sometimes in my mind, I be still on the yard time
Hittin the bar time; crunches to the push-ups to the dips (yeah)
But real niggas push up with the clips (that's what it is)
My niggas is raw, you heard right, no cook up in this bitch (no cook up)
Let it go you better duck, don't look up in this bitch (don't look up)
We came to body somethin, we ain't shook up in this bitch (we ain't shook)


I did some trife shit, and hype shit (yeah)
On the grind every night that's why I don't write shit (why I don't write)
Used to go hand-to-hand, rob niggas man-to-man
Hoppin out the hoopty or the van cause I ain't have a plan (I ain't have a
Plan)

Where papi comin through with them bricks by 8
Listen cocksucker and clown, I'll be leavin you cut
You're like a dutch, how I'm bustin you down
Niggas drivin in a circle wit'cha ho in the back
'll be the only damn way I be fuckin around
And I'm aimin for your waist, hopin you duck
So I can bust you in the head when I'm buckin the pound
And I told you that I'm Holiday Styles, let's celebrate
Heard you gettin money, I'll rob you right now
And you gon' get popped in the head, true story
Crips do they thing in blue, Bloods pop off in red
Me, I'm on the move only stopping for bread
Double R and D-Block nigga, copper and lead, whattup

Stay in the zone
I don't know why the fuck you amped yo
Got hoodrat bitches, carryin birds on the public transpo'
Niggas in the hoods that go out like Rambo
They hot since 138th had that cancelled
Young buck... dumb fuck
I'm two guns up, ""Ryde or Die"" 'til the sun's up
""Gangsta and a Gentleman"" dog, I got class
I'mma send a bunch a roses to your men in the morgue
I'll be down South bendin a whore, ten in the morn'
Dirty on 85 like Jay, Barnes, Sean Paul
Beef with New York rappers, I'm killin 'em all
On my Slick Rick shit, y'all could ""Lick the Balls""
I been cool cause these niggas is ass, but fuck that
Might as well call me pool cause I'm gettin splashed
And that Lamborghini liftin the stash, even gettin the mass
While some haze to mix with the hash, whattup

Pass that blunt nigga!
I'm in the hood where the eggs get knocked off
Gang members find they family members with both of they legs chopped off
Niggas ain't scrappin, they bangin ya
The judge don't need a tree branch when they hangin ya
All y'all fags'll get ate like clams
Since this is a ""Bloodsport"" bitch, you could call me J Van Damme
All these so called guerillas be tellin
How a rat gon' give you ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon,"" muh'fucker
Homey what you want, the blade or the slug
I'm the one that send the order when they sprayed up the club
Bitch nigga, bow your head in the presence of G's
Load the lead up and squeeze; I'm a great dane, niggas is fleas
Fuckin rats can't wait to call cops
'Til I make 'em sick and put pellets in they mouth like cough drops

Drug dealer fly, which car to put the Fendi in
I'm in a condo on a Louis couch
New York fly nigga, California gooey out
Mobster, know I got the tooly out
Cops come, you don't even put the doobie out
From the block, them niggas will make a movie out
Everybody fly like they got gear from groovy house
G'd up, know what you out for
I get high riding out to the Outlawz
Broke right hand, load the southpaw
Get off the turnpike, different route ya
How I know they sent a different scout ya
Trying to figure out, how the cat got the mouse ya
Trying to figure out, how the dog got the cat ya
From the hood where they let it go blat! ya
Weird science, simple math
Take a cab wherever you got the rental at
Check the spot wherever the connect sent you at
Check the credit of homie that fucking lent you that
Word!

Smoke break, at the table bagging up snowflakes
9 mil at my waist, but I don't feel so safe
Cuz a lot of niggas is dos face
I mean two face, bitches get yo'food laced
I don't stay in the spot unless the mood straight
I rather be mad high in my new place
Rather be mad high in my old place
Wondering if the pearly gates is white like Colgate
A lot of dollar bills, can't fold straight
Cuz the knot thick, told you that the plots thick
You in the way, you gon' hear the Glock click
God bless this ignorant and obnoxious

European American, V's with the smoke tints
Ten rack, black label suit with the smoke scent
Meet the connect by the ocean
I do my deals on the beach
Up to my neck in the water, and it ain't sweet
Cuz trust is an issue
The ice pick tip with the rust gon' hit you
It cut through your tissue
Cuz you could go to jail, niggas'll act like they miss you
It's only when they see you, when you gone they forget you
I fell in love with the money, and lust with the pistol
Always hated the cops, say fuck when they get you
I still ""Kill Bill"" ill, monster from ""300""
Talking money to G's want it
We roll up then we load up
It's a cocaine deal or a hold up?
I could care less about the set that you throws up

Came from nothing, used to have nothing
Now I'm somebody and I got a lil something
Rich nigga, Ritz nigga
You don't know this nigga
I don't like snakes, i'll kill it if it hiss nigga
Rat nigga, snitch nigga
Rap nigga, fuck 'em all
My posse over there tell your girl to go suck em off
They say I'm underated, I just be getting faded
Cuz niggas'll have your name all on the affidavit
I find it fascinating
I know how to kill em all, holiday'll kill em off
When ghost procrastinating
You could see the holy ghost
I stretch your flat ? , take some herb in your pocket
You could call that the holy smoke
We ain't cut from the same cloth
I'm the boss, we couldn't work for the same boss
Point blank nigga, I would shoot your brains off
In the spot, the manteca and the cane soft
But you know that the bass hard
Dealer death and there ain't no safe card
That's Alchemist, this is Alchemy
Sniper on the balcony, higher then the Falcon be
It's a pack of wolves and you know I'm where the alpha be
Guns go north, but the drugs go south for me
If anybody is out for me
Better go the fuck in, cuz I'm gonna go the fuck in
New York fly, California high
Miami hustle when I get up on a pie
Down south lean, midwest bounce
And I wanna double up, it's the buck that counts",https://genius.com/Styles-p-the-myth-lyrics

Damn you fly, why lie when I get high
All I do is think about how I'mma ride them thighs
I ain't never been one to make no girly songs
But I'll be up in this chick 'til the early morn'
Mighta came with some Temples but those Shirleys gone
She laughin makin a joke she gon' sell out porns
Got me head over heels, puffin on a dutch
Thinkin to myself, might spread some bread for some wheels
I might be wrong, but honey is right
Got to have my back strong when I come for the night
Her ""Milkshake"" bring my ass to the yard and we don't care
If we do it in the telly or the back of the car, what?

You're my favorite drug, get me high
Like the skies above, yeah
Feels like I'm in love, I'm so high

Stoned as usual; pickin up my chick
We gon' bone as usual; she been talkin shit
On the phone as usual - pull up on the block
In somethin real nice on chrome as usual
Either one of us don't care where we headed
Park the truck, get a dutch, watch ""American Wedding""
I like her cause she cool, graduated school
Got a mean stick in pool
Cut a nigga quicker than me she a fool
When everybody flip she was still playin rules
She the shit like some stools
I'm open like the windows is
Everytime we have sex I'm in limbo kid
And she make me stop quicker than my brimbles did
So no longer do I care where the fuck them other bimbos is
She's my favorite drug, the shit so serious
Me, her and purple, point black period


Me and her been doin it far too much
'Til the 55 box of cigars is up
Right before checkout time is the hardest nut
The valet call the room and say the cars is up
A dutch and a shot, that's what P thing is
Then I be all up in that ass like them G strings is
She is my favorite drug, so is the purple
So I get 'em both together then I blaze 'em up

Now hell is a place we live
Cause the race we is, I mean race we are

It ain't candy so I don't want a taste of the bars
Ain't a ball game, I don't wanna sit at the court
Do a long bid, I don't wanna give that a +Thought+

I'm a have-not, grandma's grandma suffered
You just mad we hustled right out of the struggle
Let it rain nigga, we gon' dance out in the puddles

Klan in the schools too, where should my daughter go?
Where should my son go? Let me know what {?} is hung fo'
I'm too Black to not dream like Martin did
Die like Malcolm, a martyr to be part of it

So I keep rollin' up
But he ice grillin' and he swollen up
But he ain't old enough to never see another day
I'm thinkin' this but I ain't put my gun away
He act, I'ma clap, and these people gon' run away
They gonna get my plates and the make of my vehicle
I'ma be upstate full of hate tryin' see it through

I'ma catch 'em all alone then I'm puttin' work

Get a shell in a hoodie, knife in a cardigan
You see me throwin' the peace sign
That two could turn to two guns up when it's creep time
Slug through the peephole, now he sleep though
He the one askin' for sleep time
Test me, you gotta wait your turn B
Get a bag full of guns and prepare for the journey
Get six pallbearers, a couple attorneys
You gon' either not leave or leave in a gurney

I can't be humble - e'rybody bougie and industry
But me, I'm in the concrete jungle
Where rap about your cash'll get your mouth bloodied up
Run in your house, real late, you and your wife buddied up
I can't afford to rap about no cars with no 24's
Shorties on my block is real, hard with they 44's
I know some teenagers, that'll strip you like a female
Take your jewels off, when you get your car detailed
Sell it half price, like they got it on retail
Put you on the ocean floor, right by the seashells
They all got the look, like they'd ride on you
Take it easy young boys I got my eyes on you

I got my eyes on you!
And I'm posted on the corner with that thing on my side
Said I got my eyes on you!
It's a message to them stick-up kids, don't even try
Used to be a bad lil' shady nigga just like you
And I pop that ass one by one, plus two
Got my eyes on you!
Along with my whole squad ready to ride, yeah

Where I come from, you don't get caught slippin
You don't get caught trippin
Cause if you fall down then it's ""Off wit him""
Another one off in the wood box
Man'll get revenge cause that's how the hood rock
Mighta been different if, he had a good pops
The war go, on every day but it should stop (should stop)
And them killers gettin younger and younger
I guess it's the hunger, so they cockin back and takin you under
And shorty got his eyes on me, I got my eyes on him
I know the look so I'mma ride on him
I'mma catch his ass slippin then slide on in
It's a pool full of sharks, boy dive on in


You know I keep the thing on the corner
Them shorties on the block is real wild, you make a move you a goner
Moms gon' be a mourner, family gon' be pissed
You should know how it is, you raised on the G strip
Grams to the bricks, O's to the pound
And the strap and the clip is for, holdin it down
Get a hole in your shirt, or your hat knocked off
Cause them shorties got gats and they thirsty to pop off
The nights is short, the days is long
I blame the crack-head parents that raised them wrong
My dutchie is long, my haze is strong

Listen,A Gangster and a Gentleman,2002.0,"I gotta few things I wanna ask the Lord
Why my people gotta be so poor, feel me
And why's it so rough when you're young and black
They say you go to jail or get strung on crack
Why the girl have a baby she was twelve years old
Ask the state why the cell's gotta be so cold
And why these niggas here with so many years
Whole family in court crying so many tears
Can you picture us living with hope 
When the same ones hanging us is giving us dope
Shit, it's hard to get by
I pray to God it's still hard to get by
Just wanna hold my son 
But I can't leave my house until I load my gun
I gotta grab my sword
And when I die I got some things I wanna ask the Lord
Like, why we dying from AIDS
And why on TV it's aight to be gay
Ain't that sorta like my gun got the right to be waved
If I could sit back and watch a whole cipher of slaves
Ask my man where the blacks at
Ask myself where the next Malcolm X at 
Is he makin Salat, or upstate like a ape in a box
Am I a human or a fallen angel
Got to pray by myself cuz I'm out of angle
I ain't facin the east, tell the brothers I was shakin the beast
Had the nine and the eight in the streets
Open your eyes, stay wise, cuz even Satan is deep
I pray for a better living
Even though I think I'm better dying
Why, cuz I'd rather hear the angels singing
Why, and I don't wanna hear my people crying, feel me black

We ain't gotta die no more, I said we ain't gotta die no more
Black woman Listen
You ain't gotta cry no more, I said you ain't gotta cry no more
Black child Listen
We gotta provide for y'all, I said we gotta provide for y'all
Devil man Listen
We got a surprise for y'all, I said we got a surprise for y'all
Black man Listen

'Bout to be on some clever shit 
I gotta think if the president is prejudice
And that's another eight years down
The 500 year warn, that's a eight year round
I don't really mean to sweat it
But the war been on before they came on your TV and settle
They don't need lead to shoot ya
Why would a man make a computer to head the future
I think about it in a weed session
They said better technology, all I see is regressin
Blew up our buildings in fact 
But if they live under the sun then them children is black
'fore the devil get more time I'd rather see the world cease
Hit the afterlife of world peace
Where black men don't die, the women don't cry
And the little kids get provided for and play in the sky, what",https://genius.com/Styles-p-listen-lyrics

I was tryna make dollars just so I could pay rent
All my niggas stay bent
Came from the pavement

Hundred hoes, we ain't doin' that, win a hundred stores
We gon' need a hundred farms, we gon' need a hundred groves

Can't work for minimum wage nigga, to tell the truth
That's why I live in a cage nigga
Soon to be dependin on haze nigga, shit and I ain't pretendin
When a crook get a book with a happy endin'
Dawg I'm in the bad mood most the time
Nine milli' have you close to dyin
But it's senseless, when I can let loose
And just spit a sentence of some absurd shit
Like four cars copped off of one bird flipped
I know crime ain't rhyme but I prefer this

This is the real shit, givin niggas real fits
And if you can't handle it
Then you ain't been where I been
And you ain't been where I been
This is for real shit, givin niggas real fits
And if you can't handle it
Then you ain't been where I been
And you ain't been where I been, this is for real

Die fo' what you believe in
Get high for numerous reasons, no confession, 
no Jumu'ah
Just me in a dark room and the fumes that I breathe in
Spirit leave the physical, leave off the Earth
Then I breeze on the burst cause I'm cursed with bein lyrical
Dawg I decapitate niggas, I never was yellow
But I'm nicer than the happy-face sticker
All I need's a beat and the mic gloved up
Your career's goin good 'til you're bumpin into me
And I hit you with some shit that make your life fucked up
Only thing to stop me from killin you sloppy
If God intervene or Christ jump up... what?
 w/ ad libs

Shit's close to the end and I ain't a beginner
Think I got a little thinner, only thing I mean is that
Everybody dinner - this the house of pain
Tell everybody in there, I'mma bring it to 'em right
Money burn, guns fire, led finger to a life
Change your address, feds follow when they glue the kite
Shit is all love, same time it's real too
Move OT or go and kill 'em 'fore they kill you

Black what up?
Let’s Go Fools
 
Whatever rapper think he the best he the copy
Need to see me, I run the city you need a block
Whoever your shooter is
Should know who the shakers and movers is
Know where the dealers and jewellers is
Hand on the gat, that’s such a medula kid
The good, the bad, the ugly
When Vince made buggy eyes
Homicides occur whenever the money rise
You don’t want your brains on the sunny side
Eggs sinking, legs crushed
I ain't never rapped, never said much (never said shit)
Niggas fed up in the fed clutch
Niggas on the run in the dress or they dread up
I know the pain well cause I come from it (I knew the pain)
A nigga catch a body then he run from it
Loading up the clip you hollow tip for dumb dummy
That’s if you out there like that
You never let a nigga say “I’ll be right back”

Shooters, Hustlers, Private customers
You ain’t bout that life then don’t fuck with us
You about that mob then get in touch with us
But we ain’t God so don’t trust in us
 
The only thing I fucking trust is just my word and my nuts
Maybe my words, my nuts be on they shit when they bust
That’s all I got though
Trust no man, woman or gato
Pussy got the power to turn the nigga to fossils
All you dimes out fucking these whores getting sores
Getting divorced cause shorty came to your door
Poor decision, forced admission, lost with your flawless wisdom
You ain't listen, causes a four collission
That’s the truth nigga
Bet your crew would be aloof
Quicker than mute 
If other dudes would pull triggers
And that’s sad, high fives and a back stab
When you need a nigga he gone like a bad dad
Fuck custody, trust is just a false luxury
Sleep with one eye open long enough you do it comfortably
It’s all about developing habits
Watch you watch your own back before you fall in the casket

 
I’m an animal but I’m civilised
I’m sophisticated but niggarised
It’s the fly shit that I visualise
That make a nigga ride, till a nigga die
So it’s all for the green
Or the dream in the nightmare or the nightmare in the dream
I don’t go to sleep so ya’ll don’t know what I mean
You can look where I’m looking but ya’ll don’t know what I’ve seen",https://genius.com/Styles-p-never-trust-lyrics

Lovin' the streets, so I ain't that pressed to put on a vest
Watchin' Wade, everybody think that they winnin'
Season started later, press me, do it from the beginnin'
Still Kobe; whips European, Ginobli
We smoke weed like it's a bogey; I'm so high
Drink, pop a Vicodin, and Donnie ready to fly
O-T trunk full of Lady Gaga
I clap at these niggas for Kiss; I be a blood donor for P
If he ask me, I'd cut off my wrist, and let it drip into his I.V
It's all real; Donnie G dot, dot, millionaire
They ask me, ""is the feeling gone?""
Push button, bitch; ask me where the ceiling gone
Winter time; heat blowin' with my ice showin'
Ayo Styles, do me a favor (what?), keep flowin (ok)

So what I blow weed and keep plenty of hash on me?
Run up in the spot with the burner and mask on me
Sold cocaine, and keep plenty of cash on me
I lay you out if my homie is askin' me
You don't understand, then you got some audacity
Street life is rough, yeah, it takes some tenacity
Louch say ""kill 'em"", or Kiss tell me to ""kill 'em""
I'll blow your brains out, nigga, I'm thick with 'em
I'll smoke a nigga and tell 'em the fifth did, dutch did it
Go 'head, nigga, fuck with it
Come through with your ice; I'm gettin' you stuck with it
Go 'head and play the man if you want
You know Ghost, dumpin' seven grams in the blunt
And I got the killers in the van in the front
Mad high, like so what nigga?
You don't like me? Fuck you; you  nigga

So what we pack guns? Put hash in our weed
So what we sell drugs? We got kids to feed
We hustle all night
Fuck hoes and get right
And you know we love to fight",https://genius.com/Styles-p-so-what-young-wild-and-free-freestyle-lyrics

I don't see the trip, estate 'rounds in them flip flops (Nah)
Shit, I'll be prayin' five times or
Holdin' five nines, let me tell you how I slipped, doc (Let me tell you)

Livin' out the wrong dream (Wrong dreams)
Crossed a lot of times, I ain't die on the stake, so (I ain’t die)
What it’s gon' take to see what the Lord see? (What it gon’ take?)
Know the path of Muhammad and the liquor and the chronic
But I'm numb to the word like I'm a Thorazine (I'm numb)
Everybody’s a brother (Ayy) until they say they ain't
Love is love, if it ain't, then I let the four beam

Sweatsuit got a couple thou of hundreds, nigga
You thinkin' I'm frontin'? Nigga, 'scuse me, pardon my back (Pardon my back)
Little homie got the uzi, he partin' your back (What up?)
If you ask can you live then you can't (Can't)
You do what you could and I do what I can (I do)
All they said I couldn't do just to prove I'm the man (I'm the man)
Not a werewolf or lion but the times are the sand (Oww)
My mind is advanced, put time in a trance
Throw a sign to the sky just to line up a chin (What up?)
Nigga, this is ghost talk, you hearin' the Ghost rhyme (You hear me?)
Put you in a ghost trance, you are on Ghost time

Jadakiss is a gangster, gangster
Styles P is a gangster, D-Block
Won't you come fuck with a gangster, gangster

You don't get nothin but gun shells
I ain't on the bar, Louch pass me the dumbbells
I'm in war mode, they in more mode
Body after body so the story was foretold
Twist 'em up real tight just like a cornrow, stick in they hair grease
Bullets in ya eye and your earpiece
Bullets whistle like canary for canaries
Your stones is yellow but so is the owner
Ain't a Blood but I'll make him a donor
Crash the whip at the dealer tryin to get me a loaner
Got a spliff that I dipped in Corona
Fuck around make you sip some ammonia
Karma, put your ass in a coma
Ain't nobody give a fuck if you paralyzed
'Kiss pass the saw so I can shave down to barrel size
Said he was the king 'til he looked in the pharaoh eyes
Blow was the bulb was the verse as the arrow ride
What nigga!


Yup, AH-HA!
Yo, you ain't got to remind me, I'm a top-of-the-line G
If you a fan you can say I been poppin since 9-3
If you my man then you know I been poppin my whole life
Outside 'til it's finished my nigga, the whole night
Few contract and inkpens later
Turn into boss respect, mob ties and kingpin paper
Mountin the D, Cardi frames and pink Gators
Gotta learn how to deal with the weak link haters
Don't even think about the top 10, just think Jada
Never equal or less than, I think greater
Gambino affiliate - still transport bricks
A boy on a bike, while my man willie it
Silly shit, imagine how rich we could really get
Fuck a pool table, the crib got a billiard
Streets is our problem, hope Allah's got 'em
Three-piece purple label with the hard bottoms - gangster


Silverback! No doubt (yeah)
That's you son, aiyyo I got you though
Aiyyo straight out the gate I pack heavy, big Chevy
24's, bandanna like I'm one of the outlaws
4-4 sit on my lap, other thing in the truck
It's too big and it come with a strap
I got bitches, money, cars in a lot
I already got weed, bring cigars to the spot
Coke in a pot, 'gnac on the counter
Three money countless; get from around us
I probably won't do Yay' or 50 sales
Like they probably won't last in none of these jails
I'm tattooed up, Levi's double sewed Chuckers
No shirt, I'm back muh'fuckers!
The mac muh'fuckers don't clack muh'fuckers
That keep your lil' stink mouth intact muh'fuckers

Keep Me High,The Diamond Life Project,UnKnown," 
Keep, me high baby 
Ahhh, little bit

Smooth,
 Oh yeah you remember
'Bout the time I'm finished this blunt, I'm going to November
Kardashian money, running like Bruce Jenner (Running)
Shooting like Otium, blunts on the table telling models to roll up
Jars full of kush, n' every bottle is swollen
Half from Morocco, penthouse spot
I got cash on the top floor
Jordache slippers n' no laws
Chicks in bikinis you never could go wrong
I'm just trying to show you my cool side
So I'm blowing the zip pool side
Keep me high matter fact keep me too high
 

Keep me high, dutch lit, bamboo
If not I'm straight face like Ted Smooth
Vacation, no National Lampoon
Not Chevy Chase, I'm fetti chase
Blow a couple O's a day, I'm heavy weight
It's violet, listen love
Fuck me like a steward cause I'm high like a pilot
Red eyes, gremlins
Bar tabs Andre, 3000 Benjamin's
A hundred n' ten dutches
Eyes look chinky,
 I'm under the Louis Bucket
N' I know I'm stuck but I'm still saying fuck it

Manson Murder,Float,2013.0,"Believe me, if I started murdering people…
There’d be none of you left

Basically, hit you with the hard nigga recipe
Fuck you! If you ain’t with me, or next to me
(Fuck you!)
I ain’t one for the small talk
Ghost'll get it in like Nucky on Boardwalk
Real grimy nigga though, I'ma let the 4 talk
You ain’t got to hear me dog, you could hear the lord talk
Uzi up the place when the shotty blow the doors off
Dream of dollar bills and killin niggas that the kid hate
Nuttin' on yo bitch face, brain is in the sick place
Maybe it’s the wax or the fact that I’m shitfaced
Rap spelled backward is par – you ain’t up to that
If your shit sound wack I had enough of that
Fuck em all from the bottom to the top
If you left it up to me, yea all of 'em get shot
A bullseye on the forehead
Fuck wack rappers, leave em all dead

Why do you wanna call me a murderer for?
I’ve never killed anyone
I don’t need to kill anyone
I think it

Voices in the attic, bodies in the basement
People under the stairs hold my guns and chasin
When I buy a brick I bring a base head to taste it
Zombies out here, yea this shit is like a wasteland
I don’t give a fuck about no goddamn bath salts
P91 to blow half of your mass off
Face all over the asphalt
No track down here but whips is like NASCAR
Weed in the glass jar, shot em in the head ‘cause the trash words
Then I got ghosts like Casper
No, I get ghosts like myself
If I rap like you I put the toast to myself
I shit on you, the mic booth in your board
Why don’t you find a bridge and bungee with no chord
Or build yourself a pool full of swords
Dive in it, next time you rhyme put your mind in it

Maybe I should’ve killed 4 to 500 people
Then I would’ve felt better

The healthiest nigga in New York, smoking Newport’s
I’m not a new boos, I’m in the new Porsche
My Nike sneakers, it be my like sneakers
Jogging on the beach with my wife beaters
Word to Obama mama, Jeffrey Dahmer drama
Swiss got keys, pianos and Alicia
When I be talkin keys I’m talkin coke and the Keisha
I know chicks that swallow cum and they still suck it
Miscarriage hoes, fowl cuz they still fuckin
You know the deal, they don’t even wait to heal
My booster bitches – they can’t even wait to steal
My favorite sex position is the 69
I fuck er at 6 while holdin my 9
Amsterdam, stuff blunts, call em sumos
Walkin out the walk, with a veggie meal you know
Kick yo feet up like weed up, show yo speeder

I’m the king, man
I run the underworld, guy
I make the money, man
I change minds",https://genius.com/Styles-p-manson-murder-lyrics
I Don’t Give a Fuck,Ghost in the Shell,2004.0,"(Styles P)
Hustle hard just to keep these streets locked
Bitch, I'ma D-Block gangster, the one off Keith lock
Ryde or die nigga that'll let that heat pop
I go through walls, and y'all just shit rock
You don't want your head in a bandage
I'm gunnin for bread, you don't wanna be part of the sandwich
I'm eating niggas food, thought they harder than can bitch
OG shit stomp out their bandanas
Pressure bust pipes, niggas asked if they fam lived
Niggas don't give a fuck when they bustin them hammers
I don't care if you dolo or with your set
I just know your head is comin off with your neck
You can catch me smoking a bag and I don't throw signs
But if, niggas cross the line they gettin chocked with their flags
And the hood know I'm on some bullshit
You don't tempt P to wild out and empty out no full clip
Lock that strap, two guns up
In my black fatigue suit with my white sox hat
I kill your whole block bitch my life's like that
The hardest in New York cuz I'm nice like that
I use my knuckles to break jaws, the hawk'll put a
Hole in your torso and you know what the eigth's for
Headshots only
It's far from the flinstones but you better believe it's bed rock homie
I don't give a fuck never have never will
My only concern is how to live it up
I don't give a fuck, y'all could all get it so
If it's going down know that I ain't givin up
I don't give a fuck, that's how the hood is
Ask me what's good I say two guns up
I don't give a fuck, shitty ass attitude
Mad drunk and high, comin through yo what up
(Sheek Louch)
I don't stop til the casket drop
Moms is pop, face not showin like a number that's blocked
Unavailable, run in your crib
We the new york pirates of the fuckin caribb', motherfucka
The barrel 'bout as long as a flute
Left hand on my wrist, the impact make it bend when I shoot
So I get low, one binocular, like the opera
Bitch is gettin hit unless the nigga lay on top of her
Real talk, my bars and my flow
Is the sharpest thing next to a hawk, get a fault
Eat with your nigga
Don't compete with your nigga
'cause it's love til the heat hit you nigga
Feel me, same jeans on for ten days
My re-up is heavy, your stash bout as light as a pen weighs
If you don't want your side out
Just stay home, when the real niggas ride out, hide out
'cause if I'm involved with it
I ain't comin to scrap
I'm pullin up with my shit on my lap
And I don't mean hands together when I say I'ma clap
Don't be fools my guns can close down schools
With enough blood to fill up pools
Ayo P, who you want to lay down
I can see these lil niggas movin up, like a ultrasound
When it pull off, I spin em around that's for you
I don't give a fuck never have never will
My only concern is how to live it up
I don't give a fuck, y'all could all get it so
If it's going down know that I ain't givin up
I don't give a fuck, that's how the hood is
Ask me what's good I say two guns up
I don't give a fuck, shitty ass attitude
Mad drunk and high, comin through yo what up
(Jadakiss)
I seen it I did it I claimed
Dreamt about it and became it
One blue steel, one stainless
I'ma D-block provider, although I do play a big part as a ryder
All my bullets move around when they inside ya
And niggas been foul since the days of Elijah
Yeah, the coke is garbage, the prices is unreal
Feds hittin niggas with flat bids for gun sales
It ain't a game neither, they givin RICO to the gang leaders
Tell you the truth to hit a bank sweeter
I got it mapped out
I got the game in a choke hold and I ain't lettin go til y'all tap out
And this here, is a bonus rap
Niggas is wired but everybody phone is tapped
Every word that come out your face will come out in the case
Slow a lotta niggas down, get 'em out of the race
It's either hold water or you holdin' a quarter
Takin' a chance, of never again holdin your daughter
Least you could do is send 'em a kite
Since it's Ramadan I only kill niggas at night
Either the barrel of the gun or the tip of the knife
Go head and beg for your life
So I can hurry up and ship you to Christ
Devoted, committed, by any means necessary
Do whatever for me and my niggas to get it
I don't give a fuck never have never will
My only concern is how to live it up
I don't give a fuck, y'all could all get it so
If it's going down know that I ain't givin up

You can get it for the low you know the right people
The day times cool but the nights evil
Dream weed, white coke and white diesel

We coulda went to war but johnny had a heart
Yea we coulda built but johnny had it smarts
Be a wise man or a live man
If you can expand then expand your time spend
You dont get the picture get a live cam
Rather hear a money machine than a nine blam
Yea ghost wild but im cooled out
Neighbors with the rich folks and I ain't trying to move out
Cause im only trying to move up
No aim from crack packs on the tool bus
Dope bags in the union cab
I ain't just rappin you salute if you knew the half
Youll recognize my stride if you knew the path
Youll recognize my pride if you knew the wrath

Look at me, you can see me smile when the kickback
Before rap, ask where my gun and my clip at
Got my hands on it, then I ask where the strip at
Niggas got coke, then I ask where the bricks at
Next rapper that lies, the next rapper I'll click at
Bullet holes in your Louis clothes
Get wrapped the fuck up like a sushi roll
Soft niggas get wet like the coochie hole
Cootie nigga put my gun on goofy though

Or your guts dropped
You a goner, I'ma G that can play any corner like the bus stop
Fuck around and get your slug popped
Had a bitch on the floor like a dust mop
Still gettin' money in the dusk spot
Cut you in the face with the blade we use to cut rock

I can't stand the rain or the pain
Nigga sippin' on drain for flippin' cocaine
But you smile when you smokin' and you whippin' all lanes
Sippin' champagne and you trickin' on dames
When you go to Hell, are you sittin' on flames?
Type of shit I think about sittin' on planes
First class, if I crash, shit'll all change
All I do is get high 'cause shit is all strange

Paddle shift cool but I'd rather play with the clutch
Silence is golden, never sing it enough
My mama told me to shoosh
No tellin' and no tellin' what I'm doin' to crooks
What I'm doin' with books is getting information, yeah
Call the cleaner, fix the situation, yeah
When I rhyme its like a dissertation
Whether its vocal or verbal, the hood hoppin' the hurdles
Shit hurt your heart when your homie is tryna' burn you
Puttin' in work, the sweat soaked in your thermal
Give people my pain, never wrote in a journal
Maybe I outta do it, but maybe I'm talkin' through it
Every line when I rhyme, my nigga, recorder to it
Truth

Game is fact with some fiction in it
Slang with some diction in it
Peaceful, but I hurt you, does that make me a hypocrite?
Liquor, pour a fifth of it
Leaf, roll a splif of it
Always act the same, but I'm always on some different shit

Cash to Burn (Reference),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Change if you can do without the things I can't get you
Mink coats, diamond rings and cash for you to burn
The kind of stuff you earn

40 acres and a mule, somebody's a fool
20 brothers with Bugattis could've went and bought a school
Here we like jewels, diamonds, reefers and booze
Got cash for my boo, she can buy some new boobs
Life is a heffa, I order travel to Mecca
In the Tesla that can fly while I visit my ancestors
Something that I can buy, help out the Chi'
Stop the gun shots, I will somersault to the sky
Ride to the heaven with Teddy, Riley and Guy
Jim in the chariot, pain, I had to carry it
You ain't treated yet but you're still wearing your lazarus
Cash for you to burn, but I swear to you, its hazardous

All you do is party, you just lookin' for somebody
With some (
Cash for you to burn, the kind of stuff you earn
)
All that ass don't hurt nobody
Me and all my posse, we brought (
Cash for you to burn, the kind of stuff you earn
)

Visionary, like Webster making the dictionary
Niggas go to church but they never part of the missionary
Time to tell the truth, I'm good times painted in the flesh
And Mona Lisa was seduced
Mike Jack had the glove, I got the kicks and the boots
Yeah, I'm sorry for the hat, I was a tad bit confused
Making Africans great, then I'm throwing up the deuce
But still got love for the whites and the Jews
Anybody that's any color, love is the move
Love is the new cash like Teyana said
Like a virgil, like a prayer, live to tell like Madonna said
And always do good like your momma said

All you do is party, you just lookin' for somebody
With some (
Cash for you to burn, the kind of stuff you earn
)
All that ass don't hurt nobody
Me and all my posse, we brought (
Cash for you to burn, the kind of stuff you earn

Find that peaceful place
Tryna relax, you know?
Grow old on some cool stoner, smokin', vibed out shit, ya dig?

Wasn't expected to be shit
I came up rough, I expected to be slick
I came up poor, I expected to be rich
Joke's on you for neglectin' this G shit
My Pops died, left his all for me
I asked God, ""Hold my daughter for me""
Feel my pain, light a quarter for me
Money's cool but respect's more important for me
Goin' through it with trust issues
Loved by all, I got me enough issues
Questin' for peace but I be on the streets thinkin'
I ain't got me enough pistols
Watchin' my back but I'm sayin' the fuck wit'chu?
I'm already in the mix
If they want a nigga dead, I'm already on the list
Kickin' through the mud, I been holdin' steady in this shit
If I got the plug, never actin' petty with this shit
Throw me in the whip, I am like Andretti on the stick
This the fast life but I hit the brakes
Threw it in neutral, I'm tryna get in place
'Cause niggas'll shoot you right up in your face
I pass you a joint knowin' the shit is laced

Life's a bitch, who am I to complain?
If it's joy, then there gotta be pain
If it's sun, then there gotta be rain
Life's a bitch, try to hit it like the lottery game

I'm just lookin' to find my happy place
When you a die a couple niggas'll give you accolades
Activate my chi to evacuate
Meditate, smoke one, break down, evaporate
Momma told me she loved me but God love me more
Sleep and ask the Heavens, what could God love me for?
Told to deal with my demons, I did it all wrong
Served myself a little weed, yeah, it was hard bein' poor
Please excuse me for not actin' Godly before
My rapport mean a lot to me, my armies adored
May my seed be blessed and the sea be blessed
And this weed be blessed from my ominous force

Bruise from your ear to your mustache
Fuck around, nigga you'll be swallowin' crushed glass
Back on my hard shit, back on my yard shit
Back on my scarred shit
Thirty sets a day still hatin' the bar shit
Nice with a hawk like a Navy Seal, who is the target?
Make the walls look likes it's red paint, red rug
Need a little love, nigga get you a lead hug
My bullets gon' frap, gun in my backpack
Fuck all the chit chat, my shit got kicked back

Still knock the one shotgun to his anus
Then to his kneecap, then to his shoulder
Soldier, should of read my file or folder
I'm colder than Antarctica or Alaska
The blaster, you don't need a rocket I'll get you to NASA
I told you ain't nobody nicer, 
fuck with the shyster
You gettin' sliced up
I ain't finished yet, this only my start up
Catch him outside then I'm shootin' his car up
Tell him sayonara there's no more tomorrow
No more today now, go 'head lay down

Black hoodie, black panther
Huey Newton, I'm radical

Diamonds on my wrist-piece

In front or back of the track
And from the back of the trap, we forever clappin' the Mac

I done bagged up in the spot
I done ran when it got hot
I done slept on that cot
Been gettin' money, imagine what I'm bout to do
You a bitch, name a hood that'll vouch for you
Get popped up, find yo ass chopped in two
Let's go!

I'd rather be a have than a have-not
But there's a lot of shit that I'd rather not have
Drama, bein' a nigga that the shot blast
Hustlin', bein' a nigga that the cop pass
Smokin', sayin' to myself, ""this will not last""
Lookin' at a bottle of pills, 'bout to pop half
I put a bullet in your body, yeah, the top half
You's a funny-ass nigga, I did not laugh

Bloodshed, tears fall
Fuck the hero, it's the villain that we cheer for
Family, money, and weed, the things that I care for
 is a war, that I'm prepared for
Cold heart, black soul
I ain't got to be drunk to wild and let the gat go
Lyrically I'm on a whole 'nother plateau
Talkin' to the holy ghost, but we ain't in the chapel

Holdin' a nickel-plate, killin', is not difficult

I’m on my Balkin joint flow you know

If you ballin then pass the ball off
I promise to God that even the angel falls off
I might be in tune with the sun and the moon
But I ain’t slipping on some shit like ain’t a gun in the room
Probably burning some frankincense
Gritty version of Frankenstein
Rockers didn’t make me
The streets did
I made the grind
I’m probably reciting Jada lines
Newish lines, Jet star blade in ma gooseline
Sitting on the balcony
Lounging at the Ritz
Guerilla nigga
I can hear the sounds in the mist
Tell em consigliere leave the burner wid consierge
Take from under the stairs cause niggas taking the

And the cussing Columbians just looking to buy a bank

Constrainin the stank that’s leaving my mind blank

Prayers through the best
Drinks in the system
Smoke in the air for the stress

Live through the worst
Prayers through the best
Drinks in the system
Smoke in the air for the stress

Prayers for the homies in the box to the day of death
Salute to the hungry, we going eat we just gotta rep

Hungry
Reppin for real niggas that never eat
Living in Hell’s Kitchen praying to get to heaven’s gate
They say Death is part of the four horsemen
With Famine, Conquest and War in small coffins
I ain’t even  but yea bread needs endorsements
I know I swear to God I’d kill a nigga through 
You other niggas praying that it works out
That’s real crazy cause a jail cell is the worse hell
Back on delivery
Mar bars sharpen up the cars
Sharpen up industry
Running from Yonkers where niggas think its the Middle East
How you going kill that nigga you went to Little League
OG’s is diggin it
Yeah, and the young boys too
They say fuck that the flip is what the gun boys do
I know that cause I’ve been one
Put a nigga out when you ain’t like doing the income
Pray when the end come

Won't be the first cocksucker that wanna murder me
Whip engineer down in Germany
Outside's green but the inside’s burgundy
Life ain’t promised but nigga death is a certainty
Bubbling and struggling, yea like the purp with me
And get faded, no hair cut
Elevators broke them niggas and take the stairs up
I’m real, you ain’t nigga so don’t compare us
You the type of nigga I tears up
Just like a tissue
So killing you ain’t no issue
Get stripes in the whistle and you still ain’t official

Your clique be like yellow lights, I’m runnin through y'all

Dance with the devil, I bet you you’ll pay the price
Couple niggas die and a couple will get life
Couple niggas change when they get to see the light
Couple get a second chance and do the same shit twice
Doing wrong shit, but I can do it right
That’s the life, you don’t know what I could welcome you tonight
Get a light, sit back, nigga welcome to the flights
Where the G's fly high, these ride by and you try to bring em low
Me, I’m getting singin' dope out of Singapore
You don’t like that? Nigga middle finger though
These niggas won’t match but I bet you they clingers do
Yap to yo face but the battle swingin low
These first teeth next, you don’t want beef yet
Getting money nigga so I don’t make cheap threats
The tray pound is the big three and you ain’t see the Heat yet

Takin flicks of a man getting hit by a train
No way, too many people that are rich will complain
While the homeless sing in the rain, living off change
Other countries claim that heroes suicidal
Over here it’s strange, fake killas become idols
Don’t believe in gangsta? Let’s swear on the bible
Keep the enemy close, now yo best friend yo rival
Tryna be honest in a land full of crooks
Whatever you G you're right so go hand you the book
Mom cryin up in court while you can’t even look
Can’t compare to the moms and the kids of Sandy Hook
And who’s written and I wanna know who wrote it
This is the rat race, now we all nothing but rollers
Tryna find the snakes of the grass, I gotta smoke it
Now lookin' for the drama, but still waitin' for my moment

Stop fooling with these folks who haven’t been through anything
You are not going to get a flow from people who have not been crushed
The real flow of glory will always come from somebody who’s been crushed
There will be a flow from out of him like you have never seen before
It’s beyond anything you have ever seen before

I'mma still be here when the lights is on
Got a fat ass in front of me, Dutch in my mouth
Wit a Corona in my left hand
You try to front I'll coma your best man
I keep a trick up my sleeve, more like a two fifth up my sleeve
Then I switch it to the trey-deuce
In my back pocket, so me and love can stay loose
It's like thugs ain't partyin', I smoke 20 dimes
I seen 20 dimes I love they body and
P tryin' to score for the night
And to tell you the truth, my shit blown if we war for the night

We gon' drink til we drunk, dance til we drop
And ain't nobody leavin til the music stop

Can I get a Soul Clap 

Ayo shit is still gravy though
I keep a open case, the block hot I need a song for the radio
P at the club, niggas scared to let they lady go
Foot Locker 4 for 20's
Coulda had her some jeans, Nike Airs, I keep all my money
Still slide out the club wit a gorgeous honey
I don't care if it's a hole in the wall, I feel comfortable
Violate P, that's a hole in your jaw
All I want is cranberry and Courvoisier
I'm trying to talk to a dime
Motherfucker, but I still take the time
Cocksucker, to rob y'all niggas for y'all Cardiers

And a gun wit a silencer, why cuz they hardly hear

Wit a cool ass bomb like Bob Marley there

Rather get a Soul Clap than clap your soul
Honey askin' how many blunts I have to roll
I'mma smoke til I'm high, drink til I'm drunk
I'm on my tour, shit and I ain't get a wink in a month
My favorite color is green
But I'm stacked for the moment so I'mma pick pink for the month
If you could take a hint, then after this party
If you want, hop in the Viper limo with the tints
Got the fifty Cal, so hold that
Tell 'em roll back
I show niggas the real meaning of Soul Clap

Of black cops killing white kids

Where's the living room?

Give me some racist crackers and just sit 'em down
Let me tell 'em some shit, that they ain't figured out
You're little white son, in his room playin' hip hop loud
That's my nigga man
Yeah I said it, he a nigga too
You wanna kill me? You should kill him too
If this is God's house, where's the living room?
I'm strapped and I see a white cop
Should I give it to him?
Like fuck it, I'm the enemy
You wanna kill me and my seeds, that's the energy

Better start remembering, the fist keep 'em tremblin'


I swear to God with my right hand
Most of the racists are scared of the white man
Cause they'll take a foreign land and make it a white land

Yeah I'm thankful, but shit is feeling hard everyday
Some are more fortunate, some are less

I ain't lying look at the clock, the time is never stuck

Need to slow down, but the fast life's such a rush
Crying blood and I'm pissing 'gnac
Money come and go, but love ones you don't get 'em back
Just see 'em on the other side

Is the tank full 'cause the bank full?

I just go hard in the paint, I ain't hesitate
I ain't like the way shit was goin', found a better way
Ghost back, maybe I ain't leave, I just played the cut
Dose pack, lit it, got high, went and made a buck

Nobody should kill, nobody should die
Nobody's nobody, somebody rise

I was on the corners but I wasn't getting cornered in
I was thinking business even standing there and loitering
I was thinking enterprise, car rental, Enterprise
Hima in it, big bag of smoke and a dinner pie
Call me ghost, really not the one to identify
I'm about peace, pull this nine though, ten'll fly

Men lie, women lie, numbers don't
Men die, women die, numbers don't
What you think I'm tryna hit my number for?
I said what you think I'm tryna hit my number for?
Men lie, women lie, numbers don't
Men die, women die, numbers don't
What you think I'm tryna hit my number for?
I said what you think I'm tryna hit my number for?",https://genius.com/Styles-p-numbers-dont-lie-lyrics
Bad Man,PRESENCE,2019.0,"You don't know what it is to be a mad man
Nor a bad man

Bad man live, bad man die
Mad man laugh, mad man cry
I'm from the place where the bad man ride
Light up a spliff, I get the mad man high
Bad man live, bad man die
Mad man laugh, mad man cry
I'm from the place where the bad man ride
Light up a spliff, I get the mad man high

Bad man live, bad man die
Cuttin' grams over handguns, a bad man's life
Life is a bitch, that's a bad man's wife
Have you ever walked a mile in a bad man's Nikes?
Mask on, turnin' off the Caravan lights
And we ain't speakin' Arab but we Taliban-like
That work ain't a record, it ain't gotta scan right
Yeah, we take over the town, we just gotta plan right
A mad man laugh when he make a lot of cash
You ever crossed the line then you gotta feel the wrath
We ever go to war then I gotta take a bath
All in your blood and your members of your staff
I told you that I'm mad and I told you that I'm bad
Now I'm tryna get a bag while I'm rippin' on the dab
Whippin' in the Jag had me rippin' up your flag
'Cause you crossed the wrong nigga now you gotta get tagged

Bad man live, bad man die
Mad man laugh, mad man cry
I'm from the place where the bad man ride
Light up a spliff, I get the mad man high
Bad man live, bad man die
Mad man laugh, mad man cry
I'm from the place where the bad man ride
Light up a spliff, I get the mad man high

You don't wanna play with a mad man
I told the Devil fuck 'em, he could save me the last dance
Soul on fire, you should try to check out the CAT scan
Same pain as Bane when he breakin' the Batman
We the initiated
Should have anticipated I'm wicked
Got the demons even sayin' they sick of David
Kiss the pavement or the ring when I come around
Too smart to dumb it down
I shoot and you run around you fuck niggas
They ain't tell you that I'm madder than the scientist who made Frankenstein?
Just to be frank, I'll get you lined
You don't see what I'm sayin' then hear what I'm sayin'
Fuck nigga, I will get you blind (Fuck nigga)
I feel bad 'cause I'm feelin' good (Feelin' good)
But I'm in the hood and all I see is wicked times (That's all I see)
It's a lot of emcees
You ask me, I say, ""Fuck 'em all
None of 'em got sicker rhymes""

Bad man live, bad man die
Mad man laugh, mad man cry
I'm from the place where the bad man ride

I know that you pussy
Cause you ain't the same if police is around nigga
I know that you pussy - I know that you pussy
Cause you ain't the same if police is around nigga
Listen my niggas, I ain't with all that riffin my niggas
Load 9 bullets and hit you, have you shittin my niggas
Niggas bodies out New York but they lettin they mouths ride
Been a long time since y'all been on the South side
Y'all niggas wanna count what we got, y'all niggas industry
Cornball I get most my shit from the block
But it's funny I can switch up my watch, plus switch up my car
Got a house in a real cool spot
But you never gon' see me on ""Cribs""
I'm a criminal, can't let them grimy niggas see where I live
Cause they might kick in the door, lookin for the piff and the raw
But all they gon' get's the fifth and the four
""All Eyez on Me"" like Mr. Shakur
Knockin the Whispers in the Cadillac, sit on velour
I adapt to my habitat, give me a four
With a fully loaded clip, a bitch that drive stick
That can roll a thai stick, definitely on some high shit
Ma I'm 'bout to cut up this Yayo
Bring 50 to the Bank then Buck at these a-holes
But, I don't wanna blam they click
They don't stand a chance and I'mma come cleaner like the dance to this shit
Them niggas aight, but tell Yayo to vamoose
Let me set you, check you, 50 don't respect you
On the radio he said your baby mom was a Deuce
I was sittin on the bunk like damn he a punk
Don't make me off niggas y'all snitches is soft niggas
What? I'm just fuckin around wit y'all niggas
I ain't tryin to catch a case
I know that you pussy, police is wit'chu
Security or somethin, I ain't gon' risk it my niggas
Case you ever fell jumpy leave the cops at home though

Other Side,Phantom and the Ghost,2014.0,"I love my motherfucking brothers, my word

If you feel right at the bottom
Your homie got killed and you praying God got him (pray for him)
Wishing you could shoot who shot him
You see them in the zone just know that the pack got em
Smile at the good look forward to the better times
Weed up there, look forward to getting heaven high
Peace sign to the sky, we’ll forever ride
See you on the other side, knowing it’s the better side (I see you)
I'll be down here lightin' pot
For niggas that got life and niggas that got shot
Niggas that rap nice but niggas would not pop
They never got signed but niggas did not stop (they didn’t)
It's pain in the vocals, more in the dubs and the ad libs
If you know where the path is
Road to perdition, the ride die
Nigga jump start the ignition and you done your trippin
Yeah

Praying for my niggas on the other side
Represent your memory 'til the day I die
I'm trying to make it through the hard times
No matter what you're going through
You know you got to fight, fight

Now you're down and you’re out cause you broke
And the motherfuckin' bills do you wanna merk somethin
Yeah, I feel you (I feel you)
But don't let that stress kill you
Light it, come up with a plan to make em feel you (come on wid a plan)
You can be broke, but not broke down (don’t break down)
There's a faith for your life and it's a close round
Ran to faith hold hope down, hope hold faith down tryin' to get it straight now (I’m tryin)
Let God, Imma need to say more, pray more, know I got sins I got to pay for (I know)
What you think I’d be lighting up the Jays for
I got a lot but I seem to want way more (I want way more
Struggle to make you stronger
So I keep the hunger just to last a little longer
That's why I stay reppin for the corners
Promise to keep it G, 'til the day I'm goner


When you die, you wanna said you ate with your niggas
Basically saying break down your plates, you niggas
Or at least smoked an 8th with your niggas
You don’t smoke, then you should drink a case with your niggas
Tomorrow ain’t promised
Tryna make the best of today tho (try)
As long as you're breathing, you're okay though (you’re ok)
Light up the blunts get some more smoke
This is for the dead and alive and all the poor folk
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You gotta fight

So Deep,Phantom and the Ghost,2014.0,"Exhale and ventilate
If you can't build and destroy then you renovate
Thoughts that innovate, blinding on the interstate
Back with the Devil when me and Death had a dinner date
Yeah, I'm a cynic but I don't know how the venom taste
Snake ain't I me, wolf is
Chip on my shoulder, another one where the tooth is
If I'm in the building then I'm probably where the roof is
Wonder it the angels' music is acoustic
Cause mine is electric
The depth of my soul can't be measure by the metric
Raised where it's hectic, black magic
And the flow is majestic
Magician on the tarot card
Ask myself can I disappear from Babylon
Been this and that, I could breathe in a store
Make the mannequins rap, what up

It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink

All my niggas going to war
I'm a go first, ask the guy where should I look
On a soul search, can't cross the bridge unless I pay the toll first
Can't make the point unless I score the goal first
Pull that sour kush, I don't roll dirt
Niggas will clap but you gotta give 'em a show first
Niggas is acting, improve your improv
The ride ain't pretty cause the life ain't no rim job
You gonna break down, the down breaks
Standing on shaky ground or you make the ground shake
Niggas will merk you for a pound cake
And then cry about it, down state
Till I blow ain't a nigga in the town safe
Outside pitching until the motherfucking mountain break
Don't you ever cop no ground weight
Lean on the white work, nigga, that's life work

It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink

In here for the insight, flow Gs, probably an OZ in my windpipes
Cloud of smoke on my frontal lobe
Told my niggas my vision is still tunnel, though
I could see the light at the end
I wonder why you know it's a mic at the end
In the audience still, I dream an end, tryna make about 40 a year

It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink
It's like I make niggas shiver and think
I'm so deep that if water tried to listen then the rivers would sink",https://genius.com/Styles-p-so-deep-lyrics

So I'm coolin', my nigga
That money movin', my nigga
Out in the jungle, it's hyenas and lions
And gorillas and snakes and all that other shit

But I load up my hammer for all that other shit

I light up two joints then a few joints
Turn the beat on just to prove a few points (A few)
Show 'em to the plug, get a few points (Hahaha)
A crew full of animals, a zoo, what do you do for 'em? (What do you do for 'em?)
Do you get 'em tamed or you leave 'em wild? (Huh?)
I'm infestin', I invested in my own style
Know I stay reppin' the hood (D-Block)
You ain't familiar with my neck of the woods (No)
You should check if you good (Check)
But if you check with a loc that's broke, what is the word worth? (What's that worth?)
Talkin' to the plug, what the bird worth? (How much is that?)
You tryna go straight, who you curve first?
Fuckin' right I'm a gangster, homie, but I'm a nerd first (Nerds)
Smart enough to read up on the art of war
Time is valuable, it's deeper than the Audemar (It's deeper)
Patek or Hublot, if you blow and you ain't on that shit (On that shit)
Then they might bust a TEC at your two-door

Out in the jungle, it's hyenas and lions

So I'm coolin', my nigga

If things get messy, know I'm Pesci with it
Billy the Kid, Jimmy Conway or Jesse with it (Woo)
I'm talkin' James
Let that .44 flame on the train for a bag
If he mad, you can bet he get it (You can bet he get it)
Been in a high-speed chase, drivin' steady with it
I've been rich, I've been poor, so I'm petty with it (I'm petty)
Fuck the karma, all I need is marijuana for the trauma
That's the suicide bomber that's cool as the Dalai Lama
Kids see Ghost, I ain't Ye, I ain't Cudi
But the .45's my buddy for all of the side drama (All of that)
Fuckin' with the scariest, you can Hail Mary
I'm probably plottin' like Tyrion (I'm plottin'), Lannister
They gon' need a janitor, there's matter on the banister
He ain't have the stamina
Hammer in my canister
Got it out the kitchen (Got it)
You won't catch me slippin' (Uh-uh)
'Cause the Ghost got the sauce and you know it's still drippin'

When I die, I wanna go where the angels sleep

They in-route too, niggers'll shoot you, it's crucial
Ain't Marley Marl but I'm part of the new Juice Crew
Brass in the bark of the dutch in the deuce deuce
Spit on a nuke to get loot, I'm the shit, dude

Give 'em a inch and them niggas'll take a mile on you
Father they style and them niggas'll try to Style on you
But not me nigga, Amma Cafie nigga, can't pop me nigga
I always come with a good plan
And if that don't work, I switch out to the hood plan

Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep
Even though the streets full of heat
Still I gotta make ends meet
Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep
I pray that my soul you keep
'Cause me wa fi to dwell where the angel's sleep

God is protection, X is intersections
Trunk full of weight in the Chevy, holding the Wesson
Fire will burn but we never would learn a lesson
'Til the cell door close, move more keys
And we sell more O's and bag more grams
We ain't wanna be criminals, we had more plans
But it ain't pan out
It's rocks in this pot that I gotta hand out as soon as they fan out
That's the old days, these the new days
Now it's Salvia, kush, lemon and Poo day
High def, Wi-Fi, clear as Blu-ray
But I'm still old school like the hangin' antenna
You could play with the fam or bang your bandana
S-P the Ghost or S-P the most
Lyrical motherfucka in the game, no jokes
.45 will leave your ass high, no smoke

Jah be like a long cloth to my feet
Guide and protect me when things get deep

Pocket full of weed
Rain full of thoughts and I'm followin' the path with no one in the lead
Things that I see, yeah, no one would believe
As an emcee care about no one in the league
Besides my two brothers, yeah, all of y'all could bleed
If you test me, trust me, none of y'all will leave
I am life force, I am death force
More than a Skywalker, I am on the next course
Whoever's the king shoulda stepped off
I am the God to cut your breath off
Have you ever been to Heaven for your best thoughts?
Or dragged through Hell to get your stress off?
I have, so you can't bypass my next course
Do as I say, don't do as I do
To my son and the Crips and even Piru
Seen a lotta hard niggas and I seen 'em die too

Holiday back, the difference is I ain't got a buncha crack in the whip
Go ahead run, I will let the 'blagh' at your hip

I dip in the whip, fully equipped
Light a zip then another one, all of my niggas get ripped
Speakin' of ripped, thinkin' you cheap
Heard your music, think it was weak
You think a rapper better, I hope you thinkin' of Sheek
Or hope you thinkin' of Kiss
If not, then I tell you, ""fuck you, I hope you eatin' a dick""
I load the hammer up and have you eatin' the fifth

Switch My Style,Ghost in the Shell,2005,"G-H-O-S-T
Give me a G-U-N
And some S-M-O-K-E
I'm on the B-L-O-C-K
With a G-L-O-C-K
With my bad bitch, and she came from BK
Heard about the work, and they ran and told the D.A
D.A. told the feds how I had it out in VA
Now I'm on the L-O-W
It's fucked up because all I tried to do was be L-O-W
Hate them R-A-T's
Give me a M-A-C
I'll make them motherfuckers RIP
I'm in the H Double-O-D
It's G Double-O-D
I ain't a B or a C
But you could believe I'm a OG
A W Double-E-D in the O-Z
760LI and I'm low key

I'mma let the heat pop

Gots to switch my style
A lot of niggas biting it
They shit sound like mine
I might as well be writing it
Gots to switch my style
A lot of niggas licking cock
Fronting like the ghost
But them niggas wouldn't lick a shot
Gots to switch my style
It's a 1,000 little me's
Only thing, I'm majorin
And them motherfuckers little league

So I'mma play the backseat ride in the middle
On my Justin Timberlake shit, cry me a river
But niggas need they throats cut, slide me the scissors
No dare touchin us
And niggas call me Glade
Because if I don't get paid
I spray like air fresheners
A lot of niggas sound like I
They don't get down like I
I got the urge to treypound that eye
From the 1st to the 3rd
I can give you my word
We got birds, not the type that fly around in the sky
And I'm just trying to get in my place
Do my thing, while you trying to be king
I'm steady shooting for ace
And my hoodie stay on, and the boots is laced
You violate, you couldn't take what I'd do to your face

I'm from 354 with a 9 mm
On my 38 waist in a 55 Benz
Get it for 17, sell it for 28
If the money ain't straight, they gunnin the .38's
It's 17 up in my Glock. 4 dutches a box
4 different drugs they sell in the spot
And 911 mean they calling the cops
We get the 411 from the fiend off the block
I got a spot where it's 40 a bag
Niggas old school, still drink 40's
Keep stows and their rags
Bust off the .40 cal. soon as I point at the fag
So it cost P nothin just to 1 your ass",https://genius.com/Styles-p-switch-my-style-lyrics
Gotta Know,PRESENCE,2019.0,"I just wanna talk to you
Sometimes I just wanna talk
Just want you to hear me out
Shit like that, you know

If I'm gonna die in the morning, who give the warning to me?
Who? I bet it wouldn't be the reaper, homie (I bet that)
And you know I love rhyming to you (Hahaha)
But this shit is getting deeper, homie
I used to hustle for that sneaker money, working the speaker
Then the crib turned to Sneaker Dome (Sneaker's heavyweight, nigga)
But I should've thought of buildings below Orleans
I'm still building, why you think I'm seeking for 'em?
And I should've  geek
But the handgun was sleek and my palm no reach
(Don't you fuckin' move)
Middle of a robbery, louder shit would bother me
But wasn't used to speakin' on it (I ain't speakin' on  God)
In the hood, it's aggressive shit, I ain't really stressin' shit
I just light the reefer for it
But then I had to change it
Face all my fears, but I didn't get weaker for it

Gotta know your weakness, gotta know your strength
Are you built for the war? Can you go the length?
Hopped off the stoop, climbed every fence
Stayed on the grind, shine ever since
Gotta know your weakness, gotta know your strength
Are you built for the war? Can you go the length?
Hopped off the stoop, climbed every fence
Stayed on the grind, shine ever since

Tears stain the face and blood stains the body
And drugs stain the  and dirt stains the stoop
So none of us is clean but all we want is green
So all of us will rule (We ruling)
It's fucked up, on the drive (Fucked up)
Knowing some of us could die and some of us could blow
It's a rollercoaster ride, no amusement in the park
When you runnin' from the narcs, gun'll spark and you could go
To the pearly gates in Heaven or the flames down in Hell
But you ain't live to tell, so we don't really know
The show will go on and the flow will go on
Just like that in the slums, but you already know that
They don't give a fuck about 'em so, or the fuck about us 
Why you think they give a fuck about you?
But he don't give a fuck, so I don't give a fuck
In a room with some niggas, they don't give a fuck, too

Gotta know your weakness, gotta know your strength
Are you built for the war? Can you go the length?
Hopped off the stoop, climbed every fence
Stayed on the grind, shine ever since

I'll lay a nigga down and send his moms a bouquet for free
I could start a pet store with these birds
I'm the rap Donald Goines with words
Still rob y'all herbs (And I came to)
Hit the club on my dick, light up a blunt
Thug a bitch out, I got the mud in the front
I got the flight jacket, came with wings
When I chase you to the roof
Clappin' at ya ass with one of them things

I’m in the streets where the soldiers stay
You can talk about getting fresh with people where they close for days
You can roll in a nice whip, we be rolling haze
Maintained in the game, and I’m so amazed
Only Jews that we got was advice
From the brothers that been through it
But I can ask my mother she’s been through it
Back home in Africa where the struggle is real
I can say my blood line is spectacular
But it’s a sin and I don’t know my kin
I’m a ghost don’t know my beginning know my end
Yo Konvict calm my soul pray that I live
& I hope the lord forgive me for all of my sins
Chorus

Saw my life I could fight like a solider
Hustling was another mode a
That I can use to survive
Even though they said it ain’t right
So tell me where were you when those nights got colder
The day I thought that it was all over
As you can see I survived
Made the best of my life...
Verse 2

I’m a man so I shed tears
For my homies in the jail and my dead peers
Lot of blood dropped the police the red years
Don’t show, cold sores, so the feds here
A lot of gangsters in my town like the Greb there
Outside all night cause it’s red there
Want to beef, forget invest, get headgear
This is the town where you get down
And drown nobody tread here
I swear to god that I’m telling the truth
Was a felon when I fell in the booth
They want me to feel
Like I was feeling I was scared of the truth
Yo Kon turn me up so I can give them the proof
Chorus
Verse 3

I said I’m man enough to cry
I ought to let you know that I ‘m man enough to die
War for the cause when I do
21 salute, can into the sky
Have it for the drought when the grams gon’ get high
My friends are saying your man gon’ get high
Slide in the five just to gon’ get a buy
Sixth gear, 200 trying to die on the ride

Struggling hard and it's a hassle CHILDREN
Gotta teach them how to survive and win, the whole future of the world depends on CHILDREN
So I talk wise and speak clearly, but still sometimes they don't here me  CHILDREN
When I open my heart I catch feeling, cause the kids need hope they need healing CHILDREN

My love's like a jungle, hop around like some chimps
Or we can do the thang 'til the stick go limp

I'm in the white tee gang and I'm a Yankee head
This my sophomore solo album
I'mma take a lot of shots and not for no photo album
Come through in the Polo outfit
Ryde or Die, two guns up, who I roll out with
Keep talkin to me you gon' end up spouseless
Keep hearin you're jackassin who you out with


Tell your man he can meet the pump
I'm at the double-oh suites of Trump, for at least a month
Got a whole lot of liquor and some reefer blunts
I'm on the laid back tip, I don't need to front
Tell your man he don't want no problems
Better let him know that I'm hard like J.E. album
I'm just tryin to fall back, get me some revenue
But I'mma make you feel like you walked out of heaven too
Ride like the down South Caddies, listen
He might be yo' man, but I'm yo' daddy
Call me from the back cause you want me badly
Ask me to scoop you and I do that gladly

Why you kick it like that, girl
Callin me from the back, and

Why you lookin so sad, babe
Always gettin mad at me

You can say she's sorta like my Wednesday lover
We in the Benz if he find out he probably plug us
I don't wanna ride on him, just came home
Matter of fact I'm tryin to hide on him, get in that dome
She wanna call from the back, knowin I don't know how to act
I don't got a problem blowin the mac
But I'd rather play the bed with her legs in the vertical
Knockin Jagged Edge, Porsche Turbo convertible
We can leave New York, skip to the A-Town
Five star suite, hit me off with the hay now
I'm just tryin to stay low, ma you feel me?
I don't need no jealous dudes tryin to peel me

Trying writing a movie, trying writing a book
But even all alone I spend my night with a crook
Try to overstand, try to overlook
Remember how a pig and a rat had a colder look
I'm spiritual, I don't read Jehova's book
Or Allah's book, or God's book
Just a man and it's easy not a hard look
I don't't trust you, so don't trust me
Bullets shiny, blades rusty
Fuck with me, Fuck you that's how it must be
This is D-Block, This is L.O.X
Yeah I'm saying goodbye but I ain't said hello yet",https://genius.com/Styles-p-street-life-lyrics

Time I testify, listen
Why Malcolm get killed by the N.O.I.?
I'm yellow but I'm dark for real
And why nobody flip when Martin was killed?
Why Mandela did all them years
All that blood, all that sweat, and all them tears?
And I can name thousands more
That died in the struggle from Mr. Wallace to Mr. Shakur
That's why I stay influenced to ""Kick in the Door""
Bring the White House dudes around the blacks that's poor
Notice that it's ""unity"" in ""opportunity""
Make a lil' cash, now the block is screwin' me
Brand new E-Class, cops pursuin' me
Guess they wanna see me park it
Lookin at my gun, they wanna see me spark it
But I'm the Ghost and if I could vote it would be for Sharpton
Yeah!

Yeah, yo, yo
We never stop like the news watch
Still trying to fill the void of Biggie and 2Pac
We on them avenues with the red and the blue tops
Dudes hot to shoot cops from the rooftops
Too many snitch niggas TESTIFY
Warrior kings sent to the bing and left to die
Girls confuse sex with love so they extra dry
And got birth control stuck to they necks and thigh
Whoa, it ain't a game, they want the blacks all killed off
Our caps all peeled off, nigga this real talk
What's ill is y'all niggas still caught up in them battle raps
There's beef in the hood, Escaladin' like Cadillacs
Monkey on your back livin like a junkie
Addicted to a dream, wanna die for your country
Tear down the prison walls, set everyone free
From freedom fighters to Askari X to Pimp C


Yeah... kids slip in the clip and aim
For the fortune cause the fame ain't shit to gain
They get stuck on whips and chains, so freedom slip they brain
And psychologically that shit's insane
Now that's crazy, a function of raisin the crack babies
Sell it back to them cats freebasin back in the 80's
(C'mon) Disco shit, nigga cock the toast
Hi-Tek on the track and we rock with the Ghost

Damn right I make gangster music
But I still spit poetry 
like Langston Hughes did
Pressures of the ghetto might make you lose it
Grab AK's and go and make the news kid
Might lose control, but not my soul
Won't sell for the white man to buy me some white gold
Sell for the black man, to buy me control
P, Tek and Kweli, the shit come from the soul y'know?

Been Around,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I used to dream I would make it big
Told niggas I do when is done they would say I did
Lots niggas do it but they ain't do it the way I did
Its a cold world when your close friend they spray the crib
If you waiting on weight then you know what waiting is
Unless you waiting on freedom then you know what patience is
I pour the liquor then I roll it up
Seen alotta signs in my life but I ain't throw em up
Is cash that im trying to generate
If you ever been in a jungle you know my mental state
Cry when my homies done die but are my eyes rinse
Seen alot of dirt with these eyes here come the sirens
Is g code from them kilos
Be straight up with them niggas that put you below
I said the wolves might hurt you
Even when im all by myself im with a circle
Youll see when I spin around
I ain't just talkin boy I been around
Smell when the summer come could hear when the wind around
Seen when the spring comin pop when them things come
I ain't speak on fall cuz I won't mention it at all
If you dont know the rules then I won't tell you to ball
Ill let you know that the ghost back

Out the Way,Dime Bag,2018.0,"You gotta mastermind to your business
It's the best thing you could do
Trust me
Hahaha
Vinny Idol, nigga

Money on mind with a gun on my waistline
Think about death if you plannin’ to take mine
Shout out to the homies that's doin' the state time
Wasn’t race related but know it's a hate crime
Niggas hate bein' broke, hate bein' late on the rent
Hustle graveyard, a nigga laid on the bench
Came from the trenches, there's a pump in the trenchcoat
I love drug money, the plug send dope
But then I had to think about the game, it's
Death or a cell or a life full of pain
Once you get the picture, you could get up out the frame
'Cause a fed shot or a headshot's all the same
I’m just gettin’ money while doin' this G shit
Me and hoe blowin’ a O, leavin' the weed scent
Probably on the plane, I don't fuck with the pre-sent
'Cause the Jakes all in it, rats and snakes all in it

Stayin’ out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat
I'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets
So I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black
Stayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat
I'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets
So I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black

Not givin' a fuck is what I'm great at
Who wanna get hit in the face with the eight like, ""where the weight at?""
""Ghost don't play that""
Ghetto niggas'll say that
Laid back but I push your hairline way back
Scalped you like a native, shoot you like I'm a cowboy
Alpha and Omega, that data say I'm a wild boy
Tokyo drift when I shift
Let off a clip out the window with the left
Raise it up, proceed to dip
Who wants to live like that? Not I
Rather shop and pop by
Pull up in a drop five
The four-door M, no top and a Glock nine
I'm in the player's suite when I stop at the stop sign
I never tell a poor-ass nigga that I got mine
Unless I'm in my nine and I'm really on that time
'Cause I know it's on-site 'cause he tryna get me lined
Stay away from rats and them snakes and that swine, you'll be fine

Stayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat
I'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets
So I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black
Stayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat
I'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets
So I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black

Stayin' out the way, it's a new day
Used to be the handgun next to the cocaine
Flyin' on the through-way, sales goin' in and out
If you from the slums, you ain't have dinner
You don't give a fuck what the sinnin' 'bout
Jack boy, dope boy, better have the change
'Cause I seen the game, I ain't gon' have shit to show for it
Now I'm blowin' this weed, I'm gettin' chauffeured
Could put you on a poster or give you my poster
You say you gettin' that money, I tell you go for it
Wanna reach for your hammer? I tell you go for it
'Cause I put in my work and got the dough for it
When you sold your ass and was a hoe for it

Stayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'Cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat
I'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets
So I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black
Stayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'Cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat

Me I gotta eat I keep the heat
Run, picture me high clown
I don't give a fuck, ride later or ride now
Keep it on the waste
Let a nigga jump
I'll have him leaking from the face
And put a beating on the case
Niggas in the hood might hate me
But they don't try shit

Hang you from the helicopter
Hopping in the Yukon with the tanned out sofas
I only eat seafood
And when I look at these rappers I see seafood
I heard y'all don't give a fuck niggas, me too
We can mete up the bill
Matter fact we can meet up to kill
Niggas from cross town we can meet at the hill
Second album is coming, I'm expecting the hate
I'm the same S.P. so the weapons is placed
And I don't press charges
I'm the type of nigga that'll hop up out the garbage
Dressed in camoflauge like I came out the forest
Four in the Taurus

Deeper Than Most,The Ghost Sessions,2007.0,"Turnt on the TV this morning. They had this shit on about
'bout living in a violent, a violent world. Started thinking man
Either they don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's
Going on in the hood...

The Ghost is deeper than most is
Leave out the house grab the toaster, stuck in the sofa
Pop in the clip, hop in the whip, tryna get the last drop 'fore it drip
Hoody 'tire, any hood he ride
Fall back get good and high
Where the phone at, next to the cognac
Bring your chrome at wherever you bone at, it's on, Black
But you should've known that
I hit a dutch, hit another one and rip a clutch
I get your block blickied up, bitch nigga what
It feel good to hear the real hood
I could then and I still could
Cause my 9-mil is real good
I'm coming for you then I'm gunning for you
I don't get blunted with you get hundreds with you
Bitch nigga I'mma kill you if I want it with you
You can join on the list and get your number issued

You know my main problem in life, is being too hungry
I stay focused nigga. I'm on top of my game

Catch me where the haze is sticky like gum is
The guns is louder than thunder
You can get rained on, depending which cloud that you under
Ain't nothing fouler than hunger, I wonder
About a lot of shit, you ever shot a clip or got a brick
Me I did a lot of shit
But no scholarship, give a crackhead the keys, let him polish it
Street life, don't abolish it
They breaking rules now, making ratting seem cool now
You should bat the fucking fool down
Learned the game from a old timer
Big money made the hoes finer
Why you think he sold china? I could dig it like a gold miner
I ain't lame and I can't forget the game with Alzheimer's
This is SP the Ghost
Puffing on a bone, when I zone it affects me the most

I'm passionate about what I do. The streets affects me
In a very major way. I'm close to the concrete. I believe
What I say

Pocket full of DPs, honey from DC
Cayenne with the TV, living is easy
Back in sixth grade, who would believe me
Switchblade crazy wear my clothes looking greasy
Now I'm the boss of the bosses
If you think you married to the streets I could make you divorce it
Always hear me speak on the Porsches
I think it's the horses, and how it zig-zag on the courses
Big bags of money, try grabbing a fortune
The wheel get real, gotta spin it with caution
I ain't really into the flossing
I'mma stay dark, follow you home, get into your portion
The guns on fire like stovetops
I think you on the road to perdition
And, here's where the road stop
I ain't tryna fall, I just want it all
Why'on't you let me get the ball, I'mma show you the globetrot

Everybody need a turn. This time is mines. And if I fail
This time, I be up at bat again and again and again and again...
Sometimes you gotta accept where you coming from. But matter
Fact, fuck that. I'm kicking down the door. I'm on your ass
Niggas. Watch me. SP the Ghost",https://genius.com/Styles-p-deeper-than-most-lyrics
Monopolizing,The World’s Most Hardest MC Project  ,2012.0,"(Verse 1 - Styles P)
Like I’m sitting on the tear with years left ahead
Too much pain but I ain’t got a tear left to shed
I’m speakin to myself like yea, get the bread
The meat and the cheese too, the money will appease you
In case the love leaves you, nah
It’s only a meth that gets this type evil
All I know is takers and givers and fowl niggas
Ain’t no love, they just scared to throw paper around wit us
And we gotta go to heaven cuz the underground wit us
If we all don’t blow then I’d prolly die bitter
I figured the equation, everything’s amazing
You locked in the cage or stuck in the maze and
I burn your rat though, I tip my hat though
Cuz now it’s been said that the game is the devil’s last hope
I just wanna play God’s house
I’m on the streets though, still taking the hard route
(Chorus -  Large Amount)
Monopolizing, or how this game is being played
Every day I sit back and think if I should quit or stay
In many ways, this paper be calling, this is not a dream
I write rhymes to keep me from falling, tryin not to sleep
Monopolizing, or how this game is being played
Every day I sit back and think if I should quit or stay
In many ways, this paper be calling, this is not a dream
I write rhymes to keep me from falling, tryin not to sleep

Kill all racks then hard crack
Yeah that D block bullshit, I’m still on that
All rappers be aware cuz the villain’s back
50 shots, let me see who tried to dodge that
I had a crime scene lookin like we in Iraq
Hit the spot, jades closed and I spin right back
Hold up, Poovs wait, let me fix my hat
Now please raise the volume up so I can spit that crack
Smoke loud, pop perks til my lips get chap
And niggas I done seen grown men get kidnapped
All cuz they said they stash at endless racks
Back on my block we used to have endless packs
We started with it, pulling both Bentleys back, nigga
Chorus X 2
(Verse 3 - Styles P)
Insane like jackin the shinin, money rhyme it in Han sight
I only look for it when I’m findin
But you gotta find more than what you look for
Fool, but I know that there’s a book in the jewel store
Smoke good, get it high I cook raw
Tired of this every day ghetto shit
Hoes, strippers that try to get fellons to get your melon split
But if you know the game no tellin shit
These is the rules, I ain’t make em up
Yea they put em to sleep but couldn’t wake em up
He was just in the strip club throwin paper up
Now the family is throwin roses down
And these niggas is yelling they gonna hold it down

Foot on the gas, motto is to outride niggas

Blocks been shot up, they scared to walk through ‘em
Caught a body young, some niggas was scared to talk to ‘em

Seen Biggie on BET and wanted a Coogi on me
Fuck whoever you roll with, I don’t care who your homie
My lil’ homie don’t like to pass, he a shooter only

This money is a drug, I got addicted when I taste it
I was into checks, either TD or Chase it
In Parkchester, thinkin’ of a way to get this bracelet
So many rumors when your name get lit
The ones saying they did the most ain’t did shit
Got caught with a couple chicks and my name got picked
I’m the hottest nigga spitting for niggas ain’t got shit
Older niggas say I’m nice, they respect how I came in
All money ain’t good money, move when it makes sense
Hit the bar daily, I got New York on my back, nigga
Skinny body walk with a big gun, make ‘em act bigger
Broke but on Instagram, everybody act richer
Pack flipper
Three bitches, that’s company, I’m Jack Tripper

I was only a teen gettin’ money tryna stay out the way
But these sucka niggas never wanna stay in they place
So I’m straight
They just horsin’ around so hey
I’m OK, hope you still look the same at your wake
Better pray ‘fore the tech spray ya
We will literally x-ray ya
That’s why my team got the best players
I was taught to stack bread, talkin’ is cheap
Now my money do the talkin’, now they openly speak
I be runnin’ shit when you can barely walk in the streets
Since you preaching, hope your coffin is free
‘Cause we aim at foreheads
We pour lead, make sure they all dead
More spread, I got it in a Jiffy like cornbread
Cross me, nigga dead meat like Boar’s Head
You fronted out the blue, I left him and the floor red

You fuckin' with professionals, we clear the place out
In a place, leave a nigga face down (Trip her out)
We got the spot cased out

Recommendin' you go or recommendin' you know
You test me, I clap like it's the end of the show
Not your average Joe, I will stab you in your throat
Tryna duck the bad habits, got a habit with the smoke
I'm really tryna mature, niggas foul as manure
But they lack horsepower when I'm stronger than Thor
I explore my options, I employ myself, so
I enjoy myself, a nigga cliquin' on tours
I'm goin' through the window, nigga knockin' the doors
If you don't get the wave, my nigga, stay on the shore
I just need a lil' fame (Ohh) and that's word to Lil Fame (Ohh)
Bet this gun'll let you dance for the cash, I let it bang

You either (-) or (-) squeeze the TECs
I blow a smoke with the Ghost, bars speakin' death
I keep her wet, straight cash, yo, I'm 'bout paper
Pay (-) bars, every line another (-)

They can hate us, but they know they can't never play us
We heat-sprayers, plus you know the streets made us
Live life to the fullest because death is waitin'
Too wild of an animal for domesticatin'
Get a room full of rabbits and I'm defecatin'
Fully-loaded gun, no hesitatin'

Educated, actin' on medicated

About paper, known for movin' grams and mad toys

Speak the truth, know these frontin' niggas can't stand facts
Pops taught me Santa Clause wore a Klansman's hat
And he rolled through the night like the Klu Klux
So I flipped Os of the white for a few bucks
Yeah, I guess I see what they can't
Do what they won't, then have what they don't
Ride to work raw, where the work, y'all, I sit and curse, y'all

Time is money, Double R
D-Block, shit's real

I breathe off of liquor and weed and choose to be when the men sleep
I don't even pray with my eyes closed
Soulless screamin I know the demons, hide where the lies go
Try to fall back, off the lyrics with mysticism
Can't express myself, wild out and get shipped to prison
Got a lot of shit I could say
But it's kinda Ludacris that make niggas get out the way
Kinda selfish if I make niggas get out and spray
Leave you helpless and the only thing you do is you pray, nigga
Shit is God-made, or man-made and machine-made
I don't want beef I want money, that's the green way
The pride overpower the brain
I won't die like a coward, muh'fucker I'm vain
I'm a gangsta in the car in the dirt and the chains
I've been hurt and in pain, and stood tall in this urban terrain
But a man must admit to his faults, I know mine
I'm the type that always wanna revolt (yeah)
If I can't kill a nigga then I want an assault (yeah)
Shit hard, just listen to the bars shit's makin ya {?}

The Kansas made for Nicolo and me too
Lighting weed that's way greener than pea soup
Wronger than the oil from the tea tree
Staying alive, playing the Bee Gees

Hard spelled backwards If you soft pray to Isa
I’m a genius and a retard
Just the other day I stopped to piss onto D's car
You sweet and your heart pump Kool Aid

Probly blowing booty, mixed with the sour

Look at my eyes son, you won't see the next horizon
Kickin that typical rap, despicable rap
Or to get a hawk in your face, clip in your back
Guess who, still keep the thing in the sweatsuit
Hot blood leakin out your face is the best soup

We ain't gon' talk this much this year, ""Time is Money"" nigga

There's a science to our shit nigga (you know this)
We love each other muh'fucker
We'll die for each other, shit is real muh'fucker
{MARIO!!!}
I'm from a place where they die for a dollar bill
Some niggas get rich, most niggas just go to jail
Niggas in the hood, hit shit and they know it's real
Either get, life or some dough for the blow you sell
Which make me a hard fellow, paint the Benz the color of Caramellos
Sky blue and dark yellow, chillin in Palm Meadows
Tryin to get some M's in my hand
Can't see the picture need to look again or get your camera a lens
It's the game, who the fuck let the amateurs win
I hit the wind, time to sin, pick my man up at ten
He said P (whattup dawg) get the GT if you damaged the Benz
It ain't the money it's respect that make me man of the men
He said dollars is important to niggas
I told him holla let him earn it we extortin them niggas (hahaha)
Straight bodies, no slippin, no court for them niggas
Suck my dick, is the only words I offer them niggas
It's a new day and age, when I die throw {?} in my grave
And tell my niggas in the cage I wasn't able to save
Sometimes the streets get the best out of men, they got a cell for you
Crackers tryin to stretch out the pen, I go to hell for you
See like the eyes on the pyramids
They offer niggas death, cause they see they got fear of it
Shoot niggas in the head cause it's just an experiment
He said he was a thug to see his blood so they smearin it
What?

That leave exit wounds bout big as pot holes
If you dont want no problem keep your fucking mouth closed
Rappers can't see me like these niggas got on blind folds
I ryhme cold, cold hearted, flow retarded
Im from Philly where niggas will draw quicker than an artist
You just an artist
And you ain't hard, You the softest
Plus you ain't nice, Your shit's novice
I spit marvelous
I spit sick shit, make a nigga get nauseaus
Better be cautious
Cuz you dealing with some bosses
Kill you in your own crib, roll you up in yo carpet
Ain't no Ls being took over here, You better chalk it
Or get out-lined in it, nigga im demilit
And plus my back pocket got a baby nine in it
These niggas is finished
They ain't making no noise
I'm the reason why the fiends stuff they straights with the joy
Here to sepereate the Ape from the boys
I go to war with a sword and an iron mask on my face like in Troy
You get decapitated for all that faggot shit you fabricated
I spit pain and you's a lame, i know you have to hate it
Raw Buck nigga, this is spittage at it's greatest
Any nigga step in my path gon get assassinated

Poobs load up a beat
I light a blunt, Load up the heat
And then I go and sit it on the board
On the roof with my bars tryna spit it at the Lord
Stars and the moon
Yea I'm hard and a goon
But my hearts filled with hurt and my brain is consumed
Painful thoughts
Gainful thougts
I need a little change and I'm willing to change of course
But the long hard, road remains the course - I travel
Raps underground Marvin Hagler from the gravel
But I still got my sage bow and arrow
Some say I missed my just do
But I just do what I have to to touch you
Spirit and physical
Yea, I'm a real invidual
Drop alot of science
Name ring bells like a househould appliance
You could ask the giants
Been told y'all niggas that David killed Goliath
Say fuck the cops cuz I stand for defiance
Me and two guns make a real strong alliance
Might be losing now but I bet you I'mma triumph
Yea, I'mma win again
Mad high, been again
Outta state, tryna get cake like Entenmann's
Sara Lee
Who told the streets they could marry me?
No divorce of course I run this shit appearantly
Ghost give you the word it's a mother fucking guarantee

The game grimey don't expect it to be safe
And your safe protect the money, but who's protecting the safe?
And who's protecting you? You start to question your faith
How you real when everything that you representing is fake?
Seen you shake hands I never thought you would shake
When I was looking for love the devil sent me a snake
Betray me like Donnie did Lefty
I'll leave the clip empty
I don't pop in the air
I hold it down like Tony at the top of the stairs
Grind hard, hug the block, had it poppin for years
Lost homies, long story short, im tired of tears
Switched up, fell in love with the game and got married
Four fifth (.45) ridin Dirty like Harry
Your man clap what he don't carry
Me I get it in tryna see my cream grow
Talk Craps, Black Jack, Celo, Bingo
Back at it. Oh yea, that's my jingle
Large and Neem, Big lean, let that thing go
Get my lingo
Still rep Cinco Cinco!
Still negotiating with fiends
The only way to the cream
I'm only chasing a dream
So don't ask me what I sell or what I hustle
Go through hell so that my kids ain't got to struggle
I spit it because it's real and we armed with steel
S.P light it up like Fire Marshall Bill
My nigga mow up OG niggas and all that
Spot like Sals Pizzeria but all black
Show you what I do wit a ball bat
Swing like Mr 3000 be wilin
Haters stay hatin, ladies say they stay stylin
Know how I eat, big plates of baked salmon
Forget about them plans you expecting to spoil

To every child that's in the hood, it ain't no deers around here

Never ever rebel, just only time telling niggas

Listen real close, you hear the echos spit
I'm a wolf, you run around on some gecko shit
Kick in the door of the shit, wasn't left for bent
I kill the best now, tell me who the rest gon' get
Not a damn one, the handgun, is right on the waist
Whether you ugly or you handsome, I'm right in your face
You can run, I get excited from the flight of the chase
Little chimp, why don't you try to spend a night with the apes
I get higher than the flight outerspace, where I'm from

You can talk about getting fresh with people where they close for days
You can roll in a nice whip, we be rolling haze
Maintained in the game, and I'm so amazed
Only Jews that we got was advice
From the brothers that been through it
But I can ask my mother she's been through it
Back home in Africa where the struggle is real
I can say my blood line is spectacular
But it's a sin and I don't know my kin

Then stand in the hood right next to the creeps?
Watch it pop on the spot or less than a week
So I told my little homie know that all that shit is weak
Rather make a ton of money, watch all them niggas weep
Nightmares from the past, hold the shotty in my sleep
Askin' myself, ""Who could I trust?""
Be a player like Kobe or owner like Jerry Buss
Terry Cloth sweats in the 'Vette that's cherried up
Red suits, red guts, and they thinkin' I'm Blooded up
Told the plug send the work and them niggas'll cut it up like a DJ

Used the keep her in the doorway, no gloves hit her the raw way
Hangin was the foreplay, stamina's up I'm up to hit it all day
Cuz she love when I'm trickin' on her, and I don't get mad
When them other brothers is hittin' on her

Truth Be Told,Styles David: Ghost Your Enthusiasm,2020.0,"You frontin' on the 'gram, I'm frontin' on your man
He was actin' sideways, he was frontin' on the plan
Now they at the juice bars, backin' up the vans
Gotta shit load of fruit, we ain't packin' up the spins
We packin' up the stores, thugs you adore
'Cause we keep the hood healthy, give it to 'em raw
Wife had the vision and the pharmacy was born
Made a couple sales, now the pharmacy is on
Enough about that, back to the raps
Yeah, you learn to adapt when your finances lack
Some get a job and others get a pack
Couple niggas lose their way and they never get it back
They ain't even dead but they ain't livin' life
So, me I double up, yeah, you know I get it twice
Came from the dark so you know I get it bright
And I did a lotta wrong so I'm tryna do it right

Let the truth be told, let the lies be told
Know the good die young and may the wise get old
On a hot summer day, they make your life be cold
You can either play killer or the Gandhi role
Let the truth be told, let the lies be told
Know the good die young and may the wise get old
On a hot summer day, they make your life be cold
You can either play killer or the Gandhi role

You could try to front, me, I'm tryna punk
Reminisce on the past, no lights for a month
No food in the ridge, fuck life in this dump
Got a nigga real pissed, act hype if you want
You can get a shot to your body, a knife to your lung
Shit is gettin' dark, yearn for life in the sun
Burn weed, burn money, every bullet in the gun
Every tire on the whip just to get a lil' crumbs
With the yardie's eatin' jerk, smokin' pot, drinkin' Rum
I call my African cousin for dope in the drum
I call my Latin homie for coke in the slums
We went from white to green 'cause none of us is dunce
Feds goin' get you or the lead gon' get you
Or a grimy bitch that give good head gon' get you
If you thirsty for fame, the bread gon' get you
If you walk on the ledge, the edge gon' get you (Ghost)

Let the truth be told, let the lies be told
Know the good die young and may the wise get old
On a hot summer day, they make your life be cold
You can either play killer or the Gandhi role
Let the truth be told, let the lies be told
Know the good die young and may the wise get old
On a hot summer day, they make your life be cold
You can either play killer or the Gandhi role",https://genius.com/Styles-p-truth-be-told-lyrics
Street Shit,Master Of Ceremonies,2011.0,"Where my hood at?
Where them red and blue flags, where that good at?
Somebody tell them hood rats to come up front
And let the club know I'ma smoke my blunt

(Ghost!) Money green, weed green, hood black, heart black
And never let 'em see where you live, where you park at
Never let 'em know how you get it just squash that
Never let the beef ride long, go squash that
You can shoot it out, or go and peace it up
If we was in jail I would make you give your sneakers up
Cause I'm a loyalist, and I spray shit
The 44 make niggas look like crawfish
Cause you seafood, so go on sleep with 'em
I don't trust no niggas, I don't eat with 'em
Matter fact, I'ma keep it street with 'em
I don't like his style, I don't even speak with him
I keep it G from the get-go
Real go-getter, and I let my shit blow
You don't wanna get your shit broke
I got the hawk, you don't wanna get your shit broke

Where my hood at?
Where them red and blue flags, where that good at?
Where them vanillas? Where that sticky?
Where my right hand man with the blicky?
Somebody tell them hood rats to come up front
And let the club know I'ma smoke my blunt
Bitch!! This ain't Gucci, this ain't Prada
This street shit I'm fuckin with them niggas say ""nada""

Hey yo it's never gon' be another
Shocked the world with the half face gorilla cover
Clip on top of each other, now e'rybody wanna listen to the G
Funny I'm on the plane watchin ""Get Him to the Greek""
Twenty thousand when I land just to listen when I speak
Bully, he in my will somewhere, he like to eat
""I Get High,"" high like P's song (AYYYYY!)
That's why my shades on, used to be in love with Nia Long
Donny ain't around now I'll talk 'bout Viet Cong
That's means more bitches more haters on my song
But I don't go back and forth, me no ping-pong
Donny at your door like Avon, DING-DONG!
Yeah, me and my E hawk
Pop them things off on your block then later we pop klikko
Hah! Amazing ain't it?
If you can paint a bigger picture, well go 'head and pain it
Geyeah


Geyeah, bang like them white boys in mosh pits
Hach-too spit on your favorite rapper, he's not shit
... My catalogue is colossus
Blunt for the prelude, one for the process
Perform with a swarm of fully loaded objects
Make it clearer than Podus ring
I'm reachin for my phone cause I hear it before it ring
I'm reachin for my gun cause I hear it before it ring
... In the hood, I'm a muse
Phantom that's verbal, demolition in the booth
Slicker than the oil that you get at the masseuse
Chrome thing with the conehead in the goose
Addin in the Coupe, subtractin what I shoot
Get in with a axe and some matches and a noose
You have no idea, on the havoc I produce
'til it's way too late, the brain matter's on your shoes

Vinny’s Theme,Ghost in the Shell,2005.0,"The Ghost is deeper than most is
Leave out the house grab the toaster, stuck in the sofa
Pop in the clip, hop in the whip
Tryna get the last drop 'fore it drip
Hoody tied, any hood he ride
Fall back get good and high
Where the phone at, next to the cognac
Bring your chrome at wherever you bone at, it's on, Black
But you should've known that
I hit a dutch, hit another one and rip a clutch
I get your block blickied up, bitch nigga what
It feel good to hit a real hood
I could then and I still could
Cause my 9-mil is real good
I'm coming for you then I'm gunning for you
I don't get blunted with you get hundreds with you
Bitch nigga I'mma kill you if I want it with you
You can join on the list and get your number issued

You know my main problem in life, is being too hungry
I stay focused nigga. I'm on top of my game

Catch me where the haze is sticky like gum is
The guns is louder than thunder
You can get rained on, depending what cloud that you under
Ain't nothing fouler than hunger, I wonder
About a lot of shit, you ever shot a clip or got a brick?
Me I did a lot of shit
But no scholarship
Give a crackhead the keys, let him polish it
Street life, don't abolish it
They breaking rules now, making ratting seem cool now
You should bat the fucking fool down
Learned the game from a old timer
Big money made the hoes finer
Why you think he sold china? I could dig it like a gold miner
I ain't lame and I can't forget the game with Alzheimer's
This is SP the Ghost
Puffing on a bone, when I zone it affects me the most

I'm passionate about what I do. The streets affects me
In a very major way. I'm close to the concrete. I believe
What I say

Pocket full of DPs, honey from DC
Cayenne with the TV, living is easy
Back in sixth grade, who would believe me
Switchblade crazy wear my clothes looking greasy
Now I'm the boss of the bosses
If you think you married to the streets
I could make you divorce it
Always hear me speak on the Porsches
I think it's the horses, and how it zig-zag on the courses
Big bags of money, try grabbing a fortune
The wheel get real, gotta spin it with caution
I ain't really into the flossing
I'mma stay dark, follow you home, get into your portion
The guns on fire like stovetops
I think you on the road to perdition
And, here's where the road stop
I ain't tryna fall, I just want it all
Why'on't you let me get the ball, I'mma show you the globetrot

Everybody need a turn. This time is mines. And if I fail
This time, I be up at bat again and again and again and again...
Sometimes you gotta accept where you coming from. But matter
Fact, fuck that. I'm kicking down the door. I'm on your ass
Niggas. Watch me. SP the Ghost",https://genius.com/Styles-p-vinnys-theme-lyrics

He’s waitin' on traffic, me, I'm waitin’ in traffic
If you did it big, my nigga, do it Jurassic
Double park on the drug lot, leave on your hazards
Shorty look young, but I'll bet he's a dirty bastard
I don't give a fuck, I leave ‘em a dirty casket
.38 shell on his lips like it's a Chapstick
Legs all up in the air like it's a back flip
Chill, Goose, you way too cool, get on your cash shit
Hash in the bathtub, overseas and fast shit
I don't stress killin' these niggas, I like laughin’
Joyous moments with the richer crowd
Catch the lick, bring the piff around, stick around
Now this ain’t the type of spot you bring the blick around
It's the yacht to the helicopter, niggas lookin’ hella problem
Hope niggas get the picture now
If not, you need a different lens, maybe you need different friends
All I know is shit is gettin' thicker now, goose, niggas

My eyes tell a story, there's a pain in my soul
My hustle keep goin', hope I don’t lose control

And both you close off to the Madeline (Madeline)
Switchin' the paradigm (Ooh)
I need a paradise who's stay, smells sweeter than Caroline
Got three stacks for the portables (Woo)
Retract from these overdue bills
Detached, I got more to prove still
Relapsed, I'm supposed to do mill', nigga
This is entitlement (Woo)
Uh, mama called it confidence
Papa said a dollar spent is nada since you can't get it back
If you honor it, what did I do to get outta this?
I'm like whoa, whoa
Dealin' with shit like niggas who lie out the windpipe (What else?)
Navigate this life, actin' like shorty, I been pipe, life is a bitch
Uh, this right here is dedication (What else?)
This right here is hesitation (Alright)
Conquered, do not have with role models that demonstrations
I done rose up, had to be a grown up
Just to realize we your children that was forced to grow up
Heroes never showed up
Tried to read the signs, but it's blocked by the ones they throwed up (Woo)
Pokin' down the pieces, said it's worth it where you blow up
Uh, yeah, journey of a thousand miles (Yeah)
Smarter herb to make you smile (Woo)
Purchasing' it by the pounds, yeah
Flippers deeper than the now (Woo, woo)
Learn the haters in denial (Facts)
I ain't got no time to waste (Ah)
I'm just here to make you proud

Come Thru,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Evening, is the time of day
I find, nothing much to say
Don't know, what to do.. but I come to

Here's why they call me the ghost - I'm half live half dead
And when there's beef I bring all of the toast
And I got more guns than most of New York
And I ain't got to say shit cause the toasters'll talk
Holiday Styles ignorant nigga
Tre pound four pound still tearin off your ligament nigga
I'm the hardest rapper out bitches diggin a nigga
And like anybody who beef can swim in the river
When I walk through the door all the children'll shiver
It's like, ""He's so gangsta - y'all so pussy""
I murder y'all faggots so y'all don't push me
All I know is goin through hell, blowin a shell
I got, down so hard I thought no one'd tell
But I was damn wrong, I hold it down like my man's gone
I shoot anything I get my fuckin hands on
To leave y'all coward niggas bloody like a tampon


Yo.. E Nicks where you at nigga?
Uhh, uhh, yo
I'm sick and tired of rappers talkin 'bout, all this chedder
And when you see them in the streets got a bullshit Jetta
I'm like dog stop frontin, you shouldn't be braggin
And why the fuck you got rims if you push a Volkswagen?
I spit vicious, let my bank account switch digits
And if money was height - you'd be midgets (go on nigga)
I spit hard save it, sinner nigga affadavit
And next to God, I'm most niggas mom favorite
Y'all talk gangsta but you notice the mob
And I could bring you to the hood and get, both of you robbed
You see I live in the streets, I sleep in the streets
Fuck it - I probably got, more guns than police
Niggas say I'm too hard, them niggas too soft
Straight pussy, I heard they suck dick up North
And it ain't so foul so, hold your breath
And you probably still real just a gangsta left


All I can say this the game I chose
For this European car and these name brand clothes
Get respect from these niggas, spit game at hoes
Come down with a bounce and a strange-ass flow
I got bigger than I thought I would
I did shit that I thought I could
Act rowdy cause I fought that good
Them blocks is mine I bought that hood
They know I squeeze, smoke trees, and blow bo-dies

And your boss even know, that y'all niggazs can get it
Have y'all skeleton CRACKED, and some holes in your fitted
Have your body chopped up, in six different lakes
And you ain't even safe right in front of the Jakes
They call me Stan Still, cause I fuckin just stand still
And most of y'all niggazs run, plus your mans will
Folded up in a corner, behind a van still
And your hoes can get it, then your mans will",https://genius.com/Styles-p-come-thru-lyrics

I might go and get it for the sake to be different
When you know he had it comin', bet the wake'll feel different
You really earned the money, but the cake will feel different
Stop runnin' from the cops, you will wake a little different

You ain't got to knock 'em, but you ain't got to fuck with 'em
Let 'em tell you different, then them niggas on some pussy shit

,good lookin cuz
I got a little story to kick on this one
Ghost style

So Authentic
Sitting in a bullshit apartment that is rented and my soul's tormented
A big pile of coke,a grimy ass bitch I dont trust for a minute because her nose all in it
The shit's still for sell though, my man went to jail though
Left fifty birds,10 guns,weed and a scale yo
She hit me on my jack right
I was in the lab blowin' Ackright
In the booth tryna get my stacks right
She said come through, because dinner lookin' mad nice
She went to Shop-Rite and got the chicken for the half price
Im like this bitch dont cook, and me and her dont eat
So I know she sweet
Yeah her man went to jail I know he up shits creak
She got keys in the crib i'll get them off this week
So I hopped in the truck yo, blowin on the dutch yo
I know I shouldn't do it but I dont give a fuck though
x2
If you fuck with a murda mommy
You gon' fuck around and have to murder mommy
I'll do her greasy like I never heard of mommy
? big poppa can deal with a murder mommy

She said they 12.5
I got 125 on me,I can buy 10 break em' down let em' dive on me
250 can get me twenty though
Shit ain't lookin funny though, a nigga need money though
Half a million can get me forty
Me and my little shorty can kick it like Barry Gordy
Soon as I thought it,heard a knock at the door
Pause,heard a lap cock at the door
That sounds like a Colt .45
Government issued,im thinking that I dont wanna die
My shit was on my side,pulled it out hit her in the eye
Gun buck,the dumb slut wanna die(bitch)
Door flew in,so did the mass dudes
Cash rules,fuck that we all gon' blast tools

Eyes and ears missin' em
No time for dissin' em

Name a day and an hour I'll set off the detonation
I speak what I feel
And I keep this shit real
So it's hard for the kid to get radio penetration
A leaf 'bout to turn
Only in America will a boiler earn millions
When Sheek get his turn

But I plan on whippin'
Suttin' that look different
On the lean when it's sittin'
Switch cars like clothes and I ain't bullshittin'

All them niggas play me in them lil' black radios
White tee, long shorts, throw away P80 yo

Leaving the game,Ghost in the Shell,2005,"[Intro}
Yeah! Yeah we out of the game baby!
Tired of this shit!
Too many niggers ratting, no rules, no principles, no morals
What has these streets come to?

It's all good, it's alright (I'ma play it like the old timers do)
I'm leaving you tonight (I'ma slide on you niggers n go)
It's all good, it's alright (Get on my carriage or somethin')
I'm leaving you tonight (Cowards, not gon' rat on me)

I'm leaving the game, tonight I'm out
You can have my Glocks, my blocks, my chains
You can have everything except my name
And a couple pounds of smoke to keep me sane
I'm tired of this hustling, D-low and shuffling
Everybody suffering, think I need a buffering
Gunning with the Glocks, running niggers' blocks
But I got my own kids, all the sonning shit can stop
I don't think I'm all that, but I been doing dirt since I was 12 years old
I think it's time to fall back
Just trying to be a family man, chilling in the family van
Headed to the movie theatre, PG flick
Every time I open my safe I see these bricks
Every time I open my coat I see this clips
Start feeling stressed out so the weed get lit
And I'm thinking to myself that I don't need this shit
What!

It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight
It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight

Too many new faces (I don't know you?!)
I think niggers' wired, there's too many new cases
Before I go to jail I rather bow out gracious
Blunt to the face in a place that's spacious
Laying around sure beats a quarter for laying you down
Coz it's hard being pop and a boss
Everyday in my life revolves around my kids, profit and loss
If I ain't meeting with a teacher, I'm meeting with execs
Or I'm meeting with the pumper whose holding a street-sweeper
I'm thinking about quitting, I always got a headache
And my stomach started hurting I'm having trouble when I'm shitting
I ain't slept in a year, from reefer and beer
Plus I come from the hood where they creep from the rear
But I'm leaving tonight, breezing tonight
For some strange reason, my breathing ain't right
So I'ma pack my bags and leave on a flight
What!

It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight
It's all good, it's alright
I'm leaving you tonight

I'm gone with the wind, I'ma hit the road like I'm touring again
Pack the family up, put em all in the Benz
Got some phone calls but I'm stalling my friends
I'll see them all in the end
I'm out like super-fly, I get super-high
Might as well quit while I got a little loot to ride
Can't go to jail, the cells ain't super-sized
Plus I'm stuck in hell in a place where you shoot or die",https://genius.com/Styles-p-leaving-the-game-lyrics

Fuck around and get your ass killed by a gun of yours
I'm a hundred bars, still'd get a ton of raw
Fly like them niggas that was comin' through the tunnel doors
Yeah, in Palladiums, now we in the stadiums
Weed for my Cali niggas and my Canadians
Probably forgot the spot I parked my Mercedes in
On a world tour, I got blunts and I'm blazin' 'em

We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand
Diamond bezel upper band on the couch where I stand
Harlem, YO, Queens flow, y'all know
We on a world tour with Cîroc on my hand
Diamond bezel upper band on the couch where I stand
BX, BK, Staten Isl', we play

Uh, clip in the Cuban Cuban link holdin' Jesus head
Foot on the table cause the bottom my sneaker red
Sneakerhead, money flat, call it pita bread
Derek Jeter's bread, run the base 'til I see the feds
Huh, it's too much money the crib for
Could 'ford, duck and aim at your target and then pour
Far as eatin', man, I been full
Cookin' up, hear my minute soda like the Timberwolves
Renovatin', just bought the flash in
Old gangsta spot where the niggas with cash win
Ballgoers like lawnmowers, get to grassin'
Try 'em, show us Louboutin loafers we be flashin'
Uh-huh, we only speakin' for paper
Barzini, whoever set up the meeting's a trader
Players ball, I slip my feet in some 'gators
Coogi blazers, mansions, white people for neighbors

I could never get rich enough to go and buy the ocean
I play in (-) and just sit up in the ocean
Close your eyes and you can feel emotion
Blowin' a lie while I'm ridin' the wave floatin'
Spot in the Ritz, 'nother one in the Trump too
Get what I like and what little brother would want too
Smoke for the dead, drink for the incarcerated
Suede parka, (-) made it
Loro Piana suits, smooth it if it's tangible
Niggas is animals, killing's understandble
You could manage the money or let the money manage you
Fuck out of here when the forty bullets is blammin' you
Makin' a toast with niggas niggas remember
Standin' in the Center, Oscar de la Renta
Shades, boots and suits, I'm a die a member

Murder Mommy,UnKnown,UnKnown,"So authentic, sittin' in a bullshit apartment that was rented and my soul's tormented
Big pile of coke, A grimey ass bitch I don't trust for a minute cause her nose is all in it
Shit is for sale though, my man went to jail though, got 50 birds, ten guns, weed, and a scale yo
She hit me on the jack right, I was in the lab blowin' ak right, in the booth tryna' get my stacks right
She said come through, cause dinner is lookin' mad nice. She went to shop right, and got the chicken for half price
I'm like ""This bitch don't cook"", and me and her don't eat, so I know shits sweet
Yeah, my mans went to jail, I know he's up shit's creek. She got keys in the crib, I'll get 'em off this week
So I hop in the truck yo, blowin' on a dutch yo, know I shouldn't do it but, I don't give a fuck though

If you fuck with a murder mommy, you gon' fuck around and have to murder mommy. I'll do it greazy like I never hearda' mommy. Glade big poppa, you deal with a murder mommy

She said they're 12.5, I got 125 on me. I could buy 10, break it down, let 'em dive on me
250 will get me twenty though, shit ain't lookin' funny though, nigga need money though
Half a million can get me 40. Me and my lil' shorty can kick it like Berry Gordy
Soon as I thought it, heard a knock at the door, pause..... Heard a loud cock at the door. (Gun-Cocks)
That sounds like a colt .45, Government issue, I'm thinkin' that, I don't wanna die
My shit is on my side, pulled it out, hit her in the eye. Gun-butt the dumb slut when I die
Door flew in, so did the masked dudes, cash rules, fuck that, we all gonna' blast tools

Guess what's on the menu for breakfast
Roll with The Ghost if you wanna get messed up

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, hide the eighths
And I'm tryna stay positive
But I wile out
And who am I to lie to fate?
But I ain't tryna ride the gates
Getting wise, while I'm institutionalised
Seen my man on the dancefloor boofin' them knives
Selling dope in the pen to send loot to their wives
You don't know the meaning of grinding
Street life, meet life with bad timing
We all was involved in criming
I went from dead broke
To going out wining and dining
European cars, jewellery shining
Clothes from the latest designers
Ready to bleed and take heat
Back then we was minors
Now I see life through a clear lens
Die for my dear friends
You can see the Benz from the rear end
Come through doing a buck suttin'
Fuck front and back niggas down
When I pull up and touch suttin'
End of a ten year run now
I don't wanna talk everybody get gunned down
Only count hundreds, I don't fuck with the ones now
That's a lie, count every dime

Contact from the weed

Watching her bend again, dancing for many men
Tell me have ever though about getting in (have you ever thought)

Went through his back but it started at his naval
You your brothers keeper but, Cain killed Abel

Throw Down,The Diamond Life Project,UnKnown,"Ain't nothin' promised but death, but accepting it's kinda drastic
Momma scared to sleep, cause she visioned me in a casket
Black, say he cursed, somehow I feel like he past it
Now I hit the hood with a K and a piece of plastic
Most of my sisters gone; how the fuck is this shit apart of life?
Right after the judge send me brother to do a couple lives
I know I'm supposed to be grateful; the devil made me hateful
Lookin' at my dog on the table; condition wasn't stable
Told 'em ""bring him back"", but the doctor told me they wasn't able
Walk with me; I'll show you a movie, that shit you see on cable
They found my homie momma murdered, face inside her Bible
He was destined for NFL, now he suicidal
Damn; lookin' at my son, I only think to stay
Instead of thinkin' ""what could make it worse?"", I only think to pray
Cause where I'm from, they tell me all gangstas gon' die the same
Before I let 'em crash my dreams, I'mma fly like a plane

Always a go-down, always a showdown
I'm on an up-and-up, cause niggas is low-down
I be fuckin' up, pray to God that I slow down
But this the fast life, throw it up if you throw down
Always a go-down, always a showdown
I'm on an up-and-up, cause niggas is low-down
I be fuckin' up, pray to God that I slow down
But this the fast life, throw it up if you throw down

I know the fans listen
From the hood to Hollywood; it's a transition
Face under my hood, just like a transmission
Grams to ambition; I recall re'n-up and a gram missin'
Mom Christian; father was a black spade
Uncle funeral parlor cause of a black gauge
I rap, I'm paid, and they well jealous
They almost got me, I shot three 
I'm from the hood, medicate 
If Fred afraid, then tell us; doubt that
Well money, murder, I'm 'bout that
And they about it, too
I'm tryin' stay focused, God forgive me what I'm 'bout to do
I know more people in a coma than diplomas
The gun powder aroma, with Coronas on the corner
Well, I play the stoop, and then i spray the deuce
Niggas lie; my homie Trae the truth

Always a go-down, always a showdown
I'm on an up-and-up, cause niggas is low-down
I be fuckin' up, pray to God that I slow down
But this the fast life, throw it up if you throw down
Always a go-down, always a showdown
I'm on an up-and-up, cause niggas is low-down
I be fuckin' up, pray to God that I slow down
But this the fast life, throw it up if you throw down

Am I addicted to pain?
We'll stumble in the sun, but we'll never slip in the rain
Is insanity sane?
I pray when I'm high or I ride; now is that foul?
Blowin' a blunt, but I'm exhalin' a black cloud
When I die, don't cry, nigga, laugh loud
Twenty-one gun salute with a mask, in a masked crowd
Shooter and the horker
But I don't wanna charger or sin
Take out my pain as the MC or the author
Brother gone, father gone, couple of the homies gone
Time flyin', I'm ready to get my lonely on
I wanna see time fly with the Rolly on
Sort of like a Blood and Crip, mixed with the Corleone
South African warrior blood, in my veins
With them Y-O, warrior bars, in my brains
With a tormented soul
'Til all my niggas roll with the cars, and the gold, and the money to grow old

Always a go-down, always a showdown
I'm on an up-and-up, cause niggas is low-down
I be fuckin' up, pray to God that I slow down
But this the fast life, throw it up if you throw down
Always a go-down, always a showdown
I'm on an up-and-up, cause niggas is low-down

Whattup Buzzy? Whattup cuzzy?
You could get popped if you skinny or you chubby
Catch me on the push if the kush look fuzzy
Gangster and a gentleman, everybody love me
Catch me in the Chevrolet
Every day thinkin' of a better way
A long way from robberies and getaways, strugglin'
Cocaine and baking soda bubblin'
Do it for my homies on trial verse the government
Of the United States
On the creep, don't sleep stay wide awake
Life is like chess, but never forget the checkers
Try to jump, get the pump or hit with the trifecta
That's the tre pound, or the tre eight
Even furious Styles couldn't keep Tre safe
Let it do what it do
But if you don't get it done then you should do somethin' new
My homies get it in then I'mma do somethin' too
Matter of fact, I'mma do somethin' first
You could set it off, I'mma do somethin' worse
Yeah, I'm just tryin' to get cash
Live four and die six letters with a dash
The diesel taste good, but it's better with the hash
Like a Channel 5 show, yeah the veteran's a mash
Yeah I might brag, but it's never about cash
If I got it and my homie don't, I gotta move fast
One for all, all for one, brand nubians
In them hotel rooms with Peruvians
Cubans, Columbians, Dominicans, hooligans
If I'm in the spot, then you know I got the ruger in
S-P the ghost, you couldn't walk in the shoes I'm in

I'm livin' life in-live-livin' life in
Livin' life in the fast lane
Gotta stay fresh cause I live by my last name, Styles

With the model chick that love to act a felatio
Bullet to your body, I know the exact ratio
Come from the soul like pasta noose and macyo
Plug 1, plug 2, plug 3
Rip slow, 1 slug, 2 slug, 3
On the block, drug 1, drug 2, drug 3
Epitome at heart, balls in delivery
It's hard to the day niggas is giving me the god
And if Satan waitin'
I try to kill him, no debatin' hatin'
I'm on all like my niggas elevatin'
Kinda fascinatin'
You down bitch? Or you in the cell masturbatin'?
Soul assassination, either you get it or you don't get it
Either you will or you won't, with the smell smoke ghost lit it
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
Nustso, schizo, go for the gusto
Bounce when it blitz though, house of the rich though
I didn't wanna die from the balls of the pistol
Lie, keep a nigga brain fired like Crisco
Niggas wanna shine like the ball at the disco
Want that money long like a headline of frisco
It's not the young boys or the OG's that get you
Yea a bullet might, but a missile won't miss you
D block on me but we went and enlist you
We all ball but we wanna assist you
I don't ref but got stripes and I'm official
Never been got but my nigga I get you
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
If it's a lockout, we gon hop out
We don't pop shit, we make shit pop out
Money coming and going fast but the weed burn slow
Other niggas will die but their seeds gon grow
Yea I move H, you kept the G from the dough
I will lay a nigga down with the 4
Or any caliber gun that's in my hands
Defend my land and defend my mans
I ain't the judge but recommend you stand
Cuz I'm your honor when they move guns and grams

Not the kid
I could do this shit forever nigga

This is for the junkie on the track with a monkey on his back
I feel bad cause I got him like that
This is for the G's, this is for the hustlers
Get a whip off the lot and still upgrade the muffler
Tryin to hit the block, nobody else there yet
Get it poppin with your baby mom welfare check
And I'll ring your bell, go fuck how you felt yo
Blowin on weed if it's sticky like velcro
Bounce in, bounce out, always got an ounce out
Dig in your right pocket, 20 G count out
Used to ask yourself, what you wanna do this for?
Good Jewish lawyer turn a ten to a two-to-four
You in the game cause the game is in you
Who to blame, said I never came, I know the pain is in you
I feel you, been there, I was in there
But I ain't goin back like, I ain't been there
Can't make a million behind bars
Chill in a fly car, sit in the five-star
If you think I'm preachy just check out the dialogue
I'm knockin the iPod, first class as I go through the sky loft
What?

I don't really need a hook, I got lyrics
Feel me Kid, you know?

Talk in bricks and speak in the buildings
Construction, grown now, gotta think of the children
No gangsters, real ones, you know that kill the civilians
The roughest, the addicts, Japanese and Sicilians
The rule to the sign'll say, ""P, did you calm down?""
Cooled out, but never ever put my arms down
Tell the boys ring the alarm now
Cops is comin, I ain't got a gun, I come with a bomb now
So hard I walk the city in the streets, see Biggie in my sleep
Then put 50 and the 20 in my leaf
I might wear somethin with logos, or dress like a hobo
Smack any rapper that showboat
Wanna battle me that's a no-no, uh-uh
Shiesty, sorta like the block you was juxed on
Please don't provoke me to shoot at
I know you vagina, and your right-hand man is a douchebag
P is on the low where the loot at
Nine in the linin of the goose coat, deuce in the bookbag
E'rybody think that I look mad
But I don't really care cause they don't think that'll look bad
Feel me!

I mean I do what I do, easily
I mean I'm a lyricist
If somebody's nicer let me know
I'll be here for a minute, y'knowmsayin?
Y'all know my name, should I say it? Ha ha!
Chach, let's get the fuck outta here
I like it like this
I'm just warmin up!

Usually ride around in a deep thought
The dutchie's will burn
I chose to learn whatever the streets taught
They ain't got respect for a weak boss
Soon as you creep off
They gon' turn your shit into meat sauce
Catch me in the alpha fatigue
Thinking of jail is hell
So I exhale a mouth full of weed
And my man caught a body
Had to bounce on his seeds
Made me drop a tear drop
From the fountain of greed
Say life in the slum is horrendous
Stay in school you gotta keep your gun in attendance
My niggas go numb don't come to the sentence
They hit 'em hard
They gon' hit the yard and straight go for the fences
Spit from the spirit and soul
Hop in the whip
Tell my nigga ""Pass some shit I can roll""
I'm kinda loose every now and then i get out control
I might pull it just to see the bullet get out the hole
God damn, am I damned by god?
No remorse when I blam the rod
Rodeo Drive, nigga scan the card
(It's what they want)
You god damn fucking right
The hood is mad, the good get bad
When they see that the truck is right
Make a little cash then them bitches'll suck it right
You should understand, I'm just living the fucking life
Plus I keep a gun on me, hawk work real mean
Ready to die, you know I seen real green

Money make the world go 'round, plus vertical
From no car to a luxury convertible
Niggas that had love now wanna murder you
I be spazzin', blitzin' like all Madden
Me and this pretty hunny sharin' this orgasm
I'm on the 'Gnac and shorty on the Murlo
Fur coat to the homie on the furlo
Drivin' on murder beach, slow than a turtle
65 there then 65 back
You could get a million dollars off of 65 stacks
We neither here, we neither there
But if the car smell like smoke then nigga Febreze the air
Spray the ozium, still break bread
With niggas that move opium and still racketeer
Huntin' for money so run like a pack of deer
If you ain't heard me clear that's why I'm clappin' at your ear

Three guns on set, which one you wanna hear
Got the paper on deck, throw that money in the air

Tell these rap niggas round they little posse up
Your cars got bigger and your jewels got rockier
But the Ghost move just like the mafia

Knockin' I ain't home then go to my other house
My moms ain't home then go to her other house
Real till I go to my father and little brother's house

God forgive me for robberies, never was a beggin' nigga
Put 30 holes and you fuckin' with a 7 nigga

Shoot You Down,Float,2013,"Play no more around this town
Play no more around this town
'Cause I am gonna shoot you down

Half asleep, half up
Mad high, scheming on a fast buck
You know me that's if I got my mask up
I'm mad cool like the AC on max
Show money on weed and the clothes out of sacks
No soil in the jungle so we rose from the cracks
Of the sidewalk, why you think we specialized in 
fly talk?
From the dark side of the force, but I could sky walk
Know it ain't a pizza shop but nigga get them pies off
Remember misery loves company
Yo homies got yo back but ask yo self, who's fronting me?
How much is the work worth?
How much getting murk worth?
Sometimes I get high and I wonder if church works
As I changed the first verse and the kirk first
Gonna ask myself – yo, how much is the verse worth?
I know it's priceless but I still gotta charge a price
Shit is static, go back to the heart of life

Play no more around this town
Play no more around this town
'Cause I am gonna shoot you down

Masked like Bane, Dark Knight like Wayne
Gangstas with mic skills is missing from the game
Stand up G, I strive for my son
But the cold ass streets forced me to cradle with my guns
Ones is the only thing that matters
I try to keep it real, they just care about swagger
King of New York shit, meet me at the Plaza
You can talk shit and get pluck with the dagger
I'm on it, on one, up one
Probably on the dolo with the Top Gun
Shout to polo niggas with the dutch done
Trinnies on the bamboo, jeps on the raw booze
Salute to the jail niggas that never wanna call home
You should do the science
If you don't know math then build your alliance
But will yo man stand in the pan when you frying?
All of us is living but all of us is dying
Getting money or you trying

Play no more around this town
Play no more around this town
'Cause I am gonna shoot you down

Blow a OZ, meditate and levitate
The time is money nigga so we never wait
We got shit to do, kill you all for principle
Cool and I ain't listen 'cause I thought I was the principle
Custom kidding on the European
You see me, I blow the weed and then I look Korean
But I ain't from Korea though
Life's a bitch, money gon' burn like gonorrhea though
It's all truth or it's all lies
Need a bionic man on a full guy

Cop money for crack as a teenager

Tried to speak my mind but they don't vent

I just want the bank rolls,  a game, think of Saint Row
Roll around a nigga, let the thang go

Ghost (Cost),UnKnown,2015.0,"I'm African, shit, I rain dance
Grab my liquor and bebop and do the pain dance
Shit, I listen to Kendrick, Sir Jimi Hendrix
In school, they put hard and the card in my index
My momma gave her son the paper towel and Windex
Told the boy, 'Clean', but he starin' at the scene
Fast cars and pretty women, pockets full of green
Like, 'One day I have all that shit'
Then one day I had all that shit
They call me Fortune-Tellin' Ghost how I call that shit
If you on the wrong path, I know it, I took the same tracks
Except, I hear my final destination and came back
Explain that, I slang crack
Rob shit, they tried to bang on me, then I banged back
But then you're high off the weed and you're starin' at your seeds
Like, 'Where the fuck my friends at?'
When you cool, they think you soft
When you hard, they think you off
How the fuck you rearrange that?
I sat back and did the math
I been to hell and back and twice paid my dues, no change back
No complaints, I just asked, 'Where the strains at?'
It seem to be seen laided up, where the planes at?
I meet you at the rendezvous, yeah, cause I be on the runway too
Déjà vu 'bout gunplay too
God, forgive us cause we hustle on Sunday too
Miss a soul cause we probably missin' out on that Sunday food
Ain't no family at the table cause you thinkin' 'bout the label
And the block and what the sales on Monday do
Yeah, and then Tuesday too
Missed the week cause that's what puday do
We own the night, but figure what the new day do

Beats to the rhyme, street full of crime
Rap or the gat I got heat for your mind
Beats what a nigga got asleep on your spine
On the creep and the grind, rap the work or double up
Hit you with a scar on your cheek, watch it bubble up
Man pull the Hummer up, shoot any runner-up
Real cool niggas but we might fuck the summer up
Niggas wonder what I'm involved in
See me all alone when I'm runnin in Harlem
Bronx and Queens, fuck that I live life like I'm starving
You don't like me, fuck you nigga!
I don't trust you, I cut you or bust you nigga
I shoot up where you hustle nigga, fuck the program up
Rob all your workers, cut yo' grams up
You dealin with big niggas or pig niggas
P don't give a fuck when it's time to jig niggas
(I don't give a fuck) You dig? Niggas big
Run up in the crib and wig niggas and I don't mean fake hair
You can bet that I'm goin, they said that there's cake there
Might as well get them candles out; we ain't makin a wish
We sayin a prayer cause I blammed you out - what?
Guess who back? It's P with the P-91
38 Specials, the extra gat
In the souped up Mirada nigga, extra black - what?

You know who I am

Rude Boy Hip Hop,Phantom and the Ghost,2014.0,"That 187 when the ghost on spree
I like the toy rappers run for cover tonight
It's 187 when the lights on spree
It's that rude boy hip hop, New York shit that you like

Vocals out of the windpipe is giving you insight
Real New York nigga, that's word to the pin stripes
Can't fly the kite less the wind right
Blow the city up then skip on that Jeremy Lin light
Yeah, I'm a shooter like Glen Rice
Long range and the Range the color of corn
Watching the Bull game
Like bird in the garden with the leprechauns
Everything is money, upper echelon
Cheaper than the food in a Chinese restaurant
On the corner in the hood
They come to body a man, you'd warn them if you could
If you can't you body them niggas and leave 'em in the woods
Faith before favor, lighten our senses since Scarface here
Niggas will kill your family for Scarface bread
I'm on suicide dough, SP, the ghost on coast with no strap flow
What up

I like the toy rappers run for cover tonight
It's 187 when the lights on spree

Lyricist, the weed is the therapist, the therapy
Cause my pedigree is higher than yours will ever be
Devil got kicked out of heaven because of jealousy
Balls is like mental telepathy with melody
Niggas can't measure my wave length
Playing Max B when I'm pounding the pavement
You should get paid off the shit you engaged in
Fresh every day like the shit's an occasion
Tell my son to do what I say, don't do what I do
Did shit I shouldn't have done for a dollar or two
And you'll always be the leader, never follow the crew
Study today then peep what tomorrow could do
And you keep your ears open for wise words
The bird's the only animal that's meant to fly first
Cause you crawl before you walk and you walk before you run
And you fly around the world and you shine like you the sun

Act up and get shot through your clothing or coat
And now that we back to the hoodies
Extra clips in the footies, have niggas lookin ""Damn how could he?""
Leave them niggas lookin like that
And they ain't no gangsters, they ain't in Queens or Brooklyn like that
Heard niggas made it big time, no lookin back

Got a homie wit' the shotgun, sittin' on the couch
Got a homie that I'm bringin' to the plug, got a vouch
Got a homie that's gon' drive us there, said we gotta bounce
Got homies in the slums, got homies in the bin
Got homies outta town, movin' work, do they think
I tell you what I got, I ain't talk about money
But you bet I got a homie that would hit you with the dummy
He gon' wrap you like a mummy though, dick up in your bunny
Get the code to the safe, yeah, this thug life is funny
Got a homie that is blood, got a homie that is crip
Got a homie that is icy but he ain't never slip
Other homies to connect, yeah, we get it every trip
Other homie workin' out, yeah, we get it every drip
But we still got the hammer when we pull up to the strip
You got homies too? (Too) Then you know how the homies do
Homies that'd die for me, I ain't never told 'em to
If honor is still notable, keep your homies tight, that's a hip-hop quotable (Ghost)

I got homies that really ride for me (Ride for me)
Couple of homies that get high wit' me
Get knocked wit' the pie, they gon' lie for me (They gon' lie)
Whole team, they bangin', you can't slide on me (Rrra)

I got plenty of homies that I grew up with
Some still stuck in the past and they shoot up shit
Others still clutchin' the bag that they blew up with
Can't tell your homie your secrets if you don't trust shit
I got a circle of homies that I could send and ride
They pick you up and drop you off like it's enterprise
No plane but I'm a pilot when I let it fly
I got a homie that bang, he threw his pain aside
I got a homie named Bucky doin' a life bit
And he reppin' until they turn off his light switch
D block to the death, we keep a tight clique
A couple felons, ain't no tellin' when they might flip
I got a homie that's crooked but took the straight path
He turned his cooked up base into real estate cash (True)
Now we the realest in the state, you can do the math
Still livin' off experience, that's the illest bath

I got homies that really ride for me (Ride for me)
Couple of homies that get high wit' me
Get knocked wit' the pie, they gon' lie for me (They gon' lie)
Whole team, they bangin', you can't slide on me (Rrra)

Play the game like chess like it's my only move
You got homies? Know how the homies do (Word)
Play the game like chess like it's my only move

Like Q killin' Bishop, I'm the homie wit' the juice
Niggas call me, ""Ghost"", I'm the homie that'll poof
Niggas think they fly, I'm the homie on the roof
Throw your ass off
I'm the homie wit' the chip on the tooth and the shoulder too
I'm the mongoose in the cobra room
I'm the old homie that know the rules
Whoever break 'em all to get broke, shit is overdue
Homie wit' the handgun and the shotgun too
I take a knife fight invite if I got one too
Son soon have an , I got one too
I kill you on my 3,4, , 1, 2
Listen homie, I'm the homie that'll kill you at home
They call me hallway holiday, just leave me alone (Ghost)

No matter the weather it's always cold
If you wanted to be there, you should've rode, now whoevers a rat should'n't of told, but you hop off the porch and put a foot in the Rolls, it's members only, in the members only, brown leather jacket like I'm Jon Voit, but I would never rat on a convoy, I'ma die a gangster and I'ma bring my moms joy, inhale again when the headspin, Ghost float, I probably spoken to dead men, I played Redman then seen red men, laying on the ground after niggas done let the lead spin, the toasters in the safe you put the bread in, fact, it's always a rat that let the feds in, that's why I always light weed with my brethren, if you got smoke well go head bring the meds in
King Buddha (Chorus 2x)
If you got it bring it in
Fuck them bottles if it's finished then roll again
Come with models, tell the models to roll with friends
That's the motto, only smokers can bring it in
Fortes (Verse 2)
Here's why I'm willing to bounce, the devil don't just knock at my door cause he lives in my house, my bars spoke to me, not the bars that I write I'm talking about the bars that the doctor wrote for me, only a few people left got hope for me, and I got this new diesel that ya'll gotta smoke for me, they call me 40 they don't ask me for a gram, we some mothafuckin wolves, ya'll are sacrificial lambs, you fraternize with people that you got nothing in common with, I'm just a hustler with a temper I just wanna flip, I'm at Juices For Life, my whip is double parked, motto is love is love, I need to sip a cup of bark, dip my joint in hash oil, put some keef on it, rather give somebody money than give em some free chronic, got a verse on the track and I made the beat on it, pound like a pillow but I never sleep on it
King Buddha (Chorus 2x)
Styles P (Verse 3)
It's always profit to gain, they say water cleanse the soul but I couldn't wash up the pain, think about the niggas that got the Glock at their brains or the homies in the cells that got locked in the chains, or the fiends in the hood you know they're popping their veins, and the pretty little girls that's only fucking for change, he a boy but he dress like a girl, this shit is strange, on a level do God and the Devil have this arranged? Am I insane or sane light a plane stay fly stay high and maintain, if you in the struggle you probably doing the same, but never sell your soul that shit ruins the game, thought of money and fame when I use to ride on the train, then I got my money and niggas ride in a range, walking on the air how Jordan glide in the lane, yeah the sun don't shine my niggas ride in the rain

Trey On Da Beatz, I hear your my nigga
Ghost
High, fly, shit's crazy, you know?

Sitting in the dark, sipping on the bark
Reminiscing the days when I was dipping on the narks
Pretty bitches in high school, tripping off the clarks
Jordan and Nike head, Perry Ellis jeans
Then I learnt that a sucka nigga come with a jealous gene
If you from the hood then you know what ""whatever"" mean
Some making a movie, some niggas is never seen
I'm like at the record tryna get me a better scene
If the shoe ain't right - Cut
In the telly with mamma tryna dig out a little guts
Hit it from the back while I roll me a big dutch
No smoking in the telly, but I don't give a fuck
I still got the bark shots spillin'
Niggas in the hood either walking or four wheelin'
The shooters get the guns but the hustlers do the dealin'
Move the family to the 'burbs, don't worry 'bout the children

Homie we gettin' money, homie we gettin' high
Homie we gettin' women, homie we gettin' fly
Do this with no effort, homie we don't try
Homie we gettin' rich, homie we gettin' by
Feel me

Usual suspect, when the work hit the dock
The gun jerk first, and then it pop
Rather do the verse devil's ad-libs, then it drops
Got beef with a couple niggas, and the cops
I'm in the pickup truck with cinder blocks
You sweeter than cinnabon, you don't want me to bang your block
Big ditch lit, 
Run a team of bad boys like I'm Harve Pierre
Got classical cost on, Cartier
Watching you watch me, watch you high time
Yeah nigga, fingers to the eye signs
I'm a funny nigga but no joke
Said she was from SoHo, I said so hoe
I just wanna see you up and down like a yo-yo
Dump a bucket on ya head, no polo
Did you come with a crew, are you solo


Style on them niggas like my surname
Hit your girl, left her there, never knew her name
Rappers basketball, I'm dropping fifty, per game
Double digits on the boards, assist too
And I'm on the team with Donnie and big Kiss too
Rocky white, told em, you can't win
Motherfucker I'm cocky, you can't win
Cocksucker, this the mafia that you ain't in
For real


Homie we gettin' money (3X)
Homie we gettin' women (3X)
We do this with no effort, homie we don't try
Homie we gettin' rich, homie we gettin' by (3X)
Homie we gettin' high (3X)

I be in the malls

I'ma tear it
But you ain't gotta be nice
Pass off for parents
44 mag is the last thing you hearing
If the work don't make it, that's a pass interference
Shots of tequila, spending car money at the jeweler
Spending house money at the dealer

Shot hit your knot, and they watch when your head spun
Sucker niggas tell when the feds come
All I know is I get bread; paint a Benz plum, Dodge peach
Spar with the devil, I need a God's reach
Yeah, I lost that one
He touch me, or I bleed, I'mma off that one
I got the DuPont, starin' at the Porsche that come
I'm in the Yukon; I don't mean the truck, I mean the mountains
Meetin' with an account
You know I smoke an ounce while I'm countin'
Buck-forty navigation routin'
Fuck the police; bricks is in the Navigator bouncin'
Slide down the I-9, five on the crime side
You ain't see that big shipment; you on the blindside
You ain't see that six dippin'; we make time fly
Still see them big bags of money in my hindsight
Tear your body up; get your mind right
Blade on your head, like I'm comin' to get your line right
Now up in the 'hood, them give me five mics
Twenty-one gun salute, nod on my fly Nikes
It's the world renowned stoner
Tell ya girl throw the car in the shop, get the loaner
Throw bricks in the shit, make her whip it to Daytona
Swag surf the bitch, yeah I'm throwin' my waves on her
Snapback from Atlanta, I'm throwin' the Braves on her
She already mulin', we throwin' them K's on her
I ain't shit, but you soft like toilet paper
You don't want that home invasion work from the coordinator
And the nigga to act it out
You just rap about the guns, my nigga, I back 'em out

Inner-City Ghost,UnKnown,2015.0,"All these women naked on Instagram
All these men wearin' these women clothes
Listen, love, it's a social site
They got you thinkin' it's a centerfold
Put it in your mental that your body is a temple
But you don't even care 'bout niggas you let into your hand
The pussy free, but the crack cost
Black girl lost, you should know if your man's off
You can tell that it's all wrong when your school likely textin'
The spellin' is all wrong
Forget about the rest like the melon is all gone
No order in the hood like the felons is all gone
I guess they lost the code or forgot about it
They won't help your moms with a bag, that says a lot about 'em
We better teach 'em to stand up
They go straight for the gun, never throwin' they hands up
Won't you think about your family, you really'd man up
I learnt that in the cage
Tried to kill us with crack, tried to kill us with AIDS
This shit is like a book, but you never seein' the page
Inner-city blues got a nigga lightin' the haze
Is it FBI or IRS? Is it DEA or ATF?
Got a nigga sweatin' thinkin', 'Will they take me next?'
I ain't Malcolm, but they about to make me X

Holiday, styles, pinero, well you listen to me
Real niggas feel me, some real nggaz probably won't feel me
But as you know me, I don't really give a fuck
Before I leave I'd like to give a word to the shorties
Despite what I say, despite what you see in the streets
Dspite what you influenced by, the life of crime has many downs
A little bit of ups, and everything you do got consequences and repercussions
So you're best bet better be to stay in school
Hit the books, stay off the streets if possble
To those on the streets, who feel stuck in the game
To those in jail, thats just how shit goes sometimes
We make do wit what we got
To all mc's, poets, lyricists, people such as myself, ghostly individuals
You should listen to my album, and listen and listen and listen
I dont know what i'ma sell or none or that shit
I would say i dont give a fuck but i'd probably be lying
I love to get money and break it down wit my niggas
But in case i don't, the most important thing is respect and honor
And i got plenty of that, so until sheek lou child, next l.o.x. album
And all the mtherfucking rest of the albums we do from the double R
To the d block, to anybody else whose our motherfucking family putting down an
Album, we gon crush yall motherfuckers
Well this one is the ghost, my lil niggas stay outta trouble

Tell your bitch you ain't a pimp, you really a hoe
It's funny how you bluffin them suckers
Only time S.P. is with the cops is in cuffs muh'fuckers
And you should listen up the first moment I spoke
Act up and get shot through your clothing or coat
And now that we back to the hoodies
Extra clips in the footies, have niggas lookin ""Damn how could he?""
Leave them niggas lookin like that
And they ain't no gangsters, they ain't in Queens or Brooklyn like that
Heard niggas made it big time, no lookin back
Me I'm in the streets of Y.O
You would think I'm fucked up too how I creep and ride slow
Then I hit Harlem and the Heights
Got a play dyke before the night (whattup dogs)
White M-6 blue pipin lookin right (aight)
I ain't scared of shit bitch this is my life - get it?
If a nigga steal my chain I feel his pain
But I'ma peel the whole block 'til they squeal his name
S.P. don't play that shit
Ask your boss to try me, you won't okay that shit
Niggas say it's your girl I lay that bitch
Headcracks since we been layin on ADAT bitch

Even the reaper of death is called an angel
A slug to your face will rearrange you
Nigga will straight bang you
Street life will change you
What do you see you close your eyelids
Vampires, lycans and wolves a couple hybrids
And the pigs don’t fit
But the snakes going hiss so the cigs going whiff
And the apes going blast and the whips going splash
And the funny thing about it is the pigs goin laugh
And the raps going eat, so I rap on beats
Before that I had to sell crack on streets
We ain’t playin lil’ homie
That’s the game lil’ homie
Don’t be dumb, living for a name lil’ homie
I did that, now I’m making change lil’ homie
You hungry, but never show your fangs lil’ homie

You tried to diss Kiss to the world
And it's your fault 'cause she said she saw you kissing a girl (mwah)
The hood was behind her for her whole career (uh huh)
But now they slightly starting to disappear (gone)
There's something about that, she's always angry (she's mad)
It might've been when them girls tried to push her scalp back (pa)
Needed some head room...
So she went out and bought Tyson's mansion with eighteen bedrooms (that's right)
She's all domestic bars that don't leave no marks though
You gotta digest the scars, (come on) in fact
Think you better tell her to get back
'Cause every Kiss rap similar to a bitch slap
Too hard since way back in the school yard
She Hollywood though all she need is the boob job (Hollywood)
Girl in the bubble, didn't mean to trouble her
Man but I'm a calico (big Mike), I'm double her
I really think you should tell her to chill cuz (chill)
My résumé's longer than her doctor bill was (ok)
I did a song with Ja Rule biggin' the city up (New York)
She did the Magic Stick remix with Olivia
She got more money but I get busier (uh)
Think somebody is gonna end up killin' her (uh)
But when it's all said and done (yeah)

She had stories of many men (many men), times in the club and niggas that was wanksta but the truth was to see
Bitch ain't shit, she was real good at bluffing it
Ordered protection on the niggas she was fucking with
Now that's a ho that you just can't trust (uh huh)
Hired cops, that's a ho that you just can't touch (uh huh)
Bitch moved out new york when they were swinging them Glocks
Bitch got a deep voice but she would be singing a lot (singing a lot)
Bitch would sell her soul just to get on the charts
Want to front like she's gangsta but she got no heart
And she going to get hit by the mac and
All in the back and this time I bet the jaw will be cracking (ah hah hah)
She's going to get broken to fractions D Block (D Block) is the faction
All I can say is im sorry Ms Jackson (I'm sorry)

We don’t play feat. lloyd banks,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Do the same thing, get the same results
Creepin' like Batman, stronger than The Hulk
Runnin' to the bank teller, dump it for the vault
On my town shit, Ben Affleck
Whole nigga 'cause most men just half-step
I ride hard motherfucker and I ain't crash yet
You don't know or you do know
I'm like Mario Puzo with Cujo
You don't get it, I'm a prolific animal, every verse flammable
Weird like Murdoch, thinkin' like Hannibal
Man like Face but I'm wild like B.A
Bullet to your head when you talkin' to the D.A
Talkin' to the judge and I be in the cab
'Cause I think the car bugged, I don't play with hard luck
Killin' your homeboy, now you call it hard love
Treat you like a blunt how I'm gettin' you sparked up
Nigga, we don't play, we handle problems the worst way
We'll get you shot stabbed, robbed on your birthday
Nigga you ain't got no business 'round here in the first place
Look at everybody chillin', well, fuck that
I'ma play the villain, fuck that I'm here to make a killin'
All money's good money, weed and liquor stealin'
Small money, tall money, nigga we want it all
Left hand on the wheel, other hand on the drawer
Nino icepick through your writin' hand
Heart like a rock, hard to drop like Spider-Man
Park your pretty cars up, hop inside the rider van
Punctuate your lung for a couple hundred dollar stand
Drive of a street lord, knowledge of a college man
Almighty dollars get you dead, make your momma plan
Nuttin' like the sound of dough, I'ma make the commas dance
Numbers jump high numb and drunk in my drama stance
The no fly zone, you don't get a city chance
Show up at your show, make you hoes piss your skinny pants
I'm with Sammy so my haters can't stand me or jam me
I'm runnin' niggas over like Brandy
Motherfuck a Grammy, give me weed and eye candy
Coca-Cola daughter, pussy from a very nice family
Won't last steppin' in the street without the swammy
From Southside to Y.O., niggas die daily
Nigga, we don't play, we handle problems the worst way
We'll get you shot stabbed, robbed on your birthday
Nigga you ain't got no business 'round here in the first place
Look at everybody chillin', well, fuck that
I'ma play the villain, fuck that I'm here to make a killin'
All money's good money, weed and liquor stealin'
Small money, tall money, nigga we want it all
Left hand on the wheel, other hand on the drawer
I'm hard and the problem like algebra
Only use the gun if it's a high enough caliber
You ain't a Dodge car then you ain't no Challenger
Play wit'cha life nigga but you ain't no gambler
Die any day of the week, go get a calendar
Harder than Russian roulette, nigga fuck a Gilette
I take a gun and put a Buck to your neck
Or 50 to your grill, bring the blicky to the hill
These young niggas is buggin', tipsy off the pills
I bring the fire like a motherfuckin' Bic lighter
Paper shredder, eraser to any sick writer
Ghost is Apocalypse, holdin' your esophagus
Runnin' through the shit like a motherfuckin' rhinoceros
Nasty like a hippo is, show you what a sicko is
Barrel to your girl clit, bitch is you ticklish?
You gon' fuck around and get burned like syphilis

Face-Off, niggas gotta ask who is he?
I be in the Benz, high as fuck, playin' Biggie
Pretty bitch, half a brick of yay by her titties
Egg full of dope in her pussy hole
Cops gotta kill me, can't book me though 'cause I ain't doin' time
Got beef with them niggas, I bet you I get 'em lined up
Let it buck and I bet you it's in his spine, my gun
Death Row Records, I bet you I get 'em signed
Not a major deal, but the major steel
I kill your man, then ask you how it made you feel
Shove the blade in you, yeah, the rage is real

Look at me now, doin' what the fuck I'm supposed to do
Me shinin', they sucka niggas emotional
I'm already wavy, just think what the pressure do
Tried to make a quick meal, call it a Lunchable
Hatin' in my comments is somethin' a punk'll do
Them emojis and punctuals'll gon' leave you discoverable
I'm out here chillin' on them back blocks killin' where they crack rock dealin', shit, the trap my buildin'
Lames gettin' money, start shittin' on niggas
Not me, If I'm on, I got positions for niggas
As soon as I got the plug, I shock the shit outta niggas
Kept shit bottled in then blew the lid off them niggas

On the grind, robbed twenty niggas with one nine
Smokin' like a chimney while I'm listening to Biggie
We livin' off experience, my niggas run the city
If we ain't come to talk, shit, we came get busy
And get the guts, meanin' run through it 'til it's empty
That's D-Block style, two hammers and a hawk
No pork, but I eat these rap niggas with a fork
Before I say my Grace, shit, I'm blowin' out your face
Then I'm runnin' in your safe, we the hardest in the state

Started with the work but I had to go cop the baggies
Bricks are in Texas they workin' out like the Aggies
Gave 'em a slice on First Av' like patsies
Uncle in the kitchen, cookin' up, knockin' Patti LaBelle
I could sell if a nigga gotta get it
These in the store, I threw the dubs in my fitted
Explicit, my shit is rated R
Couple shots at your chest, I'm not tryna break your heart
I shake the narcs
A quiet spot, paint a picture for 'em like Basquiat
Feel like Biggie sippin' on private stock,

Hit yo baby moms, embody yo baby father
Proud of couple rappers, they probably yo favorite artists
Fuck is all these charts? A lot of these niggas garbage
From D Block to the Bullpen we the hardest
Still keep that riffle clip loaded, who the target?
I move anything and everything's on the marble
Layin niggas down, roll em up in the coffin
I'm drawin from the waistline, I'm drawin from the arm pit

Every time the D's come and kick in the same door
Alive niggas' time, cut short when they change loads

Seats and the steering wheel

Niggas know to fear the real
There never was a nigga like I
The town that hold me down like I'm big in Bedstuy
Pull it out, cock back, nigga let it fly
Then a nigga gone and a riga red eye
My movement is laudable, my hand in
Any type of handgun seems so compatible
Rappin emphatical, dogs so radical
Pull out the mack so I can rat tat tatter you
Nigga you should leave it at that
I'm a cool fly nigga that get weed in stacks
Driving in a hardtop drop
Couple homies got killed, couple homies got popped
Dumping seven grams cuz the plan don't stop
Like when it's hot in the projects the fans don't stop
I'm in the Lex land with my hand on the guap
Off the end of island, camp 10 on the block
Told you 'bout the fam, just imagine when the shit hit it
Niggas got a pound then you know we getting lit with it
You getting money then stick with it
Pass me the mic, I'm sick with it

Fuck about the plug, he could end up in my man trunk

Grimy niggas will leave you lifeless
All they care about is indictments and the prices

This beat is stupid
Feel like we should have this fucking Premo beat, man
I got ‘em

You ain’t never liked me, nigga, pardon my French
Now I am the shit, you got to pardon my stench
Starting 3, nigga, never the bench
I rock Louch, stay in the trench
I could put my lyrics in the ground and grow you niggas
Hip-hop gym star, I could blow you niggas
Really think about writing a book to show you niggas
But I rather you learn on your own
So who the fuck want to die? Not a lot of shots this accurate
Turn your skin green and yellow like Packers get
Styles say shoot ‘em, not thinking twice
You gon’ hear that shit echo like Greg Nice
Kicking like a fortune teller
Had base on the block by the name of Old Yeller
Now I’m with  way out in Coachella
Donny nigga, Ponzi scheme flow
You’re Adrian Broner, I’m Tyson Riddick Bowe
Take it off safety and let that shit go, nigga

Summer time I'm outside with niggas with pit bulls
I don't smoke the haze if it ain't got the crystals
Look at my eyes you can tell that I'll lift you
I'm in the DB9 when I'm coming to get you
I'm with my Arab man and he holding the missiles
I'm saying fuck all of y'all
If you don't understand let make it real clear
I'm saying what to all of y'all
No more videos or them silly hoes
Riding on your dick when I cut all of y'all

East Coast Ghost ain't no other rapper in the game

Still bring pain
Five more shots than y'all mother fuckers do in that Max Payne game

Niggas only ride in their vehicles
And grind in their blenders
I came home August
Niggas should be happy for the mother fuckin' fact they ain't die in September
Only time I play is when I'm with the kids
When I say I'm spraying the nine that's what it is
And I'm still making heroin sales,plus haze too

Why he in the circle? You know that he won't share
Niggas die in law, you know that that's all rare
Not a gun but a knife, if it's life, you gon' spare

Got 'em loaded up and you know that they all muzzle
Get it figured out and start lookin' for more puzzles
Five different hustles, I'm keepin' them all juggled
Comin' through in Polo, I'm solo holdin' a duffle
The lick came sweet, I blew an L and I chuckled
Thinkin' of the days when I had to bloody my knuckles
Everybody is gettin' murked now
Hard bossin' up when you can't put the work down
Meet the law, but I won't go to church now

Think I'm lyin' to swing iron

Do you think about the crib and the family staying inside
Do you think about the wicked and niggas spraying inside
For acting like you fly when you ain't got wings
In the land of the peasants where we ain't got kings
So I knock Push and get  with it
Cause you say you the king, niggas is in your palace with it
Take your queen from you, that'd get you

Well I used to be, now they talking juice to me
Eatin' right, sets on the bar, nigga sleepin' right
They gon' say I'm evil like  and Osama

Really wanna urine on him
But he's too far down so I put it in a cup and go pour it on him
Hit him with the blade from the carpenter
Always stay on point like a pencil in the sharpener

Fuck about your whip, I pop you up at the stoplight
You saying what you like, I could tell you what you not like
You not nice, you not real

Holding on the Glock, still

Unless you giving money out, something like the lottery
Plant you like some weed, or some motherfucking pottery
Whoever said they was hard, nigga, you owe a fucking apology
Old head, young head
Yeah, it's blue steel, but I could make the gun red
Stick it in your guts the second after I pump lead
Cocksucker, disgusted with it
Holler back, nigga, if you was fucking with it
Yeah, you got a gun, but you pussy and you ain't bucking with it

That business money is great

Little spot off the Gulf Coast, duplex on the outskirts
I know your bitch on the rag
But I don't really sweat it cause I know that her mouth works
Tell your clique suck dick when I outburst
Smokin', reminiscin' on movin' that down-south work
Have you ever seen a nigga bleed?
You was just rappin', lyin', smokin' your weed
I was in the trenches with niggas that got to eat
Been to funerals with mothers that got to weep
Had to stay awake with niggas that need to sleep
I would lose a arm for some niggas that's knee-deep
If you feelin' (-), fuck it, you got to leave
Ghost stay cool, but you know that I got the heat
Lower the handguns, say a long prayer
Sat at the mirror, gave a long stare
Feel it comin' and the night is the wrong air, outside anyway
Weigh a buck-eighty and whatever the semi weigh
A dollar bill weigh much less than a penny weigh
So you was talkin' heavy, I fucked with the featherweights

Then they get killed you wonder where did their life go
The block Got Perico
Lightin up discussing them niggas that got the rico
Just copped the 45, shit lookin lethal
Waiting for the stick-up kids or enemies to creep through
Leave them niggas see-through
Why is the hood so evil
A few good niggas but we lost those people
All up in the mix like the Kool-Aid and the sugar is
Lookin' at the block tryin' to figure how hood it is
Bricks in the bookbag, wonder how good it is
You could ask the fiends in a few
See the cars and the cash and what dreamin' can do
Watch them little dirty niggas that be schemin' on you

You felt pain if you lost joy
Can't please a wolf with a dog's toy
You got beef, bring it to the source, boy
When Achilles killed Hector, he lost Troy
You're forewarned 'bout the four pound
Catch a 'em in a four by four, give 'em four rounds

I was out there for the money if it wasn't the love
On-site every night, that's the life of a thug
Ran up every day gettin' tight with the plug

Get the lighter, I got fire, I'm about to get buzzed
It's inhaled then it's held in
If I ain't goin' to Heaven, I go to Hell then

Am I Heaven sent or Hell bent?

Come through the North side in a boss ride
Shout to the West and the East side

Can God cleanse my soul with the rain drops?
I don't go to church, will it work, will the pain stop?
Used to blow weed, get the money out the 'caine spot
If you from the ghetto, you probably done heard a thang pop
Seen it jump, it ain't stop, can't stop, won't stop
That was three stops but we keep goin'
I like to smoke, I pre-roll 'em
The lab life, I keep flowin'

‘Cause I’ve been putting pressure on errything lately
And I’m here pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that being said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of yall it’s no courtesy
I’m not a ? none of you burden me
Next generation at the double R lights up
Ii’m the next nigga that’s gon’ make ‘em throw they bikes up
I literally had million’s watching me
On the stage turning dudes to a mockery
Get it, copy with me with no ?
This niggas is chickens and beef steady talkin’ bout they go HAM
You confused you meat lover
I got Swizz feelin’ like Dre when he made Deep Cover
I’m the next Double R meal ticket
Make like a deck of cards nigga, deal wit’ it!


My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull on the Phantom when you see a don in it
Glove box you might see the Kuran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong with it
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relay my bars and remastered every one
Nigga’s wonderin’ where the fuck Drag at?
I’m on Twitter hittin’ everybody back
Drag to the dash I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came wit’
If I had to do it all again, I wouldn’t change shit

Porsche or Range Rover meet me in the ride
Windows on jet black you ain’t gotta hide

Nice blue jeans sitting on the Louie

Hater seen Sheek nope, Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll

But it ain't no rush, niggas is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it’s time for the blood to get spilled
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed

She can call time, running trio on ya bitch
Shoot ‘em in the mouth, bet you he ain't gon snitch
F-ckin’ with 3 bad niggas
Telling your girl full of tea bag niggas

ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money mansion Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, OG, crack babies

The gun ain't big enough, you can fit it on your waist
I'm thinkin' of money, when my thumb is on the safe
Pointy finger on the trigger
Cops show a picture, there's no pointin' at a nigga
A dead man can't move
And the shooter might be, but the lead ain't smooth; take it easy
Cocaine bamboo-colored; got your girl on my hair like shampoo, brother
And the gun's titanium, handle's rubber
You expired; just got cancelled from us
What up!?

Don't put 'em down til' I tell you
Whoever wanna be hard-headed'll find out what the shell do
Now you can put 'em down if when you want",https://genius.com/Styles-p-this-moment-lyrics
Daddy Get That Cash (Feat. Lil Mo),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lil' Mo, holla at me
Get that cash daddy
If it's you versus me, think about it
They gon' yell my name when they announce the winner
And I ain't 'bout to sell much
I got my honeys on the plane but the birds flyin' south for the winter
Don't get ya self familiated
I'm so gangsta that, just knowin' myself makes me affiliated
What chu think honey hold 'em hammers for?
So she can spend 10 cent at Jill Sander store?
We gon' hit Rodeo Drive, drive on Beverly Hills
Though I love her, so I'm spendin' like 70 bills
 keep ya payroll big
Light a blunt and just beg me to chill
Ain't a player but my life is real all of the time
So she went and copped a gun a 'lil smaller than mine
That's a down ass chick and she keep it real
So I'ma keep it real back all of the time
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Daddy go and get that cash
Go and get the black suit, grab the burner plus get that match
She said, ""Tell me where you goin""
It's no doubt that I'm comin' in 'cause she could fit a little 9 or a 22
Right inside her bra or Calvin Klein underwear
Mami you could stay home and bag up the work
I'm just goin' out to play chrome or nag up a jerk
If I kiss her then her heart'll melt
Listen dogg, you don't understand the work
That she carry in the garter belt
No doubt I love her, I'ma tell you the truth
But don't get it fucked up and get fucked up
Only thing sweet about P is his tooth
And she could sleep with another dude
She gon' tell me where the safe at
The coke at, how to rob his mother too
Daddy go and get that cash
That's what my honey holla'd out every time I hit that ass
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Since you helped daddy get that cash
Get the condom and the mink and the ring and the gift wrapped Jag
And you still got the bomb ass, I pay the phone and the rent
But keep it real boo, you pay the Conair
If I get knocked, she in the B I room
With some money on my books, give weed to a nigga
And don't worry about shit, 'cause I be out soon
No doubt that's my Booby-cat
She drop my bricks off right on Broadway
Then she go and get a doobie wrapped
Lookin' at the God, like we all a little
One pop for the pasta, one pop for the coke
Holiday Styles, dick one shot for the door
And it's sorta like we Bonnie and Clyde
I load the ooby up, she gon' roll the booby up, then mami abide
And she said, ""Daddy get that cash""
She know I would but had no idea that I would skip that fast
Daddy gotta get that cash
(I'm goin' ta get it, I'm goin' ta get it)
Daddy gotta get that cash

One More Step,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ciphers in front of The Apollo as a shorty
Now I got a clip full of hollows in the.40
Louis, Guccis, every now and then Mauris
I take too long to come back, send for me
Know how to work it, big things pop on the underground circuit
Maintain 'til it surface
The nerve of these peasants
Treat a rap budget like a bird how I stretch it
Think they get the message
Waters, Dutchies, lot of herb in a session
So-called tough guys, herbs with aggression
Put your thoughts all over the curb with the Wesson
What used to be superb now is depressing
Negative energy
Generated from the snakes and the centipedes
You will remember me
I just get the storm started
Cold-blooded, warm-hearted
Either way you on target
Move to the side, let the lane merge
The gun's like fried rice, who want they brain stirred?
Enter the limelight, lemon drop-top off of crime life
Always see the crew in the hindsight
Yeah!
American sedan, the shooters got Berettas in their hand
This is Mafia, veterans'll plan
Word to the tape on the brick, this is raw
I'm in the 4x4, 8 plus 8 in the clip
The hustling Harry Potter, shaking the brick
Ice in the bracelet give the Matrix a glitch
And my car's like a spaceship
Got gold in my Nike checks
Jordans got ice in the laces
Pants got a gun where the waist is
It's basic, shirt smell like herb smoke
Chirp, yo, Chirp back
Let me know who getting murked, though
Yeah, we getting money, nigga
Who getting work, though
And I got the Kush, nigga
I got the Purple, move squares
'Cause we got a hold on the circle
Kill you or hurt you, whatever's a virtue
Beat you like ya parents when you breaking your curfew

Homie, live life to the death
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Get this money, it don't matter if it's cash or check
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
Big houses, cars and jewels that's wet
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step
To the family, friends, whole life is set
We gonna make it to the top, just one more step, one more step
Yo, living my life, what's left of it
Don't try to go to jail but if you do make the best of it
If you crash into a bullet then it ain't no estimate
It's a money-back guarantee, my nigga
Death's a definite
This is audio crack, guess who's cheffing it
Jadakiss and SP, do this effortless
Gun play make you do whatever son say
If the Lord send you a flight, the ticket is one-way
Put that work in when you young, you get power
The money don't match the running it get sour
Still rep the hood to the death
A promise is only good if it's kept
Niggas'll kill you for less
Silence is golden, go 'head, keep dozing
The window of opportunity keeps closing
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small, but a casket is much smaller
Burn out 30 a set shit, 60 a Key shit
That's street shit, Jada & P shit
Lambos, hoopties, shooters and groupies
Montclair, D-Squared, Emilio Pucci
Long trips, short trips, making me nauseous
Court shit, gave them Jews money for Porsches
Made a couple mil for the small shit
We rap and keep raw, so we on some street lore-Forbes shit
Wall still spin, upgraded the floor flip
Ain't touch it, ain't see it, ain't hear about it
If it's money gone, believe we gon' care about
Send some niggas to your crib, take the air up out it
Leave some blood up in it
Listen, fam, the Lam's the color of toast
The seats is like butter in it
No hammers in the club, box cutter in it
Long money and big checks
Get popped in the chest, face, wig, neck
Tre Pound, Sig, Tec
Play the game, get a plane is ya ship wreck

From the first to the third, know the strip for crooks
And the fifteenth too, I got sixteens too
I ain't goin' to sleep, I got big dreams too
Crib wit' a escalator and two more floors
Pretty girls, it's sawed-offs and four-doors

If you maintain what's in your lane then you'll remain
Real niggas told 'em
These are the things that we obtained within the game
Got my bitch by my side though, ready for the ride flow
Different whips, switch, we equipped for the 5-O
Checkpoint, skip the checkpoint, no deal
Halfway, fuck a rest stop, no chill

Raised in the ghetto, you'll forever be poor
Teach it to the cops, say you'll never be shit

Keys to the crib,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I got them ki’s in the crib
You wouldn’t find them if you had the keys to the crib
Them niggas cheesing, it’s real
It ain’t cheese if it’s less than a mil’
I think I’m losing my religion
Praying on these niggas, wrap a kilo in a ribbon
Live every day like it’s my last
My only trending topic is the cash

I see no nigga in these clear Gazelles
Bitch-ass nigga, better get some mail
I’m riding in a 6 like this bitch for sale
That boy Meek Mill squeeze clips for real
See me in the street, rose-gold everything
Moving like hoes got me plotting on your team
Learning your whereabouts, burners to air ’em out
Bitches a motion picture, I’m picturing Paramount
Riding in the Lotus, Teflon Don
With an ambitious bitch, lotus flower bomb
Wale on burn, young nigga’s doing numbers
Double M G got it the next ten summers
I’m trying to do it big forever
Keys to the crib, and I’m with whatever
Ki’s to the crib, nigga, bricks wherever
Hundred mil’ plus til we rich forever


I see no nigga in these red Gazelles
All I see is women with these massive tails
All I see is young’uns with this trash to sell
They got some CO’s that get you hash in jail
Little dope, little coke, talking cash for real
Funeral’s never cool, nigga, pass the steel
I’m a guru in the kitchen, whipping mass appeal
Boobie got a life sentence on his last appeal
That’s one of few names that’ll last for real
Got me drinking from the bottom, no glasses filled
Always purple in the cup, nigga, pass the pills
I’m the first one here to fuck, snatch your ass for real
Keys to the crib, boys, keys to the V
If you at the table, then you eat what I eat
Breathe what I breathe, drink what I drink
Smoke what I smoke and we still mink for mink


Ki’s in the crib, you want keys to the crib
I got work from Argentina and Belize in the crib
Homie holding a nina, could sneeze him a brick
Knee-deep in the cocaine, trees in the six
Biggie on the stereo, seven-digit flips
This is the scenario – something go wrong, it’s a burial
Hit the hood, watch it go around like a merry-go
White seats, new M5, all cherry though
Heard you at Aces, Courvoisier, toasting the niggas that beat cases
Knowing your connect on a name-to-name basis
Eating with your fam on a day-to-day basis
Weight shit, get the big house and the spaceship
Team of lawyer niggas
That’ll fucking boil niggas for a chain or a bracelet
Nigga, you know I’m living fly
For the love of the game, I put a ribbon on the pie


If I’m rich now, is it too much to pray to be rich forever?
Forgive me Lord! Forgive me
My next move; God Forgives, I Don’t
I think you’ll love it

It ain't the money, it's respect that make you man of the men""

Straight bodies, no slipping, no court for them niggas
Suck my dick is the only words I offer them niggas

It's a new day and age, when I die throw  in my grave
And tell my niggas in the cage I wasn't able to save
Sometimes the streets get the best out of men, they got a cell for you
Crackers tryna stretch out the pen, I go to hell for you

Live up in the hotel, hangout where the G's at
Where the B's and the C's at?
You fall back, or you ease back
But a real homie'll rise up
Think of the 4-4 long, you got me sized up
I'm too old for the dumb shh-
Cold for the numb shh-
Hand on the gun grip
The top down with the blunt lit
Flying, thinking of hundreds
I'm in the juice game and the book game
But I'm still rapping, got my mass and my cook game
It's midnight but we 730
We legit, but forever dirty!
So even if I'm thin, G
That old sweatsuit, got a pocket full of them Benjies
I want a goose neck in the benzie
Still feel the pain from the cocaine frenzy
80s, 90s and 2Gs, knew I was too G, listened to Kool G!
No gun or knife then I'm throwing the two piece
Cop me a new pair of kicks if my shoes crease
Lines and holes, just like a loose leaf
Dope lines, bullet holes, homie, is you sleep?
Yeah, you better wake up then, you ain't gettin it
Get a job, cake up then!
If the nine don't work, throw the eight up then
I'm a crooked dude, but I'mma tell you straight up then
Yeah, we both rap but you know that the ghost trap

Don't fuck wit' me
You know me
Told ya
Oh boy

Stop schemin' and lookin' hard
I'm from D-Block, I ain't got no body guard
I used a shotty, God
It ain't New Orleans but I throw the mask on like it's Mardi Gras
Tip of the ratchet hotter than tamales, y'all
I'll kill any rapper, I'm sorry, y'all
I'm on Koch and I'm indie, please don't offend me
Drive drunk like Lindsey, think about the Benjis
Hurt me, niggas from the hood they revenge me
Loved by the greasy, the grimy, the dingy
Ridin' in the hooptie, tank damn near empty
Me on a mixtape, whole car shitfaced
Hoodie'd up, ridin' to the club to get the shit straight
Lord knows what the hood'll do for a big face

Still think I can't see 'cause the way my hoodie sittin' on the top lip?
Know that I came with the cocked fifth, we dolo
Cocky, obnoxious, waitin' to pop clips
If it don't come to the guns, got the Gym Star from under the tongue to under his chin
Now that's the type of jungle we in
Ask the apes and the lions, I keep my hand taped to the iron
The transporter taped to the client
Leave nigga's thinner than a grapefruit diet
You could pray to Jesus cryin'
I'm wilder than Babe Ruth riotin' and seis coupe flyin'

And lookin' hard, look-lookin' hard
Stop-stop-stop schemin' and lookin' hard
Stop schemin'-stop schemin' and look-lookin' hard

The hood got shootings, stabbings, kidnaps, grabbings
Bricks in the cabinets, the hallway's a hazard
You could get shot by a real young bastard
Can't see the game but they money's like glasses
Now you see the whole world, got a lil' old girl
Get off the P's and Q's the minute that your toes curl
Fiends is fienin', you cookin' hard, gettin' paper

Guns bust, keys wrapped
Fuck niggas never bothered me
Favourite four words, this is a robbery
Next few words could be
Pardon me, that was an artery
I don't know who the fuck started me
You think you nice? I wonder who lied to you
You butter, I'ma knife, I slide through you
You think you lying where you live I'll ride to you
Just one deep, not crew deep
Put three holes in you, just like a loose leaf
Or a bunch of holes in you, just like a kufi
If you know God or the devil, introduce me
It's the Ghost brother
Get treated like a big bag of weed and get motherfuckin smoked brother
Cut the dumb shit, 'cause I run shit
You can get harmed when my palm's on the gun grip
All I want is millions, thousands and hundreds
""I made millions from entertainment""
I'm money hungry, who's serving?
We can go to war like the spartans and the persians
Riding in suburbans with the couches and the curtains
Who's ruthless? I know I am
Make you sniff uncut dope out of Thailand
Can't see the God from the lens out the sky cam
Play the five ride or the six ride
Get the baking soda tell em boys let the bricks fly
Keep the bar buzzed and the piff high
Put you on the ground cause I ain't letting shit fly
Too many fake niggas, with their fake ice
Talking fake shit, you got a fake life
'38 in your mouth, tell me what the taste like
See me stop, like you just seen grave lights
Get gassed nigga, that's your ass nigga
50 cent gem star watch how I slash niggas
From the forehead to the adam's apple
I'ma battle man, you a battle rapper

I got this shit (December 19th)
I ain't the hardest on the street for no reason (DJ Drama)
I mean a lot of niggas say they hard, I just don't believe them (Pay attention)
(Let's go poobs)

I don't want attention, benz truck with the stocks on em
I don't wnana beef but if he riff let it pop on him
Dump him in the river with the cement blocks on him
Thought he knew the time I swear to God he had a watch on him
I guess that'll make him the dumbass
You can say he fucked cause the gun gonna cum fast
Shit or it might be the hawk
But I'mma cut his lips off if I don't like when he talk
Whatever the Bentley cost I paid the price in the court
Yearly, life's a bitch I still love her dearly
Let my gun talk these dumb niggas don't hear me
If it's on then the tech gon' rattle
No sleep more beef than the Texas cattle nigga
But I don't need no branding iron
Hardest in the world and you can't deny him
If you try then the whole fuckin' family dyin'
I'm a wolf so the motherfuckin' lands be cryin'
What up nigga can I howl at the moon
Get bricks in December, give em out to my members
And tell them motherfuckers wild out til June
About to get the lamb drop style real soon
Nah, cause I'm a little low key
I knew I was a G when I was drinkin O.E
Wasn't shootin 5s was shootin 9s you niggas know me
If it's a harder motherfucker I want you to show me
You don't like me, fuck you, y'all niggas could blow me
I'm the hardest in the street, cocksucker you owe me
Cause I really robbed niggas and I really sold Ds

I ain't Lil' Jon but I get crunked on a nigga
Far from Kriss Kross but I will jump on a nigga
You fuckin with the right ones, somebody warn this nigga
Your face on the white tee, whole hood mourning nigga
It's bully bitch still black glove hoodie man
Still give you nightmares, sorta like the boogieman
Holla at Perdue, a lot of your dudes just waitin
Flows been watered, nicknamed polar springs
Niggas need work, shit, I can pull a couple strings
Still using small scales down to them triple beams
Problem with the kid, I'm jumping out the black Tahoe
Two black Chargers, a Range that follows
All vested up with them clips filled with hollows
Put that on my life that you won't see tomorrow

I'm with the Fantastic Four so y'all niggas is doomed
Old western style nigga, I roll with them goons
Me and SP can see yall niggas at high noon
I still see a lot of y'all runnin  round actin off
Like I wouldn't tap your frame, cough and you're actin boss
I'll whoop you out like the Passion of Christ do

It's from around, you know the shooter round
4-5 filled with arrows to put you through the ground
You makin it rain, you throw loot around
Your mom got a dress, hope yo pop got a suit around
Get a candle to circle the whole crew around
Find a nice little spot to boohoo around

But I'll set the standard for G that they live to
Listen boo, I ain't tryin' to kid you
I'll tell you what it do and what it did do
And then tell you what you gon' do
Hit this drink and blunt right in front of you
Better hope I don't front on you

I Get Money,The Phantom Menace,2007.0,"I got it
I got it
I got it, nigga
I run the hood
I got it
I got it
I got it

What up?
Don't listen to the hook, listen to the crook
I got the hoodie and the mask on coming for the jooks
If I ain't got shit, but a pocket full of lint
Got a fully loaded 45, hooptie with the tints
Nah, I get money, money I got
If not, I have some when I get off your block
Like jail you could piss off or get off the pot
We rob your whole crew, you won't even get off a shot
Ain't a Blood but I get red, dickhead
I throw the gun to your bitch head like, ""Open the safe""
If she don't, you won't believe how I open her face
Cut her up, throw her body parts all over the place
A little man wanna fuck her them cum in her asshole
I'm thinkin', ""Why I even give a gun to this rascal?""
Now you don't want no type of hassle
You the king 'til the Ghost run-up in your castle
Know I'm gonna load it up
Point 'em out, I'll hold 'em up
Like a newborn baby, I fuck around and throw 'em up
Nine mil shiny, little man behind me
Fuck about rap, nigga, I'm still mad grimy
Like cash but I ain't multi
Got a new blade, neck need a new bowtie
The lil' mama like, ""Daddy, why you get so high?""
We stay grounded and rob niggas to get so fly
Feel me
'Bout to rob these niggas of rap
What up to my niggas who cap, I got my mind on crack
Or my mind on gats
Run up on the kid, I'ma cock it back
I'll put your little spine on lap
Now the Ghost probably smokin' the roach blunt
Team of little grimy niggas to listen and do what the coach want
Now I get money, money I got
I let the shotgun go on your block
What up?

Only talk what I live, y'all
Real shit, old fashioned bars these niggas ain't able to give y'all
Take it back like Velours and Diadors
We amor, the 4 5th and the 44
I ain't gotta tell you I get it, 'cause you know I got it
Risk my freedom to get what I got in the closet
Far as what I got in the bank came from a few rhymes that I had in the tank
If I ain't have the burner on me then I had me a shank
In the cut, with a Dutch 'bout to have me a drank
That's two hundred on the dash, the engine is funny
I'm swimmin' in money, nigga
Still spendin' Benjaman money
I could drop with a royal flush on 'em
My moon men in Grammys got dust on 'em
Please, look
They illin', trust me
J chillin'
But still got crack in the Section 8 villa
Put your money on 'em, bet I blow 'em away
And I don't even wash clothes, I just throw 'em away
I just had 50 p's, let 'em go in a day
These other niggas just talkin', I could show them the way
I'm from the Reagan era, way before Bush came
And the juice came in the same package the Kush came
Trained to snuff a nigga, I ain't with the push games
I been getting money from back then, what your name?

I got it
I got it",https://genius.com/Styles-p-i-get-money-lyrics

Checks get cut after the clearance
What we dealin' with is hard work and perseverance
Still send a nice ransom note to your parents
I'ma ride this bitch 'til it needs some ball bearin's
Tryin' to renovate the West wing of the mansion
I ain't thinkin' recession, I'm thinkin' expansion
I be in the malls, I don't be in the Hamptons
And I'm playin' the wall but my chain is dancin'
More than 200 on the dash, I'ma tear it
You ain't gotta be nice to pass off appearance
44 mag is the last thing you hearin'
If the work don't make it that's a pass interference
Shots of tequila, shops spendin' calm money at the jeweler
Spendin' house money at the dealer
Double bag the piff 'cause the sour need a sealer
You wanna see a real nigga I just look into the mirror

Still dope money in the gray mink all day

Street Sh*t,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Among evil gods I sleep
Their ancient hymns were my dreams
But the vast and cold forest beckons
So I rose with the funeral moon
From my coffin of blackest slone
From the crypts which for aeons
Embraced me
Through the portals and into the
Frozen night
It's calling for me
In darkness reborn
Through the midnight spheres I dance
Spreading my wings
Caressing the black infernal night
""From a timeless past I have risen to
Rule this kingdom of mine""
The eye of the wolves will guide me
Through landscapes of ancient black
I am eternal, I am supreme
I ride the nocturnal winds
Thy cry of ravens will carry me
Forth dimensions unknown by mortals
I am eternal, I am supreme
The nocturnal winds are mine
I descend into forests long forgotten
The naked trees united in perfect
Melancholy
And I saw spirits dancing
Swirling insane
The knowledge revealed to me
In darkness reborn
Through midnight spheres I dance
Spreading my wings
In the forest of pernicious black
Night is eternal
The sun is forever consumed
Embraced by the beautiful blackness
So sombre, so pure",https://genius.com/Styles-p-street-sht-lyrics
The Music Sucks,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The music sucks and that's a genuine truth
When you're not around I feel that nothing is good
Probably it's a fact and probably it's not
But when I'm not an asshole I think you love me a lot
Despite my bad character, despite my forked tongue
You need an explanation and so I write a song
I told you you're the best one and even you're the one
So here's the only exception and keep it well in mind because
I DO CONTROL UNTIL I CALL I TRY TO HANG, BUT THEN I FALL
IF HATE'S A PLACE, I'M GOING TO I NEVER HAD/LOVED SOMEONE LIKE YOU
I stand to the fact that you're sick at home
I stand to the fact that you want to be alone
I stand to the fact you don't like me saying so
I can't stand to the fact I don't like music anymore
I won't lose you or no one would believe I have a brain
So here comes the romance and here comes the pain
If you love me sweet darling I won't bound myself in fog
Hey kiss me sweet princess I am not that bad as frog",https://genius.com/Styles-p-the-music-sucks-lyrics

The stick in your eye and you just don't like me

It is so warm and clean, with multicolour screen
It feels like holidays in Baghdad town

I see my videotapes, I see them everyday

I WANNA GIVE YOU SOME PLEASURE

Love gritty chicks, real hoodie chicks
You know what I need 'cause I'm an idiot
Brains and the money machine 'cause I'm gettin' it
Did call me miracle man 'cause I'm whippin' it

'Bout a thousand a bottle for the Richard Hennessy
Just pay for it, heaven sent

Told you that I'm sittin' on it somethin' like a chair

I'm the last gangster left, it's so crazy
It's impostors, it's no shocker
If that shit come in a can it ain't lobster
If that boy come with a guard he ain't a mobster

And fly too high for the Skycam
Club to the Benz to the telly short time span

Window stretch floor to the ceiling, big view

Don't you know that I'm a terrorist?
