Palm Trees,BetterOffDEAD,2013.0,"So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

Lions don't lose sleep over the 'pinion of sheep
On the road to the riches, money sticking to my cleats
I am moi, magnifique,
 skin noir, Darky Meech
Niggas with the most opinions usually have the least
It's funny how now rappers be on their druggy shit
Downloaded my tape, sat back, studied shit
Acid pack a hundred hits, shroom caps and hash bricks
Trippy like that Destiny Child chick on 106
This white bitch had the fucking nerve to call me a nigga
When she the one paying the surgeon for her lips to get bigger
Do you get the bigger picture? Shit is backwards, my nigga
You sneak dissing, taking jabs, get your boxing on
Cause you ain't get the word, I'm Glock Lesnar in the octagon
This shit is straight absurd, do not hate me cause your life is shitty
I show no pity, you turd, 
you better off in the dirt
Now you better off dead, like the title of my work

So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

Every day; me and Mary Jane
You might say I'm addicted, 
but me, I'm truly lifted
Stoned so loud, you can hear me in the crowd
Smoking girl scout,
 
sour by the ounce
Mary never cheat me
Mary not a backstabbing bitch that'll lie and deceive me
Spread it even, even, hash wax in the evening
Dab or die trying,
 on the road to Zion
Damn, they try and stick me for my paper
They trying to take me under, I've seen it through the vapors
Jealous ones still envy, 
got a couple real with me
And my bitch will talk some shit and smoke the kil' with me
Meech will hide the body, enough of that though
They saying talk is cheap, so I'll be smiling when we meet
They screaming ""Zombies!"" out in England
But I'm on the block with Mary, pushing and dreaming
Ah ah ah, I'm feeling myself
Thizzle, fo' shizzle, my nizzle, spitting riddles on instrumentals
Trippy life, blotter in the night
Fill my appetite (Fill my appetite)

So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)

Could be your mans, or be your fan, or be your kin
Pay your dues, man, I gotta choose, whether I lose or win this
Foe or friend, can't determine the difference
The instance they see you peaking, they pussy be leaking fluid
My nigga, what is you doing, all black in the back of a Buick
I'm proving I'm sadistic as sin, as I'm making murderous music
We don't rep the same things, nah, don't bother confuse it
So much stressing on my brain, momma think I'ma lose it
Human vagabond, hoes that stow they panties in my carry on
Why you hating niggas acting nonchalant (Honest, brah)
Fuck your publication that say I'm a third wheel
Architect build your mind,
 set stress but won't swell
Oh yes, I smoke kill, 
I'm crack, you smoke krills
I pack, you dope deal, in fact, I'm so chill
I'm never off the pivot,
 six stitches to your image
Not offended when you call me genius, all that means is

So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees
So when you throw shade, it could never harm me
(So when you throw shade, it could never harm me)
So much grams, unzip the bag
Dip in my hand, then I palm trees

Get M-E-T-H-O-D, 
Drought 3
, Dwayne Carter
With a splash of Busta's craft and a hint of Big Poppa
Little dash of Nasty Nas, top it off with Bob Marley
Throw 'em all in a blender and I'm what the fuck you get
And imagine that like a figment
I'm a walking, talking enigma
Something you never figure
Ni-ni-ni-ni-nigga, I am like Randy Savage on acid
That's very vibrant and classic
A walking disaster, hazard to any rapper
That’s rapping, we the underground killas
But globally they feel us cause we restoring the feeling
This guru spit voodoo, yes
I am that mass appealing,
 
I'm feeling up on her breasts
She swallowing all my children
, ha
Rack in my mouth, teeth made of gold
I'm sucking the areolas, my nigga, the best of both
Double entendre
And if they auctioning niggas, then I'm the top product
What am I saying, they used to auction our forefathers
Where is my mind, shit, I can't find it
Like looking for remote control after smoking marijuana
How is he so niggerish, yet so enlightened
It can't be possible, he living everything he rhyming
I feel like we entered the game with remarkable timing

Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga
I made more than I can fit in this quote, nigga
Quote, nigga,
 we the hope, nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga

I assemble sentences so I can reap the benefits
And I never see my nemesis, but I'm working on my penmanship
I counted many blessings, stressing women, nothing less of winning
If I'm talking shit, shit, man, I'm only kidding
Sitting on the sphere, Earth is spinning, persevere
2012 is here and instill a different kind of fear
It's material, and I ain't talkin fashion
Believe in what you want, cause no one knows to seem what happens
Ya bastards
Since I smoked the cohiba, I'm evil
Zombies be competition, 
six feet deep beneath your people
Only illegal amounts of the medicine'll get you in a bind
I already got your heart, girl, I wanna fuck your mind
But since I came,
 
developed my name,
 the author oughta slap you hard
I never drop the acid, bruh, I'm trippy as fuck
Because I'd rather knock it down instead of picking you up
So cut the ash right through the diamond,
 my hair wrapped up like a shaman

Broke niggas only make jokes, nigga
I made more than I can fit in this quote, nigga
Quote, nigga,
 we the hope, nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga
Hope nigga, hope nigga
Flatbush Zombie, motherfucker, we the hope, nigga

Cruising down the street, ain't got a 6-4
Just a heart full of pride, a mouth full of gold
Corny baby mama knocking at my front do'
She just want my income, I'd rather get my dick sucked
I be that Z-O-M-B, shawty don't tempt me
Leather on, Fonzirelli, piss on women, R. Kelly
Smashing bitches in the telly, passing swishers rolled up with me
Trippy is as trippy does, catch me smoking potent, cuz
Having visions of Mason Betha coming back
Spitting crack, contemplating how we living under Satan
Discriminating and hating, this ain't rap
I call it food for the savoring
What's your craving, na-not for paparazzi, 
the most
Incredible dope, feta, cheddar, the revenue
Never seen federal, gotta stay 'head of the server, the Hedetet
Love my medical-hating niggas disguised as friends
I see the lies, wannabes, little Gs
Peep the A-P-Cs,
 I'm a G-O-D
Rep the N-Y-C,
 
we got U-N-I, T-Y
It's time y'all get off my N-U-T-Zs, please
I got the scoop, ain't that about a bitch
Take a flick with the microphone ripper, gravedigger

Woah woah huh

YSL pants with the zippers—yikes!
Met her this evenin', 'ready hit it, twice
Tag on your soul everybody got a price
Acid, acid, change yo' life
Bape if she hip, Saint Laurent if she bougie
I'm faded like Boosie
She call me Meechy over, I slide in that coochie
Nosedive in that coochie
My dick is big, it should be wearin' a Coogi
I’m in Nice of France
Tie-dyed my lifestyle
Even bleached the pants
Next week Japan
Thom Browne bubble lens, eyes need the tint
Flatbush, Brooklyn, from the County of Kings
Run up on me like I'm some hippie nigga
And die under the knife, Joan Rivers
Ooh, damn, that punchline delivers
Hold up wait a minute, moment of silence
Hm, fuck it
Let's get back to wylin'
Blood on your Timbs, Shoot Shoot
Blood at your limbs, tuh tuh
Slugs hit your rims
Ambidextrous, I shoot with two hands
Even got blood on your friends
I think I just flooded the Benz
Damn it, baby, Meechy's at it again
M-M-Murder, murder, murder
Capital M with two gats in my hand

Everyday a nigga wake up, got to blaze a little chronic
Thank the universe, a blessing, new day, a new dollar
Middle finger to my niggas and my bitches two times
Representing for my niggas in the hood it's no ceiling
Sellin', trappin' like a villain, cold
Should've made a killing, go
Finger played with it, yo
Nigga stay with it
Hate a nigga, fade him quicker now
Numb dum diddy dum 
I, I, I, I, I
High like the sun
Fetch a frequency, this ain't shit to me
She said she got a friend, then let my nigga beat
Meech roll 'em, bust 'em, cannons, wooh
Spliff long looking like a Manson
I'm on acid feeling like the Hamptons
She feeling freaky beat the pussy like a champion
Young nigga but I'm still O.G
Supreme Team like 1993
Triple 6 on my coffin, I dance with the devil
Came back with a vengeance, Christ off the hinges
I'm nice with the spit kid, twice as much vicious
Psycho-active, I'm on a mission
Electric Kool-Ade
Make your decision
You want it, I get you
These niggas ain't right, they can't write they own shit
But they smile in your face, and they claim they the shit
But to me a disgrace
Trying to keep steps ahead like we running a race
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make
Free my niggas lawd, made it right today
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make

Not a thug but niggas know how I keep mine
Call her up or quick to throw up the peace sign
Throw that pussy, let me hit it
Girl, I got to get it
Saying she got a feeling, she let a young nigga hit it
Back and forth cause we smoke them seven grams
Real boss shit I don’t expect you to understand
My performance, dreams at 14
Now I hear them calling two to their seats
Won’t slip away this is serious business
Voidin the mischief while spending these Benjamins
Surrender potential pussy to me
Brought to you by the ungrateful police
Conscious keep telling me, beautiful melody
Will exhibit if I trip on the L.S.D
Nah, window for money and dro
Some people think I spend money for show
Spending show money
Flip like aerobics
Components will kill my opponents
I sit on my throne, it's enormous
Composed with the chorus
My karma is good, dog, and don't need supportin'
My bitch is so gorgeous, I cannot afford
To spend time with her when chasin' these whores
Money, keep countin'
She strip like Lance Mountains
My passport is packed
How I travel, astoundin' (Yeah)
""Thug Waffle""—did that
Now we comin' back for the killer contract
Pull up on your pampers
Three man army
Address the bitch niggas in a song, call it Palm Trees
Not a fan of you if you ain't ever hug my moms, b
Not a fan of niggas that be talkin' where I'm gon' be
Talk a lot of mess, leave you niggas out of pocket
Don't talkin' to me less you talkin' bout a profit

Smoked about a hundred blunts and I ain't even high yet
Wrote my verse in poison ink, watch you biters digest
Got the illest grind yet, no eye can deny this
Lungs full of uh, eyes bloody red, nigga
Gold fangs on, uh, pocket full of dead niggas
Smoke some, bitch, what the fuck you waiting on?
I know it's a virtue, but baby, my patience is gone
Get our relation on, take her to a vacant home
What you want, a quicky sticky? Okay, I won't takey long
Split the dutch down the middle like Moses did the sea
Count it up, bag it up, we love money, we love weed
Met this one bimbo, told her my name was Meech
But she keep calling me Mandingo
My eyes bloody red so she probably think I'm evil
Truly, it's the weed smoke from all this sour diesel
Light it, then I breathe slow

Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me, yo
Fuck the police though, we smoke it like it's legal
Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel
Blunts Siamese, two of these, you be me, yo

Smoke break

Juicy, Mr. Young Bone, AK, I'm so gone
Hoes love me - Jeroooome, hoes love me - Jerooooome
Sit back, get smacked, get stoned
In the back of the back of the room
With a Mac in the back of the room, she acting doomed
Blaow, splat in the room
Women, they awful, I mean they on fours
Call this my dumb flow, Urkel, Waldo
Call this my purp flow, roll up the indo
I'm here, dog, what you here for?
Hip-hop is dead, Zombies for prez
Remindy, untimely, two blunts I'm Siamese
Pussy, we grind thee, sticky and grimey Wicked unchain me, twisted my frame be
Blunt after blunt after blunt
So stuck, so stuck off the what?
Sticky, icky, quickly, vicky, lick me, no hickeys, gin and whiskey
Just me and some kitties, swiftly

Seaweed flow, must be from that weed smoke
Eyes Chinese cause we smoking sour diesel

This Is It,3001: A Laced Odyssey,2016.0,"All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame
Form your business in the name, something unique like a slang
Make a difference, make a change
But ain’t no puppets on a string
Don’t be chilling on the couch, remember this is for the clout
Remember this is for the poor niggas that’ll represent you when you’re out
Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

Always was a winner even when I wasn’t 'posed to
The money getting bigger as if it wasn’t supposed to
Just a lonely nigga, talk too much to myself, need a break
On July 8th broke down heaven’s gates
Now I stay high all day
Fuck you leaving, fuck all evening
Call me mister fuck all day
Trap all day and night
Don’t need a house much less you ‘bout some change
Expand my conscious, tryna’ walk on water
Feel the earth on me
You hatin’, I’ll be somewhere slayin’ bitches by their face on me
Catch a fade, Kobe, with an eighth on me
Not phased, don’t pass that shit homie
Cough, smoke, cough, got my shit sealed off
‘Bout to put some in the air, ‘til a nigga doze off
Cos you got some shrooms, I got a room
You and me ‘til we reach the moon
Never wore a disguise, love the skin I’m in
You trade your soul for fame, we ain’t built the same

All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame

Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

All I ever wanted was to be a one to one
Now I’m one in three
Compulsively a nigga gotta run up or get none
Know I feel your pain, a different day
Opinions always alter when you’re done
Pray to put you down, afraid to look around, instead I pen it for my dogs (Hoo!)
Know my city give me 150 for my steez, 150 for my beats
Three niggas, we gotta eat
Shouts to fans that’s overseas, hey
Independent grind, at least we did form a company
We a bond that never breaks, never giving up the cake
Not a fan of pointing fingers at men
It’s dependent on who can pay for academics
Homie your chemists are missing appendages
You back into handling business, no kidding
My head’s at the clinic, I need a prescription
My vision is clearer through smoke and them mirrors
I can’t be compared to those niggas you hearing
So don’t be offended when niggas don’t feel you

All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame
Form your business in the name, something unique like a slang

All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

Feeling brave? Nigga run up
Buck shots, tear your muscle
And I don’t need Joey to pump it
Pitbull, no muzzle
Badmon, I’m thuggin’
Done know, gun smoke
Can’t tell me nothin’, there’s no need for discussion
I’m the sinner in Saint, I'm the box logo bully
Used to buy Bathing Ape, now they send this shit to me
I paved the way for niggas that're scared to say what they ain't wanna say
Now watch a demon demonstrate, annihilate
Love / hate it's all the same
Will I die from my homicide
Or will I die from taking too much drugs?
Lord knows I deserve to die on an acid high and I’m double cupped
Coke line, hundred blunts
Seen a few bitches I’d love to fuck
2Pac in 96 and troublesome
27 club, here I come
Comma, c-c-c-c comma, comma, comma
A whole lot of decimals
I just s-see my account and c-c-c-c-c-c-c count all my blessings up
Bloodstream full of chemical
Crip, Blood, twist your fingers up
Better than some of them veterans
Bet they gon’ say it’s beginners luck
I would die for my niggas, but would they do the same?
Hennessey by the gallon, I'm losing my balance and manage the pain
I would ride for my niggas, just show me the lane
My grandaddy's still in the kitchen, w-w-whipping the ‘caine
My celly’ keep ringing
I cannot find enough coverage to answer
The backwoods is hitting
Hope that that shit is not giving me cancer
Trip on acid while I'm rapping, Sippin' muddy, counting money
I think she took too many xannies, she fell asleep while she was sucking

Made it out the gutter, shout out to my mother
Kudos to my papa, he ain’t wear the rubber
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers...

Cause the truths in the pyramids
Cause we all fucking immigrants

Not a good time unless I smoke mine
Too many drugs that make you go blind
Too many thugs that work for more crime

Wildin', this is for my niggas that smoke weed
Live life by the day, count the proceed
Blow it back, blowin' cash in the OZ
Miss the phone, got it on, looking closely
Only independent, we don't need a co-sign
Jah shit, the bud make arms in no time
It's the fourth quarter at the baseline
Kissing your daughter, Mary Jane high
Just the same guys Juice, Darko, and I remarkable times
Ultra dead minds
Zombie-Bape line, no harm it takes time
Enjoy the palm trees
We on vacation

Rang, rang
Who that calling? The money or the fame
Shit ain't the same since we crept in the game
So I get high and try to maintain
My celly rang, rang
Who that calling? The money or the fame
Shit ain't the same since we stepped in the game
So I get high and try to maintain

Gloves on, murder one, homi'
They'll be looking for the prince, like King Jaffe
Smoking Moroccan hashish
With my slanted eye, zombie mommy
Hennessy fill my body
These other rappers copy, oops
I forgot to mention, wrote this in another dimension
Zombie gang, be what I'm repping
Pussy so good I need seconds to step in
Two Mac 11s with twenty K on the necklace and a Heckler Koch
Bought this for the hecklers that be neck in cock
On a mission, clearest vision
Views from the scope from my Glock
Only high percentage shots
Shoot with one eye like Fetty Wap
With my block, Flatbush Ave, rotten flesh and money knots
Never trust these hoes, I never did, never will
I pop a tab and crack a seal, zombie gang, drugs kill
Never lied, if I did then let me fry - Futurama
And these Jordans on my feet don't come out 'til next summer
Pretty grungy like Nirvana
Dirt Cobain is what she holla
When I dropped this dick inside her
Only fuck her if she legal, I don't break the laws like Tyga
Unless it's moving LSD, lean and shrooms and marijuana
If I ever pay for pussy it was with counterfeit dollars
Ugly niggas still getting bitches
I'm like the second Shabba
Hit the trigger 'til my fingers blister
If I got a problem, paint his top - Dennis Rodman
I'm superficial and conscious
I'm a walking contradiction
I'ma burn in hell probably but I'ma keep Satan waiting
I ain't done fornicating with women in every flavour
Eating pussy with chop sticks
You know I love my Asians
You would think, USC who he play with
Trojan helmet on, put her in the backspace
And then I hit the escape key in the bank
With the Jason mask, asking where the safe is
Catch me motorcycle, black and gold Letterman
Saint Laurent, leopard print
I stampede any beat
Nigga I ain't got no preference
I'm setting precedents while chasing Presidents
My mic presence is heaven sent
It's like I got an extra sense, no censorship
I'm in my essence, limitless, no blemishes
My penmanship, a Erving J is jus' always leads to swish
I roll and pick, then blow a zip
You can blow my dick and eat my excrement

I smoke to death, might lose my ears
Walking dead, can't feel my tears
Fake love in disguise
I repute those that get near
I let my soul fly like fruits from our peers
I got some questions, I got some weed, I got some acid
Needlepoint LSD
I got a bad bitch we could settle fees
And if your eyes open there is still more to see
They try to tell me I was wrong
I'm still looking
Last night I spent a couple hours up in Central Bookings
Only had a dub but I was trapping prostitution
Weed, coca leaves, percs and LSD
Two hundred for the bottle
Add it up, more for me
Thinking back, I'm still here it's lovely
Ripping shows and blowing cheese
Oh, you love me? Soon we'll see
Palm trees and double Ds
They want that old shit?
Well, fuck y'mean?

Rang, rang
Who that calling? The money or the fame
Shit ain't the same since we crept in the game
So I get high and try to maintain
My celly rang, rang

Shine on these niggas
Glide on these niggas
Show these niggas what the business is, nigga
Zombie Gang, nigga
Huh? Zombie Gang, nigga
Half-dead, nigga
We living life, nigga
Nigga stole the dead the way we living, like, so crazy man

Gold on my neck—Mr. T
Victory, victory
Zombie Gang reppin' that NYC
Victory, victory
Ice round my neck like I'm Lil Weezy
We run this shit like a pair of cleats
It's Hell on Earth but this where I be

""Money over bitches"" on my headstone
Here lies ""Young nigga gettin' paid""
Put ""Never take a loss"" on my headstone
Only take a L when I'm smokin' haze
Zombie Gang three times on my headstone
Been thuggin' from the Cradle to the Grave
Now your favorite rapper name on a headstone
Too late—he already dead

Imagine when you're thirty thousand feet up what you think of?
Boy, I hated knowin' that my thoughts deterred a dream
Cause I never knew I'd get my chance to link up
Boy, I tell you, all of this unusual to me
Swear I came from the bottom, Flatbush livin', walkin' dead on
Put your favorite rapper's name up on a headstone
Biggie Big for the cheese and you're dead wrong
Propaganda set the standards in the terrordome

I hit it Doggystyle, she throw it back, yeah, I'm Born to Mack
It's Dark and Hell is Hot so leave me where I'm at
I'm livin' how I wanna, no Reasonable Doubt
It's clear to see, All Eyez on Me, 400 Degreez
Who am I? Ruthless, Eazy does it
The Chronic smoke in public, Hate It Or Love It
The underdogs, with Liquid Swords
It Was Written in my diary, this Art of War
I'm feelin' Infamous, Immortal with my Technique
A Revolutionary shinin' with diamond teeth
Young Don Cartagena, excuse my demeanor, this the Glamour Life
You Still Not a Player, you ain't half as nice
I'm Born Again, Life After Death, I made the sacrifice
I'm Supa Dupa Fly, Juicy keep them Hypnotized
I said my name is Juice, AmeriKKKa's Most
Ain't No Half-Steppin', see you at Tha Crossroads

Put ""Money over bitches"" on my headstone
Here lies ""Young nigga gettin' paid""
Put ""Never take a loss"" on my headstone
Only take an L when I'm smokin' haze
Zombie Gang three times on my headstone
Been thuggin' from the Cradle to the Grave
Now your favorite rapper name on a headstone
Too late—he already dead

It Was Written in the Children's Story, that Life's a Bitch
So What'cha Want? Everyday I Struggle with it
Only God Can Judge Me slippin', I'm infinitely Big Pimpin'
Though The Genesis, Dead Presidents, Drop a Gem on 'Em
Hell on Earth, these the Last Dayz, Throw Ya Guns Up
Get Money, Quiet Storm, havin' Suicidal Thoughts
For the C.R.E.A.M, Renegade
For the money, all the green is the lemonade
I'm A Playa on the Late Night Tip, shorty Triple Six
She the prototype Tip Drill, kiss her fingertips
Resevoir Dogs, check The Score, Ignorant Shit
Blackout, Can I Live? Hellrazor, still feel me

Kiss of Death and Protect Ya Neck, Shame on a Nigga

Deep breaths, struggling to reach home base
Awkward nigga, motherfucker, this is a race
God made me great, so I been invisible to hate
Partly humane, part of the same, part of the game
Used to smoke a Parliament before I partied with my pain
And Bacardi was the same, 151 to your brain
But I'd rather beg my pardon than to party with you lames

Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity

Sit back and analyze my life like Montana did white
All the bitches I hit, and all the bitches I might
Clearly underrated amongst all the favorite
But fuck it, my style's like Magic Speed Seduction
I'ma keep smoking 'til my lungs collapse
And fuck y'all laws, I'ma keep my straps
Setting the plans, controlling mine and reaching the land
I'm better off dead, somebody fill my head up with lead
Dropped out of high school, lint in my pocket
I picked up the profit, the block bitching, bitches is hawking
Grandma don't want me, Grandpa kinda lonely
Pay my dues, wear my jewels, refuse, never I lose
But fuck that, on my last dollar and my bus pass
Fucking with some niggas that'll give a mother fuck
Who fucking with us? No one fucking with us, time to reconsider

Fuck the moon, fuck the stars, fuck Venus and Mars
Fuck a Rolex and diamond ring with them flashy cars
Fuck the last supper, fuck your church and its gospel
Fuck them halfway dead niggas in the hospital
Fuck my left lung, fuck my right lung
Fuck my chrome gun, fuck my black gun

Your Favorite Rap Song,3001: A Laced Odyssey,2016.0,"Oh, I swear
All I ever wanted was to be somebody
My reefer cloudy, lost to each assignment
Making beats and rhyming so proceed to find me
My speech align with ""teacher, teacher help me seek the knowledge""
But the street's is evil, we proceed to flee police and sirens
Grievance foul, reaper loud six feet my ego grow
Shawty grip it both hands letting off my eagle low
Bust it back and forth there's no remorse
I win of course I'm in
You fraudulent, I'm selling drugs
Where's the love? hit my plug
This is for my 40 busta's holding crutches
Cause they know they hustlers
While the man is tryna cobra clutch us
I drank a whole 8 bottles man I won't discuss this
Cause even if it's champagne better know your substance
Fancy nigga's stuck on a brand name
But any day it's O.E over champagne
I'm talking shit for my fan's sake
I give a fuck who can't relate 
I'm Erick landscape
I paint the picture for peace
Large wishes dismembered in several scenes
I'm Kubrick with chemistry
You're degenerate, generously
Poor me, poor, poor me
Got them hooked one time so I gotta OD

All I ever wanted son was a brick
A mask and a hunnid guns put a grip
In a mesh if you want it son for them chips
I be damned and I run at you, yeahhhhh

I'm painting portraits while endorphins spinning
I'm high as hell when indulging in these gorgeous women
Pave the future for boosters as I'm contributing my two cents
So I'm a nuisance
Producing and I tighten the loop, like it's a noose-sence
Who's this? not for amusement, I'm never clueless
I do this but never foolish, you doo doo and that's what stool is
My crew is cool as the Fonz and you're Ferris Bueller
No honouring my medulla
No time for your common coonery
Prognosis was doses of mean rock
Dreaming I been thugging like when Afeni conceived Pac
Papa told me fame would only flood my brain
So when you washed up is when you focus on these lames
Money murdering music my main objective is this
I'm pushing the envelope and I seal yo' death with a kiss
Mind, soul and spirit
Concious because I'm near it
The whisper is the mirror to all my merit's
So fuck you if you ain't hear it nigga

All I ever wanted son was a brick
A mask and hunnid guns put a grip
In a mesh if you want it son
For them chips I be damned and I run at you
Yeahhhhh
All I ever wanted son was a brick
A mask and hunnid guns put a grip
In a mesh if you want it son
For them chips I be damned and I run at you
Yeahhhhh

All I wanna do is
Sit back, smoke sacks, bump my new shit
Ahhhh
All I wanna do is
Sit back, smoke sacks, bump my new shit
Uh
You can reach into your pocket
While I reach into my mind
Clarity is so divine
We just see through the design
The physical we inherit
By visions on TV screens
Chasing the fucking dream
Livin' to fit the scene
Never I'm fucking clean
Never this obscene
The green like six teens
Flip O's a machine
Vaccine I'm poison
Got guns like marines
Smoke good the routine
Love it, that pussy
Juicy the top dog, juicy like hot sauce
Juicy like AI
, 
break necks like Benoit
I flow it the Hulk Hogans
Blow it the best doja
Hold ya composure
Pet bring the coffin
Death will console ya
Remember me blessing you fools with my energy
My energy
Blessing you fools with my energy
Remember me blessing you fools with my energy
My energy
Moving through life like there ain't no tomorrow
Blazing all these mics like show-time at Apollo
Thinking bout my life full circle and the sorrow
Gotta get the C.R.E.A.M
Money motivations, greens galore
Yeh, I like that shit raw, tell me how that shit feel
Living legend, 20 something, imagine how my dick feel
God damn it how does all my shit feel
Men win and men lose, sometimes a friend too
Steaming on the tops, I'm never stealth from the fuck
I've never felt like I'm not
Swagger it's in my roots
New York we the greatest, these rap niggas hate us
Most you niggas wanna be us, I can see it in they faces
Been like the same since, seventeen beating cases
Same drugs and same names
, different places
Same kick game perspective just switch lanes
Been hot for 4 years
, my nigga Isaac Blaze
A true meaning it seems, underground kings
Still high without my wings, survive and still I dream
Equality and loyal over fallacies and more
And where I come from the hood is still niggas poor
Pour another bottle fuck America's dreams
Do it for your family or life ain't what it seems
Get it how you live and album sales wouldn't matter
Still running through you niggas like a mother fucking bladder--

I was conceived under the rubble of the buildings
That Snoop crumble back in 19-s-s-s-something
Someone once told me suffering would lead to the discovery of something deep
Inner Peace—Mind, Body, Soul; Holy Trinity
The Dark Man rides the pale horse
Down the road the checker board
Kaleidoscope vision, my vision in vivid is formed
My prism is shimmering glistening I'm giving off
A ray of light, ironic cause my name comes from the dark
I am the spawn of the sin of my pops, yeh I was taught
But I've evolved and got involved my only flaw is that I know
My only flaw and the earth revolves whether I am on it or naw
But fuck that let's break the law
We're scared of loss because my fam cannot afford to flee
Should a nigga sport Balmain denim in Saint Laurent
Gold coliseum front painful, haters' loss
8 whores pack the front of the bus, we on tour
World War 3 when I undraw these vocals C4
Laying my punchlines like landmines
I was born on the darkest day, in blood I was baptised
I can't help but harness hate watch this capricorn decapitate
Gimme a 10, gimme a 9, fuck just gimme a gatling
So I can crash the reunion and splatter his whole family
Who gon' be at communion?
Sports, drugs and entertainment keep our computers viewing The wordsmith
You turd shit
I can be a nuisance to any rapper that's spewing that shit that we been doing
Rolling stone with this chrome I leave his body in ruins
I ch-chew him and pew pew him, I'm Duke Nukem
Fuck y'all niggas doin
How dare these rappers over bite the man with the overbite
Above par, above the bar, I'm over nice
God ain't even shoulder-height
Pocket knife, clean slice, grab that M.O.P
I'm as cold as ice,
 a walking talking poltergeist
It's Fleezus Christ, I turn water to acid
I can straighten out the meanest dyke
7 gram backwood, now my eyes Korean tight
My Grandpa can't read or write
The cops never read my rights
Running from them flashing lights like Ye when he was still with Nike
Devil's pie, the final slice, gave my life up to the mic
Every rhyme I spit precise
I channel ODB and Big and Pac before I sit and write
Her C-cups is sitting right
I'm just tryin to lick and bite and fuck and fight
Who you kidding, there's no fiction, nigga this the facts of life
Acid tab and dirty sprite, I'm living the absurdist life
YSL Denim and Phillip Lim my jeans virgin tight
Your favorite rapper bit my whole life, but he ain't serve it right
Come on dog, I got more bars than when your service right
110 in the stolen coupe then I'm swerving right
Fly with me come see these heights
Don't be scared, hol' on tight
Y'all should call me Conrad Murray the way I murder Mike

So she bless us with
Pussy, drugs, and money
I ride for my dogs, get high with my dogs
Niggas won't snitch, don't abide by the law
Blowing loud on the porch, Makaveli on my thoughts
How many real niggas will be down for the cause?

Some days are made for reminiscing
Drug dealers with no product or pot to even piss in
Permission by granted God we see Allah
Molecules, minuscule, and regardless of who you are
You a part of early stardom, I believe we all achieve
In the eyes of martyrs, never a problem
Hearts fall apart so I stitched mine
Quick to choke a nigga, I be tryna bitch mine
Shorty sweet like clementine
I rap for the niggas that make beats but never get to shine, shine
Hey, Vinyl Blue in Green, Miles Davis CDs
I compose my sixteens before eighty-eight keys
The first time I did drugs it was making the beats
MPC bang my head, it even haunts me in sleep
Everybody's a snake, that's why I try to keep the grass cut
See it when they coming, then I heat they ass up

If rap was illegal, you bitch niggas wouldn't even write a bar
Shit, I'd probably be behind bars
Raising the bar through these bars, I am at the bar
Taking shots of Henny, telling the bartender about all of my flaws
I'm in love with hip-hop not from the allure
I am sure, every single dog gets its day on the cross
No labels telling me fables, bitch, I am my own boss
Stoned off Triple OG, watch me zone off
Supreme entity, 
public enemy
, energy that I'm harvesting
In pursuit of the riches, I want more green than them army men figures
So much 'shrooms and acid that my thoughts
Are tangled and twisted like gangbanger fingers
Right before they flick on the trigger and dismantle your ligaments
Metal fragments will hit you, so many holes in a nigga
That when the wind blows, he whistles, bet that I could read your mental
With my finger on temple and learn the deepest
Darkest secrets that your shadow will tell you
Cause you heard that I'm a better beast and stay closer to jay like a memory
And if your eyes ain't bloodshot, you need to get some better weed
Screaming, what the bloodclot?
 
Shotty in a stolen V
Follow the law? I don't even follow the lord, 
flexing
Like I just shot up a bottle of 'roids,
 sexing
Bad exotic chick on top of your boy, chip on my shoulder
Only if chips involved, motherfucker

""I see you got yourself a little business going. Well, that's good, that's good, when you make that paper, but when you making paper you gotta learn some rules to go with it. You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter. There's two types of niggas in this world: there're niggas with guns and niggas with butter. Now what are guns? The guns, that's the real estate. There's stocks and bonds, artwork, you know shit that appreciates with value. What's the butter?

It's fucking Friday, I need a Nia Long
With a nice set of tits and a green thong

Cheech Chong
A French bitch, pussy sweet, honey Dijon
She love the paper, everywhere the cash be
Now baby girl, pop that pussy like some acne
I must be balling cause she only fuck with athletes
I'm that deep, smoking purple in a black tee
I love weed nigga, I got a green thumb
She fuck me nigga, until she bleed cum
Your favorite crew will be on milk cartons soon

Where there is no hate, and you don't need flesh
A bright idea, you can see me in the nighttime
Got weed, a bitch, a pack of rubbers, and some white wine
Got left behind cause you wasn't in your right mind
Lost all your paper cause you wasn't in the right grind
I put my dick between her tits, now we Siamese
Fucked her on the floor so I won't mess up my designer sheets
Made her pussy fart, burp, cough, her vagina speak
She suck away the pain and strain her brain like it's finals week

Perfect day, ten bitches, some sour diesel
11 coffins, my flow ugly awesome, you hear this shit
And get lost and eventually I have a fortune
That'll be awesome
Getting hand-painted portraits of me getting my balls licked
Pump-action shotty that will shoot off your door hinge
Dusting weed by the ton, nigga needed forklifts
Razor blade under my tongue while I spit this raw shit

The macking spectacular, is you fucking or nothing?
Mmm, a little sumchin
Bitch, you know I'm buzzing, bumpity bumping
Packs in the back of Mack's trunk and drunk and
We up yet we slumping, Zombie fully function
Fu-fu-fuck corruption, lies vivid as Jenna's titties
Terrorist experiments, America's full of shit, uh
Blinded by skin color, blinded by his lover
Blinded by shining lights, and you the gift of life
Relax my mind 'til it's do or die
Each moment's a mineral, poetry's protein
The verse is a vitamin, effects like codeine

What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)

Meechy Darko
DTA, I don't trust none of my homies
Juice laced my spliff with PCP and never told me
Passed me a cup of bleach and said Meech sip on this codeine
Wash it down with OE, now I'm throwed up like O.G.'s
My voice hold the beat down, it's the anchor
And my nigga stay with the metal like Kurt Angle
Zombies blowing up like the Boston marathon, boom
What, too soon? Opposite of late bloom
Dunk from the free throw since I was spewed from the womb
Survival of the fittest, I ate my twin in the womb
And due to Robin Givens, I may never jump the broom
And while you pay for pussy I was out in paid dues
Stage diving turned a couple thousand people to my pool
You a fool if you think I ain't on the move
I am it, I am new, I exude
But cannot be reproduced, execute for my grimy and my destitute

What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)

The Architect
Spit in your face at the pearly gates
At twenty-four a nigga special like he thirty-eight
The limerick I kick is four finger ring shit
I twist a motherfucker limbs up like a green spliff
Defying odds
No façade, man my city like Oz
So with this tree of weed I'm never tryna be the prize
Rap, produce, half a Muse when I scribe thought
A quiet man, so if I can't stand then I'ma fall
I'd rather be a failure than never mentioned at all
The dimensions of the mind measure crime like yellow tape
Music the bass, swap my heart for an 808
You outta shape, smoking great good god, like J.R
Nostrils filled with the potency of smoking kief
All the windows down so you know it's me
Bow down, my radiator hiss like my Amy Wine vinyl, for now

What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)
What you gon' do when them zombies come for you
(Murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill)",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-death-lyrics
Trade Off,3001: A Laced Odyssey,2016.0,"It's that work hard, play hard
Make you quit that day job
I smoked so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
I plan to take a trip
Want the money how it's spent
I just re-up
Plus I just payed my phone and the rent

Hey, it's lit
Call my partners up, we going up, you slowing up
I never judge, we do indulge
In truth I never touch this stuff
One puff of that fluffy stuff, shit hit me like a sucker punch
Side effects include mass paranoia plus the cotton mouth
Down another bottle with my niggas
Before this was a movie we pictured us living bitter
And I forgive 'em, whatever, whatever
Telling me different
Nothing is given without sacrifices
Something is close to niggas to chill with
Pray for the children
The government spiking penicillin
And lord willin'
We all live to be 20 million
Outcome infinite dawg, where is the ceiling?
Cause five years ago we came to be without disappearing

Want the money how it's spent

I just got a blow job
Smoke so much this year we couldn't even take a day off
Twenty something years, I never had a fucking day job
Never ask for truth, it's what expected, it's a trade-off

Real nigga shit, getting money bound to flip
Now turned on like I'm the shit
Bitch I told you how it gets
It’s that mixtape rap blunt wrapped up in a album
In a audi black tote straps lookin' for yack
So I can go top speed with the blinkers on
Screaming ""Fuck the world"", Martin King is gone
Who am I? Who am I?
Handsome guy, might stunt on you niggas with a patch on my eye
Please, turn up the headphones I speak the value
I pray for freaks, we gon bring the outcome
Toke, toke and choke
We just need your vocals
So this is the future, ain't what your used to
Four years ago I was poorer than you are
Trapping in the lobby and the back of a U-haul

It's that work hard, play hard

This that work hard, play hard
Rest in peace to Trayvon
Did so much different drugs this year I'm feeling so amazing
LSD them potent doses smoking 'til I take off
Two freaks, one Meech, that's an even trade-off

Rosemary's baby the hand I rock my cradle to the grave
I had six exorcisms this year alone and I feel the same
I'm high and  sleep deprived, having nightmares while I'm still awake
40 ounce, sipper, until my liver give away
I think I lost my mind and, I'm willing to trade my soul if you can find it
An even exchange I'm young and deranged
All these drugs in my body
Rawer than the kilo under my granddaddy pillow
Kill a cop, la-la-laugh, reload
Ha-ha-ha, drop classics, we know
Laugh at you niggas
I average 50, I don't feel the need to pass to you niggas
Roll up the sticky, young irrational nigga
Don't throw stones, unless your crib is shatter proof nigga
A headshot, now let's see if you splatter-proof nigga

That fear a black man with tattoos and bandanas
But when a white man wear tattoos and bandanas
And joins a bike gang it's all cool where the balance?
Hate my black flesh, bet you're mad that I came up
You cannot change, rearrange my chemical make-up
Pigmentation, 
annunaki blood
Who just wanted to make ya

I make a whore drop drugs with my cranium
Telepathy,

You can't find a better beast
Better off dead, I sever off heads

So they got their hands out, they gone get their palms read
Red from all they bloodshed

Point your finger, play the blame game
Fuck it dog it's the American way
Get high, my nigga, maintain
Tell lies, chase fame

Trust me dog it's the American way

Music my own drug, distributed through the people
Niggas will never change unless you thinkin' you need to
We were built to destroy, home of the unemployed
We callin' it rap, while you callin' it noise
So evacuate your homes, radios never play my favorite song
Miss America would never be black, no use in tellin' me that
Everybody could coincide, it could never be that
Good riddance to the realest, but you gotta feel us
Gettin' cash every day, twistin' flame,
 hurtin' feelings
Stereotype, never marry a wife
Another block-nigga making music, maybe you right
Most definitely and you questioning me
If the world fucked up the exception is me
The government love guns till they aimed at you
Ain't no tellin what I might do for the red white and the blue

Oh shit, Oh Lord
Here we go again finna get these packs off
Repetitive sedative, got a fetish for fetishes
An American menace, I'm manifesting my businesses
Realest as realest gets, terror the terrorists
If you put your hands out I'mma crush your fingertips
Fuck Bloomberg, that man absurd
Throw him in the trunk right up on the curb
Hop out mash out leave his ass thurr
Niggas talk shit but I don't fear words
Better off dead, prepare for the worse
Been slaved since the my first damn days on this earth
Fuck social security and fuck homeland security
9/11 biggest fraud in history
And all you rappers ain't god damn shit to me
Getting fucked by a label
Fame-chasing, bitch-chasing, lonely-ass nigga, probably
Go and snitch you ain't going to face it
In debt to the red white and blue
Your government lies so who the fuck is you

Most of these rap niggas hating us
Feel like I got six people living inside my cranium
Help me, I see dead people, I'm talking them Benjamins
Six senses just ain't enough
I need a bad bitch, about a billion bucks
Telling me I been a monster, man, that boss, man
My sonograms full of solid granite, them gold fangs, that real shit
No hologram when you talk slick, you get hit with extra gram
Bu-buck shot and then they gon' bounce
Some ducked down, some niggas ran
Came in this game talking shit, acid tab, hashish bricks
Codeine-sip, weed in my lungs, easy flip, I got the right plug
All these drugs, I got to like one
All this beef, I got the right punch
What situation is the right one?
What you gon' do, die or run?

7 A.M., woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
Waiting for this pack, got to fit the whole team
Five-O on my back, gotta make it best, man
Little stress here, bit of stress here
Got a 9 milli weapon for protection to kill niggas off, no question
Nah, niggas is announcing the brown skin
Man, this no bullshit, they scared of us
And they took a right to not give a fuck
Someone loaded up 'til my trigger bust
And they been down for us, just how a nigga bust
Shout-out to my niggas on the corner with the raw
Trying to make a little living 'bout what a nigga can't afford
Who put them drugs in the hood, anyway?
Who told these niggas we ain't shit everyday?
They start the trend and we followed in
'Fore the copper chopper trying to hollow me
These bars ain't ready, gotta call 'em in
My pack funky, that parliament
Put Pall Mall grandfather cigs, Paul Wall, my grill is
Tipping my verses, my bitches get serviced
We vicious, we serpents, we ripping this Earth shit

Uh, this is how I operate, no MD, just emcee
Been contemplating this architecture
Been all semester, they ignored the message
Leave shorty wet, my stain on Balmain
All of my niggas are shooters, they aim
Full of description, your fists where they missing
And mission: this is an original, man
My ism is torture, we live in the system
Where niggas in prison for pushing a dime
Shooting to kill, gunning 'em down
Who can distinguish what is on ground?
Smoking this dope and my arm in Rick Ow'
Carry that shit like I'm holding an ""O""
A nigga talking reckless, same, we smoking Dutches
On a certain substance, balling on a budget
Give you a minimum when you exhibit a criminal mimic
And miracles, they get demerited

Fuck a feature, my ether is equal to each of your own
Embodied the balance of the world on my shoulders alone
But God bless America, my Gs go hard
Gs make dreams and these grams make gods
I am so compelled, might as well proceed another step
Never took a L, still fresh without the double X
Manson, ransom, artificial anthems
Ladies say he handsome, these niggas throwing tantrums
Tripping to existence is often labeled as miscreants
Cause we position it different, real hard to make sense of it
Record labels making cents, we sensitive
Now we acting senseless, fuck you, Architect for president

I'm on my freeze time, leaping in and out of portal shit
You on your prick your finger from a thorn, mere mortal shit
I'm on my Heath Ledger, I can't get my mind in order shit
Hitler at a bar mitzvah, torturous, slaughter shit
I am really that nigga, call it quits, get off my dick
Give a camera the finger every time I hear a flick
The code has been cracked and I am the glitch, do you hear this shit
Like a rabbit turd, I swing on a track absurd
My rhyme schemes and my bars infinite
I hear your shit and get a little narcoleptic
I admit you're kind of boring, I was out touring
Stroking kittens with dimples that remind me of Lauren

Every day, live it like it's it for me
Black on black in time with my roots this is my ghetto symphony
Shout out to my fam and my homies, we making history
Never had a degree, but the streets made me a sicker breed
Every day another drug, experimental in my mental
Had to tone it down, I c-couldn't see without my liquid liquid
Had to learn how to balance life man, I can't fucking stand it
Court fees, bought pleas, nigga where's your fucking manners
How you hatin' on us, but claim the king of NY?
These niggas ain't fit to be the king, go ask Jadakiss why
I'm in the lobby right now, 16:55
I got a bitch like Cardi B, bet that ass sittin' nice
Don't gotta go to South Bronx to get your Furious Five
40 ounce of malt liquor, joint stuffed with the pie
Boss nigga, best nigga, let y'all do deciding
Hot spitter, dead niggas, man we been through the wire
Somebody call 'em up and let 'em know I been doin' it
You're not that inventive with that coloured hair you're losing it
Imma everyday struggle 'til I get to the top
I study Em, Big, Tech N9ne, 2Pac
Come to my crib unannounced I got a big t-tech to pop
I dumped 9 missing bodies in the f-fucking car lot
And when I'm mad, I get green like the Hulk
Til my brain goes pop and then them thangs go po-po-po-pow

Introducing the Jamie Hewlett of rapper music
Influenced by Stanley Kubrick, exclusive for all my hooligans
Oh, we just recruit again, I can take your prestige
Peculiar with my beats like Juice would be with his weed
Apostle like Meechy Darko, watch Ellington DJ (these)
If triple A could record again, Zion may be at ease
I promised y'all Josh would hold it down, discipline when I (beef)
Disgruntled with all this Fronto, tell Trav to chill with the leaf
My parents should know I love 'em, my momma locked in the grief
I finished this album up, but she barely able to speak
I uncle to everyone I put that on my future (niece)
The sooner you see the picture, you defecate on belief
Living peaceful with keys, messiah with ganja trees
My confidence out the roof, and that done help me believe
Inglorious with them keys, no snortin I can't agree
Living life like a king and there's somethin' I'd rather be

Silence as the semi's shooting sideways at your siblings
Excuse me for the sibilance beginners study and listen
My only mission is to burn in hell and not in prison
That's why I'm spitting shit that make Jesus question religion
This fan told me her parents said I sound like the devil
To me I sound like a poor black kid from the ghetto
Hello, my health declining I'm losing my mind my life's The Shining
Don't know why I love violence, the sight of blood is so exciting
Grip the pistol, coke off a nipple
My brain fried, my memory sizzled, my hood is vicious, don't get it twisted
They hog tied my grandmama and whipped my grandpa with pistols
That's a fact, OG reefer hash wax
Motherfuck your platinum plaque, snakes eat rats
My cellie keep ringing ringing, think they got my phone tapped
Acid trips like activists on Actavis, never pacifist
Pass the spliff, immaculate this is the return of Count Racula
Nothing scare me, I think my real mother is Bloody Mary
I met Virgin Mary and popped her cherry
My vision exquisite I see you clearly
I'm a mix, Manson greatest hits with a hint of 2Pacalypse
And I feed my dog gun powder, carve crucifix on hollow tips
I do not exist, all this weed why I need a therapist
Bitch, I'm a mix, Manson greatest hits with a hint of 2Pacalypse

You copy the same schematics, you making the same songs
You thought that you were the only, but understand it's the physical
Artistry manifest, but no ideas original
Our sickest creation, no need for further analysis
Plus the beats bang prestige giving me calluses
Even if it's assumed, proving it all again
Selling out all the shows never selling out who I am
Mild temper venter, chronic keep me casual
Formally introduced to a journey into the natural
The three, two zeros then proceeded by one
Laced like your woven tennis shoes before you go run
Danger danger, Will Robinson
There's a crisis here, 
nappy ain't dirty
Racist man it's just a type of hair
Nightmares have just begun, there's no enticing him
Limbs relaxed, but your music pop like a Vicodin

Cause new computers ship without the means to play the shit

Eyes closed like I missed this
No forgiveness, just a sick bitch
Cause I'm under destruction what is this?
Just a young nigga ready to get this
If I fall on my face, you're my witness
Feast on my blood when I leave this
Dimension I'm starting to think that
This world is lost like a sea ship
Walking to hell with the demons
How can the heavens defeat them?
Sometimes I just wanna, leave 'em
This feeling is something, I can't run
I just wanna be where I came from
I'm never gon' see where I came from
Rest in peace to the game son
Brooklyn baby reborn
Tripping up, you lukewarm
This is like a warning Flatbush swarming Nike shoes on
Prove them critics wrong getting cream bitch I love it
And the fans hold us down, put nothing above it

The wickedest, man on fire the new Richard Pryor
The wicked lit, rubber on my dick
'Cause I don't want that Charlie Sheen shit
Please don't say you're the highest until you met your highness
I just, want the head like ISIS
Fuck her so precise her pussy gushing like a geyser
I'm Michael Myers with these grip pliers took off your eyelids
I sit in silence, speak in tongues and burned Bibles
So paletted to all of my rivals you will not vanquish my titles
My semi-automatic, will splatter a nigga like Jackson Pollock
Deranged since birth I was conceived in an insane asylum
I solemnly swear this evening to refrain from the violence
Young and wilding, psilocybin still my stylist
LSD drops in my iris, tire mark, police sirens
No guidance, the belly of the beast is where I reside in
Grimy and vibrant like Busta Rhymes, in the early 90's
Click boom, your head blew like you play for the Giants
Lyrical tyrant the way I be rhyming
I deserve all of the Pulitzer prizes my pistol be hiding I pull it surprise 'em
My voice can be hypnotizing every verse I deliver be vivid and visually striking
Been the highest since I arrived and the climate is rising
It's 'bout to get violent cover your eye
And take this lyrical dosage that Doctor Meechy Dark prescribed ya
I slide inside her I love her tight vagina no E-Z Widers
Back to the cypher I got chronic to light up pass me the lighter

Don't frequent Hell, Gorillaz pin on lapel
There's six grams in the blunt, on a mission to find myself
Growin' and breakin' ties, cryin' and savin' lives
Couldn't be discontent, temptation arrives

Yeah, I'm patiently waiting
But I don't really give a fuck if we ain't in your rotation
I put the heart up on this bitch and can't nobody take it
Brooklyn niggas, we take it, Flatbush baby, gon' make it
Check it, but these my brothers, love 'em to death
Written in stone, until I'm gone, we puffin' the death
No concern, nah, compare us, how?
Cool milli off the merch, SoundScan's shuttin' down now

I put the bread down on something I wanted for years
If my brother need some money, man I prol'ly sell that shit, hey
Break it into pieces, ooh, wow; there it is
Brothers make real beats, bomb lyricist
Brothers look the other way, nothing come to trouble mate
This is why I love you dog, I'm smokin' at your mama's crib
My brother not a local, my brother travel continents
No need to find a hotel, my brothers got the couch and shit

Debra's only son, he was conceived in King's County
That was '89, by '92 he was already rowdy
Misunderstood since he crawled out the womb, the only child
And his momma workin' three jobs, one was dealin' with drama
'Cause I was wildin', he used to rarely see his father
They seperated, couldn't keep his dick in his pajamas
Because he was out there hustlin', tryin' to be a provider
Tryin' to turn a pretty penny into a million dollars
They tell you 'bout my family, that bipolar disorder
And due to karma, my first youngin’ gon’ be a daughter
When I was 5, I told my mom I wanted to die
Then we cry, the crazy shit, man, it wasn’t a lie
Man, this life, is filled with stress
So much oppressed, call New York City ""9""
I sit alone and reflect, took me 28 years to realize that I'm blessed
Aunt Pam died from cancer; I quit them cigarettes
Weight of world on my shoulder—I just finished my reps
All addicted to drugs, we all addicted to sex
Feelin' so self-destructive, like I’m clingin' to death
Took my five-digit check and copped some bigger baguettes
Took a look at my ring, finger charm on my neck
Still in touch with myself, that flashy shit won't prevail
I really shopping for happiness, but that shit ain't for sale
But if you don’t show ‘em then they won’t think you do it well
I heard that blood's thicker than them Atlanta strippers
But these my brothers, ain't got real brothers to know the difference
And, Erick, if I could, I'd give your mama my kidney
'Cause she my momma, too, I promise you
I ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Load .4-5 (Rah-rah!) pull homicide for my niggas
Word up, 'cause you my brothers, love 'em to death
Written in stone, I take my heart and rip it out my chest
To prove to you that it's Zombie Gang, rotten flesh
That's to the death, nigga—no more, nothing less
True, indeed, Juice, if you ever off or bleed
I'm takin' care of your seeds, even if that means millions in fees for custody
She wildin' out on court, I’m like, ""Give that bitch what she needs.""
(""Order in the court!"") Judge, please (""Order!"")
I guess I still got alot to maturin' to do
I know we still got a whole lot of world tourin' to do

Like a real bad pussy pad, watch me seep through

Grow your own green trees and cut the middle man

Something that you need, help you to relive sentiment

Shoot one through my heart
Rip my tongue apart

But your heart I don't want, your soul is what I need indeed
Increase the speed, increase the need, dies' the weed
Hit the lighter, breathe and let it take your soul at ease

And even when I'm here wit' Jah, yeah she lay beside of me
Mary, Mary, Mary, oh Mary I like my bitches tattooed and tight
But I like you hairy, my infatuation turned to obsession

All these new weird niggas lyin' when they rappin' (Facts!)
When they really just be talkin' bout some shit that never happened

Lazy bitches screaming ""Where the surgeons at?""
Now black girls off white like Virgil’s brand (More facts!)
Then you got these fake gang bang niggas on the 'Gram
Snitchin' on themself via cam
Excuse me, I think Juice laced my weed again
I don't trust nobody, no, not even myself
That's why I keep a condom on my dick before I leave the crib
You can't buy your bitch’s love, boy there’s always bigger shrimp
If she with you cause you fuck, she gon' find some better dick
Bitches party, party, party like the Spring Breaker flick
See your booty on the 'Gram and never pictures with your kids
Why his uniform so dirty and his Timbs is scuffed to shit?
Meanwhile you on vacation and every weekend is lit
Niggas buy jewelry, buy Jordans, buy Beamer, buy Rover, buy Rolex (Facts!)
Buy Gucci, buy Louis, but you can't buy culture (More facts!)

GOD Blessed the DEAD,BetterOffDEAD,2013.0,"It's that Brooklyn phenom
Psychedelic Tzion, suspended in animation
While lookin down at you peons
Defying the laws of physics, while hitting gravity bongs
After she hit the spliff, her voice get raspier than T-Boz
If you don't like the way i live my life, why dont you take it
In all my past lives i've laughed in my killers faces
I'm into blood, beef, human mutilation
Extended clips squeeze, let it desinigrate em
I'm from a place where hell is considered a safe haven
Since its the root of all evil, we thank satan for this paper
I don't give a fuck about who pregnant or who rich
I dont give about her ice or his whips
Money blemishes, you can't spit the way you used to spit
Sometimes a artist become bigger then the art that he presents
Fuck the spectacle they put these fuck boys on the pedestal
I'm feeling skeptical, 'cause ignorance is bliss
I'm with my ignorantest chick
And ignorantest ain't a word, but I'm so ignorant it is
This the flow that send 'em shiv—ers
From every verse, from every curse
I am cursed with this curse to outdo my last verse
To outshine my last word, never decline
No backwards

I ain't here to tell stories
I ain't here to tell lies
The game ain't been the same since BIG fucked around and died
The game ain't been the same since Pac fucked around and died
The game ain't been the same since Pun fucked around and died

RedEye to Paris,Day of the Dead EP,2015.0,"""'Cause y'all grew up watchin' Rambo and Commando and Cobra and Schwarzenegger, coincidently is now the governor of a state in America. So where does the social responsibility fall for Hollywood? Na'mean, that's why, me, I try tell us that art is a reflection of life. I wants the youth not to shoot and leave a song about it.""

How can I only handle my business from this 9-5
I smoke that dope, I call that potent, smokin' till I'm paralyzed
High as hell I'm blinded, Zombies been auto pilot
This year my bro told me get mine
Oui oui, we in Paris
Skepta MC, architecture the textures of beats
My complexion obsessive to infections when I call to freaks
While this mind is matured I got my green from my fans
So if you smokin' on Reggie, I smack that green from your hands
My revival, ye nah take me title cause me nah stifle
No man, no war, no rifle
Me day are in the ghetto, sense it pon' me head stone
If I was a star, word to God I'd be Fredro
It's all fashion, I smokes good I talks lavish
Led to fame, a French name, expensive habits
Tappin' out to chicken wings from Bob Backlund
Whole Foods, I eats good, it's organic

In Paris, got hotties, no molly—just ganji
Stone like a brick, meet you in the lobby
Gettin' dome off the rip, gold colored tints
Whip like I whip, lay my shit down ya shrimp
Technical message spray and beheaded
Get used to slayin'
They useful, they used to slaves
Zulu man use their great
The gruesomest truths
Hidden in America's roots
Livin'? I'm barely, just shoot
To the stars and cave in the roof
Big timer for the majors it's proof
Skepta with the ganja, salute
Represent for my mama, stay true
Gotta get it for low and the flip too
Flatbush in the news, cops killed who?
Victims of the blue gotta trust who
Money on my mind, what I've been through
All alone in this world with a issue
Sticking to the grime like a tissue
Sacrifice for the world, gonna miss you
One wish, few blunts and a pistol
Frank White in a drop top we miss you
Tip top, hip-hop rap's official
Not hot, been told not official
Big shot, big plot my confession
Zombies worldwide, continental

Yo shawty on my wood wood
Ay it ain't no problem cause we smokin' on that good good
Light one for my niggas who represent the hood hood
You know we smokin' that fire, she light the wood
Dawg I just fuck her good
Yo shawty on my wood wood
Ay it ain't no problem cause we smokin' on that good good
Light one for my niggas who represent the hood hood
You know we smokin' that fire, she light the wood
Dawg I just fuck her good

Won't be known until I'm on and niggas hand me the throne
Physically been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
If a nigga nice as me then he must be a clone
Yo bitch is foamin at the mouth, I had to give her a bone
Niggas should be embarrassed I caught a Redeye to Paris
Eyes red from smokin' the hash
Ashy to classy, I'm nasty pass me it
Bitch and I smash it, pass me a tab of some acid
Pass me the globe and I trot that bitch
Like you know what the best is
You hardly bent, I'm Harvey Dent
Put my faith in the flip, you ain't a pimp
Your reign ain't shit, you put your faith in the bitch
Saint laurent crash denims, my shit came with the rips
My flow is sick, I spit more than a retard's kiss
I'm in your bitch, gyrating my hips like I'm ravishing Rick
I'm rather sick, aha feel my vibe, catchin' my drift
I wore a rubber that night, so that cannot be my kid
Do as I say and get out, follow my actions and live

I get love from the north and the west
Love from the south and the east
It's a zombie attack you bitches
We don't care about the police
I know you heard about the single
And you know about the album that I'm about to release
That's why I'm in Paris
Taking pics with the girls outside on the streets
There will never be another like me, rep my gang 'til I D.I.E
And I don't wanna get buried in a grave
Burn me and throw my ashes in the sea (amen)
Hennessey and Coke in the cup
And Pierre got me the weed and the Rizlas
I'm gonna smoke my spliff 'til it gets to the roach and it burns my fingers
Watch the rude boy spit now
Musical chairs make a man sit down
Any size, little rave or a big crowd
Somebody's gonna die here like Chris Brown
Picture me broke in the hood
On the run from the police, up to no good
Driving with no license, two packs in the passenger seat, looking like Suge
Fuck that, I've gotta get paid I swear
I'm tryn'a be the hustler of the year
I've been killing it for lots of years
Put money on my head, that's stocks and shares
I put the work in, I go too hard
Business man with no business card
Take a good look right now, the last time you see a rude boy like me spitting these bars

Yo shawty on my wood wood
Ay it ain't no problem cause we smokin' on that good good
Light one for my niggas who represent the hood hood
You know we smokin' that fire, she light the wood
Dawg I just fuck her good
Yo shawty on my wood wood
Ay it ain't no problem cause we smokin' on that good good
Light one for my niggas who represent the hood hood

Ain't nothing to a G, pussy come, pussy go
Take a hit I know you with it, take a sniff I bet you with it
More money, more probs,
 more grams and more hoes
From my mind, creep with me
Third eye frequency like Jesus be
I'm tryna free the slaves, young minds, bad brains
No shame, no history, no name
I want mine, no rights I'm not blind
Five letters; ""Fuck U,"" a vendetta
If she don't suck dick, useless not with her
I'm saying we the hope, I'm saying we the dopest
Every new trend these artists jump 
like ropes
I tie around your neck nigga, choke nigga choke

Is you gon' cry or die, run and hide
Or look the reaper in his eyes and fight for your life
I consider mine self-righteous suicide
Baby wipe those tears, please dry your eyes
Dying ain't the shit but it's pleasant
And why ever would you want to live forever?
Better off dead, just thought I would mention

If labels are in a panic, rap should be reprimanded
I rap like I'm on a canvas, keep treading, 
Keith Haring
Call Betty up, side chick or tele-slut
Spark the 
sinsemilla
, I dig the stench like a sixth sense
Laid shorty like marble floor, connoisseurs
Call it karma killing or we call it war, my conscious be nonsensical
Instrumentals but breaking them all for those
Who can't grasp, another body leaving his soul
So God bless the dead, Juice made them die and
Meech got the dreads, one before my bread
So you say who is he, Belligerent, move away
Got many maneuvers I break you in two, today nigga
Really are you inferior to my mirror, you slipping
Aware that I'm tripping, don't even give me reason to listen to rap
I rap talent with my pants sagging
Middle finger to the law, excuse my bad habit

Is you gon' cry or die, run and hide
Or look the reaper in his eyes and fight for your life
I consider mine self-righteous suicide
Baby wipe those tears, please dry your eyes
Dying ain't the shit but it's pleasant
And why ever would you want to live forever?
Better off dead, just thought I would mention

– Yeah, uhm, so one time it was early in the morning and I said, why don't I just roll a blunt? And yeah, I definitely rolled that blunt. It was really tasty I'd say, you know? 
Sour diesel
. Um, I got really high and I wanted to smoke another one. So I said, hey, bro, are you tryna smoke weed? Cause I got a spliff ""Yeah, son, tryna smoke this weed. You know...uhm, I got 5 on it"" Five? Nigga, five dollars? That can't even get you a burger cuz, with cheese! ""Yeah, I know something, but uhh, I'm tryna get high too."" Yeah, man you can go smoke regs over there with Craig and them cause I be smoking that good weed mothafucka. Get higher fucking money bitch, like 20 dollars or something. What you gonna do with that? ""Aight man, I'm gonna go over there and try to buy like 10 dollars, you know what I'm saying? Could throw us down, you know what I'm saying? We should smoke"" Uhh, okay, sure. I'll see you in hell

Did U Ever Think,Day of the Dead EP,2015.0,"Me and my faction
Don’t like asking questions strictly blunt sessions
We can order dead man you must have a death wish
I kill you with these bars that’s more like a death sentence
I promise you that I’m type demented
My mind state? Crime infested
I think I lost myself three years ago still tryna catch it
Cut my own head off ‘cuz I needed to balance
Ego too big to manage
Not to kill a nigga everyday probably my biggest challenge
Imagine if I was selfish and kept away all this talent
Didn’t think it, never spat it
I probably put skullied down an gatted, robbing local scammers
That’s all for credit cut in every traffic
I love to be alone, I’m comfy in the casket
To me it’s like a hammock
Never bow to any challenge, catch case
Filled with rage, I split they face, I’m deranged
Cannot be tamed, I break they cage
When in range, I twist they face with six inch blades
Back again, I’m Dirt Cobain, the golden fangs
I kill you and wear blood stained shirt to your wake
Got me around crossed-eyes like ""Hey hey hey""

The epitome of greatness
Stay stiff me and my niggas about to make shift
Patience feel the rhythm and the cadence
Got no time for hate statements
They try to keep the beast caged in that’s why we ragin’
Sittin’ on some heat that could probably melt a glacier
Fire man could’ve walked a mile in these blazers
They know my element
Been wondering where the hell I been
Tryna’ put the fire out I came back definite
Feelin’ like a mouse in a house full of elephants
Niggas run they mouth but they never this eloquent
I’m high-definitely. To your bitch, for she always represent me
She wanna kick it with the Beast Coast resident
Pockets full of white excellence
Said she tryna jiggy with a couple black menaces
‘Cause we got bars and got it locked in these sentences
All these bitches jailbait keep your guard up for hells sake
Open up your cell gate, cell block three eyes see Joe like G.I
Commander in chief
Don’t ask me why I be high
More buzz and more honeys than a beehive
The Badmon, young kingpin
I move dope with that ink pen
Been up all year—my third eye ain’t even blinkin'
With this flow, it’s guarantee to leave you sinking
And this 'dro guaranteed to leave you thinking
No warranty, just disorderly conduct
For an Erick Arc Elliot-presented product
All the stars is lined up 'bout to turn on the horizons
The Beast Coast connection still deep like Verizon

Did you ever think that you would be this real?
Did you ever think that you would get a deal?
Did you ever think that you would be this slick?
Did you ever think that you would be the shit?
C’mon
Did you ever think that you would be this real?
Did you ever think that you would get a deal?
Did you ever think that you would be this slick?
Did you ever think that you would be the shit?
C’mon

I done seen dark sour demons playing for keep cards
But be smart, this game will eat your weak heart
Divine source liberate a dry corpse
Design her thoughts help me manuever life’s course
You play hard, show your facade you get squashed
Bumblebee niggas be frontin’ they stings sharp
But they fuckin’ flowers God’s son you get devoured
Super power, Clark Kent, on top of a tower
Looking down, peeping the town
What’s going around bump their feeble sound
Submerge your crown
Making you drown but still I rise and synchronize
So I can read the signs chase the prize
Breaking these lego niggas back down to size
Get yo piece of pie, it’s supper time
I’m eating mine I’m one of a kind
A present prince from past tribes
We live in troubled times
Internal crime done by the same guys we trust our lives
Pray for demise
I’m painting, let me do my thing
No time for ? I’m seventeen
Bumping they music will leave you stupid like heroine
Rather medicine, that sticky
That proper sediment for betterment

The truest of students a true instance to
Too egotistical
To respect your principal or your principles
I might smack a teacher while I read the rules
Tell ‘em Blue’s Clues
Cut his noose loose let him hang high ‘till he doo doo
Prune juice, no shit, couple screws loose
Flawed mentally but there’s no sympathy
When I begin this rapping this image of me was imminent
Prevalence to avoid the censorship I sense the element
Niggas talking reckless only motivates the presidents
Nigga even fuck the presidents said it for the hell of it
Dead boy delegate stashed like Tom Selleck
Should I relish in that endeavor platinum level
Gold chains and 
flipping grams like capo era
I touch basics I hate it when niggas make these blank statements
Why check before I’m banking on your greatness

Did you ever think that you would be this real?
Did you ever think that you would get a deal?
Did you ever think that you would be this slick?
Did you ever think that you would be the shit?
C’mon
Did you ever think that you would be this real?

We could never be in love but we could play pretend
Cruel intentions just spread 'em
And let a nigga in, girl, let a nigga in

I'm witty, jiggy, is the baddest of the bunch
LSD on my tongue then I tongue kiss her

Just me and a rusty burner
Ah, ah, ah, shout out to Shmurda
Shout out to Rowdy, my mind is cloudy
Stay with iron round me like Robert Downey
Don’t you doubt me, King like LeBron watch me switch my mouthpiece
Running through knots
Couple karats in my mouth like “What’s up, Doc?”
I be talking to my 9 like “What’s up, Glock?”
I flirt with death, the drugs heighten' my paranoia
But that's what the, acid taught us
You got a better chance doing laps in piranha waters
Hide your daughters, join a cult, let’s have an orgy

Still not the father, that’s word to Maury
Revolver ring six times like Robert Horry (and one!)

Invest in a vest when you’re from those slums
LSD amazing, sour kush fragrance

40 acres and a pearl white slave bitch

You run away from your problems
Batty boy, then you gon face this
Lord knows I wanna erase him
Take him to a level of darkness he ain’t been
Remove the safety
Can I end up in the state pen with some statements
Hard time behind these bars, working the grave shift
Motherfucker we made it, ain’t it amazin’?
Nigga I had to suffer for this, lost every lover for this
Every night I argue with my mother for this
Acid was an escape, not a way to the bank
Not a phase, not a trend, it was the means to my ends
I don’t need no friends
All I need is this gat, all I need is this Henn
All I need is this pad, all I need is this pen, motherfucker

Recognize genius, still the same motive
No I'm not bogus, everybody taking notice
Just me and my opponents
Fuck the cops, they a bunch of cronies
Just save a little weed for the morning
This is the environment we raised in
When you try to break out but you're caged in
Smoking hella weed, this my motivation
Zombies doing numbers, I promised a combination
This is for the music, fill it with the hatred
But only real niggas know how good to make it
I been a fan of rap before I was a fan of being black
Now I'm famous, got family, no fantasy in that
My niggas ain't scared to deploy
When destroyed off the cannabinoid
I'm out-of-body like I'm Enter the Void
In first class, God loving your boy
My employees got hella report but now enjoying the allure of it
Damn, why are we so sure of it?
Even when you make mistakes, man they all love it
The allure of it, why are we so sure of it?
Even when you make mistakes, man they all love it
Read more into things, question all that remains
Who was living before with clean water to drink
We avoided to think
But this a nation of lost souls
So I'll meet you at the crossroads

Rest in peace STEEZy, Rest in peace Stevie
Put the cup down, y'all niggas still tryna be he?
No disrespect, but I know some of y'all
Influenced by hip hop and take it shit too far
No brains, man, just a slight change in plans
Use the mic to rule and rock and choose to stand
No cause ya flaws
We truth that's all
You could rap all you all you want with no message involved
I'll be out in grass meditate in Nepal
I to pray God God hear me or the devil I call
I swear I said it before, y'all I ain't ready for war
Misjudged, misguided, not a ounce of quitter
Nah, true survivor
Niggas do drugs but ya mind still basic psychedelics wasted
Time can't save ya
Cop killer if ya wanna come up in my face with that nonsense
Go Thrilla like Mike Jack, bodega be that nigga
Been in straight jacket
Let my mind think backwards
Roll a backwood, pass it before load this Mac
And let this whole clip pack em ask a question
Like how we grow up in a system
Filled with hate and oppression
And where we going when our pops and moms would left?

When am I even good enough? Acknowledge your friends
Sometimes things get broken and we argue again

I'll explain it as takin' cash on culture from the poachers
Scopin' everything I have, ignorin' all the bullshit that made me mad
Killin' coral reefs, smoking weed too fast
Almost got skipped, bitch I read too fast, I don't bleach my past
These are the titles G's supposed to have, cold in the summer
Sweatin' bullets out on Flatbush Ave
Spirit like I got a platinum plaque, modern acrobat, the mass effect
I sharp shoot 'em, make them tap the mat, so accurate
We represent the illest seniors, small demeaners
Tellin' lies inside this room of cheaters
Even at the stage of a fetus, I reclaim to repeat this to all my demons
That's pigeon-holin' your genius and feedin' right into weakness
How can he write his thesis? He don't believe in Jesus
Sweetness, I'm almost speechless, for our future, egregious
We gotta pick up the pieces shawty, I'm familiar with pain
Used to play by myself when they considered it lame
Do this thing by yourself, nothing is ever obtained
Introverted but I’m emergin' the spark to the flames
I won't harp on a thing
I won't causin' the blame, but it's hard to obtain

I wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash
Wanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag
Wanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big

Wanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag
Wanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big
Bringing champagne home, 'long as I could get a swig

A real friend'll kill you if you asked him to
Instead of stabbing on the back of you
Just trying to get ahead
But you can't spend a dime if you work yourself dead
We are so deep in love with the sinner but not the sin
How could she turn my king size into a waterbed? Damn, I'm just sayin'
Kick her out the crib and scream, ""Baby, come back""
Then kick her out again—I'm just crazy like that
Bitches fall in love with a nigga out of his mind
And I fall so deep into lust with a chick with a big behind
My ex left cause I ain't got no hits
I heard her new boyfriend lumpin' her up with his fists
But hey, you got what you asked for, I'm petty as shit
That's some food for thought, I let you do the dishes

I wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash
Wanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag
Wanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big
Bringing champagne home, 'long as I could get a swig

I'm Faizon with no love, give love with a golden glove
I'm the man with a golden gun, black man under golden sun
I'm shinin', Jack Nicholson, wishes where my nickels went
Kisses on my mistletoes, did I have a Christmas? No
But I had a misses though, believe me, shoulda vacay'd in Tahiti
Wishing you were dyin' with me, sweet as hugs and diabetes
Leave me, love me, touch me, cut me, lustin'
Fuck me, busty, dusty, old and rusted
Baby, do you mind if I revise what's in your mind?
You see my call declined because a certain point in time
I'm hopin' every line it hits like millimeter nine
You beggin' me to change, that is a penny to a dime
The realness in my spirit always gets you every time
Optimistic like Optimus, we ain't even reached our prime
Roses are red and violence leads to violins
End of discussion, I hope that we could still be friends

Don't take this shit for granted, I'm blessed just like my granny
Shout out my Uncle Mannie, hey, hi, I hope you winnin'
Gia, I hope you listenin'
And Tommy hold your head, man fuck your heart condition
Rihanna like my big momma, we call Penny Big Momma
She like a hundred years old, that's a real old timer
Uncle Karl you in a better place
Just know the pictures that you took gon' live forever and a motherfuckin' day
Rest in peace Uncle Rob, we miss you, bless your heart
Rihanna and my grandmomma took me in from the start
Aunt Marie beatin' cancer, givin' everything she had
My cousin Calvin showed me swag, my cousin Hebrew showed me straps
Me and J used to hustle, he had that white, I had that green
Who got them pills? We in Fort Greene, lil niggas on the scene
God had four knives, that's one for each pocket
Gonna need nine lives if you get outta pocket
If I see cousin James, I'll knock his eye out his socket
Diamante hold me down like I ain't got a wallet
Rest in peace to my sweet great-grandma Grace
I wish my momma was alive, if I could see her face

I'm moving on, they say I'm different now
Call investigation, this a perp
Deem it certain, screaming red alert
Most you suckers gotta make it work
Just remember where you heard it first
Problematic shit get automatic
Fucking cowards, they don't want no static
I'm from the towers, Flatbush full of power
Came up selling sour, making thousands
Came up selling sour, making thousands
Came up selling sour, making thousands

Fleezus Christ, don't say my name in vain
Fire, brimstone, acid rain
Watch me turn the crowd into a Spartan scene
Mosh pit, then I'm Moses, part the sea

I think I'm back up on them drugs again
Acid, acid, acid, acid, yah
I think I'm back up on them drugs again

Yeah I see the 12
I don't want to see the cell
You won't see me in some nooses
Young and reckless, with the movements
Fix yourself up nigga, what you doing?

Keep these haters blocked, you hear the shots
I'm not just saying Pac catered to relatable and the shaded ones

Man fuck that (*mumbles*) that mumble rap
It's that skully low rumble rap
I'll do 50 years
If the police find what's inside my duffle bag
Moma shoulda named me Trouble Man
Got shrooms, I ain't talking truffles and
Got sheets, I ain't talking slumbers and
Rat-tat-tat, slide up in your trap
Like Kramer, in through your window like Bruh Man
Now the pigs in my head like I'm Harley Quinn

It's Meechy Dark, still not the father bitch

Keeping hundreds in the shoe box
Straight cash pop a few thots

Dirty money clean money, niggas see the difference
Tell the bartender leave some liquor for my niggas
Streets full of wolves so my appetite grew
I was hungry for this rap shit way back in high school
Motivated, knocked somebody off to break the rule
Coordinated mind-frame slaughtering your view
Smoking on this green trees, I don't get the blues

Working three jobs, I ain't want to buy the purp

Used to smoke mad weed before my grandma went to church
Had no ID, hip-hop before I started bumping Eazy-E
When ringtones was the hot shit
And B.I.G. on my conscience when I spit
NYPD on my dick since I've been
Fornicating, investigations
Don't got no patience, all this bread I'm making
Used to fuck bad bitches when my grandma's on vacation
Call a bitch over, then she dipped for the weekend
Couple safes in my brib, two phones and the rocket
Crip sets on the ave like a LA Dodger
Juice man, piff man with the grams, man

I cracked the canvas and cursed it

But a picture ain't perfect
What is proper and purpose?
Leaving families hurting
She don't trust me at all
She put a lock on her purses
Part of me don't deserve ya'
Pardon bruh, I was nervous and this is a new beginning
We fly so come feel the turbulence
Never bow to that serpent
Dreamed and found out I'm worth it
Soul circuit, love lurking and close curtains
And I be that bigger person
And this my seed, she nurse it
I stimulate her mind, she challenge me while we rehearse it
Smoking on this weed got me feeling like a wordsmith

Puff puff, homie rest up
Just us against the world
Finger fuck it like my nine bustin'
It's no discussion, quit the rushin'
If D's coming get the flushing', all of a sudden
Heard you was fucking with other niggas
I ain't bluffing, locked up, now luxed up
Handcuffed, now hand cuff
Unfaithful bitch love the taste of dick
Only faithful to my bros
My rights and my wrongs
Some nights I play, 2Pac and zone
Pop on my phone, selling and flipping
Bounce to my own
True to the beat, LSD by the sheet
My flow is part of the beat
I know it's hard to believe that you're part of the seed
Sometimes it's hard to breath

Look at these ears, look at this hairline
But, why don't you think you're the father?
Because, it's been a time where I've went over to  house
And it's been twelve guys in there
And there's a bottle of gin, and there's things being rolled up
We all know what I'm talking about
You, first of all, are a liar
You're dumb as a box of rocks
Number four in your class? I don't think so
I have the high school transcript to prove it
Okay, well show me! I'm not trying to hear none of that
That's not putting food on Keyshawn's table
Or clothes on her back
Maury, Maury, Maury, I'd just like to say

Metaphysics, religious scripture, read the picture
Participating, hate the negative, we'll get ya
Look inside your soul, meet your maker, I suppose
In Jamaica, blowing Os, Cali niggas cutthroat
Beast Coast nigga, yeah, we've been on
Trippy motherfucker, up and down, ping-pong
Bulletproof from the roof, third eye strong
King of my own, that throne'll leave you thorny crowned
Crucify, getting shitted by your own
The universe, everywhere I roam is my home
To some, I suppose, uranium explode
Leaving kids disfigured, they meant to just a figment
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Do it for the culture, that pop shit over
Wasn't for A$AP, the radio would make me throw up
Here's the reality, I plead my insanity
I don't give a fuck if you rap niggas don't like me
Same old nigga, rubber bands and a white tee
No chain on, gold teeth, blowing Yoshi (Yoshi!)
Issa, AK, do it for the whole team
YFG, zombie niggas reign supreme
Prince my little yout, growin faster than my buzz
Last week overseas, steady getting love
Signing out, Juice man, peace, ganja, blood

Got a job, got to rob, black mask, black noise
Black ball, black hoodie back on my back, boy
My axe raw, never pack gats, I pack poise
I back smack niggas 'til I'm back on the tabloids
Everything I knew 'bout jealousy and wicked niggas
We don't need no shootouts
Part of me, I'm part of poverty, the streets father me love
Hesitate to tell the truth cause only part of me was
Confident when the skoma lit
My crew move anonymous over units, assemble platoons to form a conglomerate
Blood-rushing concussions ain't nothing
You don't have to be a nigga to consume a substance
But pour us a bottle, formula is to follow
Trippy chick Love Lucy like Ricky Ricardo
Capable of crashing Internet without the intellect
Tell him fuck you to his face in case it's never indirect
See, my mother struggled, so I never loved another like her
Despite the human cycle, entice a rap revival
I've been here, my marketing plans are well off
My haters on the dick, advise for you to get off
Papa was a Rolling Stone waiting for that mobile phone
And my homies know, call my bluff
Who will hold the throne? Probably me
The prophecy is I see, it's not a dream
On the MPC, it's sending you shots to your self-esteem

When you got the juice, you got to move like the bishops do
Even if that means killing every nigga in your crew
I'm the type to screw over anyone to make a move
Paper I pursue, 
looking for a big head, brunette, Betty Boop
She can be black-and-white just like the cartoon, I ain't picky
No invite to the VMAs cause they knew I was gonna shoot this shit up
Like sticky fingers on the trigger and it's getting itchy
I like my sex hot, sticky, sweat dripping
Kinky, finger-licking bitches fuck with me
Yet they honor me cause of my honesty
Cause honestly, I ain't shit, I'm just being honest, B
All-red suit on Suge Knights, I'm Nino Browning
Am I my brother's keeper? No, nigga, I’m only childing
No sleep 'til Brooklyn,
 so I sew open my eyelids

The wildest Brooklyn nigga since Christopher Wallace

Twistin' that real good
Bomb kush, face numb, titties; life's good

Take her to the crib, let it snow, snow
Line up her line then she blow, blow
She's a fiend for the green
Fuck my team for my mean green scheme
Left my balls on her chin, now she gone with the wind
Next week, call up her friend
Python striking again
Everything's a go, rolls full of dough
Case full of rolls, sour diesel on my flow
Zombies, straight fuckin' it up my bitches
As you fuckin up what you be lovin it up
I be fuckin up guts, straight knuck and buck

The night sneaks up but today won’t you play with me

Well let's add sixty to it
Million miles in the sky
Baby girl you leakin' fluid
And slowly her legs divide
As she work her way into it
Simple math, weed and hash
Thirteen tabs in my leopard-print bag
Ever make love in a casket?
Spit in her mouth cause she like it nasty
I go deep, you tug my sheets
Then you get to screaming and scratching
I be a fool, to put my pride aside
For superficial women
You brought you a swimming pool?
Guess what girl, I'm skinny dipping
Missionary, doggie, ruff ruff
Raw please, sushi
Cameras flash, throw it back
Girl let's make a movie
Bitch from L.A., but she love Brooklyn niggas
Said she got Plan B
So I cums in the middle
Her best friend is a freak, she try to hide it
A little G, throw up the peace sign with a tongue
In the middle, if she tall then I dick her down
If she thick then I pick her up
Fucked her on the first night, she call it beginner's luck

Clouds of smoke is trailin' me, but none of you compare to me
It's rare to see me rappin', bruh it's not a joke when I be actin' up
Johnny Depp, fuck a rep nigga I am deaf
I represent the limited, the militant, and the innocent
You can see it's real as shit you can taste it in your filaments
Grind got me feelin' sick, bitches got me feelin' rich
Cocaine for hors-d'oeuvres make her purr while she clears the dish

Got friends up on some other shit that'll load you right to the mothership
Say I'm egotistic while then listen you're of no relief
My shades are darker than my Benz just so you can't notice me
Jeans saggin' pants low, the anthem light a candle
After smokin' something potent, popo's on it like I own it
Like it's mine, gotta recreate my thoughts until my organs leave my side
My soul and body frozen from this higher high
I advise you pass the craft, the gift wrapping, they televise actresses
And recognize havoc when it doesn't matter what the fuck we doin'
Drama's brewin' when you live in hell
I blame this well lift this cell, heaven we prevail
My golden rule if you only knew that if you will surface that you will float

Crush a bitch up split that dutch throw the guts fill it up then roll it up

Feel that high, realize, the world is built from many lies
But sometimes I float around in my mind
Dilated eye, acid high, twenty-five
Top floor believe inside that you arrive through yourself
Feel your mind feel your body - feelin' godly
Nothin' can harm thee from twenty bags to vacuum packed
The whole platoona, greenhouses in many places
This human race is built up from what we make it
I've been dead so fuck rules and fuck haters
Or anybody that wants to claim on my dead body
Ignite the flame, smokin' lethal
All I need in this life my sour diesel
Keep my head up, let the dank roll
The high livin', three gram spliffs
Up in my livin' room with many women to consume
Boned her with my boner, boned it till she comatose
Call it overdose, leaving hoes and foes smokin' up a quarter roll
Two fingers, peace ho

Kaleidoscope eyes watch as I dematerialize
My team rolls with cohesion as we fly through broken skies
Told her the windows are your eyes, she can't hide when deep inside
And destiny is mine so I decide my own demise
Niggas ain't ahead of I, we smokin' O's you smokin' dimes
I strangle you, gouge your eyes, 'haha' as you bleed and die
I love the taste of them tears, come on, come on baby cry
Lets go free your mind, close your eyes, drift into the other side
Am I out my mind or is my mind out of I?
I can't lie, shit I impress myself sometimes
Two tabs at nine, tick tock, trip time
As the chemicals combine with my body and my mind
Oh we can forget the soul, I'm a OG, ho, so with the weed I roll
Smoke 'til these eyes glow, gold shining, I can't hide
To think they told me that we can't fly, well that's a damn lie
Cause I am that high, so when I spit from the sky
You niggas get baptized, I ain't even holy
But this gun I'm holdin' will leave you holy moly, homie
Tombstone sittin' on old money, yeah I bring a loaded bong rip
Of that bomb shit, nigga forever floatin' manifest

Dem boy want war? Get destroyed in dem Kevlar
Whole team, whole scene, whole ting
 
dead off
Anything dem a trust dey gon' sell off
Lie yah tell, some bwoy 
dem embellish
Play your position, we sentencing, not sinners
We always been hot spitters, we won't let the cops get us
Speakin' of cops, 
they shot this cop on my block
They said you know what time it is? I 
guess
 he ain't had no watch
Bitches follow, niggas watch, in the game, hit a spot
For the fame, money more than a game, than a watch
Hit a spot, on your block, let me dig up in your pocket
Let me stack up on your option, cancelling your profit

Got a problem, got a vent, got a shot, got a sin
Gotta rob, gotta spend, is it you? Is it him?
Is it us? Is it them? Wonder how we make amends
Watch how they circle the block, hate us cause of our skin
Got a problem, got a vent, got a shot, got a sin
Gotta rob, gotta spend, is it you? Is it him?
Is it us? Is it them? Wonder how we make amends
Watch how they circle the block, hate us cause of our skin
[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott &

In the middle of nowhere, I see happy people

I woke up this morning and I asked myself
""Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
And when I'm gone, would they remember?""
Only son of Deborah, born in late December
Would my women cry for me when they get the news
That they future baby daddy, hanging from a noose?
I don't wanna cry, gotta be a better way
Don't ever want to see her die, so I found an escape
Should I leap in head first off the fire escape
Or should I take the easy way, shoot myself in the face?
I can't really explain
What got me feelin' this way
To all my fans, I'm truly sorry that I have to end it
But keep your minds open and my verses in your memory
In disbelieve, at least I made it to a quarter century
Just tryna give you a good ending for the documentary
I won't give you reasons why I had to do it
Just know I'm going through it, and I really had to do it
Get it together, fuck is you doin'?
(And all of this shit will be gone)
God got my number blocked, my calls, he never answered
Who's to blame: myself, the bullet or the handgun?
The night time's the hardest time to be alive
Only sleepin' with women I love, I got insomnia
I got a bad case of 4 A.M. regrets
You know, like when you can't sleep, layin' in your bed
Replaying all them thangs, you wish you never did
Voices in my head, sleep paralysis
Countin' sheep all week, I'm half-past dead, vision clouded
Voices whispers, are they talkin' about me?",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-trapped-lyrics
Crown,Vacation in Hell,2018.0,"I’ve been gloomin', and doomin' so long
I don't think I can carry on down
This long and winding road now
Can't you see that doom's been, gloomin' too long?
But I don't doubt we can stick it out
So when you hold me, hold me closer
Severed is the head that wears the crown

Bleedin' through people to see these stars
I'm needed in cities large
Look down, tote out, break down these walls
A stupid man could evolve
Losers told me I wouldn't be on the Earth for this long
My resurgence was strong, what do I do this for?
Gotta relieve, gotta release, everything beautiful
My fabric needs, kiss my niece, money don't soothe the soul
Ain't nobody perfect anyway, mama poured a glass of Minute Maid
Rid me from the evils thataway, the ones I gotta say

We could start a commotion
We can't help it, it's perpetual motion (motion)
It's just a drop in the ocean (ocean)
My crown of thorns in the city of roses, yeah

No one gets out alive
So we livin' like we already died
No one will ever understand but the sky
Sometimes it's hard to focus with these voices inside the mind
I'm a demon to some, I'm a angel to others
Gotta die for what you love or love until it kills you
Don't be the type to talk about shit and not live it
I manifested every single one of my visions
So I only blame myself when I don't make it to the finish
Please don't let this perception become your reflection
Uh, but excuse my aggression 'cause my tribe called for questions
If I'm made in God's image, tell me why am I blemished?
Simple question, huh, quite perplexin'
Them snakes will say they love you but hate you, that's type deceptive
My voice a controlled substance, ingest this
Might fuck around and fail your drug test, reckless

Babel,UnKnown,2017.0,"It's been said that when you're one step ahead of the crowd, you're a genius!
When you're two steps ahead, you're a crackpot
In this era of discovering suddenly hundreds and hundreds of exoplanets
You know planets that are like Earth that can conceivably support life
That’s a major discovery, you’ve got to admit
In terms of the probability of life being discovered

Lot of niggas never get through
A lot of niggas never get you
Thanks for the compliments
Only boosted my confidence
Make tunes for the in-tune
Smoke joints when I skip school
Like I shot from a pistol
Christians 'cause they pissed too
On point can’t see that wealth
And I wonder if I could ever just be myself

Alter perceptions, reality of questions
Psychedelic mushrooms, DMT sessions
I’m on another trip, ain't gotta get to stepping
Your windows in your eyes, the doors to perception
Broken homes, broken souls
Hurricanes, overdose
Crowded jails, for the weed sales
Conspiracies and casualties
Universal consciousness
My third eye swollen like boxing mitts
I ain’t a Muslim 'cause my beard so thick
Inspired by the light, the creator's gift
Sometimes I feel like I cease to exist
In the physical trapped in my head
Tryna open vaults back from the dead
You’s a God, just what I say

Say, one day I was okay
'Til a nigga decided to look it both ways
I never got a chance never co-paid
Chilling with the fam and the homies
Niggas wanna talk reckless
Don’t rely on the police to protect us
Nigga gimme your watch, your bitch, and your necklace
Then I'm taking your life forget your inception
A healthy track record

This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page
If yo walk don’t match yo talk then we on a different page
This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page
If yo walk don’t match yo talk then we on a different page
This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page

I'm fucking focused, I'm talking shit cause you need to know this

Oh, now you fucking noticed?
You fucking bogus, I should hire my man to smoke you

Dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the clique
I'm lit, she on my dick
Probably cause my flow timeless
I'm Flee, must I remind you
Darko, zombie gang, walking carcass
My Jordans so old, they need walkers
Pardon as I lay back and spark this
Chick with me, caked up, nice titties
Dog, I take a bite out of Hello Kitty
Lick licky, it must be the liquor in me
She suck so hard, she gave my dick hickies
Always pull out, even with a rubber
Some women are extra fertile
And all my niggas get a slice like the ninja turtles

Ass fat, passed that
Head so good, that's an asset
Old boy don't treat you right
Play you like a toy, can't sleep tonight
Juicy wet, dripping wet
Juicee beat it up like a long set, long breaths
I stroke it, soaking good like the ocean
I blow it down
Weed so loud, never tone it down

I don't smoke cigars, but aw, fuck it, why not
Used to be a nigga, now I'm still a nigga, rolling
When I move the rollers
If you haven't noticed, I don't listen what they told us
Cause a nigga too focused
When I'm overseas, expensive entertainment
Eloquence runs through me like the rain did
Pride ain't do much for me, but the pain did
Pussy so good, I want to frame it
Sumptuous, ain't it
Material hearts, well this one is gold-plated
Also, I hate when niggas invite me to car shows
Rather invest my own money in the bar codes
Distributing music
Quick to take a piss in your jacuzzi
Champagne got me feeling woozy
Roll one before I catch my flight
That OG had me feeling light

I need a vacation!
Where you going? (My nigga, where you going?)

London, Paris, Tokyo world tour

Stand for something, get wild for something, get high for suffering
Even if you gotta die for something

And can't side with the youth, can't side with the blind
They singing to me, on the line of scrimmage
Dog, I don't even get it, Power from beginning
All season Tommy Egan, you know a nigga fiendin'
When his weed is per diem (you must be European)
So whatever your vice is, don't make it tarnish the price list
My halo growing brightly, no rap shit entice me
The on and off light switch, bitch
Focus on your own shit instead of being nosy
And know, the rap Moses
Orchestratin purpose partly cause I got focused
So is the cultural remarkable on the soul on to tour the globe
With his hands on a .44 but that ain't what I voted for

Being yourself is like a superpower these days
Money and wealth is like a superpower these days
Fire 'pon yuh head top—lead shower these days

Can't follow me, numero uno upon a galaxy, it's blasphemy
They talk about it, living all these fallacies
I got that cavarly, don't make me split up your anatomy
I get her sad or sappy cause they sabotage her artistry
Pardon me, you're boring me, my rhymes is like some sorcery
Gravity holdin me, gotta get my shit in order, B
There's more to me than what you see or choose to believe in
This world is backwards, we're still in shackles
Designed to be confused, they only use blacks
When describing negative views only show blacks
When they violent in their views
It's more than that, they replace the phones with they homes
Parents be gone, don't teach their kids right or wrong
Not to be confused with this, this, or that one
My swag won, bad since this Michael Jackson
Assassinated, all my heroes are in cages
It's modern slavin', no money or label could take 'em
My name out on the table, these dudes is fables
I spread my wings so I can fly, just like an angel
My soul in sync with the universe and I'ma teach it
Lacking substance, I hope you seek it
All these followers but no one leading, it's so deceiving
This ain't about the land of freedom, the richest lead 'em
Gender equality? What about human equality?
Loving is one, and the future's looking cloudy
So they poison the water, poison the mind, poison the heart
Take all the land and rip it apart
Racism's still alive, they just be concealing it
Shout out to Kane, and all my niggas in the bin
And so it seems, gotta lead the youth to reach they dreams
No disrespect, it's like a generation disconnect
Logging in, all I see is hate up on the internet
Where's the love? They're scared of love, I always gotta give it back

I need a vacation!
Where you going? (My nigga, where you going?)

Never ask for shit and her ego is enormous
Remember, she's a bitch, so of course a nigga dog her

Dissect it and do forensics and leave without a blemish
Smoking on headband, overviewing the earth
Life is a fifty-fifty, you know, gift and the curse
How deep is too deep, cause I done seen the bottom
Feels like the earth is in my reach because that's how high I've gotten
I dispose of you foes and these shows through the flows
Pop a tab and crush the globe as my third eye glows

And now she wanna hold my hand and shit

Devil & Us,D.R.U.G.S.,2012.0,"Man I feel worthless, a good purchase
Abiding by the law, good purp and good purpose
I ain't perfect, nobody on this earth is
Sweeter than the cherry of a virgin
Got me out the loop like this cursive
Eyes blink, nervous, words slur lurkin a wordsmith
And the worst is, kinda perturbed bitch
If you ain't talking 'bout money I'm allergic
Six feet deep nigga where the dirt is
And bad bitches keep them guns inside they purses
The devil tongue got me sprung through these verses
If I'm the number one somethin' gotta surface
Grade school played a fool, did the math on it
Hella blind to these hoes so I passed on it
Show them titties girls put my autograph on it
Broken dreams dog, rappin' with a cast on it
Lyrical child of the indigo
Heathens pray to god, I'm only 'bout the literal
I can see your third eye, talk about a miracle
Take a walk in my shoes, most of you just tippy-toe
Time feelin' awesome engraved in my coffin
One whiff will make you pause, make you nauseous
Then I'm livin' proof ask Luke where the force is
Bury me a G, tailored suit lookin' gorgeous
Floorless, burn spliffs like I forfeit
Shut your eyes and enjoy the endorphins
Deep seas yuh, swimmin' with the dolphins
Back it up please proceed to move with caution
There's no facade, the zombies is the squad
Christian is the call but they never pray to god
If victory is war then we never met 'em
If you dancin' with the devil then I'm walkin' on the stars


Frog skin glasses, grippin' fat asses
My style surpasses, finger to the masses
Heron samples tryna make examples
All the wack rappers talking it tryna make examples
Young ass nigga where your money at nigga
Spit that gudda rap nigga, get ya mummy wrapped nigga
Pocket full of stones, leave blood in the floor
Blood stains on the wall blood rains in the morgue
I'm rotten, I'm stiff
Welcome to the underworld life's a bitch
A corpse, a carcass
Middle finger to the world in my new shhhh
It's grimy, it's gudda
Real shit just a bad motherfucker
Devolved, deceased
Bare arms see the ankh and believe
Bear stroll, come and walk with a beast
Drink beer so a nigga kinda slur when he speak
Requiem the dead never walks so we never in
Psilocybin high I'm on another binge
Inny mini miney mo, a lot of ya'll niggas ain't built for the throne
Quote me if I'm wrong, levelheaded, headstrong
Drink your lix of holy water to build up
Ayahuasca, Yopo, I'm so gone
My soul's worn, I'm so drawn, I'm so torn
Seize the moment seize rye seed the omen
Juice so hard, Ceaser, Roman
They swear I'm on the deep end
But it all depends if they comprehend
Killa' rap shit, nick name exorcism
Protected by the gods, trill shit no religion


High beyond biblical proportions
Told a catholic priest, ""Bible paper burn awesome.""
Open my eyes and view the ceiling from my coffin
Why are you surprised that I paint these vivid portraits?
Staring in my vanity as I sit and plot another casualty
Higher than a meth head on a trampoline
I trample these beats like a tyrant, beast
Eats anything that bleeds, feast on the soul of these
I'm quick to tell a ho ""at ease"", I'm blowin' leaves
Spittin' razor blades, tongue flip, flesh lacerate
Every day is halloween, wrap you up in masking tape
Drag you to the ocean floor body wash on Jersey Shore
Now you got a situation, death is chasin' while you waitin'
I plot your fate, and politic while sharing blunts with Satan
I drink a keg of acid spit that in angels faces
See you're a mere mortal so there is no relation
On the highway to hell speedin' while I'm masturbatin'
With a thick witch, big tits, and her craft's amazin'
Make her hit this big spliffs, of the cali raisin
Don't waste a drop, she swallow when I'm ejaculating'
And I'm sittin' mean OG like I'm Papi Mason
A glass of virgin blood and about a hundred blunts
Here to bring the fall just like the end of summer does
Life is a race well I already won it, cuz

Pray that you never die, don't dare to be deemed the highest
Our right is founded by liars, righteous as my suppliers
They wonder where my supply is (Nigga, where them beats?)
Fuck a feature, my ether is equal to each of your own
Embodied the balance of the world on my shoulders alone
But God bless America, my Gs go hard
Gs make dreams and these grams make gods
I am so compelled, might as well proceed another step
Never took a L, still fresh without the double X
Manson, ransom, artificial anthems
Ladies say he handsome, these niggas throwing tantrums
Tripping to existence is often labeled as miscreants
Cause we position it different, real hard to make sense of it
Record labels making sense, we sensitive
Now we acting senseless, fuck you, Architect for president

I'm on my freeze time, leaping in and out of portal shit
You on your prick your finger from a thorn, mere mortal shit
I'm on my Heath Ledger, I can't get my mind in order shit
Hitler at a bar mitzvah, torturous, slaughter shit
I am really that nigga, call it quits, get off my dick
Give a camera the finger every time I hear a flick
The code has been cracked and I am the glitch, do you hear this shit
Like a rabbit turd, I swing on a track absurd
My rhyme schemes and my bars infinite
I hear your shit and get a little narcoleptic
I admit you're kind of boring, I was out touring
Stroking kittens with dimples that remind me of Lauren
London on Thursday, Sunday I'm New Yorking
Brooklyn be the birthplace, Kings County caucus
Cut the malarkey, y-y-you don't want no problems
Or drama, with zombies, get off me
Some may say seeing him's like seeing God
I see through all your transparency, oversee your façade
Dog, I raise your card like the paintings of them hounds playing poker
I'm Cesar Millan in the background taking notes
The potent, smoke up, hoes on my scrotum
Now the idle niggas always higher on the totem
I go son, haters like hoes, they just wanna blow us
With them calico bullet holes in my

My team, supreme, stay clean, lyrical dreams, zombie regime

On since I was born, no such thing as relapse

Yo
I got a vision Imma die before 40
At 20/20 my vision is blurred
Trying to be the GOAT, without the curry
These current rappers is worried
They nervous, they want me hurried
Hauled away, dead and buried
Like Bernie, I keep the MAC
The present I'm not receiving, the future just fades to black
No racing against the past
No sheep in my wolf pack
I'm proud to be Latino
Homie, that's a fact
Line for line, no lies, my nigga that's action rap
Fuck a swag, fuck a fashion
I been there straight out the womb
Kill for bills, even brides say R.I.P. to the groom
Choke a broom, street sweep you
Right across the room
My eses calling me loco,
 my white boys calling my loom doom
Motherfucker
Boom boom boom
Motherfucker
Motherfucker my favorite word
When I started I was serious
Picture me now, I move mountains
I keep it quiet, imagine making a sound

Big blunt nigga
Big skunk nigga
Wax that, dab that, puff puff nigga
Fuck that, gotta shooter and we pop back
Fix that, you're done though
Supreme Allah, I be praying to the stars
Trying to see better days, but my vision be impaired
Look at the long hair
Woo, I'm Rick Flair
Back on the block, cut me a dutch, rolled up or what?
Knot in my pants, Flee as the Devil don't know what to tell you

Living for the now
Winning in the future

Flatbush, baby
Niggas really do this
Run up in your crib like, ""Nigga we done moved in!""
And I done sold everything, LSD, good weed

Getting in for the low
Spanking another ho
Living life, new day, different state, another show

Body the industry, fuck all my enemies

Acid in the bottle, so don't ask me how I live
Trippy all day, I ain't never gonna slip
There's rules to the game, ho nigga get hip
Hip hip, like that shit that I'm spittin
And I'm on my shit, bruh
Tryna get advances and mansions
Whole family like Manson
Eating rappers like panzón
The truth, I'm the answer
The proof in the pudding
Real niggas saluting, they shooting
They said we wasn't gonna do it, drop another one
We outta heat, what the fuck you think I do this for?
The big three and every day it's like I fuckin' ball
Protect your neck and guard your grill, man
Wall off the, yeah I'm synced that means my shit is awesome
Never cared though so fuck, fuck your opinion
Smoke another bowl while I'm laughing at you critics
Ain't shit change, just the numbers on the cane
Got them 47's, eight .9 Glocks, mac-11's
Thirty eight .38's, do you get the message?

They talking but I don't hear it
Fuck in my fear, and fuck the other rappers you comparing
This shit hip with fear and any nigga you think can't even come near it
These niggas finicky, they think we gimmicky cause at first our shit was a banger
And we infiltrated the industry, it's funny cause eventually
They understand I'm not a mere man, more like an entity
Comes from a different fiber, generate radiant energy
Myself in five years, that's the only one ahead of me
I'm from the Mecca, New York, New York
Named it twice, cause we fucking beasts
Zombie gang, walking dead, no man alive
Can't fuck with thee, ya'll niggas got some nerve
We did in a week what you couldn't do in some years
Nigga you ain't learn, I'll make you bite the curb
Get it? Learning curb, amazing with these words
Already got mine, but nigga I'm taking yours
Growing pains, I never felt
Shit I been numb since I was young, the chosen one
Deborah's only son, 1989 she gave birth to a loaded gun
I know I'm blunt, speaking of blunt, I roll it up and smoke it
Some say the proof is in books, some say the proof it is hidden
I bet Eminem and a reverend will tell you Proof is in heaven
Life's a matter of preference, who's to say that hell isn't heaven?

Ain't it ironic, that the zombies runnin' the rotten apple
Haven't ran out of competition

And download it after
I reached the highest levels
Eyes red like the devil
Your chakra’s is closed up
Bitch raise your energy level
They are more than a appalling oh my godly presence
Shall I mention I'm reinventing the ideology
Of what they consider social acceptance
In every fucking sentence
My tongue's a weapon, so bitch if we kiss your head it's severed
I fucked the cougar, named Dandy Lion the Def Leopard
Scratches and paw prints, all over my garments, oh shit!

Stop tryina be Jesus, try to be better

Your weapons is flawed, from the barrel to the lever

Ready to die track 17 I'm suicidal
Ran out of dutchie so we use the paper out the bible

Pussy wet, watch it drip
The high life I'm living
It ain't sinning if you winning
Everyday is haze blunts, scandalous women
True talk, I spit the art
Hunting money is my favourite sport
I walk the walk and pussy is something I never bought
I need a bad bitch, with really good features

Dat Intro,D.R.U.G.S.,2012.0,"Do you ever notice that in the bible
Whenever god had to punish someone
Make an example, or ever god needed killing, he sent an angel?
Do you ever wonder what a creature like that must be like?
The whole existence with God, always being the one dipped in blood
Is it possible that God does not like you?
He never wanted you
In all probability he hates you!
If we are god's unwanted children then so be it!
Listen
Is it all as it seems
So unresolved so unredeemed
If I really, how will I know?

I'm no martian
I'm no goblin
I'm no vampire
I'm no problem
I'm nothing more just a figment with a force
That recognize all my thoughts
That realize I'm of awe
A long history
Historic files a mystery
The truth shall be told
The time is now
They cover up cover-ups to cover us
And there's a price on your soul of every fuckin' one of us
A all goin' war drugs, money religion
And the niggas in my hood don't want to hear it they fear it
A cold criminal, gat by the genital
Pussy by the centerfold, ravishing indigo
Appealing matter, nifty camper with a witty camp
Of niggas that’ll peal through niggas without any issue
The green in my lungs the tab on my tongue
Unravel my gun, my mind is my gun

In the land beyond living
All things are possible
It's insane to think this really all started from a molecule
Now I'm fuckin' unstoppable
My past, it was hard to do
Now my future's remarkable (ha ha ha ha)
Fuck fame nigga, can't you see the bigger picture?
Sold your soul to the devil well at least you got three wishes
Young, witty, pompous, arrogant, malicious
Blowin' kisses to the devil as I formulate these vivid lyrics
Screen motion picture shit
While I'm standing idle, fuck a title
Rather American Psycho than American Idol
Chop a clip, reload the clip, barrel hits
Like a vinyl, the universe is my shit
Knew it since I was a zygote
This shit I'm spittin' got your head spinnin' like an exorcism
When I was young I fought authority
And reject religion, learned to see from every angle
Never regret decisions at times I feel like fuck religion
Because religion is division
Ho, that's simple math, ho
Go head and fuckin' add, ho

Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-dat-intro-lyrics
Caps Lock,UnKnown,2010.0,"At 17 I told myself that I would lead a worthy life
Good cut, clean shirt, always been the nerdy type
Women never cared to think, that is what I later found
I just like what shorty likes so most of them just played around
So I smoke up the Kushy, & I don’t like a rookie
I’m calling all the shots and cats are just calling you
So I'm dreaming of several stacks
Hold up in the front when the days go back
Mom in the slum when the bank on that, go tit tit tit for tat
Acting for the roll of the part
And I’m just opposed to the narcs
So mines in the wood, yours in the park
Mines in the light, yours in the dark
Wait till my mind got older, sober from this liquor drinking heavy
I lived the college life we partied, busting, smoking plenty
So when the bowl is empty notify the reefer man
I smoked the green so when we lift we call it Peter Pan
So stop the lying, slime, I just have my mind aligned
You just chasing stupid broads and I’m just chasing dollar signs

Liquid washed down my throat like soap, yeah
I don’t wanna think about the shit that’s warped
But I don’t wanna be deep on this beat
And I can’t fucking let go of whats around me

Everyday gets worse in this fucking universe
Just tryna paint the perfect picture before my child's birth
The show starts, I’m the man behind the curtain
The truth shall reveal itself if one thing is for certain
I’m known to beat the pussy till it’s squirtin'
They suck me off, I got a team of brain surgeons
Already know the blunt is rolled, the charm easer
Put it on God, no facade, I beyond freak-ha
I’m sinking in her ocean like an anchor
She’s shallow, so into myself I try to fuck my own shadow
I know that’s vain, liquor and weed, that ease the pain
So obsessed with Mary Jane no cells left up in my brain
Married to the game, 'bout to jump over the broom
Purple Haze and these shrooms now we sexin' on the moon
We don’t do the planes, nah we on spaceships
Her sex electric pussy tighter than a face lift
Look down, see nothing but grey skies
Living the high life, that is why they hate I
Remember days we use to kiss like the French do
Think about your pussy while I rape these instrumentals

Liquid washed down my throat like soap, yeah
I don’t wanna think about the shit that’s warped
But I don’t wanna be deep on this beat
And I can’t fucking let go of whats around me

First things first, I’m coming for ya neck, kid
Second off, super high, no question
3 L's rolled, kush be my best friend
Plenty women on they knees call me Jesus
Dope man flow, four O’s just to smoke
It’s just me, no gimmicks, real pimping
Straight shittin', what you see is what you getting
I’m 'bout to, I’m 'bout to play with ya kitty kitten
I admire her, so many ways
Whether it’s the breakdown or the cutting flower stage
Whether it’s to bagin, I made G’s off this haze
4 gram blunts keep you high up into space
Lace it with the 
PCP
 then passed it with a straight face
Someone pass the juice and gin, hoes getting loose in here
Shawty with the stupid chin, head game stupid in
Now do my whole crew in here, that’s how we do it here
I'mma find another you, that’s word to who
Never stress her, nah, I just undress her, uh
First base, light the blunt while I’m getting brain
Second base, peel off, now I’m switching lanes
Word from the wise, Juicy beat the pussy right
Word from the wise, Juicy beat the pussy right

Left side is my right side
If its vice versa I’m still the same side
If my left side is my right side
If its vice versa I’m still the same side
Stay until it gets better
I never trust a letter
When it don’t write, don’t matter
I just got a knew one",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-caps-lock-lyrics
Get Yours,Day of the Dead EP,2014.0,"I know sometimes, life is hard
And you wanna give up, but did your mama give up
When she was giving birth to your ass?
I know the Bible tells us that's the reason we all cursed
Ladies know your worth, for you are Mother Earth
The universe is inside of you
And you birth kings, queens, pharoahs and empresses
The kundalini balance in your spine you are divine
Look inside and realize you are a goddess
Cause there's no us without you, mothers
 
Don't we know, don't we know, don't we know

I was born this way, this has been more than a scheme
Oh Lord, I done put my work in, word to my nigga Akeem
Mama can see this, she seen , mama can live by all means
But she's been blinded by society's standards of low self-esteem
That's no metaphor or no simile
Tell you that my moms can't really see
Knowin' diabetes was the enemy
Still I eat grease, palms all greedy
Dog, what I shout you out on the CD
Aw, Never been a contact, I've been involved
Mama don't cry no more
Word to life I seen a nigga die on tour
I done seen some losses, and I see some things
No matter big or small, rich or poor, oh, this is war

I know you wanna be the shit, I just want my mama to see this shit
But (Oh Lord), oh Lord, (Get Yours) gonna get mine, (Get Yours)

Box life, question marks over my head
Waitin' for my princess every night there's nothin' there
Raggedy like Ann
 or, any often am I an orphan?
Are we, important? Is the, world important as the faith we choose?
Is what I consider being the truth to you?
Look left, look right, dreamed it every night
My mama gone, no, no mama home
As cold as it gets, got to move on
She gave her life for what is me
And for that I am thankful as can be
A hero, destiny, I'll be on my way soon
And together we can bloom, run off to the moon
It's not what you thinkin', I ain't have my moms for spankings
So anxious, impatient, taught myself how to face it
To the brothers, and the sisters, no wishlist, no Christmas
Just a witness, of a vicious, abusiveness system
This is the proof in music, hold your head you can do it
This is the proof in music, hold you head you can do it, do it

I know you wanna see this shit but oh Lord (Get Yours)
This is for the mamas, who pregnant at sixteen
Livin off of welfare, never make the big screen
This is for the mamas, live in public houses
Livin' off of foodstamps, and I hope them shoes fit
Always on that new shit, mama made me do it
Talk a lot of shit so, this is a solution

But you're twistin' up the fingers in the flicks
Know you gotta have the good aim

Roll blunts, kickin' back where the crows hunt

Head up in the clouds, never seen my nose run

It's just really really my god, air freshener in your car
We hot boxin' in yo whip, that means I'm just really gone
Highly medicated off this sticky brown in it
Cup full of Henny, Box full of wheaties
Switch you out them church clothes, then you make a mess of me
Freak you on a Sunday, god knows that you're blessin' me
Back twisted, act different I just have visions
Me and mac, bad bitches playin' badminton
Little jack grippin', past livin' large
At home with a big garage
Zombies is killin' shit, send them my best regards
Pussy, Money, Weed, that's all a nigga need, right
My philosophy, never be a decoy
I'm feelin' good homie, Helen Keller shit
Heaven knows my name is smokin' for the hell of it

All the fresh cuts, and you're slick too
Keep a girl feelin' stuck like a ?
Be the first love, say what I want
But I'm sure ?
If you like that, you're gonna love this
This homegrown real strong it's that Kaya piff
I can't smoke it though
Yeah, you're high, so high (smoke it up, light it, light it)
Yeah, you're high, so high (smoke it up, light it, light it)

I just see the smirk, grab the bottle then I pour up
You know what, nah you don't know what
Only drugs in my system, barely losing focus
Smokin' on that loud shit, eyes Barry Manilow
Say you feelin' love sick, well baby here's the antidote
Pull her hair, grab her throat, do that shit with passion though
Fuck with the cameras on, in dramatic fashion yo
Smoke me what my blunt say, fuck me what her cunt say
Nigga I don't want the daily news unless I'm front page
I spit fire, I'm a molotov monster
Versace shades, coogie on, lookin' like papa
It's a party bust that pussy open like pinata
Go deep tug sheets skeet then it's bye bye
Lookin' like an angel, might I sin
Lick lick lick you to your halo
Tongue power, scattered showers
Now you need a raincoat
And it's fuck them all, cause I could never die faithful
Pussy stay tight, ass jello though
Pussy stay high, that's my hello ho
Some nigga like em shy, but I prefer the bold
Is it still a one night stand if she's on all fours?
Let's go half on a baby, pot of pink and a bit of blue
It's war in these sheets I'm bustin' and she bustin' too
If I was in the right mind I would die, come back and wife you twice
Fuck her right mind bitch, the world is mine the life is strife
Dream the americana devil's pie the final slice

Don't fight it, light it
Don't fight it just, light it light it light

So gritty it's trilly

Give Obama the finger
Slide the clip through my nina
Man fuck ya'll niggas
I don't want your feature
Fettuccine with Jeanie

No need to be greedy
Got weed by the tree, b
It's leafy

Smoking GDP, mixed with some Chocolope
Hash in the bowl, that super-duper stinky flow
Juicy be the name, gettin' brain, that's a zombie fault
Flatbush nigga, walking dead, that's a killer flow
Smith & Wesson, catching wreck in your confession
Want the safe, and the stash, and the ma'fucking weapons
Too much Hen, now Juice is going in
Off tops, fuck cops, we hot, you not, that's why they honoring
I've only been around for a second, but I'm killing it
No rest for the wicked, niggas stay lifted, high-class livin'
Put the biscuit straight to your bitch lips
She gone kiss it, I am pimping
My .44's my bulldog - my dog shoots niggas' ears off
My full mask and my AK - tear a nigga out his Chevrolet
My terrier's my .22, just for the litle-ass bitch in you
Two shots for my niggas on the block
Said he feelin' myself, and I ain't gotta see 'em hot
Outlaw, bumping 2Pac, outlaw, bumping 2Pac

I am the one to follow, I am the role model
All my tips is hollow, all my clips extended
All my whips is polished, all my teeth is gold
All my bitches models
All in all I'm all for the onslaught of all of y'all
So all aboard everyone
Awful that I must perform a Holocaust
And offer off the souls of those to get a simple point across
A cross cannot deport ya from the torture or this scorcher
You will not refuse this offer
Sign the dotted line with blood, you will not refuse this offer
Sign the dotted line with blood, you will not refuse this offer",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-inf-beams-lyrics
"Red Light, Green Light",Day of the Dead EP,2014.0,"I lift my hands up high for another night
Cause I've lost my wings and I wanna fly
I even wash my face in the river Nile
I'mma pray all day 'til I get it right

Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers
Pray to God I'm happy every single day I swear
More money, I'm more prepared, more niggas that's unaware
Most niggas don't even listen, they only see what they hear
Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers
Pray to God I'm happy every single day I swear
More money, I'm more prepared, more niggas that's unaware
Most niggas don't even listen, they only see what they hear

My mind ain't certain
That I put enough work in
These beats, these streets, no purpose
Repeat, rebuild, resurface
No longer in disturbance
Get a shooter if you're nervous
Stressed out, made a nigga feel worthless
Can't nobody fuck up on purpose
I remember when I had no government
My name was so crazy, had lines like cocaine
And those the good days, I got them good grades
Had profit to get paid, I made some mistakes
That's something we all gon' say
Had to ignore a bitch call today
But a little bit of head made it all okay
If you niggas want a war, then my boys gon' play

Before I leave the crib you better say your prayers
Niggas trigger happy every single day, I swear
More murder, I'm more aware, more bullets, I'm more prepared
Most niggas don't even listen that's until they hear the bang
Before I leave the crib you better say your prayers
Niggas trigger happy every single day, I swear
More murder, I'm more aware, more bullets, I'm more prepared
Most niggas don't even listen that's until they hear the bang

My mind's uncertain, do I put enough work in?
Redrum, redrum, bloody murder
Headshot, close range, close curtains
No encore, that's for certain
Clack clack, bravo, I murked 'em
Hoes, clothes, more drugs, more murder
More guns, more drugs, more murder, more murder
In the ghetto where the rats eat roaches
Gats tucked in our drawers, we don't need holsters
You gon' learn today, you gon' get involved
With scamming, drug dealing, prostitution and all
In the ghetto praise to God alike a long distance call
I done rang Jesus for years, fuck it, no response
What, I'm supposed to sit and starve?
Ha! Gat in my palm and taking yours be my job
I don't want to shoot and steal
I don't want to kill and rob
I just want to provide
For my mama, my papa, my kids and I
I just want to provide
For my bitch, and my homies that's from my side
But I came straight from homicide

Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers
Pray to God I'm happy every single day I swear
More money, I'm more prepared, more niggas that's unaware
Most niggas don't even listen, they only see what they hear
Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers

Best American,Vacation in Hell,2018.0,"Hey, I'm just doing everything that I can (I can)
Never been jealous of the white man
Black skin, I'm not better, I'm just different
He ain't never sold drugs, this is all a false image, hey

Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under siege boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige nigga, that's how we do
And you know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth

Pay a load of tax, take it out your check, boy, I know you know this debt
'Til you hesitate and right before you purchase that
New chain, new fame, original black
We are well-anointed with the knowledge of the slaves
Land of the free, yeah, home of the brave
Hard to close my eyes at night, I'm dreamin' of the day
Dark terrors in the ferry, turn the world grey
Somehow we gotta pray, it ain't 'bout religious praise
This is real shit, nigga this is not a phase
Born afflicted, misinformed children on the way
Eyes teary, blind fury, cryin' to be saved
Find another way, while escapin', a rude awakenin'
While we caged in, abomination
Clean water for the cavemen
, salutations
Signin' off with a Molotov
Throwing salt while we marchin' off for the common cause

Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige boy, that's how we do

Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige nigga, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye to hide the truth

This a new world, artificial, second brain in my pocket
Tell me how that live through, y'all don't hear me
Unless I talk about my skin tone, and what comes with it
If you live it then you stand strong, that's how we do it
Ain't no father figure, live and learn
Gotta get the money, little nigga making earns
Another day, another cop killed an honest man
Black skin, young-aged, probably had a kid, it never ends
They say government control the weather
How we bustin' all these guns but we can't get together?
Start a unit for all this and make that bread together
Are they crooks? Are they pedophiles or politicians?
Plottin' FDA poisonin' our children now, that's how we living
Throwing niggas in prison, unlivable conditions
Repeat offender, brown, broke, that's the agenda
Never surrender, keep your eyes wide shut, nigga

Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige nigga, that's how we do
And you know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth

Say ""God bless America""
To the red, white, blue noose on my neck, wylin' for respect
Guess freedom ain't free, huh?
Really wanna see a difference, kill some politicians
Red men get executed and forgotten
Black men spent 200 years pickin' cotton
Now they poison our minds and put shackles on our conscious
But they will never get mine, never get mine, dawg I promise
Black 
American Psycho
, ya like Tae-Bo, ya might just get
American Dream be doubling the money with no minusin'
Hate is a disease with no paradise they can’t find that shit
Honestly this shit here’s wave make climate shatter thermometers
Promise my mama, I see mañana, no matter what it is
Coppers be killin' niggas for nada, that shit gotta end
You probably think slavery's abolished, homie they got your brain
Never forget what they did to the man with the moccasin

Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth

""We are all the problem, when we don't make sure
Our dollars stay in our communities for more than six hours
We are all the problem when we don't make sure
That our children are safe going to the public school to prison pipeline
We are all the problem
When we don't homeschool, our children, after school
We are all the problem when we lay down
And expect somebody else to do the work for us
We are all the problem when we don't stand up to oppression
We are all the problem if we go back into slavery
That makes us all the problem.""",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-best-american-lyrics

Aries,Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet Soundtrack,2016.0,"I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

It's like we stuck in a prison
Suffering from lack of wisdom
Suffering from lack of substance
The systems lacking some ism
Since it's killing the misery
Hope my children remember me
Since I sing songs of symphony
Somethings just gotten into me
Message, don't kill the messenger
Message travel through seven seas
Ghetto passion is classic, been getting lashes for centuries
Aided, but mostly separated by color deficiency
Free to you, free the shackles, my mental strain from my ancestry

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

Emancipation, castration, mass-hating, white washing
Black shaving patience, that I'm demonstrating, ugh
Segregation, separation, take my people, chain my people, ship them out, build a nation
Picket lines, demonstration
Kill switch, detonation, this takes dedication
Guess the NBA our reparation
Governmental medication the reverse of levitation
They put fluoride in our water
Guess they trying to kill our babies
Hearts racing, cops and robbers car chasing

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

Whatever your purpose is
Hone in and hold your kids
All of this is distractions and nobody notices
Fiending for knowledge we still in chains
Power tripping for digits we growing it every day
Fighting for free computers in service for student aid
Can't afford to be sick pay more them pills to get paid
Taught to follow the system that institution be prison
These coppers turn me to zombie
I'm walking dead while I'm living

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

Break the chain, break the chain
Why the violence is killing our kids and our brother man
Break the chain, break the chain
How police war with no recourse and you on your way
Break the chain, break the chain
Still identify with those who's have nothing still live in fear
Break the chain, break the chain
Been distracted by the glamor but don't question why we even here
Break the chain, break the chain
Why the violence is killing our kids and our brother man
Break the chain, break the chain

Like Wyclef Jean without the sex scandal
Dismantle and handle any rap dude from New York to L.A
Ya' MC'll get ate, greedy little nigga' never share off the plates
Racks on a bitch, naw, wraps on my dick, pause
Back smack a bitch rapper, blowing loud, been dapper
Blasted, buggin' off Bacardi and acid
Represent my city, these other nigga's shitty
Maino told me nigga's gotta' stick together
Nigga's throwin' over broads like 50 or Mayweather
While half the industry hates on me
I independently, made half a mili' in a year
Still I'm ahead of my prime
And if sleep's the cousin of death ya' falling in line
Zombie!

Fuck the bloggers brah
Most your posts are straight Bolognia
Check any continent they won't find spitters as hot as us
My consciousness, mindfuck, and make her pineal hymen bust
Vomit lava, brah, I'll melt any thermometer
Poison on the television
Baby let me crack handle white
Jesus answers to the prayers of a black man
My third eye see through your insides like a CAT Scan
Got 'dat cha-cha-cha-cha-chopper out & it will not jam
Death around the corner, I hear'em callin'
Paranoia from smoking this marijuana
We all liars, so I guess we all lawyers
If you ain't loyal then you should be in the soil
Hash oil, soarin', saucer
See most of my shows out in Norway, awesome
New day different hoes, same shit, different toilet
Punchlines better than that smack you been snortin'
Past life, writing my rhymes down in papyrus
Acid flashbacks dropping micro-grams in my eyelids
Psilocybin my stylist, look in the mirror for guidance
I am who they really trying to clone with they rhymin'
But their scenes ain't as mean, painting scenes, Meech (Stalley)?
Acid drops from the melting cup ???
Nigga's been known for years and I'm still fuckin' hungry
That ain't the beat bangin' that's the rumble in my tummy
The fronto leaf baggies perspire
And a nigga still sittin' on wicker then the weed don't expire
Says he needs some new bullets, my car gon' need some new tires
Your baby boy needs new pampers, but baby I ain't the father
Bitch!

Grown men be acting childish
When will we stop the violence?
Broke the bitch and fixed it like them presidential ballots
Obscure, not mature, not performed, just the norm
A little bit of everything, a little bit of Mary Jane
Listening to Mary sing ""Spring Memories""
Bumping through my tweet and see my divas in their denim jeans
Crack rock is in my melody, infecting everything you see
All dreams oh yes indeed I got the potency of peace
Investing in my destiny, not like we can all be free
Until my expiration I give all of me, like I ought to be
I order me a number three at the Chinese spot, I rhyme a lot
These figments in my head, will never find my heart
??? baby boy, Sigmund Freud, since the story goes
On the Maury Shows, I rap it all 'till close
Slap, fracture, slaughter hoes
Kill a boy, still avoid, similar to rivers boy, I'm still annoyed
Towering - sound speak louder than I click clack
Empty weapons pull ya' melon back
I roll with hella cats who know the traps
So who you tellin' black? Take a shot and cough and throw it back
Shit, my shawty is a lie like the Zodiac
I'm smokin' weed for all the time I never noticed that
I sparked the chalice on my stoop like I can't hold it back
If you came to be a reasonable opponent
For you zone with, I hold the microphone like it's golden
Motherfucker!

Same nightmare, sleeping in my beach chair
I ain't got a chip on my shoulder but I don't fucking care
Been there, done that, bitches always comeback
Just like my cocaine dealing on the comeback
If I could keep everybody happy I would do that
But it would be one driver, nigga screw that
I still get the ""who that?"", I'm still getting lied to
Forgetful mother fuckers like ""I never supplied you""
Minus the bullshit, must I divide you
Should have realised you, I sat right beside you
Pain is temporary mind you
You mind if I remind you every second because I don't mind to
Where should I sign at? Kid from the corner
No diploma, no graduation cap up in the air
My thoughts get recorded, some niggas come home, my niggas get deported
Tan Boyz did this, shit it's in my blood
I'm pulling for a war, I'm ready you can tell, right on tongue
Back pocket Tan bandanna
All my papis Gucci, brave like Atlanta
Faring for a come up, shit I'm too short for that
California dreaming in my LA Dodger hat
We all gotta win, nobody doubted that
Jumping out of Benzes to jump in the dollar cab
Don't ask why nigga, that's how I keep it
I break hearts now you hate me to pieces
This drug shit I speak it , this fake shit I peep it
You reap what you sew, make sure you look decent
I'm from the rotten manzana, it ain't peaches and cream in my pocket
'Cos everyday I need it
Student of the game before, now I teach it
Never sucked dick, I leave it to the leeches
Or leave it to the bitches
Old told me go in, Cart and Gina believed
Rube say we golden
Had a cold shoulder, now my attitude is frozen
Throwin' powder in the air the streets said I'm chosen

But you know what they say, the beast lives in the East
Bubbling deep in the belly of the city that never sleeps
It's the city where the skinny niggas ride if it's beef
Life of a homicide and collide with police

Got my optics on the money, I will not close my eyelids
Acid reaction fashion, psilocybin my stylist
I done seen shit you silly niggas can't fathom
Golden cap mushrooms, now I'm only seeing atoms
It's insanity over sanity, one love over vanity
Zombie gang walking casualty, bitch nigga, I already died for my faculty
Got infinite bullets for you fucking mere mortals
I'm dumping shots at the sky asking God to open his portal
Ha ha ha ha ha, check out this bizarre flow that I be dishing off
I am so in tune with myself, I can shave my fucking balls
With a razor blade in the dark and not leave a fucking mark
See, I can spit that fly shit, that auto-pilot high shit
That peace, one love, U-N-I-T-Y shit
That P-I-M-P group of bitches on my side shit

Like who music compares? The Zombies kickin' the snares
They say it's a dub, you sold the troub', nigga, what's good?
I'm never intimidated, 
the Sonics like Gary Paton
, the glove
You my blood, Flatbush raised me and such
And bill money, gettin' niggas, they ain't makin' enough
Even though I wasn't rich, I never made it a crutch
I'd rather die a broke man than be rich and pompous
Sloppy with your focus, we hang rosaries for your lack of trust
Start ball, shot's too good for you to pass it up
Informers, they zoom in, scope the situation
I just plug my iPhone in, forget the litigations

I don't believe in non-believers
I don't hear or speak evil either, this the institution of the leaders
Conspire retribution for our freedom
We squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people
I don't believe in non-believers
I don't hear or speak evil neither, this the institution of the leaders
Conspire retribution for our freedom
We squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people

When it's permanent, they show their nervousness, dog
This when you serve your sermon with salt, petty, dog
I told you already how I got my mind made up
Switchin' foreigns like customs, so when I drive the lay up
Picture me fallin' victim, man, I gotta stay up
No trickery with my Benjamins, you gotta pay up, say what?
My identity, lost in the matrix with this trinity
Architect on the set, we was on the TV screen
Got the check, got the rep, then I changed the scenery
Spent some days in Paris just to peril in my queen and me
Butterfly charms, that's a honor what they mean to me
I just wanna see the same things that my idols see
Wait to see the god in me, I done told the 
Odyssey
40 for the thing that be playin' when I'm rhymin', B
I done post things, I fly planes all account of me
Just another day, gettin' paid when you count on me

I don't believe in non-believers
I don't hear or speak evil either, this the institution of the leaders
Conspire retribution for our freedom
We squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people
I don't believe in non-believers
I don't hear or speak evil neither, this the institution of the leaders
Conspire retribution for our freedom
We squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people
I don't believe in non-believers
I don't hear or speak evil either, this the institution of the leaders
Conspire retribution for our freedom
We squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people
I don't believe in non-believers
I don't hear or speak evil neither, this the institution of the leaders
Conspire retribution for our freedom
We squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-proxies-lyrics

Who will defend them?

Misunderstood,Vacation in Hell,2018.0,"Selfish dream, self-esteem, self-destruction off the beams
Helpless beings sowing seeds to assert the solar fiends
Though it seems shit ain't panning out but it's on the screen
Know that means we are being deemed as a comedy

This is me, fuck you mean, living like I'm in a dream
Visualize it unity, divide it far as you can see
Diamonds bling while they bleed, fighting for our future seeds
Figure where you wanna be, choose a side and take the streets

I said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above, don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away
Truly I do mean well, it may not seem that way
I said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say
Missing some screws above, don't feel okay today
I pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away

Is Archimedes mucho and greedy? It's what I'm pleadin', yes
Mischievous the true elite convenient, placing books where your TV is
Alleged genius proceed to flee with hits
I'm leaving this, a form of preemie fetus kid, I'm devious

Processed by the media, this ain't no Wikipedia
Foods lacking substance and people change for the greedier
Selfish and feeble weak minds blinded by ego and pride
Hope we can see with three eyes because we need to see why

Half - Time,Day of the Dead EP,2015.0,"These some intimate thoughts
In a Porsche, sipping Cris' through a straw
You on the board, trying to get through a shore
I was bored, trying to get me a broad, not a bitch or a whore
You talking rank, tryna' settle the score
Diamond to dog, living like the kind in the air
Peace to my earth, I swear that she the mom of the year
Peace on my turf, ducking all the models in here
Beating the dirt, success is like kilometers near
Stuck at my worst, karma talking dead in my ears
I'm writing this verse, same time I met with my fears
Quarter-century but way way ahead of my years
I been gone since Daquan seen him dead at the stairs
Stay strapped though, never lack though, watch your back though
Word to Fat Joe, we let them ninety-nine clap mo'
This the city called the rotten apple
Now you know if you didn't know, nigga better pop a Snapple

Sitting in a room like why the room is spinning like the bitch in Exorcist head is?
My mind is always on lettuce
Paper chase, shrooms laced, heard the road is infinite
No chain, no pendant
No Range, no Bentley
My rhymes be shitting on lives of rappers you into
It ain't ironic I use a number-two pencil
Better pay homage if ever we bump into
Shotty pump hit you, mama grab the tissue
Extra magazine, licking niggas wasn't a issue
Saint Laurent leather, I'm like Fonz with a pistol
In broad day, I'll address any issue
And undress any damsel in distress, if she into dead niggas
And I ain't talking about the presidents or the evil residents
Never see the Benz again
All four quarters, it's onslaught, pure slaughter
All aboard bitch cause' it's all water

The Messiah and the Maestro
Pen prolific and now I'm twisted off nice 'dro
Thoughts gifted, I'm non-existent tonight, ho
I hit her once, slide shawty like the iPhone
So I shine regal for the people in Paraná
One kiss for my girl, two kiss for my mama
Parted from my pain, won't dissipate
This is missions on minimum wage
Until I'm dug up out the grave, reincarnated
Po' her ass on the glass, off the Bombay
I get around 2Pac, just like the song say
Flow frame of thought , fuck your loss this is Fonzie
The Columbine of the Comic-Con
I'm blowing up for the common kind
I told you pigs I ate finer-swine, I got my own shit
Why you riding mine, huh? And we close at Ramadan
And you not a soldier, need a shoulder you can cry upon

Run from the Ops, duck shots and maintain
Timbs butterscotch, Balmain at ballgames
I ain't ever flopped, my name hall of fame
Drunk driving, swerve lanes, tonight we get (High)
Learn from the block, we plot to get payed

Real Late Hot 97 Freestyle,Underground Airplay 2: The New York Renaissance ,2013,"Bad bitches and Hennessy
Bad bitches and hella weed
Top flight
Smoking all night
Thinking to myself what a motherfucking life
Drugs, hugs, daps, love, slugs, murder, blood-clots
Morbid, homicidal gore shit
Feeling kinda nauseous
Leave you dripping like a faucet or
Bloody abortion Abu Ghraib
Hood on the face
Spray at your waist
What a waste
Shitty, feces, like my fuckin ?
Yeah my bitch bad stretch that coochi like a slinky
Coogi or the fur, serve rims like d'oeuvres
Finger itchin
Steady trippin in the kitchen
Psychedelic mushrooms
I'm on another mission
Miss me with that bitchin'
No pot to piss in
And they say we ain't hip-hop
Raised by Big Pop and 2Pac
Get your shit rocked
Smoke you like my pipe do
Ignite the flame (Lighter Sound)

If greatness was a woman this would be the song I'd give her
Ever since a seed I promoted myself
Me and my niggas
The difference between anonymous and the violence we bring
Only deter the minor acknowledge us all as kings
I fight with my own discretion
Only if he pull that weapon
I fought for my own perception
Godly in all forms
You see me, you see me wrong
You see Cesar Millan my dog
My nigga, the realest, the raw
The river the pain deliver the rain for you
Tat on my arm
Not in the literal sense but nigga my word is bond
Choice is to be that man once his steak is on the plate
Deliver it all ?
Uh
Underdog from the terror of God
Pick apart the elements and put together my song
My heart is heavy kid I never thought id ever belong
But I was wrong, Architect is everything that you on

Money can't buy happiness? Dummy it is happiness
Trap house, got work in them kitchen cabinets
Weed in them tablets, codeine and aspirin
Basking in the ambiance while I'm on the Ambien
Klonopins, gold mouth Meechy, million dollar grin
Mescaline, psychedelic, felon with the sentencing
For beating up the beat, and his tongue be his weaponry
Good brain'll blow a nigga's brain, J.F. Kennedy
Mind frame on the damn back seat of his Bentley
I'm hard to tame, that's why I'm in leopard print everything
You ain't 'bout that life, so it's best you never try, dog
I ain't scared of death, that's cause I already died, dog
Blood still wet, cut the check and count them pies, dog
Freaky bitch with me, man - she'll probably lick my eyeballs
Man she'll probably lick my eyeballs, man she'll probably lick my eyeballs

I’m real silly with it, real witty with it
Grab the titty watch it wiky wiky
Got my spliffy, I been a Benz punamy
Your pussy ?, it’s on to the next
Live from the underground, peep the sound
Wild motherfucker, golden smile
Tryna stay level headed, hold shit down
Walk around, no crown, champion bound
Flatbush raised me, the drug game paid me
Yo bitch I’m blazin and smoking in the same speak
Buss up in her mouth piece, nigga there, no seeds
Beast Coast, we been here, permanent ink flow
Got the choppers, pop yo partners, fill em up like empanadas
Young man, any given day could be yo last
Elevate yo mind, intertwine visions from the sky
Zombies never die, we multiply

Told you, multiply
Told her don’t be shy, multiply light the chronic
Shawty left my fingers sticky like the onyx
I am automatic, trigger happy, I am nigga
Nappy, nigga savvy so you rappers don’t harass me
I would rather you just pass me by
Pharcyde, that-a-way, fuck what niggas gotta say?
I know I kept you waitin, articulatin my gamma ray
Brain storm, 8 arms, lead this generation
New school, I’m elevate on, help with nathon nigga
Fall like dominoes and somehow the best to kill
The truth nobody knows
Common as the abyss, is it truth is it myth?
You got a fetish for humor? I fuck around with yo bitch
Telekinetic powers if the world was ours
I would seek the honest, I am off the island
All I see is money multiplying like a motherfucker
You’re a blood sucker, we known to hustle
Love to bust so uh
Why yo broad’s touchin the plain clothes don’t bother me no more
Got em all in the law, have you chit checking yo jaw
Nigga raw, I told you before we set it off
So of course is this confrontation then I'mma shrug it off

Uh, well I guess it’s my go
Aye, well I guess it’s our go
Every bar raise the bar, I perform holocaust
All aboard man, my cup done runnin forth
As I pour I make sure I give ya'll that rugged roar
I mention them drugs and whores, they’d crucify me for sure
But a cross on my back will not detour me
From the road to the riches and the diamonds
For surely, young black gaudy
Due to nature we naughty, the mysterious, far from imperial
Perfection be the minimal, grab my crotch and commit my moonwalk in the holy pyramids
LSD got my spider senses tinglin
Bomb ass weed got me higher than Corey light crashin in some buildings
Eyes low like Clint East when you’re filmin him
Coke and some rum, now she feelin me
Coke and she numb but she feelin it, big chief Meech
Smoking like a chimney, tab on my tongue deflecting negative energy
I think I figured out why they killed Pac, Big, and Kennedy
But I keep that on the down low like half of the industry
3 foreign chicks in my bed and they tend to me
Under the sheets it’s more legs than the centipede
And my penis the centerpiece
Fuck You mean bitch I been the beast
Beast, what’s beast?
One finger can sweep the streets
And this beast live in the east and you feast, opposite don’t leak
My flow is very unique, my hair is crazy as me
FU, NYC, we hold it down for you
That ain't rhyme, Zombie
But I’m a rhymer, Zombie
That ain’t rhyme but I’m a rhymer

Fresh out the grave, bloody money, money great
Bong rips, 4 AM, feelin born again
Look at him, I look at I, as I drop 3 times
Two more drops on each eye, feellin like I can fly
No R Kells but I don’t mind, she’s 17, she get the pipe
I’m Marshall Mathers, I’m Randy Savage and I beat the coochi, call it gymnastics
My song tragic, my flow hazard
Them girls love the cocky like they love the molly

Attitude, fuck it, like I'm caught with my pants down (What?)
You pussy, and I always been the dawg
Most of the game are rookies, you know that we came to ball
Sooner you bring it to me, the sooner we ship it off
Hennessy and bad decisions, makin' millions off a song
With this bad lotto, my motto, drive and swerve potholes
Numbers don't lie when on my side, capo (Hahaha)

See I learned a new word today, nigga
Triskaidekaphobia
An extreme superstition regarding the number thirteen
That's why a nigga don't be havin' thirteenth floor on the—anyway
Most project buildings don't really get past thirteenth floor anyway, so it don't really matter
What's poppin', blood? You good, you good?

But since I'm an ill nigga, I'm not phased, boy, it's a shield
How you feel? Had to get my dough up, so what?
Now I'm back in it like I sobered up, rolling up
They all witness to the wise men, husband and they wives and
Had some salt with niggas, tried to one-up like a Heisman

Never gave you permission, so why you feel obliged then?

The more I save, the more I stay the same without a doubt
Know it's different, I'm a legend, these are credits, not just clout
I just hope I see the day when niggas ain't shootin' it out

Devil is still aline, I ain't going where y'all headed
I don't get what I want, I know my niggas is war ready

Withdrawal from the fiends, they say ""you can't deprive me""

Come here and find me

Then play Russian roulette with three techs
And laugh as I cheat death
I ain't really see defeat yet
I roll that sour dies with ease yes
Then close my eyes, flip that lighter and take a deep breath
A bad bitch in the vacant room
A eighth of shrooms, picture me jumping the broom
Cameras zoom on the poon, I'm just trying to gape(?) a womb
Got bitches by the dozen, think I need a whole platoon

Four circles, flat blunt to that Maui Wowie
I give her dick so good, she scream ""I don't deserve you""
Then she squirt-squirt on a nigga like some perfume
Her body is a temple, I guess it's safe to pray
Before I eat the pussy, make sure to say the grace
But she don't know that, I'm really really a cold nigga (frigid)
And all I got is golden showers for these gold diggers

Hold up--Zombie
So why you frontin'?
Told you I'm a zombie
Come here and find me

The blunt bachelor, packed with hella green
In the fronto(?), they call me tonto with my regime
Negrodamus
, 
graduated honors to that high grade
80s baby, but we don't wanna see your high fade
Fill your tank, road trip, zombies moving rank to rank
Brooklyn shit, just respect it(?) bitch and blow this danky dank
I thought you heard, don't deserve to bring your girl by us
World's flyest, now I'm watching all your girls try us
So my story blood, it's (?) came to life
It wasn't new pussy, somehow I made it right
Four Gs of OG, her-on how my fro be
Arc is the codeine(co-de?), bizarre how my flow be (I feel good)
Play my vinyl, move bitch, lie down
Room full of goons cause the parties never die down
Listening to Shaka, open up your chakra
I lick her proper homie, spiritual docta",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-suspiria-lyrics
Mood Swings,UnKnown,2013.0,"Yeah I'm so focused man
Smoking cali with my niggas bout 14 grams
Red hoopty swerving, matching the red of my eye
Devise a plan, come up on grams, same thing new shit
Tryna dip my balls in shawty drawers she told me that I'm naughty
I smoked it like a shotty, Brooklyn stand behind we
I might be young black, smoother than ice-tea
Toking on that fine pine tree, make my eyes bleed

Feeling it like a viking on vicodin,
 riding on my bicycle high
My kush , I ain't tryin to see them behind me
Don't mind me, I'm just a young American man
With a plan too big to fit in my pockets
Let me stop at the store for a bottle
Pinch a little kush from my partner
That's my nigga I'm sure he won't mind it
Nigga it's the Dest and the Zombies
Who wanna contest and get clobbered
Huh, huh, check the style boy
Good Joon signing out the OverDoz wild boy

The kushin' got my eyes stain glass like mosaic
Know I'll be your favorite but if it's wack I won't play it
I'm sayin
Levitated thoughts, drug into your veins
Sandy out in cali, in New York we hurricane
Overdose of my own coast, in this Worlds Fair
If shawtys come in twos, I guess we can compare
If shawtys count your cash, make sure that this all there
Hit the bong, lighters in the air, for this nigga here

Hold the phone, no control, bitch I might overdose
Zombies, Worlds Fair, motherfucker, watch the chrome reload
Samo tatted on your bitch's titties nigga (Bumbaclot)
Samo graffiti in your fucking city nigga
Passing on the blunt, never passing on the cunt
Straight action Cleopatra while Apache on the hunt
So boom bye bye and naughty boy header
Represent underground New York I'm master Shredder

For the regular, don't think we going toe to toe with you
It's nothing tall with you, but this unity rolling over you
It's over dude, I want the crew to meet your boo thing
Move ring, ring around your eye, that's a mood swing
Felt the Heltah Skeltah
 of the welterweight champ
Watch their face plant, soon as they hear the bass amp
Do what they can, Don drop the bomb, no time for shelter
I've been here, just waiting for that Link like Zelda, Don

Cali sunshine on my face as I wake n bake
High as hell, fly as hell, can't hold me down but a paper weight
Closet filled with Bathing Ape shit looking like an 
Nike Free Runs for the paper chase
Zooming from Queens to Flatbush to LA then I'm overdosing
Not on heroin but  from chiefin' on potent
Don't front, you know I got your open
It's the original smooth Queens nigga track flowing like

Karma is a bitch so I feed her good dick
Jimmy P, take the swish, roll it up and take a hit
I, live in the beat, I really don't exist
I, am like a glitch, eyes low, I spit like
Retarded kids 'cept I'm more genius
Spend it manure, that means shit, holds the door, might exist
Tenth floor rapid fire that means persist
Tenants inhale, hashish, that means that he's bent
Like a tenant, pay your rent, and bent",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-mood-swings-lyrics

MTV RapFix Brooklyn,UnKnown,2013.0,"D.T.A. I don't trust none of my homies
Juice laced my spliff with PCP and never told me
Pass me a cup of bleach and send me straight off on this codeine
Wash it down with O.E
Now im throwed' up like O.G's
My voice hold the beat down, its the anchor
And my homie stay with the metal/medal like Kurt Angle
Zombies blowing up like the Boston Marathon
Boom! What to soon? Opposite of late bloom
Dunk from the free throw since I was spewed from the womb
Survival of the fittest, I ate my twin in the womb
And due to Robin Givens I may never jump the broom
And while you paid for pussy I was out in Paid Dues
Stage diving turn to  diving, people to my pool
You a fool if you think I ain't on the move
I am it, I am new, I exude what cannot be reproduced
Execute for my grimy and my destitute

Thicker than a brick
Then im slicker than Rick
Cryptic, keep a Bic on flick
I remember playing hookie with rap rookies for corner store goodies
Cop a Rita ? pucking liters ? and Adidas and hoodies
Real G's I big up
Ill sounds I stick up
More nouns I pick up the more rounds I hiccup
Ludacrics, move Im movin''with you thinkin'is moving this
Well done, Peter Lugar if the route is lucrative
I need more rapping and less ego
Another 'I'm next' rapper, here we go
I be in ? with the infested pen, effect them
And no I don't invest in trends
My audio get ? stuffed in an auditorium
You just a pupil in my musical emporium
Dimensions, I'm blessed with
The flow quenches and drench all five senses
I crossed the Atlantic on the strengths of my raps
They ain't gotta speak the language here to faithin they claps
You were sleeping on my block, taking them naps
Now the boat is like a yacht and you be looking for daps
But, I'm something like a famous nobody
I did it on my own so I owe nobody
My life for fans wristbands and hand stamps
Talks about revolutionaries in band camp
5'2'' and climbing
And I know that life is timing
Its a culture im refining through this consequential rhyming
Cause I don't want my brothers to work no more
And I don't want my mother to hurt no more
So I be doin' it and doin' it, and doin' it well
Sitting next to Bob Marley, Fella, and John Micheal
Vocabulary acrobatic scraping through the static
Instrumental addict, I'm a hip-hop fanatic

Spit in your face at the Pearly Gates
At twenty-four nigga special like a thirty-eight
The limerick that I kick if four finger ring shots
I use to bust them niggas limbs up like a green spliff
Defying odds
No façade man my city like Oz
So with this tree of weed I'm never tryna be the prize
Rapper dudes half 'em use when I scribe thought
Im a quiet man so if I can't stand I'll fall
Rather be a failure than never mentioned at all
The dimensions of the mind measure crime like yellow tape
Music the bass swap my heart for an 808
You out of shape smoking great
Good God like J.R
Nostrils filled with the potency
I'm smoking keef
Roll my windows down so you notice me
Bow down my radiator hiss like my Amy Wine by now

Spittin' shit
Disfigured like ligaments
Picture the making of this
My hands tied
Watch the smoke float by, by, by, by, by, by
On the porch, newports, packs of the loud
New girl packin the crowd the mac is spectacular
Is you humpin or lovin'
Ehh, a little something
Bitch you know I'm buzzin' bumpin' ? in the back of Matts trunk
And drunk, and we up yet we slumpin'
Zombie, fully function
Fuck corruption, lies vivid as Jannet's titties
Terroristic expirements
America's full of shit
Blinded by skin color
Blinded by his lover
Blinded by shining lights, and you the gift of life
Relax my mind 'til it's do or die
Each moments a mineral
Poetry's protein
The verse is a vitamin
Effects like codeine

Black God, no porcelain
While C.E.O.'s fartin' in their offices
While Latin broads be fuckin' all orifices
And fuck laws
Fuck all officers
And fuck that little money that they offer us
And fuck take it with them cause its all for us
Cosmic thoughts nigga I'm unorthodox
Cut from a different cloth like I'm an altered tux
Ulterior motives in the 'Scarface' Porsche
Guns ? in case they ever play us soft
I'm a rapper but I'm a rapper but I'm not just rhymin'
Fucking right most of my weeds got multiple in common
I just 'Be' be but I don't listen to Common
I don't listen to O.D.B. and I'm nothing like 'em
That don't mean that I don't like 'em
I knew that you would think that
Cause I be rhymin' psychic
And you can to, guess what the next line is...
""Suck my dick!""
Gold teeth like I got ? no gingivitis
If niggas claiming that they gods than we titans
Niggas talk but they hardly enlightened
I done been through it all, shipwrecked with a tiger
And so it is with God ?
Black gloves over both my palms poppin' up like a fucking photobomb
Popping at you like im fucking Proto Man
And that's some old shit you have to be a nerd to understand it
As focused as a Don, hell been over my mission ?
The United States lost the Gulf War
As the world turns and lesbians bump pussies
There ain't to many niggas alive that can fuck with me
As the world turns and these niggas suck dicks
Ain't a moetherfucker breathin' that can touch this",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-mtv-rapfix-brooklyn-lyrics
BetterOffDead Tour Cypher 2,UnKnown,2013.0,"I been here, you been where
Life ain't sweet, no beach chair
Arc dropping samples, gotta clear air
Still hustle everyday, like there's no care
I pray everyday, too much sin
Niggas at the top, soon fallin
Man, I got nothin to lose
Probably be on front page bringing up the old ways
Fuck your major corporations, the government they rapists
Don't matter where you're from, grab your motherfuckin' gun
When they run up in your crib, spray em down like it's fun
And they don't give a fuck if we living in hell
As long as they can make money off of motherfuckin tales
From Kanye to Kimmy, Chris Brown, Rihanna
They wanna see us lose, our relationships are ???
When niggas in the hood, ain't got no fuckin shoes
Nah, we smarter, we gotta change the game
It's our fuckin world, it's time to make the claim
Bang bang

100 keep it, I live, die by my own hands
Somebody bodyin me is not in my program
It's ironic that I called my code Lohan
Spank a young nigga till he turn into a grown man
And I'm not a grown man, got nothing to prove
Buck 50 on pretty face, I got money to lose
I got bitches to choose from
And please no hickeys bitch that's rule 1
My baby mother wild, me and my 10 boys pow-wow
At the round table check your cell phones
40 cals, my Glock never on safety
Nigga never played me, nigga never robbed me
Bullet never grazed me, whassup ho?
I'mma give you what you need
Some hard dick and coke, i'mma put up in yo asshole
It's ironic they want beef with the cash cow
I'm trying to get in this motherfucker and cash out
A couple bottles of brown water
When the sun up, papi pass out
Cold as ice, anty up when we mash out
Homie that's real talk, raised on Baltic Ave
Now I walk the bro walk

Posin for photos, pistol in hand
Collar open like Han Solo, who rolled 6 grams
Don't even pass us ??????
9 in yo chest, 9 in yo spine, Tony Romo
My liquor dark, my bitches light
Pussies a homo
I'm from the ghetto where we recycle our paper plates
And everybody got a relative upstate
Nigga I’m talking jail upstate, not a crib upstate
Hawk tyres tyring rather you duct tape
Or I could fibre wire them, extended clips are my specialty
Especially when aimed at enemies with benefits
Ain't got a license for my whip, or my weaponry
But fuckin niggas still ride out for them presidents
But only for Franklin, Benjamin
Gun butt ya, cut ya, I snuff ya with that snub nose
I'm robbing every local deli for molly
And pronto ?????? pop a molly, I just pop a tab
Open a bag of dat maui wowie, roll it take a drag

Won't ever stop me, zombies on yo ass
Most of these niggas is carbon copies
Harlem get the cash, 
I like my head sloppy, bitch

I got a girl, but I really need a wife at home (4x)
I'm gone",https://genius.com/Flatbush-zombies-betteroffdead-tour-cypher-2-lyrics
