So I be hittin' the 99 to get me a dub for 40 duckets
But ain't no bucket ride that RTA, hop on the 10 to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid

Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-Glock for some dollars
So, get a bag of yayo and a quarter O, oh

And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut so fuck them po-po

Niggas smoke plenty weed but I gotta save, gotta come up

Headed cross town cause niggas, the 1st get celebrated
Rushin' to the block cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the 1st, just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The 1st be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease
I gotta get paid on the 1st, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs
Poetic Hustlaz and the Graveyard Shift, on the 1st

Thug Luv,The Art of War,1997.0,"Nigga, we doin' this shit from Cleveland to L.A., nigga
Whatever you niggas want, we bring it!
Thug Luv, (biatch!) nigga what time is it?
Yo, I don't give a fuck where you lay at, nigga
It's time to slay these bitch-made niggas!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
They ain't even knowing what type of niggas we is
Where my thugs at? Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
I know you niggas been waitin' for this for a long time
Well, here it is, nigga, here it is!
What you gonna do with it?

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon, Lord
You know, that I won't fly by that lesson
You taught me, to pull out my Wesson you brought me
And I'm not stressin' it softly
Get 'em up off me, 'cause all we
Wanted was harmony, been bombing 'em
Yell up out of my ghetto, I won't settle, get on my level
They can't, stop me and pop me
Nigga, they got me? Fuck no
Little Pac gets schizophrenic, let's manage, to damage, all y'all
I'll, talk about 'em, and you don't really want it
'Cause they're cornered, and I'm want 'em, to not jump
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down
So quick to test, bullet, yes, declare war
Roll, I'll flow when I get the gun for the murder
Mo' horror! Why? They did it all, pause for the cause
And I, finna to pull a 9 or pistol, and lit a nigga with mine
Fuck them niggas, it's on
All y'all fall! Bizzy getting bitches to test me
Bless the floor, and any attempt to arrest me, stress me
Lord, looking at death with the last of my breath
Follow, follow, my kids!
But don't sin, in my steps!
Yet the weapon is kept, with the best of my secrets
Deep in the reach, I'm alone, nigga, believe
That I can see it, if needed, and if you really with me
And well then let it be, get the greens and we running up over Cleveland

Ha, ha! What's poppin', nigga? (yeah!)
Put your muthafuckin' hands on your strap, nigga
Thug Luv, nigga. Yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out (Thug luv)
Or do this like punks, and punk it out
Pull your strap on me (Thug luv), nigga, you better kill me!
Thug Life, baby. Thug Luv

I'll probably be punished for hard livin', blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts, in God's prison, hands on the strap
Prayin' so Father please forgive me!
Police be rushin' when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on TV
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic, when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these, bitch niggas ""Bring it on""
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a, cold-ass world; niggas, kill you in your sleep
Watch me, until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got, Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me!

Little thug from the Land, nigga, never ran
Muthafuckas out to get me. They don't understand
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work and do some dirt
Fuckin' around with the band Bone, Thugs-N-Harmony
Follow down the road, we stroll to meet karma
Everything I do, it seem to cause drama
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor, bomb ya!
So quick to test us, nigga wanna crash me, eat dust
For the love of the lust, niggas bustin' on us
Hit 'em up with the buck, 12-gauge erupt!
It's my Art of War, puttin' niggas on the floor
When I'm comin' through the door, bringin' nuthin' but terror
Causing much pain to the nigga that dared us
Tried to put a twist in this thugsta era
Paired up, with a nigga like Pac
And a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug luv 'til I die, keep my prayer to the sky
But I'm still in the hood, smoke and fry
So I beg, the Lord to save us all: escapers of misery
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries, soldiers of the century, yeah

Here to get it, told my niggas they need get, Down
With the dirt, and we don't fuck around
Buck a couple of rounds, and if you're passin' through
Then hit the ground, and don't get caught up in the crossfire, nigga
Artillery thick, and you don't wanna get to fuckin' with this
I'm straight devil, not a punk and pretend
I reload, and buck a little mo'
Flee the scene 'fore the po-po even know
""So, who ya looking for?"" They don't know!
A mothafucka with a leatherface
Hey, man, she said I ran this way, said I ran that a way
Ya hoes'll never know because I got away (yeah)
A criminal mind, to keep a nigga on the level
Sometimes, so get high, and analyze your crime
Correctly organized and with results, you'll be surprised

Oh, nigga, can you feel the vibe? We can ride
Playa hating niggas, you gots to die, it's only right
Fucking with Bone, better leave it alone
Mo Thugs come crack their fuckin' domes
Still in the hood, where the thugs play
Fuckin' with nuthin' but thugs, mane
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses
We crackin' them domes around my way
Give it to 'em on another level, nigga, get a shovel
You can dig a hole; bitches is dead!
Infrared, to your head. You can beg, you can fled
But still gonna bleed bloody red
Fuck with mine, we'll be seen in the moonlight
'Cause we out ridin', lookin' for you (for you)
Better run for cover, nigga, duck!
We about to bust, Straight got the infrared, put it on his forehead
Make some moves, send flowers straight to his home
Put a card in the muthafucka, send it to his mama
Tell her he was dead wrong, dead wrong
Now he long gone, long gone

'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, run with us, run with us!
'Pac, 'Pac run with us, 'Pac and Rip, with thug love",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-thug-luv-lyrics
Thuggish Ruggish Bone,Creepin On Ah Come Up,1994.0,"We're not against rap, we're not against rappers

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

You're feelin' the strength of the rump, step up
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin'
Bring on that ammunition, trip and don't slip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out ""Mo'!"" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about that hanging, clocking my bank
And thuggin' with trues, foo's

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug
Bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this teaching
You soldiers how thugstas must stack
Me drinkin' me brew 'til me skull crack
Wig blew all the way back

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank
Thug never gonna change so flame up
Sit back and just smoke to the same cut
Leatherface on the creep and I came up

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

Gotta give it on up to the Glock-Glock
Pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow!
The Bone in me never no hoe so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me picked em
The blood in me running my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The Thug in me running with thugs so
To the temple, buck when you duck
To the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies

I Tried,Strength & Loyalty,2007.0,"Bone Thugs, Akon, yeah
You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through

I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up

Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine doing my crime
With Toot and Hen, steady stacking my ends
Putting my serve down on the Clair 9-9
Hitting up the Graveyard Shift with Ren
Little Will, Big Wally and Wish Bone
Little Wally High Rollerz and he wonder why niggas so strong
Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod Jay, much love
Kept a nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang when you let ya nuts hang
Gotta make a grand at least daily, man
Them Cleveland hustlers never no busters, thug to the heart
We niggas from the land fool, and the old school
Just serve out ya sentence and be cool
Fucking with Trues, rest in peace
Little nigga RIPsta stress that Bone love
Smoking on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug
Calling up my niggas when it's time to nut up
In the 9-9, niggas gonna drop to the number one
With your gun so run, run
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from
Slanging them dum-dum-dum dums

Niggas it's going down up in the C-Town
Get 'em up with a thug and the nigga with the bud
Got the fifth of Rose
'Fore the liquor store close, hit 'em up with the forty reasons
Nigga, roll up ya Buddha
Smoke it all up, nigga, don't stiff on the reefer
Mo running up outta the club with this
Plus I got hydro and this shit is creeper, peep the
Strip as you hear the double Glock-Glock
Widda me rocks cocked, sweating me bad
Coppers betta drop when the gunshots pop
Glock top hit the body and the bullshit stop
Whenever them troubling us
Where the po-po niggas roll solo, split up and swerve
Krayzie take caution, take out my yayo and tossed it
Send 'em in the road to the curb
Running, ducking
Jumping up in the land, my niggas is crazy
We slang and we buck and we bang on the Glock
And my nigga that’s daily
Who the nigga with the 12-gauge, pump
Mr. Sawed-Off Leatherface so you betta pray
Eternally thugsta, East 1999
That 9 we rep to the death, what!

Gotta give peace to the SCTs
And the one big thug on the Glock
Pump blast to the cash
Then I mash the gas gotta dash away from the cops
Now Li'l Mo Heart steadily sippin' on Rose
Ripping up flesh with six fours
That's that thugsta, yes I pump slugs
And I be dropping 'em off in dumpsters
Fuck them po-po, all a dem bodies we burn, burn
And I guess that hood'll never learn
Gotta dip mo' thin ones in sherm
When I'm on a mission for my city
Pick up my niggas be peeling out with me
Me roll up the window, the wind blow
Fuck up my indo high that’s hitting me
Even if the barrels of me 12 gauge are empty, me scandalous
Niggas up outta the woods bucking, no fucking with the family
Now feel it nigga, understand me
Much love, much bud for them St. Clair Thugs
East 1999 is where you'll find me
Slanging me motherfucking drugs

Dun dun, leaving the niggas to cock it, pop widda me gun
They know that me nodding they head off and I gots to have me fun
Leaving 'em hung, breaking, faking, you studio gangsta bitch, trick
Niggas'll get beat, I'm handling the shit and I split in the midst of the darkness
Consider me heartless, oh yes Flesh be running a ho check
Betta check your Rolex, ya timed now for giving up respect
To them SCTs from C-L-E plus scandalous niggas that dwell
Hell off of the forscythe and bail, leaving a trail of
The bloody victims, the Fifth Dog mauling 'em all
And never them catch me slipping
And sipping the fifth of divine
They may give me time instead a me tripping
We flipping the scripts on over, see the Bone a be never sober
Niggas told you, triggers showed you, East 9-9, five soldiers

Wanna run, red rum, try to run and get away
But it's just too late
Watch out buckshots when I come, buck buck
Betta guard that fucking face
Dumping them slugs on you fools

Weed Song,BTNHRESURRECTION,2000.0,"Take me
Higher, higher, baby
Can you feel it?? (feel it, feel it, feel it)
Do you feel the same weed high that I feel??
Cuz I'm so high (reefer makes you feel that way)
And I feeling so right
Roll (roll), let's smoke, I got to get high
I been high since the last song (off that la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
And I just been smokin' and smokin'
Smoke another blunt, roll another up
You know that weed can really ease your mind
Every time I smoke good reefer that indo high makes me fly
If everyboby smoked a blunt, relieve the mind, the world could
Be a better place
If everybody took a break and we all just got wasted
Toked out (out, out out), smoked out (out, out, out)
Choked out (out, out, out), pull another O (out, out, out)
Let's get P-O-D-ded (P-O-D-ded, P-O-D-ded)

The weed can't get no better (no better baby)

20 dollar hollars, all day, everyday
Come around my way, you gone want to stay
Weed makes me hungry, happy, and all I can say
Sure I need some more
Don't make we wait, stay awake, fake sleep
Got the weed between the sheets
Catch me, Mary J. blessed me
Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt
Open up and what you'll find in there (you don't really want)
I never been in High Times (I never been in High Yimes)
I never been in High Times
But can you tell me that I've been so high all my life
Am I high enough (am I high enough)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)

I remember being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always, stay high
The weed (the weed), makes me feel alright (alright)
If you feel like I feel, I got half on yo dime
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would
Since its yours you could, you should
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt nigga huh, please think of me
Cuz you know I nigga like to get high (high), high and free
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right
Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high
So high

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my my my
I know you wonder why I do it. Love the sky
And I soar up so high
This mornin' I was in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby, but last night I got P-O-Ded instead
So please don't go away, that's all I got to say
Is I gotta have you mary j
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when I'm taking fat ass blunts to the brain
Oh darlin' I'm goin insane, and I really wish we can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in Amsterdam
You heard enough, you heard it all, nothin' but a, a really thug nigga
Nothin' less than a killa, I'm out in front makin' my scrilla
I'm happy to know , the slide is the ball, and kick as strong as me
You rippin' the bong like me, can't hit it as long as me

And when I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and every day I wake
Niggas rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I keep a case of Swisher Sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in my drop top
Glock cocked, rollin', just rollin'
Me and mary jane
Its my world, its my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddah, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up
We can kick it, smoke a fatty to the dome
Nigga lay high, thugged out, smokin', all, night, long

The weed can't get no better (no better baby)
The weed can't get no better (no better baby)
The weed can't get no better (no better baby)
The weed can't get no better (no better baby)",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-weed-song-lyrics

I'll never get over what some nigga told me:
""Did you know your nigga Wally got pap pap and put in a coffin?""
No! Why my nigga took a fall?
Saw my nigga try to swing them dums, (in the war) so we lost him
But, damn, why did ya have to kill 'um?
I never did think it'd be one of my trues to get caught up in redrum
I sit and I pray everyday: God, don't let me get smoked
Oh no, a nigga ain't scared to go, but I still got a lot to live for
But so did my nigga, my nigga--he gone
And all that he left are his memories
But when I die, you gon' see me
One, two, three, Wally rest in peace

Can a nigga tell me why so many my niggas had to die, so much pain
Even niggas in the hood is no good, puttin one to your own homie's brain
And a nigga gettin' high, thinkin' back, in the days when we did some fucked-up thangs
Now, I gotta ask God if that's the reason my homie's gone away
And I gotta give hate to you gangstas out there fakin' the funk
Actin' like you got a problem, but you're just too goddamned drunk
Put down your forties, pick up your fists, and handle that shit like men
Cause too many punks out there pumpin', thinkin' your gat is your friend

Come and take a good look deep into these thuggish-ruggish eyes, see the thugstas cry
And I'm askin' the good Lord ""Why?"" and sigh, he told me we live to die
Not another on the team with a dream that can deal with the struggles, like you Wally
I love you to death, but I wish I could have seen through your troubles
And it's hard to say good-bye to another...Bone
I'm feelin' all in the dumps, and all of a sudden, I'm so alone
Stay strong and hold on to a lifetime of memories
You're livin' off in my prayers
Gotta let the Man upstairs know that somebody cares
Just wait, and I'll be there

When I heard the word at Kerm's, Shorty said, ""Oh, my Lord,""
Layin' on the curb on a hundred and twenty-third, bled, dead to the world
How bad? And what about Looney, now? Damn, she gon' act a fool
Outa the blue, seemed to, she knew what happened to Wally, she lost her cool
Remember my thug, when I got mo' love. Sippin' on 8-ball
Used to tell him to pass the weed
I wish I could tell him to smoke it allNot my dogg

Creepin on Ah Come Up,Creepin On Ah Come Up,1994.0,"Right about now, Thugs-n-harmony is on a come up
So to all you bustas out there, beware
Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves

Woke up this morning with the thought of robbin' a bank to get rich
Ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click, bitch, gimme your shit
Fresh out the pen, and I'm low on ends, fuck calm, I tried to stay thug
Got flowin' skills, but niggas, they bitches, now I just can't buy my bud
With my steel, grabbed the forty-four mag plus a sack
And I snag my leather rag, can't reveal when I glide with the moneybag
Ride to the hide, count my flags. I be livin' on the darkside
And I can't escape, some say it's a phase
If it is, only way I'm gonna survive is if I play with my gauge
It's a raid
. Put your face to pave
If you try to play brave, you'll get slayed
Pull down them shades, empty your pockets, watches, jewels, and you'll be safe
I snatched the clerk up by her neck, put the gun in her mouth and said
""Bitch, you better move quick back to the safe
If you wanna be killed try some stupid shit
And pushin' that panic switch will get you nowhere but hell
""
Trail to the back with the money in the sack
Locked 'em all in the vault, time to bail
Well, tickets I'm out the door
Hopped in the smug, and I break fast
Get to my pad, sit back and laugh, loc'd out as I flip through my cash
At last, nigga made good, and I got away smooth
Now, I'm straight. Covered my tracks
Only description is that nigga with that leather face, fool
I gotta get mine, and if you stall, then I'm gunnin'
Just work your job, get paid. I'll rob ya
See, a nigga creep on a come up
Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves

See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down
Steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid
Gotta gauge at my waist that be spellin' out murder
That'll get a nigga locked the cage
Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause
What can I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullshit
But a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store
Select which one will I raid. Got be headin' downtown
Cause tonight's the night
Dressed in my black, wearin' makeup on my face
So a nigga can't be seen in the spotlight
Stole two cars, and I parked one north
Parked one east for the smooth switch
When a nigga bail, how the fuck he gonna tell if a
Nigga don't dwell in the same shit?
Climb to the roof, and I'm peepin' out the scene
And there's no one I can spot, so I get my ass down
Looked around through the window, and I broke the bitch out with a rock
Now I jump my ass in. Start to fillin' up the bag
And a nigga comin' up on these diamonds
Grabbed a couple herring bones, and some rings
And some (brooches), still thinkin' how them diamonds was shining
Went to the cash register, broke the bitch open
Grabbed all the money they had
And a nigga gettin' goin' gone to Bone, yeah
Got to let my niggas check out my bag
And I got away smooth, cause I had the shit planned
And ain't no bullshit get brung up
That's what I gotta do if I wanna get paid
Cause a nigga be creepin' on a come up
Stalkin' (gat fools), walkin' jack moves

Downin' Jamacian spliffs, little nigga Ripsta on this lick and bang bang
Nigga that's the click on my brain, ? another victim insane
Feel the murderous nerve
This twelve shot pump, and I gotta bigger gat to back me
Peelin' in my smug, thug, hoody, black skully, black khakis
Creepin' in my smug, so reapin', peek into the window, let me cock this
Nigga must've been meant to be jacked, cause here comes me hostage
Up outta the door, with a pump to her temple, shoulda seen her tremble
Push any alarms, and I drop them bombs on moms
It's just that simple. I took my conscience and fried 'em
Don't gimme no hassle, bitch, cause I've been scopin' for weeks
And I know y'all got some shit
Clack back me gun, hollow point mixed with dum-dum kickin'
Ladies and babies scream onto the floor
(""Shut up and listen!"") It's a jack move, fools
Give me the jewels, the dope, the weed, the cheese
And answer me: why and you hoes is cryin', cause bitches are dyin'?
Blood clot, here to be dead what one of them niggas said
Buckshots up into them dreads, and I love when I hear them pump red
One that callin' me bluff, I stuffed him with the quickness
He made out with a smooth thirty G's
So all bodies must bleed, I need no witness
So with a me slug, mo thug jumped into him smug,
 rolled the blunt up
Good stuff reefer, hitted the Bone to give up love to my thugs
Cause I done made it clean as fuck, and I flees the scene with a buck buck

If I Could Teach the World,The Art of War,1997.0,"Why do I stay high? Why do I stay high?

If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

How many mo days on this old earth can you see
It's a crime to me
So we should get ready for Armageddon
Cause I know God should be ready to roll
Do away with the wickedest shit like mr. police-man
And dog if you're ready then pump up ya fist in tha air
And then pray for the politicians freely; get an amen?
The last days of the last days

That's why I get high, that's why I get high
I'm holdin on to my soul
But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the dead cause I all I got
I got under my arm we fall
BONE BONE muggin runnin through your door
Hoes speakin of the last time that I past
Charlie wanna hear ya BONE
But I can't go wrong
When I flip it to my song
Better turn it up
Cause you love that Thuggish Ruggish Bone, Bone, Bone
Crossroads what real cruel world
Now I doubt the journey of those lost souls
Who meant so much why wasn't I chose?
But it will not stop clones
Those shots don't drop BONE
Nooooooo no BONE
But if I could teach the world to be a thug like me
Everybody be thuggin in heaven eternally

Everyday the world goes round and round
I see it's a small world after all
Cause I can go met and I greet with my fans
Smoke a little weed and have a little laugh with y'all
But every now and then I gets caught up in a playa hation
Lord what's wrong with the nation, erase em'
But if I could teach the world to be a thug just like me
You could live your lifestyle worry free
In the arms of the Lord eternally
No mystery, but check the essence of the story
The warrior wasteland warrior so true
Divine, it's mine, east 19-99
It's where ya gonna be find'in all of my kind, every time

If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

(if I, if I)
We stand as united, but fall if divided
My thugs are the tightest
Cause God is our guidance, and they only define us
As killer and fighters, cuz the critics n writers
Backstab when they typing our story
The war to be warrior, that’s for sure
And as thugs we're more and more and more

I got, we got, too much shit to give, got shit to give
Especially but still understood by the older folks and little kids
Come on all of y'all
Follow me BONE (Bone), way to go, we know the way to go
Follow me follow me BONE
And that's why I stay high cause I got shit to deal with
And the government and these playa-haters out to kill Wish
Wanna hurt this but uhuh
I got true mo thug niggas you just can't fuck with
Artillery you can't dung with
Nigga betta let it rest shit (shit)
To the little boys and girls all over the world
The shit that we say is for the streets not for you to go and do
Uh or to repeat, please if we can no more murder
How must I say this, if we can no more murder

If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)

 Fuck it, gimme one of them motherfuckers there, man
 Here, take that one and call me in the mornin, nigga

I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy, cause I'm floatin in ecstasy

As you can see I took the pill (I took the pill), right to the house
Grabbed a shot of liquor and pop, pop, popped it in my mouth
And I'm thinkin to my self that this might be a waste of my time
Cause what if I don't even get high
Thirty minutes done came by, I didn't even seem high
Until I stood up and looked at the ceilin for some reason
Now I'm tweakin, then I tried to walk but I was slow..
I guess I'm floatin in ecstasy (just like the nigga told me)

I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy

My name come alive, be told
And I'm pokin in somethin, oh damn but it ain't no joke
Cut guards and red beans
And for them niggas that follow me around for my mojo
Feelin so see... cause I'm floatin in ecstasy (alright)
Ahh, my nigga just call up the homey
To hook us up on that liquid G
And if these hoes don't wanna see, they gotta check the spot quickly
Im feelin way high, but I'm also feelin way low
But damn I'm stuck in between
Fuckin with broad boys and never get used
Just help, just throw in a few more
Diablos, nigga Flesh Bone so chill
I'm feelin it hump through my body, feelin hot and exotic
Feelin knocked out, feelin too sexy for my motherFUCKin self!
Gotta find my bitch and fuck her ass to death!

I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy
I feel so pillish pillish pillish, cause we floatin in ecstasy

Whose my nigga that told me the level?
I started to see the devil, nigga was floatin in ecstasy
Shit, I took the pill, couldn't feel nothin so I'm breakin
But about thirty more minutes later, nigga was on the couch fainted
Arms sweaty, man why in the fuck y'all let me do this?
Im lookin at my homegirl like I want her, nigga this some new shit
I realized, nigga took one step and started stumblin
And I was tryin to call my nigga but he couldn't hear me, so I guess I'm mumblin
Fall off into somethin, but I guess I'm on a mission
Tellin my niggas that I love 'em now but it ain't nobody listenin
Whistlin, hangin out tha window, need me some indo
'till I let go, like, me silky fine-ine, ine
Flown the expo, knock.. knock, knock at the door
But nigga was paranoid, so I grabbed my gun bucked it at the door
Ooh-wee, shit happens, my family got me faded
But I'm runnin a secret cous', cause a nigga can't take it
Shake it, if I can but I blend in with the killers
And I wish E was here to feel pillish (pillish, pillish)

I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy (come roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy ..
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy (don't roll with me)
I feel so violent, violent fuckin with that ecstasy ..

I've been smokin weed for a very long time, why should I change?
And plus they say that ecstasy shit fucks up the brain (brain)
Ah, why should I, just to get high, weed gets me high (weed gets me high)
""Nigga try this here,"" they said ""better then that there""
They say, ""ya like it (ya like it)"" so I tried it (I tried it)
I thought the shit'll have a nigga high and horny
Im high, but I'm too high, I wanna hurt somebody
Nigga you trippin, get a hold of that shit, and ride that high
But I'm trippin, body moves, won't nobody get hurt (hurt)

Groanin, groanin, groanin and she ain't even in the car
Layzie won't believe we high off the LSD
Would ya' slow down, we ridin on the highway
Get the wheel so I can go down on ya, I sever it on my own way
(ahh) She reachin feelin so zigidy zigidy zigidy
Got these bitches, fuckin them bitches
Baby be peeled off, peelin on, movin slow
And Bizzy be rock hard, tongue well and mean slow
We in the club drunk, fucked up, and still rollin
They know my pockets swollen, hold up, show them we rollin
We rollin, rollin, rollin and rollin, rollin, rollin
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rollin on that ecstasy
I feel so zigidy zigidy zigidy and we rollin on that ecstasy

Don't be fuckin' with my money, nigga no
See when Krayzie pull the pump, then I kill 'em all
Pump slugs, when blood hit the wall, watch 'em fall
Now dog who ya gonna call?
Puttin' niggas in the coffin where they probably better off
And Leatherface is not a punk bitch so a nigga just can't fuck me
Nigga better have me cash
Or I kill his whole family when the twelve gauge pump blast
Now test me
Never ever let a nigga ride when he think he fin to slide
Pop him in the spine, get him for the money
Nigga tried to play me and dash
And that's why me thugs just put slugs in that ass, fatally
And me never want to see no
Oh jealous muthafucka tried to keep a nigga ends low
If he scared to smoke a primo
Gotta go with the fiends and in the click is a no no
Gotta make that money man
Gimme all my change, it's a murder thang, now
Even in the dummy game

And I bet he know me takin' no more losses
Put 'em in a coffin, and they life is better off
And these niggas they don't know me they can't know me
Thought you had a homie, but ya fuckin' with the muthafuckin' Boss and

Nigga take it off thank ya please don't make me stank ya
Time to pay the bill, write your checks up all night
Catch a slug or chill, bill collectors better respect 'em
Mo Thug, sellin' drugs, pumpin' slugs all up in that rectum check 'em
Click-click, fall to the ground when the Glock pop nigga chest pump blood
And takin' too long, better drop it on down or ya catchin' two to the head
Shoulda gave 'em up bitch to the Mo Thug lunatic quick to pop, now you dead dead
Gotta pull that nine on the niggas everytime
Sellin' rocks on the nine-nine

Reachin' on back as we bail to pick up me shells
No slippin' the buck and the gauge spray
Sawed-off on the block cocked, ready to pop ya, now cause broke gets played
This dope get paid and nigga, come drop it down

Them callin' me Mr. Bill Collector
Needin' me money, won't ease up tonight

Yell bloody murda murda comin' ta serve ya

Remember that killa that nigga named Leatherface
Now if you a thug nigga pick up ya pump and buck it

Man put that shit out man
You ain't 'posed to be smokin' no muthafuckin' weed in court
Man that shit ain't cool man
(Okay order in the court)
Woman: The people versus Bone Thugs N Harmony
Case number C601999
Judge: Will The defendant please stand
Is there anything you wish to say on this matter
Before sentencing, Bizzy Bone?
Bizzy: No, man
Judge: Well the court sentences you to death by electric chair
(Some guy laughs)

We had to get 'em up wid two thugs
Runnin' side by side wid number one
Murda mo drop my guage on 'em
When the po-po chase
If they catch me barehanded I'm done
Rip's gripping the six shot pump, so spill it
Copper lettin' the lead off
Copper thought that he had me caught
Little Layzie blew his head off (aawwwwwww)
Get him up, and get up
The bullets they start to get lit up
Number one best start duckin' wid ah gun already buckin'
Bust me lead on the double Glock 'n
Where the fiends roll up for rocks 'n
This perfect getaway
From the pigs when I peel and I hit the fences
Rippin' up the trench and
I'm bailing while they trailing
Better in hell than in the cell
And it ain't no telling where the coppers be dwelling
One had spotted me, picked up a piece and shot at me
But I practice what I preach
And see that these slugs up in his body got him
Run, wid smoke coming from the barrel ah me gun
Hit the bend, oh what the dum dum I got yum yummed on the dead end
They set in, then they lead in
They wanting me off in the coffin
Cops from everywhere was yellin' and wailin' I went unconscious
From the stompin' taking ah loss, and waking up in the coffin
And without no stallin'
Cell I was tossed in to be arraigned at dawn and
Looking in the eyes of a judge
He knew right where to put that thug
Made to be so, wid no parole
In the hole but I won't budge
Sent me to deathrow
Watchin' the time by fly past
But Rip'll be sittin' mindless never spineless, in silence
Hoping I die fast, but chill
Never do, sleepa, gotta get put that on all me reefer
Somehow must beat ya, so peep out the creep or the reaper will meet ya

Bailin' on ah mission, flippin' the script
Betta check what the wind just blew in
Betta think again, it's a preacher wid ah grin
On ah mission for revenge, wid that Mack-10
Little nigga Rip, had to empty the clip
Gotta pump them slugs up in them cops
Steady made 'em drop Glock went pop pop
Goin' out like a thug on the double Glock
Back from hell and ready to bail
Time to hit they trail cause they wanted my nigga fried
Holdin' the Bible when I got a grenade I'ma go inside the squad
Gettin' ready for the rumble
When I heard them mumbles, pullin' me gauge in laughter
Keep buckin 'em faster all I was thinkin'
When I see them bustas scatter
Betta watch out for them buckshots
Cause them can't fade me gauge
Gotta bust them souls in the grave
So I'm buckin' them straight to the pave, can't be saved
I'm bucking, little Ripster reinforcements comin' in faster
Blast give my nigga Double Zs the MAC-10
Lettin' the gun gun blaze on they ass
Gotta rip in them chests through vests
MAC-10s, sawed off eruptions, got plenty ammunition
No missing listen destruction I'm bustin'
'Cause I'm making that getaway, bound to getaway
Niggas got to escape and it's never to late
When you dash and tryna' break
Nigga just can't test the Bone fate
We steadily runnin' duckin'
Comin' up to the front door barri-caded
And I pulled a grenade, tossed to the door, let it explode
And we made it, creepin' in the courtyard
So Krayzie feelin' safety coming
Hittin' the fence and jump in it quick
From Krayzie's TEC-9 bullets humming

Well it seems as if them two boys Bizzy and Layzie
Done got theyselves into another jam
Well I'd love to see them boys get theyself outta this one

Soon as I went in the smoke, rollin' real fast like a dog
And began wid a rage and the guage can't let go
They done labelled my nigga psychotic
Bitches is got him sittin' on deathrow
Scoping out the tower peeping the scene
So when my niggas trail
Screaming out one eighty seven and bail
Gotta get my nigga Rip out that cell, it's all over now
How my nigga number one disguised as the preacher
Won't be pullin' ah Bible mission for survival nigga so I creep the
TEC millimeter, somebody done pull the alarm now it's on
Slaughterin' Bone, sprayed off the tech
Gotta let 'em know which way was on
We got gone but them police was pullin' up quick nigga what's up
Quick bust in first when he hit that fence niggas got cut the fuck up
We steady bucking, steady duckin' buckin' while I was jumpin'
All we was thinking is don't get caught
Nigga like me get the gun running
Gunning fronting wid thugs gotta get to the smug
Turn around and we pump slugs, put 'em in the mud
And all across my face was the red that lay in blood
Dodging the who, make the gun flip wid ah swoo
Bailing back on wid my troops
I'm runnin' wid 4 crazy niggas
That's down wid they niggas they ain't scared to shoot
Now I'm rolling, no more than ah half ah mile we get stopped
Cops surround Bone, we load Glocks
And squeeze say fuck all these road blocks
Busted ah U, then put that bitch in reverse
And I get the swish and I push the button
That boy came out the trunk and
Put it in drive see that Souljah boy bucking
Back in the other direction
Po-po came quick then heat up
Niggas blast at each other
Open up they doors and they get they feet up
I jumped outta the car, had to jump over the hood
Cause I'm headin' straight for the woods
So the niggas they follow behind me
We getaway smooth, ah nigga made good
Came up quick to the hideout
Wait until midnight till we ride out
Hit ah car so we can drive out
While we waited we all got fried out, fool
If youse a thuggish ruggish thug nigga scream mo
Took one ah my niggas off deathrow now we got one mo to go

If you're down to glide and slide on the Clair, then let's ride
Tony Tone roll with Bone on the dark side
But when you come just bring your guns witcha
If your a busta niggas gone have fun witcha
So nigga don't get me wrong, my niggas
Swang them thangs, bang some brains
Slangin' yayo, it all remains the same

Step and you catchin some buck shots
Murder one on the Clair Nine Glock Glock
Mo Thug, whats up nigga get dropped
Put 'em in the mud, pop and I can't stop now
Niggas that I thug with kill
Pop to tha chest how does it feel
And nigga we peel caps
Pap, fin to get your wig cracked back
Killin' I'm buckin em down, I wish ya would
Try to get some, redrum, bitch
Nigga don't test my hood

A first degree murderin' wig splitta, grave digga
Diggin' a ditch, puttin' a bitch
And them snitches in the pit, so don't fuck with
Them niggas off the nine nine
The foundation of niggas commitin' a crime and murderin' every time
Nigga beware cuz here come the Clair
Mobbin' like them soldiers
Watch me fold ya
For actin' like somebody never told ya
So off we go, to the bloody row
Time to bless some souls, with that nine shot
Givin' props to the double Glock

Pump pump when I let my shell down
Hit a lick now gimmee the goodies and nigga me dash
I reach for the gauge and mash
Yell out 187 and blast
Nigga don't test nuts your luck's fucked
You feelin' around for the bone yard
Thuggin' off with the graveyard shift
Then comin' to pull your whole card, bitch
Scandalous niggas, dwellin' the Clair be servin' them chop chop's
We rippin' them guts with buck shotz, pop pop

You better be ready for this thug style
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Flesh, Wish them wicked now
We straight off the Glock Glock
Well don't get your wig's split now
East 99 follow me down to me strip as we trip to the darkside
Betta grab your pop, niggas be
Trippin' and flippin' as soon they get out
187 you're caught in a murder
Niggas up to no good
Po po, fuck no
They never could fuck with a thug ho

Pop pop givin up shotz to tha double Glock Glock 

Nuthin but them killas, straight up thuggas
Rippin bucks of bloody clothes
Gaugin' pump eruptions nickel trip and shut and fuck 'em down
Buckin' them coppas down
Round after round after round
Bloody bodies badges spreaded out on the ground
Ain't no sound, just the demons screamin' rest in peace
I guess you got ta suffer
Feeling good dip hollow point tip, got your wig split
And made your body rupture
Hunt my victims on a mission
Flippin' livin' on a darker side
Creepin' on your homicide
Let my nuts and my gauge hang low now walk on by
Boogie Nikke's on a night ride

Thuggin through my thuggish ass hood at night, with my pipe
Thuggin down the double Glock
Tryin' to get my serve on
Watchin' my back while six-five try to roll on
Put one to the suckas head and two up in his body
Now peep my creep I keep the reefer smoke all up inside me

We jumpin' up rough from the hood
We bailin' we thuggin' we lookin' like crooks
Could tell we be fatal, ready to roll
Know we willing and able
Rollin' with Ruthless bitch betta check my label
Murda dem, never come again
When the scandalous niggas set up
Bloody nigga 
trues

Eighty eight to ten five is the soldiers ghetto
Nigga don't take the wrong turn
You will enter the hood, wig splitters will cover your dome
At a cut where the thugs and hustlas roam
Cleveland Browns
Dogg Pound hoes, it's on

Let's begin in the mix, of a Clair player
You're liable to get your wigs split and dumped in a ditch bitch
Cause them thugs, sendin' them slugs
Leavin' em off in the cut in a puddle of blood say what
Don't make me go in my trench
Nigga ya got me bent
All fucked up,your luck's up, now gotta get sent
To your gravesite as John Doe for fuckin wit those...

It's them thugs runnin' amuck
On none but a slug all up in the territory
Never divide, go nationwide with the buck buck
So where you at, where you at?
I'm strapped and ready ta snap n yank a nigga's snapback
Split em Koolaid hats
In ta the graveyard
Pumped up betta get down
Step on tha Clair ta tear around
Chumps about to get struck

Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell, cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, 'cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga

Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me

What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin'
Years ago
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way -
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
""Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface.""
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak

Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga

Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since '93

Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?

But we chosen - God done blessed us with His potion

Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remember: eternal, it means for everlastin'

Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

I see five killer realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killers, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double-time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap. Wanna sound like?
Wanna be like? Nigga, we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin'
Outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag, I'm glad
Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a body bag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killer thug puttin' it down with

Everybody wanna rap like, rap like, rap like Bone Bone Bone
As we continue to pick up the pieces they follow us kings 'til the (sundown)
Deadly issues of telekinesis, better show love or (lay down)

Hold down, welcome to the showdown (showdown)
I think it's 'bout time Lil' Layzie let 'em know now
Take it to the streets and let the pump-pump go pow
Take my style, let me show you how I go wild
Now you playin with a fully grown man
With a fully blown plan and a fully loaded clip
I'mma go up in your shit, I don't play with little kids
I'll spank that ass, boy you know who we is? (Bone Bone)
My homies the greatest I roll with the best, see?
Who in the fuck wanna test, these
Niggas from the S-C-T, C-L-E? We got heat
Y'all know what happened to the thief
When the king catch him stealin, got his hands in the cookie jar
Off with his hand, fuck it off with his head
Make him stand front and center, let me see what the rookie got
Bet a nigga ain't got nothin, they bluffin
Tryin to come up on somethin, bubblin
I'mma say this really really really loud
Y'all wanna bubble I'll bust them, rush them
Trust him never, on a whole 'nother level
If God the creator then y'all niggas devils
The fight won't end 'til the war get settled
And Bone gon' win cause them Bone niggas rebels
Playa, yeah, nigga!


They don't wanna see me shine
Everybody wanna sound like Bone though, come back in the Bone zone
If you just beginnin with the daddy you don't know
They call me the granddad, Granddaddy of the Bone flow
Well little lazy rappers, obviously we never figured
This would be the lick and we'd be next to shine
And we got everybody screamin and singin
But these out-of-shape suckers need exercise
So I'mma get up in their mental
I'mma work 'em out over the instrumental
Give 'em a criminal rhythm, the lyrical nympho
Wanna see the wicked, better know what you're in fo'
First offense, that could be forgiven, you didn't know
Second time I got up in 'em like here we go
No matter what they sayin we still the most
Realest, that ever did it (did it) feel me flow
Everybody want a little bit of this
The lil' Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh
A little taste so they can test and make 'em see how we the best
And how we realer than the rest, don't flex cause the pump gon' get 'em
I'm like a bullet to the chest, suffer cardiac arrest
That's so hard that I can still get their heart and leave 'em dead
Give 'em all they can get
Send them suckas to the lyric cemetary or the rap hospital
Never no competition!


C'mon, now let me take you back to The Land
You know where, the heart of it all
In 1993 when we was up out the scene
The fellas with hell of a harmony with the flow hooked up with Eazy-E
Shook up the industry and y'all just in time, to get another facelift
Certainly this somethin that you wouldn't wanna miss
The drama when it hit the fan, we got 'em trippin off the gift
And split a wig up with a pretty sick twist
We working like a surgeon on your dome
Exactly what I cut you with is sharper than a scalpel
Actually, it's too many Bone Thug clones and they all malpractice
Arrested and send 'em to the gallows
My Trues brought a style that's unfound
And you can feel it naturally but we ain't no magicians
Really ain't no thang to make a fraud disappear
Steady givin what they love to hear
We make 'em listen up close, everybody know we got the dough
We choppin nothin but missiles, still the nigga who the greatest
Y'all lost, can't even afford the cost
This is authentic and nothin that's dealin with the worldwide bosses
We got the sauce, baby we got the juice
We keep 'em in a frenzy fiendin for mo'
On the ThugLine with F.B.G., 7th Sign and Mo Thug
Once again we about to blow, we about to blow
Set it off explode, set it off explode!


I'mma treat it like a race and I gotta win it
Ahead of you bums with the Bone flow Thug invented
Haters wonder why them thug niggas still gettin in
Nothin changed the game like we did so we here, still with it
Gotta tell the truth, we changed thangs
Bringin somethin new that's everlasting
I'mma keep it real, it's next to nothing
Doin the same thing is less creating
Flow just borin, your spit's just corny
What happened to old bitin self? Writin battles done face to face
I miss those days, these days
Ghost writers, fake artists with nothin to say
I'mma give it where it's due, my street dudes just stay cool
I know I got you when I need to pop it you'll let loose
And you don't wanna see a Thugsta hit with a Grey Goose
Or we could buy the bar, just stay cool and we good
Recognize street thug, coulda been all hood
The flow's so love, thugs reppin in all hoods
Pick up on it, never fully get it, this Bone flow
Smilin, hatin but you see me on the low low
In the game with the number one, straight from the Cleveland slums
Straight off the block, never hustle to the flo' though
Keep it or not, how them Bone Thugs came through
Yeah yeah, we took it to another level (level)
Level (level) level (level) yeahhh!


As soon as I'm receivin the call, now give me the ball
I run with the dawgs then keep the ball
Now meet me at the mall, you can check on every shelf on the wall
They makin money off the Bone Thugs, equipped for the show
With a knife in my back, everybody rappin fast
But the harmony ain't in it and now that's too much to pass
Now that's too much to ask
Let me pick up my brass ball style and change up, c'mon
My trigger finger's uncovered my carpel tunnel was gone
It was written and rippin problems like water flowin in humbles
I'm walkin with seven shovels, the grave diggers and others
Nobody understands the man, clones now shut up
I'm quicker than a boogey wicked monster, never just like the movie
We know when to pray to God, do whatever
We get the hustle on in the spring, fall
In summer and winter months we gon' praise - Jesus!
Don't even represent us like we ain't said nothin
Present the flow then grow, know where we come from
Sun gon' shine in, equinox rhymin
Layzie perfect timin, grab my gun!
What's up to my nigga young Hova, Twista

I proceed with the murders, servin' off in a coffin
You're fucked, because your niggas
They heard that I buck
So don't think you'll win when I got my steel
And I'm feelin it, when you feelin' a pain
Well, like I'm insane
And know I can throw the gauge if you complain
There's never another to go with a brother
While smutherin' suckers been goin' undercover
We leave 'em in gutters, ain't going to get caught
But who was the sucka that's squealed on a murder?
Well, 187 The weapon is kept and ya step and get learned a lesson
I grab my Smith & Wesson

Pumpin the flow of the lyric, I'm breakin em off with the radical texture
I'm one brother you could never get next ta
Flex your style, I'm gonna give em a lyrical pump of the rhythm of Cav
And crackin em up with the word of the wise
I be bringin em up in the flow of the funky dialect
I elect a flow for suckers that try a wreck
I spark the light of a head and be wakin em up and then cause a fly effect
I insist ya lay with the path of my rhythm and follow me like a scripture
Flowin this from my lung, a tongue twister
Mista, my style'll be makin a dent and be leavin the tracks bent
Steppin is the lyrical white gent, my english accent
Breakin em up and then makin em take in the smell of my funk I be kickin up in em
And then I'mma give em a lick of my lyrical lollypop, I'm gonna bring em into my doctrine
Rock, then the rhythm'll makin the clock spin blackwards
The funk of the rhythm'll snap, crackle and pop, then flow, oh
I'm makin em follow the path of a God and my track'll be blacker than Cocoa
This lyric I'm makin is dope, don't call it so-so
Don't dis the Tung Twista
Leavin the suckers soft as a whisper, Tung kiss ya like a sister

Be makin em hear it and manifest up in him that I'm a star to become
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hip-hop is becomin complicated, never be left hung

A lyrical twist be comin from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over will be stung
(How was the rhyme brung?)
From the tip of my tung 
(How was the rhyme brung?)
From among the tip of my tung
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin, but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Stirring this up like a chef or cook
I hear them say give me the recipe
Breakin this off in the fashion of an erection of an adventurous style
That I'mma use to just confuse and smart people then go dumb
You say me style be wack cause y'all can't manifest what I be sayin
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-fastest-rap-song-lyrics

Why you want me to show a nigga' Leatherface in me?
Don't fuck around, nigga, he's a real buck-'em-down
Nigga, motherfuck rappin', how 'bout fuckin' with me now, nigga?
Niggas get ya checks from ya broads, get high
Then your broads sneak ya keys from ya niggas and ride
Everybody wanna party, even the niggas with a problem
Hey, nigga, we can solve 'em, 'cause, bitch, we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, fuck you when you got beef
But you also got the clone styles and all Mo T

And went through shit in Cleveland with the band
Now look at me platinum, fuck the rap and tour

So high, so high like ladi-da-da-da
Ladi-da-da-da
So high, so high

Down Foe My Thang,Creepin On Ah Come Up,1994.0,"Creepin' up outta the woods, gotta give love to my hood
Smoke, and I choke, and I creep on a come up
Niggas be tryin run up, but I bust, and they drop to their death
Now they done up
Gun up, hunt my blunt up
Creepin' 'til sun up, feelin' slightly shady
Call me lightweight crazy, number one nigga little Layzie
Nigga don't wanna fight
Runnin' deadly thugsta soldiers, droppin' them thangs
Bone done told ya
Testin' nuts, so a nigga gonna have to show ya
Faded a nigga that stepped up. Let's slip in some shit
See 'em alls just stood up then put a foot up that ass
Had to blast that click-click
Sprayed the gauge, all cocked, and ready to spray down to the pave
Puttin' them souls up off in them graves
Dwell in Hell, they'll all lay slayed
Amazed, must I blaze
It's insane when I take that bud to the brain
Toke, choke, holdin' me smoke until-a me strained, feelin' no pain
Better be packin' your weapon, 'cause my shit is kept
And I'm ready to let loose sawed-off hangin'
Danglin' up under the trench, fin to blow that chest
But you shoulda wore a vest, fool, 'cause the Bone don't front
Nigga check or get wrecked
Got Flesh on the set, with his finger on a TEC
Loc'd out with the khakis and high techs
Respect them St. Clair thugs
Hustlin' drugs, gotta make that money, man
Rap be the thang, and the fact remains that we owns that rap game

Bang, bang, gotta get down for my thang
Bone be me gang

We runnin' with no hoes, and the bigger Bone that's
Known for gettin' his swerve on and kickin' it on the stage
Off in the rag, gettin' my serve on
So, leave 'em alone. They come
They need to be shown that Bone done chrome, blown
Lay slugs up in to them domes, so go on
You'd rather go run a ho check, if you wanna test nuts with Flesh
I'm feelin' to lynch ya, mo murda
You're runnin' up eye to eye with death
Praise the Flesh, now nevertheless you're takin' a loss
And this slug snuffed up, and dumpin' the body up off in a coffin
Remember the vow said a preacher, me teach 'em
Greetin' 'em with me nine, runnin' with thugs
And hustlas and murderin' 'em every time, nigga

Bang, bang, gotta get down for my thang
Bone be me gang

Remember the Ripsta, sinister creeper
Reapin' up that set with a street-sweeper
Gotta take a breather from sippin' me liter
Rippin' that flesh when I sneak with a meat cleaver
When I'm in me smug, never the studio thugsta
Buck 'em, buck 'em, motherfuck 'em
Thug never done bluff and fuck them bustas
So back up off me. No stack won't let me slip
When a nigga start to step, the weapon, put 'em in the graveyard
Bitch, better buy your vest, then test Rest, the Ripsta
Quick to pick up the hollow points
And put 'em up in your brains, nigga
My little nigga, Mo! Hart, my bigger nigga, Sin, dash fast
Get up with the block at last blast they ass, pass cash, then stash
Me can killa for free for homies and family
Tell 'em to see me, that realer nigga, the Ripsta, put 'em in rivers
It don't stop, drop P's to the SCT's and double Glock
Pop pop, here's the slug from the twelve gauge thug
You don't want fuck with, no buck with, Rip's breakin' 'em bustas
Blood, me fillin' 'em, like that nightmare, me murder
I show no mercy
Turn your back, clack back me gat, diggin' 'em in the dirt, see

Get ready to duck, bitch, or get fucked up
They never could fuck with me sawed-off pump
Bitch, if I'm flippin' or load my clip in, nigga, y'all all fucked
Gotta make my money
Slippin' me pump in my trench, and then click it
Now, nigga, it's rippin', steady clippin'
Not missin', thuggin' with me click
And now Leatherface
Takin' your life so ya best stay back
Tossin' the rest in a coffin, 'cause niggas be runnin' up, talkin' trash
Buck a guard while walkin' past
Bang, bang, gotta get down for my thangs
And I claim and hang with Ts
Niggas that make cheese for the green leaves
Gotta give peace, cause they swang these
Come, nigga, meet my hood
And fulla nothin' but thugs and hustlas: Sin never been no busta
He'll stuff and buck-buck 'em and dump 'em, bitch
Nigga, muthafuck 'em
Krayzie don't love 'em, put 'em to rest and run
So the po-po don't catch up--nigga can't be arrested
One M-11 me sendin' niggas to hell, a felon 187
Eleven dwellin' better from the cell
And nigga that pick up Mossberg
The quicker you to the curb
Put one to the temple, pump, to Mr. Policeman
That's all you heard

Bang, bang, gotta get down for my thang
Bone be me gang

20th Year Anniversary Cypher,UnKnown,2013.0,"Yeah (Buck! Buck!) come on y'all, it's goin' down
Shouts out to the homie D.O.C. (St. Clair)
Rest In Peace Eazy-E (St. Clair)
Mm-hmm, big ups Bone Thugs-n-Harmony and DJ Quik
It's going down y'all
We up in here, it's the cypher (Flesh-n-Bone)

See Flesh about to gash ya
No tellin' what me and my niggas 'bout to do to ya
We smash, leavin' you niggas without your nuts when we get through wit'cha
None of this shit is new to us, everybody keep doin' us
This is the era that my dogs created, they can't ruin us
Who be truer than us? I wonder what you might answer
These stupid hoes keep trying but don't come close
So they can't stand us
Stop tryna reprimand us
You niggas done lost yo' fuckin' mind, thinkin' you better
Just the thought of it is outlandish
I brandish an AK-47 then point it your way
""You dead"" they say
I'm handing out beatdowns every single motherfuckin' day!
Stay on this thug shit, there's no other way to make it bubble
I just might make shit pop but y'all don't want that kind of trouble
It's subtle whenever I slip into this mind state, y'all in danger
When I rip niggas apart, nothing left of them remain
So I'mma continue to let these niggas have it, and show no mercy
You fuckin' with ""one man army"" opponents never could hurt me
I'm playin' thuggin' when I'm on a mission, they say ""It ain't fair""
You niggas done had your warning
So why in the hell y'all have to take me there?
One thing you haters got fucked up about me, I ain't never scared
Come look me in my eyes and tell me if you see any fear
Still I'm that nigga from St. Clair, if you wanna question where I'm from
And where you from are them places that can't compare
You niggas ain't nothing but lessor, just walking dead as fuck
You're lucky to still be breathing my nigga but not for long, oh well
They finna get touched up heavily with this...
Touched up heavily with this rhythm, I'm givin' it to you raw
Hit 'em and niggas they feel it inside the dome as they broke off
Stack the 5th Dog, killing these hoes off softly, bitch now die slow
I send 'em to meet lil Deo, then they get sent to meet Diablo
Adios amigo, comprende? listen the way I say and slay
Nigga don't fuck around, see I'm serving these words I spray
Face it, nev'theless the fact ain't no escape, I chop your head
Pop it off your shoulder, then bury the head along with the hatchet
You niggas hardly expect it while you feel Flesh resurrection
Look at us sick and sore from stressing
Over the million dollar question: ""Something new, something new
When they gon' come with something new?""
But Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh gon' come with something new
You niggas ain't never heard it like some Flesh and the rest of my crew
Since my niggas the most bitten, here goes some more they can chew

High energy strong with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
(Bizzy Bone!)

Its the classical doc masterful savage rappers immacable
Average I spit it casual package it
What time is it? Niggas clock me, I'm cuckoo
Lose every muthafucking scruple
Nigga this Bizzy Bone, Google me internet style, YouTube
Hand it to Captain Kirk, I'm finna Cobain the Kool-Aid
Fuck what these fools say, I'm in the county, no food for 2 days
2 braids, a plastic bag of toothpaste and bullshit
First class to the crib, that's how them muthafucking shows is
Lean with it, Wayne's world (I like that; Come on, ha...)
Lean with it, Wayne's world, Karma throw her theme with it
Seen with it, better be better than last year, king with it
She wanted Chris 19, and I put some dream in it
Now let me put that A in the middle, right where the seam splitted
Tell one of these niggas to pass the pump and let me take a toke
Red Hot Chili Pepper, my nigga that was a good joke
5 percent of thinkin' let me poof pow be gone
Rest in peace Chris Lighty; my nigga move on
'9-5 eternally, weed smoking most certainly
Black widow blew perfectly, talking Eazy through surgery
Supple with the serpent no slurping nobody fucks with me
Company on the move, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's back to loving me!?!
See these animals outta the jungle we never will struggle I pick up the
Ball and if one of us fumble I go to the gutter
And get all my hustle it's back to the booth
Nigga let's bubble lets get in a shuffle, let's get in a scuffle
I say that we rumble and rustle up niggas we doing a cypher
Dear Lord, let a nigga be humble
Y'all still don't understand, y'all rappin' fast
Stealin' my brand that's a whole new plan, man I'm just sayin'
You siphon nigga Iraqi style, duck a nigga like Pacquiao
Broke rappers get mad so fuck you niggas, with a cash smile
I'm asphalt, salient salts solvents and vaults
Crispy weed, jars full of joints, bars, niggas lost
Faded the 'Bron Cleveland play, Miami like Weezy stay
Get me the fuck up outta here
Cock the pump, slap the clip into the Glock and spit it fast so that I can get it, go with it
For the block, meet the coppers on the corner where they sell rocks
So fitted tight like a glove acquitted, I'm OJ Simpson
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm Lupe Fiasco
These muthafuckas don't understand me I'm flippin'
Threateningly leave the kitchen
Cooking these scriptures in liquids
Sautée that lettering in skillets of harmony
Spices, no cinnamon with one more element some rhythm and
Ritalin rippin' 'em, no vitamins, Biblical flowing like Gideon's
Clack back me pump, hollow point mixed wit dum-dum kickin'
Rappers that laying all over the floor, shut up and listen
It's a jack move, stalking gat fools, I got some bad news
We finna get at you
Kickin'...that's when we pass through
Tried to leave us out the cypher, let them thugs have a glass with you
Mash with you, five niggas rappin' with a passion, fast with you
Rocks that makes me flash with you, smash with you and at you too
Bone don't move 'til I ask you to
See my goons will smash half of this room if I ask them to
Before I leave, better ask my dudes:
Ain't we the coldest group ever?
Word to Eazy, nigga with attitudes
Cleveland city avenues
Crack house is the death of our mentalists
Momma lended a track and Wally my niggas
Shit grin, make me grin again, me and my niggas gettin' it in
Y'all finna be coasting to that same Bone shit again

Nervous for a second, then the rest...
(Krayzie Bone!)
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum

I come with a militant vision for all them niggas, that's ready for lyrical war
Finna do way more than just even the score
The thugs we come for blood, so guard your grill
We are the deal, we all real, y'all already know who that
They never seen a rapper like me that's relevant yet I'm considered a throwback
Call it classic swag it's Kray Action Jack
I pick up the mic and they all say ""damn, bad man do that""
The game done studied me long time now, but it still can't seem to really get it
Niggas wicked, just admit it
My niggas the sickest with it
I pick up the pen and I go in like a surgeon
Verbally come to save a dying game 'cause it's hurtin'
I tell 'em to follow the leader
We keeping 'em stumbling, they better speed up
Y'all niggas can't tell me how this game don't need us, we up!
And get ball, first and ten, needing a touchdown once again
The game is over, niggas, once I'm in
I'm sneakin' up on 'em like I was the wind and blow 'em away
And shoo 'em the way
The fuck up outta here, the storm is coming today
And it's in the form of Kray
I tell 'em you should've been checked the forecast
I'm so bad, with the pen and the notepad I get up in your ass
So how in the hell is they doing the cypher
But never invited the illest spitters, realest niggas
Known to kick a little ass and after that, handle some business (Hey)
I figure they scared of the Thugs just cause we too real
Still runnin' with gats and bats and hoes you finna get hit with true steel
We one in a mill, we coming to kill 'em all
Less drama more music, so don't choose it
'Cause I got a pump and if it jump off I'm gon' use it
It's mister goddamn murderer, lyrically kill 'em permanent
And after I battle wit'chu, y'all gon' wanna forfeit the tournament
Competitors no concern in here
Heartbeat but it never did pump no fear
So thinkin' you finna come up in this bitch and just lean on me, that ain't fair
Sick of these lil' niggas running around like Bone ain't they daddy
Illegitimate bastard, some of them resemble me a little
But none of them get it like pappy
And tell your mammy I ain't payin' her nothing, so don't even ask me
Real nigga, I still keep my heat and crease my khakis
I'm finna get ill nigga take out your weapon 'cause nigga the beat done got me
They doubt me, but ask yourself just where would you be without me?
Been here 20 years, many years they still ain't ready for me
I'm constant run like the river nigga, I'm steady flowing
They tell me they love me, the way that I flip it or spit the harmony with it
Created the lane and step on this gas, so nigga don't bother me with it
They know that title belong to Bone
So nigga just leave it alone, and let us move on
I'm here with that Leather, my brotha, my niggas are sick with it
Real as it get with it
We on the mission to pick up the pieces and stick with it
Flow like I'm liquid, so slick with it
Roll with them niggas that used to be criminals
Now we just get in 'em lyrical
Niggas been acting like me and my niggas ain't good wit 'em now that the game went digital
Shame them niggas don't really know that we started it, fathered it, birthed it
We be the heart of it
So give me the beat, the melody really don't matter 'cause I'm killing all of it
I hit em up in they mind like a 9  'cause its
Murder murder kill kill redrum redrum redrum

Let the lil' man get a piece, fuck everybody
I slap niggas first anyway, nigga
(Layzie Bone!)

Who want it with Layzie, nigga, fuck you, pay me
Been doing is since the '80s, early '80s
Nobody can fade me, my partner in rhyme is still Krayzie
And we finna break bread
The rest of them niggas got laid down and play dead
With Bizzy and Wish and Flesh, I roll on them niggas
I never did play fair
We represent St. Clair
The struggle the grind, the grit and the muscle
The First of the Month, Foe tha Love of the Money
That Grammy the shit, that's how I hustle
Trust me, nope, them niggas don't want no trouble
Niggas be skeletons in my boneyard, trying to show hard
Nigga, I'll buck you, buck you
I cut like a Ginsu
Them niggas is going through what I done been through
I get in the cypher, I set niggas diapers on fire to show 'em what men do
They hut and attend to the order the generals call in the field
My 110 too, you're 50 percent and you claiming that real
Lay, that's why I'm hard to fade, Hall of Fame
Put me up in the Hall of Fame
Layzie Bone givin' you all the game
Y'all explain what's understood and never did have to be
Savagely I ravage beats, my money attracted magically
But I had the key, could've picked the lock, instead I chose to kick the door
Tragically it had to be for the ones that went form friend to foe
My thugs is indispensable, friendship is the principle
Boys to men to the end of the road, but Tha Crossroads not the pinnacle
It's a winner though, all original, it's history now I'mma make it stick
My nigga we 'bout to be Laker rich
That mystery murder man break a snitch
Taking trips, yep we party on plenty of acreage
The Bone be going for twenty years strong
Now how in the fuck can we fake this shit?
Bitch, yep I ride with 2 Glocks
Stick a rapper up for his new chain, hit 'em up like I'm 2Pac
Wanna do things? I move crowds cause that bang bang get too loud
Forever they callin' me young thug 'cause the unplugged is the new style now
Who in the fuck is claiming the best in the business
And where's the arena that niggas is playing in?
'Cause I'm 'bout to get wit 'em
I'm hearing king this, throne that
All the influenced Bone rap
Get ready my nigga we at it again, them other ones taking that long nap
Never met a click of five, mighty Mo Thug we still alive
FBG, yeah it's the life, Harmony Howse, and Seventh Sign
Perfect, nigga this A to Z and we workin'
Been around the globe with Steve Lo' shouts out to Full Surface
Nigga it's your time, Go time, I'mma bust in the low mine
Dangerous like a gold mine, clickin' up like Voltron
Biatch! (laugh)
(Wish Bone!)

Y'all niggas to quit that, this is real rap, y'all niggas need to sit back
Wanna learn a little somethin' from the teacher? I got that
Lyrical holder, spit fire, or smotherer, or get swolled up
I'm a grown man, with a life long plan, understand that?
It could go ugly, murders, how old do you think I am?
But I still got hands and I put 'em on ya
For the real rap era formula, I warned ya
Get missing, hood ceremony, got some ditches you bitches
At the same time, we move a life long hustle my niggas
Say sorry from the top, gotta lie, gotta have that money
Power, respect we earned that
Maintain twenty years in the game and Bone ain't done yet
You heard me, we ain't done yet
It ain't over 'til it's over, and it ain't over
Worst nightmare, don't you play with me
Or we can be partners, nigga, get money
Lamborghini dream, empty pocket realities, that's not for me, See me
We can part on the North Side, ride
And we gon' party on the East Side, ride
And we gon' party on the South Side, ride
We gonna keep it real in the West (West) for Eazy-E
Give me my shoes and I'mma run wit 'em
My story's far from the soft nigga, and I stand wit 'em
I got what you want and what you need
Only thing that makes me old school is this .38 snub
No clues, no fools, and plus my bad bitch she got  Ooh
It's amazing these niggas still playing, still praying
And all that's lost, especially the boss
And on that note, I'm lost
Y'all niggas go ahead and do this shit, I'm done
I love you Bri Bri

Young homie, think before you shoot, murderer
Where will our children go
When there's no place safe where they can go

And trouble may come and sometimes
You'll get pulled over by one-time
And when the 1999 rewinds, you didn't even make any strides
Murder all around the whole world, it's nauseatin
Everybody's hatin everybody, overrated
Why everybody actin agitated, I thought we graduated
Back in the saddle waitin, aboard the battle station
Hatin' is a birth defect and you know ain't nobody perfect
And when the curtains, close open up the door, no war, no war

See we losin this world we love
And it looks like the sinnin won't end

Ridin wit my 
Trues Humbly United Gathering Souls

My nigga let me hit it
Niggas we thugs and immortalized, let's get high
It's them niggas you most desire
I can remember from way back in the day
Comin up out the ghetto was a hell of a struggle
From sellin the fiends llello
But it was my dream to kick flows
And put my people on another level
Now could it be for the lust (lust)?
Could it be for the rush (rush)?
My niggas love when they bust
They steady buck and they duck
They put your dick in the dust

Anticipatin life without Satan hatin
And all enemies to hell, I'm sendin them

Everyday the devil at me
And I wish the Lord throw a Hummer at me, I ain't happy
Me and Eazy E in a B-E-N-Z, with my niggas right next to me
It's my legacy, we can't let it stop, uh uh, not now
The whole world endin up in buck-buck-pow
Corruption, destruction, disaster
Everybody tryna' rap faster than the master
Oh Lord, could you save my soul?
Nigga tryna go platinum 'round 40 years old
The Lord know we can do this shit
It ain't no stoppin us now cause we can prove this shit
Nigga me, Stew D, PD, Freaky G

Babies havin babies, Generation X
With the AIDS epidemic, we ain't cool no more
And I know they gotta cure for this shit
, we ain't rich
First we lost Eazy, then we lost Pac
Biggie got killed, when this shit gon' stop?
Everybody wanna know what's goin on

And if I don't die today, Im'a try an change the world

And let's change the world, and let's change the world
And let's change the world, and let's change the world

You need a lesson you can learn from rappin
But they try and ban it, realize that it ain't gon' happen
We done changed the world

Now I got my guns, better arm yourselfs
Most don't know what to do, if you don't know what to do
Don't you know this government ain't built for me and you

If we can't save ourselve, then let's save the kids
Let the world go, let these babies have somethin
Let the world go, just don't blow this muthafucka up

Layzie Bone is in the house, I'm gettin' it starrrted up
And it's my parrrt of the cut to let you know
That the harrrder not to haul, you're stuck
I get the gauge, and let it blast and get you shot
And then you drop, you're popped
So now I got to free the block
I'm breakin' 'em, takin' 'em, makin' 'em
Fakin' 'em, shakin' 'em off to a new height
I rocks the mic, yes, I'm hype
I love to write, so don't you bite
Yeah, I'm the Bone, that nigga that's on the microphone
You shoulda known, you're fuckin' with me, yeah, it's on
'Cause I got Krayzie and Bizzy Bone without a doubt
Wish Bone, and my bigger brother Stan Howse
So call your posse, you gonna need 'em
When the Bone's approachin', 'cause I be doin' a flow motion

We never get caught whenever we run
Because we throw bolo
I'm hypin' 'em up, and strikin' 'em up
To keep 'em in flow mo
You step and you're stuck
Now, what in the fuck is up with this dumb shit?
I'm packin' a 9 most all of the time, now back up, bitch!
I'm locked down all the time
Because I might go psycho
For drinkin' that Cisco, and poppin' my pistol
You're claimin' you're rough
I'm callin' your bluff—so, what's up, sucka?
I'm callin' my niggas, pullin' them triggers
Quicker than a mothafucka

I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow (flow) when I go (go) in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo
I flow when I go in flow mo

A 187, a lesson
For niggas who think they get with the Bone
The weapon is kept in a trench and
So give me the gat, at once you're shown
There's nothin' flow like flow mo
I roll with the Bone, no never go solo
Time and time again, think I'm gonna need for smoke 'em
So, so, no, no, 'cause I don't think
That Biz will ever back down
You cross our ways, so you sing
Then you chill in the background
I'm psycho and like Michael, no one on my level
Let's meet in the cemetery
And no, don't forget the shovels
(Layzie Bone: I'm diggin' a ditch]
For the sucka who thought that they could fade me
Chillin' with my nigga Wish, Layzie and Krayzie
The gauge be pointed at your temple in our land
My F-L-O-M-O-T-I-O-N can

Flow, flow, flow, flow
Flow, flow, flow, flow

Well, it's the nigga, the nigga, the nigga, the once again
And niggas they pick up the pen and they try to contend
See, all that they win is a MAC-10
It's blastin', pick up my gun
And you're runnin' now from the assassin
Pumpin' the clip and you askin'
""Who in the fuck was that masked man?""
The nigga that pulled the trigga
'Cause I'm slimmer they figured they bigger
But when you can see the real killer is peelin' your cap
Nigga that's runnin' the pack
They step, so pack the gat, tossin' your life
I proceed with the murders
Servin' off in a coffin, you're fucked
Because your niggas, they heard that I buck
So, don't think you'll win when I got my steel
And I'm feelin it, when you feelin' a pain
Well, like I'm insane
And know I can throw the gauge if you complain
There's never another to go with a brother
While smutherin' suckers been goin' undercover
We leave 'em in gutters, ain't goin' to get caught
But who was the sucka that's squealed on a murder?
Well, 187 the weapon is kept and
You step and get learned a lesson
I grab my Smith & Wesson for punks that run to test
And so punks get ready to drop

Just split up a blunt and me roll up a fat one, make it POD'ed
They label me killa, drug dealer and burn up nigga crazy weed and...

Blaze up a blunt, gotta have that hydro
Need me a hit of the tweed, make me drop to my knees
And I gotta give love to the green leaves
Steadily spendin' that cheese, feelin' at ease
Thuggin' on off in the cut now, when I'm checkin' on how this shit sound
In the Range smoked out with my nigga Tay
Smokin' that tweed 'til we fall in the grave

Make up the dummy to make up me money, weed run me
And headed for broke, smokin' the bong
Hit that bong wrong, make a me cough and choke
To the real OT's loc strong BONE

And holdin' the smoke 'til it's gone, real long and stay blown

Wanna get you fucked up, wanna get you fucked up

So I blow the other way and keep my focus clear, so sincere When I do it, I get into it, nobody does it better
Tougher than leather, fuckin' with me is like a never
Give me this track, I'll rip it in half, completely severed

Way beyond comparable and here's another parable
A group of young thugs from the streets with nowhere to go
We made it out the hood when it wasn't all good
Call it goin' for the gusto, armed with a deadly flow
They didn't figure that a nigga would pass the class
When the bell rang, I walked right passed the class
When the cell came, I banged and mashed for cash
So determined to have the last laugh
My dawgs above and beyond y'all
We attacked with rap and we sonned y'all
Gotta get it, I done been about my business so long with the Bone
Yeah, the Bone put it on y'all
Real niggas call it spade a spade
And since we made it great, we gettin' major pay
Catchin' major hate, holdin' major weight

Home,Thug World Order,1997.0,"I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in a tussle
Instead of usin' my muscle
And everytime I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game, now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number if it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man, got us all programmed
I'ma pump my fist, I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish, I never seen the abyss
And when I needed a ride, you wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my Cris, you niggas all on my dick
I wanna change the world, you wanna change your life
I wouldn't a put up a fight if I knew it was trite
They say everything happen for a reason
Can you tell me why there's niggas bleedin'?
Needin' general assistance out here, needin' public housing
Out here tryna make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet, but see, your brain is so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See, the real niggas ready out here taken control
See, I'm screamin' out Mo', with my pockets on swoll
Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' this stress to my spouse
'Cause I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out
If you niggas try to run up on the Bone
I'ma show you like this, I'ma pull out my chrome
I don't wanna have to send a nigga home
Lord, please take me home, come and take me home!

Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

Home, home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, home, home
Please take me home

When I'm lookin' at my money now
Thinkin' back to when I was livin' foul
I was runnin' wild, sur-vi-ving, 'cause I'm 9-to-5'ing
Even puttin' overtime if I had to grind
I was stayin' up, slangin' dubs, hangin' up on the block
Duckin' and dodgin' the cops clocked on the night-shift
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto
But we finally made it
Stay dedicated to the music we made, yeah
Now it's on Bone Thug, leave alone
Came back the next year, #1 platinum song
It blew up from the door—and what do you know?
(Oh no) Eazy, rest his soul
Left us in the mess, I don't regret it
But we better get up and get it, go
Everything's gon' wrong, since you left Bone
It never been right, I knew it woulda been on
We woulda been tight, we woulda been in the zone
Ridin' so high, up in the game: five thugs live
See, we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it
Right? But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now
They got me trippin' ready to flip
They got me trippin' ready to come get my chips
They got me trippin' loadin' the clips
They trippin', Lord, I feel like I'm losin' it
Right now, right now, now, now

So, take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

I'll never give in, I'll never give up
I'll let 'em live in, they sinnin', they pretend to be tough
Pretend to be tough, pretend to be blessed
They want money and women, it's never enough
They in a rush, hope nobody knows just too much
You better be good, you know up in the hood
And so, we give 'em the dough, fired out, laughin' up
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave
Not one of the slaves, one of the paid
And I'll be one of the same, stay hatin' the fake
On the television, runnin' around
Tellin' niggas be ready for hate
Guard Leathaface and the grin right up under my face
I steady debate the pain that I bring with hate
Sweet as the cake, I take another puff and shake
The smell of right it's all about guardin', guard the weak
Lost mommy, poppy left home
I miss Wish' Uncle Charlie
Sit list in the back tellin' his selection, his date is probly
Probly my mommy's song
Cryin' for the life of you gone
Just me and my destiny, let's roll, let's roll

Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember

When I lost my Uncle Charle a part of me went wrong
And it happened when the Bone was comin' up so strong
We just wanted him to see what we do
You motivated us at the shows we see too
And I really hope you live through what we spit on the song
You mighta been through somethin', hopin' nothin' like Bone
Like one said we'll never make it
Like two, thirty mil in they faces
And I really thought it was over, put us on and you left
Crossed over, back to the hood, we soldiers
The music nigga make it back, scandalous
But faith kicked in and the work shows that we winnin' now
Gotta keep it comin' food in my baby mouth
And things have changed like relationships
Ain't did nothin', now you wanna flip
Suin' people thangs you would've never made on your own
Now I wanna stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood
Bye, think I'm home
Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone
You can really help a busta if it ain't meant to be
With a little oohwee, with a little oohwee
I'm tired of tryin' to help these thugs
Lord, just guide em' home, guide 'em home!

So, take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
Ohhh Looord
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-home-lyrics

That nigga's stuck
That nigga's blasted
They got my man from the Land
Never ran, I step with deadly men
If ya come a little bit closer
I can turn you into sand
Now follow me, now roll, stroll down to Cleveland
We thuggin', we theivin', we put it in deep
And the blood is seepin'
Got niggas in alleys
Fuck niggas in badges, we say bang

Pumpin', Krayzie be bumpin', dumpin' the bloody body
Me never knew one that could flow with the tongue

To get the goods, Krayzie be thug

And I show them hoes up outta the Clair that thugs don't run from none
Follow rip one, now, on and on
Them definitely got me back
And I'm throwin' up St. Clair thugsta niggas
With or without my gat
Forever be ready to pull out me murder tools East 99 style, fools
Me put it in mind on murderin' you
Followin' whenever me murderous trues
Niggas that claim to bang bang
When it comes to slang thangs, they do
They know they cannot buck me
One of 'em sure to slug me
But they hope the thug I be, Bizzy
Better let 'em him be or they'll see
Nigga, hangin', swangin', never to miss. The Biz is me

With a sawed-off pump, shootin' craps
Hand on my strap, roll thick, cause they jack
Runnin' up on the Bone, you needin' to be pap pap
Soldier thugs be pumpin' them slugs
Defendin' they drugs
When they roll up, niggas be creepin' up slow
Heavy packed with they gats
And try to pull a hold up
But nigga, now hold on
Wanna test the Bone?
The gauge is shown, any is mind blown
Lookin' down the barrel of this Mossberg chrome to the dome
Bone, clack back me gauge in a rage

The trouble knocks
Steadily hittin', me clean up
Get lit up for ready your soul to burn
And I blow your shit up, get 'em on the get up

Yearnin' to earn cheese
Ready to die, so niggas can't take these
Wantin' to clock G's, want to move keys
Not takin' a loss on my green leaves, please

Strayin' on this road to hell
And prison walls, testin' balls
For the cause, gotta get that sale

Five, six, better load your clips
Seven, eight, we're gonna test your fate
Nine, ten, we're out to kill again
Straight from the burning flames of hell
A place where all assassins dwell
Put back on earth to destroy all worshippers of peace
Body bags and caskets and they all good seats
Together they form an organization much stronger than the mafia

Second, Layzie Bone AKA the Number One Assassin
Third, Bizzy Bone AKA Rest In Peace
Fourth, Wish Bone AKA straight-jacket nigga!

Murda, murda, murda, murda

Sold my soul to the devil
But I changed my mind now I want it back
But he won't co-orperate so now it's time to jack
Called RIP and Straight jacket
Number One Assassin is fully strapped
We belled through hell in khakis, locs, and black skully caps
So satan called his posse full of demons and witches
We met up at the Abyss ready to salughter the bitches
Yo, but wouldn't you know satan went out like a sucka
So I left a message in blood ""To be continued motherfucka""

Never praying at night
Cause the heavens don't want me
Sold my fuckin' soul so I can live through eternity
Killin' at night and watching victims in the daylight
A demon on the rise, and I'm snatchin' your fuckin' life
Been shot with a twelve gauge
I died and made front page
The devil sent me back and now I'm using the same gauge
Killin' like a maniac, livin' like a lunatic
Some would say the straight is sick
The devil's who you're fuckin' with

Murda, murda, murda, murda

I’m corrupt and demented, and not diminished by execution
A savage of torture should've been kept in a institution
Been shot in the head I ain't go out like a sucka
But I still died went to hell and just took over the muthafucka
Learned the devil's tricks an how to run this shit
I had a fall out with satan, and called his son a bitch
Repeating satanic verses but I changed the words now you worship me
The gates of hell on fire shooting flames can't be worse, G

Hell sent they call me RIP for a reason
I'm on a road to see bloody bodies just call me a demon
It's the psychopathic maniac, manglin' ladies stick a grenade in they pussy
The I start stranglin' babies
See, it's death to all my enemies that's RIP only tactic
But if by chance we kill each other our souls'll go at it
See I'm doggin' the triple six it's death by the sword
I told satan that I'm killin' him through the Ouija board

Murda, murda, murda, murda

Pick up the phone the war is on so get your weapons
RIP just spotted the devil around the corner from heaven with his crew
Drinking brews and im thinking "" Damn that's foolish""
Swig off the 40 of holy water and say ""Y'all let's do this""
Grabbed my click, gripped my dick
Walked with my face to the groung chanting
""Kill that motherfucka, now kill that motherfucka, now""
Unloaded on his ass and dumped him in his Abyss
And now his crew's on my dick because I'm Hell Sent

I'm standing in Hell with the gauge ready to buck
I'm coming for satan and my intentions is to fuck him up
Ain't been in the church they say ""No demons on holy dirt""
I'm fuckin Satan's bitches
He got mad and called body work
A lynchin' ain't shit compared to what I'm a give ya
I'm born and raised in hell and bitch I'm sent here to kill ya
I'm Rosemary's baby
There's no more evil like me
Cause when niggas think of death the motherfuckas picture me

Murda, murda, murda, murda

Let me call up my posse
We takin' over the underground
Yeah, satan and his boys the motherfuckas they going down
Man, I gotsta do it
I ain't down for a hassle
I kicked the gates into hell and started a riot in satan's castle
I'm sick of this war now check it something has got to give
We stormed to the back, and we took demons as hostages
You want your people to live?
Then you'll forever pay me rent
To stay in my knigdom because a nigga is Hell Sent

Now we're walking through satan's den
The demons respected RIP
I'm running this motherfucka, hell ain't shit
A demon told me that Lucifer said meet him at the black hole
I told him ""I'ma be there ain't no bitch in my soul""
And when I'm coming for your ass
Ain't no need to run
Because I'm so fuckin' ruthless I made the devil go buy a gun
Until we go at it, the RIP still won't repent
An appetite for bloody bodies

So either way we go about this goes, somebody's head gon' get blown
Bone gon' on with your bad self, now hey, hey, hey
Blowin' up your face with your pistols
And get with that buck and that bang, bang, bang
Nigga wanna roll with Bone, it's on, 'cause nigga, we cool, we cool
Don't forget, playa haters get that buck to the bang
All up in that body, got him, got him
We won't be slippin', we just might be peepin' you all the time
I'm comin', I'm gunnin' and I put that on the double nine

Shoot em' up always, hate when I break you off and you loss
And make it look to floss
Let there be coffins for all of your offspring
Now let there be coffins for all of your offspring
For the police on the corner, creepin' up
Here come them soldiers pullin' up
Better watch one of them St. Clair niggas
Put it in a gutter, better off and doze ya
Really know ya should've never been jumpin' up out your shit
You runnin' with a gang of bitches fool you
Ready when I'm ready to do it you
It in my thang but a buck, buck is small change
It's off in ten to say that they niggas was bullshittin'
And lil Bizzy maintain, nigga this the North Coast homie
That city where the St. Clair niggas sell dope
I hear police roll deep in the set, see none of us scared
And we show that it's on, bitch, bang
You feel the pitch of my trigger finger's a bitch
I done put it down with my click, and stood on my own
Two feet and I rest on the nine
I'll be fuckin' with y'all, slangin' my dogs
And em' all niggas been anxious lil' Bizzy, but it's all good
I still ball, and I know when ya roll
I'm snatchin' your souls with the Bone
We can show it, and since I'ma flow, and it's all of y'all realer
My niggas, I figured I'd let 'em all know it
Playas takin' up off the style, well, if you think I'm scared
You, dead wrong, did you think when I break you down

Shoot, shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot, shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot, shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Shoot, shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
12-gauges bust up in ya, playa haters we be quick to pin ya
You know we know, you don't wanna roll
'Cause when we give it to ya, we're gonna bring it to ya, oh yeah
12-gauges bust up in ya, playa haters we be quick to pin ya

Lord help me make up my mind
Which way do I turn when there's so much stress
Surroundin' me daily? This world's so cruel and shady
And I really do miss my baby, Baby Boi, oh boy
Me and yo' bigger brother we keeps it realer
You'll always be our lil' nigga, and I know yo' mama miss ya
Picture the day when I get my callin' but until then
I guess I'm stuck 
Little T, know I miss him much, when I get to heaven Baby Boi, What's up?
We can ride and roll, I know
Without these Po-Po trailin', bailin'
All the way to heaven betcha that's a promise
Comin' with tha bombs (bombs)
Niggas can't test us, creep defeat is all ya meet
Rollin with tha niggas that pack the heat
And a sack of weed, straight out of control
Testin souls, hoes, niggeroes, playa haters
And tha po-po as well, Nigga need Mail, everybody need mail, and we livin' in hell
Nigga really can't tell, So I, Prepare for the worst and I hope for the best
And the rest as written, some wanna treat me
Like I'm forbidden, but I'm just lookin' for the shit that's hidden
Could I be? Come a little bit closer
Why you cautious when you approach us?
Is ya scared of tha fact we soldiers?
Mo' Thug Records finna take shit over
Under my halo pray mo' say Mo' Thug wit love
To tha depth that tha game goes
Die all you hoes, foes, and you po-pos
Nigga better roll or get rolled over
We shuttin' shit down, and you
Know a nigga love to get buck wild
Pow come fuck wit me now

Thuggin, love sick, my hood is in drug prison
The end, is my mission, we heatin shit, why vision?
Been crooked, red handed sin is beginnin of my endin
I went in my benz, but, Why is my mind spinnin?
And then I'll say hey, fuck it
My family ain't livin' for nothin'
But strugglin was one of the reasons I'm thuggin
And steady stayed hustlin, where was my lovin?
Somebody tell me somethin, good for nothin
If I give you, what'll you touch?
Will you fuck it all up for the love of lust?
Hoes, I love you so, but unlike my friend you're just my foe
Peace till the end of the road, that's where I'll go
But no, nigga don't lose your soul
But it's so cold, Trust in mine, alright then we can roll.

This is my family, this is my family, my family
This is my family, this is my family, my family
This is my family, this is my family, my family
This is my family, this is my family, my family..

Was ya, too young, mama, and daddy, when ya
Lay down and had some eggs?
I remember y'all breakin' up
And shippin us off back to the land, damn
What went wrong? Was it me? But I ain't mad at'cha
Cause outta all that shit I got two sista's and a brother
And I learned to harmony
On the streets, of tha Clair, that's where
I'm from y'all, on the streets of tha Clair
That's where I met Bone Thugs y'all
Aw shit, time to be a man
Gotta get out tha house cause I can't stand mommy's man
He talks with his hands
Come come creep on tha streets with me
That's where I learned how to sell drugs
It's where I learned how to pump slugs
It's necessary, necessary for me to get down for mine
So I creep and I grind
*knock knock* kickin down doors
Kill a nigga, sleep
Give it up or your dyin
And I know that shit was wrong but
Don't blame me, blame tha thugsta in me
Cause that's where that shit comes from 
Bloody red rum, nigga, we nuttin' but survivors
Rest in peace to the gang that collide with us
We survivors,that's why we be..

This is my family, this is my family, my family
This is my family, this is my family, my family
This is my family, this is my family, my family..

Don't fuck around and get zipped in a body bag
Off in the grave and yo brains'll be hangin'
Damaged bodies dragged offff
Everyday we see mo' niggas hatin', fakin'
Playa hation, it's getting contagious
Why do these niggas think they can break us?
When I grab my pump y'all niggas
Better try to grab what's left of your chest
Niggas be talkin' and then they get caught up in shit, now meet them faces of death
We let'em keep talkin' man they dogged us man it's all the same
But what do we gain by givin' you niggas fame?
So we let the record show
Tha 44 mag'll tag em
Stack up them niggas who try to compete with the platinum
Harmony, callin me, follow me down to me corner
Slip up and ya gonna get blasted
What do you wanna test me for? Jealousy, nigga drop
Nigga we betcha plottin, that's why them triggaz be cocked, every time!
Shoot em, 99 times out of 100 we gon' hit somebody
Somebody gonna take a strippin, yeah!
Y'all niggas get carried off wit them bodies, mo mightiest
You'll find us, smokin' that grass
Nigga pass tha pump, hey RIP, they takin a loss and wakin up in that coffin
Oh we gettin at all of these playa hatas man, but when we come they run
But we're gonna catch'em and one day God forgive me
I don't know what got inna me, but pin me nigga, they'll all fall down
Way down face down, ain't got nothin but love
Still niggas wanna test my nuts

Leather face comin' to kill them at night
Die Die Die
So must we buck them studio thugstas I'm...
Willing and ready to ride

Lie down with your hands behind your back

Naw bitch you lie your funky ass on the ground..now
This seemingly routine investigation
Had become a horrible nightmare..

Running with gats and bats
So nigga don't test rest or you get a peeled cap
Pap pap that pump better check that gun
For a nigga done get that skull cracked
Lil' Rip done rolled up
The bigger the nigga the quicker get showed up
Let's swerve to the burbs set up a hold up
So many bodies me blowed up
Nuts bucks and guts nigga mistakin' them balls for dogs
All niggas'll get mauled no thang to pick up a pole & flip on all y'all
And I never hoe’d out, especially when I’m rose’d out
Bet I bringin' in them guns run a thug get low down
You don't wanna get nutted cause' nigga you gonna get bloody
Once you see the braids and skully
Cuttin' that throat when I'm rippin' up somethin' lovely
What is it in ya? deep in the dead when we get fried
POD when I comes to ride
Creep but you sleep and then fall in the night
Once inside forgettin' about remorse your curse will ride
Cry now when you're ready to lie down
When I'm weak in a mental state
Somebody gonna die now
Meanwhile swerve to the burbs

Man he just all of a sudden just jumped out of a window
I didn't know what was goin' on I'm just walkin' by
Just got a bottle of wine..
I was just walkin' by
And all I seen was him jump when that lady yelled
(And that was it.) I don't know?
Well I saw his wife begging him
And she said ""don't jump"" and he did
Did you know the guy?
He sure had a problem
That's all I could tell ya
All I seen was them put the lady in a police car
And take her I guess it was his wife",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-die-die-die-lyrics

Cause it's a government conspiracy (With me)
These fugazis won't be fuckin with me (With me)
Cause it's a government conspiracy (With me)
These fugazis won't be fuckin with me (With me)
Cause it's a government conspiracy (With me)
(Verse 1, Layzie Bone)
It's a wonder why niggas can't get on they feet
We try and we try, but we suffer defeat
Never the less, we still stuck in these streets
Try to compete up against the elite
Everything's so corrupted, headed for destruction
The rich could help, but they don't do nothin
So I thought I'd just say a little somethin
Government tell lies, they frontin
Think about the money that they spendin on the war
People still sick, and it's people still poor
Hungry little kids bein locked outdoor
America over there fightin for oil
Plenty of solutions to wipe our polutions
I'ma tell the truth, since y'all don't know
Better open your mind, take time to grow
Illuminati, population control
Plot-plot-plot, they killin us dead
Hear us on the radio, but they won't play it
They know what it is, but they too scared
FCC probably have they head, just don't care
Mama's on welfare, daddy locked up for the rest of his life
Bob Barker is the prison he in, talkin about the price is right
I'ma light the light, cause ain't no fear in me
Tell y'all about this conspiracy
Like my name favorite flavor, Chuck D
I'm the new Public Enemy
They say this Hennessey, is bad for me
But I'ma go'on head, pour me a cup
Cause it seem like, we already fucked
So I might as well just press my luck
(Hook)
(Verse 2, Bizzy Bone)
What a conspiracy, seriously baby
Man, we are the riders
So many beautiful ones inside us on this grainular climates
O-zone, it's gettin closer and closure
How does a toaster, let us solar power these panels
With wind gusts and odors
Alaska meltin by the seconds, I recon
We need some prayers
Gather all the snow we can conger
And saturate oceans neighbors
Gotta be, sharp as razors just like Generals and Majors
Elite, if I could speak, hear my cry from the savior
Hey bruh, you still love me, all that I wanted was change
I know that it's strange
But I'm from the Manjor, I was brought up with great change
For the better man, goverment officials don't even know
No more secrets, I can hear it, and I can see it, fo sho
Dear Lord, if I can speak without bein murdered and killed
Whatever happens, Allah I love you, you are will
The slave Serpent is here
I'm with Jesus Christ, Your child
Star rocker, glory thing
Forever, Christ my pal
(Hook)
(Verse 3, Layzie Bone)
Conspiracy theory, call it H.I.V
Took my mentor, Eazy-E
He was rollin with the B.O.N.E
But it didn't add up to me
We was friends, a bird flyin up on stage
Nigga was strong, didn't look like Aids
Cut the curls and started wearin them braids
With them Cleveland boys, we was bout to get paid
But he had to move things out the way
And he had a lot of things to say
So he got rid of Jerry Heller
He was very jealous, I remember that day
And then in December he took us to New York, we was bout to blow
He bought us all leather jackets
We was wearin khakis, it was so damn cold
And the Cube got to kick it that night
That night at the tunnel was legendary
Wasn't nothin nobody could tell me
N.W.A. you feel me?
Then we headed back to L.A
Nigga had a new plan, but E got sick
Then he went to Jerry Helen's doctor
Damn E, why you do that shit?
Took a shot for the flu, now what did that do?
Little E got worse, it was very scary
We thought it was temporary
He was diagnosed, in January
In February, it was full-blown
Then March, little E was gone
Somebody explain that
While Magic Johnson's still kickin it strong
(Hook)
(Outro, Layzie Bone)
Yeah man, we was out there in New York in December, man
With that boy Eazy-E, kicked it real big
It was cold as fuck out there, man
You know what I mean? It was like 80 degrees in L.A
So when we got out there he bought us new leather coats and all that good shit
Then, ya know, we kicked it at the tunnel with the boy Ice Cube
So this N.W.A., Bone Thugs thang, it was real big
So we come back, E got a motherfuckin common cold
He goes to Jerry Heller's doctor after he fired Jerry Heller
Next thing we know, next month, January
Eazy-E, is H.I.V. positive
February, Eazy-E is full-blown Aids
Next thang we know, March, Eazy-E is dead
That's a conspiracy man, ain't never heard of that
I thought it took years for H.I.V. to develop
What the fuck is goin on out here?",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-conspiracy-lyrics

Never Forget Me,Strength & Loyalty,2007.0,"I'm gon' make sure you never forget me
{*cell door slams*} Konvict, Konvict...

Goin through the struggles every day on this pavement
In every hood I see 'em doin the same
There's a lot of haters that don't want me to make it
All I want is for you to remember my name
So that you'll never forget meeeee (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh
So that you'll never forget meeeee (forget me)
So that you never forget me, oh-ohhh-oh

When I'm dead and gone
They gon' remember me as bein one of the livest
Genuine ghetto survivors, when they think terror
Inside I pop in they mind, a silent killer
Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga
With lyrics more potent than a viper's venom
One bite could kill 'em
When I get in 'em niggas never knew what'd hit 'em
Legends, for what we done did on the streets
And what we done spit on these records
Blessings, we take 'em and put 'em on beats
And we give 'em back, no question
Granddaddy of the Midwest, Krayzie Jackson
The lyrical serial killer, I feel I'm the illest
Of niggas that's askin about the mind I master
When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster
Than half of these niggas rappin
When it comes to the grind I'm mashin
No time for second chances
When it all goes down (down)
When they put me in my grave
It's ""Fuck 'Em All"" across my tombstone
And bury me with my gauge (gauge)


My reputation is solid gold
And my street cred is all polished y'all
Known as a little boss hog in the hood
Boy in my hood I'm a superstar
Niggas in the past try to hold a nigga down
But I put in my work and checked it, checked it
Now these niggas respect it
Knowin I'm the wrong one they wanna mess with
From the gutter, with my brothers
Knowin these ghetto streets they don't love us
Duckin these undercovers, these motherfuckers
Doin everything to try to bust us
But these suckas, know they can't touch us
They envy deep in they hearts
If they ever, try to rush us
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart
Niggas go hard, from the start
Nigga this Nina Ross is my bodyguard
Fuck with mine and I'll charge
Little crazy-ass nigga at large
Wheelin cars, on these lanes
Niggas I never let go of my heat
Yeah, a stand-up man on his feet
Lil' Layzie Bone on the creep; 'member, me


What I got to do for you not to forget
Who brought you that straight Thug spit
Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk
With that Harmony all over it, hey!
Bone sing (sing) do it mixed in with that street talk
And with no delay, Eazy-E let's get our creep on
And then he went home (home)
But it's all good (good)
He left the right ones
Through us he's still in the hood
Rest in peace (peace) E
Like him when I die I hope they remember me (me)
That's why I no lie when I reach you with these beats
Took a lot from nothin
Remember the Thugs for the songs that we sung
And makin it through that struggle, that struggle
It ain't easy believe me, we breezy believe it
Still goin on hustlin bein strong
But I do it so they remember me

With my mighty-mighty warriors

It's all real what you see
I said it's all real (it's just the thug in me)

Nigga just because Krayzie quiet speak less
Don't be mistaking my kindness for weakness
Humble but ready to rumble
My violent side I can't deny
I'm like a Jekyl and Hyde, gemini
Look if you see me quiet, then I'm plotting to riot
Why tell me why tell me why
In they eyes I'm labeled a menace but I like it
Destroy ya, paranoia will make me blow you away, but hey
Nigga got too close to me
And that ain't how it's supposed to be
Nigga want respect but what do you show me
You, playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall
Better act like you know I'm rolling with Mo, posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doing our best to obey god Violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga, gotta get up and come and get it if it's really coming
Now I got it and I'ma floor these niggas acting crazy

Krayzie got nothing but the real thing baby
We come with nothing but the real thing baby
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing
The real thing, thing

Baby now this is the sound of me and my trues we put this down way down
So now if you hear me releasing some shells
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down
On the darkside take a look and you'll find true niggas like no other kind
Nigga say fuck the wine
Indo inside, swisher sweet get me high

Ain't nothing get to nothing something got to be real, real Something got to be real
Ain't nothing get to nothing something got to be real, real Something got to be real

Aim the 12 gauge pump and my lead go
Give it up for the bloody murda mo

Meet Me in the Sky,Uni5: The World’s Enemy,2010.0,"(Hook: K-Young & Layzie Bone)
You can you meet me meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky
You could meet me in the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky, the sky
Cause we flyin' above the haters!
They done gave me my wings
Lets fly, high, high, high, high (4X)
Cause we flyin' above the skyscrapers!
(Verse 1: Layzie Bone)
I done made it up the mountain lookin' down on the valley
And I'm feelin' I can fly so I dive off the cliff
Hear the little kids scream they don't know I got wings
Til I sprinkle them with the dreams and I hit 'em with the gift
Say bye bye to them haters (haters), no more lies
They can't fade us (fade us), why they wanna test
Now you rockin' with the best and my whole fam fam is the greatest, greatest
Moves countin' like a calculator evaluate the master
Playas operation stack your paper captivatin money makers
Feel the love from above he's an eagle he's a dove call him Bone's emancipator
Everybody's a congratulator
Come and ride on this elevator
Better yet take this escalator
Graduate to the new skyscrapers
(Verse 2: Flesh -N- Bone)
When we put 'em on a level that's if you can deal with!
We take it to 'em runnin' nothin' but realness!
Surely livin' in the life it's for the thrills
We went up and over the hill
Went through the whole drill
Haters try to kill with kindness but there's nothin' they can do to the finest
Though they won't dare cross over the line for tryin'
Y'all know what's gonna happen so they might as well remain behind us, way behind
We on the hardcore grind
I never take my mission for granted since I'm cool they go and take it for weakness
Better take it in stride
They don't wanna see us alive but yet we steady creepin', reapin', weepin'
Niggas went and got in way too deep in (deep in)
You gotta practice that before you start preachin' (preachin')
But ain't no way that they can keep up (keep up)
Cause we keepin' the heat on it really don't matter where we can meet up
(Hook)
(Verse 3: Wish Bone)
Nigga had it bad
Cause I never had more than plenty cash
Thinkin' that the rainy days was over
Livin' in the past livin' ghetto fab
Never lookin' back
But the fact is that I never went nowhere
The truth is me and my own ghetto got a love affair (love affair)
It's so real things we did my conscience outta here
I don't care I deserve everything I earn
Hell yeah I deserve some pain
I know I hurt
Stop talkin' night walkin' real night stalkers, zoners, hungry heard it here first
Don't believe me
With wings I'll meet ya
(Verse 4: Krayzie Bone)
Playa, hater, hate
They can hate me but they better stay away or see Krayzie loc' insane
So if they wanna hate me let 'em hate me from the bottom, way up underneath my feet
Cause really I done turned a new leaf
To never ever let the suckas rise or let them bustas kill the high
Cause they jealous in the mind
They remind me of gravity always grabbin' at me, pullin' me down
Bad storm for the flight, keepin' me on the ground
Still I rise and when I takeoff they fall (they fall, they fall)
Raise to the ceiling, try and stay away from the pretender
You don't really even get involved (volved)
We play em all from afar in a distance (distance)
(Hook)
(Verse 5: Bizzy Bone)
And when I met him in the sky
He had a body like a man and the lower body tellin' The Lord
That he had a plan to make Him sure I wasn't evil
But I'm comin' with my people ain't no sequel ain't no women ain't no vessels
I'mma settle with a scepter and a lethal dosage
I will live forever with a serpent on my head
Little glory that's my man I'll be damned
If I comin' through I'm runnin' with my pistol
Weren't for Moses ima die but ima come back wit' ya (wit' ya, wit' ya)
That's the way to get ya (get ya)
Picture sinister plots
I'm not nigga with no land I imagine a strand of lightning bolts and tightened ropes
I'm fightin' folk with no hope
Earth got me loc'ed now chillin' in the smoke house
No doubt, no clout, now we're goin' all out
Earthball that's all
Never let the devil call
Revelations little Biggie nigga so long, go long
Metal was so precious I was resurrected, why?
Juniors fly to The Creator
And my brother be, brother be 'C', throw it up

See Me Shine,Uni5: The World’s Enemy,2009.0,"They don't wanna see me shine, don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly, don't wanna see me ride
They don't wanna see me shine, don't wanna see me shine
Don't wanna see me fly, don't wanna see me ride

Smilin in my face-face, fakin on the side
They don't wanna see me shine (cause they don't wanna)

As long as I'm alive no hater gon' ever stop my drive
I, get it and make it multiply, anything else is suicide
Enemy of the world, that's I; energy of an eagle eye
See no evil and hear no lie, niggas don't wanna see me fly
Higher than a rocket ship, life is not rocket science
Every day is documented, all of my time is occupied
I'm gon' grind, I'm gon' shine, ballin 'til the end of time
Hate on me then it's all fine, you just ain't no friend of mine

I'm tryin to focus on bigger and better thangs
With so many odds against me I had to step up my game
Imagine problems with crooked coppers, why they wanna go there?
Tried to pop me, lock me, but couldn't knock me off my square
I'm not surprised, you haters wanted to see Flesh stretched out
Without one Thug, while I'm steady stressin out
But we doin our own thang, the Bone thang
You suckas fail every time tryin to stop my shine

Stay away, fade away playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
I need you to stay away, fade away playa hater
Stay away, fade away, playa hater
24/7 grindin, tryin to get my shine on
That don't give 'em a reason to hate me, hate me, hate me
But I know my mind's strong, none of you suckas can break me
Ha, nothin can save ya now, they caught the Krayzie vapors
Stay away, fade away, playa haters
There's really no need to be crowdin me cause I can't deal with you haters surroundin me
Houndin me tryin to get my paper, hard to keep my faith up
It's time for me to raise up, and do the sucka shaker
Truuuuuuuuue T-H-U-G's

See meeeee - stack your paper they hate my grind
Catch meeeee - push that's why I got my swagger down
But never slip in the clip in, I know they want my life
Any weakness, not here, they know that Wish gon' ride, ride
Hit the streets with that better love
Watch out if you kiss and tell, you know not to show 'em love
It's just that they talk too much, they never know who to trust
And just when you get enough, a target you will become
That's just the game they play

It's the devil's perpetuation, tryin to take my innocence
It's my retaliation, I don't need no ignorance
I'm standin against this army with Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Harmony
Danger is just a part of me like it's stuck in my arteries
These poor playa haters are the motivators, but I get my paper paper
Same rappers that hate us call for verses so we can tape for them
Critics we can't escape from them, don't you drink too much Hennessy

Deeply dreaming about this demon my daddy told me it was comin
Trapped in the form of a bad omen it's wicked it was written I'll be
Runnin while turnin around and blastin back to buck 'em fuck 'em
Them fools come back like I'm ready for war is that all you got
Heard the mack was talkin this and that bout some of my incidents

My mental seduction run your whole sound suction abduction of lyrics
Is the loss of life love and spirits
Capital offense for generics lost in the prison
Lieutenants overseeing the barracks checkin in
Mark ass copy cat incoherance is crucial
Smokin hay with conflicts that bite shit like microchips
I watch you ride the rodeo straight to the bottom
When you're fate rotten, bitch, when I spot 'em I'mma drop 'em

Surrounded by violence my nigga I'm bound to just live a lifetime
And this shrink wanna get inmy head cause I'm amongst the walking dead
All I really said if you niggas don't fled you gone bleed bloody red
Nigga shoot the spot and got ghosts fuckin with the mastermind of all time
Letting niggas know we off in our prime
It'll be that way to ninety-ninety-nine
Criminal-minded niggas been blinded
Looking for a style like Bone but can't see me
Just like mike everybody wanna be me
Study every movie nigga makin on tv
Easy does it do it easy what it is number one better check the score
Here we go nigga don't wanna fight no more
But I'm ready for you hoes and that's for sure

When the ghetto needs me I'll be grippin to the scripture picture
Little Ripsta can I get critical
And I'm seldom seen in the henessey when I ride up on my enemies
Zero one of my heroes Jesus blessed me to be lethal
With my automatic let you have it you don't wanna see any evil
Motherfuckers I'll take it to the people
Then I will meet you at the funeral
Get 'em up Bizzy Mafiaso no witness is the usual
Further mo murder mo ready with guns I'll serve you hoes
When they call niggas hit the road
And when they get killed I'mma get your soul

You thinkin I'm slippin with niggas that itchin to rob me
Yes they want to give me bloody body
By pumping a couple of slugs inside me
But I'll be damned we won if it comes to guns and I'm
Stacking them thangs so you gets none statics automatic fun
Want some come come come execution redrum rum
See what you see in my eyes murder murder death defied
Burnt alive fried when they die
No one was able to find them cause they're bodies went up in a fire
Fuck they family try to creep
But you think I'm asleep cause I'm pumpin beats
Nigga better believe we keep much heat up under my seat yeah
Shoot 'em up quick in a minute and within a minute
You already suckas I bet that you bent it we sent it
We'll atest for the murder we should we dealt it
You thought you was flippin but got K.O'd
Ring-a-ling-a-ling get that ass up outta there
The undisputed thugs in harmony proved it
Kicked a couple of niggas asses
Gotta take off and stay still blastin
Locked in the state penatentiary but dog that ain't shit
Better make your money baby and pick up a couple of guns on the side

Come find em, pick up a pole and flip on all yall
And I’ll never hold up
Especially when I’m rosed out
Better bring your click
Them guns run, roll out or get blown out

So nigga respect this

But then if you wants to cause it
A 9 milimeter, sawed-off, a .380 tech nine comin out of me closet

Live in the Land of the brave, craze, dazed
Gotta blaze the maze and never did phase bone
My thugster brothers ruggish never did take no loss and

Senseless killers, Sawed-off haulin off the best of niggas

Oh well, if ya snooze ya loose (ya loose)
Stop bringin' that pistol and fetch ya and shoot it

To disaster, wish I asked him
And I popped up and capped him
And Eazy is where we began
But I blessed him in the master plan
Niggas thuggin' off in the Clair
Still depend
Can't fuck with these Cleveland Clair playas
So as long as ya betta be workin'
'Cause the Bone and Mo' Thug on this mission
Listen, betta pray everyday
Cross us on the way ho

Ohhhh, oh, oh
I just wanna separate from the precious, baby
Or maybe
I was meant to live my life caught up in this world of games
In God's name I pray
The devil, he be bringin' me down
I can feel him cause he pullin' me now
I've been blessed wit' an incredible style
When there's pushin, it's just try to separate and to break this all down
Now ain't that foul?
So I ask the Lord to help me
""Lord, why does this life overwhelm me?""
When we livin' in hell
But we chill most every day like we in heaven
Oh well
But time will tell
Singin', ""This is for the ringin' of the bell, the bell, the bell.""
But it be hard to maintain and stay peaceful
If you don't know to tame the devil then the devil will beat you
Defeat you, deceive you, evil
He will never leave you alone
I've been lookin for a better day
But they don't ever seem to want to come my way (No)
Hey, I've had a hell of a time
Tryin' to make it cause my people steady stressin' my mind
So I stay high
So I'm already sittin' on the top, ya see me
When he be wit' me
He's daily innovatin' me
Rarely see ya on the daily mission
Keep your distance from the flames
Maybe you can survive, forever and a day

Hell yeah
Got me flippin' in the North Coast
Remember me
The crook who wrote the book
I'm off da hook
Most of y'all niggas betta take another look
Cause if ya playa hate the Bone then yo' life'll get took
So quit, never bringin' ya no bullshit man
Face to face it's that assassin gang
Bringin' the heat, what y'all niggas bringin' is lame
But if ya wanna bring the pain, then ya gotta maintain
Comin' in on another level
I'ma put you on deck up at the top of the pile
Fake niggas wanna claim my style but I'ma break 'em on down
But you gotta come unique
It's the thuggish ruggish sound
That you're lookin for, or searchin for
Everybody boy wanna be like Bone and stay high
Little kids no longer wanna be like Mike

Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, window to throw it out of
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollas
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'mma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

Money money, the mighty dolla dolla
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on
I don't wanna be broke no more

You ain't worthy, none of you niggas could stop me
And none of you niggas could hurt me
If worse come to worse, I'mma get down and dirty

Thug style motherfucker, live forget ends
I'd never testify, Satan can't divide my piers
No weakness inside my fears
Drop tears, for niggas that died
I'm gonna safe divide, mind gone
And I think I'm running out of time
The god damn baby's daddy
And I'm gonna damned to hell, if I don't abide
And that's why I yell, B-E-N-Z we ride
Straight to the corner, down to the side
In the B-E-N-Z we
Roll around the corner with the F-O-R-T
S-C-V, and a nigga can't fuck with me
Not even the devil with B-O-N-E
T-H-U-G spell it motherfucker


Scandalous, straight up out of the hood type nigga
Stick up's, robberies, do we did gives a fuck nigga
See all ways to money so we mashing, we dashing
Get paid around parting give me twist a thug and I get up, in that ass
I'm here to get that money keep it coming, show me love
We made this, gotta get mine wanna slip, it's about mine
It's harder to get, I'm serious not playing that's the pay wits
The streets have come back, real fast on that ass feel me
Cause I don't wanna be broke no more
Standing in front of the liquor store with rocks no more
Cause my man, never had nothing to done that
It's like reversing time on my mind I can't go back, fuck that


I come up a nigga that never had nothin' but hard times
I was always grindin' and fuckin' around in the hood, into the bullshit
But I'm survivin'
I got to get me some money, mane, for the love of the cheddar
But, nigga, I rob your ass if I caught a nigga flossin' cash
What it was four niggas and we poor niggas but you know niggas got a scheme
To come up on green, nigga did it for everything, reached the scene, clean
And we was the niggas that stood on the block
With the color filled rocks to the Glocks when the cops came
Nobody have the nuts to say our name
They call me the Dummy Man
I'm sell him a fat twenty piece and then I reach for me pump (Pump, pump)
'Cause the fiends, they get awfully mad
When they see that punked 'em
Shook 'em, took 'em for they dollar, holla
Man, I ain't givin' a fuck, it's do or die
So get on the ground, lay it down
Give me some money, my nigga, pow
I ain't waitin', I need it now (Right now)
Ain't too much changed, I'm still on the grind in deuce double O deuce
I'm just a little more serious 'bout my reefer and my dough
Show me the money

Cause when they catch me without my heat, and I'm thuggin

To the pressure out of pressure, I'm loadin, blow you up
Y'all know we don't worship sin, it's tha heartz of men
And we'd tested stress, wanna be blessed consists of tha sin
In tha wayz of tha sin, to be dead. (Chorus)

Screamin' on ah my murda mo, bullets get niggas, let's begin
Ah new riot, hittin, and buckin them down to tha pave
Cause I'm in tha new sense of me grave
Couldn't you hataz, wouldn't be saved, hate 'em

And Benjamin Franklin pleaze come save me
Hit tha weed, and y'all in, rollin yo finga but spot ya

Kickin on somethig and dig this
Got to feel it catch and don't let go
Wretched in a fro
Bone watchin for the po,po
Roll over then pull it got my bullet in my fo,fo
I gotta stand it's turnin to a jungle (green bay)
Comin out a 4-door benz and I spend a lot for show
No no don't spend a lot contend with a men
Lookin at my watch lke a meal ticket
Arrest the block they couldn't pin it better send it
For the cops absorb you soul of course
Praise to the pharoah
Murder mo,curly I heard it lower and return it burn
When our niggas still shermed out
Court's adjourned!,court's adjouned!
Rest and burn!
(Layzie)
I can't sleep at night cause I lay in my bed
And I be tossin and turnin trying to avoid my dreams
And I can hear the niggas lettin off they lead around the corner
Got me feelin paranoia like they coming for me
And I be clutchin' my heat, got me pacing back and forth
So much shit on my mind, so many things to do
So little time a nigga really got to do it in
Man I be ready for war in my fatigues and boots
From the minute nigga step outside
Nina Ross on my hip and I got to pack one
Just like Little Eazy-E told you and me
Nigga never leave the house without packin a gun
And that's real leave it for the dollar bill
Niggas'll holler “Kill Kill” then start flexin
When the shit poppin' off in my direction
Nigga got a 17-shot for protection
Life ain't no joke
Too many niggas I know was takin' shit for granted and that's foul
Nigga if you see a fool, pick a fool right out the crowd
And hit him dead in his mouth for being loud and wild
Shit is real
Ain't none of that elastic faggot rubber band plastic shit
Muthafuckas in the battle zone blastin shit
Put the match on shit straight up gassin shit
(Krayzie)
Hell yeah! It's that same nigga runnin' with the AK-47
Bustin niggas in the belly
Give them muthafuckas more than just a headache
Get back at that nigga faster than FedEx
They're runnin retreatin screamin Mayday we're goin down
Now why the fuck is niggas tellin lies and rumors?
Talkin about we split up
Cause I see Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Niggas really need to shut that shit up
If a muthafucka really want to rumble we can tumble
We wilder than any animal that's in the jungle
The name of the game is block the basket, strike him out
Hit the goal make the quarterback fumble strategize
Any nigga hatin' ain't a friend of mine
Nigga considered the enemy niggas that's when you die
I never keep my enemies close
Cause I got a perfect view of 'em in my scope
That's close enough
Leather Face'll fuck a nigga up and smile
And hit 'em with the millimeter
And I show a bitch kill a nigga see me drivin
Bitch come on and try to rob me
I'm willing to bet that 'cha get lit up
Get off of me baby (baby)
Keep on comin' and there's gon' be drama (drama)
Tellin you niggas you better not fuck with me
Cause I ain't that quiet nigga that I used to be
Look how the haters give a nigga attitude
Nigga sick of being humble now I'm like fuck that I gotta get mine
They try to show a nigga love, but fuck that it ain't no love
Cause in the game you get fucked every time
Got this feeling inside my bloodline
Somebody finna get fucked up! If a nigga don't get some satisfaction
Blastin' like a madman
Gettin' with the static nigga lovin the action
Yeah My Bone Thug niggas come on
If any one of you niggas got any problems
Thinkin' you tough and you really want to solve 'em
Don't be mumblin speak a little louder
While you steady talkin' like you liver than the next nigga
We'll already be up in you now hater feel us
Who the realest The Bone Thug killas
If there's any objections niggas deal with 'em
Realer than them other muthafuckas talkin' about they thugs
Jumpin all on the bandwagon
Wanna be like us, wanna cuss, wanna bust they guns
Thugged out with they pants saggin they actin'
But when it's really time to show some tactics
The niggas don't have 'em
We murdered the bastards, puttin em all in bodybags and caskets
Drop 'em in the river, splash that's that ass
Cause when we clash ain't no comin back
Huntin' niggas from the past
We gon' settle this shit right here
Fight to whoever blood be spilled first
Who will be the nigga ridin' away in a Hearse?
Not me I'm determined to wake up and still be livin' in the morning you
Feeling me
Quicker than a clocked damn missle
Hit a bitch directly in the middle, right between your eye
Then we makin' sure that nigga die

Baby girl, me and you need to rendezvous
Cancun next week, how that sound to you?
I've been meaning to spend a little time witchu
I can tell you fed up from all of the promises I've been making lately
And I had to deliver but I been so caught in my hustle, tryna make this payment
And I shoulda considered your feelings
I shoulda been better about it
I shoulda been grown, not childish
I shoulda been way more polished
But my hustle done paid off, and I'm ready to spoil you..love
Come look, what cha boy gon do? (gone do), let me make this up to you (to you)

Weezy girl, I can't believe what you sayin'
You know you got it, should meet with my fans
But every time I get a break I'm layin
Where? in your arms all night and day playin'
You won't some time, I send you jacob, want sunshine then take a vacation
We ain't gon make it if you keep complainin, everybody go through changes
Love is a dangerous (thing)
(why?) it's full of happy and sad faces
Break it up to make up later, talk it out so it ain't no anger
We need more communication, you should have some consideration
Cause you knew from the day we met
What, what type of player you was dealing wit. haha


Uh huh, uh huh, wish! give her a lil bit

Everything I do, just for me and you, stack a little paper so its never rainy days
I got you, but just for me then you got to, understand that I hustle, hustle
Diamonds things, I gotta hustle, hustle, anything that brings the weight up
See a real thug too its in his nature, its in his nature
Not tryna say that you about that paper, but me and you, yes we like that paper

Cause we'll come to kill ya, now
We'll kill ya, now

Aw, triple-platinum, nigga, did that
And still thuggin' with the roughest muthafuckas
In my city, and a nigga wonder, ""How they still chillin' like that?
Ain't you scared of a nigga that's tryin' to jack ya paper, snatch ya?""
No, I really wish a nigga would try to take what's mine
Cause I got an AK-47 shootin' trey-O times
You didn't think I'm one to follow what they say
""Oh, my!"" but check it out, though
I done made enough money to buy me up a lot of weapons, y'all
And I meant to tell ya, I'm a weed head, stay high, nigga
So paranoia is a factor when a nigga wanna act up
Nigga figure I'm quiet, then he look at my size
Then they figure they gon try me
Like a muthafucka won't swang back or somethin'
Or even pull a nine out my jacket, and start dumpin'
Fuck 'em, I think a nigga see us on the video and playa hate
And say that we ain't true to what we say
But then again, when you see us on the street and playa hate
We bang them fuckin' brains (we bang them brains)
But then, we switch subject
And fuck with them clones that suck the thug dick
Run around foul, tellin' people we stole your style
Muthafucka, we ain't never been in your town
It's all original when it's comin' from the Cleveland criminals
So here we go, got a gun - should I buck 'em on down?
Or should I kill 'em when I put the instrumental on?
Why they wanna sound like Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish and Flesh?
I'm so full anguish
Gotta style so cold everybody and their mama wanna claim it
But they can't get the hang of it
Yeah

Better not be so quick test us
(May they lay, they lay, may they lay, may they lay, may they lay)
Cause we'll come to kill ya, now
We'll kill ya, now

Beat 'er up and you'll sleep when I step so stone-cold
I chalk 'em, coffin off and they frontin' that time
That they shot a nigga straight to the temple
Done a little bit simpler to me and all bodies start steadily fillin'
Get real high, steady droppin' the time on 'em, time from time and again
Here to pick all that know with the Bone it's a party everyday
So say, ""Mo,"" and it's still this strong to brain
I hop on the phone with the homies to see what's happenin' in the hood
It's all good. Niggas, they thug us, smuggle
Roll so deep in they own cut, but they gon' sacks sellin' for life
If you pull a shyste off to the fiends
Then gank 'em and leave 'em hangin' for the sake of come up
Yeah, takin' ends, and we'll split ya, lost it in the stick up, yeah
We better shank 'em, thank 'em, fuck it, I thank 'em, and hope for respect
Cause shit, he got sacrificed, my snatchin' a life in the midst of the dark
And I sped off with the quickness, strikin'
Send a knife to the back of a playa hater, hate a thug
And they thought that I bruise easily
Come, they go through this little, (spin 'em)
Most of what goes around, comes around
Ooh, bla-bla-bloody mess even though hoes really wanna test us
To the chest, Flesh buck buck, haters guess with a gun
They change in a whole new muthafuckin' attitude

Better not be so quick test us
(May they lay, they lay, may they lay, may they lay, may they lay)
Cause we'll come to kill ya, now
We'll kill ya, now

Nigga, let me in
Double Glock and never about to change, man
To the temple I aim and claim to gain control
Fin to rid your soul, creep or roll
Put some pressure on these hoes that, yo
They pose as foes, gotta let 'em know
Got a nation of my niggas out to back me
Got another nation--killas out to try to jack me
Exactly, what the fuck you thought you was gon' pull?
Fool, try to jack a St. Clair true, you lose, you lose
Nigga, I'm a tell you 'bout these haters distraction
They down with the puffin', the passin', 1ookin' for some action
Facts and stacks, never will my mission collapse
If you really want a thug, then you better pin these raps
And a I'm a give a little game in this world that we livin' in it
Sinnin' in it, and it really ain't free to me
You get it how you take it, but the only way you'll make it
Givin' peace to the G-O-D, your Lord
And it really don't mean that evil's gonna quit
Because the hater's gonna hate, and then the real - it's gon' feel
But I bet that after all of y'all fall
That the faker's gonna perish in the fire
Dip, and you know when I'm rollin'
I'm equipped with the Ruger on my hip with the infrared beam
And I gladly put it on ya from the land of California
Leavin' all of y'all goners, if you know what I mean
Yeah, so quick to test us, jump off in the Lexus with K.B
We gonna take a little journey around the world and see what we see
Any y'all niggas comin' with me? So, come on

Let me up in here and kill 'em
Feel 'em niggas wanna bite the Bone, bite the Bone
Didn't a muthafucka say I'm wrong?
Well I get down for mine, for my nine and blow
We shoot 'em up, buck
Yeah, strange we erupt on playa hation
Anybody hatin'? Erase 'em
And biters, everytime I see you on T.V
It makes me feel good
Cause I know when we run up on you
You'll see we, we gotta get paid good
Nigga, don't shit come for free in this land of poverty
Bone in harmony, we hungry
Since it's all about money, give Bone a little bit of that evil money
Don't gather the fly shit, fuckin' with Cleve, top of line in my Benz
Should I 1et 'em spin on all of y'all
Should let my 20s spin on all y'all haters?
Everything we write, I swear, it's all original
Niggas mad at Bone because we be all original (all original)

Better not be so quick test us
(May they lay, they lay, may they lay, may they lay, may they lay)
Cause we'll come to kill ya, now
We'll kill ya, now",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-all-original-lyrics

U Ain’t Bone,The Art of War,1997.0,"I'm sending a message to warn you imposters
All hating in my business
When I see you I'm a drop you
Get slugged and get drugged
My niggas I'll hustle to pay the judge
Got you 
when I spot you I should pop you
Even the boss was telling me not to
But I won't stop until they get shot
When they get out the hospital
They gonna get shot, too
The fast one bringing that AK
Better walk, then we even
When I leave and flees to Cleveland
Now, murder 'em and rest in peace
So goodbye, we're shutting it down
And now we're prowling niggas from alleys
Cloning our sound, we found your town
Now is you ready for the war?
Cry loud and go
Many if all niggas 'll fall off in they sleep
And even oppose and order them hoes
Gonna flee with me?
Bitch, fuck with me then see that
My little aliens, yeah
We come to your city, can they really
Put it on down with the pistol?
Can you feel me, feel me?

They beat biters, dope-style takers
When I see you face-to-face
My nigga, I'm a treat you like a hater
You niggas ain't Bone, you clone
You wrong, what the fuck?
You niggas ain't thinking, what's the consequence?
Now I'm 'bout to get
Real deadly, ready for the war when we just start bombin' shit
Trying to cop my click? Hell no! Real raw
Y'all niggas thought this was a game?
Now it's time to make you feel the pain
Wanna test my everyday thang?
I aim straight for your temple
It's really that simple when I seen it splatter
Had I even killed one of you clones
Then the rest of y'all wouldn't even matter
Scattered, run for the border, your career is getting shorter
Nigga, better hide cause I already warned ya
Mo Thug Records taking over, I told ya, soldier man your post
Better cover your coast and lock all entries
If one of my sounds is off in your town
Then it's going down by the means infantry
Instantly, finna be World War 3
If you fuckin' with my family jewels, you fools!
You niggas break golden rules, gotta walk the walk in your own shoes
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, them niggas going platinum every time
I'm ready to ride, you ready to ride?
It's 
do or die
, then, nigga, I die
I jump in my Five Double-O
If you got it, better flaunt it
I'm a drop the top, and lock the locks
And cock the Glock; it'll make you want it
Come get it, and while you're rappin'
On your song, just remember no pretenders
Bitch, you hoes ain't Bone!

I hope you realize that you ain't Bone
You ain't Bone
Why don't you realize that you ain't Bone?
Nigga, you ain't Bone, Bone

Straight from the corner and I'm a thug
All my diamonds, I bet you wanted to stop my shining
Didn't we warn you, nigga?
The sign, see? Blinded, run but they findin'
Me in my Double-big-Five-O, and critical with a pistol
With pistols. Feel that the verbal 'll
Serve you, heard my words are satanic and wishful
Then see you all get pissed off, my generals need no horse
We need AR-15s, twenty Glocks
With beams, and TNT
Nigga roll with me
Burial,  fuck the world!
When I deal, hope I repented
'Cause if the world I resented
It just might catch me up in heaven
But I'ma work this earth til it hurts
Gotta done make the worse
All the way through trial
I'm back in the court for some dirt
Get 'em off soil, they wait for alarm
I curse that silly ass bitch said I stoled a purse
And at them bullshit awards, but they told me
I stole beneath of my shirt, and it makes me sick
Even Ripsta's sistas, plus family understands
Fuck with it, put it on your Grammy
Even my mammy's scared to tell, and
Deep in my mind, devil seeped in, scary
Stay wary and carry on, promise to burn me
Never bury and hurry if you ain't Bone

These niggas wanna erase me, 'cause they can't face me
Crash collide with the niggas that hate me
Fuckin' with the real, y'all see how the fake be
Duckin' the cut, trying to look for safety
Make me reach for my pistol and pop it
Niggas gon' pay on the day that I spot him
Toss him in the trunk of the Caddy
On the way to the rodeo, killing all carbon copies
I'll be damned if I let a nigga breathe, indeed
I grieve for the war, what's next?
It's all about respect, bitch nigga
I'ma get that shit if I don't get nothing else
To the end I'm steady flippin'
Fuckin' the world 'til they give Bone props
Nigga, you got knocked on blocks
With rocks, beat down by the cops
And it still don't stop, Glock Glock
I'm grindin', steadily climbin'
To the top of the charts, where you wanna be?
Off in my prime it's all about timin'
As I look at my shit make history
No mystery, mistook and, nigga
That eight-time platinum real
How do you feel to the thugs appeal?
Make nigga wanna sound like Bone for a record deal
Should'a kept it real and quit frontin', nigga
Go round-for-round with the best
Nigga, step up and meet your death
Fucking with Kray, Little Lay, Biz, Wish, and Flesh
Yeah, it's all about survival of the fittest and it's on
Nigga, realize, or you die

Bone Thugs got a story that's similar to Mike Jones, you can ask my homies
I remember back in the days when they didn't want me
Now, I blew up, they all on me, they smiles phony
It's hard to determine who really is wit'chu
These niggas is fake
They tryin to eat out of yo' plate and you can't get a break
Now how much can you take, for heaven's sakes
I can't wait, they got me listenin'

""Listen to the wind blow""

Sittin' back, blowin' on my indo
Rollin' with my middle finger hangin' out the window, let's roll
Get your motherfuckin' hand out my pocket
Now you wanna be a nigga friend, like we partners
Nigga, we was lookin' for a deal and you dodged us
Never did call us, what was yo' problem?
But now we ridin' by
(
""Listen to the wind blow""

Niggas tell the real from the fake when it comes from the streets
Live in peace like a beat, like a drum from the ghetto (Ghetto)
Give us our peace, won't let it go (Let it go)
Said we wouldn't make it, now we some of the greatest
Bumpin' through yo' trunks and yo' radio, radio!

I'm takin drastic shots 'til these bastards stop
When the casket drop, I'll be mashin out
In a brand new drop-top Fire, nigga
Listenin' to the wind

Killin a nigga with an automatic weapon
When they step up they get hit up with a AK-47
Everybody's tryin to get a nigga with a blessin
They better not mess with mine cause I'm tellin
All you niggas from the beginnin, that it ain't no pretendin
Conversate you gon' get in

Nigga, you better learn some'n (Some'n), we got the hood hot locked
Even got the 'burbs bumpin'—everybody tryin' to get in

The early bird get the worm, took the game by the throat
And squeezed, 'til the motherfucker broke
Believe, it's murder we wrote
It's dope that we serve from the curb to the booth
These niggas gon' feel it cause we spit the truth
Ain't never no fakin, that Grammy the proof
Haters just hatin we do what we do (
""And if—""

Let 'em talk 'til they blue in the face
Only because we blew up in they face
If Bone was hurtin', if that was the case
I'd probably go loco and catch me a case
Nigga, just move, and give me some space
When I let the wind blow in my face
Nigga don't quit till I finish the race
Number one in the place, better make no mistakes

It's Leatherface in the place, about to hit ya in ya bankroll!
All the niggas that was poppin before started to rock it
We got this, now try to stop it if ya ain't hoes!
Wouldn't ya know, this the coldest flow, and have them feelin it all over the world
They see the Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone!
Me and my niggas is thorough-bred and every time we pull up in the party we twirl in

So, you know we packin heaters from the door
Fo-Fo, all I really need to guard my body
And plus I'm with some niggas all kind of psychotic...

You niggas is fucked, yeah! That's what ya gonna do?
When ya run up, ya done up, them busta niggas fools
And we don't play, catch a feelin, bring it yo way!
We them thugs, niggas really buzzed, nigga all day!
If we have to, yeah, think about the time
When a nigga disrespect mine, where I'm from, then I got to shoot!

Hustlin right here, them thugsta niggas right here!

And I'm sendin my shouts out, and fuck you to the haters
Who deny? In 1994 we switched the game up
With the homies with the rappin and the flow that always change up
Playin lames in the games, what a shame, had to hang up
They music careers, cause my clique brought the bangers
These niggas wanna ride on a coat-tail
They stay on the dick, because we servin 'em so swell
I remember when motherfuckers called it bitin
They used to do that, cause these niggas couldn't write it
All I'm tryna say is, give a nigga credit
If a nigga can't get it, then a nigga gettin deaded
It's all about respect, remember Layzie Bone said it
Better believe I'ma get mine, I'm dyin as a legend
I'm livin as a legend, if I want it I'ma get it

Black nigga killa
Hate brought death around the block
As the hollow points bust through the punk's back
Raising cain feel no pain as I penetrate
Nigga five deep as I strike at a quick pace
I got the evil of my dead nigga trapped in my mind
So my soul is a threat to all mankind
Born to kill, I'm wicked by nature
Cause the streets of my neighborhood breed young hellraisers
A 30-yard .6 with the scope
I make a skinhead brain bust all across the West Coast
Motherfuckers catchin heat, as I bring anger
And release more danger, from my chamber
The evil in my blood is possessed
So I creep low from the back slow
And push lead through that nigga's flesh
Ain't no hope, when every nigga wants to be the nine-milla
On the trigger, the black nigga killa

We be the mighty warrior, black nigga killa
What's up? You ready to die?
You think you can fuck with them Thug niggas?
C'mon tell me the truth, nigga look in my eyes
Bitch we get live, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony nigga
Cleveland's thuggish ruggish niggas still down with the thug shit
Buck buck bust, let 'em know we still run this bitch
Just like an assassin, say nigga we nice but can get nasty
Get into war, what else can it be?
Nigga you know what we came here for
You know when we shot through the door
My niggas was serious, playin no jokes
Just cause I'm a rapper you thought it's for show?
Okay nigga let's see if this a real fo'-fo'
You thought we was studio, saw us on video
Seen us in person so here we go (here we go)
What is your problem? Here come the bullets
Better dodge 'em, I sneaks up we lodge 'em
Fuckin with killas, nigga don't make me kill ya
Got a bodybag for any you bitches thinkin you real thugs

Say we some killers fo' sho' (sho')
Hit 'em up, hit 'em hard if you ready to roll
Niggas out tryin to fuck with us
But I'm givin you one warnin, that's a no-no
Cause I got what you need, if you are ready
To die, to die, to die, nigga bye-bye
Shots might be fired, yep, everybody gon' run
Naw, shootin at me, better hit me or one day
Fire! Here I come, come
And you don't wanna see we, like that (that)
Cause everybody pack guns, but Bone go pap pap (pap pap)
Really just out for the money y'all
Really won't hurt none of y'all
But playas went too far so I say fuck y'all
Fuck y'all, y'all, y'all haters
All y'all, y'all, y'all haters

Black nigga, killa killa killa killa

I'm servin these bitches daily
I'm a black nigga killa, that's what you can label me
Unfadable, see? You don't really wanna fuck with us
You can't touch us, you ain't able
Rest in peace, Flesh creep and sneak with a streetsweeper
Niggas don't ever know what hit 'em
I split 'em and snatch they soul like the Reaper
Have you ever seen a killer dressed in a trench coat
Sold over a hundred pounds?
Rollin, downin a fifth of Rose when I stroll
And who wanna fuck with me now?
Lay 'em all down, when I creep through your town
And clown I bet you feel ah
This nigga behind the trigger, clack back
Stack, that black nigga killa

Cause dyin be easy...
Nigga you know what Bone be sayin
Rollin with big guns, ain't no playin
Stayin down for the murda mo, slayin
Aw shit, just to let you know
Man that 187 for realer, we black nigga killas
And down to ride for E (E)
He'd a ride for me and that's the way it's gon' be
N.W.A. nigga B-O-N-E
All around the world, most dangerous groups, marchin like troops
Lace your boots, be ready to shoot
Cause if you ain't then a bullet might hit you
Picture yourself in a coffin
So stiff and cold, full of formaldehyde
Better scatter, dodge 'fore this bullet lodged in yo' ass
Simply for the cash
Been around the world, seen so many faces and so many places
Aced this game while they try to erase this
Daily basis, gimme my space, shit
Show me some love though
Just pump your fist in the air and holler ""Mo!""
Could you do me that? And I'll hit you back
Little nigga just wanna know where my thugs at
Some at the track on the back
Oh yes, some niggas on corner 'round sellin that crack
Some of my thugs in the grave long gone
Lot of my niggas at home playin Bone
Could they rest in peace? My niggas sleep
Makaveli, Biggie Smalls and Eazy-E
T-Rock got shot, T-Rock got shot
Lord bless his city, bless his city
That's why I shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
I shoot, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, always
Nigga, always - that's why I shoot 'em up",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-bnk-lyrics

Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang

Now why did they kill him
It's one of my niggas is dreamin' schemin on making a million
Tryin' feed they children and police keep coming around
And keep tryin' to beat you down, and take you out
Nigga don't worry God don't like evil
Shit is so clear that they can't even see through
But no matter what we do (matter what we do)
We gon' be strugglin' forever running forever
The way that I see it won't get no better
Until armageddon goes down it's not a legend
It's kinda hard to view, paradise
But if you just try close your eyes you can view it
But reality hits you soon as you open your eyes you find
That you still live a fucked up life
And the streets done took over your mind
Figure you gotta survive, so somebody got to die
You just wanna break down and cry
But asking God to come help us please, why?

So don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang

Some ah y'all niggas really can't fight
Betta get it together, betta act right
Cause when you fuck wid Bone
Betta come wid somethin', betta have yo shit right
And don't be planning no feud on nuthin' you heard, nigga
He say she say get you fucked up killa
And I'm gon' ride, won't lose no sleep over nuthin'
You can save the frontin'
But all these years, face to face, ain't nobody said nuthin'
Livin' in these wicked days
Tryin' to get over my wicked ways
Time after time I know we tried
But losing this life game, damn
I don't wanna go out like that - not me
Lately Bone got what you want
Physically you don't wanna bleed
A la la la la la la
Hit 'em hard it's gonna be alright
Alright alright

So don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang

And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
Wid all odds, against us
When the guard got me running for the fences
Aiming at these henchmen litigate shells
I'm teaming my clip wid the extra extension
I sit in my basment like it's a crackhouse, bored
Blackout cause I was paranoid, he enjoys what I avoid
The courts ah bowl ah, crooks
Cause bitches won't put money on yo books
Destroy double eyed dotted watch devil smiles wid a cush
Gotta sell chronic to get me up some mellofied timing televised
The crucified promised in ah my ish nobody can stop us
Where the shoot out?
How many niggas you killed?
How many niggas for real?
Like Mary Louelle as long as I live
Forty five strategized like,Ohh dow
Niggas can blast at me
Bitches can pass me
Fuck ah chicken and let's get on

So don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang, a damn thang

I remember like yesterday, way back in the day coming up
Moms used to read to me everyday, through the evening
Even through the afternoon and at dawn ah book of songs
So I'm wondering off through the wilderness
Somewhere in the valley of the shadow of death
Want to hunt me down all the need for people
Heaven I wonder will the devil catch me shall prevail
Lately even heaven is flashy sick of this amazed envy
And it ain't nuthin' to see and believe in heaven in front of you
That's what I'm having a de ja vu
Lord when I lay down down to sleep
I pray for the Lord and the Holy Ghost bless my soul to keep
And if I should die before I wake up, wake up, wake up ,wake up
I pray for the Lord to have mercy on our souls oh please Lord take us
I say to my momma peep no no more crying drying eyes
Nigga locked up at wayside
Couldn't even pay respect to my stepdad when he died
So finally got a release bid and I slide back to the county
Back to the 5-5 ride fore I touch back home
Don't worry bout a damn thang
Everything finna be al-right
Off to the door so bright like a knight in shining armour
Hug my wife my sons my daughter
Ain't no more reason to even bother

Say don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang

Look nigga I ain't worried bout nothing
Cause it's a little thing I know called faith
All you need is much as a mustard seed
And the Lord will keep you safe
Whateva don't kill you will make you stronger
I promise you that just keep on pushing
If you slip you fall and you hurt yourself
Then the Lord will provide your cushion
Determination, rules the nation whateva you facing just be a man
Believing in death before dishonor shake the drama and take a stand
For ah nigga like me see it didn't come easy
Ah nigga had to struggle and fight
At ah point and time in my life
It's like ah nigga just can't get it right
To all of my family Layzie loves ya
And I never take shit for granted
Feeling so wicked off in this planet
Man fuck tryin' to understand it
That's why I stay focused thugging and loc'dus
Stacking my bricks till I form the fifth
Momma never said it'd be like this
But nigga I'm ready for anything
Remember to never count your eggs before they hatch
About precision timing and vision
Get up and go and don't turn back
If you ah soldier and you know it hold ya head up high
And keep stompin' in yo big black boots and don't worry

Say don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-dont-worry-lyrics

Cock my nine, and I'm out the window
Drunk as fuck and high off that indo
Nigga E, C-P-T, the O.G
And I really don't think u wanna fuck with me
Nigga walkin half up with nine in hand
I gives a mad fuck but they don't understand
I wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Now back to the mutha fuckin set, creepin crawlin crawlin creepin
Don't get caught sleepin

Sleepwalkin stalkin runnin with the guage up under this murderous spell now
Consider me hellbound
, crossin my path, I'mma drop this 12-guage shell down
On the road to destruction, guage eruption, creepin so I'm cautious
Catch a nigga sleep, six feet deep
And scopin out peepin cause ya be makin me nauseous
Deeper than a ocean man, hitttin you with this potion man
Death runnin up from the left, Bang! #1 in this murder game, insane
See a nigga fall victim, pick him, me click him, hunt on this deadly prowl
Watch out for the nightfall,when them come, mo murder be a nigga style
Mo murder, me comin to serve ya
Judgement day, me reapin
Lil Lay on the deep end
So me flipped with a spiff and I caught them sleepin
Eternally soldiers of the Clair, keep it ruthless, Mo Thugs
Little Layzie ya big boss, wanna floss on this
Gotta make that cheese, yeah nigga we gettin 'em

 Nigga let's killa killa killa
Bodies they count, me buckin em down, stay down
Murder me style,

Steady flip when I bang, bang, man
Flippin I roll with me gun
Still it's itchin to bang, bang, hang
And it's all the same
They willin to serve ya mo murder, mo murder
They thinkin you tangle but when they get mangled
Rip all of your soldiers scream, but no body heard ya
Then pop in the clip if ya lettin me doze off, you lost
Creepin, I'm drunk when I stalk me victim
Sleepwalk with the intent to kill him
Woke up and my shovel done soaked in blood, put em in the mud
Dont know what it was but his gut was still drippin off me fuckin gloves
Then I got me strapped up, straight-jacked up, but man i'll be reapin
Creepin up under your dome, it's seepin
When the sawed off get to creepin,fall victim

Me stalkin, chalkin up bloody victims
Rest, the Ripsta, the sinister kill a nigga
Put him in a river, bodies shiver, pump blood now
Wanna rest with the Mo Thugs, buckin em on down
What is it in ya, deep in the dead and we get fried
P.O.D. d when it comes to ride
Creep out your seat, but dont fall in the night
Once inside, forgettin about remorse
Tour curse'll ride, cry now when I'm ready to lie down
Then I awake in a mental state somebody gotta die now
I'll pap pap puttin a clack back in a me gat
Not never to mention never to mention
It'll be over when I take a nap, me deadly
But then me put in the bullet, the wickedness in me
And I'm on a mission on murder roll city to city without no pity
Well I got a clique see
My niggas up out of the woods reapin
Peep me creepin out of the corner, who just got caught sleepin?

Once the Mo comes up thers gonna be murder
Killer when the night falls
And it ain't shit to kill cuz I really don't love ya
Don't run, run, run, I like my knife
Run up with that gun, gun, gun, and take your life
Straight-jakket is loose creepin up to get ya get ya
But fo' mo killas #1, Leatherface,that psycho and that killa Ripsta
Dippin me clip and me dumpin, me ditch ya
Thought he was dead but they saved him with stitches

Can’t Give it Up,BTNHRESURRECTION,2000.0,"There's always something you got to give up (Yeah, I know)
If you want everything you want (But shit I don't know, I don't know)
There's always something you got to give up (Yeah, I know)

My life is a jungle, I struggle hustle Monday through Sunday
They tell me the world is mine but shit I don't want it, who want it?
How could it be mine and I'm still hungry, still hungry
Lost and lonely - so I holler at the voices of the wind as a friend
But I predicted this endin, back in the day
Cuz I had visions of bad decisions knew niggas would go astray
Although we pray and we pray and we pray
We do but still will a nigga lose?
No more united, divided we fall, nigga and hard
We all dealt fucked up cards but don't complain;
Just play the hand that you was dealt
You play 'em right you prevail - you play 'em wrong then you fail
It ain't hard to tell, when you been headed for self destruction
Cause I, could look at the piece of the puzzle
It ain't no love involved - everything we was dissolved
We all hard as one, but together we raw
And there ain't a nigga that can fuck wit that
We supposed to be been tighter, my nigga wassup wit that
Lettin the devil get in, should’ve pinned
He was pretending to be friends
We was taken by that snake in the grass
Slither slick, the nigga fast
Yeah, that motherfuckin snake in the grass
We dropped our guards and he got inside us like a virus
Now our family reunion done turned into a family crisis

There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..
There's always something you got to give up..
If you want everything you want..

I was never on some solo shit
Always down to roll and blow a head off
He dead off and don't know me, don't tell me you love me
When I was lonely and my daddy died
All of my niggas came to get dressed
And thanks for comin, I'm still stressed out over the death
When I take my breath and puff my cigarette
I think the world is just collapsin
But I'm still rappin get it all off my chest
So I came back to the action
When the bird was flyin, low, and laughin
Family bashin 'til it just happened
Then Wally passed - and he asked me, ""Wasn't it tragic?""
Louie askin me if he'll ever come back so hard
We tell the truth, no use in beatin around the bush
Baby I'm sorry.. it's alllll in the game
Throwin up blood - fuck it Layz'
Let's sign our life awayyy

Now see me? I ain't givin up a motherfuckin thang
It's hard to come by - and I ain't no bitch nigga
Shit been in some robberies and walkbys
And you don't want that; neither do I
But I will, I will - cause I'm a hustler, hustler
High 'til I die, I'm gon' get mine
Even if it mean murder, gettin caught, fuck it let me fry
Know it's hectic, niggas start shit nowadays..
But I'm a hustler just like you, don't bring that shit my way

Well if there's somethin you can't give up (would ya give it up)
To get everything you want (I can feel the love)
Well if there's somethin you can't give up (would ya give it up)
To get everything you want (I can feel the love)
Well if there's somethin you can't give up (would ya give it up)
To get everything you want (I can feel the love)

Hell naw I'll be thugged out nigga, turned out nigga
Runnin wit niggas thats killas;
The realest that be shermed out nigga
Spittin my prophecy ain't no stoppin me
I'm comin through with the motherfuckin shotty
I really don't wanna hurt nobody; just kill off Illuminati
Fuck the D-E-A and the F-B-I
I-R-S can kiss my ass, U-C-P-D, F-C-C
Y'all better quit too 'fore a nigga come blast you
Blast you - ""Hit 'Em Up"" like 'Pac did
Take 'em hostage, terrorize and torture
Your ghetto resource'll be pay back, pay back
Little Lay dat, young nigga with scrilla
And bitch I thought you knew
You got a beam on me? I got a beam on you
You fuck wit me? I'mma fuck wit you
Beeitch! Like it always be
Y'all bitches gon' have to kill me, feel me!
You gon' have to pop me, to even try to stop me from grindin
I'm leavin you blinded by the size of Mo Thugs 'til you find us
All the nigga know what the hood like
In the streets gotta get that good life
Sellin that yea up under the street light
It's the hood life, don't fight
A nigga want out but just can't get out;
So I guess I gots to face it
All them dreams of havin big thangs, I'm still gon' chase it

It's always somethin' you got to give up (Yeah, I know)

Here they come, wait can I barktalk Bone, jumpin it feelin
Better now, better hit 'em with the future shot
But feelin like Pac, that's what the guy thought
But this shit don't stop, I send much love to the pop
Droppin this shit today, we kickin this thug music
Better love us, so when I love smokin buds on the bus
See we gone sells out that'll make you lust
My nigga don't play too close, my thugs in heaven and shit
My niggas'll pop with the pistols, and snap out the holsters
And cover a snitch all wet
Why the fuck could not he write me S-E-T for the second sincerely
We baggin 'em up rollin niggas and throwin 'em in the wasteland
Soldier, told ya nigga we gone have our time
Like daughters in heaven don't tell him, on his knee
He's fell, he better hope he don't fall victim
Niggas pick up another, then they run
But I'm through with the body bitch ah
But when they want it, yea he just in the business
Flesh givin you pain or pleasure, whatever you want I'mma bring
Young, but them package you'll be impressed

MARIAH CAREY featuring Bone thugs-n-harmony

Layzie:
Over, over. Don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over. Don't break down yet, it's over
Over, over
Krazie:
Steady breakin' me on down
Mariah:
Oooh
Krazie:
Break, breakdown. Steady breakin' me on down
Break, breakdown. Steady breakin' me on down
Mariah:
You called yesterday to basically say that you care for me, but that you're
Just not in love
Immediately, I pretended to be feeling similarly, and led you to believe I was
O.K. to just walk away from the one thing that's unyeilding and sacred to me
Mariah:
Well, I guess I'm trying to be, nonchalant about it, and I'm going to extremes
To prove I'm fine without you, but in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the disguise of a smile. Gradually, I'm dying inside. Friends ask me
How I feel, and I lie convincingly, 'cause I don't want to reveal the fact that
I'm suffering, so I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night, and turn down all
The lights, and then I break down and cry
Mariah:
So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to suddenly just stops loving
You? And it seems they haven't got a clue of the pain that rejection is putting
You through. Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I will survive?"" [Krayzie:
Gotta get control and roll, roll, roll on.] Do you lash out and say, ""How dare
You leave this way?"" Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?
Mariah:
Well, I guess I'm trying to be, nonchalant [Krazie: Break, breakdown. Steady
Breakin' me on down.] about it, and I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine
Without you, but in reality I'm slowly losing my mind underneath the disguise of a
Smile. Gradually, I'm dying inside. Friends ask me how I feel, and I lie
Convincingly, 'cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering, so I
Wear my disguise 'til I go home at night, and turn down all the lights, and
Then I break down and cry
Wish:
Gonna break ya down, down, down, only if ya let it . Everyday
Crazy situations rockin' my mind tryin' to break me down, but I won't let it
Forget it. If ya feel the same way that I do, then let me help y'all, all
Singin' tunes, sayin' ""It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, yeah.""
Hopin' for the sun, but it looks like rain, P.O.D'ed, but it's still the same
Came far, but it's been a long road. Trouble's gonna come but we gotta stay
Strong. Hold on
Krayzie:
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all, but nevertheless Krayzie won't
Fall. It's over. It's endin' here . I said it's over. It's endin' here
, so I'll be on my way, and maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailin', bailin'. Bailin', baby, gotta get up, can't take no
More. I'm headed for the door, come and take a look into a thug humble eye
Tell me: if we lived a lie, would our souls unite?
Layzie:
Every new day is a test for me, so I just pray the Lord for Him to bless me
Please. There's struggles I'm goin' through lately, breaks me down, set me
Free. Let me be. Let me be. Who else do I have to rely on? Whose shoulder can a
Thug go cry on? Can I get my vibe on? While you look into my eyes, you won't
Underestimate, and this soldier story, I'm'a tell you right now I'm fed up
Wrong if I let my lead bust? Pac said keep your head up. Don't let this world
Get the best of you, I'm a stress you through it, if it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over
Mariah:
Well, I guess I'm trying to be, nonchalant about it, and I'm going to extremes

In a mask at my home with no men in a mansion to get a little piece of this American dream
I spit venom thru the pipes as I smoke in em

It smell good and the weed still sell good for the lay bits
Talkin bad like you ready to blaze nigga you ain't mad

Enlighten us the righteous one
I am waiting for the righteous one
Enlighten us the righteous one
Are you waiting for the righteous one?
With the faith of titans with your beauty enlighten us

Mama said it's a cruel world
And I still can't believe some of them things that I've seen with my own eyes
Weak niggas frontin like the strong guys fuckin with them Bone guys
Nigga you die,you die
I'm that sneaky little nigga still off the hook
Off the chain and a muthafucking wire
You can label me a hitman that's out here for hire
Throwin up blood til the world expires
Nigga's lost and it turned out
Ain't got no direction and don't know which way to go
Nigga save your soul cause we all gotta struggle or strive
And that's called survival
It's vital nigga better know what to die for
Living in the battlefield it's all about respect and honor
Niggas be strapped with the gats and armor
Ready for whatever nigga fuck the drama bitch what?
We can make a mil take a mil tell me how that paper feel
Is he real is he real?
Would it make a nigga kill for the house on the hill?
Drive a brand new Benz and no bills?
Fuckin right it will that's why I stay heated
Cause I got to let'em know a nigga's needed
Nigga fuckin with me while I'm weeded
Comin with the beef then nigga you eat it,eat it,eat it!

I am waiting for the righteous one
Enlighten us the righteous one
Are you waiting for the righteous one?
With the faith of titans with your beauty enlighten us

And you're feeling so thuggish outta Columbus
Seen my mama? Hey, remember me baby?
I bought a Mercedes, a crib for my babies
And lately got him running from Lady Death, still I'm shady
Okay they say he schizophrenic and crazy
Back in the 80's tryna get up out the foster homes in dreams a teen
And now my mama lets me down
She wouldn't pick up the phone
I'll make it all on my own
But that's a whole other song and y'all don't leave it alone!
I save then baby, c'mon!
Murderous, somebody noticed when I strike through the killing fields, dead!
T-Rock done got shot got a Glock for the nigga ar-tillery shop
Drop when the nigga pop and the party dont stop till they call the cops!
Somebody get with the bacardi, got to get to the block
You know it's me and my niggas, all the guerillas, killas
Still I'm puttin Biblical bop
Stay in rhythm with my eye on the clock and tick-tock!

I am waiting for the righteous one
Enlighten us the righteous one
I am waiting for the righteous one

We got Mack-11's AK-47's
Yellin mo murda with the beam got lots of felons
Bloody bodies smellin
Caught up in a 180 ah got grenades and cannons involved
When I'm barkin just fuck with the 5th Dawg
Nigga we got a missle to haul off the shotty guns
And a barreled sawed-off
And all the body bags come with the white chalk
Nigga while you on a mission my nigga better protect the chest
A super nigga bullet-proof vest nigga take it from me Flesh
You don't wanna be sorry yet again
We don't need another nigga-less army
Sow my destiny with artillery quality satisfactory guaranteed
I ain't no con I'm a nigga that's waiting for some shit like Nam
To pop off in my country!

When Kennedy was shot on the drive, the roof went on fire
Hide all, you little children in a dire
When I spark in the dark with a lighter
Light up and don't die in silence
Somebody was sitting on the backs of the lions
Somebody was drinking from the back of the lamb
Somebody was spittin' ammunition in the radio-even in Zion (Zion)
Millennium and also through the city when they hated
Don't be bucking on my Bone
When someone's home and never play to me
And pray to me, can't play with me
So label me a runaway slave
And ""Cést la vie""!
Murda Mo criminal's insane
Isn't worried about the aliens
Move faster and then ask 'em about the state of men and help the matter
Brace yourself, I can't tell if I'm in peril
I ain't well, fucking up some, suck it up,Son
How will he run from jail?
When the jail's within himself

Nigga get ready for the big payback
Been thuggin and keepin it gully since way back
Lot of niggas been talkin, they runnin they mouths barkin
Runnin around false, they claimin they wanna run with the rawest
My record is flawless, my method is lawless
I'm a automatic weapon nigga you just a target
The number one artist from the +Land of Tha Heartless+
Fin' to get ya, hit ya nigga they couldn't call it
One nigga left and they talkin 'bout we ain't happenin
So we had to give that up and make 'em recognize platinum
Look at everybody rappin just like I'm rappin
Niggas gotta admit it that Bone Thugs is the master
They die... and there's no competition (no competition)
Tear the roof off the motherfucker
I put a boot off in a motherfucker's ass, still down to blast
Or clash with any one of you niggas who start
We ain't trippin off of none of you niggas (whoo)
Leatherface the boy is back
With a little bit of action bring it, rap it, sing it
Bust it, whatever dawg
Whatever y'all wanna do I'm with it, wicked (wicked)


Mmmmmm I done had a mil', took a mil', blew a mil'
Still in the streets, that's how I live (I live)
It don't mean a damn thing
Still got a little change, believe me comin in (in)
Shit I pass a nigga, seen a lot of niggas point him out
Point him out, ""That's him here""
It's about to be easy with a big cast eat him up, send him on his way
Kick him in his ass, have a nice DAY
Went the wrong way, got a lot to say
It can get so murderous, murderous
Touchin us never that, Bone Thugs still the crack
Crack and I can't lay back on the comeback
Spit on these niggas, spit on these niggas
Round up any of you niggas, any of you niggas
Won't be no recognizin niggas
Just one warnin impatient, one time only okay?
Don't repeat myself, bad for my health
Don't wanna do that, rather spray
Catch me on the wrong day, catch me on the wrong day
Better stay out my way, better stay out my face
That's the last thing you wanna do, Thugs true
Sing the blues, I shoot at you now you move


Y'all know how I feel about fake niggas
Bitch niggas, snitch niggas, ain't no love for them
Put a nigga in his place, momma cryin at the wake
That's right, that's what a nigga does for them
I play above the rim (I play above the rim)
With no lames in my circle cause I love to win
With the real ass niggas with the Thug in them
And if you talk too much I put a slug in them
Oh no, don't play with him Lay, gon' get him
If Wish don't get him then Kray gon' get him
Straight up, we spit 'em
With a 9 on my side and I slide to the rhythm
Let me slow it down
In case you didn't catch my drift
Lift a nigga up out his shoes
Trigger finger not hesitant
Fuck it... let me speed it up
Hit him like the ammunition comin from my heater
Y'all niggas can't see these Thugs
Seventeen shots from the 9-millimeter
On the creep with the night vision
Infrared beams pointed at your dome
Can't wait to see a nigga response

Even if I'm under surveillance, I watch out
Wanna win, and fuck 'em up daily, throwin' up 7
What am I yellin'? Murderer
Nigga, once you come you must pay like crazy if you
(Muthafucka, don't play me) play me
Nigga, not today
I see you but you can't see me
I know with all of government and
Yes, this will get crazy and blow (bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb)

Got your mind blown, vocal tones keep it sewn
Blastin' out your steroes or your headphones
The roots exploited clones; therefore
It's my job to describe the loudness, the habitat of rap survival kit
Artistic skin abrasion, so when 'em fadin' my worldly reflections
It's magnified to new levels of elevation

And flippin' on police, yeah they know me
I'm not lonely, only, show me when the smoke clears
And at least I had my homie and a nigga, K, homie
All bitches, look into it as you want the real killa?
Well, pull out your pistol, bitch, and shoot it, shoot it
And you knew it, do it, when, when you looked in my eyes
I'm ready to die
And I hope my mama really loves me
Cause daddy's bye-bye
Inner pride with the Ripsta
Let 'em hit ya with the scripture
Picture me locked out and smoked out with a half of fifth of

Three sixty-five, I revolve around trees
They'll be Japanese Maje$ty's corruptin' record companies
Nigga, jump for cheese, catch sub-zero freeze
And crack once the atmosphere brings the temperature back
Slacks only in dress pants
Have you ever danced with the devil in pale moonlight?
I have, Hollywood niggas make me laugh
Sell a dream to 'em
Cash, no royality, grab they royal keys and dash
My overhead projects how ends meet to foul or ejected
Lyrics was selected beyond my control, last door on the totem pole
Pockets swoll from tape residue, last interview and went in daytime
It's made a promise to let down smooth criminals gently in my business
Grab your earlobe and bend, this is big business, buy tapes
Don't lend, niggas mad while I scrap change for phillies, why grill me?
Got bigger balls to chase waterfalls with Chili
Explore on four wheels or foot, I bring it to that ass over the hook
So when you slip, gots it. I ride up on it
I had to maintain my mental frame, and now I'm Boneless
Word sound 'til I'm foamin'
Cybergenics wanted my genes for clonin'
Disownin' heads like Romans fight rebel Trojans
More than civil suits make my longevity boost, articles
And promotions make me more potent
Deadly to the mind, 'causin' somethin' to be blind
Re-define lines entertwined with all mankind
Would that rain outshine divine Maje$ty, shame
The boogie down punks is where the hearts still remain

I'm a let a nigga know
You know what I'm sayin', just right off the bat
I gives a fuck about no nigga
Don't be no (corvie) - ass nigga
I'm tryin' to tell niggas that off the rip
Off the rippa, baby (I must me losin' my mind)

Where's tha mob?
Find your specialty, let's give this nigga a job
Is you ready for jail?
Yes and no, but somebody's gonna try to rob
We can spar, but you'll get drop (drop)
I'm a bomb, ready for war, will I p-pop pop
Been looking for miles, been doomed since the womb
When he put me in my tomb
I've been thuggin' so assume when I entered your room, boom
Stomped through Compton and cities y'all ain't never heard of
And listen I bet there's thousand people screamin' I'll murder, murder it
Hypnotized, took off my shirt, I got alive
I'm tatted so when I die you can see what's deep in my eyes
Trues ride but trues die, my nigga, don't cry
I shedded my last tear when I found out love was a lie
So I try, but it ain't nothin' for my mental
So piss off my pencil, and I blast, dash in a rental
One nigga got amped and off he in the trap with some
They took a chance and lost
Let's spray everybody and gangsta gone
Don't finish the wars when they ain't over
I love you thugs, but all them skeletons got so close
And they got so hard if it ain't starved

In Decatur, all around the devil block, trouble knocks
I'm ready for 'em, niggas they know I'm ready for them
I'm a artist, I'm a deadly poet so I'm heated heavy for it

Meet me in the club, all my niggas get to whoopin ass

Never back down now that the Bone Thugs back {*blaow*}

These niggas is actin and puttin on a fashion show
We done checked these niggas
Met these niggas, man I don't respect these niggas
I'm a real motherfuckin T-H-U-G original
Hate to be a critic but yo' shit I ain't feelin though
You niggas is elementary, I got history
Lyrically you can't see me, physically I'll bring you misery
Seriously, you niggas ain't been hearin me - but listen
To these other niggas hits, you hear my twist, they do my shit
But it's all good cause we keep it all hood
And when we see niggas we roll dawg like a hog should
Just let me put the motherfuckin money on the wood
Bitch niggas would be Bone if they could
But I'mma shut 'em down, I'mma shut 'em down
I'mma shut 'em down, Bone niggas known not to fuck around

Chasin paper always (always) and I know how to get it
In pissy hallways (hallways) in a raw way
You could get it how you live, nigga step the wrong way
I let it bang b-bang bang, I'm the streets for real
And I love it but you know how the gameplay got me ready to kill
Somebody, but it's all good
With these shows in my streets, nigga all good
Gotta keep stackin my paper like it's all I know

Well, fuck that freebie shit;
You ain't got no money  you broke bitch!
The Bone works hard to get brewed all day
And we don't give a fuck about what sober niggas say
I stumbled into the house and people ask why
I dip the joint into the brew, so I can get high
My nigga Krayzie Bone hooked me with that bomb bud
Now roll me up a huddah, I'm about to hit the bud
Cuz, you know a friend with weed is a friend indeed
But a friend without a doubt is the one that bless da 40 ounce

Straight from the muthafuckin thieve land
Where you cop a 40 (you want a 40?)
Ounce for a dollar ninety, even
And drink a brew, I'll be a true nut and a alcoholic
You gotta problem, I gotta problem
But my brew will solve it
Don't try to stop me; I get drunk than a skunk
Cause I be rollin with the brew in the trunk

We gotta get even
Even if it means I got to stop a muthafucka from breathin
And I'm waitin' for niggas to plot to rob me
Nigga that can explain the reason you fucked up, bleedin
Never forgot about guns, never forgot how to load em
Never forgot how to shoot em
Always a thug nigga what?
Fuck it, let's shoot up the club
If any of you niggas get pumped
Thinkin' you thug and you jump, nigga, you goin' get stomped
And we goin' shut this whole thang down
Going out with a big bang, pow!
And that's how the thugs do it
You know we get down and dirty
Nigga, you know the story, don’t make me, boil me
Let’s get ready for war
Last year we was humble, nigga, this year we heartless
So, any nigga that want static
Come meet us outside in the Yard, bitch!

It’s a hell of a job, when you marry the mob
I put a ring on my finger and say goodbye to my kids
Never ever will I be a legal citizen collectin’ my dividends til the law
Ends, flossin
Rollin in my Benz I go against the grain
See, we ain’t go change
I take an eye for a eye
Either thug or you die, and I ain’t goin cry
Rock a bye bye, nigga, die-die
Got a grudge against the judge
Tryin’ to lock up my thugs
Wanna see us fall short
Fuck it, I’ma blow up the court and show ‘em no remorse
Hit ‘em up with the C4, backdoor
Nigga, let Stack go
I’ma attack with rap and show the crooked ass law no love
Better let dogs loose
Got him, hold him up
And on top of that, these niggas fuckin' with cuz
All the real niggas in the streets with heat
If you really got beef, then buck it, fuck it
Nigga get disgusted, commit that 187 in public
If you runnin’ for your life
In hot pursuit and you got to shoot to stay free, scream
Murda on the government, take me

Muthafuckas out callin’ my name, but I’ma keep it the same
Figured I changed, nigga, fuck the fame
It ain’t no mystery about mine
Same little nigga from the double nine
Everytime, I keeps it real with shit you can feel, still to the Glock Glock

Aw yeah, I’ma hit 'em with the murda mo
See ‘em, better let it go
Bet they gon’ run, run. Nine millimeter plus
I got a nigga beat or when it ain’t enough
I got my shotgun
Now, how many niggas wanna roll with me?
Y’all say you real, then we’ll see
Will you ride for me?
Will you die for me?
If I pop somebody, straight up lie for me?
There he go, now slowly approach
Start buckin' but baby, no kills
Hit him low, we gotta get money so fuck it
Just show him what’s real
Cause it's all about money, money, yeah
Don’t get in my way
Fuckin’ with my money
Cause that could surely get you killed
Better find somebody to play with ‘cause I really ain’t out to play bitch
Serious ‘bout mine ‘cause you’re runnin’ out of time
And talkin’ that shit'll get you touched, bitch
Now you know that we ain’t into that rappin back and forth on no song
Shit, like we ain’t got nothin’ else to talk about but you on that ho shit

So crazy, interrogation
So many haters aggravate, so I convey and toss grenades
You niggas wanna be the T H U G?
Please, like me but can’t see me
Bend and roll like a fuckin hog
Muthafuck, 5th Dawg is definitely too damned greedy, sleazy
So many hoes screamin, bitch, skeeze me
Tease my nuts, get up on the thug stroll darlin
Stack my dollars up to the ceiling
Nigga, with a mob and creepin through the neighborhood robbin damn
It’s a man on the roof with a gun, better run
It’s your chance
Runnin through servin a dum dum to you
I'm a unique Bone Thug man
Stop wonderin' why did he leave that bloody, dead body gone
The nigga thought he could fuck with mine
But you’ll never find no others more like my kind
You heard my niggas willin’ to get down and dirty

See the villian trudgin, nigga, peelin slugs!
A muthafucka here to show you who the realest thugs and that’s us

I, promise that I'll hunt you bastards
Zip 'em in casket, here to get drastic, fast in a hurry
Is you ready for me magic?
Let 'em blast, and nigga, better burn
Then move, true to the murder mo, gladly
'Cause the haters never had to have me
Want to follow fools through alleys
'Cause ready to lose and daddy
Who raised me like Layzie, Krayzie
Probably St. Clair babies, so hate me
But I handle my business
So lately I can handle my shady
Kill 'em, but we think I'ma bomb again
No leavin' as they put me in prison and give me time
I'm ready for the gun to go get'em
And I'm a fill 'em with eleven of mine and one die
Is he ready to lie if I decide
Lookin' at my killings in his eyes and boom to go bye
I'm gonna fly (fly)
Whom die they lie

Whom die they lie
No mo' mercy...

Whom die they lie (Shot)
Now, who wanna go snitch?
Talk shit about real trues, still be payin' dues
Saw them sneakin'
And a nigga gettin' sick of all the playas, they hatin'
Why so many fakers runnin' they mouth about shit and they lose
Lookin' so deep eyes, and tell it when they lyin'
Stop tryin', but they never convince none
Got hundreds runnin' up with gauges
Still I'm sure they sure they fryin' us, but I buck
Sometimes I save it, for me kill 'em off late at night
So, what if it got too late for me to get 'em?
Then gotta switch to testin' G's
In this game I aim to keep away from every crazy steady
We're too quick to pull petty bullshit
Y'all thought that you could fuck with the Cleveland thugstas
#1 fillin' his gun, and I wish you would
Bitch, pop, pop and pump and have to show you through
When Mo' thugs comin' in, it's a headline
Time to get on top of moff top
When they got on stages all over this nation
World, and I plan on
Now look at you bustas get mad
Beat the fuckas on their own line
Don't make 'em tell it to ya twice
When you crack a grip, keep it real
But you should die, pay the price top
Whom die they lie

Whom die they lie
No mo' mercy...

Whom die they lie (Shot)
Time to stick it for the thugsta, thugsta
Little sneaky muthafucka on a mission
Grind, be plottin' for it quickly
Who fried? Do or die, nigga
You and I for the creep on the come up
And pay these niggas a visit
So is it, was it, wicked ways
Got me strugglin' for days
Hey, a nigga's gotta eat, so yo
I gotta get paid and blaze
So swift not to catch a case
Crept up in his place
While the nigga was gone for his safe
And his stones, and it's on
Cause the Bones havin' a say
I won't forget this evenin'
Nigga had thief, Little Layzie Bone
Thievin', cause he had cameras hid off into his ceiling
Pin me, niggas run away
They said they lookin' for me
But I'm a find a nigga killin' before this nigga find me
Y'all niggas know a murder-bound city
See me when I'm servin' now, parlay it down
Breakin' it down in the C-Town
Spot 'em on the avenue, follow him passin' through
Get 'em at the next red light, green light
Got the go ahead, infrared on your forehead
Whom die they lie

Whom die they lie
No mo' mercy...
Whom die they lie (Shot)

I'm that nigga with the shot and, red-hand
Answerin' niggas, poppin' enemy
Drop 'em
Me gotta get 'em
Kill 'em before they get the coppers on us
And you know the bitches want us
But as soon as they close, it's the pap pap, pardon me
Take a look, and what you see;
Krayzie still runnin' from the police
'Cause I got a fuckin' bag of weed
I'll be leavin' sale now on the scene
I can do it, I can kill 'em if he gotta be a casualty
He after me, but I'm a put a bullet through your head
Shoulda fled, but you didn't, so bye-bye
Take 'em a couple a days to get your body outta the sea
Meet your fuckin' fate and in grave lay
St. Clair, Wasteland, all my niggas comin'
Oh but they can't take it, if you wanna make it
Break 'em, hey, or can't a nigga get paid
Or your fuckin' with some niggas in some desperate days
Crime, yes, it pays, if it's cool with it, cool with it
Never act a fool with it, broad, cause your losin' me
Tell a muthafuckin' nigga, cause a nigga told another nigga

Use it smoothly don't abuse it do we?
Oh, so lovely

Oh so, don't you know that I know you're whole M.O
And away you go and I got (...?...) mo, little bit
You know so, hit it, me stumble (...?...) and even scuffle

But when kept on disrespectin'

And the shit don't stop, yeah
'Til the casket drops, yeah
I'm all that I got, got, got

Once upon a time there was a little young nigga runnin wild and smokin weed
And if you was lookin for whatever, he can get you what you need
Down Thuggsta with some problems, nobody never seem to spot him
One day somebody shot him, and the drama got started
Now his momma's on the pipe and bigger brother's in jail
Nigga go on and cop a seat, I got a story to tell
See, first he was just chillin then his belly got hungry
Everybody in the family out for self, ain't got no money
So what's a young thug to do now? (and do now)
Ain't nothin to do but hit the streets
And get some heat and put the rules down
That's what he get, lil' hustler off to the races
Tryin to win it while he in it, actin bad and catchin cases
Before he knew it he was in too deep
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, he was in too deep
He coulda, changed his life, but no he didn't
Now the little nigga layin dead in the grave still not listenin

'Fore the liquor store close in a rush turn it up
Let it drop, now nigga let's roll (roll)

Anything that bang or that roll up

Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

Everybody’s gone crazy, amamzed that it ain’t the same
Their faith has swayed! Everything done got a little bit stranger
Major complications plague the days
Everybody caught up in the fame and bright lights
While so many gonna swing in the night life
Stabbin’ ourselves with so many pains!
Life’s like really leavin’ me plain as I fight to try to make it out of satan’s
System
But really all they gotta do is shape the world
Make the world realize we must escape this world!
Hopin’ I can get up outta here with my integrity and come up on a better
Me and try to do it big
Do it big and through it to the heavenly
Won’t be no hell for me, just paradise (dise, dise ahh!, ahh!)
So what you gonna do, what you gonna do?(do, do, heee heee!)
When the new world order come for you. (for you, for you, ahh!, ahh!)
All you can do, what you can do is recognize the truth!
Realize these signs could pertain to you too! (too, too)

Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

It’s just for comfortability!
It’s killin’ me floatin’ rock already we damage the ozone
Ain’t nothin’ been hot as the sun since steady b flex his authority!
And what may be important to me, electricity’s older than trees
And that’s why the lighting be crackin’ the sky
Precious the metal was meltin’, but what about me?
When it comes to the mind, core, and the animals stick with us
B go with fire, entangle the body, the brain, and security, visual forces are
Not with us, why?
And the timing is dire! (ahh oohh)
Oh, I’m rich I feel so elated it’s time to go. I love you baby
Before and after I’ll remain to the day with a theory, from here to lake
Erie
You know that the devil’s a liar!
The choir, I sit on my phone, all alone with my baby just singin’ my melody
Raisin’ a son. I never get tired, I’m too rugged for (Ahh, Ooohh)
I couldn’t retire! Another dimension. Releasin’ my tension
They’re payin’ attention, they’re walkin’ so blind. Oracles, snakes…

Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

Signs keep showin’, goin’ on
Can’t believe how my mind has blown
I witness mostly wickedness
How much more mischief can go wrong?
Steady holdin’ on down to slow it down, tryin’ to make it to a better place
With the enemies up, they stay wide awake and everybody else caught up
In the rat race
Watch how they done trap you. Don’t let ‘em catch you
Wipe away your whole existence
It’s not easy to resist temptation or escape all the resentment. So much
Tension
Seem like I’m havin’ a nightmare that’s reoccurin’. The vision is blurry, the
Curtain is closin’ in a hurry, that’s something worthy of worry
Dig deep and researchers, their story is full of dissention and
Transgression!
Now we gotta find a way to reserve this recession
What have we done? Lord what have we done (done)?
Look what we’ve done! Look what we’ve become!
Lord what have we become? (come)

Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)

Richest country in the whole wide world
Then why do got hungry little boys, little girls? (Ahhh Ooohh) spent
In one man lies their dreams. Come clean, just come clean
Mothers, fathers, sons, and daughter, it all adds up to their selfish greed!
They’re greedy, greedy, greedy, greedy, they greedy!
How about one laugh for every lie, twice for the unnecessary lives. But
Since they cowards give ‘em that firing squad, get ‘em outta here quickly
Quickly! Violence must be met with violence, be we be the one’s settin’ off
The riot. Oh no, no, look what we done, done! I’m a voice of power! (power)
I must protect my ghetto son! (baby!)
Without him there’s no blacks tomorrow
We all (Ahh,Oohh), so stop the violence and watch how you change the world (the
Whole wide world)
(I know) it’s clear, won’t get outta there
If you really want change, take a look at the man in the mirror (mirror), in
Your mirror

Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we've done! (look what we've done, done, done)
What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

Ain’t got no apology for the economy
Logically thinkin everybody gotta eat
Blame the economists, all of their promises
Not bein’ honest, why would they lie to me?
I’ma be clea, what I see is fear!
They set up the satellites, labeled us televised!
Population in check, people petrified!
Cnn on deck ‘til they testify
Invadin’ these countries for natural resources
They wipe up the forests to get the oil in the industry, although they
Claim to be loyal
Through all of the turmoil, their families get spoiled
And I mean! Heee Heee! Can we just go green to kill the pollution?
We need a solution, the future dependin’ on it!
You know what I mean? If you don’t put the endin’ on it
Armageddon gonna come real soon maybe then you want it
Landlords put their tenants on it! U.s
Congress put the senate on it any moment!
I want an atonement without secret service bein’ nervous political warfare
Ghetto came out of nowhere
Let the last be first, it hurt, don’t go there!

Aaaahhh! (pray, pray, and we pray, pray, pray)
Ooohhh! (and we pray, pray, pray) whoooo!

What have we done to the world? (to the world, world, world)
Look what we’ve done! (lord, what have we done, done, done?)

(ahh, ahh!) so what you gonna do
What you gonna do? (do, heee heee!)

Fall short to the crome
Gift wrap that bitch ass on
Much love for the green leaves
But me trues have to ease me down
Puff puff head rush
Popin in me clip and I got plenty rounds
Me no pretenda
No studio thugsta
Wanna get wit'cha
And if me miss ya
Straight #1 and the Rispsta
Swang watch 'em hit cha
So we can swang (we can swang)
Down foe my thang (down foe my thang)
Finna blow to tha brain
Thought you could hang
When I swang them thangs
That's insane!
Stay low (stay low)
Dem popo know me no surrender
Dem niggas on the street they remember Bone as being no pretenda
Standin up on the block
9mm cocked in me hand
And me got my niggas lookin out for me back

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)

Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
But muthafucka makin' as I ain't the one
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and end up thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and a pager
Searchin my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every thug nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished
They will bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if their're fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam you down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
But Krayzie Bone will swarm
On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the C-L-E
Them punk muthafuckas be afraid of me
Uh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' around my way
Yo bitch I got somethin to say
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

Fuck the police and Bone said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, and is with whenever I'm steppin'
Then the muthafuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Bone was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
The police, I'm sayin': ""Fuck you punk!""
Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
And we'll go at it punk and I'mma fuck you up
Make you think I'mma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
And I'mma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
And any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a helluva scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The muthafuckin' killer that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'mma turn it around
Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound
BOOM BOOM - yeah, somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the strap
Takin' out a police, will make my day
And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

(You muthafuckin' right)...

I'm tired of this muthafuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my thug while I be thuggin' in the shack and
Shinin' them lights in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much, but
I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an A.K
Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity along with my group cause it's violence
It's the Bone with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a thugster nigga
But still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A nigga in a uniform waitin' to get shot by me
Or one of my niggas
And with a gat it don't matter if you're smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool)
And as you all know Layzie Bone came to rule
Whenever I'm rollin' keep 'em lookin' in your mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb muthafucka with a gun
And when I'm rollin' off the 8, you'll be the one
That I take out, and then I get away
And while I'm drivin' off laughin' this is what I'll say
Believe that
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!

Still don't give a fuck about the law
Still run with a pump in my car
And fuck who you are
You're fucking with a couple of niggas that's really insane
I'm talking loco, crazy as hell
It ain't just a name
It's the game
And we done loosened up a couple strings
And shook a couple of screws loose in my brain
Besides that, ain't nothin' changed
Look at me now I'm still a thug
Nigga I still smoke bud
You know I still represent St. Clair wig split shit, nigga what?
This is Bone Thugs niggas
Thinkin I told you but we put it down like that
And whoever we got to fuck up to prove that we do it
And keep on movin, guess who's back up in the house?
Original Cleveland Criminals
Niggas just send em subliminal messages like ""murda, mo murder murder""
Never forgot where we come from

And smash and crash
Protect my niggas for combat
Leathaface at ya and on your ass like I was a heat seeker
Quickly the reaper peep you
Sweep you off your feet in Cleveland

But nigga you fuck with me then I'm a fuck with you
Introduce you to this heat
I sweep the street
When I draw down, let me hear you say ""fuck the law now""
Rawest niggas in the town
Ready to thug and go down
Go pound for pound, nigga that's the motto
Let me see you throw them things and if it's real
Nigga keep it real
Show me your game
I'm sure gonna claim
What the fuck is mine
My nigga I'll take it
Grab a player hater by the neck, choke him out and try to break it
Gimme your money, drop them keys
It's a jack move bitch
And since you haters ain't got no business
That's how we attack your shit

And every bitch said I'm a good bitch
Fuckin with the wood grain
Everybody still playin that hood game quiet
Especially when it's tired
My environment ain't nothin but niggas dieing
In them chemical fed injections in Jasper Texas
Split up these niggas off in different sections
Don't hate my message
Destiny led to mimic
Chastity for my daughter
Wad up a niggas sherm
And come listen to the sermon
Swervin in my Surburban, lick it up with the bottle
But everybody know I got some problems
Had dreams of the Apollo
The fiends had faith in me, suckas wouldn't run
A nigga not insane
Niggas still with me
Bone, somehow they turn up
Run up and get your sign
Run blindly, elevate through time
Nowhere to hide

Our dawgs finna haul off lead
Sawed-off head
Nigga you drippin soakin with bloodly body be beggin me
You know what you should've capped like 2 pac with a Glock
They're deadly, better not upset my thug mentality sucker
You know you done fucked up
Don't you niggas?
Runnin up blastin gas craters
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky?
Could it be a bird or maybe it's even a plane

Then give them the buisness they gonna feel it when we jack
And be quick with it, be crack

Ballin' through the hood in a Murcielago

Get a little bit of Twista and hit that
Roll it up with some bone thug sit back
Just feel the vibe
And ya never let a player hater kill ya high
With this shit we be spittin' we gon' steal ya mind

You can tell by the way I walk, the way I flow from around here
Nigga Midwest where the weed ain't the best but we came up
Now we get flew from the West coast, (West coast baby)

The Ghetto would always gon' hold me down
Pickin' me up when I'm flat on the ground
Liftin' me up through the dirt that I found
Takin' me well beyond leaps and bounds
Sold to the , souls of the clown
Little window out in the park
It don't get no better when I get it in
Got any Henny for my kinfolk, some Indo
Dead in my tracks like Kimbo, slam back another six-four
Sip slow, got lifted, out on my mind, flippin', I'm fine
Back to that ghetto smhetto
Back to the basics, back to the missions
My niggas, no kiddin', I get on this plane and I'm goin' insane and I'm sharin' my rhythm
Been working on second winds
I'm second to none, seconds to win, seconds to run
First to lose it, worst to come
Sippin' on booze, forever young
That's real talk, come at you young
You can hear my real heart, it's real dark back where I'm from
That's cause they'll kill ya
Mamma told me get money, boy, don't be no dummy but she was so caught up I thought I was nothing
I'm probably something,  method is complex
It's ghetto, I'm ghetto
Fuck it, what, I'm ghetto
Buckets, what

I was conceived in the back seat of my Grand daddy's Caddy
Momma had me, she was 17 and my Pappy was a Marine
Big dreams livin' in the ghetto, brick cities, seven levels
Roses don't grow through concrete, streets loaded with heavy metal
Chase paper or chase the devil
We can dance up under the moonlight
We can all fight, fuck it, bars and stripes, red blue and white
Listen at the shit I say, 'bout to sway as I convey
Everyday it's payday no they ain't fuck around
My thugs persuade
These niggas you see me wit' bitch
We got way more to lose
They call me Sticky, got an itchy trigger finger niggas hog all your booze up
We can kick it like trues, man, get it in
Wit' a known motherfucker how to win
This is a trend, we said it again and again, I guess I'm going to win
I keep plenty of guns on deck, it's plenty niggas that's from my set
Sign a motherfucker's check you can't even cash, well, that's your ass fool
Bet, I'ma let it rest
7/11 I'm breaking the bank
Makin' it out the Ghetto I'm livin' swell now-swell now

I was born with a strike against me
Then they told me that life was empty
I don't like it but the fight is in me
Never ever would I give 'em my rights, don't tempt me
Move forward, tunnel vision
I channel my energy without a collision
They feelin' the synergy, all the decisions I'm makin' broadcasts like a television
It's all in the ether
It's either I make it or somebody dead
Cause I'm tired, I'm humble, no pride
I'm ready to ride, rebellin' 'cause Satan a lie
I'ma sit back, exhibit some patience for the Lord, no limits, no waitin'
All the boys, single women, and babies depart from the ghetto with Layzie
Too long we been dealin' wit' the stress and the pressure of workin' with lesser and less
I knew momma would struggle and no one would help her
The drama was too much to measure
Pleasure only came when we could make her smile
Treasure every day, I could make her proud
Better one day, wait, how 'bout now?
Together we pray, all out loud
I'm down, I'm not out
I found a way to get out
Said I couldn't do it put my mind to it
Look Stuart, we found a way out
Tryna come up, not to stay out
Really to bring back the love for the kids
Like look what I did, you can do this
You always can make it wherever you live

I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda
I need someone who'll do this  (Born in the Ghetto)
I was born in the Ghetto, raised in the Ghetto
Ain't nobody takin' that from me (Born in the Ghetto)
This time it's gonna get better, get better with this chedda

Order My Steps (Dear Lord),Strength & Loyalty,2007.0,"Jeremiah 10: 23,24
""We will know oh Lord that to Earthly men his way does not belong
It does not belong to man who must walk even to direct his step
Correct me oh Jehovah however with judgement not in anger
That you may not reduce us to nothing""

Order my steps, lead me, guide me
Everyday send your annointing father
I pray order my steps in the world

Why am I payin' this price for fame now with the shame
I'm goin' blame cause I'm solo empty
When I can stop and give it all to Christ
Cause in his name no weapon should be formed against me
Simply know that the world gon' tempt me Satan is the enemy
God please help us I don't want to be selfish
I don't want to live my life tryin' to be rebellious

Who be checkin' when ya know ya doin' wrong huh?
Got your steps, give your blessings
Know right from wrong turn the lights on
All ya gotta do is follow faith till they call us all home
But its so hard temptation is everywhere
Gotta hold my guard like oh my God

Halleujah, Halleujah, now I might not make it to Heaven
But I'm tryin' to come back in the resurrection change my place in paradise
So I pray to God try to change my life
But temptation make it hard for me to make it out
Man I gotta cool out
, still I need to stop smokin'
I need God's guidance without it I'm hopeless
Lord please help me stand strong


A lot of soldiers in the pin ain't ever comin' home
Can you find it in your heart to pray
So it seems everything goin' wrong
And you're just tryin' to find your way
Momma just wanna feed her babies
Tryin' to keep a safe place to stay
Don't stress it's a test God BLESS all ya
Really gotta do is just keep your faith

You can feel it if you open up, you can get it if you need love
As much as a mustard seed is all you need
Small person pays for the air that we breathe
And the baby is born, place to go when we leave
Food that we eat, weapon when we sleep
It's a miracle no believin' the Lord

HEY!
What cha seein' on the news has already been written in the Bible
But ain't nobody takin' the time to realize that believin' and readin'
The scriptures could mean your survival and I don't wanna die no neva
I wanna live forever and I would a lot better
So when Armageddon really come true what chu gon' do?

 swing low  God loves me
 swing low  ask me how I know
 swing low  God loves me, ask me how I know
 swing low  God loves me, ask me how I know
 swing low, swing low I know cause the Bible tells me so

You know God is good
You know God is great and everyday I wake
I gotta thank him for my life and even though its hard
I know I make mistakes I give it everything it takes just to make it right
This is Satan's land understand the plan yall Jesus
Comin back with a furious mind better praise everyday

My Life,Uni5: The World’s Enemy,2010.0,"Hard times, got my mind in a bind
I'll go crazy, tryin to climb out the grime
That's in my life, I'm surprised I've survived
It's amazin, I'm alive, I got by with my life

Every time I look around it seem like I'm in trouble
Pressure by the double, Lord I love you
And I really trust you, wish that I could hug you
Disappear from the grain and the rubble
And I'm tryin to keep from goin under
We ride Eastside, blowin in the wind
Each time I try, they lie, no lie
Judgin from the outside lookin in
Never had a clue of what I really do
The ghetto pushin through but I'ma do it right
Never buckle, never stop to struggle
Layzie got the muscle through the pressure bust pipes
My life, highlights, bright lights, alright
Story of a warrior, my flight
Final destination, thug motivation
Time never wastin, pacin my fight

Tryin to get it good, feel the hustle and flow
You know we are the mighty soldiers
Had it for the shit we been through
And doin whatever that God truly knows
So here we are steady on the go
It's too late cause we been through crazy
Every day seem to bring a twist
That take us on a loop but we don't let it phase
Raising these babies, do we ever run away
From responsibility but where you goin?
You're gonna have to face the music anyway
Livin through a true reality but you be blowin
If they test you make 'em feel the pressure
Let off some aggression
Yo the Flesh'll really give 'em somethin to stress
More likely even less

My life, lil' nigga bailin through the hood
Lookin crooked like I could
Get you for your goods, make it understood
Put it on the wood - nigga what?
I used to have to grind in the dough
I did a little time in the polk
A couple wicked rhymes that I wrote
Really helped a nigga shine with my folks
Cause nigga I was broke
But Eazy heard us go and Eazy said ""Whoa!
Y'all niggas dope, five niggas loc
Five killer flows, y'all fin' to blow""
So temptation made us sign the papers
Overnight sensation clearly chasin Satan
Niggas really famous, got a lot of haters
Callin us the greatest, #1 and can't nobody fade us
Got that top spot, done did it (done did it)
Came back fallin down, down

Bone, what happened?
What happened, why did Eazy die?
What's wrong with Bizzy, he alright?
Is Flesh, really comin home? Is Bizzy comin home?
Wish he'd the Henny to the dooooome
I'm so high, stay fadeeeeeeeeeed...
Might feel a little better but the pain stays there
It's okay the real gotta strive
Everywhere we go the hood life's alike
Cause they can relate to the fight
The real from the fake, sound good he's alive

As I wake up early in the mornin, light my cigarette up
Wake up both my bitches, take a shower quickly
Tell my Lord I love him dearly, fight the devil
Get him ahead and swiftly {*swish*}
I never ever thought I'd keep my candles lit up
Get 'em, hit 'em, get 'em, mm-mm I'm with Bizzy
Nobody knows my struggle nor my hustle
I'm a certified rider, gave up all my children
Women in my shit and dippin
Now you know the Lord is always with me, that's my only weapon
Talk to every sinner, bless 'em
Then I raise my 7 up and I don't give a fuck, get 'em
Television celebratin livin, get a ribbon
Every now and then I'm chillin

My family, oh, it means so much to me
Everywhere we go, playa haters gonna hate and that's for sure
My family tree recruited on this thugsta groove
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

I love my family
And this Mo Thug family, you mean the world to me
Heaven's where we gonna be
Together...

...Together we stand
Together we fall, ya'll
I never turn my back on y'all
I got my halo cocked, goin' out with y'all, ya'll

Come look at this world that's ever so cruel
But the good Lord blessed us
Gave me true family I can depend on
500 Benz with the Synchro rims on
Now I can get off when the wind blow
But I'd like to thank you, Jesus Christ
For givin' for givin' up Your life for us
Now, I can think twice, 'fore roll the dice
Advice from a thug, tell mommy I love her everyday, think of her
Take a look at your thugs to the front of the line
Hear the thunder grind off in my mind
We done partied overtime
Destruction, terror, oh what an era!
Let's get it together 'fore it's over
Be a soldier like my Mo Thug family

They never ever turned their backs on me (backs on me!)
When I was down (I was down!)
My Mo Thugs (Ohhhhh!) was always around
And if there comes a time to pick or choose (pick or choose)
My Mo Thugs won't never lose (Don't ya know your gonna lose!)
We are the thugs
Yeah, we be those children (Gotta be that child)
We gotta keep on thuggin', that's how we make our livin'
(Gotta make my money, man, it's still the same, yeah)

You know who I be, once again, comin' at you
It's Jhaz, megablast, top-class, black Jag, cream rag
Playa, better check your hand, look out for the New Breed

...Females comin' for you, Mo Thug family roots runs too deep
'Brina trippin' on these haters surroundin' us trues on a daily basis
Smiling faces, jealous of this Mo Thug flippin' on the risin' status

Yeah, yeah! My family, (It's my family, Mo Thug)
Yeah my family, Mo Thug
Tell me who the coldest (the coldest) playa you know?

Rollin' with Mo, rollin' with Mo (rollin'), you'll fall, gotta go
'Cause we survivin' these remainin' years
When the smoke clears, no fear
(No, no fear) No tears, no tears

When there's a problem I can't solve (I can't solve)
My family gets involved
We've been here through thick and thin
On my thugs I can depend

Been down from the getty-go, since any of yo'
Can you feel me though?
Mo Thug takin' over from the north to west
Wanna test?
Better come prepared with your Smith-n-Wess'
Now learn the lesson, stop stressin', be true to the game!
Mo Thug runnin' everythang, everythang, everythang

We want to thank you (we want to thank you!)

To listen to our funky groove
We are soldiers now (we are soldiers)
We want to thank you (yeah)
For the time you took to listen to our funky groove (soldiers now)

I guess if it was not for them blessings
Weak evil thought would control my whole existence
We preach and speak true belief from within
This family tree would fall, crumble like Sodom, Gomorrah

Can't duck, can't run from the cut
Back up!
The wasteland field, peel for mine
The deal, how the clique be real with it
My family tree standin' strong

Natural born in the world of madness, no gladness
Leave a nigga insane
Gotta change my way 'fore the darkest day
Clickin' tight 'til the end with the gang

Come on, come on and swing this way (swing this way)

Humbly united gatherin' souls understood

Hold on, I bet you we'll never go wrong if
We stay strong against the evil that be tryin' to split ya
He, who gets conflict, must just be weak
It's gettin' clearer and clearer, clearer
Enemies want to break my family down, pinnin' it
If we ever needed the Lord, we need Him now
Amen, Amen! Bless the Mo Thug children
And could you watch over mine for me?
Get up, get pumped, do what ya want just don't insult my game

Get up and get something

It's all about money ain't nobody frontin'
I gotta go get it we gotta survive
Whether it's workin' a nine-to-five
Or ridin' the hustle I gotta get mine, bottom line
Most of my time I'm out here puttin' in work
For all of my days that I run this earth
I'ma make it count for what it's worth
You never know about this life and the type of pain that it can bring
That's why you gotta get off of you're thing cuz it ain't no dream and it
Ain't no game
We so serious, dogg you know it don't stop
I know time is the devil's workshop

See I do it I did it
And y'all know that I'm wit it
I'll give anything for passin' and take to it back
A hustlin' little brother with crack
But now I grind a little bit harder
Harder my niggas stories in order
See, it was hard for me momma
My mother dropped in the water
My sister was damn fast, Heather was right behind ya
Cassie, that's my little sister
My father loved you like the only child
Funny, he ain't never seen my smile


You betta get on yo grind
You betta go get it if you really tryin' to shine
You betta be keepin' yo eyes on your prize at all times
Keepin' it real for my all of my thugs in the projects
The niggas that ain't got shit
Not havin' this nonsense my niggas
My momma said, boy if you ever wanna be anything
Get off the couch and out my house, use your brain
So I took heed and I jumped right up on my feet
Got off the streets and I'll be
In heat I'm laughing at police now

Coming to you like this
This used to be child
Is now a grown man
Don't play with the wrong hand
But I never could quit cuz I'm playin' a strong man
Everybody got a point to prove you might as well start today
Rather than puttin' it off tomorrow
You're lettin' it slip away
Lil' Lay, I parle
And get paid, and that's all
And I creep and I rise
In yo eyes I still ball
And stand tall with my chest
And my cheek to the sky
I'm in it to win it my nigga believe it until the day that I die
So come on


Anything you want, anything you need
You gotta get it, yeah and go get it
Ain't comin' to you, you gotta put in your dues
Show the world that you can do it
Don't let nobody hold you back
So you betta get your hustle on
Baby betta get your hustle on
You betta

We some of the livest, you know
True thugs don't really mind to riot, let it go
They sayin' get up and get it
Yes we went and did it
You won't admit it
Cuz you hatin' cuz you can't get it
Every since I was a young thug
Been creepin' showin' mo' love
Even when I got it you best to give it up

This is what we want with no chumps, please believe it

Mind of a souljah, mind of a souljah, release and feel me
Everybody by now should know my label, my thugsta
These things guidin' your struggles
All it is, is about this hustle, whatever it takes to piece this puzzle
Why declare war on these fakers and haters eliminate us, traitors ?
These are the days of our lives (lives)
Do or die, (that died to Boo - he go bye)
Whom die they lie
 in the face of our society
Try at of every attempt to quiet me
I got a nation that's down to ride with me
Here's the deal, can I get a witness?
It's deeper than survival
Who am I? My brother's keeper?
Yeah, I be clutchin' on my Bible, willing to die
The wicked is near me
Dearly departed, but nobody hears me
Is we all gon' fall in misery?
It's so serious, it bring tears to me
Ears to the street, like a drum to the beat, creepin' up my block
I'm already knowin' a nigga wanna do me
So I stay strapped (Don't pose for the cop)
Crooked cops, they gonna harass me
Ask me the same ol' bullshit questions
Knowin' I'm a thug with bud for days
Keepin' a pistol in my possession
But a thuggish ruggish soldier like myself gon' move on
And prevail, avoid jail, collect my mill with my Bones, splittin' domes
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, don't make me hurt ya
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, all about that bloody murder
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Seen it was hard tryin' to bring her sons up--they dwelled on the worse
And ate nothin' for done up, comin' up, made it, eternal
If I struggle, thank God
I'm a count my blessin', trouble but never no stressin'
Just called it a lesson
Cause life will be runnin' that test and better off in a cell
See a nigga walkin' the streets
And they label us foolish children
Cause I always knew this
While the rest of my days I be livin' in Ruthless
Fuck what you're thinkin', law, my Judge is up Heaven
Look at my stomach and see the ""7,""
Even scales is how I'm bailin'
Rebellin', tellin' y'all nothin' but a soldier tells
Critic can kiss my ass
I might go to thinkin' about my past
Get mad, I reach in my stash and blast
Fuck all y'all that treated a nigga like we wasn't shit
And soon as we hit, now what do we get?
These fake-ass niggas tryin' to get in our click, all on our dick
But you can miss me, actin' phony in my presence, love it or leave it
You can't believe it
It ain't that season
Get to steppin', hater
Only Mo Thug allowed, say it loud, Mo Thug and I'm proud
Mo Thug and I'm proud
Loud! Proud! Loud! Proud!

Mind of a souljah, mind of a souljah, release and feel me
Better watch for the nightfall when them come
Better watch out for the night stormers
No light's in sight when them run, but then once we warn ya
Caught ya slippin' up out of your game, playa
Wasteland soldier, see what we facin'
Chasin' po-po in the hood like Jason
Casin' your set, fin to blow your station instantly
Fin to be World War 3 if ya fuck with my family, try to test the men
And we single-handedly take over your mind and the rest of the planet
See, I'll be damned if we surrender, agenda's still no pretender
Put it all down, make 'em all remember:
Deep in Hell is where I'll send ya
Welcome to the Land of more indo
We smoke
We choke
You know we blaze
Break out any cup with the pipe, what's up?
Parlay, come around my way
Lay keep it real
Keep it real
Peace be still, time after time, can't forget that money
Man, that money, man
Mo' money be on mind, bottom line

Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day
Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day
(Layzie Bone)
Yeah, I remember back in the days
When we was ""Creepin on ah Come Up"", we was tryin'a get paid
Before a nigga really came of age
We was walkin with a trench on, totin that gauge
High tech boots on, blue khaki suits on
Bailin through the snow, tryin'a serve them rocks
Got a ""Pocket Full of Stones"" like UGK
Little dudes gettin money up on the block
Runnin from the cop car, never really got far
'Cept for the time when they tried to knock sparks out-
-My aaasssssss
Got me thinkin to myself, how long will it last?
Movin so quick, shit, livin through the hit-list
East '99, we was young, black, gifted
Bone Thugs niggas, didn't want none niggas
Cause they already knew how them Thug boys kicked it
Pistols sick, when we was drunk and high
Little bitty niggas that loved to fight
If somethin went down, didn't rub me right
Still to this day, somebody gon' die
Bullets gon' fly, my word is my honor
'Round my way, you gotta walk the walk
On some real talk, have ya outlined in chalk
All I gotta say is, it ain't my fault
Can't be bought, takin no loss
Still to this day, I'm the bill collector
Come wrong to the Bone, and I gots to check ya
Automatic weapon is my selection
Don't need protection, we'll fuck you up
Big Buck is my nigga, don't press ya luck
And y'all still ain't ready to fuck with us
Cause in thugs we trust, and we mean it!

Outta my mind, akin the way I think, to the main-frame of game
Bang-bang, gotta get down for my thang
Shame game, stuck in ruts, ready to fuck?
Put a simple sepena, but give 'em thumbs up
Seven is a sample, but a sign of the time
Fly fast, give me whip up in a cup
And a dime, and a bag, and a swisher for my nigga
In the middle with the Henny, with the heifer with the bald head, long hair
Some here, it's all here, all, yeah
Man I'ma call here, call here, it's all here, walk here
Run here, gone with the wind, and never comin again, then shiiit
Give it on up, give it away
Kids, listen to the words I say
Pray like everyday, is the only way
I can focus through the pocus and the games people play
Run to put the ""Money in a Zip-Lock Bag""
Up and away, better move yo ass
Too many jokes I smoke
Too many smokes, I know
Too many loc's that I passed, my past
Cocked in the set, like Aftermath
Slim shades, lemonade, and a nice squeezed breast
Balls, look at the close calls
I told ya dog, because I know ya, dog
Even when I know you're wrong
And I told the world, all about that hatred
Look at your small profits, they hate little Bizzy
And you know I'm gonna make it, just better watch that sissy
Slowly homie, cold and phony, ascended, splended, spend it shawty
Slowly, I'm more Holy and homie, and Jesus knows

How many more times have I got to tell ya?
I'm all about success, don't fuck with failures
Niggas is jealous, and too overzealous
Don't come in my face and don't talk to my fellas
We hellous, rebelious, and definately straight
Sound like we come from a Heavenly place
These are the breaks, better make no mistakes
Cause little Lay ain't got no time to waste
I'ma face the truth, and I'ma raise the roof
Cause this shit here is mine
I done been around the block about a thousand times
And I done been around the world at least a couple times
My rhymes double times, I hit 'em with the rhythm
When we hit 'em with the rhythm, like we hit 'em way back in the days
Y'all niggas gon' pay, y'all niggas gon' pay
You can hear the Bone song, or the R n' B
Just listen to the radio, y'all will see
Anything go down that's regarding me
I'ma tell 'em off the rip what this chargin be
Or the target be, point it straight to ya dome
I'm tellin you know, just acknowledge the Bone
I'm sittin at home, and I'm polishin chrome
Ready to bring it onnn
I handle my business, can I get a witness?
Niggas is wantin to be me
Not Mike, but little Stevie
I'm the one that's makin it look so easy
Eazy-E, tell me can you feel me?
The best there is, the best there was
The best there ever will be, you'll see

Bad Weed Blues,Thug World Order,2002.0," Man I hear y'all got some good ass weed around here
 Yeah nigga, what's happening'? I got you, how much you want? How
Much you got?
 I got about two hundred dog, what's happening'?
 I got you weed though
 Man this ain't no damn chronic! What the fuck?!?!

Let me tell me y'all
I...I...I..., I got the bad weed blues
Ooh, got the bad weed blues

Last night, night, night, was a real bad night for me
(Let me explain to y'all what I'm talking about, man this
Shit was real fucked up for nigga though, I'm stressing)
I bought a sack of weed, when I got home I seen, (they cheated)
That this tree was just a big bag of seed
These niggas have gotten me for my money
I done spent a couple of hundred, Muthafuckers, naw
I guess I gotta chunk it as loss
But I'm mad cause I'm puffin and I'm puffin
And I, I still ain't cough
(Man this shit is not getting me high man, I am not high)
This shit too soft, I need some weed that gotta kick or punch
The shit that fucks you up
That won't hit it and quit it cause you'll be too lifted
After you've taken a hit from the blunt
The gobo was working me like a downer
I need to be easy, easy, easy

Let me tell me y'all
I...I...I..., I got the bad weed blues
Ooh, got the bad weed blues

All I wanna do is smoking, and choking
But ain't nobody got no goods, so I gotta move on
I gotta find it really good, good for my lungs
Yeah, yeah, yeah, cause I'm in need for that sticky sticky green
And have my blunt checked, so that nigga had an attitude
Excuse if I'm rude
But that's just the way that the weed, does you do, ooh
Throw your hands up if your weeded, uh huh
Throw your hands up if you need it, come on
I'm searching and I'm searching and I still ain't come up
Why didn't I think of this before lil Dre, let me hit'em on up
I hit'em up, he said he'll come right through
He got the L.A., L.A., I said I'll be right through
I finally got my blunt, I'm feeling so good
But it's so hard to find a real goody good in my hood

Let me tell me y'all
I...I...I..., I got the bad weed blues
Ooh, got the bad weed blues

I just got off the plane from Cali, I was smoking so good
Need to get me sac right now let me roll through the hood
Now I can't find Tweet, and Ken out of town
Now I'm thinking what I'mma do when I gotta get high
And then fuck around when it comes to the herb, I slurge
Anything ain't gonna cut it, I just got paid with a pocket full of money
And today I ain't on no budget searching high, low
Out of my mind I'm ready to blow
I'm feeling the stress, I'm getting depressed
Weedman don't love me no more
Nd I'm driving through the city, feeling empty inside
Cause I can't get high and this shit ain't how I ride
Stopping and hollaring at my niggas
Petty hustling and thug felon twice convicted thug felon
Just to see what he was selling
It was the (???) we was in
He swore it was the bomb, I was ready to flip but I stay calm
Capping twenty in, and stay charmed
My momma never said, momma never said, they'll be days like this
I'm breaking rules but nigga, ooh, I got to blaze this shit

Let me tell me y'all
I...I...I..., I got the bad weed blues
Ooh, got the bad weed blues

You ain't going tell me ain't no sticky in this whole fucking city
Where's the weedman?, when you need them
I want hollas from my niggas all around the way (Wuz up Big Blood!)
My homie Big Blood, he just gave me a sack today, a sack today
And ooh, even though we selling llelli , he pulled lil Bizzy to the side
He insists lil Bizzy you know my lil sister she does braids
My hair must be fucked up, but it's cool though, ooh
Then lil Bizzy pulled up to the side and said
""Hey Big Blood, you got some dro?""
Let me tell me y'all
I...I just wanna tell y'all why, I
I got the bad weed blues
Cause ain't nobody got no gushy, so I'm smoking plenty gobble
Going crazy

Let me tell me y'all

And I'm waiting for the Lord,oh please don't leave me forsaken
Caught up in the doom,prepare for Satan
So we facing a situation,while I'm drunk I'm staring
Heavily sedating,wonder will I make it to the pearly gates,nigga?
Or will I burn off in that lake now?
When you feelin the earthquake shaking the dead awake
How many waited too late? it's over now
You niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable
Having a little trouble,unable to feel ya soul
Better bleed the blood of Jesus
Watch how the majesty control it
Don't let it go,slow down hold on
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah, Amen
I'm feeling the Holy Ghost make ya moves soothe ya
Smooth, I'm able to free ya mind in the way that my God designed, when the world drop dimes
This world, you'll find there's no other like my kind

Gunning thangs, Redrum when strumming pain
Mo murda, I heard 'em holla holla, clock dollars
Swallow me baby cause we balling hollow point tips to the CI
Enemies keep falling, and I'm off embalming fluid
Making me nauseous, cautious these niggas is flossing
Nina Ross tossed out on Slawson
It's for the auction rapper pop a copper got gospel on 'em
Who wanna magnum, who wanna tag 'em
Bag 'em up  no problem, baby (bitch)
Smoked out in high school
Sleeping at friends cribs selling chicken
Gotta get paid we in the kitchen
Cooking up yay away we go,go wit em
Whole lotta muthafuckin guns
Another fifth took one hood shot she split up
Don't nobody get up,or everyone get lit up & hit up so hard it make ya sit up sit up

You with me nigga you wit me
Militant-minded, perfect timing it
Always on the incline and shit
Nigga that's down for the grind and shit
Keepin' real niggas rewinding this
Deep in the ghetto in the streets of Cleveland
We call it thieving mind deceiving
Hear the reasons for hustling season
Bottom line money is power
And the power mean muscle
Money and guns stacked up to the ceiling
Nigga get down for his hustle his hustle hustle
Now nigga now what you gon' do when they come for you
Well I'ma tell you right now what we gon' do
Scream M-O-G and start blasting
Nigga never did like them boys in blue
No regards for authorities
Wanna dump a nigga up with the thorazine
Oh you invited to the bloody-ass whore scene
Know what I mean you betta get with the team
Cause this is the soldiers ready for war nigga
We from way down under nigga been waiting for the day
To let off these rounds it's thunder, it's thunder
Got my mind made up, and if niggas straight balling up outta control
Just as those hoes nigga rose
On a mission tryna get that dough
Separated mine through prose
Open and close just like a case
Place to place you're feeling you're safe
HB all up in my face
And it just ain't safe it just ain't safe safe
I'm knowing they want me to catch it in war
Boy, boy I seek and destroy any nigga that throw the decoy
See me I'm stacked and ripping shit
Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats
Tattoos all over my body, seven on the stomach
Skull on my chest, nine millimetre in my pocket
Ready to buck on the crowd
As long as that one little nigga
Sagging and bragging and talking loud
Talking about he bout it, bout it
Nigga I got yo whole clique
Real niggas don't run they mouth
Real niggas make moves and get rich

Rollin in an expedition
Thinking of a proposition
Settle my composition
Feeling relentless,fucking up ya condition
Mo murda competition
How many niggas on the frontline
Ready for whateva my nigga,with your tech nine
Nigga disrespect mine
I win,you lose the draw,full metal rip through thine spine
If you wanna listen to what I say
Hey gotta pay ya tuition
This ain't no free exploit of an exhibit
Cause, my niggas, too exquisite
I'm so armageddon, this is my Smith & Wesson
Here's a nice slug for you
And my nitrogen glyc bomb
Can land on them,nuke them all
Now watch when they all come stormin'
So one by one hit 'em up,they fall
Let off with a little frustration,bust my gun
Bullets hum

Theres no doubt god helps me rise


With every day bullshit I'm goin' through
I be hopin' to make it through another day
Lookin' for another day to live my life
And please get away
I stay high
With my gun paranoia so if they come
Then I dump, dump, dump
That really all I got for ya, this life is crazy
I might go Krayzie if I'm down, don't let them break me
So I stop and I pray to god, O lord forgive my worthy life
And help me through this pain of mine
Pray and I pray I pray
That I could just see the light a fly away, away, away, away
But I know I can call on when I'm all alone
When ever I fall, fall, fall
 2x

Situation got me thinkin' was it worth this
And then it got me thinkin' cause I love this
Stay down and it'll work ya self at time don't be a slave by these choices in life
Everybody wants that miracle just so far from where I go and if its meant to be
Then it comes fa show, fa show 
And I know, I know it gets hard some times
But don't you give up its going to be better times if you believe just believe
There's no tellin' what you receive
If in proof just look at me, look at me, look at me
And you got to love this gift we been blessed with. I do
Number one and nobody can touch this you know
Gotta hit my knees and let them know I thank you wit out you
Where would I be
Where would I go


Ain't no tellin' what this life is bout' to bring
One day ya here the day next ya gone
That's way I try to live right
Don't want to live wrong
And no guarantee you gon' make it home
What go around come around
Everybody know its real when you speakin' tha carma
So do on to others like you want to be done like Mary J no more drama
Ima paper chaser believe that walkin' on the ground is where I plat my feet at
If it's not bout money don't need that
You can keep that gossip can't you see that
Stay locked on my mission
Cuz most of these niggas in the world ain't thinkin' bout the future
Young black entrepreneur
And I'm out to get more
So baby open the door
Nigga gotta let me in cuz I'm getting it again
And I said I was going to get dollars
And if it's not about cheese I holla
Fuckin' with a nigga that's way to pollish
And if the road get to rough I'mma stand my ground
Keep my faith and call on the lord
And I don't hafta worry no more
Even if I fall


I'mma be a soldier
Runnin' from gun shots for the day I see Jehovah
You think you know us
Even though you want to
Don't think I'm in it just because of crossroads
And grab a grammy and did nothing for my family
This artist is half ass and scared to tell the truth
And I'm heartless niggas and I think hes raising to you
To the fo who thought that someone was bullshitin
And admitin' you sayin' anything
Up lifting within' the distance that the kids that use to listen to the don
Better prepare old English and essents of a mission never relied on county and prison
Messin' up my kitchen
Better be survive in you

Just know I'll come back to you, for now I am gone

Don't mourn me too long, death'll get you discouraged
Keepin your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin
I know it for certain if I'm really restin in heaven
No need for you to fear, don't cry
Cause death won't forever have a grip on our lives
So I'mma be comin, be ready for the next shine
Cause I'm a believer that I'll see a resurrection
Don't believe that I'll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin, no drippin, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in piece 'til I prevail
It's just a temporary lay down, I won't forever stay down
So keep me in your memory, don't let me fade out
I'll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong, I'm gone gone, long gone


We hit the road back in 1993
Had a vision like a prophet, the project was go see
The logic was so deep, I come back and do a lotta good
I heard the callin so I headed out to Hollywood
One-way tickets, my niggas and no fear
Some said that we was trippin, the mission was so clear
Don't wanna go there, the money was over there
I still love ya 9-9, I miss ya St. Clair
Yeah, now I'm movin on a roller coaster
Just ridin, tryin to be Jehovah's soldier
And I'm grindin, tryin to make it better for ya
So for now I best be gone, be gone
I made a vow to change the world somehow
I'mma impact it and see it in this lifetime
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine
But for now I'm gone - I gotta go get it


If it's out there to get, then I'mma go and get it
Get it 'til I got nothin left, chasin better livin
It's a 'tinuous mission, so I'm steady movin
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losin
I'm a Thug true, add to or get out the way
You could settle for less, but I need more on my plate
Eatin good, family good
Okay 'til that day I'mma get up and move, move
Show my babies how the Thug do, ooh
I'mma play it like it's my last game
If it's due better give it up right away
Cause a thug nigga's gonna bring pressure
See me fucked up, starvin nigga, never
And as long as niggas out here gettin paid
Back to my old ways, who they gonna run and tell, huh?
It's a street thang, c'mon


Yeah we ready, back up in 'em with nothin but the harmony rhythm
Hard hittin flows all we give 'em
Flows that spit venom, no cop, there goes the end of 'em
Ever since the beginnin we winnin it
Get a glimpse of legends standin on deck
'Til we come we'll be here holdin down the set
Keep on wonderin what the Bone 'bout to do next
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless
The fan fam flex all across the U.S
Overseas and Tel Aviv and back west
You know we go the hardest, no need to say we better than the rest
It's obvious more or less
Came down off my high from the wet
When I had to do a stretch, I signed so I cashed the check
Had me caught up in a game, insane, my head blown

Cause I ain't with bein' broke
I'm rollin' dope, and I'm bound to let the gun smoke
I'm gettin' richer everyday because
I'm selling crack, and, yo, police ain't jack
So I just wait to pull the trigger back
I sell a twenty, a ten, and I won't let you slide
I need all ten, and I ain't takin' nine ninety-nine
So how you figure you're gettin' up around the Bone?
You try to gank, you catch some blows to your damn dome
Don't take no shorts, that's why I'm climbin' to the top
And everyday I sell a thousand dollars worth of rocks
Yo, ain't it funny the way the Bone will make his money
And won't get caught because the cops
To me ain't nothin' but dummies?
So what you need? I'm servin'
Everything is straight. I mean it's great
And now I'm rollin' heavyweight
And coppers hate to see me come up off the 'cane
And makin' ends to Biz is like (just) an everyday thang
Everyday it was almost the same thang
Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

I hit the floor
And now I'm lookin' for my khaki pants
I looked around and couldn't find 'em
So I put on Stan's
And then I headed to the closet for my Fila shoes
They lookin' hit cause I was runnin'
From the biggy-blues (siren)
That's when I headed out the hizzy
And jumped in the smug
And put my skully on my head
And now I'm lookin thug
Car souped up
Posse seven deep
Now we gettin loose
Well since we posse'd up
We might as well go get the brews
I bust a u-turn on the Clair
So we can rush the store
We need a case, or maybe two
Or maybe three or four
Pay for the brews, up in the smug
And now we getting
I be like, ""Word up cuz,""
Brushin' on my peach fuzz
Looked for the party
Cause there's lots of women to be grabbin'
We went on ? to the one Ali was havin'
We stepped up in it, pumped as hell
And yo it wasn't lame
And gettin' brewed to Layzie Bone
Is just an everyday thang
Everyday it was almost the same thang
Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

Load up the pistol, ask Layzie for a couple clips
And get the twelve-gauge, cause I got another lick
Round up the posse, call up James, Wish
And double-Zs, my nigga Tone, ?
You know we scorin' keys
I heard the dread's sellin' some dope
It's comin off the lake, down at the dock
And yo, it 'posed to be at eight
So hurry up, we getting paid, no matter what the cost
And since they thinkin' they all that
They gotta take a loss
They can't hang with the Bones
Get it in your head, forget a dread
I'm leavin' all those suckas dead
We on the scene, I must admit, Hoop Phi's drunk
They started slamin' those dreads like a power dunk
I mean, blastin' and crashin', K-Bone is the assassin
I started sprayin', and count out caskets
We got the dope, and we got rich
But yo, we still the same, and it'll never change
Cause it's an everyday thang
Everyday it was almost the same thang
Cause it's all about survival of the fittest

Call up your posse, chump, and yo
And you will never win it
Because my organization, see
We got fifty million niggas in it
You wanna scrap? Come on, let's do it
We can get it done
It's kinda funny plus I'll show you that
I'm not the one (I ain't the one)
You stupid bro, now what you ball up your fist for?
Make you think we was buckin'
And capped you down with my pistol
A dirty move, yo, Layzie had the sucka fooled
Yeah, it was cool. They shoulda had the boy schooled
You messin'with a brotha, Bone. Yes it's good to go
I beat on niggas everyday, so, yo, I'm not a ho
So gimme P's if you see me walkin' down the street
Because I can't be beat, known for breakin' niggas teeth
I'm droppin B's, and you never catch me chill and calm
I hang with Vicki when I wanna drop the damn bomb
See all my fellas, and even the Bone
We is insane, and throwin' blows on foes
Is just an everyday thang
Yeah, Layzie Bone up in the house
You know what I'm sayin?
I gotta give some P's up to my homies
That's still doin them everyday thangs with me
I gotta say what's up to my brother Stan Howse
Vicki da Bomb, Wish Bone, Bizzy Bone
And Krayzie Bone, my boy Tony Tone, Old Mo
And the troublemakers in the house

Sons of Assassins,Faces of Death,1993.0,"Now see I'm cockrrring up my nine I'm poprrring in the clip and cap
And let you know what's really happening with that son of an assassin
(Son of an assassin)
Feelin' this killin' and peelin' caps cause I can't stop
My gangsta attitude comes from my muthafuckin pops
Kickin' ass and the #1 Assassin blastin'
Niggas for nothin' peelin caps with a passion
Now, I can remember when I was just a little niggero
Rollin' through the hood with my pops I watched him kill a ho
Boom (Boom!) was the sound of the nine when they kill ya
So you didn't pay your debt but you had to pay the consequence
(But you had to pay the consequence)
And blood splattered all on the ground - it made my ass sick
I watched her fall and hit the ground just like a damn brick
(Damn brick)
He hit the gas, and we was tickets with the quickness
""G, she tried to play me out that's the way it gotta be
Yeah,"" that's what he said, ""Don't tell a soul, if you love me son""
He gave me a hug. I said, ""I won't cause I know how it's done.""
And now I lay me down to sleep hopin' that I don't dream
Cause every night I get a vision of that same thing
And like a fool I'm on a block we're sellin' mo' dope, fuckin' wit my cash flow
Like pops I let my gun smoke
I made a promise I won't tell if your askin'
I'm just that muthafuckin son of an assassin

Ever since I was seven I've been a troubled-ass nigga
Used to sneak my father's guns just to play with that triggas
(Don't fuck with my guns, boy)
One day I'm playin' with the nine
I get a flashback, and get to thinkin' about
The muthafuckin' bullies in my class
That's always fuckin with me, but this shit's has to stop
The next morning I snuck
And I stuck my father's nine in my lunchbox
I'm on my way to school, that's when I spotted the faggot
Removed the nine from the lunchbox
And slipped the bitch my jacket
Now I'm lookin' for a reason just
To straight let the trigger click
I walked over to him and said
""What's up now, bitch?""
The fucka-sucka started steppin'
And it swung but he missed
I knew the nigga felt pissed
Cause it was the nine that he kissed
I socked the bitch in the face
And to the ground with this sucka
And this boy didn't hesitate
He broke off quicker than a muthafucka (Run, muthafucka, run!)
Ran inside the building thinking that was gonna save him
But I caught up with the nigga
Pulled out the nine, and I sprayed him
Tossed the gun to the pavement
I'm heading straight for the hizzy
No more will Krayzie be bullied
Cause Krayzie Bone just got busy
Then ran home, told my father
He said ""I know why you did it, son
The punk was fuckin' with ya, so ya had to get rid of him""
Heard a knock on the door, he thought
""Yo, what the fuck is this?!""
Police surrounded my hizzy with reporters and psychologists
My father grabbed his gun and started pullin' the trigger
(""Get him, Dad, get him!"")
Now you know why I'm labeled a little crazy-ass nigga
I watched while my Pops continued blastin'
My attitude is hereditary, nigga
Cause I'm the son of an assassin

My father went in the pen when I was 'bout two or three
They had caught him (Jail ain't shit!)
For manslaughter and murder in the first degree
I haven't heard from him in about a month or two
Until one night when I was watchin the eleven'oclock news
Cause I guess there's some insane inmate
Just now broke out the pen
And he can either be in Lorain
Columbus, or Cleveland
Right then it dawned upon me I'm like
""What in the Hell?!""
And then I heard a ""ring-ring"" on my doorbell
So when I opened the door, and much more to my surprise
Me and my pops was face to face
Lookin' eye to eye (Hello, son)
He said, ""Son I'm on the run
And I don't wanna be alone""
I said, ""Don't say another word
Cause me and you is gone""
I went upstairs and got the gauge
The pump, the nine's legit
Until holice got in the yard and cold stormed the shit
We jumped up into the(Gauge to your ass, nigga) hizzy
I threw my daddy the nine
I shot one cop in the chest;
He shot two cops in the spine
You know I'm pullin' the trigger, right
My bullets steadily hittin'
I go to pull it again, shit (damn)
I ran out of ammunition
(Where the fuck are the bullets at?!)
I reach up for the pump
And in a flash I got dumped and turned around
Police gonna smoke my ass
I can feel my life (Son!) passin'
I know I'm bout to die too
And just before I left I said ""Dad, I love you

Spitting as we run away from prison

Getting ready ah mind could learn to love it
And when I release mine on the public

Against my grind while you coming and stand here
Nigga betta wake up cause they're not blind
While I live the thin line, between love and hate
How many gon' survive armageddon
Just waiting to atone that day
In the Roman gates here to make no mistakes
Handle stakes and man Lord meet me half ah the way

Livin' in ah world so cruel
And I got nothing to lose

Smoking the sweetest cheeba drinking brews

Never ask where the killas at

You know what really make me feel good
Krayzie Bone, Wish Bone - really keep it all hood!
That's right! We still pursuing our dream
There ain't no ""I"" in our team
That's why we doin' our thang!
We gettin' money, money...

So good
{Money, money}
So right
(If you really, really good to get just money, money)
To be with you tonight
{Money, money}

They used to look and see a thug
Now, they look and see a paid thug
First niggas find and make this paper
Through the neighborhood!
Yes, we blessed - we know this!
So I drop to my knees and let 'em know who we rollin' with
Every night - make money, watch paper!
Grind now, fuck later!
If you miss it, gotta' battle back!
Get that money, money - need that!
Gimme some, I'll take that!
Since a youngster, knew about them greenbacks!
Cause it ain't fo' all the money
Fuck what they sayin' - chase money!
Do without it, live without it!
I can't do that!
Live life - I like!
I need every penny
Pennies times this life - better give it to me, to me!

So good, so right
(If you really really good to get just money, money)
Just me with you tonight

Light it up, light it up
I feel good, I feel good
Nigga, from my vibe, I feel good all over!
Light it up, light it up
I feel good, I feel good
Nigga, from my vibe, I feel good all over!

Gun Blast,Strength & Loyalty,2007.0,"Yeahhhh, better back up off me
Nigga never no softy, boy I'll stop your heartbeat
While you out in the street yellin out what you finna do to me
In the middle of your speech I'mma sweep you off your feet to sleep
Fuckin with these thugs
Keep thinkin y'all don't bleed blood and I'mma make you a believer - pop pop!
What you receiver, a motherfuckin bullet from my automatic pistol
Hit you, him too, and all the rest of them niggas that you got wit'cha
I'm collected and quiet, but surprise nigga, I get live
Jumpin up out of that rugged
Dump it, finna show these niggas a little somethin
Reppin shit for Bone Thugs, nigga don't test mine to the redline
But like my Mo Thug niggas say ball, show 'em the gunline (gunline)
Caught in the line of fire boy if you want to (yeah if you want to)
And a nigga gon' be on yo' ass like skunk's funk, pyew!
I grab my dick, let my nuts swing from my thang (swing from my thang)
If you's a anybody killa nigga, let the bullets rain
We be puttin 'em up straight
Cause if you ain't, you done got into some shit
With the thuggish (thuggish) ruggish (ruggish) bloody murder clique

Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast
Comin to slay, fuckin 'em up with me gun gun blast

Undercover man, how you want it man?
I'm a fool on the loose with a gun in hand
I got a sho' shot aim for the runnin man
That'll stop you in the tracks when I'm dumpin man
They did somethin man, niggas talk real loud
Real fly out they mouth when you ain't around
Talkin like a nigga stole they style
When a nigga show up these niggas bow down
Pound for pound from the shoulders
Nigga I'm the coldest, little soldier
Big niggas are ruthless, how quick are you niggas?
Believe I got somethin for ya
In the holster, in the bushes cocked
Up on the porch I got a gauge and Glock
Corner to corner this thang on lock, yeah it's hot on this block
Nigga got everything short of cannons +Wild N Out+, but I ain't Nick Cannon
Nigga got M-11's, SR-15's and I plan to let niggas have it
Fuck this rappin; if it come down to it nigga disrespectin what's happenin
My family, my money, my thugs, myself; my nigga I'm flat out blastin
Countin out caskets on you bastards smashin
If I'm ever forced to bring the action
I'mma ride down I'm pistol packin, we can definetly get it crackin
Old fashioned like the wild west, Ghetto Cowboys, nigga '06
Fake niggas and real niggas in the real world just don't mix


I'm a hundred proof, want a taste?
Take it to the head or the face, wrong place
You can do it, never been a sucka
Nigga runnin with a Thugger, not in the game
Nigga runnin with a Thuggish Ruggish in my range
Better do my damn thing and lift ya mayne
Bet you won't leave the same way you came, we soldiers tight
Put up your stripes we'll rip them off, slash somebody
Back with a attitude that's right
I'm sick with the money spent on bulletproof nigga fight, fight
Handle that, nigga handle that
Give back to the music, fuck that (fuck that)
Reach back, throw back, everybody in the car gotta lean back
See now the game was soft so we back, hit 'em in the head with a relapse
Younger than most of you niggas so what? You die (you die) you die
If I decide then we ride, if it's on you rock-a-bye bye
Thuggstas straight up warned you; you will, obey mine
Oh we will ride, yes we ride in the nighttime
It really don't matter, gettin high, yup in the daylight
Thuggstas no fools, we know the rules, don't get too close with a attitude
Dude, cause ooh, won't like how I give it to you

None of y'all little niggas up on the motherfucking block
Y'all got ta clear this motherfucka off
Curfew nigga, get ta fuck up outta here off my block

Who servin' tha fiends
Hundred thousands of green
For the love of money
Cash all around me
Demons can cloud me
While I'm in the county I can die
Flipped up my style-y as we came at the same time
Baby tempted, in the tension
Ouija shit got you demented
Crash the Benz and ending your sentence
Born for criminal defendants
Critical breaking in the ghetto bar thinking
Millenium shit like pestilence war and famine
Animals move animals reputed
Every daily grades let it be the reason
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies
In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk
I'mma get 'em when they thinking they miss me what
Nigga that thuggish ruggish fuck them up
Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit
All of my dogs all of we lie
Nigga you touched and stuck on murda
Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts
It was the 7th sign regime
Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me
Ya couldn't go wrong wid we
Eyes bloodshot red when I floss instead
I rather run up and smash you wid a passion
And they chalking it off his head
Nigga instead I'mma let them bleed

But if you lie ta me and don't die for me
Look in my eyes and see you can't hide from me
Sleepwalk shit talk nigga
That be running from niggas in the ghetto
Now get on my level rebuking the Devil
Representing like ah heavenly rebel
Even though my screws loose I can tigheten 'em up
And put a twist to the game like a monkey wrench
For the funny shit
All about the murda for the love ah money shit
Gettin' paid, got it made in the shade nigga
If you got and I want it I'mma take it
Nigga made it and I told ya we'd make it
Kept it real and it'd neva be fake shit
Half baked and gone off this indoe stick
Wanna hit it call just as you next

Yeah (yeah, Bone Thugs)
You know a nigga been all over the world man (Australia, China, Africa)
It's the same ol' shit everywhere I go y'know (England)

Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
It all seems so familiar familiar
Struggle in the game - it all seems so familiar familiar
They left the hood for change - it all seems so familiar familiar
Why does everybody's story seem to sound the same?
It all seems so familiar familiar
They done some time in vain - it all seems so familiar familiar
Gotta wise the shit to lames - it all seems so familiar familiar

I can remember that little nigga when he was just a young lad
Nobody thought he would make it up outta the hood before the gun blast
(Gun blast) Cause Johnny wanted to be a thug
Runnin from cops out on the block, the boy was hot and didn't give a fuck
(Scandalous) Runnin up in that black mask
Niggas if you got cash, drop it off in that bag and make craps fast (c'mon)
Destroyin the system, make some money to survive the streets
But you know deep inside that this ain't how you tryin to be
But it's all to think when you're strugglin and can't sleep
Cause you're hungry but can't eat, cause livin just ain't free; but shit
Poppa been laid off (laid off) momma been laid off
Everywhere I hear the same old song


To probably take a loss, I'm tryin to fight these demons
By any means, by any cost I'm out here reppin Cleveland
They got me bobbin weavin, nigga give me the reason
To let 'em flies do or die, niggas no longer breathin
Known as a heathen, before Layzie Bone it was Steven
And I'm just tryna break even, leavin you leakers steadily creepin
Shit get deep when daddy gone (daddy gone)
And momma can't do it on her own (her own)
Lights off, gas gone, ""Momma, daddy comin home?""
I guess not, sell rocks, rappin with my niggas Bone
(Whassup Wish? Yeah, we all we got!) And that's Bone Bone Bone Bone
(Whassup Kray? Yeah, we all we got nigga!) And that's Bone Bone Bone Bone


So you been to the Chi? Me too; you ever been shot? Me too
Sold rocks, all-nighters on blocks, catch cases? Shit, me too
That's the story, no one write it, nobody can tell it for me
Momma workin double shift - daddy who, daddy who?
And when he do it's always later, never came
Now look, he done broke that boy's heart; man again, damn again
Don't wonder why it's like that in the ghetto
Grew up, outta luck, don't give a fuck about life, so we let 'em go
I know my heart is cold, you know how them ghetto children grow
Give me the money, and I can keep my temper low
Everybody knows love, clubs, cars and hoes
Priorities fucked up, but we already know!

Nigga, we represent the planet
Get schizophrenic and panic
Maybe the past would understand if they get off they ass and mash
How do you manage? Paranoid, don't even trust my boys
Watch for them plots and deploys, envoys, scopin
Like a dope fiend, when I'm smoked in the alleys with these ghetto
Guns and erased my funds Watts niggas in Cali take
Bullets to the brains, still rowdy
Jesus really never died for you crucified mutual suicide
Who am I? Loco with vocals, goin' coast to coast
Heaven'll move me, right, for sure
Deception whether my brethren, but sunny days when I parlay
Get killed when I get to steppin'
Remember the weapon (come) and the doctor said
I need time to myself where ocean those frivilous
Thoughts, thug for the Bone, up puttin' this independent stardom
Seven relentless evil intentions, nobody knows 'em, I'm even a henchman, warrior
Poet, never to mention I love my lady rebel?
And we can get the stroke on
And we can get the stroke on

Word to the muthafucka I, I didn't studder but what if I
Lost it and came in the office and nobody noticed with liquid explosives on top of
Versace clothes give up the ghost Krayzie's Picasso
Lil' Layzie like Caesar, Stack's like lil' Pesci N
Casino and Wish don't give a fuck!
O I'm Gambino 'n the walkin dead wake up on the wrong side of the bed
Bible of survival triple six rivals, triple six rival
Member you said I read but I roll with killas, Niggas
That'll bust in the club you don't feel us strapped in the bed
Strapped pickin up the kids in the realest, the realest, the realest
This is what it sounds like [this is
What it sounds like, this is what it sounds like
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on
When the thugs cry
When the thugs cry, when the thugs cry
Are you ready, ready, ready? Oh no!
It'll make your body shake when it's too late soon
As you flipped off the safety baby this we all day
Don't tell me you crazy, will they sell me?
Hell, naw! For reason this weepin' widow be the demon so cheap
And at least she peepin' go peep deep dead in yo pockets no sleep
Rollin' with my crucifix Lucifer usually uses the rule of these
Wicked tricks in the school of these ghetto games
And the fool of this bitch's mist I say shame, shame, shame
Enemies attacking me actually I'm in the grain ask Mr. Majesty these
Casualties well they're passin me by but I hear death
Callin' when it's so cold in a room who's stallin'
Better come after me, we say fuck y'all all in the
Battle we, battle we, battle we

Don’t Waste My Time,T.H.U.G.S.,2007.0,"(Intro - Krayzie)
Stay on the grind and rise on up, give it all you got
(Repeat 5X)
Verse 1 (Krayzie)
Shit, we done come up a long way
We crept and we came, we did our thing, just like the song say
Nigga's been talkin about us like it's Bone Day
They say ""them nigga's my nigga's ain't kickin it no more.""
They say we all went solo, ""nigga's ain't even speakin no more""....You sure?
Nigga don't they know y'all been my dogs since back in the day. (Yep)
We been through some rough times, but never enough to make us break up
Besides, Bone is a business. Even if we didn't kick it, nigga this is business
So quit all that beef and come get this cheese
Nobody really been knowin the drama we done seen
Like my nigga Flesh in jail, stressin in that cell
And we been strugglin nigga, so we might spot ya with some bling bling, and pull a Glock
Thuggish, ruggish nigga's, probably heard about us runnin up, checkin these busta's
Actin like they ain't gonna respect the Thugs, muthafuckas
We ain't givin a fuck no more, we get smashed and play with the dough
Kickin ass just so that you know, for the money we goin for broke
Chorus (Krayzie)
I don't waste my time without no dollar sign
If you ain't talkin 'bout no paper would you stay outta mine
And don't be tryin to test my patience cuz I do pack a nine
But y'all ain't really tryin to go to war
(Repeat 1X)
Verse 2 (Layzie)
See these mind's was handed the raw. And nigga's, they fuckin us, make the law
And sick and tired of seein nigga's flossin, put it down real 'til I'm in my coffin
Scrape a lape, can't get me bent. Nigga this tank don't run on fumes
And if I ain't got it you can assume, about to go get it and nigga's is doomed. (Caboom)
Cash is closure, this bank is run up before. Nigga better picture me when I'm rollin
Homie this nine is what I'm loadin, tryin to take me for the easy stick up
You better be pickin up your place or get a taste of this one eight seven murder case
It's dun-datta, no longer ""see you tomorrow.""
I'll be screamin ""not a shotty,"" he shouldn't have had no problems
Top to bottom, in's and out's, and if you don't know then close your mouth
Guessin games can lead to droughts. When they fall over, your ass out. Blast em out
Number one; my family, number two; don't touch my money
Number three, just respectin everything that really sincerely love me
I'm a real thug strong and weak, the rich was in the poor
But you gotta get on your feet even if they blistered up and sore
Chorus (Krayzie)
I don't waste my time without no dollar sign
If you ain't talkin 'bout no paper would you stay outta mine
And don't be tryin to test my patience cuz I do pack a nine
But y'all ain't really tryin to go to war
(Repeat 1X)
Verse 3 (Bizzy)
Choke like nigga's choke when they get that corner on 100 and 44
Smoke and think platinum, gun in my coat
Stick to my grill, lane switchin fixin a scrill
Look at the perfect one, show you right, please be still
Bought a new chest, honey coat cover the vest
Black and beautiful, oceanary quiverin lips
I've been to funerals, seen 'em in the casket dead
Across the wall, the shit is hurtin my head
Fed's talkin, they watchin me in the bed tearin my broad up
""That dick is kinda small, my bitch is too much.""
C'mon, creep on ah come up and fuck it go to the club, thugs love it
Haters holdin a motherfuckin gun
Bitch you can't be a judge, be real. Enough is enough
Signs are soon delivered, the rivers are filled
Praise Jesis in this ghetto thesis
Only Jehova keep my foster brother breathin, give me the reason. (Cuz I'm a soldier)
Chorus (Krayzie)
I don't waste my time without no dollar sign
If you ain't talkin 'bout to paper would you stay outta mine
And don't be tryin to test my patience cuz I do pack a nine
But y'all ain't really tryin to go to war
(Repeat 4X)

 Kray, Lay
 Whattup Wish?
 You know how we used to get that vibe, back in the day?
 Oh yeah, most definitely
(*East 99 is where you'll find us slanging that llello daily, daily...*)
 Yeah!
 Yeah...
 I remember that
 Me too
(*It's the First of Tha Month...*)
 You know we used to get our hustle on, from the 1st to the 15th?
(*See you at the crossroads, crossroads...*)
 Aw man, we touched alot of people with this one!
 A whole lotta people with this one!
(*See you at the crossroads, crossroads...*)
 Whoa... that was deep!
 That was from the heart, dog
(*Stalkin, gat fools, walkin jack-move, jack-move...*)
 Aw man, this was that street right here...
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)
 Y'all remember? This was that street right here!
 East 99...
 Let's VIBE!

 Now we done blew up, fell off, but came right back up from grindin overtime!
 And you know what's real, we used to wear each other's shoes - what's yours, you know is mine
 Mine too! Can't deny, how the time fly by, it feel like it was just yesterday!
 When we was in the streets, stressed for llell, now we pullin up in big Escalades
 All paid for, money on the wood, so it's no car notes
 We far from broke, that's all I know
 So you better get it right when it comes to my folks, cause we gon ball out
 Blow a little bit of weed, smoke y'all out
 We get everybody goin off our style...
 Show 'em out to do it, thugsta stay right
 He ain't rollin how I roll when I ride!
 We gon' suit up again, incase y'all want war
 Gon' do it again, until we can't no more
 Blowin in the wind with a refreshin blow
 Who knew in the end, that we would be so cold
 It was hard, yup, no, but we can't let go, no
 Middle finger to the po-po! It's that thuggish-ruggish
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)
 And the whole world love it, we gon' give it to 'em like, like!

 Round and round and round we go
 Now you can ride my vibe...
 Now just vibe, just vibe, just vibe
 My vibe, my vibe, my vibe...
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)

 Come and get on the level with me, a regular G's
 Uncomparable, none like these...
 Unpredictable, harmonies...
 Mystic, lyrical, gotsta be... Bone, Bone!
 Cause we make the songs!
 No matter what you're feelin, you can vibe out to Bone!
 Straight off the dome!
 Up in it playa, let's go, flow so strong!
 No matter how we do it we gon' always keep it real
 Even when the higher powers wanna ban our noise
 It'll be back to the block with some rocks and a radio
 Reppin on a corner like the bandaid boys
 Boy, runnin around, puttin it down - flowin!
 Niggas was wild, we did it all - knowin!
 We was the coldest in the city we showed em
 How to get it crackin like a real true soldier!
 Doin' our thing, since back in the day-day
 Chasin change, we gonna make it either way-way
 One-way bus tickets, Eazy listened and
 Flied us back to the block, now he's gone
 Now I got a little money in my pocket, about a couple G's
 It's been a long time since I got it from the streets
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)
 I ain't worried about a beef, but I do keep heat
 Incase these haters ain't vibin with me!

 Round and round and round we go
 Now you can ride my vibe
 Now just vibe, just vibe, just vibe
 My vibe, my vibe, my vibe...
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)

 Now tell me who the realest niggas ever heard...
 Gotta be them Bone boys, listen and learn
 I know they can't believe it, but it's still our turn
 So let's get POD'd and tweeded, tweeded, off herb...
 We stay high, high, all day long, in the mornin when I open my eyes!
 So it ain't no big surprise, how they ride the vibe and get hypnotized!
 Took in by flow, they bank potent like dro...
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)
 After one toke they want some more... they can't let go!
 Still get it on the low - if it's right there, I can't let that go
 I'm a hustler, survivor, strugglin, no lie, on dollars plus more!
 If you really need to know, Mr. Bill Collector's alive
 Step on the scene, collect my green
 Gimme everything that you got, cause I really wanna go!

 Round and round and round we go
 Now you can ride my vibe
 Now just vibe, just vibe, just vibe
 My vibe, my vibe, my vibe...
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)

 Man I remember when we used to try to catch that vibe off that Banana Red
 Man we used to drink that motherfuckin Thunderbird with the Kool-Aid in it
 Ah-ho man, but remember Olde E and Crazy Horse?
 Aw, that shit dog, but you know what was crazy, the Chuggalo!
 Oh man, we used to sit around, and put everything in one thang and just DRINK it!
 Man, everybody put that candle in the middle, boy we used to be vibed out
 Haha!
 Hit up magic man for them dime sacks, bout fifteen joints
(*It's that Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone-Bone...*)
 But you know what, it wasn't nothing like that Sisco!
 Ooooh, that Sisco, that Wild Isles Rose was that shit though
 That, put that hair on ya chest...",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-just-vibe-lyrics

Little help from E eternal we will him will neva forget him

Find their souls to the rockin feet
Maybe to me that's more than money
Better than anything I could imagine
All of ya souljahs keep on smashin
We could chill in the hood look mansion ansion

Everythings gone be a little nicer

Survival,UnKnown,2019.0,"Girl, I'll be there when the mornin' comes
'Cause these ends were made for survival (Talk to 'em)
Girl, I will be there when the mornin' comes
'Cause these ends were made for survival

There's many levels to my hustle, the struggle won't take me under
They wonder how I survived it, kill it and revive it
Witness a survivor, the mind is strictly the provider
The ambitions of a rider
It's too strong, I gotta make it
But if makin' it mean I gotta fake it, I'd rather stay on my Kray shit
Basement, nigga, we keepin' it real around here
They tried to lock us out of the game so now we're coming from 'round rear

Gotta hold my head up high while I got ten toes on the pavement
The survivors are so real with one foot in the grave
We just signed a new deal, plenty more money to make
I can eat whatever meal, now I can get my bills paid
I still hold down the block, I still runnin' and duckin' cops Tryna slam me back down but that's not possible
I'm keepin' my eyes on the prize, man, that's how I'm focused
Pedal to the metal, in my own lane, wide open

Girl, I'll be there when the mornin' comes (Huh)
'Cause these ends were made for survival (Talk to 'em)
Girl, I will be there when the mornin' comes
'Cause these ends were made for survival

I won't die, I won't die
I promise I won't die, tonight (Yeah)
I won't die, I won't die
Girl, I promise I won't die, tonight (Yeah)

Hey, look, I do this for the art of rap
Serious like a heart attack
Focus on the paper I stack 'cause I need a larger pack
Death, see, I can conjure that
Here to bring the honor back
Get respect so kids in the ghetto can one day follow that
I'm runnin' a marathon, niggas is out here racin' me
Ain't no erasin' me, ain't no disgracin' me
Ain't no replacin' me, I do this for tomorrow
But if I die tonight, I die a martyr

It's Lil Bizzy, he be still in the zone
When niggas ask me what I'm doin', I proceed to make it known
You don't have to be the coolest, it don't mean you ain't a Bone
I'ma have to be the truest, I'ma leader, leave the throne
Nobody fuckin' with nigga, I be ready and then I be gone (Gone)
And after I'm done, they be headed for warfare
Anywhere that it's on
Have no motherfuckin' fear and I put that on the Lord
I'ma pull out one of my swords
I don't give nobody none of my tears, I live in war

(Girl, I'll be there when the morning comes)
'Cause these ends were made for survival

Give 'em an inch, they want a mile
Show 'em love, they  are cowards
That's why me, I'm scopin' like a thousand niggas
Pop now, for tomorrow niggas
Rockabye ain't never say never, gas out
That's on my mental, it's simple
When hustle continue, continue
If you not playin' the real games then step out the way
'Cause 'round here is real things, that's all day
'Cause what I been through, I been through
In my mind, it's no equal
Strategize, minimize, divide the fake from your people

I won't die, I won't die
Promise I won't die, tonight",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-survival-lyrics
Mind on Our Money,BTNHRESURRECTION,2000.0,"People ask me how do you maintain
You got to keep your mind on money (T-H-U-G)

Nigga 1993, hooked up with Eazy-E
1994, rushin through the door with the Bone flow
Nigga was creepin on a come up, doin it for the love of money
With platinum shit to split'cha the way we hit'cha
1995 we really let 'em know, Cleveland is the city where we come from
Brought styles muthafuckas never heard before
But we never got our props
'til we dropped that sad song, see you at the crossroad
But the man know, Eazy runnin with the lost souls, rest in peace
That was 1996, we back in the mix
I guess they thought that we'd gon' quit but we got love for this shit
But everything started changin, business rearangin
Then the time when Bone and Ruthless wasn't vibin
Tried to keep my mind together through that industry shit
Somehow I'm feelin like what I deserve I didn't get
But I'mma stick it out, believe I'mma keep my head up
And show my loyalty for Eazy E, even though I'm fed up
1997 hey, everybody grab ya weapon, its the art of war
It don't stop, it won't stop until we drop, body rott
Not to mention when we venture through the family scriptures
1999 nigga, still strugglin
Tryna get some money with this mastermind I'm jugglin
Sharpen up ya thug mentality
And by the year 2000 I'll be thuggin, but so immaculate
I gotta get some money, blast if I get hungry
So if you read that I done flipped, then you know the story, about me

Split up and fry, open his eyes ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? pop

In '91 I'm runnin from the fuckin cops, don't ya know it
That bitch was tryna' find a hidin spot, he show it, keep goin

And niggas went cannibal on 'em, either
Smokin that reefer, niggas know how I'm livin
Cause I was havin children when y'all was lookin for women
But mine aside, so why you tellin your sci-fi? (sci-fi)
When niggas ain't have shit, tell me who's the one that ride
We gon' ride ride though, you can call me Mr. Murda-mo
Gettin' jumped, burn the whole store down all by myself
Seen him doin' his own show fuckin with the Bone flow
Heaven and Earth, God and my loved one, and ya gotta roll
And what you want my people to hear, that I'm a fuckin sell-out?
But who's the one on solo shit, and who want me the hell out?
I'll bail out with a pump, that pussy makes me change

Nigga designed a gold crime as I'm racin through this obstacle

Got shot, got out the hospital, started on my mission
Listen, nigga pay attention
Oh, and did I mention, had a tape before I crept on a come up, Faces of Death
Blessin 40 o-z's, Lay and Leatherface and double z's (???)
Niggas often wonder why my mind on my money
Nigga these bitches all up on me, and half the industry phoney
It's like this nigga, I don't even fuck around
If a nigga ain't got no money for Lay, I'll come around
Ain't it funny how niggas turn funny-style
When they think they fall in trinkets, ain't even ran a mile
See my niggas doin a damn thing, Flesh
Trues Humbly United Gatherin Souls, just to let you know

With all that bullshit you stressin me with, testin my wits

Oooh, I know you had a plan, lo-vely!

And you can tell your little girlfriend to stay out my face

What About Us?,Thug World Order,2002.0,"(Chorus 2x)
(What about us?) What about my niggas still out on the street?
(What about us?) What about my partners doin' time?
(What about us?) What about this arresting from the police?
(What about us?) What about my young thugs cry?
(Layzie)
Its for my, incarcerated niggas
That stuck in the pin they coming home
Gotta stay strong cause you ain't alone
Remember you always got love from home
They steal this pain and may not know it
I'm a boy and I gotta show it
I hear them cries from the babies
I wish they had a chance don't wanna blow it
But unemployed for all the little girls and boys
You got'sa, love your mom and daddy
And make them wonder why you give them ploys
Oh boy, its getting deep but more expensive then ever cheap
But what about that little nigga running the streets
Making a living through his beats
What about these whack ass politicians
They don't care if we live or die
What about that elderly barely breathing, gotta survive on SSI
They say America, it's the land of the free and home of the brave
Its mass hysteria, so bring your knees and hope we can fight
And if bury us, at least we can live as we believe
Dog ain't ever gonna break our pride
Ain't nothing you can do to keep us weak
And all of my soldiers come together
Get on your feet and get ready to bust
What about this war against terrorism (fuck that)
And what about this war against us
(Chorus)
(Wish)
What about them thugs that's dead and gone
What about them thugs that ain't even grown
What about them thugs that out here lost
And ain't ever gonna find their way home
Suspicion got you furious, so grab your shit and listen up
Its violence and violence, it's the only way their gonna respect us
If its this system, in the ghetto back far to one place one time
Know we gone, how they sleep at night if they know they be lying
This shit we deal wit', we young black and fit less
Living in the ghetto to ghetto and ghetto
To ghetto cause ghetto is all we know
They beat us down for dumb shit, they lock us up for dumb shit
Find out that I'm innocent and still gotta fight for money they owe me
And they wonder why we riot in the damn streets
They can't hold us down we getting all that money
And watch what I tell ya, everybody wants some
How they get it they don't care
Try to kick it when you spittin' real smooth
But they listening in my business trying to fuck up my move
(Chorus)
(Bizzy)
Dead niggas I've been to war
Been tall with shit I seen it all
Like soap operas from ghetto stars
I can tell when rappers getting bored, really
Sometimes she a bitch sometimes my lady
And times when niggas die she help like I was a baby
The simplest things in life were always the best
Breathing you ass back inhaling when chronic in your chest
Hey somebody call my momma and help me one more time
Before I die my momma she carry me no comma
Niggas bitches and drama
I recollect walking and stoppin'
Cops not even checking on me, juvenile delinquent
And baby y'all be respecting me
The B.O. it taking me in
Whether we saving fuck the last thing we did
And let the cops see all the shit that I did
Like spittin' on them foxies skied up
In the palm of my dick
This is the life that I love
This is the life that I live
And it's a life full of lust nigga
(Chorus)
(Krayzie)
My partner called me after court
They said they got 25 to life just for slingin' some dope
They making some cheese just to feed their folks
And they like somebody won't go home
Its sad cause its sadder for us to get caught up by the po-po fo sho'
And what about our boys and young girls
In their wicked young world
Coming to school wit' heaters bustin' their teachers
Whatever happened to family and humanity we posses
What about our babies, that struggling in this mess, don't strees
Crooked coppers scaring the niggas off in the hood
What about them niggas that get blown off this block if they good
See most of the niggas still on the street
Still struggling and hustlin' trying to get something eat
Some of them resting in piece and some will never get free
Bone Thug gotta show love, keep it real and really real
And let 'em know about us

What about us? (Repeat till end)",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-what-about-us-lyrics

Bone (Bone) Bone (Bone) Bone {*echoes*}
It's goin down man, yo (yo) yo (yo)
This how we do it

Now that I'm gone
None of my enemies can hate on me now
And all my friends can do is pray for me now
Only God can judge me

Now that I'm dead and gone I finally got these niggas up out of my business
Death has severed all my friendships, it's been hell ever since I've been here
All these fake niggas come to my funeral, look at them sheddin they dry tears
Look at my baby mamas and them trippin out, actin a fool front of my kids
Then I got niggas puttin drug paraphenalia in my casket
A spliff, a picture of me still livin and a bullet from a Magnum
Man I feel bad for my family, but in death it's a safer place
Than bein amongst these chumps and scavengers, then one of my niggas say
He said, ""I'll see you in the afterlife"" (in the afterlife)
Don't he know that it's only G-O after life? My nigga been learned wrong
I don't plan on goin to heaven, I'm tryin to get ready for the resurrection
But until then I'm patiently restin, think of my sins, no need on me stressin


See now that I'm gone and I'm dead and I'm buried in life in a hurry like why did I run with straps?
I made it, tell Fe-Fe don't worry, I scrambled and scurried but only my lungs collapse
Surely I'll make you a song for that, how could I really go wrong with that?
Sayin that smokin was killin my vocals, not sayin that Layzie put on for rap
Known for rap and soldier'd up, can't none of y'all say that I owed y'all nothin
When I fade to black just hold it up, y'all better say that I made y'all somethin
When the shells collapse and the soul relax, lookin down at yo' body (Wally)
Walk through the tunnel went into the bright light, hopin he did right by somebody
I mean, I ran with the right team, did my dirt had fun in the night life
It wasn't a pipe dream, my legacy tellin me I live Christ-like
I hear what they sayin but fuck all the weepin, I peep it just keep it, I live mine
Celebrate them good times, just read the will, Stevie, Stevon


Life dealt me a raw deal, had to make it for what it was worth so went on to sick-ville
Just what have I done? Signed in my balance then had to get strong when I took the deal
Strugglin and strivin, farther my purpose to toil harder
Tryin to make good off my honor 'til a hater really make me a martyr
Kiss my - gonna miss my daughters, hope I taught my seeds proper
I love my mother and father equal but I did damage to so many people
So much evil it's hard to see through the dark, gotta fight fire with fire
Let it spark and light up my way, they said he went out in a blaze
My enemies steady hatin waitin for me to take my last breath
No longer Flesh, had peace and yet the rest consume and avenge my death
Served my stretch, did my best then it's back to the Lord who made me
All the rest of y'all can judge but it's only up to God to save me",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-only-god-can-judge-me-lyrics

Nigga you really ain't talking no sense
Out of line wid out a dime
Motherfucker you got me ready
It ain't no honour amongst thieves
Won't waste my time smoking weed
Wid all these petty conversations
So I avoid the playa hation

The souljahs marching on prepared for war
The souljahs marching on prepared for war

Still, got the gun on Frankie Sosa
Fully automatic four mathematics original souljahs
See nobody can't stop me betta watch me back out
Woke up in the county as soon as I passed out
Bullet passed the pigs mo murda mo money let's mash out
Mo and mo cash for everyone in the room
Every homie know we move you know the scope is on
Come in and snooze who feeling my music true dat
Cause if I was in there
I woulda been looting like the rest ah y'all knew dat (Bone Thug)
Know we knew that in your conscience
You ain't nuthing but a mobster
You can't be budged
God only can judge you (Thug Luv)
Loot all the cops erase the judge
Heading for the fifth dimension mention
Then settle some stuff legal
All I really wanted was a Regal

The souljahs marching on prepared for war
The souljahs marching on prepared for war

Now who gon' be the last two soldiers standing
Doing back ta back holding the cannons
Another episode of my bloodish
On hit wid ah low blow
Just a thugging ass nigga
That's ready ta get some sense
I sorta like Billy The Kid
Mixed like a leather show no mercy
Filthy gonna kick in explicit some material too deadly
So prepare the description advisory
If you rise get ready fuck wid me steady
Everyday all day daily haters wanna come try fade me
Unleash the guage release bush
Trying ta feel it the wrath of the whirldwind
Sware you'll wake up fast motherfucker
Before the fifth dog holla missile off
And blast you between your eyes serving no homicide
Victim is blown right, all we know she got decapitated
Nigga your body rot in the crypt
We taping it up to the ceiling graded
Time from time and again my niggas had ta warn
All you enemies of mine I'm coming ta storm
My niggas be storming through wid army and fatigues
Feel the grief artillery nigga them prophets
To the apostle living a revelation set off the revolution
Nigga the desperado, you niggas can't fuck wid the fifth dog killer
Now haters die die die die....

Back in the days, hey
What more can I say, you waked
In the thang with a double-barrel sawed-off shotgun
'Fore ya know it, I'mma bust that thang
Smells so good, it overwhelms that stank
How could I hate you, when I say thanks?
I pull away, I roll like tape
Solely approaching, destroy them snakes
Thoughts in the sand and the grain of the mind
Like the ring that's around that Saturn line
Still in my prime, never gon' leave
Not without Eve and a baby on my sleeve
Boom-boom, leave
Put it on Steve
Holla at g's, please be cordial
Enjoy yo drank, enjoy yo food
Say what you more-so, murder that torso
I put a quarter on my brothers and flowers and trees
Enemies good, baby boy breathe
Think to save ya
For the light, yes I believe
Before I leave, take this money in peace
Abraham style, watch that beast
Judas is forgiven, re-livin, now keep it in preach
In this world, you must have you some breast, balls
And have you a couple of brawls, yeah
You know what we gon' do
Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day

So you can keep your coffee
I likes my sticky-icky crystal clear with some chocolate toffee, c'mon!
I put the ""Money in a Zip-Lock Bag""
Tell the lady look over the contract
Gotta go, gotta mash
Get wit me, and that's that
Another show, finna get more cash
I'm finna roll out fast
A wheel spinnin in the beginning
The women gettin in an elite, the fleet
The shit, I'm drift, can't see 'em, get 'em
Move me down, they wanna slow me down
They can't show me down, now slow down
Whoa now, whoa now
In the shade, low down, go up
What'chu think that I'mma tell you go down, grow up
Enemies come and get grown down, thrown down, torn down, thrown down
Take that bitch, get another one, pronto
It's just that man in us
And ain't know which to find
Now who the leader with a nine millimeter
And a dime and a grand to touch
Now Christ, who's everything around me
Heey, that's who found me
Give me a pound b, that purple haze
I'm on an air plane, air line ticket, and I'm still a little dazed

Wanna Be,Uni5: The World’s Enemy,2010.0," + (Krayzie)
Ohhhh, ohhhhh (so you wanna be a star, star)
Ohhhh, ohhh (never, never, never)
Ohhhh, ohhhhh (you say you wanna be a star, star)
Ohhhh, ohh, ohhh (never, never, never)

I think you're gonna have to find who you are
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be a star
A star, do you wanna be a star?
Can't find your, lane but you wanna be, wanna be a star

I know the grind, she tryin to be a star, she goin hard
Doin a hundred in the car but never could make it out the yard
Cause you're stalled; how, when you can't even get it started?
It's probably cause you too naughty to get up in the party
She wanna make it so she'll sleep with him, late night creep with him
He'll tell her he can make her famous if she did him
Suck him lick him, another victim of a ""bust and ditch 'em""
Why must you suffer this when really love, what's the mission?
Because you still live in your daddy and your momma house
Shoulda knew homie was not about to go the dumber route
Left you with a lot of doubt, kinda like in a drought
Got no mo' integrity, slow flow, what you tellin me?
There's jealousy goin on, all because she wanna make it famous
And sip champagne with the greatest
So you wanna be a star, the ride you'll take is evident
You'll never get ahead so it's irrelevent (relevent)


Baby girl can sing, she thick, man I think she got it
But they tellin me to watch her, call her baby pockets
So I bring it to her straight, to a real knight
She got herself on protection, we all good all night
She said they only wanna cut, bustas never business
Sometimes she wishes but uhh, maybe then they'll listen
Dirty game, I feel the same
And do I think her career woulda jumped if she just laid down
A tear in her eye, baby don't cry
And then she told me all about her church background
And how she lovin this life, livin this life
Now I think I'm dealin with a headcase
Any heart put it all in, tell yo'self it's a must-win
Apply pressure never give up, laugh in the end then fuck 'em
Stay on yo' paper nigga straight face, attitude nigga pay me
Still wanna be a star, huh, huh? Reach hard!


Hear you wanna be a star, huh?
Think you got what it take to make it large, huh?
Don't even know who you are, huh?
You say you wanted to learn it, huh? You say everybody feelin you
""Flesh I hear 'em"" - what a wonderful tinglin feel in you
How straight are your priorities? So the story goes
Chasin dreams, all they tellin them is sacrifice they souls
You really listenin? Learn a lesson from these bro's
Playin the game it's heavy heatin up and down that road

They say the boy got talent but he can't catch a break
He doin everything he can but he makin mistakes
Plus he runnin with the crowd cause he wanna be seen
Got the tendency to follow instead of takin the lead
We in the league of extraordinary gentlemen check
And if you wanna play the game you got to give 'em the step
Make no impression with expression but you gotta be focused
They don't pick you for the team just because you the dopest
Too many niggas got the game twisted lookin for fame
Instead of lovin what they do, and makin a name
It's a shame how they idolize the idiot box
Feel the pain in television, the deception and shock
And when they finally figure out it ain't about what they seein
Take the money and the toys, niggas still human beings
All of that ain't jack if you ain't got the respect
Cause a real superstar know how to double them checks, yep


I see women givin they bodies like David Letterman love you
Strugglin in the hustle, slangin tapes on the internet avenue
Get you capitol shit, know how the ratchet do
Sorry I was late to tell you exactly what masters do
You don't have to sell your soul, no not anymore
Parker Brothers, Ouija board, I covered that Adam whore
Niggas get their labels but wait, it's a recession in weight
You downloadin on all the industry's veterans
Been a star but bein a star don't pay the bills
Know 'bout the spinnin wheels, baby Bizzy keep it real
Don't open battle seals, no matter who you are
Now get your money, only Jesus can make you a star

 + (Krayzie)
Ohhhh, ooh, ohhhh (so you wanna be a star, star)
You wanna be, you wanna be (never, never, never)
You wanna be, ohhhhh, ohh, ohhhhh (you say you wanna be a star, star)
You wanna be, wanna be (never, never, never)
Wanna be a star, star, star, star

 bang with the Glock on Sunday
Never know I might bust on you one day, ohhh
Swiggin' with Jack and the bombay, ooh, bye, bye blow-blow-blow
Yeah, nigga, fuck you, oh hell yeah, fuck you too
Better than God devised, realize you can end up bigger
But my niggas in the middle hopin' they won't starve
The foul sinnin' beginnin' now
And then nobody get they mental together
And they tell the nigga it good to be back from prison
But don't nobody feel him but them niggas around the globe
And the mission was money was gold
Everyone nutty when money because he was out of the gutter
When nothin' but avid souls better make-up to trust
No one will touch me one wait 'til they ruff enough
Got him at last but I just corrupt
I don't even erupt
Creep on ah come up, what up?
Trapped in a rapture, the trumpets pumpin' tellin' us somethin'
Snatch you, we havin' a blast you tattered like cattle
And medallions, diamonds in the gallows
Ghetto rich bastards runnin' much faster than the average asses in the shadows
Out of the battlefield

Nigga, thought I told ya (Told ya)
That the war ain't over (Over)
You could roll, you could roll, you could get rolled over
My nigga, we the frontline warriors
I thought I told ya (Told ya)

And when they ask 'em who is he
It's 7th Sign and Bone (It's 7th Sign and Bone)
Call me a secret weapon (Call me a secret weapon)
When the war is on (The war is on)
And when they ask em who is he

Tortuous ways of extortion and that piece
I'm beasting? for ever more I'm on my Cheech
I'm beasting on the floor, keep a cypher on my streets
My niggas love to pour, out they soul and they my peeps
For keeping me informed, on my publishing, so sweet

I could've hated more, your so bad I just not chic

Seen things that'll make you hate me

Make you really wanna go and just
Smoke someone, choke someone, poke someone

Hold up son, slow your roll and blow it up

Everytime,Uni5: The World’s Enemy,2010.0,"Every time I, turn arouuuund {*4X*}
Every time I turn my head, man
Somebody's schemin on a bad plan
Tryin to deal a nigga a bad hand
One after the other, harassin a Thugsta
At first they try to bring me in court for child support
Women deception and they lies
I'd rather keep my jim' in my shorts than save a hoe
I have to go and serve state time
There's always somebody talkin 'bout you owe 'em
I made not a dollar, you didn't sell nada
Niggas ain't even grateful that we let y'all ride
You better be thankful we even let y'all shine
Every time I turn around there's somebody straight trippin
Hatin on a mission, fakin on a nigga
They always talk with some dump in they mouth
Like Bone Thugs won't really turn it out
Go down like snitches, sheisty like bitches
They gotta realize that it's five of the realest
Every time that I turn arouuuund
Somebody all up in my business
Actin like you know me, I've never seen homie
He try to lean on me I'ma put the beam on him
Tele-screen on me, really if he only
Knew that we split him like a blunt then roll him
Every time I turn around I see another phony
Thug haters really seem weak for the moment
Bone Thug niggas never beat, we told 'em
Guess they thinkin niggas was weak but we showed 'em
We on top it ain't no stoppin us, the suckas wishin we would go away
So they can flood the game with that garbage
I'm poppin 'em, stoppin 'em, any day they wanna get with Kray
Kray ""Take Action"" Jackson
  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
 I'm duckin haters over here, haters over there
	   Everywhere I turn they everywhere
  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
 Duckin haters over here, haters over there
	   Everywhere I turn they everywhere

Every time I turn around somebody doin somethin foul
I can't turn my back without these haters tryin to shut me down
Plot and I watch, strategize, but the clock
Is sayin time don't wait for nothin, it don't stop
Crabs in a bucket make me wanna say fuck it
Like pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, but y'all lucky
Eastside, front to back, we guard that
Don't nobody want you when yo' ass is broke flat
Yeah nigga all that, we livin in a cruel world
It's rough in the ghetto but we put family first
When friends turn to foes and the enemy's exposed
That's when you gotta move on and kick dirt
My wife and my seeds dependin on me
To make it home safe with them groceries
How it's 'posed to be, they ain't close to me
Yeah I'm in association but I'm playin for my own team
Too much division, head-on collisions
Is blockin my visionary skills
Get back to the mission to pay my own bills
Stay on point and I guard my own grills
Skills I'm possessin, in my possession
Why they wanna rob a little nigga for the blessin?
Who is you helpin, the world or yourself?
Put it on the table cause that's the real question
  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
  Turn around (turn around) turn around (turn around) turn
	 Every time that I turn
  Every time that I turn arouuuuund
 Every time that I turn arou-rou-rou-rou-rou-rou

Keep it thuggin green, nigga sweet, come get it
I wouldn't even take it if I wasn't gon' listen
But look here, this here, some of y'all garbage
I know you didn't feel it when a nigga didn't call ya
Keep your CD, save your money, it's hard to make a dollar
You wastin your time, swallow your pride, be smart
You good to take advice? Alright, nigga get a job
And a message to the niggas tryin to sue meeee
You make me hate the spotlight
Cause I really wanna do youuuu
Lazy-ass bums, in-the-cut cowards
Back door pussies stretchin them undeserved dollars
I know you want a taste, I'ma bring it to your face
Bring it to your face, say it to your face
I hear your little chatter sayin that the Bone done
Smilin in my presence hatin on that Thug love
But Bone got a category, fanbase thug love
Hit the avenues, never done, let 'em know it
Y'all niggas chump change, chase fame, earn mine
Within the right to take mine
Take it to the top with a dream from the block
Didn't believe, now they got they hands out
Make me feel bad with the weight on my shoulders
Damn, every time I turn around
 Every time that I turn arouuuuund
 Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers
	  Come with the drama, nothin can break us
 Every time that I turn arouuuuund
 Gotta watch my back from these haters, cops and fakers
	  Come with the drama, nothin can break us

Every time I turn around
Somebody givin me the rules, a new ordeal
The cops harassin, shakin me down on parole
And put a nigga through the whole damn spiel
This kid lookin polished
No wonder I got a rap sheet way more enough to fill an album
Stack keep it full throttle
They lookin for the heat, that's why they got 'em, C-L-E my motto
Within the Lord I'll abide
Example of a good role model I'm tryin to provide
But every time they pull me over, it's like I'm back on trial
They tryin to catch a thug dirty while I'm ridin
You see a nigga fully rehabilitated
Back reunited with my fam, still we are the greatest
Broke up then we woke up (woke up)
Spoke up, niggas got it together and made up (made up)
Now we got 'em jumpin back on the bandwagon
When we gon' drop? That's all they keep askin
When we do this shit we'll hit the fan
Every sucka that hated on they gon' get a thrashin now
Every time I turn around
These biters tryin to take our sound
But yo it ain't nothin that can fade our style, my style

Every time that I turn arouuuuund
You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier
Every time that I turn arouuuuund
You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier
Every time I turn around gotta listen to the sound
Of the negative crawlin all over the ground
Like look what you did, let me enter in your kiss
Nigga save me, suck my what? I'll kill your babies nigga
So the wicked was the corner place, dweller place
Never gon' eat that, eat that
Satan the original serpent on his last track
Flat broke, dead on his back, crawlin on his belly
Lookin for his celly, I can call the telly
L.A., Kelly, Rowland, rollin
Next my ass, I know you bitch
You gets no ass, goin down like Nelly
Every time that I turn arouuuuund
You lookin over here, got me lookin over there
The devil's everywhere, I'll watch my derrier-ier-ier
  Turn around

Who the thugs with the wickedest rhymes
Wickedest rhymes, wickedest rhymes
 
Bone Thugs back and your gonna be in trouble

We keep it goin' get it for the Mid West
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish
We can't forget about Flesh
We finna drop another bomb
We figure they can't take another rhyme
Come back off and get um with another platinum ryhthm
And they won't fuck in the lab
They want to try to keep up so come on
Thirty million sold and that I'll just stay at that now what about that
Listen to the thuggish
And listen to every other rapper rap about who that come from
Talkin' Bone fell off
Say what they bust just like us
They ain't even knowin' were it came from like richer niggas
They ain't going to give it to us so we gon take it
We just come to tell you that Bone Thugs back
And we still creepin'
 
Bone Thugs back and your gonna be in trouble

Guess who's back. 

Now tell me how many thugs
Get down like us
And still harmonize like the great Temptations
Sit back look back
Came in the game
Came right back (back) With no hesitation
Put up yo money honey what ever ya got we won't lose
Put up or shut up
Get slapped in front of all your dogs
And all your dudes
Cause I'm a smarter thug all ways wanted to be a thug
What do you think
Do you think he gon do something
Don't let the money fool you
Don't let the money do you
Cause it ain't really about nothin' (nothin')
Its just so much they gon let in
Toss that we gon show you who you are messin' with
That's why I started a war in this rap game
You got to hit hard
And let them now who they dealin' with

Guess who's back. 

Bone Thugs back and your gonna be in trouble
 
Who the thugs with the wickedest rhymes
Wickedest rhymes, wickedest rhymes

When we meet on the concrete jungle
We can do it
We can rumble
Take it to the streets
And let the whole world crumble
All I ever seen was heavy smoke in the air
Bustin' heavy shots
They just don't care
If you don't then I'm goin to get all tha bloodiness
Niggas want peace but I know they all gon test us
The thugs commin' back to bring the thug essence
Thugs commin' back to bring back the thug blessins
For the lord where doin' to fight the wind
Imma fight to get them all hyped again
Tell the Bone Thug story again
If a nigga still hatin' a pipe again
Like I did before creep creep and I came
Just four more niggas down for there thang
Never been afraid to let my nuts hang
How to you think Bone Thug made it to the top of the game nigga


Fully automatic loaded
Remy Martin fill my potion
Coastin' on freeways keep rollin' till we hit the ocean
Motion on freeways bout to bustin on niggas bostion
Popi Cholos solo with my pistol so smokin'
Pullin' pop up bitch nigga if you talkin'
Tokin', tortin' with my pistol
Got you people open
These niggas is enemys
Shots up in they body
Never was friend to me

It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang
It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it

De-de-de-detonate a nigga, we so dedicated, really am
But welcome to the party, it's the era of the legend
Every knuckle-headed nigga keep a gun up under the pillow
In the ghetto keep you head up if everything mellow
Pedal to the metal when we off to other levels
We don't settle for nothin' but perfection
Little niggas in the cut, they quicker to catch a fade
They quicker to get shot, they quicker to catch AIDS
And deep in the game, peepin' the lane all the way
The melody, the flow of the record is like hey
Nigga please, the originator do it every day and I'm a motherfucker when I get to spittin', it be gettin' it
Ma-ma-makin' sure that when my niggas sit and hear it we ain't fuckin' around, we gettin' right to the issue
First up on the order, my flow is fuckin' bananas
Did it get cha-get cha-get cha-get cha? haha
Bloody body buried in the city of the 'land
Niggas think I'm doing so bad like God damn
Don't floss, don't flam, don't flam
And it never be a reason for a hater getting jealous of me, bam
Tell 'em bout the fam'
Nigga we get that, get that
Hit of weed, hit that, hit that
Sit back relax and let me get mine, taking no shorts no losses, mane
Nigga wit' that but its just a little more than a catchy phrase
For my niggas in the clique that wonder why we never kick it like we did way back in the days
Like sellin' that, dealin' that
I said I give it up, they tell me they won't give it back
What they wanna do? I'm at the corner of the club with my nigga that I love
On everything that I love, tell 'em put on the gloves, and remember to aim up-up

It's a Bone thang over here, if you feel this then help me sing it

We the realest ever did it, we the realest on the planet
We the rebels for The Lord, never takin' it for granted
I remember way back people couldn't comprehend it
Now everybody rappin' like they really understand it
It was thug, it was managed
It was hard like a challenge
Nigga thought I would slip but my feet stay balanced
Who woulda thought we'd start a hip-hop panic
Bone Thugs drop and other crews couldn't manage
Dipped into my space, had to find another lane
Nigga bought a gun had to go back to the range
Whenever Bone change, it'll never be the same
Takin' no shorts and no losses, mane
Bang-bang-bang-bang, for the thugstas pain
Forever on the come up, nigga, we ain't playin'
And all the kids in the ghetto know the bloody murder mayhem
We represent that, that's what I'm sayin'
For the love for the soul, soldiers that ride for it
I only ride with the ones that'll die for it
I'ma whiz with the pen, you and I know it
But them player haters wanna try to deny, boy
They only hear me when I'm rackin' the pump
Who get outta line, I be sockin' 'em up
With a hologram that make me have to call Pac up
Better call Po-po 'cause you gon' need back-up
Puffin' on the buddah while I let that money stack up
Higher, higher, higher, baby
Everybody wonder how the Bone got back up
Fire and desire, baby
That's right, gotta get it gotta get it while the gettin' is good cause that's Bone
How many more niggas gon' last this long?
Nigga, we move on, we too strong
Come on, come on!

You must be lookin' to suffer, well, I'ma make it quick
Got a train load of ish that'll make you sick
I'm here to wipe 'em out quicker than a pandemic
Bo-Bo-Bo-Bone came original with a gimmick, can ya dig it?
Hell yeah, they can dig it
While I'm sittin' on my throne, steady laughin' at you niggas tryna get it
I'm stacking my figures, what?
 she like to , you need a sweatshop
Better sip slow mister, you lookin' at stars
So what if we are? We form constellation together like the big dipper (D-d-d-dipper)
Nigga see if you can keep up when I'm dippin'-dippin', I'm rippin' it hard
We pull up in your city wit' a convoy, makin' a lot of noise,  nights, we gettin' charged

You need to get a life, get a job, get a wife
You need to get it right, make a real damn name
What you dealin' wit' here is sensational
See, I got folks in the East and the North and the South
The niggas in the pen they gon' know what I'm about
Better know what you're sayin' before you open up your mouth
They wanna-they wanna-they wanna be down wit' the Bone
But they can stay the fuck out the way, comprende?
I'm steady keepin' it caliente, all day, every day
If you rollin' it with the dawg, get your back-get your back off the wall
My nigga, don't stall, not at all
We all came here to have a motherfuckin' ball, ain't that right?
Yeah, y-y-yes y'all

 Don't stop, don't stop the love

 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
(*Don't stop ever, love...*)

Please, I'm just a man, survivin, doin what I can do when I can
I try to move in silence, like to keep it cool as a fan
I try to stay humble, chillin, real, down-to-earth's how I am
But then this business get to pullin me under (pullin me under)
Its makin me so crazy, should I leave it I wonder? (I wonder)
I probably should before it kills me, I know, but
My passions won't unleash and release me, I'm so stuck (I'm so stuck)
Forgive me lord, but now I'm tryna to get right for the cause
Don't wanna be standin on that other side of the wall, no, not at all
So please forgive us, because we know we in the last days
We's a witness, witness... so don't stop, don't stop (*ever lovin me...*)

 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
(*Don't stop ever, love...*)

I know I ain't livin right, and gettin it right is part of my plan
But I been in the streets so long, I think a thug is all that I am
And I'm gonna get it together, cause anybody knows that I can
I can, yes I can, can... yes I can, I wanna grab my life before it's all gone...
When I look at it, ain't did too much, so much of it blown, gone...
Gotta do what's right with what I got now
But it ain't more than what's comin in right now
And now I'm left with choices (choices...)
You can do right (right), or you can do wrong (wrong)
Won't get so nice right now, but we can hold on
But until that day comes, just keep (*ever lovin me*)

 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
(*Don't stop ever love...*)

Now I've been high, so kind of obnoxious, miss you walkin around in my boxers
Miss you kickin it like soccer, other couples tryin to mock us, hold on...
Holdin hands was never in my plans, and then you came along
And made me your man, I must stand on my own two...
Can't understand what we goin through - this for me? Naw, this for you...
But you was the one I shoulda really kept it realler with
But I fucked up and this is real as a killer get
And when we split, I was like a lost puppy
Had to man up, and stand up, so the next one could love me...
But until then, you know I'm gon ride, with the Glock cocked, keep it copped
I hope it don't stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop... (*ever lovin me*)

 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...
 Don't stop, don't stop the love
 It's just the thug in me...

A Lot Of My Niggas Didn't Make It To See This
But I'm Not Gonna Cry
We Slammin Doors On The Caddy Coupe
After Bar Groupin
When Them Niggas Was Out There Shootin
Drinkin 40s On The Roof
Went From Zeros To Six Figures
To Seven Figures And Better
Niggas Determined To Get On The Level
Down For Whatever, Chasin That Chedda
Ride Anywhere Neccesary, The Celebration Is Neccesary
It's A Hard Load To Carry
But That There Was Temporary
I Let It Relax Sometime
Just Chill Out With My Money
Then When Layzie Bone Is At It Again, Another Summer
Lets Have A Ball Nigga And Keep This One Blazin


Hey They Thought It Was Over
The Bone Thugs N Harmony Was Finished
But They Must Of Forgot, They Forgot How Much I Rapper Like I
Sat Back Recline, And Trained My Mastermind
Came Up With A Faster Rhyme
In Time This Dogg Has Got U Hypnotized
So I Gotta Ask Them How In The Hell We Gon Fall Off
When We Got Half Of This Industry Swingin From Our Balls
Me And Dawgs

Cause just like that, nigga gots to have it
It be greens or spinach or cabbage

And work this magic, get on the grind
In position to be the boss
Niggas can floss and talk, but I know they soft
But a nigga like me stay raw
On the D.L., cause what we sell
Ain't none of nobody's business, never was
And nigga never will be
Thinkin I'm broke but I'm out here filthy, feelin me?

Fuck around, catch your dumbass sleepin

Pull a .44 out of the holster, bust on him like real niggas supposed ta
Sticky-icky blowin brew in my leather sofa

She Got Crazy,Thug Stories,2006.0,"I jumped up, got my coat and walked right out of the door
Because she got a little bit crazy
I don't want no deranged lady
That'll have a nigga sleepin' under daisies

I don't want another insane lover
Cuttin' on my rubber
Houndin' me just to tell her I love her
Gotta give it to them big butt girls
The ones that don't give a fuck
""Just-wanna-bust-nut"" girls
When them feelings involved
Now you playin' with fire
Gotta let 'em know from the gate
Man, you ain't tellin' no lies
I just wanna (touch that)
I just wanna (couple times)
I just wanna (no ties)
Can a thugsta hit that there?
No need to blow me up one day, we right back here
Doin' what we do, I see you like that there
Baby girl, let me just keep this fair
You do you and I'll do me
Can we do it, do it like that?
Keep it creepin', creepin'
Yes they say it's better than sneakin', sneakin'
But when it's all over, it's just over
No knives or policemen


Now me and her been rollin' together
Now for quite some time
And she been naggin' a nigga
The whole damn ride
When I first met the girl
Everything was all good
She grew up around my way
So hey, the love was all hood
So I figured it was cool
And we could do this
And, plus she had a booty
That was sicker than lupus
I had to scoop it
Anyway, we started hangin' out
And talkin' on the phone mo'
And before you know
We on her floor doin' the Grown Folk
Everything was cool, y'all
We had it plain and simple
She wasn't my broad, and I wasn't her man
More like ""homie-lover-friends""
She said she understand
But I can't tell she comprehend
Cause she keyin' on my Benz
While I'm sleepin', she be creepin' on me
Sneakin' in my pockets
Lookin' for numbers in my phone
And condoms in my wallet
Then she overdid it
This bitch pointed a pistol at me
Talkin' about ""We need to talk""
Cause she ain't happy
So shit....


Little sweet thang
She love to floss
Clothes to her lip gloss
Makin' hard thugs turn soft
Lookin' like Diana Ross
Slim, sweet and sexy
Something like a little sister
'Til the day I messed around and tried to kiss her (damn)
To be so skinny, baby girl had a nice round ass
I used to stay two steps behind her while I walked her to class
Back in school, a nigga's mission was to fuck 'em and flee
But I was young, so I let her get close to me
And I was kinda in love
Everyday a nigga wit' her
After school a nigga wit' her
At the mall takin' pictures
All the while I got my niggas sayin' I'm breakin up the group
I'm out here missin' my rehearsals
Cause I'm tryin' to knock boots
She ain't even let me hit it
Got me talkin' about commitment
Got me climbin' through the window
Won't even let me get it
Last thing that she said
Snapped me back to reality
We in the 12th grade
Talkin' about ""you wanna marry me?""",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-she-got-crazy-lyrics

Yo, y'all muthafucka's that didn't think we was comin' out
Check this shit out: I got my nigga Layzie Bone in the muthafuckin' house
Bizzy Bone in the muthafuckin' house, Wish Bone
And the muthafuckin' bomb is in the muthafuckin' house
We gonna do a little something like this...
Yeah...Now Krayzie Bone has got the gun
So let's proceed with lychin', yo
My uzi weighs a ton
So now you know what I'm benchin', ho
The weapon is kept in inside the trunk of the 9-ball
Put triggers on niggas
In rivers, that's where they find y'all
So drop to your knees
That's the position, assume it bitch
You slip and you're soon to get
Fucked up by a lunatic
Decide to pack a gat
Well that's the way I prefer
Your forty-four might do damage
But see my streetsweeper's much worse
My shotguns are cocked
Make sure you're stayin' in line
Me twenty two is no fun
So let me play with me nine
I'm steppin' with the Enterpri$e
My only army brigade, and if I drop
Then I just throw this like a hand-grenade

You see no pistol's in the holster
Watch the dot's on your forehead
I'm gunnin' while you're runnin
And there's plenty of bloodshed
There's no sympathy over killin
I already warned you
You crossed the path of a maniac
So now you're a goner
Don't ever step up in my face
Cause stupid bitch, you'll get served
Get on my dick, and stop steppin'
I'm startin to loose all my nerve
Your thirty-eights, your forty-fives
Ain't doin' shit to me
Punk, cause once you're disabled
Believe you're gonna get stomped
Cause you ain't nothin' but a ho, and of course
I hope you get smoked. I put a gauge to your throat
And it is murder Bizz wrote
See, I'm unloadin' while you're foldin' on your niggas
The usual, doublecross me
And I'll bet that I'll be laughin' at your funeral

Now, see, I'm robbin' and killin' and stealin'
Makin' a dope-dealin', that's what I do daily
Cause Layzie gotta make a livin'
And I don't give a damn
I take your life for what you got
If you got what I want, then you gonna straight-up get shot
A bullet to your forehead, there be a couple more dead, bitch
Yeah, I perp like I'm your nigga just to get your ass misled
That's when I rolled up in your house and take your shit away
Thought you had a friend, but I'm a nigga gettin' paid
Real swift, here's a gift, comin' at you is a bullet
The psychopathic nigga on the trigger, they gotta pull it
And I ain't never had no gratitude
Layzie Bone be crazy killin' with a ganksta attitude
Buck, The Enterpri$e is breakin' 'em down
Me breakin' 'em down, man
Bump the Enterpri$e is breakin' 'em down
Me breakin' 'em down, man
Me breakin' down, me breakin' down
Me breakin' down, man
Wish Bone, come down, man

Now we hittin' niggas up, and we ain't comin' cheap
You wanna jump? Feel froggish, muthafucka, leap
We gettin' drunk, start shit, drinkin' sixty-four's
I brought a liter. Where's your posse?
Smack your fuckin' ho. I got your bitch on my dick
Because I'm here for my cap down
When steppin' through C-Town
You better be strapped down
The bigger my trigger
The deader your nigga is found on your doorstep
So how do you figure that you'll be the one
To unload in my fuckin' chest
So when you catch me steppin'
I got the weapon that is kept in on my hip and
Why you trip and find your clip
And tell your bitch to suck my dick
Wish Bone'll pop that ass quick, fool
Don't try to fuck with this ganksta attitude
Buck, me breakin' 'em down
Once again me breakin' 'em down
Krayzie Bone, come break 'em down
Krayzie Bone come break ya down

I'm steppin' in my hood at night
And I'm low up on cash
So gimme everything you got
Cause Bone assualt your ass
Oh, so you wanna play hero, sucka?
Fuck that shit. Die, muthafucka
Never showin' favoritism when I'm blastin'
When I grab my gun
I play the role of an assassin
The K to the R to the A to the Y
To the Z to the I to the E
And steppin' with Layzie Bone
Also the B-I-double Z up in the house
So come prepared
I ain't talkin' with rides
I'm talkin' about with hand grenades
Pistols, uzis, and nines
So get the shit loaded up
You better be quick when you're duckin' out
I'm standin' there smilin'
When I watch ya duck from the buckshots

I got some unfinsihed business
So won't ya's come up with me
K, bring the P-U-M-P
Lay, bring the G-A-G-E
Cause there's this gang all down the way
We gotta put 'em in check
Cause that O.G. was talkin' shit
I'm gonna blow his brain off his neck
We get up in the smug and start to ride kinda slow
And now we're in their territory
So we let all our triggers go
Twenty niggas drop to the sound of that auto gun
I seen that O.G. gettin' up as he began to run
I grab my nine; it's time them niggas took a loss
Put on my mask, and turn the fuckin' lights off
See, speeded up, right beside, and he knew he was hit
The last words that he heard was, ""Rest in Peace, bitch""

Layzie Bone is the gangsta
And now you know it's my occupation
The jackin's in progress; it's a critical operation
The object is murder
I'm the number one assassin, it's Layzie Bone
I'll put your ass up in a casket, bitch
Be aware when I'm steppin' with the Enterpri$e
The money, we bankin'
Cause we them criminals organized
You'll take what you got, and give a shot
And so watch me pick 'em
I hunt up a sucka, and then unload on my victim
It's like, (gunshot) to his legs, (gunshots)
To his chest, another shot in the face

Open up the dime, stimulate your mind, slide my thumb up the blunt
Open up to what you find in mara....juana
I've never been in high times (lovin' them high times)
I never been in high times (but could you tell me)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)
Am I high enough (am I high enough)

I remeber being a little thug
Weed, really didn't know what it was
Then I took a puff and I realized
I should always, stay high
The weed (the weed), makes me feel alright (alright)
If you feel like i feel, I got half on your dime
If you got weed smoke it, I'm a real weed smoker
If it's mine then I would
Since its yours you could, you should
If I ain't there when you blaze a blunt n**** huh, please think of me
Cuz you know a n**** like to get high (high), high and free
Smokin' all night, feelin' all right
Bone Thugs get high, so high
High, high, all night, high, high
So high

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my my my my
I know you wonder why I do this love the sky
And I soar up so high
This mornin' I was in my bed
Bangin' and ringin' inside my head
I wanted to make love to you baby, but last night I got P-O-Ded instead
So baby don't go away, all I got to say
Is I gotta have you mary j
Such a heavenly feelin' I get when i'm taking fat a** blunts to the brain
Oh darlin i'm going insane and I wish we really can
Kick it at home in America, like it was on in amsterdam
You heard that i'm, you heard i'm, nothin' but a,realler thug n****
Nothin' less than a killa, I might if i'm makin' a scrilla
I never knew no one as live as the bone that kick as strong as me
Be rippin' the bong like me, can hit it as long as me

When I need to free my mind
I can find, satisfaction in a bag of weed
Everything I need, leave it to the trees
It can make me feel better, and everyday I wake we
Be rollin' up blunts, and mo blunts, and mo blunts
And I, keep a case of swissha sweets in the trunk
So when I'm rollin', smokin', chokin', just floatin'
Through the city in the drop top
Glock c***ed,rollin', just rollin'
Me and mary jane
That's my world, that's my thang
The way she penetrates my brain
Buddah, done blessed me with game
Good game, you wanna chop it up, we can kick it, smoke a phatty to the dome
N**** lay high, thugged out, smokin', all, night, long

I’m Gone,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ricco Barrino] (Krayzie)
Hey, wooo, ooooh, hey yeah, oooh now
If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know I’ll come back to you
For now I am gone
Gone, for now I am gone 
(For now I am gone, for now I am gone
For now I am gone, for now I am..gone )

When I’m dead and gone don’t even worry
Don’t mourn me too long death-a get ya discouraged
Keepin’ your vision blurry, prison and mentally hurtin’
I know it for certain if I’m really restin’ in heaven
No need for you to fear don’t cry
‘Cause death won’t forever have a grip on our life
So I’m-a be coming big?(bet) ready for the last shine
‘Cause I am a believer that I’ll see a resurrection
Don’t believe that I’ll burn in hell
I study the scriptures and they learn me well
No trippin’, no drippin’, no purgatory I dwell
I sleep, I rest in peace ’til I prevail
It’s just a temporary lay down I won’t forever stay down
So keep me in your memory don’t let me fade out
I’ll probably never see you at the crossroads
Guess I was wrong I’m gone, gone, long gone

If I had one wish
That wish would be clear
That I would not have to go
That I could stay here
And although it hurts me
To leave you all alone
Just know I’ll come back to you
For now I am gone

We hit the road back in 1993
Had a vision like a prophet
The project was go see
The logic was so deep
I come back and do a lotta good
I heard ya callin’ so I headed out to Hollywood
One way tickets, my niggas and no fear
Some said that we was trippin’ the mission was so clear
Don’t wanna go there, the money was over there
I still love ya ‘99, I miss ya St. Claire
Yeah, now I’m movin’ on a rollercoaster
Just ridin’ tryin’ to be Jehovah’s soldier
And I’m grindin’ tryin’ to make it better for ya
So for now I best be gone, be gone
I made a vow to change the world somehow
I’ma impact it and see it in this lifetime
On the dark road to bring back the sunshine
But for now I’m gone, I gotta go get it

If it’s out there to get
Then I’ma go and get it
Get it ’til I got nothin’ left, chasin’ better livin’
It’s a ‘tinuos mission, so I’m steady movin’
And I gotta get it in, never settle for losin’
I’m a thug true, add to or get out the way
You could settle for less but I need more on my plate
Eatin’ good, family good
Okay, ’til that day, I’m-a get up and move, move
Show my babies how the thug do, ooh
I’m-a play it like it’s my last game
If it’s due better give it up right away
‘Cause a thug niggas gonna bring pressure
See me f-cked up, starvin’ nigga never
And as long as niggas out here gettin’ paid
Back to my old ways
Who they gonna run and tell, huh?
It’s a street thang, come on

Yeah we ready, back up in ‘em
Wit nothin’ but that harmony rhythm
Hard hittin’ flows all we give ‘em
Flows that spit venom
No cop there goes the end of ‘em
Ever since the beginning we winnin’ it
Get a glimpse of legends standin’ on deck
‘Til we come, we be here holdin’ down the set
Keep on wonderin’ what the Bone ’bout to do next
Still they humble and the hungriest, God bless
The fan fam flex, all across the U.S
Overseas and Tel Aviv and back west
You know we go the hardest
No need to say we better than the rest
It’s obvious more less
Came down off my high from the wet
When I had to do a stretch
I signed so I cashed the check
Had me caught up in a game, insane
My head blown, what’s goin’ on
‘Cause ain’t nobody home",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-im-gone-lyrics

I wanna holla, I need to talk to the world
The system haters, even though sometimes we tend to do right
Well look at the news, previews of all of our troubles in life
If it ain't one thing, its another
They keep a composite of undercover
Really kind of disturbed us
They tryin to make people think that we bone thugs don't know what we do (cool)
We let 'em think that we playin the heat
And celebratin Eazy's victory, blowin my week
And well it ain't that easy, being Krayzie Bone
Temptations battlin' and persuations rattlin' my brain
Won't go insane I'm thinkin thats why they callin' me Krayzie

Be comin up missing in this rap game
After 30 million records and 7 years, ain't nothin' changed
(ain't nothin changed) And everybody wanna be like the Bone
And you can put yer radio on without you hearin' our flows
Ten toasts, to the earth
Match for everyhting its worth, til im dead and in the dirt
I'll be up there puttin in work, until it hurt (until it hurt)

We gon' ride for the niggas that didn't make it to see
The way we, do this here, Tomb Stone and Eazy E
While we ride, Niggas is probably thinkin' we nutz
Like this mission gonna self-destruct
Come again, you got us fucked up
I'm a thug by nature, 
gettin this paper be the reason
That these hustlers out of Cleveland
On the come up daily creepin
Nigga believe me, we in the house
And every time I puts it down, we turns it out

The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out, (we turn it out)
The thugs is in the house, (we in duh house)
We can't be stopped, and we turn it out, (out out out)

You know and I know they thought it would take us no where
But look at 'em thugs now we on the top, we took it right there
Thugs got what you want (want), we came for the music
We can always pop that trunk, (pump)
Everywhere we go (go), and everywhere we be (be)
Everybody recognize that B-O-N-E, man
I ain't braggin'
Man, my life's a blessin'
Lord, please hear me now, don't take it away now I learned my lesson
You can stop the hatin', but that thugster music plays on (plays on)
You can count on Bone to come and rock it till we dead gone
I know we spit that shit, and some don't like it
But bone just keepin' it real
Wrong is wrong, right is right

Cause we got cheese to spend, and I know they really don't want no trouble

Cause a Bone Thug party get wild
Get foul in the crowd like do that what? Do that shit right now

With a hundred thugs right by me, and you don't wanna try me

This nigga was ballin y'all, big house driveway full of cars
This nigga would pull up in brand new Caddies, packed-up full of broads
Bossin, flossin, all his ghetto superstar
Until some young niggas decided they was gon pull his card
And one night when he came home, they was in the bushes in his yard
As soon as he pulled up, they jumped out the bushes
And let out off they ammunation, but they didn't hit him, they missed him
(oh shit, hot damn!)
So homie ducked and rose backed up buckin off his shit
And hit one of them niggas back off in the skillet, left him with his wig-split
And one of the niggas, he dropped his GUN and started to RUN
As soon as he took one step, the nigga was DONE, DONE, he was DONE!
He took a shot to the abdomen, and as he blasted the last one
He'll survive it, but they won't be alive to tell that - thug story
Livin in the city is really, no nuts, no glory, no nuts, no glory, glory glory...

Backin them brains, deep in the hood, it still is an everyday thang, shit!
Just last week, a nigga was comin from work, to feed his kids
Got caught in the crossfire, we couldn't take the shit he did
Always the innocent feelin the losses in the ghetto
And if you're from here, you probably is a rebel!
That been through some shit, seen some shit you couldn't bear
Only a few make it out, niggas dead or in jail
I figured that I would just give you my story!
Forever I'm thuggin, it's the only thang for me!
Been shot, stabbed, kicked, punched, every night, gettin drunk
Prove I'm not a punk, sellin my llell on the first of the month
Smokin sherm, sticks and blunts, known for layin niggas down
Anything you want, I'll get it, I'mma claim the whole town
I'm a nigga, you'sa nigga, she's a nigga, we some niggas
Wouldn't you like to be a nigga too? We got some, we got some

Thug Stories, you wanna hear some thug stories?
We got some real thug stories!
You wanna hear some thug stories?
We got some real thug stories!

I gotta story for your ass...
I remember hustlin down on the corner, that's what thugstas do!
Then it got too hectic, wanted my money got all my own crew!
Why work so hard, let these other niggas stack mine up and snatch shit?
Everything was good at the few licks, but niggas got greedy, aw shit!
Recruited the law, that's when, thangs went downhill
All she had to do was swipe his keys, dump 'em and put 'em right back there
But I guess he seen her, cause we got that heat
He was waiting right there, there, waitin right there!
Shots went out, everybody runs except baby-girl
I, turn around to see your boy get one in baby girl
And we can't leave her, not like that, not like that!
But damn, I think she gone! Here come the po-pos and we scrap, scrap!
So we made our getaway, and had to lay low, law low!
But it ain't over, till one of us sees that crossroads!
But damn, carmern comes right back, comes right back
Same old niggas shot dead over six eight and craps, damn!

Sweet Jane,T.H.U.G.S.,2007.0,"Mmmmmmm Sweet Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane
I'm so in love with you Sweet Jane, Jane, Jane
Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary Mary
I'm so in love with you Sweet Jane, Jane, Jane

I never, knew love like this before, before, before
I said I never, knew love like this befoooooore
She, relaxes my mind - keeps me tired all day and night
Damn near feel like I'm fly, high
And I can't come down, don't wanna come down
Don't need to come down, down
Ooh, ooh; I'm feelin so cool, cool
Cause that's what you do, do
Sweet Jane, I'm so into you (I'm so into you)
Can't nobody tell me nothin that'll make me stop messin with you
They keep tellin me you're bad for me, it just ain't true
Believe me (believe me)
Baby I don't believe it, as long I'm with you Jane


It's such a beautiful thang when I'm just sittin back smokin
No time to worry 'bout thangs cause Mary Jane got me chokin
And I like this, feelin
Light it up and smoke one, feel me
I like to smoke it when I'm rollin, blaze it up when I'm drunk
I like to smoke it in the mornin, blaze it up when I fuck
Yeah, this is what she does for me
Ain't tryin to tell you but to me she's love-ly
She lets me know when niggas fucked up
Don't fuck wit'chu, don't fuck wit'chu
Even when the road gets tough, smoke another one
Think it through, you can think it through
And I know we got a lot of people goin through it
But talk of Mary Jane, she can sho' help you through it (this is America!)
And she, does ease the pain (pain)
But you gotta take, her, to the brain (hey, hey)


I told you before that nigga I would never stop my fiendin
All I be needin is sticky green man
When I be ridin I'm smokin and leanin, you ain't comprehendin that meanin
About the sticky, the sticky, the green leaves, leaves, leaves
Nigga you keep that brown, I want this shit with no seeds
Girl you my thaaaang
And I love the way you stimulate the brain, brain
And it ain't nothin I would change
Compliment you with a little bit of Tangueray, hey
Kray', my nigga let's ante up on a pound
You swoop up Wish and I'ma swoop up B
We can have this Thugs night on the town (town)
Let's blow this one for Flesh, fo'sho'
It's the niggas night out, the niggas night out, y'know
Hurry up and twist one, pass it on so I can hit one
And none of you busta niggas can't get none
Smokin hydroponics, got it mixed with Indonesias
So high right about now I'm thinkin I caught amnesia
But reefer really makes me happy, happy, happy
I wanna roll up some mo'

Rollin sittin on dub, dubs, nigga
But I don't have to wear no diamonds to shine
Don't need none of that cause I'm Bone, Bone

Look at me tipsy sippin on Grey Goose, finna let loose cause I can
Fuckin with people that's off in the crowd, nigga you know me, I'm the man
Cleveland, is the city, where the Thuggstaz get down
Just come to my town and ask around, they tell you who the rawest in town
Cause I'm a +Thug By Nature+, strictly for the paper
Ain't nobody steppin to Steve (B-O-N-E)
I come with the ones, I come with the guns
I come with them things that go bang
It's still an +Everyday Thang+, for me to let my nuts hang
You want a performance, where's the ticket?
If the price right we can kick it
Like a lick, I'ma hit it, party on I gots to get it
Keep them foxy women baggin it up (baggin it up)
While them haters stayin actin up (actin up)
You flashin what? I'm flashin flossy nuts
Girl if you comin take a ride with me
And if you ridin with me, sit back recline in yo' seat
Cause in the world where I'm from the sun always shine
And even though a nigga don't want it baby the world is mine, so c'mon


I'm out of my mind with the ski mask, chains and gloves
Waitin for niggas to come out of the club (I hit 'em up!)
Give me the dubs for my niggas that bang and slang drugs
We fuckin them niggas up, ain't no love for Bone Thugs?
Nigga fuck y'all! Y'all bitches used up
It's business as usual, I ain't takin no shit, from none of ya
Wanna see my niggas with no, money huh?
Since a nigga young think he rollin with dummies, oh you a sucka for
That's why I pitch ya bitch, flippin that activist of freedom
And I'm Bone Thug too, make 'em meet 'em
No podium, just a pistol and nails to leave quickly
Youngest Bone nigga, 7th Sign mastermind, y'all get wit me


We steppin inside the party, Mardi Gradi
Now give me a shot of Bacardi, let it get up in my body
Make my body body rock rock - I'm lookin at rappers so full of shit
I'ma just get up against the wall dawg and pull on my dick
Tell the DJ don't even tell 'em we in here (shhh) we on the low
No thuggin in V.I.P. for me and my niggas, we on the flo'
C'mon heyyy - we fin' to get this party started right
Could you put some Thug music on?
Like Bone Bone to get a nigga vibin in my zone, hey!
I hear the same shit song after song, man
How many times is you gon' tell us about you ballin, huh?
How many rhymes is you gon' write like that before you fall off?
That's why we back and we fin' to bomb in this bitch
Ring the alarm, better be gone when we mob up in here
So you better get with the Thugs or shut the fuck up and back up off me
And I don't need no diamonds to shine, nigga I floss me, what?

I'm sorry that I'm just so fuckin exciting
Steadily cordial like this killa 'posed to
And I wish you would really try to come test me
You break bread with niggas that know you, I can show you
Slowly rollin like these cuts from old school
Cookin it up just like it's soul food
Fuck all y'all, I never did know you
Bring the ProTools, stack it on up
And little thugs that I console to
Never leave your house without, keepin it up
To the head that is, you don't know what mad is?
Couple of bodies under my belt and with mad kids for self protectin
Don't know (bitch) and keep my hands on a little bit of solo shit

And I gets my money, I bring home the bacon
Seven or better that's what I'm makin
Better check the reputation, nigga get dealt with, frontin and hatin
See I'm polishin, plus I'm cool, yeah I'm a thug and yeah I'm a fool
I love the game and I love the rules
If you cross the line I'ma flex these two's
And nigga ooh, if I do it's for my children
If you're feelin like I'm feelin then you probably gon' see a million
Thug nation, fuck these doubters, yeah they said it, ""He'll never make it
He's runnin wild and doin this and doin that, he'll never make it""
Who gets the last laugh now, look at me now countin this money
Them the same niggas today, that can't get nothin from me

Oh, oh, oh now look it's a miracle (ain't that a bitch)
Y'all know that Bone's gon' pop, ten years and still we blow
Just admit that we rock, all night long
You know we keep it thug and still harmonize these songs (songs)
But don't get it twisted, we thug and we real with it
They feel that we flip and we deal with it
Ain't gotta like it, better live with it
Just trust me, better live with it
Now think about you when you was me wearin my shoes on yo' feet
Now think again cause that can never be
I can never be a hater with the hand that was dealt to me
And it seems like I've always been down
And I can't take that, rather take that 'fore I go back that route
You see one nigga on the news, wonderin what did he do
When they tell you, you be like, ""Ooh, that nigga's through""
But they don't know me
Been blessed with all my thugs and all this harmony
You know we can't be stopped, we rollin past the cops
Plus all you haters, the finger's all you got
Fuck y'all!

Who thought they could run up and fuck with me now in 2 thou'
We fuckin around with the convicts, breakin 'em up at the county
Now I got nothin but killas around me
Fallin in proudly, organized but rowdy
They fearin us, because of the shit they been hearin about us
They say that them niggas got ripped with the knowledge
And we got a nation of niggas screamin ""Thug Power!""
Them niggas ain't think we was comin back on some real

Get up and fuck up your rivalries, you funny you even know what time it is

""Yeah she has a gun and I went and got her a gun permit!
Now they didn't have to shoot that old lady down like that
They didn't have to do that!
It's one old woman in that house
I've got burglar bars there to try to protect her
I've got mercury lights out there to keep it bright and light
I'm as mad as hell! And somebody's gon' answer to that!""
""Police are defending the shooting death of a 92 year-old woman
It happened as plain-clothes officers burst into her home last night
To serve a search warrant for drugs
Police say they made an undercover drug buy at the house earlier in the day
The woman's niece said there were never drugs in the house
And her aunt lived alone and probably just panicked
The family is furious.""

It's so many ways to die - ohh no
It's so many ways to fly - steady as we go
It's so many ways to rise high, high
Cause life can't pass us by no mo'

Chillin on my momma's front porch, I'm watchin
Sittin here reminiscin on how hot the block gets
From right here I can truly see how crooked the cops is
My vision gettin blurry as I look at my options
I could, just let 'em drop me or I could cock it and pop it
The way they murdered Oscar was preposterous nonsense
They talkin with their Glocks, conversation is violence
And they wonder why society is criminal-minded
They never gon' change, come around my way
Another one shot down slain while the cop got praised
It's hard to maintain when they supposed to protect us
You or me could be the next one bleedin injustice

Even though the world shows no affection (no affection)
You gotta keep it movin, got to keep on steppin (got to keep on steppin)

It's very necessary, you remember this is temporary (temporary)

Time's tickin all day, let me swoop up in yo' neck of the woods
Everybody tend to they own hustle, got much respect, that's all good
Turn on the news it's no surprise to see
Police brutality and worse they out here gunnin us down in the street
Abuse of authority ain't even it
Rather the vast majority of 'em is too damn incompetent
When is enough gon' be enough I ask
I know we all tryin to live life free from all the madness
It's sad enough you gotta watch out or get jacked
But the worst one's the criminal that's hidin behind the badge
You got a problem it may be a waste of time to call 'em
Cause the only thing they bringin is more problems so why bother?

Political think I'm illiterate, literal me I get so cynical
It's pitiful livin in minimal, general's animals stick with their tentacles
I'm more alive, I'm just tryin to fight evil
Me and my people, my people and me, I'm still single
And even though I look meager I'm eager to make some money
My heart is more than a direction, my protection from dummies
Hold your hand like babies, feel my hand gettin stuck
Josiah acted a fool, Rasu, 7th Sign, what...

I'm lookin around the world, my temporary city it makes my heart hurt
Feelin the struggles of my brothers it takes some hard work
Bein raised by single mothers the case was caught first
And they got daddy in the pen, gotta face the law's worst
No guidance we dyin, we barely survivin, the knowledge is there, they ain't providin
They starvin us out to keep us divided so they can get money and hide it
Operation Silence, the government got some secrets they ain't tellin
Cause if they let you know they can't convict you felon
But they done slipped and let the Thugs know the deal
We comin back to save the ghetto, let the truth be revealed

So Many Places,T.H.U.G.S.,2007.0,"I've been so many places (all around the world)
So many unfamiliar faces
Ohhh I pray every day (every day, every day)
To keep from goin crazy

Well what do ya know? We still here
But we still strugglin tryin to come up on that almighty dollar
Do the damn thang and I've got to maintain, try not to go insane
Every day, I'm facin compilations
Motions I've been in the gauge, temptations of the faith
Snake in the grass
I'm keepin my eye on y'all, won't let nobody hold me back
I never did figure that in my life that it could be this real
Never did figure that bein a rapper would be so hard, oh God
But now that I'm seein the light
As soon as I open my eyes for the first time I realize I gotta die
And life don't last forever
And fast livin make you crazy if you, suck up too much
Trust me, I done seen enough (seen enough)


Done hustled all through this world, I'm really not doin it for fun
Don't worry about me {?} a hand I see, I take it and run
And maybe we can chill out, hit a couple of yo' spots
Have some we can pass out, if not, bye-bye
Cause I got another show, some {?} up for dough
Need to borrow my thugs, some {?} and then we blow
And then it's on the next CD
Thugs get it all then it's easy, one of you got it then I know you feel me
That's why you gotta get your hustle, on
Everybody get the money, yeah
Got the money, reach for thousands, mmm
Got them thousands, reach for millions, y'know


Now I done traveled around the globe
Witnessed some things that I wouldn'ta seen
Me and my team chasin green
Runnin this Earth, tryin to live our dream
What I've seen would make the average person, run, quit and hide
And you know I'm down for the ride, I had to choke it and swallow my pride
I hate to admit it but dawg I love my material thangs was what I was after
Who woulda thought about bein a rapper? All of the coaches I captured
I got, caught in the rapture, assumed it was written
Keepin women, poverty stricken
It seems like the whole world's takin a strippin
I don't know why, and I don't know what it is
All the crazy thangs I done did brought me closer to my kids
No more bailin by my lonely, that story but I'm thorough
Me and my dogs runnin this planet, it's just us against the world, c'mon


You niggas don't really know me, not one of my homies wanna control me
Control these nuts, I'm goin home
Come and hold me, you get one of the twins to come and fold me
Hallelujah! Only one, sacred and holy
Phony love, how they givin it only
One of them choked, thick black billie clubs with LAPD whuppin on me
Yo' bitch was strippin down in San Diego
She only in it for the money, but we all in it for somethin though
And she really loved Tony, some thick-dicked yellow nigga
He lived in the basement and he sell weed to the drug dealers
Been around the hood and now you're motherfuckin eyed
Rather die than to be caught up in deception and lies, word to the wise",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-so-many-places-lyrics

Young homie think before you shoot murder a
Where will our children go when there's no place (no where)anywhere they can go
And trouble may come in sometime you get pulled
Over by one time and when its 1999 the one didn't even make any stride
Murder a all around the whole world is nausiatin', everybody overrated why everybody's actin' agitated I thought we graduated back in the sat away up on the battle station (oh yeah)
Patience is a birth defect and ain't and when the curtains
O's open up the door no more, no more

See we losing this world we love and it looks like the sin that won't end
So I'm reaching high up above lord let your blessings begin
And lets change the world 

You got me to set off the ride,ridin' with my troops help get united got the results
And be thorough up to my Phillies my nigga let me hear the niggas we thuggin' immortalized
Lets get high its the nigga you most desire
I can remember from way back in the day coming out the ghetto
Was a hell of a struggle for selling a phi-j-yo
When it was my dream to keep the flow to put my people on another level
Now could it be for the lust(lust)
Now could it be for the rush(rush)
My niggas love when the bust(bust)
They said they buck and you duck(duck)
They put yo dick in the dust(dust)
My niggas ppep in the come on, nigga killa(killa) thuggish ruggish nigga(nigga)

Life without satin hatin'on our enemies together let change the the world


Everyday the devil at me and I wish the lord threw a hummer at me I ain't happy
Me and Easy-E'n the B-E-N-Z wit my niggas right next to me it my legacy
We can't let it stops UH-UH not now
The whole world heading up a buck-buck pile
Corruption, destruction, disaster everybody
Tryin'nah rap faster than the master
Oh lord can you save my soul nigga tryin' no go platinum
'round forty-years old the lord knows we can do this shit
Ain't no stoppin' us know cause we can do this shit
Nigga me Snoop D Speed be Freaky G the whole world
Want to be rap wit me I'm in the flesh let's talk about sex
Babies having babies generation x with the A's at beginning
We ain't cool no more and I know they got a key for this shit we ain't rich
First we lost Easy then we lost Pac
Biggy got killed when this shit gonna stop everybody want to know what going on
In the thuggish ruggish bone, bone, bone, bone trying to be prepared for the Y2K
And if I die today I'm trying to change the world

Change the world 
And lets change the world 

And even if you do the love of rappin'
But they trying to ban it realize it ain't going to happen
We done change the world evil forces being heard
And said get yo guns better arm your selves most I'll ever do is
Because I want to do don't you notice government
And vote for me and you I have a dream (no)
I have a wish if we can't save ourselves then lets save the kids
Let the the world go on, let these babies have some
Let the world go on, just don't blow this motherfucker up

X2
Verse 1
Krayzie
As im walkin past the casket
Nigga tryin' to keep from collapsing
Never realizing how drastic man this is tragic
We done lost another soldier to the streets
And another﻿ friend of me
He went to a better place so they say
Im really not feeling the vibe of dying no time soon
But if God is willing
When i repent from my sinning
Peace so i'm living forgiven
This for (?) he ain't lookin' too good
He took the toughest fall of all
Murda murda murda murda murda
So rest in peace (Rest in peace)
Tombstone you know I got your babies
And they safe with me (Safe with me)
We're running up to the cemetery
Eyes very teary
Wearin black khakis suits and black boots
Got gats too
Wanna put in some work
But damn it hurts
To see a family member covered with dirt
Man thats the worst
When I die
I want all my mother fuckers to rise
And on my tombstone
Just write this nigga here was live
CHORUS
X2
Ayo these streets got me stressed
But I been a soldier since birth
The way my people is dying off
You got me thinking i'm cursed
So I just pray to the Lord
To help me take the pain away
Please forgive me for my sins
And let me live another day
And dog, I'm reminiscing on the things we done
It seems the moment you died
My little nephew became my son
Dad, before you died I always wanted to apologise
Now I look in my momma face
It just makes me want to cry
Loraine? one love
You been my nigga for years
But who woulda ever thought
That I would have to shed you tears
But only God knows why
And he's the one with the answers
Pop, I swear we'd be kicking it
If there was a cure for cancer
And Clinton thug, peace
I pour my liquor for y'all
And the day that I die
I'm gon' be looking for y'all
I never take life for granted
I be a thug for life
And my spirit is so tough
You got to murda me twice
CHORUS
X2
The average life span's between
Zero and seventy the year was 2000
A whole line of niggas was heavenly
Dyin' in they sleep
Let's talk about niggas who died on they feet
No surrender, no retreat
Who runnin' (who?)

Tha iron is fine dogz in slacks in tha breezes?

No Luv 4 The Law,The Lost Files,UnKnown,"If you can accept it, you will leave those state troopers gluttered with their own barbarity
If you can accept it, you will do something that will transform conditions here
So I'm not worried this afternoon
However dark it may be
However difficult it may be
I know that it is true
The truth forever on the scaffold
Wrong forever on the throne

I been tryna to gather my niggas for battle
We outta control, we can't be handled
We sick of police and they scandals
Forty-four magnums, bustin' it random at 'em
In the middle of the chaos, I'ma be bustin' my shit at the mayor
If you get caught up with nothin' to save ya, gauges spray and break ya down no where
In front of the pack and I'm orderin' niggas to point it and shoot it
If it ain't black owned then we loot it
Burn this bitch, let's do it
We ain't marchin', we ain't talkin'
We keepin' our eye on the target
So as soon as the shit get started, we gon' pop-pop-pop-pop that body
Them po-po don't want beef, they want this war out on the streets with me and my T-H-U-Gs
Bitch, you freeze
You under arrest and you got the right to die
And guess who's pullin' the switch? And I can't wait to see you fry

Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs

Today, it's time to stop singin' and start swingin'
You can't sing up on freedom, but you can swing up on some freedom

I never did have no love for the system
Man, them laws ain't built to protect me
I'm just a nigga tryna live the American dream
But you wanna arrest me and for what?
Because I'm shinin', blingin'?
Mad because I rhyme and sing?
Got too much money, got too many guns?
Your pitiful life ain't got no meanin'
And I know you steamin'
L-Burna done got legit now
Bitch, you sit on the ground, you get on the ground
You ain't talkin' that shit now
Wanna spit rounds?
You know the cop'll bring the regime and helicopters
Strapped with TECs and nines, for what's in the sky, I got a grenade launcher
Ain't nothin' to do today, so what I'ma do?
I'ma bust on the cops
Shoot the street light out on the block, dial 9-1-1 sit back and watch
I can hear them sirens comin'
I'ma teach these foo's not to fuck with me
And the outcome was a catastrophe
Do this once a week until my brother's free

Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs

United we stand, divided we fall for the same bullshit like snipers on White House lawns
On that good shit
Niggas from Compton to Africa on that thug shit
Reginald Denny, no comment
I lost my blood with the gat that Carlos gave us, Lord
I can't love shit as the fullest extent is given
I'm above these deceptions, I know they intentions
With swords made by Smith & Wesson
Pulla me weapon, embrace in the Lord
Feel the spiritual resurrection through my pores
On the souls of the allies of war
No college scholarships, just calibers and clips
On the block warriors plottin' on kingpin licks
Flip burgers, I just can't see it
We gon' face more green with Bone Thugs in one night, no secret
Fuck the Feds, it ain't no love at all for 'em
They pull me over with police dogs lickin' my scrotum

Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs

Since a young thug, couldn't tell me nothin'
Ya fuck up, I shed blood, gotta leave this world with somethin'
A realer nigga, no more than I can handle
The drugs was at  a Mac, got caught up in a scandal
Police ain't right and we ain't either
Everybody want somethin' equal
Listen up my people
We gotta get down, get down for right now
Nigga, fuck your beeper
And this is how we are
Our dream to get paid
Gotta think he's one of a kind, he's better than everybody, destroyin' dreams
But don't you listen, we can rise above it, above it
Nine times outta ten, nah, fuck that, 'cause they gon' love it
Quit fuckin' wit' my people
Wonder why we react
We strong, need to be left alone (Yeah) and that's a fact

Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs
Got no love for the law, but I shed blood for my dawgs",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-no-luv-4-the-law-lyrics

The bigger the nigga the quicker get showed up. Let's swerve to the burbs, set up a hold-up, so many bodies me blowed up. Nuts, bucks, and guts, niggas mistakin' they balls for dogs. All niggas'll get mauled, no thang to pick up a pump and flip on all y'all. And they'll never hold-up especially when them roll, stop!. Bet I bringin' in them guns, run, a thug get low down. You don't wanna get nutted, 'cause nigga you gonna get bloody (bloody) once you see the braids and skully. Cuttin' that throat when I'm rippin' up somethin' lovely. What is it in you, deeper than dead? And we get fried. P.O.D.'d when a ganksta ride, creep, but you sleep and then fall in the night. Once inside forgettin' about remorse. Your curse will ride. Cry now when you're ready to lie down. When I'm weak in a mental state, somebody gonna die, now
Meanwhile, swerve to the burbs

Man, he just...all of a sudden, just jumped out of the window. I didn't know what was goin' on. I'm just walkin' by. Just got a—bought a bottle of wine. I was walkin' by, and all I seen was him jump when that lady yelled. (That was it.) I'm not sure what happened
Well, I saw his wife begging him, and she said, ""Don't jump."" And he did...wheeeeeew
Did you know the guy?
He sure had a problem. That's all I could tell you
All I seen was them put the lady in a police car and take her away, I guess it was his wife",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-when-i-die-lyrics
Stand Not in Our Way,Thug Stories,2006.0,"Stand not in our way, stand not in our way
Beelzebub; Get behind us, behold the Yahweh x4

I'm tryin'to resist all this temptation that I've been facing lately
Constantly praying that I can make it and keep on shakin' Satan
It's drivin' me crazy cause he makin' the plate look oh so tasty
Then again, I'm knowin' that it's only Yahweh that can save me
Livin'in this world today It's really gettin harder to stay awakened
But I'm not tryin' to get caught too drowsy cause I know we're waitin
Just contemplatin' on my situation
Hopin' that my desperation eventually breaks my concentration
But I'm waitin' cause I'm aware that it's a snake in the grass
Can't wait for God to free us, we can scream it at last
Now oh my God, God, God! God of my God, God, God
(Now, oh my God, God, God...) Steady all day


As long as the Lord got my back
I won't be afraid of the evils around me when they surround me
I drop to my knees and I pray to the Lord proudly
Probably, these trials and tribulations in front of my face
Is a test so I be standin' firm in my faith
Stand not in my way, stand not in my way '
Cause I'm a soldier ready for Armageddon, prepared for my day
Make no mistake-stake-stake stake;
These bells above, they never break-break-break
You hear the alarm; We're headed for ruin
This world is so wicked;
Controlled by the superpowers, the Federal Government
They' wagin' these wars for this oil, actin' like they love it
We rise above it cause they can't deny the truth
And the truth is to the youth; Better strap on your boots


Everyday's a replay; We always facin' evil people
Some have them wicked ways, some donate they lives
Just to make us not equal
And oh, my Lord I want to make it welcome in your home
But I must demand forgiveness cause I done did so wrong
I gotta make a stand in my way, whatever I gotta do
I'll do it; Lord, just show me the way
So I pray, yes for me, and all my peeps in here that don't believe
It's hard to seein' what we see, but you got to
Just let it begin and you will feel that faith inside you
Never alone, always right beside you
Every time something goes wrong

Into the Future,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Bone...

And hear that raw shit, we blow these motherfuckers
And never obeyed the law bitch
Ever get noticed all you other niggas are frogs
Got skeletons in your closet
Wanna be blowed away wit a gauge
I be rotten 'til pieces they shattered
Niggas they scattered they testin like bullets they gather up
How many murdered? Don't matter
In this rap shit, you got to come with it
Can't fake the funk at all
And bet you're gon' fall studyin the Bone Thug style
But what'cha gon' do when you face to face with the 5th Dog?
Sneakin federals get wet I'ma predator to reap
No mercy those sleep where my niggas creep
And remember they +Crept and They Came+ with Eazy
Can't calm me down, give me a pound smoke and a bong
Just too damn greedy see these
Wanna be these G's just cause of our thug mentality
It'll be casualties, face that gorilla with a nigga torqued at you
Niggas who slippin I'm comin to get you
Die they flat on their backs, collapsed perhaps
You shoulda knew when you came through
You fucked with a nigga too deadly
Haters all try to come fuck with the gust
Well wanna test these nuts G you ain't ready
But do what'chu gotta do, rob you fools
I'll toast to the Grim Reap' soon
Nigga motherfuck 'em don't trust 'em
I'll buck 'em in the gut and shoot you too

Now you can hate us all day
We ain't leavin no way, we changed the whole game
We brought you into the futurrrrre, from the 9-9
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Well it's the niggas, the niggas
The killas that's raised 'round sin
Niggas they try to contend but know they can't win
When I'm breakin Flesh up outta the pen
Gimme the Henn' and gimme the gin
Ready to put in my work again
Nigga better watch it you got it
I'm poppin quick for the dividends
I'm in it to win it, the rest of these rappers
They shit is on pause, got too many flaws
These niggas is soft, they lyrics is false
The reason I'm comin to break 'em off
Gotta get mine so I'm takin yours
Wishin they never did open the door
I'm kickin it through, bitch get on the floor
Knowin they never gon' talk no more, hoes
Original niggas, that's right
We always been down for the murda mayne (mayne mayne mayne)
I'ma come back to serve the game
Break 'em on down and hurt 'em mayne (mayne mayne mayne)
I never give no mercy, mercy
After 35 million still thirsty, thirsty


Now y'all know niggas been here
Ever since we was runnin around with Eazy-E
They was like, ""Who was these little niggas
Talkin all of that shit from the Cleveland streets?""
They ain't nothin like these and we never had beef
Cause we was a different kind of breed
Beef with a nigga you bleed, fuckin with Bone
Been blowin some weed and singin my song, ho (ho)
My nigga that's Krayzie, Layzie, Wish, Flesh
Wanna bet we the all time best?
The force of the rhythm we give 'em
Is similar to a sawed-off pump hittin your chest
Rippin your vest, listen to that
You know when we comin for trouble
Cause we got 'em barrels that's runnin up on you
Ain't none of you ready for murder to bubble
I'ma pump and still I defeated them all
They was all schemin, thinkin we'd fall
Then all of a sudden we got up and balled again
Now you can't witness the hearts of men
The game was down to help it survive
We blew through like fresh oxygen
And I got my 9-millimeter cocked again
You thug niggas is not my friend


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
When we crept wasn't nothin like this
Had to be different so we came with a twist
Straight from the streets where the niggas get rich
Better find a pattern 'til you see who it is
Livin is hard, make soldier grow
And see what it is, take over (take over)
Who knew the Thugs true?
We bring it through for the 2-1-6, we in this!
Put it down make you feel this
We don't fuck around, Thugs get down
Nigga ask around, from the center we flip
Thuggstas equipped, prepared to make any niggas wig split
Lawyers on our payroll, so I never stay long
Back out, lay low, no ain't go so I stay gone
Thuggin it down to the law they at me
Lookin at a thug keepin it raw I got you
Fuckin with me wrong one, look what happened
Thuggstas got it, Thuggstas got it
We on the same thang, make change, make change
Repay if you gotta do your thing
Better him than me, okay
It's like that around my way (my way)
Better hit than dead they say (they say)
You don't want to see that grave (that grave)
So watch your back while you on that grind
Move forward, no rewind - watch niggas all the time
Cause they want your spot
They want your spot, nigga fuck that! (that)",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-into-the-future-lyrics

Kelly, I believe I can fly/ And plus, around me I can’t see, my vision’s clouded/ Premeditate em or bust, and please label me ‘bout it, ‘bout it/ As I collect my thoughts, take me a breath/ God bless my homie Niggo, he took one in the chest/ And yes, but he still here to rap a song, just another day/ While ya bullshhh, crack the top on that Alize (Alize)/ Cause we don’t play in this land of the loc’s, where brothers, they smoke trees up with dust, and see, they bleed/ Then they plead/ Cause I’m on top, straight ballin/ Makin’ love to my woman, but my music’s steady callin’, and never stallin/ But it comes to me, you should please let me have prophecy, yes, I make love to my music/I’m makin’ love ...
I love music/ Any kind of music, as long as it’s pumpin’ to keep me thuggin self in check/ Maintain the mentality I got to keep my composure, and music’s the perfect potion/ When I’m coastin’ roll a blunt up, roll ‘em up/Put some of them jams on (And jam on)/ And, nigga, we zonein’, so put on some old school, homie, let’s hit the dance floor/ Music really makes me happy/ When I’m stressin’, mental hot, I put on some instrumentals/ Stop, I think about what I done been through/ I put it to paper, then put it to wax, and kick some facts, sit back and relax, now everything is all right/ If it wasn’t for this music, I’d be dead, fuck a jail, ‘cause a nigga ain’t never goin’ back to that hell/ Feel me, kill me/ And if it wasn’t for the man upstairs blessing me with talent, like the average thug nigga, would I vanish?

The hustle is really in me so money we makin plenty
'Bout the skills and the bills, still collectin for the thrill
So ill with the real I just tell the beat to chill


My niggas we at you on a do or die mission, it's about to get ugly for you
We threw the bait and they took it, now since they hooked
Flesh gon' gut 'em up somethin lovely and serve one hell of a platter
Worse than a natural disaster, they should've expected this chapter
But, there's no way to prepare plus the game ain't ready for it
Them original thugs got somethin'll shut all you bitch niggas up
Trust the facts don't lie, Stack about to take flight
No tellin how long that ass gon' nap when I cut off your fuckin light switch {*bzzt*}
... Shakin you niggas up with each medley
So heavy it's deadly, still the rawest to rip a melody
Fresh off the main line, from the pen and county
Right back to the block, no matter where we at we holdin it down G

Some of you niggas got soldiers, how many you got that'll leave with a hole in 'em?
Wanna lay back, won't stress that, then pop a cold one
Huh? Like fuck it - ain't too many that can walk in my shoes
I never think lose, I do my part with a lot of heart (heart)

Yeah

We're streamin' live online for the world to see
It ain't me young G, your girl all on me
She chose me when she seen your boy buy out the bar
Told her, ""Drink 'til you drop lil superstar""
Better chill, be cool homie, grab a drink
'Cause you don't wanna play big bank take little bank
We at The Palms where it ain't no drama
Hugh Hef' thugged out, wearin' Layzie pajamas
House coat, pure silk, party hard for days
Pretty girls up in here wearin' Lay-gerie
It's my brand new line, hot damn you fine
Picture perfect from behind, sippin' a glass of wine

Got you dancin' on the bar (Let's do it, let's do it)
Let's take this party to my hotel suite (Let's do it, let's do it)
Yeah

In the limousine bus, black tint windows
Smashin' on the diesel, head rush from the indo
Vegas, they say what goes on there stays
If you really tryna gamble, shake 'em up and roll my way
Nobody rock the way a Bone Thug show
We get it in overtime but they already know
Break out the money then we headed for the exit (Exit)
Ain't no tellin' what we 'bout to get next in (Next in)
I'm on my tip-toes, steady I be floatin
Coastin', holdin' somethin' that I'm sippin' on slow (Slow)

Bartender, let me get a shot of Henny, make it double
Mix a lil gin with it, go on, get me on the level
I see you girl, lookin' at me, lookin' at you
Feelin' your drink, and feelin' me too
It's the physical attraction baby, what can we do?
She want a little thug passion, roughness, harassment
Drink a little mo', while I drink a little Mo'
Let's get tipsy and forget where these feelings is finna go
To the room, that's where I'm tryna guide 'em to
And yo I roll with them, but I can ride with you

Table full of drinks from the bar, come closer
Make our way through, top shelf and we're blowin
Don't worry 'bout your business gettin' out there girl
Come here, grown man, put some thug in yo' ear
You're drop-dead gorgeous, sip 'til we nauseous
And then we're gonna bounce, bounce, shake 'em
Room with a pool, just one rule, get naked

Women in the club, they focusin' on the gentleman

We hit the dance floor, dance floor, dance floor
Take me to the medic, pack liquor to where we headed
You could read it right before that they set it to end the rhetoric
The veteran, the gentleman, the warrior, the better man
And Bizzy's just a thug gettin' fucked up, get it?
Safe sex, never ever with the same sex (Eww)
Yeah, we at Vegas (Hey), spend it like wild Roulette
Free drinks, hundred thousand dollar chips
Leanin' back in the whip on the night-life strip

When I'm sleepin these niggas be creeping
Sceamin' spend a lot of times you peeped 'em
Seen 'em when I was day dreamin niggas say screamin
Some of your friends intend to just ?
Niggas befriend simply because they think I'm rich
Take my kindness for weakness
Even if I slip up you bring up the real quick
Just like mama used to say
Don't let any of them niggas block your way
Cuz every body ain't your friend
A lot of these niggas just fake pretend
And they'll bring it to an end
So thats why I loved you for lovin me back
I never worried bout the real cuz I know
What its got ?
You the reason I'm cool when shit get hot


Yea, I can admit it
If it wasn't for you
Then I would still be
Out here livin' wreckless
So I respect it
When you see the drama you check it
I got your back theres no question
You such a blessin, so helpin
I call you my secret weapon
Girl, you can spot these blanks
From a mile away these fake smiles
They can keep on steppin
You the best in the business
Investigatin', on point
When I'm stackin my bread
For real you can see the whole field
You the eyes in the back of my Head
And I know get stubborn some times
And I don't wanna listen
But this is the truth
This rhyme that I'm writin here got me excited
Cuz this dedicated to you


Not only is the lovin good
But you hold me down
Like a real woman should
Can't nobody do it like you
Thats why beside me
Its always gonna be you
I really do would do it do it
Anything yes fo'ya fo'ya
Not on that level won't nothin
Ever get in between us never
You was here before I had any paper
So I know whats yours and chances are lady
Lady if I had to do it all again, I'd chose you
I ain't shit with out my best friend

That it wouldn't last

Gotta struggle, gotta hustle, gotta do what I do
(Even though I'm makin moneyyyyy)
{Gotta do what I, do what I do}
Gotta struggle, gotta hustle, gotta do what I do

And I believe, that we must confront the past
In order to capitalize on the future
Because in our present times and turmoils, it is inevitable
So focus, did you hear what I said?
I said focus, on our children
We must, concentrate on education, and pride
Not only mental development, but physical development
So that we can stand united, and kick our enemies ASS! (that's right)
Can I get a witness?
Now time is of the essence, so stand tall, chest out, chin up
Be proud to be a part of this nation of thugs
And remember one thing, that the clock is tickin!


First off, I wanna know, how many people really believe in the Lord?
Because if you don't, I think you need to start headin for the exit
Because what I'm 'bout to say is just real, it's too real
Like me and my dogs Bone Thugs, you know what I'm sayin?
Hey! Why every time we get mad
I mean when we get mad, why we tear up our own SHIT?
That don't make no damn sense!
We gotta get it together, you know what I'm sayin? Wooo!
I think I'd do anything for my babies cause I love my children
I brought them here, I give them, I feed them, and they mine
And we bringin you the Thugs nation
An organization of nothin but thugs, nothin but THUGS!
We are, we are, the Thug, nation!


Soldiers! All praise is due to the creator, first and foremost
I would like to read to you out of the book of Babylon
Chapter one, it is written in Braille
What you feel tonight is not just anger my children (yeah!)
It is not just oppression (yeah!)
It is not confusion, it is solution (yeah!)
The same ghetto in which we have been institutionalized in
Has become our training camps
And the minister of defense is here to you tonight
To tell you that the target is no longer our brothers and sisters (yeah!)
It is no longer our children (yeah!)
Tonight is not the beginning, it is the rejuvenation of a revolution
The revolution that our mothers and our fathers have abandoned us (yeah!)
So I will struggle with you, I will take council with you (yeah)
I will eat with you
And may God be with all of his soldiers
I said, may God be with all of his soldiers! (YEAH!)
But without the creator then this isn't possible
Without further adieux, I bring to you, Chief LeathaFace (yeah)
My friend, and your chief

Now where my thugs at?
I said, where my goddamn thugs at?! (Right here nigga!)
Now what we tryin to organize here today
Is more than just a gang of niggas
We tryin to organize more than just a posse of niggas
We tryin to organize a goddamn army

Now we them niggas gon' keep it real
While these other bitch niggas keep it fake
We gon' let them motherfuckers know what's goin on down here
In the goddamn streets; can I get a ""Hell yeah"" (hell motherfuckin yeah!)
... Now I gotta say, the mission is to make money
The enemy is the police, Mr. Fed, Mr. CIA (fuck the Feds!)
Mr. Wanna-See-Yo'-Thug-Ass-in-Jail (fuck that)
I think it's time we start patrollin the police
And let them see how it feels, to be up under surveillance
Let them see how it feels, to have THEY phone tapped
Let them see how it feels
To have a strange guard inside yo' motherfuckin house

Two witnesses just died for fuckin' with my mind
Now that's way before I thought reduction, I was crushin niggas' spines

Swingin' on Thug Queen, she was down to ride
Word to Capo, s-s-s-seven shots, one to the dome

Little niggas on powder, that's crack to me
From my old days, a little clam chowder, hey, for my old ways

No acting, that's a fact
Since God wrote the script it's all real
If you can't face reality pop a pill
They say these kids trying to kill my character
It's hard enough trying to survive in America
Hate to be a visionary, ordinary
This is historical

It’s Still Love,Still Creepin on ah Come Up,2008,"Yes indeed
We thank God for the opportunity, and the grace, in this New World Order
Nine nine nine nine nine, yes indeed
As we learn precious gifts and 
mosiac law
And the sons of Aaron sing
We are men, we are men

Okay, we keepin the Sabbath holy
And okay, we have to recognize the Lord's homies
And okay, ashes to ashes, dust to dust and plus the bust must be love
It don't matter if you Crip or you Blood, you still loved
Uh-uh, we keepin the Sabbath holy
And okay, we have to recognize the Lord's homies
And okay, ashes to ashes, dust to dust and plus the bust must be love
It don't matter if you Crip or you Blood, it's still love, uh-huh

When the dark side turns into light
And grown men get shookin lookin, they scared of the night
And mother-errt keep a pistol in they pocket for protection
Can't shoot invisible forces, keep the courses of that, resurrection
Have you ever been hurt or lied with nails from Jinn?
Have you ever been raped, and raped, and raped again?
Have you ever been beat in yo' sleep for fightin the devil?
Have you ever been lonely, alone, but still on that level with God?
There's never a problem, say my prayers like Abel
At least as close as I can, little brother's a rebel
A new label, couple of dollars, pay my bills and we bounce
If it, wasn't for Jesus I wouldn't be known, no doubt
For all whose in attendance, remembrance and love
I said it hurts to be couped and cool, like a dove
I said it's simple to crush your amp, but it's much simpler to sway
We was taught to be kind and humble and stay, out of the way


There are many things that are sacred and many things that we cherish
As I write this I'm being so careful to not be careless
Where's the only begotten? B is with me
I speak to him and he speaks with me when everyone is leavin me
But, we've gotta have fun, without the presence I'm hurt
I'm ready for work, and I'm tryin, we can all change the world
Here's what I pray, here's the garden, we need some special attention
And not to mention we can party with the best of 'em, best of 'em
Rest of 'em beautiful too, please {?} do
Young Islamic brother, you with Christ, the world is cool
Do what, ever the Lord tells you, and the reward is good
Even if you have to live back in the hood, and shake your wood


I'm walkin with the only begotten, never forgotten
Shed tears for mistakes that I've made, so dirty rotten
I'm not a king, never was, I'm just a slave and a servant
I love the light and I shall pass, angels, closed curtains
New king, tribe of Benjamin, help me succeed
I'm star rockin Abraham, somebody please take the lead
So wherever Jesus go, I follow because I love him
On the right hand of granddad and none is above him
All the brothers in the temple teach me right in the struggle
I can't imagine not existin at least, for a couple
It's trouble in these muddy waters, everyone know
Probably the stitches certain levels, love yourself and now grow
I see impatient truly help you make you rich and successful
So many people need a spirit, and this world is a cesspool
Test you, bless you, love you, address you

Let it all go, let ya self go, let it all go 

My Lord! First breath - He was there! So don't just call Him when you get scared!

Help me to save me from myself

Yeah! You seem to be into livin'. Lord willin'!

What a feelin'! What I'm buildin' is for my children

You can't pray enough for peace in the world from the warfare
And unless you felt the struggle then you probably won't care

Poor health care! Senate killin' 'em with welfare
Ghetto-black babies, no daddys, who cares? Anybody there?

So we patiently wait for this great tribulation!
Pray for the day we get that better situation
Still I'm lookin' for my brighter day, brighter day
- Chorus -

How many churches never did mention the Ascension? Baby let it go..
I'm in the trenches, never did mention the Ascension! Baby let it go...

'Cause it's never you're time to go until you're scheduled

Everybody's ballin', sundown 'til sunup flossin'

Ten years gone and we ridin' (ridin') just for you

Tonight's the night that I close the bar, shakin this life ain't hard to do
I sit and I stare from across the room, contemplate drinkin all this Goose
After that it be Absolut, I did what I thought I had to do
My book told me I had no clue, I guess I was {?} have to view
Chasin cash and livin fast is the only way that I know
And up until now I had no doubts, I thought it was I say go
Livin the fly way so long, on the highway hold on
How did my way go wrong? But it's Friday so gone (pour me a drink)
I'm finna indulge a bit cause real life on some other shit
When I had it they loved them gifts, it's fucked up how the game'll shift
Explain to me, why everythang wanna change on me, it's plain to see
When I was up you was down for me, gotta have a drink 'fore it's time to sleep
Gotta be around the beat, cause music is poppin with plenty of action
Pretty women and Hennessy, the beautiful ones that's keepin it crackin
Even though they dimes, you the only one on my mind
Even though they dimes, you the only one on my mind girl


I struggle to bubble so make me a double
I promise bartender I won't give no trouble
I know I'm a rebel that been on the hustle
It's really no worries, ain't facin no muscle
And I don't wanna argue, so do somethin to make me feel better
I promise this stuff right here, really do make me chill better
Live better, act smart, I ain't trippin out cause I got heart
Drink the whole fifth without flippin out, that right there now that's art
And plus I'm already in trouble for some real drama
And plus this life I lead got me thinkin about my lil' mama
She won't return my calls...
She won't return my calls, y'all
I'm startin to wonder if she love me at all
Startin to question if she love me at all
Cause I've been callin, callin..
And I've been dialin, dialin..
This club is too crowded, crowded..
It feel like I'm drownin, drownin; tryin to get the fuck up out it",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-rollin-drinkin-lyrics

Take a second to stradle the fence
Let me tell you about what you been missin
Ain't a damn thang (damn thang) are you thinkin the grass is greener?
Like a nigga just lost his first love, singin ""Have you seen her?""
Tossin high beams, chasin pipe dreams
Lookin for shit that really ain't there
I mean it is what you make it my nigga, you better just stay on your square
Down here, killers and theives, pimps and pushers is on the prowl
If they find you out of your element, they'll pick you out of the crowd
Thang to do is face the music, take a stand for yo' position
Nigga get up, better stand up, man up in yo' position
Never have no mercy for them niggas that's not applyin theyself
And shit ain't perfect so you gotta make it work for yo'self
You catch them coward niggas runnin, duckin, lookin for help
But the realist niggas in the game, play the cards they was dealt
Me, myself, I got some issues; I ain't dealin with yours
Everybody got they own drama, rich or they poor
 - repeat 2X

They gave me the 25 with the L, I'm in my jail cell
It feel like a movie, I'm gettin so woozy from the stale smell
Bailin, breathin Hell's air
My first day here - I had to get down with a nigga
That thought I was some kinda faggot, I had to show him no hoes stay here
Havin to die, it is my main fear
Why did I have to kill that man? I should've never let my anger build
Now my state of awareness keeps me wishin I was thinkin
Should have reason I didn't really mean to stop the boy from breathin
I was awake last night, real late last night
Cause I heard some nigga screamin, gettin raped last night
I did the crime, but I wasn't thinkin about me doin the time
These 6-by-9's, is about to make me lose my mind
Trapped in these closed walls - ain't had no conversation
With my family on the outside cause they won't except my phone calls
After a couple of years of sheddin tears, my heart is stone hard
Believe I'm ready for war and on guard
 - repeat 2X

I've been shot, grew up without my pops
In the hood round block seen niggas shot
Got rid of them thangs, tryin to chase them knots
Cause I had to have it, knew niggas that's lookin for where my stash at
Watchin my back, puttin up ready for niggas that wanna check that
And I can't keep it kind, if you puttin in work
And your dreams is just like mine
Wake up in cold sweats, regrets about what I thought was lies
I can see me not doin that
But I did it, we live it, the hood shows you no slack
And believe it, there's no, no-no, comin back
Make money, think you're on that
Just ridin through the hood, you might have to push your wig back
Get the money man, the root of all evil
They say ""Take it home man,"" but damn I gotta watch my people
You'll be high, cause one us lay there, not just him
But damn, everybody he ran with
They all gettin money man, money man

You'll never find a thuggish bunch of ruggish like us
Don't be so quick to test us
I'll be annoyed, and might bust
I'mma have to talk to Eazy through the Ouija
So I can see if maybe he can tell me why you hatin' on me
Bitin' on me, why you want me
To have to show you Leatherface
And he'll cut you down quicker
He's a real buck-'em-down, getcha
We be just rappin' but I'm down to scuff 'em, I don't hit cha
Playas put your checks from your ladies, get high
Then the ladies sneak your keys from the playas and ride
Everybody wanna party, even the haters with a problem
Hey, we done solve 'em, and quick, we'll squash 'em
Don't know me, eff you, when you got beef
But you also got to clone styles and no motif
See me rappin' on your TV, actin'
And it's a fact that when you see us in person
Think we won't flex or show you no action
Down for mine, got to show a busta time to time
So I figure I'll slow down the rhyme
So they can understand I'm filled with so much anger and pain
And if I drop, then I'll explode like an army grenade in ya
We ain't calm, time to ring the alarm
Break the killers outta prison, splittin' all the guards (Whoo)
Power to the people, givin' people the power to put it down in your city
Mo be rollin' with me, feel me?
I can't stand no dirty crooked po-po
When will we get at 'em, revenge 'em, they takin' no mo'
Mo' Thug the only clique that I claim
Although we are beyond the bangin'
You can say I roll with a gang
And dissin' chin-checkers in the makin'
You hear me, continue with the rotation


I heard, I murdered
I heard, I murdered, I heard (heard)
Yeah nigga, we holler about all of the murders
Look what they did to Tyrone
Flippin the flow and let it burn
Without pistols, the police ain't strong
Finna bomb, bitch, you fuckin wit all the black gat peeps
And in the 1999 when ya meet up in the end
Be it be no peace for the police
The (Biz) here to rip the (streets)
And get 'em all (pissed)
Get 
We don't take (defeat)
Me steppin' (retreat)
You can lose yo arms, better use yo feet
Jus pick up my cannon, nigga, yeah yeah
Hear the pump, it erupt
We're corrupt as the four, down to buck
Come and get fucked up
And get up outta the county, nigga get rowdy
(duck into battle)
Disappear-pear, in a ally
Reappear-pear, off in Cali
Can you feel me, daddy?
Proudly handle stuff like a man
And went through shit in Cleveland
With the band
Now look at me platinum
Fuck the rap, and corner bitch made hation nation
Nowadays an occupation
So why you hate me? Still can't fade me away
Go on, be gone
The point of view was made with the song
And while they pop, I'm ready to bomb
(bomb, bomb, bomb)


How do you see me when you see me?
Drinkin' on Hennessy and Remy
Look in my eyes, they always dreamy
Movin' the body as you toss it up
I buck, the gauge erupt, disrupt your order
Infantry, y'all better expect annihilation
Come around this SCT
I'm a soldier, organize up
But they're lovin' just us
Army see, full of harmony, so baby in thugs keep trust
You know we bust, so back up off me
Givin' no mercy, keepin' it physical
Lettin' the instrumental go as I break through a spiritual
Diggin' a ditch, all you po-po
Who felt you could come and raid
Ain't no way be to safe
It's the army brigade
So, listen up, and hear what's spoken
As I start this locomotion, retaliation
Because we chosen, showin' the Lord devotion

Now when your messin' with me
Make sure you know what you're doin'
Got playas that know what they doin' rollin' with me
Infrared to your head, don't beg, you said
We fled, gotta get away, gotta make sure I'm free
So when you need me I can buck another day
It's a Bone thang, better ride, ride
Cause what you're messin' with, you can die-die
Don't be surprised, Bone want your presidents
Wanna run it all, run all, all
Buck that dog, dog, I'm crazy, superstitious
Don't pull no gun if you ain't gon' spit
Click-clack-clack be the sound

See a nigga with money and they think they might try me (I doubt it)
Keep it movin baby, I'm the one that keep it player
No matter how you fix your hair or how you shake your derriere
I won't fuck it, trained not to love it
She won't cut into my budget with kids playin the puppets
It's a goddamn shame, America the great
Give a nigga a case because my pockets ain't straight
Look nigga, if you can't take care of your kids
Cause these set-up grimy bitches tryin to use them to live, nigga

Them Bone boys raw, and we got chips
If y'all act up then we load them clips
Whether rappin or it's guns nigga we do hits

Now I'ma show 'em how them Bone Thug niggas so unique with the flow
When it's time to rock it they gon' know that we got uncut dope
When they get to poppin niggas try to battle
I let my magnum tag along
Cause if a bitch don't watch his tounge he gon' get rattled
And be ashes on the family mantle, nigga can really really dust it
Silly the nigga to even fuck with me
I'm O.G. nigga, Cleveland's finest
But niggas started to trip cause it was hard to find us
Told them niggas better lay low, we got the Feds behind us
And we been movin, dippin, tryin to dodge they wires
Decided to stay quiet, let some time expire
Then come back like a riot and reflame the fire
Hangin out the passenger side of my Regal
Aimin at ya mind with a nine when I reload
When the Glock is empty then I grab my desert eagle
And BOP, BOP, BOP!

Hey! Hangin out the passenger side of Kray' Regal

That's water under the bridge, little Lay' so death defiant

Got to get up, and get it willin and able

And we gon ride, and we gon ride...
Bone Thugs, Mo Thugs, Thugline!
And we gon ride, and we gon ride, and...
We gon ride!

We gon ride, 'til the motherfuckin wheels fall off
It's that Bone Thug nigga with them still-ass balls
We let 'em hang and the sparks fly
I'm talkin about scrapin the streets and nigga movin so fast we turnin the dark light!
Ya niggas really don't want no friction from the automatics
You niggas ain't got enough money, sonny, I ain't even braggin
I'm in the toll taggin, collectin plenty paper
And if a nigga was strugglin, I'll probably pull a 'caper
These niggas is haters and they smilin in my face
Tappin like they need a gig, tryna get your boy erased
I hear the whispers say I talk a mean game
But I walk it like I talk it, plus I got a mean aim
Seem strange, cause them thugs keep on creepin up out of the cut
Like every other summer, just to fuck a nigga up
We got them +Thugs+ on the +Line+, got them +Thugs+ screamin +Mo!+
It's 2006, Krayzie let these niggas know, c'mon!

Now wait a minute, who said that we out of business?
Tell that nigga to quit the goddamn games, before we lit em
Hit 'em up, what! It ain't no duckin once we get to buckin
We shoot from the floor to the roof, or the thugs does it!
That Cleveland criminal hardcore shit, the girls love it!
And it really don't matter if you cuss or bust, fuck it!
Every nigga can feel it cause they recognizin the realest
But nigga, try me, you really be jeopardizin your livin here!
But don't make me to get my dier and have to boo-ya!
Some of the niggas gon have to get down, cause we'll do y'all
If you don't want the beef, nigga don't talk that shit!
Dog, the nine milli-heater gon bite after the ball, naw!
Katrina and Rita, ain't got nothin at all
On the bandages and damages that we gon put on y'all, for sure!
Run on up if ya want, cause we ready!
Indeed I keep the sweeper best believe we heated heavy, like that!

No way, no how, can't none of y'all see them Cleveland Thug Boys!
No way, no how, ain't none of y'all fuckin with them Bone Boys!
No way, no how, can't none of y'all see them Cleveland Thug Boys!
No way, no how, ain't none of y'all fuckin with them Bone Boys!

I was forced to make butter from the gutter, cream off the scene
Find the 8th wonder of the world in the streets
Band on bricks 'till my fist was bloody
Turn, hella corners in the '74 'Cutty
Buddy, you don't wanna come against this
Black fist, born to make history
Born from the misery
Grindin for a meal, searchin for a deal
Pranced in old, torn clothes
Keep it real bitch, I ain't start off rich
And I'm still mud-foot in, nigga shit ain't changed
One word too many, get your mouth rearranged
One nigga too many, shells go click-click
Clack-clack, clang-clang, bang-bang-BANG!
Your shit's been split down to the white meat
Fuckin with these Cleveland Gs, yeah, it's likely
You ain't gotta like me, just don't try me
Get crossed up, death becomes untimely
While time keeps winding, niggas keep grinding
Chasin paper, so outrageous, they just stand by, staring in amazement
You don't wanna be the one found under the basement
Gotta run your DNA just to find what your name is
Here's another victim of them Cleveland niggas!
Mo Thug, Bone Thug, get live niggas!

No way, no how, can't none of y'all see them Cleveland Thug Boys!
No way, no how, ain't none of y'all fuckin with them Bone Boys!

Been ready to bring the war, if you ain't, you ain't
We thuggish ruggish {*niggas*} always, always
Been ready to bring the war, if you ain't
Chorus: Krayzie Bone
Look into my eyes and tell me
What it is you see in me (Would you look into my eyes)
Look into my eyes and tell me
What it is you see in me (Could you tell me what you see)

Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring
Big {*niggas, fuck*} y'all
With a gang of bodyguards
My {*niggas*} is stone cold killers, peelers
Steppin' out the limos, the {*bitch*} soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin', my
Gang, you know me
Homeys get more love
And I'm blessed when I'm out of my senses
Pump my fist to Mo Thug
Gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders, Jesus
Sent me His roller
Loco, sober, load a revolver, hold 'em down, buck 'em all to hell, cause I'm sho'nuff
And I seen, that the bullet holes was too much, your luck, ya get blowed up
All of your {*niggas*} goes out the surgeons, said that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, cause y'all think that you can really hate
Repeat Chorus

It's a regular day when the haters hate me
But they could never fade me
Them stuffed in the trunk of my Mercedes, Krayzie ready
And you can believe that
You would believe me
When we get even
We get even
Fin to set it off in Cleveland
Welcome to the party
But no clone Bone imitators allowed
Cause we ain't tryin' to front nobody
But you rap like my partner, pal
Everybody say the same thing
Yeah, back in the days, a copper might have been toasted
But, man, really them copper wasn't sayin' nothin', cause evidently wasn't nobody listenin'
If you can look into my eyes, tell me directly what you see
Nine times out of ten, you're probably seein' revenge, and there's plenty within
Buck 'em all if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest, rest
What an ugly, ugly mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
Repeat Chorus

All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster
Givin' you the most, I toast to them thugs
And it ain't nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And these haters wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug-ness
More murder to the fools that clone
Five trues loc'ed out with the roughness
And it's war when you crap these Bones, we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all fakers, y'all know who you are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shut {*shit*} down in the industry, {*nigga*}, can you bite that
I know
Everybody wanna roll with pros, and make friend of foes, but we chosen
God done blessed us with His potion, pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
You don't wanna see the Bone never
Stay together, my click too clever
Ride through the days of the stormy weather
Remember, eternal, it means forever lastin'
Number one assassin, blastin', bashin' on all you haters wrong-doin's
All of the heavens gonna be ruined, trues
When He come, we won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong
Repeat Chorus

I see
Five thuggish ruggish {*niggas*} ready, roll wherever I go
True to put it, but don't wanna be a killer
But I gotta get down for mine, that's fa' sho
Hear you out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got
Is all mine, and when I see you, {*bitch*}, jump on your pockets double time
And it's like that
You don't want that
Come and get some pap-pap
Wanna sound like
Wanna be like, uh
Now you know we can't have that
Why you clones wanna bite the Bone rap, platinum raps
Bet that bitin' stuff
And they ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin' out of nothin'
Mug it, let's peel caps
Lyrically, buck 'em down
Bone, put 'em in its place

Bizzy Bone
A little something for the ladies, gettin' that money by any means/ Who get with the playa-type, thuggish ruggish, from the hood with good genes/ Who kick it in high heels, plenty tank tops, camoflague fatigues or thongs clear to the vision so you can see some good things/ Stretch marks? Body smoother than marble floors in the Hamptons/ Living large in a condominium or mini mansion/ Side kick, mobile phone, free, flip like Kurt/ I'm sort of religious, superstitious, but I ain't scared to flirt/ I'm from the dirt, root and soot/ Came up on my own foot/ Used to hang with the crooks, I keep a job on my books/ I took my chance with many girls, and still I look for the woman/ I like it crazy, sexy and cool; Waterfalls, good lookin'/ I can remember back in school, being judged by Chips/ And so I hooked up with the Bone Thugs, suddenly I'm the shit/ And baby momma's drama, common dilemas and problems/ And now, I'm single, ready to mingle/ Holla, holla, holla, holla
Krayzie Bone
Now I'm tryin' to get crackin', tryin' to get into some action/ So come and take a ride with Krayzie Jackson/ Don't worry about the weed or drank, I got some/ This potent dope, let's smoke and choke/ I can put you on a lovely level where you never been/ Especially is you're stressed and depressed, yes, I got the medicine/ Sippin' a little bit of Patron, let me help you in the zone/ Put some Thug music on, something like this, something like a Bone song, and oh, don't ease your mind, unwind/ Let's slide just a little bit closer/ Just feel my vibe, and chill, get high/ Hey now (Hey now) What'chu receive-a (What'chu receve-a) Ecstacy if you try this a reefa/ We rollin' blowin'/ Potent potions got you open, it's got you focused/ Let's smoke some more then
-Chorus-Will.i.am-
Come on, come on, come on, come on/ Baby, I got the cush and a bottle patron so let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin' baby/ Let's get it crackin' let's get it, get it crackin'
Wish Bone
When I'm gone on the Patron, have me humpin' all night long, long/ Heavy breathin' she all good, but I can't seem to reason/ So I guess I'm too high/ Turn it over, let her ride (Let her ride) Let her get hers two more times, I guess that's what I'd rather do/ But that liquor brings that attitude, and I might have to down a nigga/ Let off a round or two; Watch how they scatter, nigga (Nigga) Thugsta's pull triggers, fool/ Ain't nothin' new, you know how we do it, do'/ It's an everyday thang, thang/ Follow nothin' but thugsta's rules/ We can drank, we can drank/ We can smoke, we can smoke/ Hit the weedman, hit the store 'fore it close/ And we gotta keep it goin' till early in the morning/ I'm a POD, so we gotta keep it goin' cause I can get higher, higher/ If you can get higher, higher, then we can stay right, right/ You know ain't no party liver
Will.i.am
We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here/ We got drinks to serve, twistin' up the herb so fuck what's over there, there's a party over here, over here, over here...

Have a nigga on the ground screamin', ""Respect!""

Tell me whats happening, Imma be that thug that's out here keeping it cracking
Throwing up thug love on the real my city with me
And Cleveland is the city where we come from still
I got on my feet ?
In the dark lost and lonely you tripping
Better get it straight before it's too late
It's a new day, So damn slipping


Nigga I've been through hell and back
But I got these demons still after me they want me to sell my soul
But I won't fold oh noooo
I can't be broke I still a souljah boy
And my state of awareness some call it paranoid, whatever
Popo tapping my phone, bitches after my dough
Niggas plotting to kill me for a ho I didn't know
It's so scandalous ?
Temptation got my back against the wall, My God so I'm swinging
Steady dropping bombs on these demons that keep screaming
And my dreams they causing me harm and me I'm seeing
Walking in the rain, buzzing off the pain
Trying to get away, but no I really can't get out this game
I got my problems but I chose this life I gotta be a thug and maintain


? Tripping got me laughing at ya'll
So what you gonna do is really on you
You know it ain't really that hard
Got me screaming hay DJ will you play that song
Asking the dipping ya'll tripping when ?
And ya'll know
We do this for a living even if we don't get paid
We still be out here tripping cuz thats the thug way
And if u got a probelem i suggest you walk on
Money money money is all I really own
Scandalous, rough and rugged, is how I like it
Nine millimeter talking and you don't wanna try it
See that's is how a thug gets down (you heard, you heard)
Act like you know when you come around",https://genius.com/Bone-thugs-n-harmony-take-charge-lyrics

Lock it, if not then we gon' do it with the quickness, and the holy 'ah
Swifter with the thought, is they slippery, liberty or not?
I'm stuck up in the prison, religion, and do you see the cause?
Hatin in the temple, we got it, is you ready or not?
As-Salaam Alaikum, can't break 'em unless the hatin stops
Clockin in the nation, wanted my presence in the séance
God, I'm a play on, mosiac, don't even say it
Okay, no way, 55, no ways
That's the way we play, all day, all day
Christ, slice the diamonds in the knife
Yes, B.B. I'm the best, most definitely
Hefty, the water is so maximum, then holla back at 'em
""You got 'em Daddy? "" We gon' mash on 'em (mash on 'em)
Ghetto harmony, the army in the faction of the masses
Mob Life, Soprano, my nigga with no apples

And everything is tight, stars in the sky and a little of the moonlight

Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner
Baby chill, you know that you gon' be all right
And everything is tight, stars in the sky and a little of the moonlight

Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner

Okay I'll do it for the money, the chains and the bracelets
Caddy coupes and the Maybach too, daily I be chasin it
Nigga I'm impatient with it, all the time I'm tryin to get it
All about perfect timin, dig it? I'm a giant, you a midget
I could talk or show my digits, put that on my love
You talk about it, we live it, put that on my thug
We thugged out niggas, from the St. Clair area
Still got bank that's buried up, these motherfuckers is scared to touch
Rush up on a nigga with the wig split still
Even though these niggas sue I gotta keep it real
For the house up on the hill, I murda murda kill
That there is where I live, up there we do it big
Protected by Jesus, stand back, back
Artillery shops so stacked up; I be waitin for a nigga to act up
My ride down's a smooth one, these guns man I use them
Most times I got two guns, I'm a burst and I'm a fool son

Baby chill, you know that you gon' be all right
And everything is tight, stars in the sky and a little of the moonlight
Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner
Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner

And everything is tight, stars in the sky and a little of the moonlight
Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner
Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner

Now what are you thinkin about, leavin me stranded, I didn't plan it
Fresh Ralph Laurens, umbrellas to limos, still standin
Check the watch baby, wait, I must do business alone
Give me problems when I come home, now you in the zone
I'm makin love, let you know it's the choices of a dove
Who hardcore? Genesis baby, this is the cov'
Second God and give me immaterial love fo' sho'
No Eve, not an angel in sight, baby you know
When it's over then it's over, you can put it on, oh
There they go, watchin mental where your spirit and soul
Never been married and my brother's been murdered, but momma boast{? }
Close the case, then we gone, spend eternity with the Lord
No sentence, no repentance, just clean clothes in the ward
Huh, we in the yard, Allahu Akbar give me the swords
Slap skins with the homie, watchin my mother and child
Worship no cow, Thug love, baby you know my style

Baby chill, you know that you gon' be all right
And everything is tight, stars in the sky and a little of the moonlight
Ride to the rhythm of a prisoner

Paradise,Behind the Harmony,UnKnown,"Well, it's not far down to paradise
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right we can sail away
And find tranquility
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on
And we can keep sailing on, sailing on, sailing on

Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind and I'm tryna get away
Creep off by myself and go hide, fly so high everyday
Tryna sail to the other side
And clear my mind and get P.O.D.'d every time
~*sailing*~
Life as a rapper, got me creeping faster from chasing after paper, I got to catch'm- make it last
And this world we living in all I need is my ith and a little bit'a hand to persuade myself
Insane, the brain mayne that's been joining the game, and that's the ticket all the way to the bank
I'm goin crazy, crazy, crazy...
But I don't want to be this way,(way, way, way, way)

Sometimes I find that I talk to myself here
Drinking and smoking too much- shit ain't healthy
Been tryna fight it but I, I can't help it
Tryna get wealthy cuz it's really keeping me stressing
Can't trust nobody, kinda make it hard for me to love somebody
*Somebody's been sailing, and blowing away in the wind*
I think sometimes so I can level my head-
Gimme some time so I can level my head
I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy...
But I don't want to be this way, (way, way, way, way)

We'll make it a double (we'll make it a double)
We'll stay out of trouble, yeah (we'll stay outta trouble, yeah)

Now gimme some Henny, any brown liquor, Coca-Cola in ice
Hittin the club, next to the bar, feelin so nice in my eyes
A little somethin lookin thirsty, order some Dom towards her table
Bring her some O-J full of Mimosa, strawberries, and a coaster
Lookin cool, like Clark Gable fittin my gangsta fedora
Light up a Newport, in a non-smokin section, stars important though
Do what I do smoothly, she keep lookin like ""Come""
Finish my Henny, no more Henny, fuck it, give me some rum
Order my slow jam, my homies is whisperin like ""This Bizzy""
Her expressions is like, ""That's who he is? "" Yeah that's who is he
She motions to me chill with her, take my rum and go over
She's tellin her girls to move over, I'm surrounded by my soldiers
And one of 'em drinkin Ketel One, and one of 'em drinkin Tanqueray
One of 'em drinkin Goose, and the other, Perrier-Jouët
My limo is in the back, we have all that plus weed
Watchin movies with five broads, drinkin Mo' in the streets

I've been drinkin and you're on my mind
(toss it up, comin close with me)
Let me hit it one more time (toss it up, comin close with me)
We'll make it a double (we'll make it a double)

Not Dat Nigga,Home CD Single (England Import),UnKnown,"Ya I got a couple a cribs or what nigga
Rollin' and sittin' on dub dubs nigga
But I don't have to wear no diamonds to shine
Don't need none of dat cause I'm Bone, Bone

Look at me tipsy sippin' on some bay goose
Finna let loose cause I can
Fuckin' wit people off the grind nigga you know me I'm the man
Cleveland is the city where the thugs that get down
Just come to my town and ask around they tell you who the rawest in town
Cause I'm a thug by nature
Strictly fo' the paper
Ain't nobody steppin' to Steve
I come wit the ones I come wit the guns
I come wit the rangs that go bang
It's still an everyday thang
To let my nuts hang
You wanna performance wit dat ticket
If the price we can kick it
Like lick imma hit
Party on I gots to get it
Keep the foxy women backin' it up (backin' it up)
While them hatas keep on actin' up
You flashin' what? I'm flashin' flossy nuts
Girl if you comin' take a ride wit me
And if you ridin' wit me sit back recline in yo seat
Cause in the world where I'm from the sun always shine
And even a nigga don't want it baby the world is mine
So come on


I'm out of my mind with a ski mask chains and gloves
Waitin' for niggas to come out of the clubs (I hit'em up)
Give me the dubs for my niggas that bang and slang drugs
You fuckin' them niggas up
Ain't no love for Bone Thugs
Nigga fuck y'all you bitches used us
It's splitin' as usual
I ain't takin' no shit from none of y'all
Don't wanna see none of my niggas with no money huh
Since a nigga young you think you dealin' with dummies
Oh you a son of a that's why I split yo bitch
Flipin' that activist for freedom
And my Bone Thug to make a medum no podium
Just fist full nails to leave qiukly youngest Bone nigga 7 sign (7 Sign)
Past that crime y'all get with me


We steppin' inside the party marty gratis
Now get me a shot of Bacardi let it get up in my body
Make my body body rock
I'm lookin' at rappers so full of shit
Imma just get up against the wall dog and pull on my dick
Tell the DJ don't even tell them we in here we on the low
No thuggin' in the V.I.P for me and my niggas we on the floor
We finna get this party started right could you put some thug music on
They think I'm buzzin' cause I'm shake my ass
But I got nephews and cousins watchin' you flashin' yo cash (oh yeah)

What the hell is goin onnnnn?
(These are our blocks, these are our hoods, these are our streets)

It's a war zone in the poor zone, we chasin after the fortune
In the belly of the beast is scorchin, little kids is forced to tote guns
We so numb it's like fo-fum, bloody redrum for the income
Refusin to be a victim, we do it and take it and then some
Tryna get out, and give back, the government givin us no slack
They double up on our taxes, send us to jail because we sell crack
But them airplanes been flyin, since Reagan was the president
Was evident, seem irrelevant, what's the relevance to your precedence
Let us live, quit willie lynchin, Layzie Bone got the heart to mention
The reason we live in attention, cause the po-po a gang of henchmen
Who resistin, quit trippin, I'm just tryin to earn a livin
Tryin to go up against the system, keepin my ass up out of prison
Listen, you younger niggas, you got to have vision
If you see it you can read it, Jesus died for the vision
But the vision is to walk with swag, hold your head and walk in brag
Never let 'em make you mad, rep yo' set and get the cash


Emergin from the cig' butt, showin up, comin up
Barbecues by the pool, the neighbors can't believe it's you
Livin how you will, house up on the hill
Rides with big wheels, it's they worst nightmare
Gimme mines right here, dark skin, curly hair
Soul man, African-American
I don't mind your kid starin at my dude, dancin to my tunes
It don't matter cause we set the trend for everything they do
Put the road to the wheel, put the fire in your meal
Took the dog from your wife, put the log in her life
Now it's all about you get it cause yo' shit real light
We the ones that keep it poppin and got the whole world vibin
You wanna get in our minds, cause we got the perfect timin
To build a whole new world, take my gold and my diamonds
But it's okay cause I'm rhymin, chasin this money and grindin
Up the ladder I'm climbin - and you can clock me as I roll by!

Whaaaaaat's goooooo-ing onnnnn

Debt to Society,UnKnown,2013.0,"Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?

First off, I'ma set the record straight so won't you lend me your eardrum
Nobody need to wonder where the hunger come from
It's full of thunder when it rumble, Stack don't fear none
Got 'em back on the track after so many years
When I was judged by twelve of my peers
That's bullshit they have your life in the hand of strangers
Now you can add up all the tattoo tears
Still doin' what I feel I gotta do, dawg, that's number one priority
I never been the ordinary
I put the extras on it, they call a nigga minority
They said I was a lost cause
Been in and out the system, doors revolved
I should of been thinkin', I shouldn't been drinkin' so much
'Cause problems alcohol never could solve
Drop my drawers, on top of the roof clownin'
Had to talk down on 'em, give a nigga hassle, harassin'
I'm livin' in my castle
The blast sound off, keep smashin', poundin' on 'em
In the mornin' arrested with a hell of a story to tell
Took half of a million, post bail
Fuck it, had to put it all up for sale
While society got us caught up in structural violence
So, when the table is turned, we fed up so we uprise
Set it off like an L.A. wildfire, burn, baby
Burn as the globe turns 'til it's over, ain't no slackin'
Smack me, I'ma smack you back
And it gets worse if we start pullin' out debt

Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?

Everybody wanna know how the greatest is underrated
There's never been another more imitated than Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh, truly amazin'
Here to stay and ain't nobody that can move me or sway me
Like a deadly disease, I'm really hella contagion
You better stay away or you'll catch the innovation
Less the limitation, stretched the litigation
Keepin' my situations heated with complication
I'm tryna tell 'em how to know I paid my dues
A lot of other rappers couldn't walk a day in my shoes
Stayed in my shoes to call them my street blues
I pity the fool that try to stop these trues
Now they see me comin', runnin' at 'em, doin' a hundred
I want it, I need every dollar bill, y'all
All the debt paid up
Even write the check to myself, pay us
Yes, I'm takin' it all

Got a call just the other day
Heard what the media had to say
They don't know about me
Nothing's gonna stop me from climbin'
And I know, they twist the things I do and say
And try to get my soul to break
I'll keep risin' to the top
Give it all I've got, I'm a fighter

Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?

And let me break it down 'bout livin' Bizzy
Ain't nobody gonna play me, wake up swingin'
But my enemies can't get to me
Remember me, much slicker than a centipede
A deader me's a better me
You motherfuckers 'member when I talk about the murder, murder, murder
Don't be beggin' to me
'Cause ain't nobody gonna come to my street, I keep heat
Tell 'em nigga, bailin', nigga, all will be well
And I don't open the lock, no, nigga, not for the cops
I'm right here, nigga, sittin' on the porch
With my niggas gettin' scorched
While my niggas gettin' torched
We can toss in the stone, really give 'em a book
'Member the dream, triple beam
When I go back to court in the 
Nigga, this me with dinosaurs
By the way, let's tell 'em the truth
That nigga fuckin' with who?
That nigga fuckin' with you
Then let me tell you who you fuckin' with too
Now let me show how we do
See stack can't lose and the devil's bad news
Man, fuck these shoes and the county blues
Everybody wanna do it like Zeus
I came to get loose
I came to get raw
I came to get seen
With death or no truce
That's gon' be the truth
That's gon' be the rule
I'm in my body ready to die
Forever with you, I'm bailin' with you
You ready to kill, I'm ready to ride
I'll deal with my pride if my dreams come true
Platinum still, and that's for Will and that's for real
And that's the last kill
Last time niggas ever see me chillin' in the body
Give me my shotty, I gotta get both of his dues
Now let me slide to the other side with all of my troops
I keep rex with the boots, and my nigga recoups
Who will I write to? I done mentioned the pilin' 
That I got to pay my debt to society

Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
You still wanna punish me when I paid my debt back to society?
Why they lie on me?
Don't you be blinded
Don't believe everything that they're writin', it's only one-sided
