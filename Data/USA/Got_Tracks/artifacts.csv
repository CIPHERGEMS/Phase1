Wrong Side of Da Tracks,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1994,"I'm out to bomb like Vietnam under the same name Tame One
The bad one, ink flow master bastard with the Magnum
I tags up quick and then I steps to the exit
When it's time to get sefted or flex on some fresh shit
Some wack crook stole my black book I know who took it
I know his whole tag because the fag writes his name crooked
The ink I use might stink but you gotta think
I got my props Hoppes 'cause my tags don't shrink
I'm tagging and bagging bitches cause my name is famous in the street
'Cause they know my name's from cruising in the Jeeps
So yo grab a can and put your man up and stand up
For the fresh never stale niggas off the third rail
Deep dark and black like the Magnum I pack
It's that Artifacts chat from the wrong side of da tracks

The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side

I load my backpack with spray paints and markers to spark the
Tag I never drip, I catch the path, take a trip
To the train yards and think back, when I used to write that
Shit that used to hit
, had all the mad color tips
Breaking was my thing I used to spin the back
I never thought I'd spin the wax with tracks to make your hands clap
I could've went the other way but no haps
I got my dap on the map with the Bic down to a spray cap
Niggas used to doubt to my clout but now I turn em out
They shout my shout out uptown like they wanna be down
Avoid the crowds that wanna stab me in the back enough of that
Watch the third rail track 'cause I don't wanna get zapped
Pieces I burn to show my name no shame
Don't wanna put the blame down on my nigga Tame
Brothers don't wanna see me grow to get my cash flow
I have no remorse, so check me out in The Source

The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side
[Verse Three: Tame One & 
El Da Sensai
]
I burn my name up quick like a Thai stick
As red as my eyes get I still rocks the fly shit
Back with some ultra flat black
 
catchin wreck in a sec
Wet paint, ain't shit, when I'm on the set
I'm live like the third rail,
 
on time like a PATH train
The name Tame alone got fame so fuck a last name
I tags mad when I drag a fat sack of ism
Comin out with New Editions like Mike Bivins
I get a sticker from my nigga with the bag of em
Write my name on em then I peel off the back of em
And stick em to victims of underground systems
Let the toys bring the noise, me and my boys are gonna diss em
In conclusion don't snooze when two niggas from the Jerz
Kick the mad graffiti slurs and kick the bass to the curb
The Artifacts Jack, bringin the art of facts back
Some seem to forget about the ebony that caught wreck
So remember this you're tender when you slip in to enter
The Artifacts zone cause graffiti's still prone
To kick ass pizazz slash let me tag
Why is that black? Because the wack jack was known as a fag
So don't cross the path that's the gat to your back
The Artifacts out, wrong side of da tracks

The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side",https://genius.com/Artifacts-wrong-side-of-da-tracks-lyrics
C’Mon Wit Da Git Down,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

C'mon and get down with that Artifacts sound
Where kids get wreck and, the beat's bound to pound
We're strolling through the industry, B
See we gotta be, the next shit that kicks, 'cause brothers ain't got it
In this rap shit, 
ain't no time for the dilly-dally
Pally throw a match in the Gasoline Alley
Blew up mad spots, kids was jealous for the props
See the shit never stops, hops, just looking for my dillz-knot
Styles relate, never fake, 
broke breaks in every crate
Old freestyles and dirty ass copied-over tapes
Notify that; the Artifacts never slack
While crews is on stage wack, we just play the back
Now, the flip tripper ripper slits ya wit da mixture
All crews, who never paid dues, watch it 'fore I get ya
'Cause nowadays, it's da ways, of da underground
But they're wack now, so c'mon wit da git down

C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

You know the stacks, if not, then ask some niggas who heard of me
The half on the Artifacts in Jersey
'Cause brothers be buggin', not givin' love to the nuccas
Sayin' fuck us, 'cause we be shinin' brighter than the suckers
Shootin' me prison nobody listens to your dissin'
'Cause, yo, my shit's legit and as a lyricist I'm hittin'
The high notes, so why don't, I smile when I take pictures?
'Cause now that I rock I got more niggas on my jock than bitches
I just wanna do my jams with fams and slam into some hypeness
But biters and backstabbin' rappers don't even like us
But props due, peep The Source, Rap Pages and the Billboard
And read about the tours while you be flappin' your jaws
I freak techniques, 'cause talk is cheaper than beepers from Broad Street
Punks pop junk, Tame and Da Sensei leave 'em all beat
So peep how deep my technique freaks and how my shit sounds
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Hold up, you rap sucker duck, buck, the track's rough enough
To prove a point, that the niggas is the joint
Magazines where we're seen, now pop the tape in your deck
I got the Heavy Ammunition
 
cuz I'm Flexi Wit Da Tech
Niggas, can't believe the Artifacts achieve
Got, tricks up my sleeve so bow down on your knees
Yo, we ain't got the same lame, ordinary plain game
Put to shame any crew who wants to feel the flame
So bring submission to the rap recognition
My right hand is itching from the shit that I'm scripting
So pass the baton, to the next runner up
, Tame
I give a pound so, c'mon wit da git down

Aiyyo, word to my grandma's tampons, I drop bombs, but since
Our demo tracks had gaps some said my fat raps was half-assed
Watchin' others rock and clock we shocked 'em like a robot
With our props, so now the Notty Head Niggas got more knots yo
My pockets are lumpy, chump, my drunk style is trunky
Dunk 
my disc in crisp, put funk in funk like Humpty Hump
Cuz I'm comin' from the underground I'm down wit da git down
MC's who used to diss us, get pissed 'cause they ain't shit now
The Artifacts, represent on every stage we step on
The days of gettin' slept on, are dead because we keep on
Peepin' these weak MC's, 
who cheese with their bologny
'Cause they're phony as fuck, and couldn't pull shit off of tow trucks
So yo bro, now you know my flow so go and sit down
Or c'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down
C'mon wit da c'mon, git down wit da git down

Lower Da Boom,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"[
Cheech and Chong
]
A lot of cats put down grass man
Like uh, uhh.. because they say things about it
Like it makes you, lose your memory and all that
Well I just wanna say that uhh, uhh
I forget where I was man
(""Ohh-h OK cut, Freddy, Freddy stop.."")

Boom Skwad in the house
I lower da boom when I do the cypher dance
With naps and saggy pants as I romance the plants
I take puffs on 
stuff, rough enough to give a buzz
To my cuz, even though he don't touch the stuff
See this blunt in my front, some say might stink
But yo the skunk helps me think
I'm a boom smoker joker with the knack because I'm gifted
Some say misfit, but fuck it let's get lifted
I get a box of 50
, get nifty with a spliff G
And tick tackle 
new jacks who tried to diss me
I've walked through the rain for dimes at the sess spot
Not hot with cops, cause I'd hate to get popped
I'm a terror to a trey bag,
 son you'll soon see
But I gots to get, higher, lower the boom G

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent; don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

*inhaling* Ahh, I just catch the fumes
I consume, bend the room, with the 
Nubian
 tune
Spark another L for the cypher
Sit back and light the, five inch adventure that's alrighta
Lower the boom, for the sess bags thicker
One's a flight to Phillie, while the other one's the liquor
Off to the weed spot, the bags better be fat
Or else you catch the 
speed knot
, and holmes you don't need that
Spark the indo or the L, sniff the weed
But I never get splits mista cause Tame's been hip ta
The baby of the blunts, so I'm down to catch the contact
Here's the rap chat, it's a fact that I react
Smooth from the boom consumed a zoom zoom a zoomin
MC El the leaner cleaner thoughts dials tune-in
Into, the matter roll the blunt bunt batter
Pass the shit quick, don't flip, with the chit chatter
I never puffed cause once 
my lungs got jammed
My man said it wouldn't kill, but I choke, god damn
The sess starts to cloud the room
The Artifacts, commences ta, lower the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent; don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Ohh 
I hope I live to see the day they make it legal
So all the people can see what I'm smokin ain't evil
Stop callin me a pusher cause I take pulls and take tokes
Cut snakes, cut breaks
, and I hate fake folks
So pass the cheeba senorita cause I need a
Fat fuckin Phillie just before I funk a freaker
Creatin from a milk crate with hooks and riffs
I can lift em, and shift em makin jams like this
With the blunt in my left hand and the Phillie in my pocket
MC El, at my right, with the mic so I can rock it
Sess makes my eyes red, but shades only cost three bills
In 
Hooterville
, so I'm chill
See the bigger the blunt, is how I feel about my indo
Because my moms would never throw my shit out the window
I puff herb til noon, chill and watch cartoons
Yes once again, I lowered the boom

Are you weeded?

Nope see, I'm doper for the session
Catchin wreck, check the 
tec
, cause I'm sober for the sketch
If I'm caught smokin blunts, I catch a bad one from my clan see
I'm higher than a messiah so you know I'm handy dandy
Legalize it holmes cause the zone's gettin bigger
From the whites, to the Ricans, cause
They learned it from the niggas
So who's the first to kick it real, for the, cypher
Eight Phillies so you know you gots to pass the other lighter
Pass the incense gents, it smells out in the hall
My growth was never stunted cause I'm six feet tall
No need for the sheepa cheeba cleaner than, Beaver Cleaver
Though I'm down to pitch, with my skit like Tom Seaver
Either, or my jaw speak of true features
I must be, the freaker of the sober class teacher
So pass the Visine, so you can keep your eyes clean
Look to Looney Tunes, we lowered, the boom

Lower da boom, you got to lower da boom
Where the brothers puff the ism and the smoke clouds the room
Spark that blunt, represent; don't front
We got what you want, it's the indo funk

Lower da boom
Spark that blunt
Lower da boom, ya got to lower da boom
Spark that blunt, represent, don't front

I just wanna say that ahh
A lot of you cats, that don't think
Marijuana should be legalized
Well you're all fucked (""Cut!!"")",https://genius.com/Artifacts-lower-da-boom-lyrics
Whayback,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"""A world premiere""
""A world premiere""
""A world premiere""

I calculate that eighty-five was the year
I first grabbed the pen, daydreamin' of the cheers
Ahead from rockin' shows, no Girbauds that sag
The windbreaker suits and backspins that was mad
I stress progress, roll joints at my rest
'Til the ill wee hours, and I knew it was the best
I hit mad spots, many crews got dropped
While I was gettin' props niggas was dealin' on the block
Stayin' in crib on the weekends
'Cause was Marley Marl was freakin
The cuts Mr. Magic was speakin'
That's how I got my first taste, makin' tapes
'Til the rhyme skill was great and my style would escalate
Practice made my perfect tactics
Now my dap gets clap, 'cause I'm the rap snap fanatic
But now in nine-trey I got the T-Ray track
And my trunks, my roots are growin' styles from way back

""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""

I flash back to fat Kangol hats with plastic
Back when steppin' on kicks in eighty-six got your ass kicked
Bombers and sheepskins, were common when I first started rhymin'
Still I found time to go bombin'
Me and my pals rocked Cazals with no glass
Dark flavored Clarks, Lee Denims off the ass
Back when Mr. Magic had it goin' all the way on
The beef with BDP added flavor like a crayon
Indeed MCs would represent with the skills
But now in ninety-three a lot of them can get the dillz
It seems like a little somethin' missin' in the mix
But now I got a deal, so it's up to me to fix
When niggas put me up on, with funky raps to cut on
Word is bond, if I hear another wack rap song
I might snap and it's an actual fact
That I'mma kick it like that 'cause this is strictly 'bout the way back

""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like that tha- tha-that, it's like that y'all""
""It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like that tha- tha-that, it's like that y'all""

Aww man, damn, way back things was kinda fat
Had the Godfather knot, a Starter hat, things are kinda wack now
Packed up, my cardboard and stepped away
I didn't have a choice, the culture was slayed
Graffiti had died, and things were dissapearin'
The West coast was here and all these wack beats appearin'
DJs were breakin' down record store doors
To get the Biz Dance and the Chante Moore's
Peace to Buck Four, Rocksteady on the floor
New York and Dynamic crews plus many more
Remember the time when you didn't pack a nine
Niggas just came to hear some funky ass rhymes
But all of that's over 'cause brothers wanna act up
No clubs to go to, they'll just pack rap up
That's how the media wants it to stop
So peep the first and last showing of Graffiti Rock
So check it, the brothers wanna wreck it
To get what's expected, 'cause hip-hop should be respect
Gotta get it back to get it on track
Artifacts kickin' styles illy on the way back

Like back when my Timberlands were only size sixes
I used to take pictures shootin' spitballs at bitches
Cross New Jersey Transit just to see a rapper kick it
But now I ain't with it 'cause niggas just ain't worth the ticket
Shit man, I remember jams that were slammin'
Gettin' me and my man in was harder than backgammon
DJs would scratch back to back on boom baps
And rappers with real raps could drop shit real fat
But now kid, as I recollect, rappers out who caught wreck
Respected, just got stuck up in my tape deck
Real deal hip-hop, when Biz used to flip-flop
His fat ass, on stage'd do a dance in busted Reeboks
Niggas must've forgot when real rhymes was hot
'Cause now if you ain't gold you ain't got no props
But fuck that, I'm above that, I don't play that
The Artifacts staff drops math about the way back

""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Going way back, way back, way back""
""Back in- Back in the days""

""It's a demo...""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""You gots to chill...""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""South Bronx""
""To the- to the Bridge""
'South Bronx""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""Jimbrowski... that's what it is""
""Back in- Back in the days""
""It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like that tha- tha-that, it's like that y'all""
""It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
It's like that tha- tha-that, it's like that y'all""

Flexi With Da Tech(nique),Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"Verse One: Tame One, El the Sensai
*reggae growl* I diss batty bwoys like Buju
Banton
, rippin wan-tan destruction
Sag my pants to stop the suction plus it's quicker when I'm fuckin
Split Dutch Master faster; I puff izz that causes asthma, ask the
Sensei from NJ, quick to give up papes
Beef'll keep it street, defeat niggas who sleep
Or reap the concrete status, kick your ass with my apparatus
Those who, oppose this; split their shit like Moses
My written tabs is rippin fags and the whole bit
I murder mics and tape decks, so check it while I wrecks it
Far from junkies, keep it real because 
I'm hungry like the Bundy's (""Al!!"")
Got more rumble than thunder, crumple chumps like they was paper
Eight for ki's, make G's, but One of Tame made these
Conjunction junction what's your function on the real
My mass appeal is real, I swim through beats like Navy Seals
Irregular, my style, suckers competitors who think they better
I knit my skit, like my Grandma's sweater
Nuts who want to inflict, harm against the charmer
Best to rest their case because I wear medieval armor
To protect, my subjects, my style's quite hard
Never could you copy cause my style's quite odd
Select the best concepts, context to rhyme text
Plus a twenty dollar bet, niggas flexi wit da tech
Chorus: samples of Jeru the Damaja and BizMarkie
""The tech's technique, cause he's a technician""
""One two, whatcha gonna do""

Verse Two: El the Sensai, Tame One
I rip rhyme charts apart, I jump-start on the gunner
Arrest niggas like Honda from the under, never blunder wonder if
I get stiff, I'm bound to catch an L
Nah, never that I'm down with Tame, I'm MC El
Lately playin Hurricane G demos in my Walkman
I walk and I talk and read issues of The Source
 and
Check out the dreadlocks in Bedrock puffin indo
By the branch, like plants, and do the cypher dance
Then it's back to the set, to write raps about my eps
Takin tokes for the stress as I get flexi wit da tech
Ah, I whip the lyrics up, like batter chatters on the verge
I sink all ships and watch you crabs submerge
In depths of the boat doper ropes is to distort
All sorts of brothers abuse my styles I must abort
I do jobs like miles around the necks of the title
I win it hands down and pants down cause I'm vital
The tech, might you wanna get mad, now freak the plannin
Plus I flips it, skip the hand scans, I'm woozy when I'm splifted
Yeah still high, the ill fly, red-eye ripe dead eye semi
Automatic Artifact, with knaps causin heart attacks
To critics and honeydips, who jeered on my lyrics
And slept when I dropped that 
""Do You Wanna Hear It?""
Cause from sun-up to sundown, my eyes are red and rundown
I still smoke a pound if strong peeps hit the town
I'm flexible like every female Huxtable was fuckable
Impeccable, despicable, on point like a decimal
Point twice, the joint jumper, nicest with the mic device
Mighty like Isis, gimme boom I rips a crisis with the stress
(with the stress) unless I'm gettin flexi wit da tech

Shut up, you're talkin too loud, you're talkin too loud
Peace to the whole city of Newark",https://genius.com/Artifacts-flexi-with-da-technique-lyrics

Ism I get bizm, with rhythm no bullshit

I'm funky as hell, since I rock the twelve inch
And now fakes imitate the great like Elvis
Oh goodness gracious, oh golly gee wolly
I'm good googa booga good golly Miss Molly
I use a loaf of bread a pint of milk a stick of butter
To keep my weight up, to knock a sucker to the gutter
I empty my rhyme clip, and kick like a fat gat
El you got my back, so where's your black ass at?

I'll let loose to juice to freak the funk spunk no punk
I'm doin the funky chicken as I'm kickin like a Shaolin monk
MC El Da Sensei with another one to bash ya
Lyric master, blaster, kick my skit faster
Best in my section, I'm fresher check the lesson
Progress is progressin as I'm buildin on my section
Hyperactive raps are gettin super static
With the rap erratical acrobatical massive combatical
So, move over cause the style that's rippin
Is comin from the grand man that is not slippin
But I'm trippin, kick the comp romp stomp and pomp
Cause my style is flyer Renaldo Neidermeyer
Hip hip hoorah, check it how i do tha
Thing that I swing I won't front..
Yo, I got the lyrical ammunition to your chest

I make Oprah rhyme by throwin chairs at Geraldo
Rivera, I joke around like, Hanna Barbera

My hair got the knots, my name got the props
I'm the coach of the rap note cause I call the shots
Tamer Dee, Tamer Dee, I'm showin the mad me
Damn style flam and T why? We ain't family
Keep that real, I smoke buddha and pack steel
Check the rap deck, cause this is the last deal
Good God, baby pah, give it to me check it
BRARABRARABBAHHH bust it, BRARAHRABAHABA wreck it

Comin back, to capture, with the fat rapture
Intact to Tic-Tac, my style you can't catch-a
Why? Let's see, I'm not ordinary
Kind of impossible, unstoppable, brothers pop a lot of bull..
..skip to my loo, I'm never ever to do
Hot tamale oh golly I'm wicked with the folly
All types of sneakers fo' the freaker of the speaker
Bass for the bottoms and the highs for the tweeters
Sample from The Meters, check it how I speak the
Words pound for pound, fuck ten ounces and the liters
I won't sniff Blow, even if you said his name was Kurtis
My style can go through changes, from Latin down to Turkish
So keep slippin cause that ass I'll be kickin

Whose techniques are weaker than the graphics for the Gobots
I rock with raw steel like Sue Richards, when Rick smacks her

Attack of New Jeruzalum,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"Aiyyo, check this, check that, MC El, my shit fat
Rockin' off this bugged track, you say we're wack, yo fuck that
Word to life, I kick the hyper type of cipher rap'll gather
After, my skills master of the dip dapper
I hold the fort with my sorts, rap sports
I got niggas on my dick, from down South to up North
Rhymes rip the hipper nigga, take a swigger
MC El the rigger of the fat style you can't figure
Rhymes out the ass, you can't pass up
My rizzle dizzle dazzle, tears up the band like  hassle
I blows with my flows, bust your nose, kick the ass of pros
Who ain't got the how-knows to make the crowd go (HO!)
Out they see, complete my rap technique
Take up mad Chiefs, I go through 60 packs in a week
Attack of New Jeru as I do my doo-dah
Shit everyday, peace to niggas around my way
From Da Bricks, where every block it got mad crews
MC El Da Sensei with the attack of New Jeruz

Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum
Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum
""Check it, who wanna wreck it? I be on some next shit""
""Check it, who wanna wreck it? I be on some next shit""

Well as I step up, I'm fuckin' raps up, and snappin' quicker
I'm slicker than a zipper, get more wet than Flipper
Got trunks and crates full of P-Funk breaks
I'll take Bootsy make a loop and you get souped because I'm great
With the four bar sample, add a bass and kick
You're on my dick for my tricks, when I fix the remix
I twist this disc with emphasis, since
Dead presidents took residence from dollars and cents
I got pull like Magneto rollin' cee-lo with steel dice
My black book make, more people petrol than Heidi Fleiss
I'm nice on mic jacks, and murder to a dub deck
The Knotty Headed ruffneck, Tame don't give a fuck yet
I jump up the funk to smoke the blunt that's like a tree trunk
I get blitt to rip shit, still piss and call MCs punks
My knotty throwin body blows like 
The trooper's gettin' zooted off the funky herbal buddha
Don't test me, press or even stress to try to serve me
'Cause I'm down and dirty from the undergrounds of Jersey
Word to Fats daddy 'cause I'm fatter than your Timberlands
Ladies and gentlemen, Tame got more balls than Wimbledon
So step up and get your fronts cracked
By the blunt crackin' rapper, and get your bitch before I smack her

Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum
Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum
Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum

The J, the A, the Y, the B, the U, the R, the N
Watch your back, look over your shoulder
I'm 'bout to roll you over with a bulldozer
Get on the CB one rover
'Cause I pulverize a MC 'cause I'm nicer
Click click click, I hunt MCs like I'm the Predator
Don't think this shit is better 'cause I kill like I'm a matador
Lyrics bust through my lips just like I sing a song
Jay got more flavor, than Goya Adobo
I'm wreckin' CDs and tapes with ""That's Them"" logo
Keeps you jumpin' like a pogo, chicks are dancin', doin' a go-go
I got the killer instinct, make MCs extinct
Pep more than ginseng, always stand distinct
Forwards I rip, backwards I pir
Just know I keep the stage warmer than fur
No way to control it, my style is automatic
Many MCs' systems shut down when young gun comes around
Plus I rode more chicks in stirrups than Lou Diamond Phillips
Makin grills swell up while they watch me blow up
On stage I step up in a violent rage, the five-oh says damn
Jay B's should've kept your black ass in a cage
Locked up with the Artifacts, I kick the nonstop rap
MC El and Tame One got my back
In the attack of what? Attack of New Jeruzalem

Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum
Attack, of what? Attack of New Jeruzalum

I X-Men like Cyclops
When I lift my shades up, my eyes blaze Ghetto Red Hot
But as is, my ad-libs, are more wicked than bad kids
Ask Biz if Tame leaves marks like a shit skid

It's the Mister, on a mission mixer of the rougher
Mix the snuff that get you up ? but no style is tougher
I dismiss crews, I bruise, snooze ya losin
Groovin provin I can do in men who went out smoother
Artifact chart, my rap gat starts to battle
Tracks be fat so who dat?  Nigga I be through black

I get biz on bitches, 
puff izz with my cousins
Tame shit so wild, honies roll they eyes like 
Teddy Ruxpin
I hit mad skins, then roll up bills on the reals
My skills mad ill, but chill kid, everything's real
From naps up top, down to the wrinkles in my Reeboks
I'm up late like Leno playin demos from my toolbox
My crew rocks, two blocks away from the buddha spot
I'm out but don't get it fucked up, cause I want you to rock

I come from the slums of New Jeruz I do bums
Who can't adapt no haps son, you know I close on caption
You know this, boss niggas like 
Lex to Mr. Otis
You can't hold this BITCH I'm swift like a lotus
..

Well it's the wiseguy, who never did a driveby
But I fly zones, and shine like chrome, on 7:35
I, play my Hi-Fi, volume up sky high
Talkin buddha thai, don't bother tryin to fascinate my eye
I got 20/20 like Baba Wawa on a Friday
Buy my tape, so I can put a Cruiser in my driveway
Say hi Tame, pass the dutch so I can take a puff
Of Born Cypher Cypher Master, I never get enough
No curls, no braids, peasy heads still get paid
Smokin sassy-frassy, that grows free, in the Everglades
And get lit, trip up on the phone and talk some sex shit
But that's some next shit, yo peace I'm out to the exit

It's the funky Mister Ripper split your ass
Quick-fast, you never outlast the outcast
I'm stompin weak-ass niggas, so ready let's go
I gas up a skit, I got the snaps on the petrol
I'm never fake I break the funk breaks I'm breakin
MC El create the styles that brothers ain't makin
To go past the end I run you over like a semi
Remember I be the guy, who's fuckin up your shit I
Be the one to call myself def in any program
Scan my battleplan before I step into a jam
I cross the major diction when fixed I'm a rap magician
You keep fishin for rhythms while I'm puffin on the ism

Dynamite Soul,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"In comes the ones from Jeruzalum slums
Knockin bums out for clout, Jersey rules without a doubt
On the real, keep it kinda fat for the brothers
From the Wrongside of Da Tracks, and it goes like that
Since the beginnin of time, the Artifacts kick rhymes
Straight tape after demo tape in eighty-eight
It's so dynamite, shit's outta sight
Snatch up a G and demonstrate for the night
Sip on the brew, me and you can do the do
And you know this, flow with this, Polo, you know kid
Tame, what's the status on the blunt meter homey?
(Yeah I got three dimes, six Phillies, and some Olde E)
Yeah G you know the program, it's so damn ridiculous
Kickin this mix for all the niggas and the tricks
El the first half, Tame indeed is on ?
And word to life he rhyme with spite and so dynamite
""Dynamite soul!"" (4X)

Yo this flow goes to all the hoes I ever fucked with
Kids I smoked blunts with, and my ex-girl that sucks dick
Niggas takin shorts in weed spots because they know me
And to my moms, because she makes good cheese and macaroni
And to the stores that'll sell three Phillies for a dollar
To Afrika Bambaata for makin me a rap scholar
And MC El for rhymin with this notty headed lunatic
You always knew we had the crew that had the mad drama kid
Peep it, all my peeps from 
12 Block
 to Broad Street
And backstreets in Jersey where the niggas first heard me
It took a long time comin with more cuts than Jason
Since the days I had a fade and used to rock in Redman's basement
I do +Poetic Justice+, like Janet played the role
And now I'm makin suckers swoll with the dynamite soul
""Dynamite soul!"" (8X)
	Remember them joints, we used to rock at the spot?
	When we stepped on stage with fat gear and it was mad hot?
	Kids in competition was scared at the sight
	Of these mad motherfuckers who rock the mic RIGHT
	Then we was ""That's Them"", gettin all the action
	Fuckin niggas bitches and just leavin them in traction
	Ask who the hell was them niggas that's rippin it?
	You better get hip, cause Artifacts got the shit
	For about four years, people said we couldn't hack it
	but the track's got ?, and rhymes got the knack
	See, we'll never fall we got support from the fam
	Jam after jam, here we are but there we stand
	It took mad time, but here we is, in the music business
	Press record when you hear me on KISS
	Brothers talk shit, but yo, who really cares?
	Tame's who all I need cuz, the brother's right there
	And if you're swoll, say it's all in control
	The Artifacts, we got, the dynamite soul

It goes like this then it goes like that
Artifacts yo we rap mad facts without no feedback
Bust a niggy down and clowns ? check my footmark
El sparks the dutch, quicker than the ? to God
Greater darker than Vader, state of the art don't start
My skills mad thrills while you're still cheap, like K-Mart
Ain't smart, mothereffer deffer all get aten
Steppin with my rap weapon, now who's testin?
This Mister El, sinister Brick City minister
Swingin with my nigga Tame, Boom Skwad adventure
Loc style, to the max, tax cats with no doubt
Bust your whole shit out, drunken with my chi style
Diesel Don, ism Gov'na rated all-stars
Up to par, baby pah, ease a Heine from the bar
When I'm with my peeps, we be deep for the shows
Rockin low pro, in the corner shootin cee-lo
Huff puff enough to keep your eyes bloodshot
Get more cocker spaniel move your ass like Daniel
To the left I step, super def, human being
Tame get on the mic, with the one two three and

Pass off, I blast off, like Jetsons when I'm flexin
X'n wack tags and rap fags in ANY fuckin section
Watch the notty head G-Wiz get biz, word to Muensters
Peace to Daddy Reef and Money Stuntsa
A-Cool, my nigga Fat G roll the spliff
Jay Burnz and Mellow Max, my man Swift takes the flicks
A Hooterville killer with +Wild Styles+ like the movie
I light blunts with my right, in left I keep a toolie
The Boom Skwad president, ain't hesitant to represent
Elements that's relevant, diss bitches for the hell of it
I got much pride, electrin SLIDIN suckers backwards
Like Mike Jackson, throwin hats, the Artifacts hittin
G off, so won't you be off, because I'm peed off
Enough to fuck some stuff up, and rip another rough cut
My crew's paid mad dues, without no reimbursement
Verse after verse, the mic be Howlin like a Thirstin
And we out.. FUCK DAT!

What Goes On?,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,1995,"Beyotch! Bitch! Ho bitch!

What goes on?
What goes on baby what goes on? (7X)

What goes on girl, you riff and you riff about
Brothers callin you a bitch, but tell me would you switch
Into shame, how one dame, can make a name for all
I guess it's like that when all the chips fall
It's critical stereotypical how they diss you
It ain't you that chill cause you know your status is true
Girls be trickin, on a mission listen what's it for?
All you get is people dissin callin you a whore
But I guess you don't stress it cause you just keep goin
Hoein and hoein thinkin you're sinkin kids for dough and
At the same time you whine how we call you this
Or that, it beez that way, givin me no play
Kickin facts and all that, diss em about the schisms
Who riff, when brothers call em ho or a bitch
And if you think we're wrong, give me a gong, word is bond
And all I gotta ask is what goes on?

What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

I call em as I see em
Steamin on the scheamin as I kick this
Fitness with the quickness bout the gutter snipe type bitches
Flippin like switches and don't be knowin niggas pedigree
You better be ready, I like +Sleepin With the Enemy+
My remedy is any G, fuck em and flee
I shoot the breeze at the skeeze, just because +The P is Free+
Don't try to play me baby yo, you must be crazy
Tryin to fade me with no clippers when I know you got some other niggas
Just keep it real, word is bond we'll get along fine
I know that you're on mine, I peeped it for a long time
High saditty bitties, that's out for the price tag
? get bagged, and be the victim of a right jab
So if you walk like a bitch, talk like a bitch, it's on
But what goes on?

What goes on baby what goes on? (4X)

You in a relationship? Aight, well cool, we can do this
We start with a kiss and go right down the list
Analyze this, check it how we always spend time
Hittin all spots, bend it up every time
I give you what you want, even more if you ask
Just a small task, any spell you cast
But on the down low, you're hittin that bro, doin the same thing
Skeezin, but what's the reason for the treason?
That's why you're left all alone and you say we're wrong
Sing the song along, tell me what goes on?

This shit here, this is bullshit (hold up hold up hold up)
This is notty for a girl got gats too (I'm sayin)
All you hear now is bitch this bitch that
(cause y'all be actin like that)
What the fuck is goin on? (the fuck you want from me? yo)

Don't catch offense when the gents call you names
If you ain't one, don't sweat it hon, it's just one of them thangs
In my slang, unless you catch a fit from hearin bitch
If the shoe fits, then wear it, I'm not dissin for the credit, get it
Not every girl's a bitch, yeah that's true
Like my Ma Dukes, but oh yes, the rest I seem to talk to
Are shady and not really the ladies they claim to be
It's crazy, everywhere I go, it seems the same to me
That's up until I'm gone
But on the way home I'm still thinkin, what goes on?

We're about to come get nutty up in here
Artifacts, nine-six tricks
Sean J. with the beat
Complete, with the Artifact techniques

I like to rip off mics and clock off dice that roll funny
Getting blunted off somebody's ho money
Honeys beeping for me for cheese, ease back
Please keep that weave intact
Best believe that Tamer D'll be back
Get the weed sacks relax, fuck a flick from Blockbuster
I'ma touch ya, proving who got the bomb like Russia
Friendly neighborhood rap hood, with goods
Could it be?  Yes, no question
(""Tame One"") Now let's start up the session
Kick a rap out til I black out, check out when I wreck out
Throwing backs out, laughing out loud when niggas crap out
Me I want more G's than the LAPD
From when I wrote my first rhyme in eighty-three
With each speech released I reach mad blocks
Analyzing more spots than Matlock
Now I got this rapping shit on padlock
You only half-rock, my shit returns like resurrections in religion
Was fucking with the fact we only bullshitting

Yo El - Sinister Brick City minister

One two, yo
Start taking notes, stating all quotes
Niggas couldn't see me through an optometrist scope
Open, by the rhythm MCs that's hardest
New Jerusalem, Artifacts be the oddest
Main target, crews who think they bringing the news
Who's this? Kicking in your Benz-y box crisp
As long as the Boom Skwad is hearing me clear
There ain't another rapper here that's gonna G this year (yeah)
Lyric for lyric we exhibit mass appeal
Staying real like Erick Sermon
Drunk off the funk like it was bourbon
Rolling up Big Willie like Suburban, Blazers make a wager
Tamer blows up like a pager
Making you wake up early, tell your girlie turn my tape up
Wait up, let me lace up the place like boots
Make loot, and Proceed to rock like Roots
I tear the roof off, and when I fuck don't take my boots off
I shoot from the lip, and make your nose glow like Rudolph
You soft, so let me hit you off with all the hardness
Artifacts shit, we got the hard shit regardless

Punks pop junk, Tame and the Sensei leave 'em all beat

Many ask how I be making up my shit
Like the format and how it don't match or fit
I just, dig into the X-Files of styles
Hitting while you're missing I'll prove that the child
Be on the different angles strangle those who wanna tangle
With the, Flexi With the Technique ripper
El Da Sensei what the men say in the back?
Thinking that we can't battle rap in combat
Cease that, realize that the Facts don't mess
Around when we bless sounds down for any test
So bring your nine and your vest
'Cause when you step to these men, your plan best to be correct
Interject with intellect, each step steady
Dissing those who pose with beef that's petty

Who wanna battle (The Artifacts)? No one",https://genius.com/Artifacts-art-of-facts-lyrics

The issue got a barcode on funkmode
So now I pack a trunkload of skunk, for the underground chumps

Watch me back them up from all the way from New Jeru
To Manhattan (Manhattan) satin and silk, kill the best built
I guess the milk was no good, so now I'm classified a true hood
Check this nigga, live on Kodak tits

It's us, fresh in the flesh, up in your session
Wildin out like sex without protection
Right before your eyes I'ma rise up and size up
The status of the rappers while I sit in the back, smokin my cabbage
Managin, not to get involved with the pet-ty
We ever ready, cuttin comp like a mach-ete

And make the funds for my late night weed runs
Dum dums, wanna do bids and start they static
They better ease back like Kraftmatic

How we react on wax, DJ included exactly
Autographs in black books, dodgin from the crooks

Underneath from deep in the depths of NJ

I be the one to get the job done, Tame One
Got funk like the Bop Gun, burnin with the powers of a hot sun
Makin my mark after dark like I'm a criminal
Break hard rocks to minerals like, ten star generals

Ain't no hurtin' me, certainly, personally
This verse'll be the hottest shit out since Mercury
Check it, I deserve respect child because I project styles
More mysterious than the X Files
I can build and expand on it
Some got 'Five on It', fuck it, I got a hundred grand on it

Really y'all niggas feel me when we step on the spot
Lyrics on cock, stroke and pop, open crews that's hopin'
That the punishment ceases MC with masterpieces
Out to burn so learn, and check this fat thesis
X's and O's, diagrams, shit to flow
Cram expertise the bro, nigga from the East so
As we start to shine, brothers get the dick

leaves my competitors shook
No matter what groups you book, I still jam like Sam Cooke
Took a whole click out, and had the soundman flippin
Kickin wicked freestyle to shit on niggas with the writtens
Check my computer type graphics, niggas get they ass kicked
Quick if they try to flip like ashes, I'm
Never passive, as is, yo you see the flow yo what happened
Check out them niggas rappin
The clap of the crowd be showin me love like Cupid
Loop it back, shit slams like I dished off to Shaq
My crew stay strapped with battle raps on cap
We ready to clap on chaps who make up half you sucker rap acts
I'm intact with facts, MC's can't compete with these treats
And Shawn J P. with the beats,
 
unleash
Talents, balance, styles extra-ordinary
With the vocabulary, no other buries
We know schematics on rapper's theatrics
Only a few can freak status
Artifacts Technique Can freak from here to Dallas,
 
leavin you to clean up
Like Alice

shit's thick like smoke from out the chalice
The weak we em-barr-ass, showin no pity on your city
We either play you live or have you taped in like MIDI (who)
The Brick City Committee comin through a nigga soundset
This round's for all our niggas that didn't get down yet
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
From off the back of the bus, the 31 Bumrush
Crews we breeze through, you don't know, you need to
Tell the soundman, don't touch nothin but the EQ

Deafenin, lethal weapon steppin with the props
Seekin through your sale racks and peepin all mall cops
In to win, tall like, Paul Bunyan, the bass line's drummin
Meanin that the Notty Headed Nigguz comin
Lights, camera! Act like you wanna bring the dra-ma
I make it hotter than all of Atlanta, ready to act up
My Hooterville upbringin is swingin upon ya son
Gunnin for your under the name of Tame One
Yo, eyes focused, lips ready to toke it
You'll choke on my skit, your dilemma is to quit
Flip scripts, who's the winner takin out all beginners
In an instant, my style's polished and stain resistant
The E&J sipper blunt ripper nigga flips your bitch ass
With better effects, we go to war like George Lu-cas
Toucan Sam and we be the Mister Man simply put
Your twelve inch could barely make a foot
We got bombs, my momma told me no when I was younger
But I told her, ""I don't cry on no shoulders I'm a soldier""
Let me show ya, how we can rock a crowd like Ayatollah
Check the folder (here we go check it out right now)
Now you got the scoop, check the Guess troop low

Where Yo Skillz At?,That’s Them,1997,"Artifacts be the best in this MC fest
Rest any intentions we here to mention we the fresh
Newark natives, Polo king bringin the zing
To your Walkman, check it how we talk and sing
Breakin that thing, lyrical jackin, mackin
All so-called cypher rappin niggas I'm smackin
No tricks with fits inflict the hurt like Frank Thomas
To never make the wack jams, to my peers I promise
Atomic, yet, niggas gonna have to respect
What we're bringin to the table check my dialect
Alphabeta, wetta, than your man who says he can
Take a whole block, we put that ass on lock and
Styles be groovy, fake niggas can't fool me
Cause I'm a fly brown brother and you can't school me
Tools be, always sharpened for MC's that be startin
Up shit, and can't fuck with, this rap sargeant
Bluffin, talkin bout nothin, in fact
These crews be wack, so may I ask, where yo skillz at?
Chorus

It's no doubt what I'm about bustin yo shit out with my lyrical
Smokin botanicals I be the man that makes the miracles
Invisible if need be, see me on TV and on CD
Smokin beadies in 3-D doin graffiti
My mechanical style, interlocks rocks and shocks
Cause I'm hot, 
X marks the spot like Sadat
 watch
I'm so tight with mine, nickel and dime rhymers
Are smokin one quarter pushin off the corner from foul line
Prime time teams rewind and can't find mine
They all left behind because my rhymes lack guidelines
Wings get pushed back from hairlines to asscracks
So check ASCAP, on Artifacts soundtracks
So act ill, I can peel a skill like fresh bills
Crack a rapper like a Phills
 I smack more ass than Benny Hill
But chill a minute, I'm all up in it infinite potential
Newark, Jew Jersey resedential areas I turn to burial plots
For MC's, who don't believe what I conceive
Or leave a whole team speechless, gettin jives to Chucky Cheese
I'm like Jesus to the mic, 
write My Life out like Mary
I'm oh-Blige-d to J
. any ghetto queen that's sanitary
Don't play me too close, you'll get roasted by the human torch
From Newark, I'm blowin up spots without tour support
I distort thoughts, with izm sticks and quarts
Laughin at rappers who come at me in soft packs like Newports
I walk that talk, get down and dirty like New York
That's why I'm still fat, beef kill that, nigga where yo skillz at?
Chorus

But, back to the subject at hand
Peep my battle plan and I'll be forced to chop that hand
Off soft brothers yo they can't withstand
The pressure, prepare the stretcher and the Dristan
Cause in nine-six, these MC's can't miss
If you purchase this, then you see why brothers kinda pissed it's
The Mr. Flip Lipper always stayin dipped
Always talkin shit, always hittin hallways and shit

I play the parks after dark and spark L's until my head 
bust
And then bust, 
plus when I get dusted you'll get messed up
Rollin with razors neighbors hate me cause I'm famous
Tame is accurate back with battle raps fat like battleships
Constantly open like a hood rat that's smokin
Got bitches in Hoboken overdosin off my potions
Wet like oceans
, my notebook looks atrocious
Be dissin vocal coaches I don't let them hit my roaches
I handle my Biz like Warner
Brothers be on the corner talkin gossip, hot cause they ain't got shit

Return to Da Wrongside,That’s Them,1997,"I was out to bomb like Vietnam, but in this rhyme, I'm the prime suspect
Handcuffed for stuff that I ain't hit yet
It seems the neighborhood block watch got open like a box top
Wanted they're props and called up the cops
While Momma Dukes is in the kitchen flippin
Trippin cause spray caps is missin and I left without permission
I got bagged with the darkest black marker I had
An easy target cause my tag is on my bookbag
As I was shadowed they musta heard the bag rattle
Tipped the cops off, and ran up, before I popped the top off
Got interrogated bout crews I never heard of
Got my face wrote on, and treated like I did a murder
Heard sermons, on property value and city workshops
Slapped with a fine, now in my record there's a new notch
The misdemeanor catcher comin back at cha
For the long ride, as we return to the wrongside

Out to burn, rackin paints by the sack to provide
Tracks as we return to the wrongside
Art programs and more hip-hop jams, must arrive
As we return to the wrongside
More better styles and wack writers step aside
Aerosol ride, as we return to the wrongside
Newark, New Jers - Brick City we reside
Big up, to BS, as we return to the wrongside
Once more, we have in store graffiti folklore
In depth to score points, what this joint for?
All graffiti writers, we bring justice, to this
Art we take to heart but they missed
The actual Facts, paint with fat caps, artistic
Gestures, flat or gloss be the texture
If you measure the amount or count TV, shows on graf
Galleries, droppin all the skill calories
They crackin down to make us back down
But we still wreckin, who remember King 67?
Peace to Insta, buildin a mad tag in December
Protective shell los for the winter
Get in the subject, on how they say we suspects
Harass me for a marker, there he goes with a Tec
Blind to see wreck, cause they ignorant to check
The true art so, they pass laws just to catch
Certain writers, most bite us anyway
L-S-B-S, L-T-D is on the path subway
Try to bring an understanding, respect we're demanding
Wrongside tales, we never fail with the plannin
Fatter jams on the air must arrive
The weak can't slide as we return to the wrongside
More joints on tape, less compromise
Better in size as we return to the wrongside

Toys bite my tags, throwups, and old pieces
Thowin crews up, they can't be down with, and catchin beatings
Me and my crew stay close-knit
Make niggas say 'Oh shit!' about our dope shit, takin cities in doses
With a tag here and a tag there next year
It'll be everywhere, catch me if you dare
It's rare for me not to have a marker after dark
Cause I've been in this to win this since niggas used to say spark

Yo, I got the black book designers and the bag
Make sure I got the uni for the on tour tag
Saying that we cause mad terror in the city
Kids ain't got shit so, we feels no pity
On any surface, hurtin it, experts in it
Create with the Krylon, crafts be fantastic

Artistic misfits, gifted wicked with the sketchbook
And the paint, maintainin the status top rank
With ink stained hands, I masterpiece master plans
With cans we came across diss some toys who crossed me off
Lost in my thought, I can walk a mile on style it's
Been a while but I keep mechanicals on file
For every new jack, and non-believer not knowin my background
From jump, sleepin cause they only see me with blunts
My ghetto cartoons just express how I feel
Representin my culture, and not off it is the deal
I'm so ill with skill and I'm still up to par
Not your everday rap star, just who we are
Like conquering lions, we do our things with strong pride
For the long ride, tellin tales from the wrongside

KRS keeps the stage show live
Sharper than knives, as we return from the wrongside
PNB Nation, no hesitation
Blazin, as we return from the wrongside
Peeps sleep, while these brothers coincide
Keep in stride, as we return from the wrongside
Comp hide, toy niggas take a dive
Kickin skills live, as we return from the wrongside
Uhh, it's like that
Layin shit down on the map

Like this like that, so whatchu want?

If I had it my way, every wack MC would die Friday
Makin Saturday a better day
Sunday wouldn't start your week off til Monday
One day tunes I wrote yesterday will be tomorrow's scriptures for today
At high noon, Boom Skwad Gods with knowledge
Holler at apostles, who squalor in despair, despisin those who follow
Swallowin pride like St. Ide's while you stare... take a drink
Don't think in a eyeblink I won't start my hijinks
And hijack a flight 
Tomorrow night, cause off the record with the treble and the bass
I chase my lyrics through the rap race
Last place is simply not an option in my case
Waste not want not because I front not
The Notty keeps his lyrical shotty cocked
And locked up at your temple, over instrumentals
(""It's all in your mind"") you No. 2 like the pencil
The Boom Skwadron, Godson, who got the Bop Gun
The top gun, from the jump like Datsun
I got one, candy-coated rote rhymes skits I shit on when I get on
Then flip the scripts like I had Zips on
It's on like electrical, my symmetrical
Alphabetic keeps my competition ridin on my testicles
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit, ain't nobody shit"")
You to the rescue, let me test you
Who the best crew, most definite
Has to be the Skwad cause I'm the President
All you misrepresenters with your twelve inches need pinches
Wake the fuck up and check out what this is
(""he ain't shit, you ain't shit, your momma ain't shit, ain't nobody shit"")
I can't see nuttin but victories
MC's think they can get to me, then bring it
Cause once I pass the blunt to my Lieutenant then we in it
For the infinite, no play play
The notty headed Newark nigga from NJ and the Sensai
Represent fully, playin bullies out for yappin
Thinkin you'll be rappin, get tapped and say you scrappin
While I been waitin hatin fake MC's that make they bacon
With passion, rippin up they stickers for reaction
Practicin on rap has-beens, I'm down with the Biz like Backspin
Dissin Mikes like the Jacksons
Thick like the lips on that Fugee chick
Hard like the dicks in booty flicks
Dissin niggas like a snooty bitch (trick)
I only pop a coochie if it smells Gucci
Get the lucci hit it for months and then smoke blunts with the hoochies
(""What's the flavor Dunn"" - Tame)
You know the flavor like blue cheese
On how I make crews bleed and school MC's who try to do me

Please follow it's instructions to a T

You may, purchase the Redman album, the first one
Listen to the song ""How to Roll a Blunt""
But until then, you shall learn

I use my Colt 45 to shoot down your Olde English
By the time that I'm finished I peel the caps off six Guinness
Skwad Training helps me to peep a sucker's weakness, like
Telling your secrets, or kicking it to your freakses
You couldn't go there with directions
I make crews break out like skin infections from my rap lethal injections
(Notty headed terror)
Hoes get caught up in my web like flies
One look at my red eyes, Tricks jump into backflips like Jedis
Black little rascal dissin dips at White Castle
Got love doctors baffled why bitches ride me like a saddle
(How does he do it?)
Is it live or Memorex when I be on deck
Loose from deuce deuces from the neck and then I jet
Et cetera, catch my rap and after that kick back
Competitors could rap, but they recycle like six-packs
(robo-nigga)
Wack ain't the word for ya, NIGGA, I never heard of ya
So turn it down a notch or two or watch my crew murder ya

Yo hold the phone, tone niggas like That's raps are prone
To dissasemble members only who think they're grown
See, we're from the Bricks where tricks hustle for dick
DKNY, MC's think they rhyme styles be fly, I
Bear witness, that, we bring the crispiness
Exquisite, prolific, the two that brew the gifted
Or uncanny, playschool the days who misbehave
Pray their handy, MC's wreckin niggas with the dandy
Style so peep the tech, X be the brand called seb? and
These niggas from New Jerus is next on hand
Formulate rhymes, create lines, collaborate
With the DATs and mindstate, that makes your braincells ache
Niggas get dissed in the cut, now they finished
Advantage to the victor all crews be diminished
You will continue rolling your blunts, in a counter-clockwise fashion
(wack MC's, they all get the dick)
Gripping it firmly, yet loosely at the ends, twist it
In a counter-clockwise motion
No cheating, no Easy Wide will be distributed
You will be based to rely your skills on pure instinct...
(next up)

Tame One be rockin on cloud nine with rhymes that flow frequent
Peep how when I speak I freak sequins
Henceforth I piss MC's off more often, I'm the boss
Hittin my blunts dipped in secret sauce

B-ball treats, dance on treats like neats rapper that's fleet
Step on competiton with my hollowtip cleats
Past the rumors, that, the Artifacts got lazy that's crazy
Makin joints that make your thoughts hazy

Morocco Mole MC's can't see me with they specs on
Gassed up like Getti watch me blow spots like Exxon
I'm Unfuckwittable like Jamal and George Clinton
The Ex-West District politician like Gibson

Dissin those who missin blows, kick shit to program
A instrumental jammer by the mental blow's manner
Vicious, Delicious with the Vinyl fuck bitches
Who got dreams and wishes for niggas to feed em fine dishes

We sabotage your entourage with a barrage of lyrical cheapshots
At your weak spots, sleep not
This style spits on MC's like I do beatbox
In my size nine Reeboks, I'm Cummin' Thru Ya Fuckin' BLock

MC's perish from the shit that we deliver
Giver of a script to play it like Frank Gifford
Fools with no tools get dealt with from the belt tip
Who else is higher from the first to get melted
Exactly, no match, niggas puttin caps on my raps
Actually, broads ain't naturally, fit
Fakin jax, blow styles on the map
Artifacts, bringin back, that shit that niggas lack!

Time
(Yeah, niggas don't know the time)
Put your blunts down
(So, if you wanna roll with us and be down)
Those of you who have rolled your blunts correctly
(Check the sound y'all)
May pass on to a much higher state
Those of you who fucked up
Get an F in fetal blunt
(with the corruption, niggas be... bust men)
For those ridiculous ass holes, and those ridiculous canoe
You got burnin

You stay back
(Fuckin up in your shit in football and b-ball)
This is the Boom Skwad president signing off

Antagonist with scripts, be from the Bricks perfect

But you're knowing that can't fuck with the mathe-matcian
When I rip and tip-in rebounds with mounds of work
Jerks get down, cause they know we hurt the sound
So ease as I please these OG's with seeds that

My theoretical medical rhetoric is terrible, but bearable
Instead of sheddin wool, I'm takin sedatives

And I got some fast assed styles, so go and chase one
Hah, you lose from takeoff, so break off your shake off

With the wettest, test this, deadly like asbestos
Check the credit set it, so odd they have to call a medic
My paragraphs be off key, that's why niggas can't get it

On freeze like Sub-Z doin MK3 fatality
Do remember like Clue, I run up on booty crews
On every weekend buggin out cause I be geekin
Lounge like the peppermint the Boom Skwad President
Leaves a tenament resident finding evidence of sedatives
DAILY, scoopin through the Roots like Alex Haley
Beetle Bailey beatdown to a soundman lookin scary

Make a pick-up, and then escapes from New York like Snakeplitzkin
With trees tied to the thighs of down shorties clearing Customs
Ready to cuss and bust on any nigga fuckin with production
(This ain't my bag)
Back in the Bricks tricks and kids dig the music as we dooz it
(God damn yo!)
And lose it, when we play niggas the new shit
(That's that shit!)
Cross this T, watch me dot your eye
Stay on your P's and Q's, niggas I've mastered my high
And when the snake bites and hype blinds your eyesight
At last, the Artifacts, will bug and have the last laugh
We're comin through all studio sessions
Bringin 40 motherfuckers, pissin all over your conference tables

Like this right here
Rhyme style criminal, with the lyrical missile
Wack niggas the issue bless, catchin wreck, to your chest
Rock even Budapest, who the best, on the spot
Blitzin niggas wicked from the cornerback, slot for props
MC's pop, but run up close into my strategy
Task be, easily complete major catastrophe
I be the rhymin holocaust, with the sauce to toss
Those who fakin jacks in rappin know they fallin off
Is it the way we lay the forte, display my caliber
Slayin my challengers, used to be a dancer, now a flow, balancer
Manufacture raptures, dip into my tricks
Pullin out treats, and singles comin by the hits
Shit done by Vic, units for the nine-six
MC El the Sen, with Da Way Like This
We kickin over your crossaints
Smackin your secretary up and kickin up that fuckin computer
We snatchin all the paper from fax machines
And we stoppin distribution on your next release, HUH?

What makes you think that we can't start beef in a heartbeat
Like car thiefs with snatchers
Givin rappers hot flashes for actions of our main access
Knockin out you half-rockin-my-jocks on your asses, like Cassius
But cautious, these dope rhymes'll leave you nauseous
(Still niggas sleep but umm, we still got the)

Picture perfect workin, expert that hurts it
Anyone with the verse, that shit gets bursted
Exploit the time, simplify tracks, I rap
For brothers on the block and those who buy me off the rack
Attack foes who slip up off the earth
Jot down the plot as this MC, gets into that ass
The bass thickens, while crews face their whippin
Always on the low but, you'll never see me slippin",https://genius.com/Artifacts-this-is-da-way-lyrics

Wrong Side of da Tracks (LP version),"Wrong Side Of Da Tracks [12"" Single]",1994,"I'm out to bomb like Vietnam under the same name Tame One
The bad one, ink flow master bastard with the Magnum
I tags up quick, and then I steps to the exit
When it's time to get sefted or flex on some fresh shit
Some wack crook stole my black book I know who took it
I know his whole tag because the fag writes his name crooked
The ink I use might stink, but you gotta think
I got my props Hoppes, cause my tags don't shrink
I'm taggin and baggin bitches cause my name, is famous in the street
Cause they know my name's from cruising in the Jeeps
So yo, grab a can and put your man up and stand up
For the fresh never stale niggas off the third rail
Deep dark and black like the Magnum I pack
It's that Artifacts chat from the wrong side of da tracks
 repeat 2X
The Artifacts are from the wrong, side of da tracks
The Artifacts are from the wrong side

I load my backpack with spray paint Girbaud couldn't spark the
Tagging up a train I catch the pound take a trip
To the train yards and think back, when I used to write that
Shit that used to hit, had all the mad color tips
Breakin was my thing I used to spin the back
I never thought I'd spin the wax, with tracks to make your hands clap
I could've went the other way but no haps
I got my dap on the map with the Bic down to a spray cap
Niggas used to doubt to my clout but now I turn em out
They shout my shout out uptown, like they wanna be down
Avoid the crowds that wanna stab me in the back enough of that
Watch the third rail track, cause I don't wanna get zapped
Pieces I burn to show my name no shame
Don't wanna put the blame down on my nigga Tame
Brothers don't wanna see me grow to get my cash flow
I have no remorse, so check me out in The Source
 (2X)

I burn my name up quick like a Thai stick
As red as my eyes get I still rocks the fly shit
Back with some ultra flat black catchin wreck in a sec
Wet paint, ain't shit, when I'm on the set
I'm live like the third rail, on time like a fast train
The name Tame alone got fame so f**k a last name
I tags mad when I drag a fat sack of ism
Comin out with New Editions like Mike Bivins
I get a sticker from my nigga with the bag of em
Write my name on em then I peel off the back of em
And stick em to victims of underground systems
Let the toys bring the noise, me and my boys are gonna diss em
In conclusion don't snooze when two niggas from the Jerz
Kick the mad graffiti slurs and kick the bass to the curb
The Artifacts Jack, bringin the art of facts back
Some seem to forget about the ebony that caught wreck
So remember this you're tender when you slip in to enter
The Artifacts zone cause graffiti's still growin
To kick ass pizazz slash let me tag
Why is that black? Because the wack jack was known as a fag
So don't cross the path that's the gat to your back
The Artifacts out, wrong side of da tracks

Brick City Kids,UnKnown,1997,"In the rhyme we trust, bust lyrical action
Ripping like traction, addition subtractin'
Acts who rap through, another man vision
The lively, MC, on your television
With the true art smart, of start fool harty party
Hardy smarties, who can't shine against deez, degrees
Bust kids across the mouth
With the style that I'm about, funny talk like down south
(For real) Relentless, with a twist, divine and on time
And off beat, with a pocket full of ?tee climb?
Boundaries, rivalries and such, popping three in the clutch
Get tightrops like double dutch, much
And anticipated, T plus T equals the minerals
Prolong the sequal for your review
See through, all those who play like glass
Get my ass on route and take the transit that's max
	If you don't know who's in this end
	Nigga you'd better think twice about the Brick City Kids
	Puff mad iz, fuck who you are
	Bringing down fools is all our troopers are   (Repeat 2x)

I'm all about the weed vapors and papers
1-800 pagers and the stages
Hit live spots before the rap pages
All of us say this is worth the top dollar
So I hollar, using MC's as Rhodes Scholars
I don't bother playing Godfather
I'd rather just jam like Bambaataa, give me room like the Ramada
I gotta go for broke, no jokes, I get open off that weed smoke
Making God nod like I'm the pope
We wrote, half my wild book and shook crooks
Now my pager's got more flavors inside of it than a cookbook
Look, I can't get took, like some book of rotten Brooklyn
I go do paperwork like Central Booking
You get your title tooken, fucking with this nigga who be bugging
Showing lovin' like I was your cousin
Super party buzzing like a contact
Rhyme's fat, dimes ask, ""Where that notty-headed nigga fine ass?""
With the wine glass making time pass fast
Muffle on hash out the stash
Boom Squad forever, non-believers won't last
Stepping on your ass get your style before it's smashed
Running through the ""one two's"" bringing down the three the hard way
Day to day, distinguishing my work from just play play
Vibing all day, then relating the information into concepts
Taking small steps to build projects
High tech like internet web sites
Uploading megabytes every time I touch the mic
	If you don't know who's in this end
	Nigga you'd better think twice about the Brick City Kids
	Puff mad iz, fuck who you are
	Bringing down fools is all our troopers are   (Repeat 2x)",https://genius.com/Artifacts-brick-city-kids-lyrics
