Streiht Up Menace,The Best of MC Eiht,UnKnown,"Wake yo' punk-ass up for the '93 shot
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin' house, gyeah
And it ain't nothin' but a Compton thing, y'all
And we ain't nothin' but Nig
gaz On Tha Run
And this goes out to my niggas, gyeah

A fucked up childhood is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn
Hmm, somebody help me
But nah, they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin', 'cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin', and on top of that got Moms sprung
Scheamin' off the top, Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas puttin' brew in my fuckin' baby bottle
Damn! And through all the motherfuckin' pain
They done drove my moms insane
So, I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a streiht up menace, gyeah

Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace

Now I'm of age, and livin' in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm Fil-ia fresh outta high school, never did I wonder
That the motherfuckin' hood would take me under
Gyeah,
 I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin' (Japs)
See a bitch in the right lane, so I comes with the mack
Astro Van pulls a motherfuckin' jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head
Sayin': ""Play that shit cool, and don't be a fool!""
He shot my nigga in the fuckin' head
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm layin' in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk motherfuckers
And my eyes is bloodshot red
Gyeah, motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the streiht up menace, gyeah

Uhh, whassup, y'all?
Streiht up menace
Damn!
Really, really
Streiht up menace
Damn!

I'm in too deep
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep
One-Time's tryin' to do a smooth creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin' one of they hood rats
I ain't got time for the fuckin' bitch's story
Niggas want me gotta come to my territory
And ain't no 'you can get the fist'
Niggas come, and they get done on they own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay, 'cause I don't wanna punk out
Oh what should I do?
The homies say: ""The hood's where it's good
Homeboy, I thought you knew.""
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react, caught two in the chest
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace
, gyeah

Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace
Damn!

And on and on
I guess we outta here

And it ain't nothin' but streiht up menaces, damn!

Welcome to Los Santos,Welcome to Los Santos,2015.0,"Break a solenoid on this one
Yeah, nigga

Welcome to Los Santos
Gyeah
Where it's easy to catch a case
One times patrol with a pic of ya face
Fo' deep in the Lac, that's jack mode
Unaware of the set-neutral dress code
Drive-bys tryna pull grand theft
Bandanas on the antennas, neighborhood deaf
Rats fucking niggas for ends, bitch please
Easily friends turn into enemies
Tryna check a couple dollars but it ain't long
Jealousy in shots if the weight wrong
Stay strong, die well
Growing up in the hood's no fairytale
It's Mad City and can't y'all tell
Welcome to the city where it's dead or jail
Steady eating good, we pull licks
Staying deep like OGs in jail pics
Gyeah, welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Welcome to the land
Straps, a couple birds in ya hand
Gyeah

Welcome to Los Santos (Fly bitches)
Welcome to Los Santos (Get ritches)
Welcome to Los Santos ('s that trippin')
Welcome to Los Santos ()

Yea, where it's easy to get some weight
Hop in the stolen whip and I'll take you straight to the place
That grand theft and robbery mask draped on my face
A cold bastard, closed casket seal my fate
For this almighty dollar dollar
When we're doing what we do you know we do it proper
And all these doctors and psychiatrists can't save me, I'm crazy
Everyday these Los Santos streets gon' pay me
It feel good don't it?
Kush smoke and west coastin' on every hood corner
I drop the top at the beach
Heard it's fun in paradise, yo that's the word on the street
Don't let these palm trees and bitches get you swept off yo feet
I'm staying blazed in these sun rays
Evil seeds getting paid, cradle to the grave
You can try it if you want, it ain't a thing sweet
The weather's fine but it's cold on these rough ass streets of Los Santos
(Dear Los Santos)
Welcome to the land
(Dear Los Santos)
Welcome to the land
( and let me ride)
Put a bird in ya hand
Welcome to Los Santos
(Dear Los Santos
Dear Los Santos
 and let me ride)

Ah, Los Santos
You got it done

Don't get fooled by the palm trees
Fly ass bitches and bomb ass weed
It's real over here on these cold streets
Triple OGs stay about that cheese
Los Santos
We be doing the most
Ow!

Oh yeah, Los Santos
Hey Los Santos
Hey Los Santos
 and let me ride",https://genius.com/Mc-eiht-welcome-to-los-santos-lyrics

MC Eiht, DJ Slip

Thirteen years of age at the time
Moms ain't kickin' in, I gots to get mine

Choose my victim, then mothafuckin' stick him
One more point that got scored for the hood
Up to no damn good, understood?
Snaps is getting low so I gots to get some mo'
Loads up the K, break out the back do'
You know the routine, so punk fool, here we go
Same bat channel, keep your mothafuckin' hands up on the dash
And gives up the cash

And if you ain't down with The Hype, fuck you
You're coming up short when I'm stomping
So when I hit your corner, you're gonna be a goner
Nigga duck when my nine starts to buck
In it for the snaps so I'm crazy as fuck
I should be laying low cause one time is real hot
Need to make a knot so I rush your spot
And it's like that when I got the feelin'
If you don't kill, somebody else does the killin'
So when you hit the end of the road ain't no turning back
I done signed a hood lifetime contract
Jackin' and packin' cause ain't shit funny

One time sleep on the fucking night creeper
Trying to show stop on the sales
Pull fake braids but I still gets paid
Just say no? Fuck the TV
Trying to push the shit cause the weight is exceeded
See me for the blast, Five-oh fly in fast
Mad cause I'm making more cash than they ass
Now I lay low in the cut
Label me the nigga with the fucking gangsta strut
Every hooptie got gold license plates
My birds fly out throughout the fucking states
Now my other half is telling me I'd better quit
But I ain't through in this shit, so I guess this is it
I'll be dead before I go out like a dummy

Ay wassup?!
Haha
Y'all jump on in
It's my homeboy Crooked I
I'm Dresta Tha Gangsta kna 'mean?
We supposed to pick up my homeboy Eiht
I wan' try to hit him up right now to see what's happ'nin
(Verse 1 by Dresta)
I know you love it, the most rugged Mc's, out the Gate
It's Dresta with them drunkest Crooked I and the Eiht
Oh-Oh, 2 Compton niggas known for freakin 'em right
Man, Crooked late at night got 3 and they tight
In the Bourbon, swervin', do Irvine try'na catch Eiht
So we can hook him with the 3rd fine lady
Named Mercedes, got a body like a 'Maserati'
Thinkin to myself:'I must be crazy! Tryna give away this hottie!'
Now I glance at the passenger seat
Can't deny that this girl by my side was just too damn fly
Too Jeopardized, I just glanced at her eyes
And them caramel thighs make my main man rise
Can't wait to re-arrive at the 'tele
So I can lick them honey off that ring on her belly
For so', I glance in the mirror once mo'
Loc, I gotta catch Eiht cause I know he gon' love this ho
(Chorus)
Real G's get lonely
We can have fun but bring some for the homie
(Sweet Black Pussy)
I only fuck with real niggas only
We can have fun but bring some for the homie
(Sweet Black Pussy)
(Verse 2 by Mc Eiht)
I gives a damn how these hoes tryna floss these days
Cause they still gets the nuts, fucks tramps and sluts
I must have kill it, the way you want me, ride the pony
'Secrets' like Toni(Braxton), members only
Dresta, I heard they turn in tricks for bucks
2 tricks get the dicks hard, ready to suck
Don't be havin me in suspense, but in the meanwhile
I be dippin up in the LB with C-Style
Back to the CPT, home bud and Tanquerina
Beatin' up the pussy like Ike(Turner) beat up Tina(Turner)
You know me, the gangsta love'll never wine and dine
Keep it tight, anytime I fuck it like 
Lately the Hype, I know it ain't right
3 a.m. I ring your phone every night
Let's play house, no cat and mouse
Don't floant it, Eiht just give it how you want it
But in the end don't press your luck
Because ain't no bitch like the bitch I fucked!
(Chorus)
(Verse 3 by Crooked I)
Fuck the bullshit, the pimps at the pool pit
I know that you want chips but dick is all you get
I knock them skins out like always trained by custom auto
Never givin' a bitch shit, that's a hustlers motto
Except sumptin' to swallow
Now your boyfriend wanna follow
Hit a nigga with a hollow tip and fuck the bitch tomorrow
I can never be your simp, trick!
I'm slappin bitches with 9 inches, the limp dick
Plus a pimps dick
Dig short, small, diggin 'em large and tall
Y'all the bigger they are the harder they fall
I fuck 'em all!!
The ho-philosopher, broke, dope and popular
Still strokin' , now goin deeper than Ocean (??)
I got your 'bra, gettin ready for the pony ride
Doggy-style, so I can hit the backsiiiide
Grab the head pump that ass in the air
What did you know?
The ho hollered:'how ya do dat dere?!'

You fucked up when you tried to blast on this trigger
Nigga didn't smoke my ass with the
Fuckin blood runnin down my back
I pull the muthafuckin strap on the sneak attack, uh
Load the hollow points into the hot Glock
Got my eyes on the crib at the end of the block
Don't give a fuck who's inside
His little sis' caught the fuckin slug so I jumps in the G-ride
Feelin cold as I look at the murder metal
Hear the sirens so I hit the mutherfuckin pedal
Tyres got to spinnin, I can see the smoke
Could barely catch my breath as I start to choke
Off the blood, from the 38 slug that was planted in my back
Damn that was wack
Dip through the back streets so I can slide out
The G-ride to my homie Chills to hide out
Dump the mutherfuckin Glock, it was dirty
Bammed on my nigga door, damn Chill heard me
He opened up the door and I fell straight in
Passed out for a second cause I lost my wind
Woke up to hit the mutherfuckin weed and Chill looked up and said:
""Damn Eiht you bleedin!""
Niggas they pulled the fuckin sneak attack
Fucked around and caught 2 to the fuckin back, geah
Niggas was buckin tried to put me down
Some punk muthafuckas from across town, uh
You won't be chalkin up one for your sorry set
Ain't dead yet
Just label me a deadly threat
Get Boom Bam on the mutherfuckin phone
Get the 19 shot cause nigga it's on
I know the spot where them punk niggas chill
Hit their hood with the big black steel
I do it my way like M.J
Slam dunk these hollow points in you, punk
No time to think about it twice
Leave these muthafuckas in traps and scattered like fuckin mice
Boom Bam meet me at the spot, I'm shot
I don't give a fuck they gon' get got
One time's on my dick, fuck it
Jump out, run through the alley to the bucket
Now the bullet starts to travel, I caught a shiver
But fuck it like the mail man I'll deliver
I hoppes out the bucket and I'm bleedin bad
But fuck it don't sweat it cause I'm too damn mad
Don't give a damn of who's in the line of fire
Grabbed the 'K and kneeled down by the tyre
They bust at me and I bust back
Boom Bam bring up the rear with the fuckin Mac
I buck one in the chest he start to beg
""Let me live""
I slipped, caught one in the leg
My nigga Bam let the mutherfuckin Mac spit
Here comes Tha Chill over the fence, fuck this shit!
I grabbed the 'K and kicked in the front door
90 rounds spittin as I catch 2 more

Board and quarter about a hundred times

But I do it, no hesitation
Fuck it, I'mma violate probation
No one gave a mad fuck about me

Put on the set when I could pick the right color

Strictly for my niggas, so fuck them hoes
No sing no dance, no dance no sing
Just your bald-headed ass with your lips on my big fat thing

Nighty night, motherfucker, take two to the head
Just some more Eiht shit for that punk that I pop

Spittin' you lines of invisible force

And all the kinfolks, and never scuff up my timbos

And mine been froze, I
I toss that ass out a limo window and into limbo
Now go switch up the tempo and murder the stage

Somebody told me
They want some of that thug shit up in here
Gyeah
& I'mma represent it to the fullest
C'mon
For all my CPT G's in the house
Check this out

As my life takes a twirl
I say fuck the world
Cause sometimes it seems
That it's all a bad dream
Pops must have fucked with moms
On the scheme
But sooner or later
He left our 2 man team
But fuck him
Times done changed I'm in the game
And I bring moms pain
Cause the game is slangin caine
Cries from my eyes as I hits the street
Pounds in the chest tha heart beats
As I roll with heats
Pops wasn't around but for a minute or shit
Until he skipped across town
With another bitch to stick
Stuck moms one more times
Then dropped a dime
And on top of that
Had a son same age mine
But, uhh, don't blame me
Cause Lord I try not to
Have an attitude like 'fuck him until I die'
But now I rebel and cause moms hell
And hit the blocks
Cause I'm into makin illegal mail
Gyeah

If you keep your hood tight
Everything's gonna be alright
If you're down then you can ride with me
It's thicker than water baby
Me and you
It's thicker than water baby
So what we gon do

Now I runs with a gang
That Hoo-Bangs for fame
And crosstown robberies know tha nickname
Leave 'em dead in they shoes
As we servin the blues
G's that pack tools pay dues to rule
So it's cool they dumps and we dumps back
Me and my G's and the 6-4 black
Layin 'em flat Rata-Tat-Tat
From the Gat and shit
We represent y'all hit the bricks
When the pistols spit
And I had a straight bitch and shit, that's cool
I slang for cash while she hit the books in school
I live and die for the hood, she knew the rule
Love for this thug when the world would seem cruel
I crips where the enemies dwell but I'm no fool
Undercover drive off strapped with the tool
But I slipped then packed my clip
My hoodrat tripped and didn't scoop
But they still didn't shoot
Gyeah

Chorus 2x

I made it to Deuce-5 baby and that's luck
In this rap shit to try to make some bucks
(ching , ching)
Seems like the gang bang thang got tougher
A little bit younger but then bit rougher
They been tellin me
To watch out for jealousy
Cause now a friend of me was a enemy
Strange the game done changed switched
Ain't that a bitch
With the rivals makin some change
In and outta lanes in the passenger seat
Me and you and our crew strapped with heat
Outta town runs for funs no beef
We all hit licks and blows the chronic leaf
But payback's a bitch in the end you know
And she sets up traps
Cause she snatch for dough
Let it go no come up your last trick
Cause my brother's got my back
When the shit gets thick

Compton Zoo,Which Way Iz West,2017.0,"Niggas premature, wet dream
I'm all for the money, mo' cream
Full head of steam like a chronic cloud
I bang for the west, say it loud
Wild loc, straight out the hood
Niggas calling me Eiht cause the 38 snub
Couple shots now they off and running
Maybe a couple more till the cops start coming
Funny how they floss, broke ass
Loc's in the hall, no pass
Stomp on a couple, old news
Catch em' before they running out they damn shoes
I'm tryna stay paid
Me and my bitch, loc
Sipping on top grade
Shots of the liqour
Money is the plan so I double up quicker
Think it and want it
The shit get thick then roll your dice smarter
And thats the life sometimes
Follow along and read between the lines
Can I get a G'eah, 1 time
Couple of niggas fight G'eah but its still mine
Real shit there, but i'm back
Funny niggas is reppin' so they up under attack
G'eah

Compton Zoo, you know how we get down
Blue Stamp get em'
Compton Zoo, we should examine carefully

I reminisce back when they die to get in
How he died for the cause, ride straight to the pen
What up
Niggas take that ride
Everyday in the struggle nowhere to hide
Drive by music loc you ain't lie
Tried to stay straight, you know I try
Lied to the 1-time's
Got heat in the trunk but it ain't mine
Working and stashing
Couple of clients so I might keep smashing
No thinking what am I to do
Hide the evidence and don't give them a clue
Lifestyles of a nigga in the struggle
Regulate the spot with the neighborhood muscle
No warning, take over ya' spot
The homeboys plot for whatever you got
G'eah you the 1, yo' {racks?}
I split em' with the homies like kick backs
Kick back its real O.G's in the place
Motherfucker so the gat gone squeaze

You better be watchin what you sayin
Cause niggas from 159th ain't playin

For beatin your bitch ass up and down the block

Shit it ain't that hard""

I'mma tell you 'bout the time that we first met
The story that you told was some fake bullshit
It was me and Chill my pal
The scene was like the showdown at the O.K. Coral
It was you and then about five of y'all hangin
Standin in the center lookin like y'all was bangin
(Ain't nuthin but marks)
Approached me with your ""P"" hat
But I was high off the blunt, so I didn't see that
But I'm knowin I'm a nigga you love to hate
But you grab me by my shoulder and you conversate
I shouldn't've fell for it, I should've started slappin
Your eyes always dotted, you best stick to rappin
David Blake: you fake as fuck!
I mack your ass like a muthafuckin truck
I guess that eye was too black cause you still can't see me
Servin me a drink in your khaki bikini
Oh geah, just like I said before
Ain't nuthin but the ho on my dick
Little trick named Quik
Geah, quick to get fucked one time
You better be callin one-time before I pull out my nine
And nigga, checks this
Fill your Lexus full of holes as you slam into poles
Niggas should've just told me that you was a mark and
I wouldn't've hit you up with that notorious park
(You know where we from)
Can't fade it, better fear it
Got one of your little B.G.'s to write your fuckin lyrics
Playin around with the hood you get got
Nick name should be Spot for that eye you got
You and that fake muthafucka who wrote your rap
My nigga Boom Bam gon' slap with the trey-five strap
No muthafuckin truce
Get the ass cracked over the dome with the fuckin deuce-deuce
Don't make me have to act up
Cause you's a frail muthafucka with no back up
Original bangin on wax, nigga, you fake
'member One-Time Gaffled, nationwide blue tape
Original Compton representin to the T
Givin out slugs to you fake wanna-be's
Go run right through you
And before we kill off, remember the 'niew did it to you
Slick talkin, fast walkin
Nigga, how'd you figure that the E wasn't gon' stand and deliver?
You ain't worth a penny
Never had a damn eye, dotted so many
Times, two times, three times
You fall to the floor, you don't want no mo'
And if you wanna get with this you best to dash
Geah, cause I'mma tap that ass

Catching them of guard loc
Revenge is swift, G'eah
Music to drive by so we hitting ya fast
And the nigga to hit first just like the last
Now the beef has past
So it's action first
And the line that comes next
Outcome is worse
Geah

Moving on these suckers
Cause they taking me lightly
Tryna murder me something
If ya anything like me
Outlaw, inlaw everybody getting shot
We don't leave any town
Everybody getting hot
Moving on these suckers
Never taking them lightly
If ya tryna keep it hood
Then ya tryna get like me
Outlaws, inlaws everybody getting shot
We don't leave town

Where - killin' niggas roam
Illegal mobile phones, 4-5's and 9's: that's chrome
Abbreviated sets is where they macks
Crack sales in stacks
Government pay no taxes
If one times roll through they get hit up
No bullet proof vest protects that chest
Blood gets spit up (geah)
You can't believe it like Aids with Eazy
Fools be droppin when I be
Poppin 'em straight lookin' breezy (geah)
Damn why the fuck do they live like that?
How come
Every lil' park boy carry a gat? (I don't know)
Pull car jacks and drive-by's on innocent by (I don't know) standers
Intimidate niggas who can't stand us (geah)

I hits the pedal then i jet
Duckin' while they buckin', I'm buckin' back cause I ain't dead yet
I caught 2 slugs from his chrome (damn)
But he caught 2 slugs in his dome (pop pop)
Now it's time to take me home
And I'm lyin on my back (geah)

And this how we gettin down (The new style in the house)
To the West, my Gz, to the West
To your chest, my Gz, to your chest
We puttin it down
From block to block, to scale this town
]From crooked cops to, dope spots, all around
Uhh, hot poles to six folds of strawberries
Hood's tight like Fort Knox, runnin thru military
Attitudes, don't even try it, Tek 9's
AK's, will be stored in a riot
Quiet as kept, we creep, put you to sleep
No bull-essin, dirty ass Mac 11's keep spittin
Killers they cheat *?that they ass?*
Punk one-times gaffle to my homey Tiny T's battle ground
187's, 211's is for the paper
No ..... kiddin, caps get peeled in the city
E's bringin you the bomba
Ragtops we sell, oh, from Compton to Alandra
Cruisin in my 6-tre wit Eazy-E
Blunt smokin, tryin ta dash from the C-P-D
Do or die for the wicked Westside, who's the best?
Fake the West as I pound it on my chest
Compton is where we do it all day
G'yeah, bitch, oh why you come my way?

Crack sacks to, pull jacksta, down St.Ives bottles

Homies, we're county bound, wit the hot 9's
One-time slam my face to the ground
Hot girls can you set you up
Hollow points, hit the car when, them Compton Gz bust
(Who) can't stand my definition?
Murders I wrote, gats I tote, is my daily day mission
Kids get caught up in the rapture
Wit the murderous styles that they after
Young guns, dumpin to keep it pumpin, gots ta leave sockin
Keep dem 9 mill's rockin
No place is this place I dwell, cross every states
House Compton cell mates
Tossed souls get torn
1-5-9, I represents us the day I was born
Musta been my destiny
Blast to the face so they won't get the best of me
To make a big fat grip (grip)
Land of the, sunshine, Tek 9, we steady dip
Come test me, don't wanna do it, I keeps it jumpin

Hey fool, I shot ya
Domes get delivered on platters
Hot heat from under the seat, fools you better stagger
My Uzi weighs a tonne
Stomp and claimin Compton from, g'yeah, day one
Sometimes I got to thank God
For puttin me in the middle of the land, where homies buck and sqwuab
For life, Compton for life and not for this rap
Stay true to the streets, so Gz get it straight
It just got to be that way
For my Gz that's, why everyday
Sneaks around, to put the buck down
Compton 24/7, g'yeah, stay the hell down

And this one is goin' out to all my homeboys rest in peace
Geah
A crooked childhood it's what the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn, geah
Somebody helped me
But now they don't hear me though
I guess I be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escaping cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin'
And on top of that got moms sprung
Screamin' of the top
Pops never figured
Daddy go down by the hands of another man
Now my pops is goin' that ain't no good
Gotta follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Brothers putting brew
In my damn baby bottle, geah
And through all the stress and the pain
They all drew my mind insane
So I guess I gotta do what so I ain't finished
I grew up to be a streiht up menace, geah
Now I'm of age
And living in the projects
Gettin' paid of the clucks in the county checks
I finish fresh outta High School
Never did I wonder
That - the hood - would take me under
Geah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and it's like that
Off to the corner store owned by the dirty rats
See a freak in the right lane so I comes with a Mac
I stole van, trust a trick, pulls a jack from the back
Now he gots the strap to my homies head
Sayin' playin' cool and don't be a fool
He shot my G in the damn head
I'd caught one in the shoulder if I didn't bail I was dead
Now I'm laying in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about that fool who shot my homie and my eyes are bloodshot red
Geah, punk fools I ain't finished
Be on the lookout for the streiht up menace, geah
Uh
What's up ya'll
Streiht up menace
Geah
Streiht up menace
Geah
I'm N 2 deep
I had to kill another brother and I just can't sleep
One Time's tryin' to do a smooth - creep
And on top of that
Fools after me for diggin' one of that hoodrats
I ain't got time for the female story
Fools want me got to come to my territory
And ain't no you can get out this
Fools come and they get done on their own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay? Cause I don't wanna punk out
Or what should I do?
My homies say the hood
Where it's good homeboy I thought you knew
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react caught 2 in the chest
Now look who's down I guess I'm finished
I guess I'll die like a streiht up menace, geah
Uh
What's up y'all
Streiht up menace
Geah
Somebody help me out
Cause I'm a streiht up menace
In the house for the 93 shot

We from the West Side
(1-5-9)
All the time
I gots to get mine so I'mma take your
I do what I gotta do, kick in some back doors (geah)
You don't work, you don't eat is the scene
A nigga like myself got to get me some green
I heard a nigga say: I got a little business trick
So smooth your momma won't know your tryin' to make a grip
I said: what's that?
He said: don't worry bout that!
Just grab this muthafuckin' gat and stick it behind your back
Where the fuck was we going I wondered, didn't give a damn
Because the hood took me under
Stick the gat behind my back with an extra clip
My nigga said: E just watch your back and you best not slip!
I said: homie you don't know me
Don't you see saliva drippin' from my mouth? I'm too hungry!
Jump in the bucket, fuck it!
Take a look back at the crib then hit the pedal to put in my bid
We in the bucket, best believe we gon' doing some lootin'
We got straps in our laps, we gon' be doing some shootin'
Headed to the West Side
To start some shit, fired up the blunt
To get my head buzzed to pull the hit
Now I'm ready to cook
Take the strap on my back and I take another look
I'm ready to do some muthafuckin trippin'
I'm ready to hit your mutherfuckin block
With it cocked, catch you slippin, we in the bucket jettin'
Must be nearin the spot because I'm sweatin (ah, damn!)
My nigga peeped and said:
E sit back under the seat as he reached
Pulled out the Mac (yeah it's on)
Hit a couple of corners slow then he killed the lights (geah)
Grabs my strap cause tonight's the fuckin night
I guess this is where the plot thickens
Niggas fix, niggas pluck and fuck like some damn chickens
Fools just best stay hid
Ain't no shame
On the corner like Caine, we might be poppin off some damn kids
Jump out with the strap
Niggas caught off guard
Slipping hard
Running for the damn backyard (run run run)
Somebody got two keys behind a damn door
I look at my nigga and say: what we waiting for?
He said: I'm waiting on you
I said: no shit? Then step aside
And watch this muthafuckin 9 spit
Ready to leave dead bodies on the curb
I'm gon' be sitting on fat - when I get them birds
Not thinking, nobody can do me
Through the back door, I know it's looking like a fuckin' movie (geah)
Big boss man behind the chair and he's scared as fuck
Pop in clip number two and I commence to bust (pop pop pop)
Not giving a damn
Mentality's do or die
Hollow points hit the chair as the feather fly
I hear him scream out loud homey you dirty!
I tell him: shut the fuck up! Where's the birds?
I grabs the suitcase
It's good (that's right)
Unloads my strap like a real G should
Like Santa Claus with a sack full of goods
I'm heading
Back to the hood
I'm back with a Mac
In the front seat of the Benz and I'm flossin'
Niggas get in my way and I'm tossin'
Not from Shaolin but I'm down with the Cream
They sayin' shame on a nigga, know what I mean?
Geah but I'm just that type
The niggas gon' pop you on the late nite hype

No one can stop us cause we quick to catch the fever of the flavor
Punk fool nuthin can save you
You crossed the line boy you slipped
Nuthin' to lose, shootin at your friend as I'm poppin' in another clip
You try to scream but it don't do no good

Too many drive-by's no one can point or pull the trigger
Too many muthafuckin loc'ed ass young niggas
We bail deep and it's an everyday thang, them fifth's
We slang a game of mutherfuckin Compton gang
I gots to peel your fuckin cap, nigga
We come strapped
One more hit on your hood muthafucka ain't no bullshittin'
Better scatter that ass over the fence before the 9 start spittin
And gather up your fuckin kids
1-8-7's for my homies who got stuck with lifetime bids
I'll cap that ass up in the car
When your rollin the streets the gats get blasted by N.O.T.R
Don't try to hang with the fire power it's a slaughter
We bust caps on your awake at the funeral parlour
You get the short end of the stick
Rollin with a click and the way we role, muthafucka it's thick
And my brain is sayin' kill so nigga you're stuck
I like the sound of the 'K when it start to buck
Ain't no damn playin', ain't no rhyme sayin'
One more point for the hood when my gat start sprayin'
We gots to peel your fuckin cap, geah
We come strapped
Night time hits the fuckin streets
Loadin up the clips and we ready to kill rollin the gangsta beats
One time try to run a make on my plates
Routine jack but jack is too fuckin late
Put the strap up in my lap
Hopin these muthafuckas don't trip, Slip pass me the extra clip
I hit the mutherfuckin volume up on the dash
So no tittle-tattle can hear the muthafuckin blast
I give him one to the dome
As the cop start to drop I'm sayin to myself damn it's on
I guess the blunt made me do it
Knew the other times would be comin so I grabbed the strap and threw it
Hit the corner fast, hit the fuckin gas
Be on the lookout cause they coming to tap my ass
We gots to peel they fuckin cap
That's the way we get'em muthafucka cause you know

Damn the hood is kinda hot (say why)
Just heard one of the fuckin homies got shot (shit)
And we don't need it cause it's some shit that we just went through
At Martin Luther King guess who we ran into
The enemy, no friend of me, homies grab your straps (what's up?)
In the waiting room it's time to peel some fuckin caps
And ain't no losin cause we already lost
The homie from the hood so they asses get tossed
And ain't no cowards from my camp, so homie let's dump
Fill they ass full of holes right after we stomp
That's the way it happens, the way I'm sayin'
Fool, niggas from the old school ain't playin (geah)

Crooked hoes, keepin' hid from one...
Check me out
Somebody help me out the ghetto
Cause there's some things I just
Can't let go, uh
My mind takes a twirl
Lord, I try to cope with it
But I scream: fucks the world!
Young nigga with dreams of schemes
For the cash but then awaken
To the sounds of late nite gun blasts (boo-yaa!)
My moms told my ass: hit the floor!
Before the hot ones echo through the window
Damn, what the fuck it's - my block
Graffiti lookin' greedy and niggas who slangin' rock
Fo' sho'
I wanna be like that, fuck Mike
Unless Mike
Was on the corner with a strap at night
Gettin harrassed
By the cops cause he's tryin' to make some dough
So he can push up from a Caddy and dumps the Pinto
So everybody in the hood can cops the llello
And I can collects the - cash flow
Life ain't nuthin' but money and hot 9's
Crooked ho's, keepin' hid from One-Time
You got your strap uh, I got mine
Takin' you back to the time of '89
Pops sendin money in lines
From out of state, but too late
I'm on the corner now way past eight
Better they be on the look out
For dark head lights
Or get caught up
In a twist of a long kiss goodnight
Love the days of gettin paid
With the cavi I cluck
When I roam the hard knocks
Are the court down block
Turnin' tide
Now you bitch niggas - wanna trip
With a year-old Cutlass
And a bag full of grips
Still dips the hood, stay true
Is what they tell me, fuck you bitch-ass niggas
Know the nina never fail me
Lord, forgive me cause sometimes I can't deal
With the pressures from the hood
Where the mentality to kill
Protects me and my kids next, that's real
Jealous-ass bitches cause y'all gots no skrill
Time will reveal
I be damned if I
Let y'all niggas stop my next meal
Chorus...
Now I sits in late nite spots and cluck chips
With a bag of chips eatin loaded up extra clips
Watch out for the knock at the do'
Throw your money through the mail and pick up the damn blow
Quickly now, don't let the po-po show
Or I'm hitted
To the spot where the moon don't blow
Life's a bitch (uh)
Life's not a dance
Life's too short for my ass to try to chance
Last place niggas get caught with the fuckin dollars
Have your ass on G.R. while I dip Impalas
Blue-collar niggas sellin to white-collar fools
But I don't givin a fuck, y'all know cash rules
Pay your dues, stay true
To the street
Get your money, man
Fo' sho' packs my heat
Told by the G's that talk is cheap
But y'all know since the days I'm in too deep

Mind state kinda swerve for the dollar bill
Fuck it to hit me off with a refill
Now it's all necessary you buried an adversary
Could it all be real? Man roll up some mary
Geah let me focus
Money talks so some of you fools hopeless
Geah maybe the reason that it broke us
Geah you gotta take notice
 struggle in the fight make death alright
If you hustle to keep it true

They say money make the muthafuckin' world go
In the hood couple niggas goin' loco
On the Vegas run hoes tryna sell twat
Rap fiends sellin' tapes like a dope spot
They want yo spot
I'm thinkin' fuck not
I got that OG roll em up 
But the recognition muthafucka mean everything
Hate and bullshit drama, what the dollar bring
So it's now blind a muthafucka with the radio
Couple pop bottle  pay a hoe
Niggas lost they weight, what happened to y'all?
We in struggle everyday behind the wall

All day, since 1989 homie

It's Mr. X to the muthafuckin' Z, MC Eiht, yeah
My nigga

But never the less
You got the best

Whether you like it or not you gotta medicate
Pick your poison
My life is sick it'll make you nauseous
How my glass house light up the strip, I'm flawless
Came a long way from crawling
Bitch we ballin'
And my drive is derived from the city we live in
In the struggle we come through
That should never be written or ever put on a record
Niggas feelin' entitled but never puttin' the effort
Left hand on the bible, the other one on my weapon
Now american express is our only expression
And our only direction, tryna have these possessions
I'm a concrete investment in this time of recession
Bloomberg with the business
So the flow progressive
That insurance for my life is that Smith & Wesson
Never approach my section
We the stand up silver back alpha males
You a high prized hooker with ya ass for sell

But never the less
You got the best
But never the less
You got the best
But never the less
You got the best

Blue stamp get em'
Year round get em'

Whether you like it or not
You gotta, blame it on the fuckin' alcohol
Niggas is with the business we ain't runnin' from y'all
Imma 4-five light up the club with shots
G'eah, music to drive by, shut down some spots
And my pride do or die for the city I claim
Never speak it in vein, Compton and 
No snitches included, neighborhood recruited
Me and my bitch ride on decks, you shoot it
Hard liquor i swallow, so i'm still in the mix
You ain't promised tomorrow, so whatever you fix
Break bread for protection, neighborhood infection
Bullets, no name, any nigga direction
1-time's run the front line, they gon' shoot
While i'm tryna have me a sip, damn pickup some loot
Nowadays muthafuckas think life is easy
You don't know who I know, muthafuckas is greedy

You got the best

So here we go

There's a thin line between a dollar and a hand which just connected
With that hand belonged to you then you'd be the one that's most suspected
So to deal with this here, I needs all of mine
Cause stacking G's and smoking trees is really all that's on my mind
And I'm trying to find me a chicken with thick legs and smooth skin
With a cool panty line and lots of paper to spend
Cause where me and Eiht about to go
I know there's chickens for days
You best to bring your Ben Franklins
But never will we pay to play
It's more the other way around cause nowadays that's how it goes
So grab the rest of your girls and let me put a lock on this door
We gon' to be doin this all night or release till we run outta smoke
But see that shit will never happen so just prepare to get stroked
Cause the way we like to do don't get no better than this
Mission one is now done, hop in the Beamer with Slip
So while the players are still hating, trying to ruin the game
You'll see Eiht and Hight T travelling plane to plane

In and out, back and forth just to stack my chips

Nobody knows my name, who's in the limos?
Tinted windows, fuck toss in the demos
Wrong one son, heavy weights the rap
And if you can't start with a hundred best beware for the cap
Keep it moving and guns keep tucked up in the coat
Judge Dredd and the feds on my back when I float
Gots my little senorita on my way to the shop
I'm on my way back to the West to plea no contest
False arrest
But y'all know how O.J. did it (geah)
Cost about 2 million get me straight acquitted

Keeps a smile on my face, you in a ?powder? of red
Best bring my cash and don't be late
My senorita with your product get it straight upstate
Locked down
Got a gang of stories for my celly
Return trips with chips strapped to her belly
Meet her at the telly, collect my fee
While your counting from the pen, I'll hit y'all up at 3

Ain't no escaping cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin'
And on top of that got moms sprung
Scheming of the top
Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone & that ain't no good
Gotta follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas putting brew
In my fuckin baby bottle, damn
And through all the mothafuckin' pain
They done drove my Mom's insane
So I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I'll grow up to be a streiht up menace, geah
Uh
C'mon yall
Streiht up menace
Now I'm of age
And living in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm finally fresh outta High School
Never did I wonder
That the mothafuckin hood would take me under
Geah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store owned by the fuckin
See a bitch in the right lane so I comes with a mack
Astro van, pulls a mothafuckin jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homies head
See I'm playin the shit cool and don't be a fool
He shot my nigga in the fuckin head
I caught one in the shoulder if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm laying in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk mothafuckas and my eyes is bloodshot red
Geah, mothafuckasI ain't finished
Be on the lookout for the streiht up menace, geah
Uh
What's up ya'll
Streiht up menace
Damn
Really
Really
Streiht up menace
Damn
I'm in too deep
I done killed the mothafucka and I just can't sleep
One Time's tryin' to do a smooth - creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin one of they hoodrats
I ain't got time for the fuckin bitches story
Niggas want me got to come to my territory
And ain't no you can get out this
Niggas come and they get done on their own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay? Cause I don't wanna punk out
Or what should I do?
The homies say the hood
Where it's good homeboy I thought you knew
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react caught 2 in the chest
Now look who's down I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, geah
Uh
C'mon yall
Streiht up menace
Damn
And on that note
I guess we out of here
Peace to my niggas on the run
And we ain't nothin but streiht up menaces
Damn
Just like I said before y'all it ain't nothin but a Compton thing

The hammer's backjacked, cocked on the Glock
Westward bound, stay down
To the fools that's gon' bow
How you like us now?
Steady living by the trigger
I toss on nigga
Nuthin' on my ass but Tommy Hilfiger
Droppin' chronic by the pound
Who's teachin' classes?
Bitches blowin all day with their naked-asses
Checks my spot, better yet, checks my knot
Jack to Jill, round the hill, I get the scrill'
Better pay me
I need the money, so I'm goin' crazy
Can I still kill it? You bet!
Words float from the tongue to get your panties wet
So hop yo' ass in the back seat, let's roof
And stick your big ass out the sunroof

As we tips through your town straight puttin' it down
We them killin' muthafuckas with no regrets

I puts it down 'funky enough' like The D.O.C
Maybe you can't see, blind like Stevie
That's sick, you blind and you just can't see
You need to wear sun-glasses like D.M.C
Cruise around in S.5. classes
Sippin' on D.P. in tall glasses
Bullet proof vest protects the chest, cause it ain't wettin'
Call me Big Daddy Kane, ain't no half steppin'
'Who's got the props? Who's got the props?'
The Hubtouchablez is in the house, it don't stop
Get moves for that ass
Come smooth on that ass
But the girls be shaking that ass for the cash
Got 'em hangin' loosely
Just introduced me
Now you tryin to juice me
Damn baby, I know ho's got their heat
But back the fuck up and gimme 80 feet

""Take a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back""
Play a game of knick knack patty wack
Toss my sack out and watch it come right back
Fatten the pockets cause we got to have it on the daily

West Side, East Side when we hit the floor
Got the paper for sure, got chronic galore
And the ho's keep beggin us to blow some more

Money makes the world stay up (that's right)
Fiends to hook us up on the late night hype
G's flips on the corner while we chill in the club
Short skirts put in work, straight show you love
You know the title
Heavy weight nigga with the green, everybody know the spot
One times ain't hot
Gots the bomb
Everybody tell your friends
C-P-T and the L-B back again
Bring your heat
Eiht and Daz with the paper
One time won't be gafflin for the caper
Can't see me
Two black niggas from the West
Decide where they hoo-ride, two of the best
No contest
C-P-T so get it straight
Y'all don't know the program, switches on my Brougham
Skates to the L-B, three wheel motion
C-P-T chill with G's right next to the ocean


We too rough, we too tough
And the niggas that I hang with is just too much
And we'll fuck you up
When we acting up
Dat Nigga Daz and Eiht straight fucking shit up
Swervin down the block as my system knock
Niggas take what you got, get trip, you get shot
Come through like we usually do for you and who
Draped in blue
Nuthin but riders in my crew
Throwing it up
Mad dog, all in my cup
Smokin blunt after blunt ready to fuck shit up
Nigga what?
How you want it, ain't no survivors, just goners
It's gettin hectic when the 9 start spittin
Burn around and lay every rapper down in your town
Wash 'em up just like the verdict come down
We'll take your shit
Your bitch and your grip
And this is how it is when we take your shit


Hit and run
Just for fun
But it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Stop fakin', baby, cause we got paper to spend
More peso's, guaranteed to clock those
Suppose I be's the nigga with static
Watch my back, always packs the automatic
East coast, West coast fuck that, you dig?
Niggas in your own hood'll split your wig
But me, I'm on the premium
Never on the regular
Connects in bound, trips on my cellular
I'm telling ya
It must be the good life, son
Land of the sunshine, Crystal wine
Keeps one time thinking, suspicious
Twenty-six S-5 hun', twenty inches
Must be the money from the rob, they don't know
Must be the money from the gang, fo' sho'


Who's your friend or not?
Your old partners from the block
Take and pop shots
Trying to put my life to a stop
Prepare for the murder spree
Bustin' until I'm free of these bastards
Never heard of me and never knew of me
Supposed to love me, homie, show me
Through all the shit that we been through homie, you owe me
Make you pay fo' sho', it is rough
Off brand niggas getting rushed
On the boulevard, times is really getting rough
Call your bluff, why you wanna always front
To be a all day nigga it's a all day stunt
I'm from the East side of Long Beach, and we roll deep
Creep and blow your whole head off, you're caught in the street

C'mon, geah
Hey...
Once upon a time in the ghetto you're stuck
In the ghetto you're fucked
Ah - press your luck
I said once upon a time in the ghetto
You're through
Once upon a time in the ghetto
It's like you
Check it out
(Verse 1)
My life has been like gun blast every night
Stop the car, searched down with a flashlight
""Where's the gun? Where's the dope?""
The drive-by last week they try to pin, there's no hope
Wishin' I wasn't the victim, better yet the suspect
Waitin to run a warrant check
""What set you from? What side of town?
Nigga like you must be ready to get down""
Hold up now, cause I start to speak my mind
I question the place of the ride and what time
""Speak your mind one more time, you're through""
They found a bullet that I stashed in my shoe
Fuck, now they gon' tear up the car
Try to lock me in a cell that's as tight as a jar
But that's the way it's goin' down, the gang story's told
Tomorrow might be the same episode
Chorus...
Once upon a time n' the ghetto you're through
Once upon a time n' the ghetto I'm like you
Once upon a time n' the ghetto you're stuck
In the ghetto you're fucked
Ah - press your luck
I said...
(Verse 2)
Y'all can follow me, see how gangstas walk
Real killas spit the strap and don't talk
Set trip, murder at night, we stalk
Yellow tape, bodies outlined in the chalk
I keeps my enemies close
Last night seen a life straight turn to ghost
My position is to roll through round-the-clock
Keeps watch on the one times down the block
You hear the click with the bang-bang, then you stop
Try to run, but the chest burn makes you drop
My comrads and criminals through hard time
I ride for y'all niggas, pop goes my nine
I do the crime, the point is mine
Look around the clockwork, it ain't hard to find
Any block, ward or burrough, you know what I speak
Your clients all cross the street if yo' product is weak
Chorus...
(Verse 3)
Y'all fools come up short on the work and try to cheat us
Cold niggas, cold-ass world, catch the heaters
Burn you bitch-ass niggas, you can't beat us
Another life lost, you never will defeat us
Gun smoke's the outcome I predict
Locked down, never that, nickel slick
Try to cheat a nigga for dollars, ""holla holla""
Is the sound that you make for cuttin' off the cake
Fake niggas, I hate yo' face, niggas
Seal your fate, no safety on the triggers
Ditches for the bodies I dump I dig bigger
Puttin mo' dick to ya than Dirk Diggler
Static cling, bust straps, you ears ring
Funeral day, the sad songs to sing
Nigga shoulda known by now it's mines
Step now or charriots will swing

Hoo-Bangin' one time, check it out
Hoo-Bangin' two times, check it out

And if you're bailin thru Compton
You better bring a gun
Cops tryin to set off spots and raid niggas
Just cause we some fuckin paid niggas
Zags and crack that I used to sell
To the swap meet to get my gear and straight bail
What 'll it be to they lost my loot
So 5-O wants all a blue khaki suit
Shoot if ya'll come down the block, static
Dash like a rabbit barely escapin the automatic
Tragic is the scene that's left
Bringin the pain like Meth(od Man)
The yellow tape means death (boyaa)
Steps the fuck off or meet your maker
The Tech 9 will take ya be the back-breaker

And make cash and pick of enemies
Tryin to trespass , for sho'

Provoke any nigga that try to step
Fools trip I'mma show 'em

Witnesses clap twice out the door
Slow with the creep while the neighbour's asleep
Still music to drive-by and I'm N2 deep

Young niggas strugglin best get your money
Creep up in the late night
Keep your grip tight lay low outta site

I tell you it's hell up in Compton, know what I mean
Niggas'll keep you dumpin plottin for cream
On a late night tip straight chasin your dream
Just a young knucklehead tryin to run with the team
Moms and Pops tripped and slipped into the split
Now the days got tight cause this nigga wasn't gettin shit
The old fools down the block said: you're dumb
If you sling that white they will come
Now I know the game 50 double into the C- note
The beach cruiser flipped into the el camino
My hoodrat bitch done got a little class
Swap meet jewelry to tight jeans with ass
The .380 tucked away in a stash
The old school tapes I pumps in the dash
Just so I can smash
Sometimes I wonder how the hood life could last

The hood still took me under ( somebody help me out )
That's true
The hood still got me nigga
Like you
Gettin money on the blocks with my crew ( I don't wanna be here )
I'll be a thug nigga till my days is through

Like you
Gettin money on the blocks with my crew ( I don't wanna be here )
I'll be a thug nigga till my days is trough

One-Times is gafflin that's the story
Another drive-by, another territory
Seems that they got a nigga all shook up
Y'all know we run the fuckin streets if we all hook up
But fuck it back to the fat packs I cook up
Your clientel down the block I straight took up
Dead presidents I got to stack it (ching-ching)
Infiltrators can't see the  in my jacket
Lord you gotta forgive me for bein a thug
Niggas cross the frontline, catch the slug
Bullet cracks the window, body hits the rug
Burn rubber-sound means a nigga just dug
Out the crime scene back to my section
Slippin in the dark, shoulda had protection
That's how it goes never take shit lightly
Hoo Bangin gangstas thinkin just like me

Eiht bucked a nigga down to the ground
And everybody heard about the Compton sound
Criminals to drug - dealers grouped with skan'less hoes
To the baby kids making the hood grow
Can you feel me? Gotta make my pay!
To the niggas that wanna kill me: I don't play!
Walk this way, no foul play I'm N 2 deep
One times make a nigga wanna play for keeps
Sometimes makes me wanna holler
How your homies from the same game wanna tame you for your dollar?
Nuthin' to lose, I choose to get a rep
Step, yep nigga, Compton 4 death, hit me

A little diamond
Keep the pussy for a little while and

Here goes another gang tale from that street smart cat
First lesson: don't be slippin' without your gat
Cause out here they be trippin' on all kinds of shit
From the colors to the way that you hit your switch
Don't be a soft-ass nigga
Just belong to the gang of your choice with your hand on your trigga
Now represent like you got no fuckin' sense at all
On every corner that is clear, hit your name on the wall (geah - hey)
Jump in the back seat, we on a hoo-ride
Reminiscin' about my muthafuckin homies that died
I lay back and close my eyes and wonder
How many muthafuckin' niggas the hood gon' take under (geah)
But it's a fact; that these niggas be slippin'
Gon' get caught up with the muthafuckin Mac
But it's all good, doing dirt, puttin' in work
I got love 4 tha hood
Come on
Uh, geah, geah, c'mon
We got love for our hood

Do you got love 4 your hood? Geah c'mon
(Throw your shit in the air like you just don't care)
Can't wait to hit the gate at 3 p.m
A 159 killers I'm ready to kick it with them
Let my rag hang slightly out the button hole
I'm ready to stack chips higher than a totem pole
Geah, I hopes this gang shit don't ever cease
Duckin' and dodgin' from the school police
To the west, we got power, one time's scary
Hoodrats by the dozen, everybody's cousin
Caviar selling's how we handle our biz
Drive-by shooting's just the way that it is
Cavi in the bushes, straps in a stash
Liquor store run, somebody better make a dash
Living that life on the edge ain't nuthin (uh get'em)
You best not wanna be startin' something
But geah, it's all good, doin dirt, puttin' in work
I got love for the hood, come on
Geah (hey)

You got love for your love?

Hittin' you - up like a pager you gets played like Sega
Only real G's come from the West

Who Runn The Blocc,UnKnown,2012.0,"MayLAy shoot the shit since the youth at risk
The big homies knew what crew to pick, who was with the missions for the hittin'
Someone's breakin' and enterin', others takin', deliverin', the caterin', the kitchen men
The difference then, blacks owned hella houses
If you was snitchin', wasn't livin' to tell about it
If you was right, we'd fight all day and night
But doing wrong, you on your own for life
I'm from Los Angeles, big guns, women, and cannabis
Niggas can't run from where the cameras is
Cause when the bird hit the light, it turn midnight bright
Another term for the chips, with the flicks and the kites
We like lowriders, and hogg motorcycles
And we’ll go psycho, with rifles like white folks
Tell em' Eiht, its West Coast, till my eyes closed
With one shot, plus a blindfold

Who runn the bloccs?

One time, swoop up on the blocc tryna take mine
I hop some fences
Now it's a footchase, tryna dash for freedom
It's money over everything, we don't see ‘em
Fuck the census, since I was a lad
It was hood took me under, motherfucker I'm bad
Sad day, the homie got jacked
And shot in the process, geah that's wack
I get em' on everything, we get back
Necessary be the time, geah when shit crack
Community resources the source be
My income streak, and they come so regularly
The enemy come, so ya better be ready G
So, when I aim, better hold it steadily
Shit, call it the warzone, life in the land
Where it's follow the rules or they reprimand
I rep for the west, so the Eiht can handle
Compton for the hood's what the fuck I stand for

And a colt 45 like Pac got Juice
Still a nigga struggle, so the yay produce
It's all for the money, so a nigga could lose
Cuz, it was Nissan trucks
And the ugly rat bitch, back then, was a duck
I told the hoe bitch, get the duck sick
Round up the baby gangsters, hit a lick
One shot, now its life up state
The homie from the hood turned up my cell mate
Love for the hood
Hater motherfucker gave a nigga all day, but I stay all good
I hit the streets, right back in
One time's on my coattails, niggas can't win
That's the motto, hustle hood rich

We gon' break it down for ya'll
Lil' lesson for ya'll
Check it out
(Verse 1)
Niggas recognize the game that I spit
Tales from tha street on some gangsta shit
Ms. phat bootie bitches with money to get
We git the money and leave the pussy wet
It's a very thin line between bangin and robbin
Big difference from small change to big-timin
I've been down for 12 years, still spittin my flow
Still in the CPT, still fuckin a ho
Still mentality ""kill at will""
Still C.M.W., nigga Eiht and Chill
Fuck around and get your cap peeled, that's low
Then back to the hood while the pistol smoke
I ain't no joke, ya'll best remember
I keeps heat nigga all through December
If your body still cold then you must be dead
You shoulda listen to the words I said
(chorus)
Rule #1 -hey- get money
Get a ride with switches, fuck a gang of bitches
Rule #1 -hey- don't get caught
If the One-Time swoop then it's all your fault
Rule #1, watch your enemies, friend
Cause they'll be the ones fuckin you in the end
Rule #1, that's just what we go thru
I'mma break it down, nigga just for you
(Verse 2)
Night time must be the right time
Don't get caught pullin a damn crime
Cause that'll have your ass in some shit
Probably stuck, you can't fuck with it
From the bottom to the top, rag drops with cops
Try to (??) so my car could stop
And girl stash the bud' in your bra'
And don't get nervous, here comes the law
You know the routine, car must be clean
T-shirt and dub cap with some bling-bling
Yes, they saw the black face with a red bone bitch
Must be ghetto bitch, caught me hit in a switch
Damn, I thought we was back in the old days
Seemin that the ones is back to they old ways
Stick and I'mma get stacked, run in them old place
Like in the East Side keeps it John Blaze
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Who's that bangin and creepin while I'mma sleepin
Try to set up this thing and light me up for the weekend
Damn shame, game done did a 360
Hammer girl turned a bitch and done switched like Missy (Elliot)
No progress just a serious test
To become an MC and try to fuck the rest
Have my bill fold, too phat to close
Had a thug nigga shot down all my shows
Industry (??) got me lookin for cheques
In this green leaf hustle on the block with tax
My mission is to get it
Automatic with the automatic
Kick back with no static
In the land of the lost, pay the serious cost
Thug niggas loose they life, ho-bitches get tossed
One-Times claim the boss, handle this scandalous
Try to send niggas to harassin laws

Steps back and kill at will

No game, the shit's real
So I hits the blocks with yay, no fucking deal (that's right)
I'm heated - and I'm greedy as fuck, I need a meal
My dog told me watch out for shit and pack steel
""And if you care - lil' nigga, get a vest (boom boom!)
Cause niggas be hungry like you and they ready to test""
You die, motherfucker, it's the same gang tale
Niggas talk about who did the killing in jail

Smash, the real regulators sowed it up
Push rhymes like weight, push - real weight
Get my money comin' in from state to state (chin chin)

Real thug from the street, yes, die for the cause
Dips the blocks with the heat, right next to my balls
I be the first nigga to jump on the - front line
Slang quarter piece rocks and dodgin - One Time
Everybody hustlin' for cash and that's real
Half of us niggas be looking for any bill
Lock down ?? my ass ??
But I bails out, another head back to coke
I gots to bang the hood, slang - till it drop
The enemies I fear not, fuck a cop
The enemies, they come close but get popped
I lasted, laughed last till your heart stopped

Easily I approach
The nigga who's slippin'

The tense situation

They run real fast
When they see the gunsmoke (hey - boom boom!)

West y'all - at the - funeral hall
Your homies take sips as they reminisce on nuthin'
I come around catchin' you slippin', doing a dumping
One little, two little, three little suckers
Hoo-Bangin' niggas is killers, you muthafucka

So every other day when I hit your damn side
Feel my fuckin' revenge
As I blast through your house with your family and friends (boom boom!)

Just another brick in the wall you fall tired
Who will be the one son to fall victim?
Who's on the street, who's runnin' from pigs wishing?
No way out
You can't stay out - your hook
Criminal lifestyle, you're booked in the crook
Where will you seek shelter? Killafornia
What'll you do when you see the heat around the corner?
You silly fucking goner, where will you hide?
On the sick side of town facin' the long ride

Cause you never know when it's time for some action
A fraction, chain reaction the crew smashin'
Through your city get the committee a ready faction

And muthafuckas are on it
You can't call it, buster you better stall it

We got G-boys and ho's on deck
One times gafflin' niggas that chin check (check it out)
You see a robbery
We done it
That's just the way we run it

Ten years in the game, no chains remain
Heavy weights, get it straight, still bringin' the pain
First green since the B.G
I gotta get cream
Late nite hype's the fiends as I plots a scheme
Got tight with rap flows and followed the rap shows
But the streets keep callin' me to cluck the pesos
Did good
I made up tapes about the hood
Locked down that shit as nobody could
Enemies always out to get me
But just keep spittin' rhymes and they won't hit me
Street dreams always made of this
Top dollar
Bitches and switches is on my list
Leave your ass with the good night kiss
Makes moves smooth so your shorty won't miss
Never runnin' to meal, we chill on the hill
Real G's always packs the steel


It ain't a problem that I can't fix
Cause I can do it - in the mix
Nowadays
We be's the G's that's deadly
Bustin' raps, shootin' craps, gots the straps on ready
Common sense'll tell you, slide out
But ain't no fuckin' where for you to hide out
Got the picture?
We don't play no games
Eiht and B-Real fuckin' Frank & Jesse James

For the last time I told ya how I spit the strap
Love the West and die for this gangsta rap
Cross my name on the wall, cross my path you fall
Consider the times that the hoes tried to break my balls
Tryin' to stack a mil-ticket, snatch hoes to kick it
Anything y'all drinkin', ya hoes get picked it
In the middle of the floor grab the dick and lick it
The life of a hood superstar is wicked
Point blank get the cash if it's the cash to get
Don't get your chest wet and get outta this shit
Touch down with the brand new sack
Niggas will take over when they turn pitch black
Stay packed on my dogs Locs
And bitches on the lookout for fiends One-Times ??? little that geah
We get the money, all day everyday
Fly bitches that get down, ain't shit funny nigga all day everyday
Gangstas lean, know what I mean

Yeah nigga Eiht back in the game
Runnin' you suckers crazy

A few homies on the road to perdition
Your hands in the air with your mouth shut
G shit in the buildin' bitches go nuts
 scenario Gs and gents
G niggas had their money well spent
Hoes bend over, show what you got
Slap your own ass, girl you're too hot
I break it down fast 
Undercover so the Os don't spot
I'm tryna push it in the fast lane
Couple flips, tryna tighten up my cash game
Same thing different day
A couple hits on the blunt it's okay

Put it down for the hood so it's really don't sweat
Niggas thick tryna push through the door

And we ain't fuckin' with the 
Sneek 'em in the club just in case we gotta gat clowns
So hot start a fire on the roof
Niggas chest out feel real bulletproof, geah
Don't let your ego trip man
Then your girlfriend pop by the waistband

Rude awakening, hearts gettin' broke

Niggas got cheese when the rats come bite
Pass the light, we LOC'd after dark
Them niggas come out, the shootings gon' start
We at the good part, been payin' our dues
We came from the streets so it's nothin' to lose
All hip-hop news report the week
Some fools release when they should not speak
Niggas want beef never turn the other cheek
One shot make your brain cells leak
Get a sneak peak niggas pull 
OG from the hood niggas walk this way

Is you with me?
Cause these niggas...
I was raised on the fucked up side of town
Moms used to make me wear hand-me-downs
Pops wasn't around, nigga pulled a skip to my loot
In the midst of the shit what the fuck to do?
No Mercedes Benz (that's right)
Moms used to cluck a lotta fuckin ends (that's right)
But a young nigga needs the green in this day and age
Phones my seven man crew, grabs the 12 gauge
But now fools tryin to trip
My little homie named Sis say you best not slip (watch out)
I hear some fools say you got too much shit
I look at them niggas and say you don't know who you fucking with
Just watch your back for them skan'less pack of niggas
On me and my seven man crew, they wanna pull the trigger
But we on a quest for niggas that's dealin (that's right)
Son, it's either drugs or killin, c'mon
Is you with me? Is you with me?
Cause these niggas straight killin for life
Geah
Damn they done got my nigga (shit)
But before he killed off he told me who pulled the trigger
(geah, right)
Lying in my arms dying, what is this?
And I'm thinkin' I gots to handle my business
Gots to get my hands on my gat
But my G's say: nigga please we'll handle that! (we got that!)
As they procede to put the hit down
I hooks up with this big boss across town (ping)
He pullin' all kinds of schemes to get the green like robbin trains
But now me flips all them snips to gets to stacking caine
Sets up shot on your block to clock ends (that's right)
And I heard your big homey went straight to the pen
I heard One Time done found his straps
Snatch one of my little locos for the murder rap (check it out)
We gon' get you out cause ain't no stoppin
Something just got to be poppin from all this drugs and killin
Is you with me? Is you with me?

Business is boomin and the birds still flying south
I guess it's time to get my muthafuckin homie out
Moms is tryin to tell me to quit
And my girl is gettin pissed cause she's tired of the shit
I got fools at my back door tryin to buck
But I'm that killin-ass nigga who don't give a fuck
Now my long time rival is tryin to break me down
Done kidnapped my man, goddamn
He said he want the keys
But that punk-ass nigga can't get none of these (pop pop pop)
To get my homie back I bust his cap
And now my homie in the pen is back on the map (geah)
My crew's back on swoll and we chillin
We rolls around and we get top billin

Cause its a cold cruel world with some stonecold streets
Which block you set trippin happy
Wrong shit out of their teeth catch the reef
No sorrow cause it might be me dead tomorrow
So ya'll see the hollow its the cold I follow

And the criminal mind make shure the crime pays
Who lays deep in the cut I'm givin a fuck

Drove off in the alley so I can hit they gates
And release the wooden handle 38 with dub take

You can catch me in the land of the greenest snaps
Stanks from tha strip clubs
Homies packin they straps, check it out
One-Time's kinda corrupt, the hood life's crazy
But I love the hood life, baby it's all gravy
Sunday afternoon, the midnight moon
But I'm thinkin that I gotta get to Compton soon
Got a ounce in my pocket and a cupple of grands (chin,chin)
Serve a cupple of hours and hit the burger stand
My hands stay tight on the grip you heard
We gotta duck quick, here come the bird (chipp,chipp)
Back on the block, no dope in sock
Got a house-side window where you're slightly knockin (boom,boom)
Got my tape bumpin Eazy-E and (2)PAC
Check the time on my watch bout 2 o' clock
Call the bitch at the club that I ran into
Holla back, said I come thru and shake it for you

In hot sunny county, dippin with a hood rat

Fuck a bitch, fuck a nigga, it's the gangsta mode
The story has been told by a thousand times
Town of the thug niggas, hoes and crimes
Some niggas rap star and try to shine (bling!)
Some stay in the hood and stay on the line
That's fine with you nigga
Gyeah, I got your corner
If enemies trip you can bet they are goner
True kill niggas got 20 and better
Hood's still tight, collect cards and letters
It's still a Compton thang, whoever the pain brang
Whatever the mind frame, we can play this game
Compton for death and dollars all the same
Uh, never a shame, ya'll know the name

Or til the One-Time sweep me under the rug
Or til the Lord takes me away from this place
So I won't see my enemies fate
Chase the dream, cause it's all about the way you kick it
Some hoes won't get down if a nigga wan' lick it

No, 1/2 Oz. is in this
And hey, bitch put your money where your mouth is
Bounce back, cross state, takin the chance
Just to flossin, hook up with the motto and hot dance
Damn, sometimes I wonder, is this all just a bad dream
Or did the hood take me under

159 reasons to bust you with the dirty Glock
It looks like rain, so I'm wettin
Your hood, of course, no remorse, better start jettin
No need for fuckin with the killer when I'm goin down
Nigga please, no R.I.P.'s for these Westside gees

Which I stash by my fuckin dick
Definitely set-trippin, reminiscin
Bout my homies who died from the Park
From Casual to Short
Line up the homie as a teardrop falls
No time for back-trackin, cause hood work calls
Housecalls be given, where you livin, unforgiven
My mentality's like the dead has risen
Hit your block with the Glock cocked, I'm ready to pull it
Not givin a damn, fool, catch the fuckin bullet
Your mama, your daddy, your old annie-granny
Oh no, I'm loco, out the roof of the Caddy
Aw shit, fire spits out the hole of the Mac

Bitch please, 159 gees
Fill your bucket, fuck it, full of holes like Swiss cheese
And ain't no stoppin this b.g. from the C-P-T
Dippin around, fool, that's where I be
Niggas disrespect, makes me chuckle
Represent the hood on my fuckin belt buckle
Chalkin up points, smokin on joints, I roll through
With the mentality of fuckin you
Niggas on niggas, we need to quit
Say it ain't no peace, just this piece on yo ass like flies on shit

That's how we doin it
Regulating for all the gangstas
West Side, nigga, Hoo-Bangin' Gangstas, you know I'm sayin'
Check this out
I said I dig into yo' body, you catch the flatline
Compton, where we from, nigga?
Compton, all day, nigga
We gon' start it like this
Check this out
Way back 4-4's seven years in the pen
.38 with wooden handles and a fifth with gin
Let me begin, before the days of committin sins
I was a lil' knucklehead getting courted in
Till I die C.P.T., y'all can't budge me
Kill a nigga for the neighborhood, can't judge me
I'm lettin' the fire spit, y'all fools catchin' some slugs
I regulate, servin' you way that straight thug
You know if you're slippin' you get laid up in the mud
Take over your spot, pushin' china white and bud
The devious, the mind blowin', the over-throwin
Christmas everyday in the hood, I keep it snowin
It's hot like that where I'm from
You bitches tryin to test, you meet the M-1
From sun up, nigga, to sun down
I pull out, your gat go down
Bitches, I run town, what up?
Geah
I said I dig into yo' body, you catch the flatline...
Y'all start runnin' and screamin' and pushin'
And yellin' and slippin' and duckin'
When you see the Tec-9 buckin'
Stagger them motherfuckers, make em wish they hid
Spittin, call me the ghetto fuckin' Billy the Kid
You be layin on your back tryin' to catch yo' breath
Life starts to flash, now you're nearing death
What's left, bitch? You see the Glock starts tickin'
Die, as I blast one more you stop kickin'
Flee the scene to my next to akin
Call back to the house, so they fly in ends
Just made a real close trip to the pen
And in another town I start the same trend
I sets up shot cuz your ass is done
Hoo-Bang all day, my uzi weighs a ton
Ain't no fun if you don't want none
Ricochet off your shoulder blade, nigga, you're numb
C'mon, geah
Chorus...
My mind got me caught in a twist, I can't cope
I reminisce on the days in the hood slangin' dope
Certain territories yo' ass couldn't float
And if you caught slippin', then fool, that's all she wrote
I like the life while dippin' blocks with heats
I'm ready in a second to stop yo' heartbeat
Fuckin' around in the hood, smokin' with hoes
Violators hit the blocks, we hittin' the floors
Y'all ain't caught us slippin', only wasted your ammo
We dips back through, dumps with the 4-4
Hollows come out the dark chamber
Express my anger, never run from danger
Servin mo' yayo, dash from the ranger
Die by the hand of the unknown stranger
My position is stick, situation is thick
I ride with real muthafuckas and hit licks
The Compton lunatic, way too sick
Conflict you pick, hear the 9 click, c'mon

Streets Don’t Love U,Veterans Day,2004.0,"Geah, It's 187 cause I'm back on the block
Quick to shoot first wit the gat that stay cocked
It's real gangsta shit nigga, It's on lock
West coast compton, The town that rock
Follow the cracked up roll down the compton block
Not school, But I'm the motherfuckin neighborhood jock
Whether in tv rock or  ya in
But the team colors sported boy. Blue or flame?
My name not household, I ain't pac
But on the underground fool, Yeah I'm on top
I don't play for the mainstream, Fuck around, Have you playin wit the red beam
Fuck around, few shots leave ya gang green
Slumped over, front seat wit a cold lean
Fa sho, I be first in line to start static wit y'all
Have ya mama at the pad awaiting the call
West coast, West side, East side, We slide
Anywhere y'all want it, Nowhere to hide
Geah

Creep wit the sleeper, Wit the locust look up on my face
You six feet deeper, And you can't wake, Rain drop's fallin
These street's don't love you, But they can love you
They follow me though

Beef ain't a dvd, It's automatic
I'm gone off the hood life, So call me an addict
In the land where girls got plastic tits
Niggas wit plastic grips ready to start shit
Who the fuck y'all wit? Man, where y'all from?
Hollows quickly follow the philly stomp
How come y'all tryin to play the thug act?
Just the way that a copycat gon react
And the impact when the chambers slide back
In-Depth description of the carjack
And you know that tattoo when the arm's raised
The shots penetrate you and they don't graze
I just blaze, Just like school days
I run wit a frat of boys, We so crazed
Creepin, So amazing, We a little iraq when we start engaging
Any nigga I smack, My machine is raging
Gun tucked when I gotta fuckin rhyme on stage, Man


Been under the hood spell for so damn long
My life in the streets just can't be wrong
I'm hardcore, Motherfucker, 
bitch ate my scrote
I'm old school like a pimp, Likely to trip
No chip on ya shoulder, I knock it off
Every motherfuckin rhyme you rock is soft
Burn, Weak niggas, burn
Wannabe o.g., But you can't earn
Wanna see us flee, But you gon learn
Just wait, Sky free, See the wheels turn
Hustlas, Ridahs, Hoes, Ex-cons, Grown westside boys like lil jon
I'mma bang compton til the break of dawn
Late night hype, Mean bodies dead on the lawn
 sure ain't strong
But I'll jack for ya jewels and head straight to the pawn

Sendin niggas' bodies to hell like sadam
Appetite for destruction corruption
To the highest degree my gat steady dumpin
Always into something you heard of me
Killer for reala my nigga another tragedy
Pops in the clip and slips the automatic
Anybody killer I gat it stay tatted
Fucks them high class I like em hoodratted
When the shells slide they panic
Nigga straight static
Catastrophe caught in monopoly you copy
Defy you mock me you're gettin sloppy
I rolls through goes through such and such
The angel of death meets you time to touch
Mind of a lunatic quick to handle
Sackin muthafuckas like I was john randall
I blows out your spot like a candle
I fucks you up muthafucka like I was rambo

Easy as it comes I can handle the drama
I bucks givin a fuck and high off marihuana
Sendin your body through some muthafuckin trauma
I can dump the damn body you can scream for mama
Common sense you make your ass hit the fence
Run fast or catch the consequence
My straight aim I got it with confidence
The sticky situation I make it intense
The instigator the muthafuckin regulator
The quick to dump the shells in the ass of a infiltrator
The violator the muthafucka with heat
Let me see if you can beat it from across the street
I'mma knock your damn noodles cos your talk is cheap
I'm a rockabye nigga cos your ass asleep
I'mma show you the way let these real G's play
Stick and move with the working clock like sugar ray

Y'all know what the song and dance is get the flows up
Y'all know when the fuckin cash drawer your hands goes up
Close up shop nigga the hood's in town
Hand over the money and don't make a sound
Doomsday no parlay no politickin
We packs up with extra clips and steady dippin
Niggas in black coats with black nines
Dig into your body and catch the flatline
Your mama cry over your body at funeral time
Gang related one-time reported the usual signs
Hot crimes killin who dropped dimes
Smokin chronic reefer listen to gang rhymes
Y'all know the time it's now the pow-wow
The big payback have a nigga lay down
Anyway you bring it I want it
Gun-totin killin muthafucka from compton's most wanted

I'm tryin ta chase dead prez like Larenz Tate
But do it in dog mind-state
It's 187 on whoever don't stop
Throw away the strap right after the pop pop
Then ride shotgun, Pass me the handgun
I still yell out compton, Shoot and run
2 is double the trouble
Double up the work on game gon bubble
Couple of loco's from the westside, Homes
Dope in the coolo, Hand on chromes
One-time, Hoodrats, And beef wit the enemy
Niggas puffin so much, We smoke like a chimney
Little b.g.'s mane, Givin us the scoop
4 deep, Tryin to creep, Lights off in the coupe
We squash that in a jiffey
Creep up and shoot in the car just like 50
Click go empty, And it's back to the block
Cause CPT boys so hard knock
Lock up the work, Sell what it's worth
From the days of way back, The days of my birth
I'm so damn cold
One blunt in my hand, My bitch in a chokehold
The hood taught me lessons that can't be told
Whatever you push out, I'll come back eightfold
Sold out? Never, It's compton forever
No one can do it better
Geah, I doubt that
When the guns come out, Y'all could go flat
Now you could fuck all the chat and get a rat-a-tat-tat
Pat down ya pockets like we did in high school
You represent the hood, Always the first rule
I been all around the globe
Hop doggin for the hub like my name was kobe
Sirens, Flashlights, stroll lights
One-time, They never stop at a gunfight
2 compton motherfuckers

Player haters perpetrate
Standin' too close because we ballin'
No competition
But they wishin' they could dodge 5-0
Lay back in the cut
Get sucked and fucked
By a gang of hoodrat ho's
Thought you knew
The way we bring it to you it's on the real
From the days of wayback packin' my strap
On the West Side of the hill
Always chill with a gang of ho's
Cluck cluck pesos everyday
Be the bomb, show you love
So all the skirts head my way
P-A-I-D, no T-L-C
Hell no, we never beg
Take the dick down your throat
Don't choke and open up them legs

Get my buck on, watch a nigga get the fuck on
While he stabbin'

My nigga just got his duck on
Lovin' it so it must be right can't be wrong
With a pocket full of stones
Rib bones and greenery, that's blown
Home grown, watch your tone
Homeboy you can't be from round here
Westside 'bout it 'bout it, we blowin' chronic all year
No fear
For all the niggas and bitches in short skirts
Don't fuck around, represent the town, nobody gon' get hurt
More work, birds fly with ease, steady cluckin' cheese, you know?
And y'all can't fuck around cause we dodge from 5-0
If you knew
Then I guess its your time to straight go
While you layin' in the ground, I creep around and fuck your ho'

U Know Why,Veterans Day,2004.0,"I ain't stupid yo
Motherfucker ran with the game
See a gang of fumes rose watching the choir sing
Say my nigga, he was good for the hood
Two shots caught him slipping, in his place he stood
We going to stick the script, but this ain't no act
Record Sales are the work, man bring on stacks
Way back in the days when we caught Jags
Couple years after they introduce crack
Bred mac with them hood rats on 1580
They was haters back then, motherfuckers was shady
Bitches were kinda feisty, enemies was sheisty
Wannabe MCs trying to out-rhyme me
Please don't fight my gen no more
Imma kick in the door and squeeze the 44
And y'all quick to float if you're quick enough
Man the shots do burn, so don't act tough

So when the shots get to ranging out
You Know Why
And y'all done stopped all that hanging out
You know why
You ain't real what you sing about
You know why
That's why you biting for the paper route
You know why
Fools be fake and gold plated
You know why
And I don't see how y'all made it
You know why
Why we got to kill them off, Eiht?
You know why
Man these fools got us twisted and it's way too late

I love pot and photos that show your gang folds
I wonder how you look when the casket closes
Compton all day. #1 West City
And when we bang coolest, boy, shit ain't pretty
Niggas do dirt and get soaked with SAs
We even catch you slipping up on your best days
And I love West girls man, they love thugs
And I love hotties snug out of town with drugs
Fuck a police mugshot, shoot up a block
Fuck a neighborhood watch man, sell them a rock
When they knock at the door man, flush it all down
And quickly send it off back out of town
8 seconds to the truck boys, all it takes
Two shots to the side, don't slam your brakes
When the neighborhood get through, all of you wakes
Compton on top through and all it takes


Grown man in the coup, boy, don't play games
Any motherfucker drops when the pistol aims
We don't call out names, fool, we fight in the club
When we blow chronic smoke, it's more than it does
Big ass bitch won't buy ego rough
That heart-piece is filled and crushed and snubbed
Imma shoot one-one and shots kill you softly
The second shot's to back your ass up off me
Fuck around lose your shiny valuables in a scuffle
Fake motherfuckers caught up in the Hollywood shuffle
But they don't muffle the sound all over South Central
Drive-by mentality, shoot out the rims
You ain't got to go to the East to get your G-Unit
West Coast gang unit, vest shoot right through it
You punk motherfuckers d-don't d-don't do it
Compton till I die, boy, thought you knew it",https://genius.com/Mc-eiht-u-know-why-lyrics

Keeps two steps ahead, No traces for feds
Phone taps instead, On the celluar phone
Dumb as fuck cuzz they don't know the number was called

Geah

Like the L.A. Lakers
We tryin' to be a money maker
But that's kinda hard to do amongst a gang of salt-shakers
So how can money can a nation when playa-hation do
Think about it, probably of couple niggas playa hatin' you
Because you got a lil' sommethin, trying to keep shit tight
Not at the bar, gettin drunk, trying to pick a fight
But mad niggas got it backwards like they ass was in the front
Actin' like they smoke rock and now grass up in they blunt
I gots no words for em, just 'fist of fury' like Bruce
I let loose on they ass, then hit the fence like Juice
And don't be a broke nigga fuckin' everybody's bitch
Niggas'll get mad cause they gotta pay for this shit
Just cause you got more game then a next man, don't make it bad
Every real nigga got a hustle to 'em, even your dad
So do what you gotta, but don't cross that line
You get yours, I get mine, and everything'll be fine

Masterplans and schemes, so I can get riches

Fancy cars to condos with ????
Pops out the dream (chin-chin)
Cause it seems the corner just ain't workin
In the cut, down the alley, see the one times lurkin'
Everybody packs a sack skrill's not to large
I hooks up a sweet deal with Chico De Barge
Me's the shit, shippin, price is way to high
I could take my chips by ?the product?, double up, kinda fly
Cops the work but still strap cocked by the side
Asked the bitch that I fuck if she was gon' take the ride
Reply: cool!, what's my take on a china white sack?
A thousand, bitch, to your ass, everyone that come back
She say: cool baby, I'm in, try to regulate this cheese
Kept a smile on my face while she dropped to her knees
Picks up the phone and call Chill ?????
But you's a fuckin' hard line they might ?????

Gettin' paid is the American Dream
All I needs is my strawberriez -n- cream...

Touch down for pounds so I can makes my loot
Look for a long hair, redbone in a Nike suit
Don't look suspicious, leave yo' dough at home
Straight out the airport, hit me on the pay phone
To the ho-tel, mo-tel
Whatever pleases, just get my mail
You knows the business
Extra care with the sacks
16 and done spent, bring 24 bag
Don't let them show change on the pack
Cause if they do, 187 is the fac'
Did you make it, okay ?????
I'm on my way back with your pay
Life is lookin kinda lovely to me
Regulate out the state with the ghetto D

Yo would you kill for me?
Hmmm... yeah
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?
When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right
Just me and my bitch
But you know you love that ass, don't you?
Yeah, no question
No question
Yo, let me ask you another question
What?
You ever fuck around on me?
Why would I do that?
Yo don't lie to me motherfucker
Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a Glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together
Just me and my bitch
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your ass fuckin around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don't don't play with my dick
She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
(uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch

Like yo hood and mine learn the same games
Thug niggas, strapped girls down on planes
If you get caught then don't say no names
I gotta flick from a homie doing ten in the pen
Gotta a little bigger since my lil' nigga went in
Lotta tales 'bout fools gettin' em up and shanked
Whose mouth tight shut? Whose shit that stink?
Gotta lil' message - 'bout the bitch you fucked
A nigga cross town got the hoodrat stuck
Me and Loc jacked that nigga last week fo' ends
I shoot a lil' paper till you up in the pen
Fools still riding - got the spot on lock
We gon' chill right here till you back on the block
Nigga still bailin round here khakis and stars
High as fuck as we throw the hood out the car
We miss the days when you used to get drunk at night
Never bailed on a homie when it's time to fight
One times jacked us the last night, face in the dirt
Tryin' to get info on who shot the store clerk
From yo hood 2 my hood's all the same
Like yo hood and mine learn the same games
Thug niggas, strapped girls down on planes
If you get caught then don't say no names
Somebody help me out the ghetto
Ya know - same story just like before
I don't wanna be here just like you
I slangs just 'bout everything to start new
Do you have the answer?
Niggas gettin' popped - dying off just like cancer
You got your enemies, you got your old G's
In the penitentiaries just want to be free
If I had another chance would I do it again?
Rewind the time and head right back to the pen
Seems like I can't escaped this world of sin
Judgement for this young thug in the end
Time's up - this thug caught a slug
In another town trying to slang drugs
My moms pray for my soul
As I lay below
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

Who wanna ride with me and make some money-money?
One-times is hot on my trails, ain't shit funny
My mind state: we can get the cash
Kick in the back door, some punk ass and smash
You wit' me? you can have paper to floss
You can ride around the town, play the big boss
Lil' niggas dying to be on yo' team
Everybody looking your way, you got cream
No f**king tattle tales, trips to jail
Have a all-around trip like back with mail
Hell, it feels good still, dips the hood
Compton, long beach, watts and inglewood
Hoes, holler back if you like the mack
Of the west walkin' nigga who ready for contact
You slide with yo' homie if you love the town
Ruffnecks and fly girls keep holding it down
Geah

All around the hood we go

You wanna take a trip? then come visit california
And roll with me through the hood on daytonas
I take you to my kick-it spots
Where all the homies got they Glock cocked ready to pop
That's how we do it over here, what's happ'nin?
We drink beers, smoke guns and play mackin'
Well, it's the same old bullshit in every ghetto
But niggas in my hood don't listen to heavy metal
Just that real deal hard knock life shit
Only smoke the greenery, never that white shit
Who said my nigga binky mack ain't got tracks? (who? )
Who said compton's most wanted don't pack straps? (who? )
Me and eiht 'bout to show you fools where is at
Talkin smack to your bitches behind our backs
But life goes on in the neighborhood
It's all bad, ain't a damn thang all good

Lifestyles of a ghetto star in a ghetto car
Ghetto nigga for life, always up to par
Meet me at the spot if y'all smokin'
Party at the hood house, no jockin'

Still got the co - nnections which direction
Fly birds straight through your intersection
Reflections of the way life used to be
Where me amigos gave lots of love on the kilos
Servin' the G way

Too difficult to get with the West ebonics
No gin and tonic, situations ironic

The funky ass hood mix
So peep game
Let me take you on a muthafuckin' trip wayback
When niggas that used to give their straps on ??? they packed (geah)
Remember pops used to be an alcohol abuser (right)
Remember when you wheeled the world around on your beach cruiser
Remember moms waited on the County Check (geah)
Thirteen, damn, need to pull a lick (that's right)
Seen the bad influences on the block
My homie handed me my first sack of bucks
About the thousand muthafuckas on the street hanging (geah that's right)
Tried to get their slang on definitely they bang on (what up homeboy?)
Puttin' a sweat down a fool at the bus stop
Wave your ass fast 'fore you hit the pop pop pop
Hit the hood up everytime I go
Tight Loc (that's right) O-B-G C-P-T (Compton)
Disrespect the hood we put you down, geah
Old school makes the hood go round, geah

Ain't nuthin' but the homies got slang, uh (geah)
I said peace to the homies got bang, uh (nigga)
It ain't nuthin' but the Compton thang, uh
The hood done took under all kinds
Got their mommas and their daddies
In their Caddies all strapped with 9's
I guess it's back in the 70's caps got peel
Afros ho's ??? bills
And everybody's up on the gank (right)
In the parking lot, shots went out at Soul Train (pop pop pop)
You best believe they gon' playin' how they sayin'
Back to protect like Goldie the Mack
With their leather jackets and their fuckin' ??
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, yeah they got 'em (geah)
And givin' a damn if they spent time in jail
Grabs their 38 and bail from Adam 12
A place where there's about a million crazy (right)
Niggas and they ladies, havin' more babies (oh geah)
Better watch y'all or yo' assess'll be losin
Drive-by's be poured by smokin' robbers and cruisers, geah

Anyway, forget it girl
It's Alright
If you're standing on the corner hustle all night

All I try to do is stack dough
Anywhere that I can get it man, y'all don't know
I've been in this since the beginning man, check my flow
And my words gonna bring drama, boy, it's gonna show
I'm serious
Just like Steady B
Hoping I don't get caught for robbery
It's a motherfucking jungle out here all day
Shots rang out in the place I stay
And that's my word
Trying to stack, cop a bird
Being the motherfucking nigga is the word I heard
I'm on the curve
Feet up, blowing the herb
Do Not Disturb
We moved out, weighted the birds
(Hey)
You don't see no welcome mat
Niggas like bitches might turn to wraps
Play Crip niggas might change the stacks
Never mind the mic status, I'm still strapped with gats
G-yeah!


Anybody get it, boy that means you
Nightmare of Compton is all true
Another nigga dead so what you gonna do?
A small fraction of what we go through
There's murder in the town, trying to put in work
Then watch out, cause jealous fools might go berserk
He see, she see, they scheme a plot
Of being a beer memory, what? Eiht gets shot
Not!
Imma shoot for the dough
And keep squeezing the trigger till my finger's sore
You'll be another victim who fucked with colors he wore
You'll be the first dead nigga on my reality show
Gangsta with no calls
And I could run through the clips with no faults
And sometimes that means life behind bars
Finally dumb lady young hero's stars
You get it?


Street Life got me oh so hooked
Get what I split or get your shit took
Don't look, Imma say fuck the math
And let me finish my task, no questions asked
Niggas still struggling, niggas get mine
At any given time, so I keeps the nine
One time, with the flashlight, trying to shine
Loaded, motherfucker's way out of line
I'm a borderline psycho, I ain't like no
Other motherfucker with an AK Rifle
The bitches say ""You so trifling Eiht!
But I still want you to fuck me, and I can't wait.""
Late Night, the domestic fight

Bitch I need, nuthin but cash and weed
Out of town trips, slips my cash with speed
Don't get it twisted, no Captain
But I'm cappin' and duckin'
While a ho hides me out and I'm steadily fuckin'
Doin your thang
While I teach you how to hop on planes
Get this cream from this fool with the country name
Same day you get back, my bankroll stack
As a matter of fact, you know I like that
Sticky bitches have niggas straight spendin' they dough
Ya know cash runs everything around a ho
Greedy as fuck, a chicken tryin' to scheme on chickens
Greedy as fuck, to pay the bitch, she keep on lickin'
I love the ho
She's out to get my paper fo' sho'
Anytime and place she ready to go
Love scratch
No pigeon in the world could match
Simple as fuck
Hood rats ain't hard to catch

Sneaky cause she wanna just fuck for ends

All of y'all do their fuckin' shit
All your homegirl, bitch, who you fuckin' with
Gossip you spit
Put each other up on game
On which nigga's got chips, routine's the same
Shakin' that ass with the jiggle and twitch
In the club bustin', knowin I'mma want that bitch
You ain't seein a nigga ghetto rich
Ghetto fab, ghetto star
Hop off stage, ???bless thou??
No questions asked, that's the role you play
You hit me up on Monday
Fuck the bitch anyway
It ain't nuthin'
And leave suckas say: the bitch good for somethin
Anywhere, any day, any hour
In front of anybody, in the shower

Hood rats
I'm lovin 'em ho's, I'm lovin 'em ho's
Geah ya know how it goes...
Hood rats...

Watch the peddle pushers and rocks in a ?????
How she cop, bitch flips, trips, no sleepin
Back to the club where she strips on a weekend
You know what I'm speakin' she's out to get yo' bread
???? up, choke up, showin some leg
Get down like you live and get down on a dime
You bring yo' homegirl, that's fine
Who is better?
I got the chedder ready to spend
With a video tape so I can record the date
Fuckin' with Eiht it's all good
Now back that ass up like you know you should
Know the game alive, toss chips
Watch you get down and start movin' the crowd

When All Hell Breaks Loose,Last Man Standing,1997.0,"No camouflage, better get the mirage
Soul Assassins squad straight from the garage

First dream: where's the cream so I can parlay
Ain't no joke - ugh - and no mistakes allowed
Crack packs flips, uh, while I moves the crowd
Po-po be stoppin' the low-lows, fo' sho' those
Hate to see me, too blind like Stevie
Greedy cause I'm needy for ash, gas and cash
Same song like re-runs of fuckin' M.A.S.H
Boom Bam keeps the stash locked, son, you know the real
?Four punks layin in your bumper?, so you're best to jump
Bird thumps the fo' do' S-S, no stress
D.A., no deal, uh, no contest
False arrest like Al Capone and Elliott Ness
You better be protected
My barrel starts ejectin
Reflectin on your past life as you pass through
On your way to your second life, bitch, fuck you

Everybody duck down when all hell breaks loose
All my niggas gon' shoot when all hell breaks loose

Shoot 'em up, oh, shoot 'em up, oh yeah

Be a hero and die for the glory

Equal opportunity, no discriminatin'
Serves the china white to whoever is waitin'
Ain't no debatin'
No player-hatin', son
So best to run fast or get shot of the M-1
Watch out for the back stabbers, indeed
But the evil takes over, in your eyes is greed
I feel it, gotta kill it, the enemy is close
Keeps the look out, strap's in your hand as you post
Who's afraid of the big black wolf?
Spittin', keeps hittin' from the top of the roof

No needs to switch, still here's the click
Any fool that's tryin' to regulate my bitch
Keeps your mouth shut or hand over when we talk
Po-po's every which way we try to walk
One more body outlined in the chalk
One more do' left open, so I can stalk
Picked up in the back alleys by Little Hawk
Drop me off in the cut, don't come back to this, dog
Kill another nigga for hire
Likes to draw blood, so just call me the vampire
Through fire, y'all best follow the ricket
Too sly, kinda slick, y'all rides the dick
Knick knack patty wack
Beware for the attack or the fuckin' car jack
Oops... smacked upside your head
Killin and killin until my appetite is fed

And start wavin the pistol

I'm a nigga, still struggle in the Compton streets
West coast all day til my life's complete
Like my homie W.C., you don't work, you don't eat
Try to drown out the gunshots wit loud beats
True son of the ghetto, No doubt I'mma ball
Live my life reckless like it snow tomorrow
I win any fuckin shoot 'em up contest
It's no disputin which side's the best
Have gun, niggas will travel
Stay up on it, motherfucker till they slam the gavel
We slang, we jack, We do drive-bys
We fuck wit hoodrats and always stay high
Some shit that we go through
Finger pointing, motherfucker like we know you
Compton, motherfucker, hard act to follow
And ya pride hard to swallow, like love from the hollow


Eiht motherfucker, Always so hood
Catch me in the streets cause nigga it's all good
Only heavy bodyguard I roll wit is the metal
Like a stunt driver when I'm pushin the pedal
Knuckle to knuckle, Don't buckle bob and weave
Reveal the compton tat up under my sleeve
Behind it wit the trigger finger like I was steve
Got the whole town talkin like I was fuckin eve
I'm a product of the pre N.W.A
Wit the quality product tryin to double my pay
To live and die in compton and L.A
It's about one victim like everyday
Fist fight in the liquor store parking lot
Shoot a nigga when he sit up in ya parking spot
Little hustle tryin to make a lot
Like a little bg and his first spot
Geah


You got guns, We got straps
We true to these murder raps, We peel caps
We ain't snitches motherfucker, We just take the charge
That's why I skip bail, Then ran, I'm still at large
These hood niggas televise game for sale
Wannabe motherfuckers in the game should tell
Compton, We gained much respect
You better duck down when the shells eject
And ya little frail chest or vest won't protect
From this true westside compton connect
On ya front porch, Play connect the red dots
Like a photographer aiming for head shots
04, you get eight the hard way
Even in broad day, the sound of ricochet
This ain't denzel on the set, it's been hell
E wit the four-o federal mail

We sending this one out right here
To all the young thug and young hustlers out there
You know I'm sayin', grown up with their moms strugglin'
In the hood yo' I'm sayin', ya know how it is
Trying to keep it tight, you know I'm sayin'
Geah
Born and raised a black youth, no happy days
My moms and pops went they separate ways
Now she solo with half the dough, and three kids
No house, a damn tight situation we in
Hit the streets to look for work and pay
So her kids can have it better than she had one day
Try to teach me some rules, ""get a's in school
Keep your head up high and don't run with the fools""
That was the lesson, always listen to moms
Bible she totin, always quotin from psalms
Young but I'm knowin' the right thang to do
Know the things to say when times is blue
Times is hard and really unfortunate
I'm young and I really don't like the shit
But I dream nice things when I sleep at night
When I grow up I'll make everything alright
Sing
Soultre':
I know it's hard sometimes
But if you can make a way, you need to hold up
I know a better way
And if you can wait today it'll be alright...
Eiht:
Now I'm 15, my life done hit a split screen
What used to be a good kid struck a bad gene
Bad dreams, young thugs and crime scenes
Skip school, saggin' my jeans and blow green
My moms don't know where I get the shit from
If you keep trippin' you know the outcome
Laid up somewhere, or in jail
Makin' collect calls tryin' to make bail
Hell, and you know how I struggle for the cheddar
Before I give it away better get it together
My guilty conscience sayin' not no listen
The other have tellin' me, keep a good intention
Aw shit, a nigga need a mind of his own
Too much to deal with, I really don't feel shit
Young thug ready to take on the world
Who made my life take such a twirl
C'mon
Chorus...
Now my situation's changed, no chains remain
Now I try to check out the game and cause pain
Long live the days of homeboys and straps
Gang of tombstones for the ones that caught caps
Make snaps off raps, reminiscin' of days
Good part is shot up while 'more bounce' plays
Missin the days sometimes, but keeps my eyes on the future
Keep my hands on my heat cause niggas might shoot ya
Rob a nigga blind, just like stevie
I used to do the same when a nigga was greedy
But my come-up was wrong, flipped it, now it's strong
Now I clocks snaps, keep the street shit in my songs
Trying to make it up on a stage from doin' a bid
Trying to make a better way like she did for my kids
Right now watch out, keep my nose to the grind
Yeah boy, this world is mine

Switches we bouncing it low-low

Cops try to gather that info-
-mation. Frustration
Who in the fuck left these shell cases?

Real gangstas won't talk and don't snitch
Gang-banging niggas who won't switch
Live by the model and trust no bitch
Get your papers
Beaten so they can'st evade us
On it we know it's the fucking best
To d-day we die so fuck the rest
If you got beef get that shit off your chest
Open your brain in your bulletproof vest
Compton, the city, we standing tall
Gang raw phone call


Hood rats, gang tats
Dope trying to stash under car mats
Police asking where the guns at?
Jack and boy you better lay flat
One stab, jump in and pop
Breath in real hard as you duck from the cops
Fleeing the scene or the evidence drops?
Keep making moves, avoiding the stops
Tired from all the fences you hop?
Get away clean and you setting up shop
Either stay or transform
Slip and homeboy you be heading to court
Telling your niggas to hold down the fort
Send them some flicks and a little support
Stressed out, stretched out
You know what county jail life's all about


Gang man, strap in hand
Money is made on the corners we stand
Money is wrapped with the rubber band
Shoot them up when enemies roll in
Gun spark, car crash
Mission complete, so collect the cash
No need to floss, so build up your stash
Hiding my face, the cameras flash
Top notch, grab your crotch
Now the block trying to form neighborhood watch
They gonna keep hating the way that I am
Keep shooting and hoping my guns don't jam
Who dipping again? We don't give a fuck

Got Cha Humpin’,Last Man Standing,1997,"Geah
My nigga muggs in the house
Who keeps you humpin'
Eihthype keeps you thumpin'
Always into somethin'
Westside got it going on
Westside got it going on
Who creeps in smooth with moves like gotti
Trips to make grips and back to the party
Million dollar holler with the jazzy belles
97 makes moves with the freaky tales
Hold up, stop the presses
Floats to the club and show me love in little short dresses
From 8 at night till 6 in the morn'
Intend to get ? naked? , try to put me on
Tick tock, it don't stop, clock keeps tickin'
Pour one more and wait for the liquor to kick in
Lookin suspicious cause you don't know the game plan
To the v.i.p. you peeps the ? three span?
Naughty as I wanna be, so check it
Drama to the women I perfected to get naked
2 shots of the v.s.o.p. rémy
Converstions as I tugs on your bikini
Got to get it, cause I've never had
Takes the party back to my pad, color me bad
Oops... I swoops up in the coupe
One more pussy to loop, I'm knockin the boots
Geah
Who got you humpin'
Eihthype's always bumpin'
Always into somethin' (geah)
Westside's got it goin' on
Number one desperado, packin the hollows
In a nice tight suit with christy to swallow
Who's the role model, bitch butt-naked on the boat
'cross the lake, we skate with the heavy weights
Can you feel me? surfs all night, be rich
500 super sport, low-low's hittin' the switch
Gots long dough, fo' sho', cops paid by the month
Weekly in the club, gots ho's to hunt
Gets mine, nose to the grind, makes cheese
Ain't never seen three niggas like these
Still gots the connects, pulls china white from muggs
Rolex, more sex by the compton thugs
Senoritas and peso's for the amigos
Wherever the wind blows, you're sure to see those
Heavyweight hustlers that got the green
Chronic, snaps and bitches, the american dream
Geah
Chorus...
Makes me wanna throw my hands up and holler
It all seems like a dream
How we gettin the cream and still in impalas, c'mon
If you gots the time, then I gots the time
Best not be that bitch dropped dime
Stops my money flow, where's my money, hoe?
Out the door, watch the pimp with the gangsta limp
Limo rides, westside, I keep it crackin
Thousand dollar suits while the gators keep snappin
Bird flies in, top dollar bitches to stab
Sets up nice on boom bam ab
Makes me laugh sometimes... ha-ha
Fine bitches and money makes me do the cha cha
Ooh-lah-lah, 'cross the board money to spend
Open the door, bitch, get in

When I Go,UnKnown,2004.0,"Yeah, once again, Tony Smallz, smoke in the city, you get it?
Do you get it? Some of the Compton knowledge

I remember how a nigga steal car in a  struggle
While my mind plays tricks to lifestyles I juggle
My sides to geminize two souls evolve
If one get indicted, I try to rewrite it, yeah
I'm a victim to the ghetto
The steps I tried to walk for my fellows
Damn what I seen at age thirteen
Six shots is all you get with no 
My true experience, you don’t know what you're speak
How the fuck you think that a nigga like me sleep
Like a baby I fight sleep 'cause I might miss something
And that something is money, you ain’t eating? Man that shit's funny
Whenever I sell, y'all hate it
Neighborhood debated, confiscate it , what?
Y'all put me here  dope and guns and now y'all fear

Where I go, bitches go get free ass
Niggas in the street waving blue and red flags
Where I go you get work for nice prices
They hit your damn switches  and get high with no licence
Where I go you can carry a strap
Roll around with your window down
Head in your lap
Where I go, every hood no beef
Roll around, shooting, saluting, fuck the police
I'm a boy in the hood, menace to society

Young black teen they just stuck on the block
When a tramp no  snub-nose pocket watch
With a high flood market trying to fluff up my stocks
Yeah, you know the gangbang model G
Straight down the main line  strong
Man I've been through warzones
Since this fucking day we've been getting it on
Two wrongs don’t make a right
What the fuck is left
Draw slow and you get shot to death
And I done seen too many things, enemies too
Revenge came, serving we never stingy’
Dirt we're been 
Compton, motherfuckers
I can feel the envy
If y’all lend me a strap
I be the first motherfucker out the court and cap

Where I go, bitches go get free ass
Niggas in the street waving blue and red flags
Where I go you get work for nice prices
They hit your damn switches  and get high with no licence
Where I go you can carry a strap
Roll around with your window down
Head in your lap
Where I go, every hood no beef
Roll around, shooting, saluting, fuck the police

When I die is nothing but 
Some of y'all fools still direspect it
My nigga from the west saying ride till' we die
So I hope there's heaven for a G like I
I’m hopeless, I've been gunning forever
Me and my man strapped up running togheter
G I didn't ask to be a shooter
Young cub lost in the jungle lost fighting for food
I've made the wrong move
It's started by nature
I'm sorry if the motherfucker bullet mistake ya
Hey
Innocent's lost, yeah I know what you feel
When I see the homie die yeah that hurt me for real
That's why I do what I feel
Shoot em' up bang bang 
When i bang to kill
Showed up, west spot just playing with your life till' I'm aiming to die

Where I go, bitches go get free ass
Niggas in the street waving blue and red flags
Where I go you get work for nice prices
They hit your damn switches and get high with no licence
Where I go you can carry a strap
Roll around with your window down
Head in your lap
Where I go, every hood no beef
Roll around shooting saluting, fuck the police
Where I go, bitches go get free ass
Niggas in the street waving blue and red flags (And the gangesters)
Where I go you get work for nice prices (And the thugs)
They hit your damn switches and get high with no licence (Spittin' real )
Where I go you can carry a strap
Roll around with your window down
Head in your lap

Shooters salute fuck the police
Yeah,  forever, you get it?

Geah
Geah
Hoo-Bang, nigga
Some of that futuristic shit
For that ass
Keepin it thuggish, though
Check it out

The concrete streets bring heat, it's so rough
Niggas test everyday, calling your bluff
Eiht had enough, I'm smoking my fluff
Spitting game, letting you know my turf is tough
My theme is I push music to driveby
I slide through, scoop up four and ride high
Strap under the seat my hood technique
As I destroy your block like _Dante's Peak_
Feel me, partly a killer, clocker for fun
On my turf puttin in work since day one
Y'all ain't heard enough about a nigga singin the blues
Niggas bendin in two's while y'all watch the news
John Walsh, wash me up, you're crazy
Havin my face captured 180
Can't go there, ain't havin that, man, fuck
The strap turned me corrupt, so prepare to duck

Sometimes in the hood it's so rough
That makes niggas from the hood stay tough
Slings packs, pack straps, quarters and halfs
16, double the stash, you do the math (2x)

I guess my mind's on the track, gotta get me a stack
And in fact, homebody, you know what gun I pack
Keeps y'all enemies close that stay cheatin
When they ask make fast and start heatin
Niggas ain't fuckin around - dodge mine
Drop yours, bitch, and lay that ass down
Keep your face to the ground, don't even look
No positive ID and all the money was took
Shook the hell up out the spot and kept away from snitches
Took a trip across town just to floss my riches
Bitches turn into niggas and start yappin
One more hit on your house where y'all nappin
Dumpin one, catch you in the midnight, the late night hour
The hollow point shower
The sweet success thatt you taste has got sour
Straight, Eiht regulate my thug power


My niggas disappoint me thinkin y'all can fade it
Still player-hated, wishin y'all made it
Stay down, Hoo-Bangin niggas takin over
G's in lows puttin holes up in a Rover
Told ya, stop tryin to walk in our shoes
Real thugs hail from the west, first rule
In fact, we the first Bloods and Crips
First niggas to drive by sendin tricks on trips
First niggas to hit yo town and set up shop
Bring the prices down low, y'all pick the rest to cop
Copy cats, now y'all dippin lows with heats
Pepetratin Fresh Coast, tryin to roll our streets
Hate your sight, catch you on a red-eye flight
Commence the sweatin the groove just for spite
Lucky though, I give you a pass and let you go
I'mma catch you on the road at another rap show

Geah
Hoo-Bang, nigga
That makes niggas from the turf stay tough

I'mma keep yellin compton for life
Although the ghetto bring a motherfucker stress to strife
At night, hear the gunshots, somebody dyin
Murder on the front line, mama be cryin
It's her firstborn, all the lines been torn
How long will mama only son should mourn?
To the streets is my motherfuckin lord to sworn
Out the do' when I hear my fuckin o.g.'s horn
To the homie 6 feet, a little liquor we pourin
Down the ave statin where the girls be whorin
One times is hot on the trail
Destined to stack us in the county jail
Police ain't a friend to me, pop at the enemy
Fire out the hole life smoke at the chimney
There's so many young souls lost
The hood life you gon pay at a high cost

 Fresh out the hood, We made it
These motherfuckin dues, Homeboy we paid it
 This gangsta shit, We made it
These motherfuckin dues, Homeboy we paid it
 Fresh out the hood, we made it
These motherfuckin dues, Homeboy we paid it
 Homeboy, We made it, This motherfuckin gangsta

I remember when it all started, Runnin around actin retarded
Jumpin out on anybody livin life cold hearted
I'll hold him while you sock 'em up
Go in his pockets cause you know we don't give a fuck
Nigga what? This Compton, breaded and branded, sets landed
But fools be softies and I can't understand it
We went from small change to big change
Flipped up the game and remain the same
Blow weed, get dope, and chase all the hoes
Fresh white tee, slammin 6 tre dough
And stay ready to kick up dust
Cause it's a rumor in the city they gon spit at us
So they had to be ready for niggas to rock steady
Can't get caught without it, So don't sweat me
But these fools is fake and gold plated
Livin outdated while I'm laughin, Screamin out we made it


I'm out the ragtop 6 tre, dub's in the sky
Blunt gettin me high, it's do or die
Reminiscing on how we used to laugh and joke
Goin half on the o.e. lookin for smoke
I was the getaway driver, you rolled shotgun
Motherfuckers surrounded the car, you shot one
In broad day light, whenever we took flight
I'mma revenge the death boy with all my might
Hand me a light so I can spark up the blunt
Smoke until my finger tips then go on a hunt
Best not stunt, I'mma stay low key
Creep up when you comin out slowly
Wit the rag round my face, you don't know me
I'm a neighborhood menace to my enemy

If you wit your homies, still shoot up the car",https://genius.com/Mc-eiht-we-made-it-04-lyrics

Drove off in the alley so I can hit they gates
And release the wooden handle 38 with dub take

Niggas with police scanners tryna to stay one step ahead of us one time stop the 

Where u from?
I’m from the land of the B’s and’s and C’s, west coast westside for these real OG’s

Street smart, the OG’s talk, them enemies runnin’ them motherfuckers get caught
Bark me and double up and then came the heater
A couple of tattoos sporting a wifebeater
I’m loco, stone cold, police chokeholds  to be fucking stole
A khaki suit, a bandana and loc’d and the two C’s stand for Compton Criminal
Wait a minute niggas, you know I’m still with it, the hood in my lyrics, fuck it I represent it

Make the gang signs wave?
But the hood is where we be
And rest in peace to the brave
Little something to the fallen heroes
All the thug niggas
Rest in peace to all the hoods

III The Hood Way,UnKnown,UnKnown,"When I hear the words: murda murda, I concern a
Slug in your burden brain
Niggas heard of me
From here to eternity
F*ck hell cause I can feel the Earth burn in me
Now we can meet, we can greet, we can see, we can eat
We can hold court in the street
Whatcha wanna do?
I just ate, it's a quarter to 8
I'm in Section 8 with MC Eiht and a 38 (yeah)
And I'm ready to ride for this shit
Muthaf*cka done invested his life in this shit
And we ain't losin' rather take a penitentiary chance
And ?? your house like some blue and red ends
Make you dance like Holyfield
And we'll rob you like Lennox Lewis
And you can't do nuthin' to us (nuthin')
Spent my life with the West Rollies
A few of 'em still gangbangin in they 40's, what
Violatin parolies
Ye-ye-ye-e
Gangstas make the world go round
And stayin' down in the Y-2-K
That's what they say
It's Hoo-Bang muthaf*cka and we don't play
Eiht, Cube and Mack: III tha hood way, geah
I said...
Mack 10 is the lick, West Side is the click (yeah)
I can't get enough of this gangsta shit
So I drag my 5-7 down the shores and the skate
???? play some vibrate for humpin' Section 8
I stay G'd up and down, it's the bumper when it's late
With my hair bitch-braid sportin' murder one shades
It's the heat bringer, king Inglewood swinger
And f*ck every nigga that ain't a Hoo-Banger (Hoo-Banger!)
No color lines make dimes, it's color blind
And I ain't trippin' cause your rag ain't bright as mine
Let's rock T-Birds up, sew up the place
Get on the paper chase and let us smoke our free base
I'm a straight go-getter, grinded till I'm rich
I stay down and dirty and screamin' f*ck a bitch (f*ck you bitch!)
Me, Eiht and Don Mega off the hook together
It's III tha hood way and Hoo-Bang forever, what
Three niggas, three time felons with three strikes (yeah)
Three times equal 9's, khakis and knives
Roll on swings as I bumps the flashlight
Nice off I flip to the hard, my shit's tight
Small nigga in the backseat with Loc's
Tryin' to come up on cash cause we downer at last
Gun smoke, my tramp 8's start to spittin'
Put the hood I scream loud, give a f*ck who I'm hittin'
WEST SIDE Compton, Hoo-Bang' fo' sho'
Put they work for my G's, six feet below
The murda show, muthaf*ckas ride with me
There's one life to live so I cops the key
Once upon a time in the projects with heat
Slangin' my shit: you don't work, you don't eat
You can take this boy out tha hood
But you can't take the hood out a nigga
Hand stays on the trigga, geah
III tha hood way ye-yey (fo' sho')
III tha hood way ye-yey (for the 9-9 fool)
III tha hood way ye-yey (you know how tha f*ck we do it)
III tha hood way ye-yey (Hoo-Bangin' fo' life!)
Yeah (geah)
Geah
The Compton shit
MC Eiht (tha criminal shit)
For your ass
Ice Cube (dumpin' out the Trey)
Dumpin' out the Rag seven
Mack 10 (givin' yo' ass just what you need)
That thug shit
West Side Hoo-Bangin' gangstas
Compton fo' life
Geah

We Made It ’04 (feat. Tha Chill),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Tha Chill)

Geah! Geah!
Fresh out the hood, We made it
This gangsta shit, We paid it
G-g-g-g-geah, Cmon

I'ma keep yellin compton for life
Although the ghetto bring a motherfucker stress to strife
At night, hear the gunshots, somebody dyin
Murder on the front line, mama be cryin
It's her firstborn, all the lines been torn
How long will mama only son should mourn?
To the streets is my motherfuckin lord to sworn
Out the do' when I hear my fuckin o.g.'s horn
To the homie 6 feet, a little liquor we pourin
Down the ave statin where the girls be whorin
One times is hot on the trail
Destined to stack us in the county jail
Police ain't a friend to me, pop at the enemy
Fire out the hole life smoke at the chimney
There's so many young souls lost
The hood life you gon pay at a high cost
[Chorus: MC Eiht (Tha Chill)
(We made it) Fresh out the hood, We made it
These motherfuckin dues, Homeboy we paid it
(We made it) This gangsta shit, We made it
These motherfuckin dues, Homeboy we paid it
(We made it) Fresh out the hood, we made it
These motherfuckin dues, Homeboy we paid it
(We made it) Homeboy, We made it, This motherfuckin gangsta

I remember when it all started, Runnin around actin retarded
Jumpin out on anybody livin life cold hearted
I'll hold him while you sock 'em up
Go in his pockets cause you know we don't give a fuck
Nigga what? This Compton, breaded and branded, sets landed
But fools be softies and I can't understand it
We went from small change to big change
Flipped up the game and remain the same
Blow weed, get dope, and chase all the hoes
Fresh white tee, slammin 6 tre dough
And stay ready to kick up dust
Cause it's a rumor in the city they gon spit at us
So they had to be ready for niggas to rock steady
Can't get caught without it, So don't sweat me
But these fools is fake and gold plated
Livin outdated while I'm laughin, Screamin out we made it


I'm out the ragtop 6 tre, dub's in the sky
Blunt gettin me high, it's do or die
Reminiscing on how we used to laugh and joke
Goin half on the o.e. lookin for smoke
I was the getaway driver, you rolled shotgun
Motherfuckers surrounded the car, you shot one
In broad day light, whenever we took flight
I'ma revenge the death boy with all my might
Hand me a light so I can spark up the blunt
Smoke until my finger tips then go on a hunt
Best not stunt, I'ma stay low key
Creep up when you comin out slowly
Wit the rag round my face, you don't know me
I'm a neighborhood menace to my enemy
Geah, it's just the way we are
If you wit your homies, still shoot up the car",https://genius.com/Mc-eiht-we-made-it-04-feat-tha-chill-lyrics
Streiht Up Menace (West Coast Classics),West Coast Classics Radio,UnKnown,"Wake yo' punk-ass up for the '93 shot
MC Eiht's in the motherfuckin' house, gyeah
And it ain't nothin' but a Compton thing, y'all
And we ain't nothin' but Niggas On Tha Run
And this goes out to my niggas, gyeah

A fucked up childhood is why the way I am
It's got me in the state where I don't give a damn
Hmm, somebody help me
But nah, they don't hear me though
I guess I'll be another victim of the ghetto
Ain't no escapin', 'cause I'm way too young
Pops is dealin', and on top of that got Moms sprung
Scheamin' off the top, Pops never figured
That he'd go down by the hands of another nigga
Now my pops is gone and that ain't no good
Got to follow in the footsteps of the homies from the hood
And where's the role model?
Niggas puttin' brew in my fuckin' baby bottle
Damn! And through all the motherfuckin' pain
They done drove my moms insane
So, I guess I gotta do work so I ain't finished
I grow up to be a streiht up menace, gyeah

Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace

Now I'm of age, and livin' in the projects
Gettin' paid off the clucks and the county checks
I'm Fil-ia fresh outta high school, never did I wonder
That the motherfuckin' hood would take me under
Gyeah, I'm kickin' it with the homies and they got the straps
Off to the corner store, owned by the fuckin' (Japs)
See a bitch in the right lane, so I comes with the mack
Astro Van pulls a motherfuckin' jack from the back
Now he's got the strap to my homie's head
Sayin': ""Play that shit cool, and don't be a fool!""
He shot my nigga in the fuckin' head
I caught one in the shoulder, if I didn't run I was dead
Now I'm layin' in the hospital bed
Thinkin' about them punk motherfuckers
And my eyes is bloodshot red
Gyeah, motherfuckers, I ain't finished
Be on the look-out for the streiht up menace, gyeah

Uhh, whassup, y'all?
Streiht up menace
Damn!
Really, really
Streiht up menace
Damn!

I'm in too deep
I done killed a motherfucker and I just can't sleep
One-Time's tryin' to do a smooth creep
And on top of that
Niggas after me for fuckin' one of they hood rats
I ain't got time for the fuckin' bitch's story
Niggas want me gotta come to my territory
And ain't no 'you can get the fist'
Niggas come, and they get done on they own risk
What is it all about?
Should I leave or should I stay, 'cause I don't wanna punk out
Oh what should I do?
The homies say: ""The hood's where it's good
Homeboy, I thought you knew.""
So in the process to show the hood my best
No time to react, caught two in the chest
Now look who's down, I guess I'm finished
I go out like a streiht up menace, gyeah

Uhh, come on, y'all
Streiht up menace
Damn!

And on and on
I guess we outta here
Peace to my niggas on the run
And it ain't nothin' but streiht up menaces, damn!
Just like I said before, y'all
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thing
And MC Eiht's in the house for the '93 shot
And this one's for the niggas, gyeah",https://genius.com/Mc-eiht-streiht-up-menace-west-coast-classics-lyrics
The Brew Took Me Unda,DJ Drank’s Greatest Malt Liquor Hits,UnKnown,"Here ye, here ye, y'all come kick it (Get a taste, get a taste)
Here ye, here ye, y'all come kick it (Get a taste, get a taste)
The hood done took me under, no wonder
I'm still, chillin' in the city with no pity
Stepped on my front porch to check my spot
 to the store to get that crooked I shot
I gots to have it in my body
Bring about two or three cases to the party
Yeah, don't give me that old school chicken bottle
Don't try to fool son, I want the cool one
The black can is the one that I'm lookin' for
Make a stop at your neighborhood liquor store
I save a quarter, just to pour it down
Know it tastes good to my homies *censored*
My Gs  and we chill like the outsiders
On my front lawn, profilin' low-riders'
I hit the main *censored* get loose
Reached in my pocket, get out my deuce-deuce
