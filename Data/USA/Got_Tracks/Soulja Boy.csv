My niggas winnin' we don't see no contenders
My niggas go hard, my niggas stack millis
I'm swervin', ridin' and I'm drivin' in Bentleys
I'm over in Illi, I'm rockin' it silly
I'm rockin' Fendi and she lookin' like ""really?""
Benjis on Benjis while swervin' in Bentleys
We watchin' for the cops, niggas be snitchin'

We stack it, pack it, stack it up to the ceilin'

All of my niggas we get it
All of my niggas we kill it
Catch the case then quit it
Niggas get acquitted, got money cause we got no limits
I'm trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen

All of you niggas you gotta get it
All of my niggas we got to get it
Used to trap out the bank with 20 pounds of midgets
20 pounds of midget, that's what I'm trappin'
No cappin' had to make my momma happy

Fuckin' the 100s, I don't do the ones

New Drip,Fuego,2019.0,"I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
F&N, Draco, extended 30 and it sittin' on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I just might go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I’m international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin' them

Hop in Bugatti, push it to the maximum
Young Drako, nigga I’m drippin' blood just like Dracula
In the kitchen, in the trap with a spatula
Whippin' up dope, it's looking spectacular
Bitch in London fell in love with vernacular
Count a hundred fifty K, smoking dope, watching cameras
I'm sippin' codeine and smoking on cannabis
Jump on a private jet and now I'm trappin'

I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended 30 and it sittin’ on my hip

Flex on that nigga, I made a quarter million
Slide through the city, a matte black Bentley
Black Murci'  like Batman

Pinky ring sittin' on my wrist cost a black Jag'
Nigga, we drop them bombs just like Baghdad (Boom!)
We shootin' first, nigga no we don't clap back
Walk in the VIP, broke nigga back-back
I got a hundred and fifty thousand in my backpack
Smoking on backwoods, rolling up dope, serving good crack
Serving the junkies and fucking the hoodrats
Come to your zone and you know the way I took that
Nigga fell off, ain't shoot back
Eliantte got me shining for real
Run up on Drako, get popped like a pill
Make the wrong move, boy this shit could get real
I went and dropped a ticket on my ear
Pour up a pint, I'm sippin' lean not beer
Pull up on plug, then I disappear
VVS diamond, they looking so clear
Bust down my Rollie, it's looking like burr
A hundred fifty thousand Richard Mille
Zone 1 was signing apartments and trap with the steel
I cannot stop 'til I get a billion
Stupid ass mansion with racks to the ceiling

With green like I'm Peter Pan

Man, you don't understand
I just talked to God today
I said ""Give me another chance!""
So I'm back in the hood
And I'm trying to flip the bands

And pulled up the kickstand
Now the hoes on my dick
Cause the tats on my hands
And my hand gripping wheel
Behind the 2012 van
Mane, I pull up in the truck
And my goons duffled up
Got the bricks and the kush
In the loud pat whaat
Mane, you know what's going down
When I pull up in the drop and

Til my young ass retire
And I'm posted in the back of the coupe

Haters talking slick, they filled with anger
But I don't care so god damn ya
This big ass watch costs more than yours
I built a house you can't afford
It's stupid big, got an ocean view
It's way up there, I look down on you
We flex down here, that's what we do
Get in my way, I flex on you
You acting monkey, we keep bannanas
Keep them goons with me, Gucci bandanna

Speakers Going Hammer,The DeAndre Way,2010.0,"I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit the club, we be so deep
Mayne I'm deep in the game I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a OZ
Follow me like the Wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cause it is so neat
Ask about me in the streets I spit so heat
Ain’t nobody in the game messing with my clique
Style swift hot like it’s July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn’t
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin' money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy, it’s not fair

I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

I remember back in the days, mayne I was broke
These days Soulja Tell 'Em run a hundred spokes
No joke, mayne I’m balling out the atmosphere
Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here
I gotta my speakers going ham in my Lamborghini
Two door coupe, girl in bikini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swag
She so Fabolous, they way she throw it in the bag
Its young soulja soulja mayne I swear I’m popping tags
Back then, you could catch me in a Pontiac
These days drop top Phantom with a 100 stacks
Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
I’m getting money man what the fuck a bitch think
Young Soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer
Like Rick Ross bitch I think I’m MC Hammer

I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning

Grammy,The DeAndre Way,2010.0,"I done seen a lot of things in my life
I've been in a lot of situations
Y'know that I just think that the world should hear my story
You know I am saying? I think I'm here for a reason
All of what I have obtained so far has been off the strength of me
Y'know grindin so hard and, and stayin so determined
And I just think that, my story has to be heard...

What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?

Party like a rock star, hit 'em with the hot bars
Fast like a NASCAR, lime like my dad's car
I deserve a Grammy; will I fly away
Or land on Miami? I don't have time to rhyme
But I do have time to grind
S.O.D. pirates, I don't need a hook
My lyrics illustrated verses taken from a book
I understand the fans, supply and demand
Crunk at command, fight and we'll stand
Lyrics from a true legend, livin life through God's blessing
Big papers, long acres, top flight, no security
Black ice on me, call the jury
Yahh trick yahh, and we call it magic
My style may change if you call it drastic
Money so long and we is the measure
I love my business and I love my pleasure
Live now, die later, internet genius
Self proclaimed he a critically acclaimed
For the fortune and fame, he'll run through the rain
For a million in change, takin over the game

Kidnap the world 'til they pay my ransom

I done stepped in the club, god damn I made it rain
Ball like Major Payne, 2 straps like Max Payne
Niggas talking about me, SOD on me
SOD on everything man, this my life
God damn I love this shit, I wouldn't trade it for shit
I done fucked 20 hoes, word around the globe
Made a bitch touch her toes
Made her took off all her clothes
Ocean Gang can drown, I be standing on the stage
With a 100 million dollars like ""God damn I'm paid""
Lil Dre be this shit, nigga fuck what ya heard
Talking down on my clique, get flipped like a bird, bitch!

Niggas mad at, mad at me
Bitches mad at me
10 chains, 5 rings, I'm the Swag Daddy
Bitch is talking down, but I'mma swag gladly
Niggas is talking down, Bitch I make my family happy
Niggas mad at me, bitches mad at me
10 chains, 5 rings, I'm the Swag Daddy
Niggas mad, bitch what I'mma swag gladly
I never gave a fuck, I make my family happy

LV shades on and my pants saggin
Screaming ""Ocean Gang or drown!"" I'm the Swag Daddy
Niggas mad cause I ride, and my paint candy
Niggas talking down, bitch, my swag outstanding!
Looking like I done came from another planet
Looking like I done swagged about another million
God damn, I'm some shit that you've never seen
I'm so fresh, look like I came out your dreams
Lil Dre bitch, I'm my brother's keeper
AK-47, switched it for the heat seeker
I'mma find you if you talking down
I'm the swag daddy bitch, that's word around town
Disrespect SOD, bitch it's going down
I'm not Yung Joc, bitches going down
Swag nonstop in my fucking town
Welcome to my city: let's go smoke 100 pounds


All that I'm hearing is Soulja Boy is getting cake
I don't ever go to sleep, how the fuck I'm gonna wake & bake
They call me Lil Dre, condo by the fuckin lake
The fuck you niggas smokin? Mission by the fuckin ocean
Bitch tried to kick me off the plane
Cause my pants saggin
Went and caught the private jet cause I'm the swag daddy
Niggas mad cause my swag's so outstanding
Pull up to the red carpet, hopping out the Phantom
I gives a fuck what you think: I do what I want to
Ride through my trap, throwing money out the sunroof
If I said it on the track, then I fucking mean it
Pretty Boy Swag: I'm so damn conceited!
And I look like a fucking genius!
Standing on the tv screen: nigga suck my penis
No homo bitch, bitch I'm rich, and I fucking mean it
God damn I smoke that purp, and that shit is stinkin

Diss me last week, next week missin' fuck your opinion

Similar to Jbar I'm in a daze

Shoot at you duck niggas like a fuckin' gun range
Hottest in the rap game; title I obtain
Sumo money, I got heavy paper
Press me it's going down like a elevator
I'm not political correct, I'm not a legislator
Cross tattoo below my eye rest in peace to all my haters
Nigga I don't play boy, I'm not Hugh Hefner
Bunnies in my mansion, and it ain't even Ester.(laughs)
Drop it drop it low girl
Futurism Chris Brown, I can transform her
I'm a fucking genius, Jimmy Neutron
Rich nigga shit, Grey Poupon
Beats: blazin' them, fans: amazing them
Water diamonds on my neck come and take a swim
Guard your life with them, cause you might drown
No lifeguard guaranteed you going down
Speaking to existence, nigga I'm the best
Open my Louis cases looking like a treasure chest
You don't want beef so stay outta harms way
Blow your legs off have you looking like a mermaid
Runnin' at the mouth shut you up like a suitcase
Eat any rapper I'll have his ass soufleed
All year 365, February to February
The only place where success comes before work is inside the dictionary
Niggas say I'm gassed up, fuck you mean? Fuck gasoline
Any rapper on any beat, I'll chop your head nigga gilitene
Fake rappers dissin' me like I would forget
Niggas say they gettin money but it's counterfeit
My name gigantic, I sink em, titanic

They thinking got dammit Soulja Boy's flow is Cajun
I'm drawing on this beat do you get the illustration?
Everybody hate it
I'm balling so hard I should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated
Yeah I navigate it, then escalade it
Twitter king 2 million in your faces
I'm saying my graces, I'm bout to eat all of ya
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em I'm a one man orchestra
Instructional videos on you tube
So I can teach you how to do what I do
Haters wanna knock me, but I'm not a damn door
I got a million dollars cash laid across this damn floor
Word around town they got money on my head
Bitch I pull that fuckin chopper and they scramble like eggs
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em that this shit is historical
All the newspapers put this in your editorial
Teach you niggas, swag tutorial

Gas,King Soulja 3,2014.0,"I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

Went and dropped 7 hunnid on my Robin jeans
Mix the gas with the lean, call it gas-o-lean
Hittin' play bustin' juug, bitch it's Rich Gang
30 diamonds in my wrist, start my fireflame
Bugs Bunny mad at me, I got all the carats
When I hop out the Ferrari all the bitches starin'
I drive a 'Gatti or the new McLaren
I went and dropped 30 piece on each of my earrings
Double cup while I'm ridin' in my new foreign
I got choppa, I got racks, bitch, yo man borin'
I just step in KOD, all my cash pourin'
Sippin' lean and the Act' and it got me snorin'

I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank

Havin' the plug on the gas
Havin' the plug on the mid
Havin' the plug on the choppa, the beam
Havin' the plug on the six
30k Rollie on my arm
50k VVS diamond my charm
I got the bomb like Osama
Sending my troops overseas like Obama
Hit the pot with the left hook, now they mad at me
When I pull up in that drop, oh yeah, it's that dab daddy
Shooters on go and that's automatic
Bad bitches gettin' too dramatic
Quavo makes movies, I'm cinematic
Lowkey with the fight like the Hidden Dragon

Whippin' the brick, now my hand got that arthritis
Pistol locked up in his mouth, he got gingivitis
Pull up in ghost like Michael Myers
I’m the plug in my city, I got plenty buyers
Soulja keep telling me he got the cipher, the law ticket
I'ma pull up and come get it, my money is tall as a midget
And I got J's, they gon' come back like frisbee's
Certified Keisha (Gas!), you gotta pay me monifa
Loud beatin' loud like a speaker, pull out the choppa and eat'cha
Whippin' the particles, and I got two bricks, they lookin' identical
My plug is an alien, don’t got no tentacles
But he pull up with the batch of the vegetables
You can even come and get you some edibles

I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
Lean in my cup, gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank

Uh, Soulja Boy Tellem, uh
I love females who like to wear their toes out
Call me a fire hydrants, I bring them hoes out
I got a lot of people want whats hanging from neck
Call me what you want, just don?t call me collect
Tell me whats the deal, what to do with this beef shit
Say fuck me on youtube and when you see me you didn't do shit I don't believe you rappers, who you kidding dog
Save your lame game for your muthafucking memory cards

I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes

I just wanna be successful

Hip Hop is like school yeah I had to learn it
Beef is like a blank disc yeah I had to burn it
They finally showing me respect but I had to earn it
I'm heading to the finish line ain't got no time for U-turns
Today I realized I am not perfect
Everything I did to get here wasn't really worth it
Why won't they just let me be Great
You fall down seven times you stand up eight
Realize true happiness lies inside of you
Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo
The birds sing after the muthafucking storm gone
If you want to sing, you can always sing this song
Turn my swag on is my theme song
Theres a 95% chance that it used to be your ringtone
I got swiss in the cheese but I don't yodel
Heart tatted in my neck they love my vocals


As I sit back and spit this crack
I leak it on the internet and watch my haters react
Fifty said they can't read between the lines
So I jab uppercut punch line after punch line
Know your thinking damn Soulja going hard right now
And I'm thinking damn, this is just a star right now
Soulja Boy is gone on the renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade


Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future
Thats real shit

My goons over-protective
Smoking presidential
My weed is elected
I am well-respected
I am well-connected
I am in the hood
In the hood nigga section
You girl is my food
I had her for breakfast
And after we sexed man
I left that bitch breathless
This is not school
So please do not test this
My flow is illegal
My vocals arrested
You don't want beef
You must know the police
Your girl sucked on my dick
And it felt like she had no teeth
Soulja Boy Tell Em'
Yeah I am a beast man
In hip-hop I go ham
Now let's have a feast man
I am a dog
A dog off the leash man
If you feel like a frog
Than go ahead and leap man
I'm on my green shit
My football field team shit
You're on your wack shit
That you have no swag shit
I might fuck your girl
Or I might just fuck that bitch
Or that bitch, or that bitch, or that bitch, or that bitch
After I fuck make her make me a sandwich
I am so random
Girls think that's handsome
Haters hate mad throwimg temperature tantrums
Soulja Boy killed them
Fucked them
Downed them

Arab!
Call me Arab but I'm not pakistani
Sprunt to your granny
Cause that ho cand stand me
I am the man
That's why I demand money
Hop on the track so fast
Call me Arab Bunny
Scratch that Arab Money
Laughin, Arab Stutin
In you hors face and I keep on cuming
Song after song
I continue to be bumping
I'm right and your wrong
You continue to be nothing
I got bars, I got cars
I got hors I'm a star
I got mars on my side
The aliens are down to ride
It took me two nights to do What I did tonight
I'm so high
Why the fuck do I catch a Flight?
You're girls leaking problem Just got handled by the pipe
Me and you are the same, really, sike!
Bitch I go harder than a Train on full throttle
Followed by Godzilla
Followed by you and salt Rockets
My money so fire
Give you real hot pockets
Tryna hate on S.O.D
Aw bitch stop it!
My watch still tocking
Saying that it is my time
The crowd rocking
Arab, they screaming
It took a lot of grinding
So you better keep on Dreaming
Or better start thinking
Of a master plan
I throw away the cats
And I collect all the cash
Of course I am gorgeous
I collect all the facts

I pull up in Lamborghini's
Stuntin through your city
You can never see me
'Less your looking through a TV
The cheese like I'm Mickey
The brain like I'm Pinky
Lil mama going ham on my Dick like bigly wigly
Her boyfriend want to be me
Cause I'm the one she cheat With
Thinking she a virgin
But I fuck her evry weekend
My fuck is on them cheeses
American to Swedish
I dare you talk shit
Before your
The pound on that green tip
From A-town to D-Sip
I stay on the hustle like T.I
So free Tip
Free world, free pimp
Take off, my brim
Moment of Silence for my boy
Dolla Bill
I' back on this track
Like the white chick on Superman
Think I'm dong hair
The way I'm popping these rubberbands
Stackz On Deck standing Taller than a rubberman
Swagg Super Clean
Like a bathtub bubblebath
Fucking with a rat boy
Call him ninja turtle man
Messing with my money
Get jacked up like Urkel's pants
Playboii on the beat
Call me the murder man
Pokemon ice
Pikachu Squirtle man
Reppin' for the cat like
Allison in Wonderland
East Atlanta's own
Six Decater I put on man
 Yeah Goddammit!",https://genius.com/Soulja-boy-outerspace-flow-lyrics
2Milli,Teenage Millionare,2010.0,"I did what I wanted, niggas did what they could
A lion wouldn’t cheat but a Tiger would
I only keep real niggas in my stable
A million dollar chain, I’m feeling like Gucci’s label
So icey I really don’t care
Haters green as a pool table and they twice as square
Had to cut a couple bitches, them niggas need stitches
I’m getting money out the tree y’all niggas getting switches
Similar to Nas, I need a mic though
Chop the bread up, Tae Kwon Do
They pass me the game like Tom Brady
These rappers chances looking slim just like shady

Niggas locked behind my bars Im taking out prisoners
Sit back relax recieving my residual
Think this song is dope sh–t wait til you see the visual
Please brace yourself this shit about to get critical
Let it be known I got rappers on my hit list
I got so many gifts you would swear I stole Christmas
Word to the Grinch bitch
 my style will switch quick
I knew this all along I was waiting just to hit the kill switch
Since day one man your boy been the truth
Broke so many records like I’m in the glass booth
Like I’m in the glass studio breaking out barriers
Back when crime mob was screaming Ellenwood Area
Nigga I ain't scared of ya, never ever will be
I’m screaming I’m the best till these rappers kill me
Make the people feel me like the blind men do
On your girl, head so much, like her favourite shampoo
I’m travelling where I want, soulja’s vacation
My mind is so free, emanicapation proclamation
Im so hot, haters evaporating
6 bitches on my dick I’m elimidating
Im high every friday just like smokey
Im spitting real shit, these niggas spitting Karaoke
Hit stick with the flow just like Madden
Im so high on my carpet feeling like Alladin
I spit hot flames bitch just like a dragon
And my pants saggin
Spell it backwards niggas
Niggas get heated when they see the coupe on
I dont give a fuck got my Pyrex suit on
I’ma keep rapping til the fans hear the best of me
Im cooking up the game bitch yeah I got the recipe
You ain't gotta like me just please respect it
Hip hop is dead nigga let me resurrect it
Microphone check it, uno, dos, tres
I’ma keep spitting til they crown me the best
The rap games a mess, let me clean it up
Its a pigsty they going ham give it up

Flying down the highway a million on the dashboard
You can't start my car up unless you got the password
I’m something like a prophecy spit so properly
When my album drops watch how many rappers copy me
Haters opinions are obsolete
Don’t make pop music so it ain’t no pop in me
And my brains a bitch where she at when I need her
Ya pack nines, I pack nine kilometers
Ya did’nt want beef why would ya start it
Cannons flashing like you walking down the red carpet
First you was nameless now I'mma make you famous
Hit you with the stainless and leave your ass brainless
Best rapper…",https://genius.com/Soulja-boy-2milli-lyrics

Made 20 M's i ran as fast as i could to the trap, then wells fargo
Hop in the rarri', went full throttle
Hit a nigga in a head with a bottle!
Young stylish nigga freshing then aeropostale
Fucking your bitch and you know that she swallow

Hit the pot with the folks
Spread the cocaine just like an egg yolk
Got some niggas died In zone 4
Pull on your block

Soulja !
Unh
Getting to the cake
All these niggas fake
Yea these niggas snakes
These niggas hate
Pull up on they block,First  48
Gripping that heat
Giuseppe's that sit on my feet
Trapping and capping getting money all week
Pussy ass nigga, you know that you weak
Pull on yo block, shoot a nigga in his cheek
Came up from serving, you know it's no flocking
I pull up on yo block and I'm gripping the chopper
I'm getting to the money
I'm getting to the dollars
Man look at yo bitch, she say I'm trending topic
I came up, and you know a nigga got rich
Standing in Zone 1 I'm serving them bricks
Who want beef with me,I'm gripping hollow tips ?
Mac 11 on me make his body flip
Giuseppe karate kick
Hop out the foreign whip , like it's a stolen whip
I'm gripping the .223,came in with hollow tips
Disrespect Soulja,man, we gone shoot some shit
The pistol be popping
Everybody be dropping
In broad day, and I'm Ferragamo when I'm shopping
Disrespect Soulja, you know that my niggas start popping
I smoke with Jamaicans, I hang with the Shallahs
I'm smoking on dope, I feel like a rocket
Fettuccine Alfredo, I'm eating my pasta
Maison Margiela, I'm popping my collar
Faking actor, you deserve a Oscar
I'm feeling like Future, this shit get colossal
Hit a nigga,in the head, with a bottle
Maison Margiela, I hop out the Rarri, I'm popping
Too many hoes,got too many options
Nigga who the fuck, you think that you stopping ?
Aim with the chopper, I know that I got him
Grab the uzi, then a nigga start popping
Hunnid shooters in Atlanta, Hunnid of them Bompton
Mini Mac 11, nigga start bussing
Came up from the bottom, never had nothing
Audemar bust down, gave it to my cousin
City to city, Lil Soulja Boy buzzing
You tried to diss Soulja, but boy you a joke
You lame ass nigga, you know that you broke
I'm balling so hard, like I'm on a coat
My shooters pull up, they hit you with scopes
Tell Trump and Hillary, I didn't vote
In the kitchen, hit the pot with the fork
What the fuck Imma vote for ?
In the trap hit the pot, with my elbow
I iced out my other ear
They need to give Obama 4 more years
I'll kill a nigga, tat one more tear
Broke ass nigga, get the fuck out of here
I'm getting to the money, dope up in the wind
I was gone stop, but now it's time to go in
I'm fucking yo bitch, and yo bitch best friend
And I'm Soulja Tell Em' and I whip up a 10
Sipping on juice, I don't do the Gin
Who is this broke nigga? Who let him in ?
Soulja Tell Em', I pull up with the chopper
Aiming at the motherfucking chin
Chopper hit a nigga straight in the head
Lamborghini, that's a arm and a leg
Disrepect Soulja, boy you know you dead
10,000 put it straight on yo head
I don't give a fuck about none of yo goons
I don't give a fuck about none of yo hoods
Run in yo house with the chopper, we pop
Pull up on yo block,and yo body gone drop
Snatch the gold out yo mothafucking mouth
Shooters they come and they run in ya house
Shout out my shooters they posted down South
I got them niggas, that pull up with triggers, that put the pistol in ya mothafucking mouth

Junkies hit the door, they knock at my door, they leave
And they coming right back like a boomerang
Half a chicken i spent it on my pinky ring
Me and Birdman riding that fire flame
Rich gang lil nigga we savages
Zone 1, I was serving that cocaine
Came in the trap I was serving that Mary Jane
Sixteen hit the pot with the hurricane
Buscemi feet when I stand in the trap
And I'm whipping that dope
And Niggas selling everyting
Sipping ciroc but no im not diddy
Look at the apple watch it cost me a 50
Platinum maserati slide thru the city
Hop out the whip I'm whipping that Whitney

I ride the Lambo like I hit the lotto
I'm smokin' cookies and sellin' gelato
I know that most of these niggas be fake
Pussy ass nigga get hit with the K
I'm gettin' money, the fuck out my face
I walk in the trap and I pour up a eight
I catch a quarter million Bentley truck
Whippin' my wrist in the pot, I don't give a fuck
Wish a nigga well, gotta go double up
Left wrist Rolex, sixty thousand for my shit it's frozen up
Red beam on their head, I'ma hit em up
Drop yo location, nigga let's go get it up
Bust down on a bracelet
Fifty thousand for my jeweler, spent it, I ain't give no fuck
Young Drako nigga, you know I'm real nigga
Young Drako nigga you know I be trappin', my nigga
Young Drako run through the millions
Young Drako stack up money to the ceiling, my nigga
Had to go get a ticket
Most of these niggas be really bitches
Twin-Turbo when I skrrt this shit too the limit
Catch me in the trap, nigga I'm whippin' fishes
Okay, but that's another story, back to this trap shit
In the trenches, put a hundred thousand in my mattress
Fuck with Drako, bitch you know I'm bout action
Make the wrong move, then my nigga start clappin'
You want a pint of drink, you know that I tax you
I'm the CEO of Money Gang, and nigga we blastin'
Hop in the Rari, and skrrt in that Aston
White Maserati, same color as Casper
Jump in the foreign, you know it go faster
A hundred bitches on my P, just like Master
Brand new Rari, man I don't do the masda
Ooh I meant Mazda, ooh I'm eatin' lobsters
Hundred dollar Gucci shirt, I pop collar
Thousand dollar gold bottle, I pop it
Big draco on me, I don't gotta cock it
I put a hundred bricks in helicopters
This shit ain't got no hook, but I'm steady goin'
Stand in that trap, and I'm makin' it storm
Tornado whip my wrist, I fuck up my arm
Two-tone Cuban link, I switch up the charm
I walk in that club, and they ring an alarm
I'm seeing a junkie, I'm servin' the bomb
Giuseppe my toes, I do that for fun
I fuck on yo bitch while I'm grippin' my gun
I'm throwin' blue hundreds, I don't throw the ones
I walk in that club, the strippers like ""ooh, here he come""
Hop out the Rari with hundred round drum
Young Drako nigga, you know where I'm from
Young Drako nigga, came straight out the slums
Young Drako play with the pots, and the bricks, and the bon
I'm in yo bitch mouth, right on her tongue
Nigga want beef, it's filet mignon
I ride in the Rover, I'm mixin' the soda
They call me Young Drako, they call me Young Soulja
Earring right, boulder
Left ring, half quarter
Bust down, new Rollie

Got a fat chopper, shoot it at the crowd nigga
Enough weed on me to pass around nigga
Yeah I'm a Yung Joc cause it's going down nigga
Cops pull me over, I was full of smoke, woah
Ask me if I'm drunk and I said, oh no
I'm from the streets I don't rock with popos
I got my own going if you want smoke

I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

Hit the mall and im switching lanes
A lot of diamonds on my neck like six chains
Baby girl round me and you know that
Everything official i got gucci on my doormat
Jump in the whip then i smash out
We dont talk about the price we just cash out
Me and you we just doin what we do
You know im always thinking bout you
I need your love all to myself
I dont wanna see you with nobody else
She calling my phone tattos all inked up
I pick up the phone and then we link up

Baby girl you know you a dime
You always on my mind
Baby girl you so fine
You know I had to make you mine, had to make you mine

I hate that I love you after all you did to me
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak
But again they say
Thugs dont cry, and Souljas gon' ride
I ain't even thinkin bout you

You ain't a ride or die, you would die to ride
Gave you TLC but then Lisa left I
Thats when our texts fly, arm out the X5
With my S6 showing me the exit
You precious and I ain't desperate
I know realness when i see it
The one I wanna be with
You can take it you can leave
With dreams so big I ain't even gotta sell em
I sit back and let Soulja Boy Tell Em

Baby girl you know you a dime
You always on my mind
Baby girl you so fine
You know I had to make you mine, had to make you mine

Till the wheels fall off and the lights have burnt out
Said I'm riding with you
Till the wheels fall off and the lights have burnt out
But are you riding with me
I can't leave you alone, even though you did me wrong
I think we got, I think we got, thats why

I hate that I love you after all you did to me

Feeling kinda lost cause we dont speak
Trying to be strong but im so weak

And they couldn't find the residence
Got a young nigga feeling like the president (Obama)
Every time I drop these niggas copy me
I swear to god, niggas watching me
I ain't a door so why they knocking me
On everything I love ain't no stopping me

Forgiatos spin like windmills

When the smoke clears a young nigga still here (Swag)

But keep your mouth closed if you talking
Ditch multiple vehicles, bitch, just to match my fitness
And Blast Gang still blasting it

Red and blue diamonds like Mario
Homie bitch chose I ain't want the ho
The world is mine bitch I walk the globe
Haters' access get denied, on the red carpet no quote required (Soulja)
All these rappers make me laugh, looking hella tired

Coped a rollie on my wrist and it was bust down
I hit the city on the block and im like what now
Them niggas high on the block and im like what now
2 hands in the air like i scored a touch down

Disrespectin' of Soulja, know im stacking millions
Nigga talking bout they gettin', they ain't gettin' shit
Broke ass nigga in the block, ain't hittin' list

Break The Bank,Loud,2012.0,"I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)

I’m tryn’ to break the bank fuck you niggas think
Pull up in that Bentley customize the paint
Lean in the sink I’m doing what you can’t
Nigga say they getting money but I know they ain’t
Throw up in the sink, pouring up my drink
Came out the water put that 9 in your face
50 thousand dollars made my lawyer beat the case
It ain’t really nothing shoot that nigga in his face
Bitches love the taste, niggas say your Grace
Grind through the hood Gucci on my shoelace
Bitch I’m outta space money by the case
I ain’t got no suit, but I got a suitcase

I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)

I’m tryin’ to break the bank who really can do it like this
Who really can do it like me in the streets we’re 50 Cents
In the studio with Lil Twist I’m riding around on your bitch
I’m stunting on you bitch you niggas can’t do it like this
I swag since ever since ’07 that’s not on my deal
That was like 5 years, 2012 I’m outta here
2013 my year, I do this with no fear
I look in the hater face and ask what do we have here?
It’s Soulja, it’s Soulja
I’m riding around in Range Rovers
I’m pulling up in Ferarris , I’m yelling diamond shorty
I’m sipping lean and Bacardi remember I’m the shooter of the party
I really don’t go retarded, get me started I go hardest

2019, man you know what it is
Yeah! Uh

Fuck with gang, nigga and I hit the killswitch
Geeking off a Percocets, nigga can't feel shit
Run up on gang, get hit with the whole clip
I hit my show, after that sell a brick

Make the wrong move get filled up with hollow tips
Riding round town in that Limousine stretch whip
Hop out that cut with my finger on trigger finger, pool stick
35 thousand, bust down Rollie wrist
Aye bruh bruh, who the fuck is this?
Word around town I been fucking his bitch
Nigga talking shit, I empty the clip
Brand new Bentley truck, that's my whip
VVS diamond, you should of went to Elliott
That 30 clip long like that nose on an elephant
Do a drive-by in a Lamborghini
Geeked up off of Percocets
I hit the pot with a fork and a strap with that glizzy
I just came back from New York
Run up on Drako, your ass gon get torched
Fucking your bitch, her pussy so moist

Fuck with gang, nigga and I hit the killswitch
Geeking off a Percocets, nigga can't feel shit
Run up on gang, get hit with the whole clip
I hit my show, after that sell a brick

Walk in this bitch with a stick on me
Cuban link, pint of Actavis, with a bad bitch on me
Run up on Drako, I'm leaving you history
A million dollars, that's a lot to you?
But really, that ain't shit to me
I'm double cup sipping Promethazine
Pull up on my block, I'ma spray up the whole street
Fuck that shit, nigga I kill the whole beat
Bust down my Rollie, it look like a centipede
Pull on the block with a Drako, spray heat
I make these rap niggas remember me
Black and yellow diamonds, feeling like Wiz Khalifa
Diamonds a bumblebee
Took off like a rocket, ain't nobody stopping me
Coppin two bricks, and now I'm coppin three
Walk in the Louis store, I'm on a shopping spree
Watch out how many of these rap niggas gon copy me
Diamonds in my mouth, clean it with Listerine
Smoking on dope, playing the Soulja Game
Big Backwood, tasting like Krispy Kreme
Stretched Lambo look just like a Limousine
Big chopper, get to spraying up the whole street
I am Big Soulja, nigga who gon check me?
I spent 30 thousand for my neck piece
I got a condo, it's right on South Beach
No Limit Soulja, I'm feeling like Master P
Back in High school, I had more money than the faculty
And I put that shit on my momma
You run up on Drako, get hit with the thunder
I shoot with the dice and I'm hitting my number
I'm pissing out lean, I need me a plumber

Swing,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, whoa, back it up, now let me see your hips swing
Now drop it low and let me see your hips swing
Down to the floor now let me see your hips swing
Down to the floor now let me see your hips swing
Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips swing, and, look, just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell ""savage where the chorus at?!""

Uh oh, let it pop, ladies drop it like it's hot
Hell yeah, that's the spot, now bring it back to the top
Stop! woah, now back it up, now back it up
Let it rise then watch it dump, shaking your junk in the trunk
And, I, like, the way you move it smoothly
Now why, don't, you move that booty, to, me
I'm tryna come up with some thoughts of attack
Until I heard somebody yellin' out ""savage where the chorus at?!""


Knees bent, ass out, come on push your ass out
(Let me see your hips swing)
Bring it up then back down, bring it up then back down
(Let me see your hips swing)
All my ladies on the floor, all my ladies on the floor

Pick it up then dip it low, pick it up then dip it low

All of these diamonds, I pull them together
Niggas be talking, they don't get no cheddar
We shoot undercover pistols and Beretta
Nigga, I got Louis all on my sweater
VVS diamonds is all in my bezel


Used to live in a bando
Now I run through in them camos
Niggas talkin', they get no money
I be seein' my face through the channels
Gucci, Louis on my sandals
I'm lightin' shit up like a candle
I'm on an island like Gilligan
Slangin' eight balls like I'm Wimbledon
Gucci, Louis on my Timberlands
Ten stacks in my pocket the minimum
Pull up that Wraith, you killin' 'em
Soulja worth 25 million
Oh my god, look at my chain
I'm killin' the pot, they know my name
I'm in the club, and I'm on flame
Giuseppe my feet, it's not a game
Puttin' a fuck nigga to shame
Step out the club and I'm makin' it rain
Thirty thousand on my  ring
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my game

Walk inside Lenox Mall, everybody backed up
Takin' pictures of a prophet because I'm stackin'
Everybody wanna know what the fuck is happenin'
Money going platinum, sold out shows

You ain't even know bout Draco, man my favorite color red

Red bitch, red dot, red Rari, red Lamb
When I walk inside the bank, they be like ""god damn""
In Burberry goin' in
Jacket hit me for three bands
In my Porsche bout to fall asleep, leaning like kickstand
Throwing cash out the coupe
Play with gang and we shoot
I got birds like the zoo
I am blessed like ""atchoo""
I got Fendi on my shoe
12 in the rearview
Nah, I ain't gone pull it over
I'ma skrrt-skrrt-zoom

Had to go get me a check
Had to go run up a bag
Had to go ice out my neck
Had to go ice out my wrist
Damn these niggas so mad
She was suckin' on dick
I guess that the bitch, she wanted a bag
I was whippin' my wrist
Just had ran up a whole lot of cash
Hermes link
Lean, same color Easter egg
Don't run up and play with gang
We gone put one in yo dread
I'ma skrrt the Maserati like Santa on a sled
You ain't even know bout Draco, man my favorite color red

Uzi get to poppin, just like all up in yo pimple
Wearing official designer drip, I'm a Ferragamo stepper
I'm too player for you haters, I caught capers in Las Vegas
She want Hennessy, I got lean on me, I'll see you later
Everyday I count up crazy
Penthouse, skyscraper
Rollie wrist, new Mercedes
New Givenchy for my lady
Beats By Dre, Bluetooth crazy
Lamborghini Huracan crazy
Whip the pot like a baby
VVS diamonds look so crazy

Had to go get me a check
Had to go run up a bag
Had to go ice out my neck
Had to go ice out my wrist

She was suckin' on dick

Do you remember when we used to talk all night ?
That you asking , Will you be my girl ?
But we from two different planets , we come from two different worlds
The very first time that I saw your face

Maybe I can be ya man , you could be my bestfriend
Baby I can be ya man until the very end

I threw thirty racks on my fucking neck

Pick up the pack in an audi like i am iron man
Hop out the coupe with arm, man

It don't matter where you from, long as you stay stuntin
I press a button in my Coupe and watch the car transform
I turn the haters on you, blast my speakers 'til they learn
I spit flames on the mic fryin you bound to get burned
After I finish stuntin then you know it's Mini-Me turn
S.O.D., is the label, on 50 rich the fable
Tryin to stunt like me, but I know that you ain't able
From internets and cable, from my hood to Asia
I hit the stunt button now watch me count my paper
I cain't, hear a hater, I cain't, be one either
Rubbin ice on my ice cause my chain got a fever
Stunt like Evel Knievel, Beanie hat no Sigel
Good over evil, I pull off in a Regal

My style is so different, my flow is prolific
Girls on my tip cause I'm a pro at business
And I don't be limpin, I ain't never been shot
But I will shoot any rapper who, come try to take my spot
My buzz is so hot, I got the internet locked
Ask them wannabe goons who tried to run inside my spot
I hit the stunt button and all of that stopped
In my whip hittin donuts for them hungry ass cops
Is that all that you got? Man my chain is enormous
Shittin on the beat, like the beat is a toilet
I see they tried to ignore it, but they gotta face it
A million dollars cash bitch I spent that on my bracelet

I'm asking mama questions, she giving false answers
I didn't want to leave my hood, I just couldn't stand it
Move to Mississippi and I finally had a family
Move to Mississippi and I finally had a family
My dad, my sister and my newly born brother
The first time I had to call another woman mother
Flair I love ya, I know I didn't show it
My mom asking for money and you asking for nothing
Every day I told ya, one day I'ma make it
And if I never told ya, really appreciate ya
And if I never told ya, I really appreciate ya
And if I never told ya, I really appreciate ya

It's in my soul, I got passion
I won't stop, I can't stop rappin'
Haters blastin' out they mouth
Just 'cause Soulja from the South
But I won't stop, I can't stop, no
I won't stop, I can't stop, dawg
I won't stop, nah, I can't stop, dawg
Ain't gon' stop, dawg, I can't stop, dawg

I got girls claiming I got 'em pregnant (Pregnant)
My life is really hectic (Hectic)
I'm going through the spectrum (Spectrum)
Don't hate it, just respect it (Respect it)
And if you can't respect it then I guess that's too bad (Then I guess that's too bad)
And if my life don't change then I guess that's too sad (Then I guess that's too sad)
With every move I make I make a lot of people mad
But with a lot of moves I make, I make a lot of people glad
Glad, glad yeah, glad, man, I do it from the heart
And if I wasn't gonna finish, why I would I even start?
I'm Soulja Boy Tell 'Em and my life is a movie
But all I gotta say is please free my nigga Gucci
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em my life is a movie
But I got to say is, mane, free my nigga Gucci

It's in my soul, I got passion
I won't stop, I can't stop rappin'

But I won't stop, I can't stop, no

Pound  that’s a beat up, 50 k on my sleeve bro
And I’m fresh fuck and my sleeve up
These niggas riding won’t be us
Everyday we get the bump, riding round smokin’ grind
2012 red Bentley mean, gang driving through compton
Bad bitches by the dozen, no police I ain’t coughing
And niggas saying they got swag
But it’s money gang or nothing
I’m high as fuck see it in my eyes
Shouts out game that number 5
Fresh as fuck till a nigga die
Gonna write my name up in the sky
Fick you niggas talking bout, we get cash by large amounts
I’m fucked up and I’m faded, got a mansion up in Las Vegas

I’m fucked up and I’m faded
I said I’m fucked up and I’m faded
We got peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron, peach sirock syrup ‘tron
Faded, I’m faded, faded
She faded, faded, he faded, faded, we faded
Faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, I’m fucked up",https://genius.com/Soulja-boy-too-faded-lyrics

No Hook 2,UnKnown,2019.0,"Trap out the Demon
Trap out the Hellcat
Walk in the mall and I spend me a hundred racks
That nigga start it, but Soulja Boy finished it
If I go spend it, you know I'ma make it back
Mini Draco on me, you know it'll spray you flat
Poppin' two pills, now I'm feelin' like limitless
Ride in a foreign, I used to ride spinnin less
Poppin' a pill, I feel like I'm Ritalin
I'm fuckin' your bitch, does that solve your mystery?
Young Drako my name, you know I made history
M (Million)  is a lot to you, but it ain't shit to me
Run up on gang, you know I'm leaving you 6 feet
Open the back door, nigga go creep-creep
I'm fuckin' your bitch, you know she a freak-freak
Bands'll make her dance, RiRi
Young Drako my name, I know they remember me
How you acting like you a friend of me?
Cock back the pistol, I shoot at my enemies
When one of these pussy ass rap niggas gonna come finish me?
Smoking on dope, I feel like I'm fishing
VVS plug, I don't fuck with middlemen
Who is this nigga, I never heard of him
Hop in the Lamborghini, then I swerve on them
Smoking on cream, I'm sippin' on purple
Young nigga geeked up, like Urkel
VVS diamond my water, Squirtle
I'm in your bitch, just like a 
 orders
I got them bricks, that ship cross the border
I hit the Mexico, I jump the wall
Living my best life, just like Duval
I got this shit from LA, out of New York
Smell like a pound when I'm up in court
Ballin' so I'm hard, like I'm on a court
Flexin' on these broke niggas like it's a sport
Lambo to , they know who I am
Pop out with Draco, that chopper go blam
Catch me if you can, like Gingerbread Man
Riding 'round town with a hundred and fifty bands
Rollin' up green, gas, Shrek
Pourin' up red, blood, Hi-Tech
Try to finesse me, you know you get wet
Shout out my squad, shout out my set
Try to rob, we leaving a mess
This is not school, so nigga don't test
Cuban the link and it sit on my neck
Back in High School, I was serving that crack
Sippin' on lean, I think I need a doctor
Back in High School, I had M's sittin' in my locker
 you got it
That ain't shit, I got racks in my pocket
Young Drako, nigga took off like a rocket
Young rich nigga, fly as a cockpit
Say he get money, fuckboy stop it
Stack up an M, gettin' money my hobby
Made me an M, they think I'm 'Luminati
Cop a hotel, then nigga run 'round in the lobby
Every time that I drop, they go cop it
Fuckin' your bitch, now she giving me sloppy
Jump out the Demon, I feel like the GOAT
Two-two-three bullets, they hit at your throat
I kept on servin' and trappin', young nigga I'm bold
VVS diamond, my necklace in gold
Stand in the kitchen, that strap with a pole, my elbows
Came a long way from rockin' them shell toes
Young Drako, nigga I was strapped like velcro
Cookin' that crack with my wrist in a circle
 like bow and an arrow
Covered in gold, they callin' me Pharoah

Whip up the dope, and it tasting like cinnamon
Pop a Percocet, I'm feelin' like limitless

Young Drako drip, I don't dress off a mannequin
Shoot with the Draco, it came from Afghanistan
Your bitch, she suck on my dick, she my biggest fan
I got fishes, see the pack in the mufuckin' minivan
Put that stick on your partner then we killin' him
Young Drako numb to this fuck shit, nigga I feelin' him
Young Drako gettin' cash, money, and dividends
Rich Gang, young nigga, I been the man
Pyrex pot whip my 360 like 
 in my mansion, need a helicopter man
Slide back on your block with that chopper
Yeah I'm sippin' on lean like I came from the doctor man
My chopper start singin' like it's in a Oprah man
My diamonds be wetter than mufuckin' Aquaman
Pull up on the block with a Draco, it choppin' him
Drako not a door, so nigga stop knockin' him
Reach for my chain then you know that I'm poppin' him
I jump in the McLaren, ain't a thing stoppin' him
Walk in that trap house, them bricks, I'm coppin' them
Come to the Soulja Mansion and go take a swim
I remember Dill Avenue, gettin' it in
Ran from police with Tonio, my best friend
Extended Glizzy, 30, and a FNN
Hit him with Draco, he won't see again
Jump in Bugatti, I'm gone in the wind
Cop me a Rollie and whip up my bitch a new Benz
She don't let me hit, then I'm fuckin' her friends
I'm pouring up juice and I'm pouring out Gin
Diss me in a song, but he won't do that again
Up on they block, 360, watch me spin",https://genius.com/Soulja-boy-red-rum-lyrics

Codeine Cold,25 The Movie,2015.0,"I hop on the jet and fly

Big diamonds you know that they froze
I like my Codeine cold
Hop in the jet and fly
Up in the clouds so high
My diamonds they cold, so froze
I like my Codeine cold

I like my Codeine cold
Hop in my Phantom, then roll
I get 100 thousand for a walkthrough, 50k for a show
100 thousand for a promo
Reppin' this shit like I'm OVO
Hop out that wrist and they looking like at diamonds
All in my  look like a Cheerio
Oh no, 100 thousand in one day
100 thousand in your face
Audamars with Piguet
Had to go tell 'em
Niggas be stealing my swag
I'm might go  a new Jag
I'ma just raising a flag
Money it come in a bag

I hop on the jet and fly
In the air so high
Big diamonds you know that they froze
I like my Codeine cold
Hop in the jet and fly
Up in the clouds I'm high
My diamonds they cold, so froze
I like my Codeine cold

I like my car foreign, I'm rocking Jordans
Balenciaga's,  afford 'em
Hop in the Rari its gorgeous
Money like Wheel of Fortune
And you know I'm scorching
Mazi I'm torching
I'm in the Olympics, and I'm steady balling
Just pass me the torch, I'ma flood like the water
The money it 
You know  and keep the hundred round drum
Hop in the 'Rari and slide
I'm telling my Uber where to drive
In the back seat I get high
On the private jet I fly
Look at inside of my eyes
All that you see is dollar signs
All that I'm getting is money now
Niggas hating, they can't see me
Diamonds, they shining like Pee Wee
Money come in like re-re
Diamonds they  in 3D
Look at my face on the TV
Two bitches like Stevie
Money come in like Michael J
Getting the money like every day
Hop in my 'Rari and rollerskate
Money come in, you know that they hate
I'm real and you know that they fake
The diamonds is up on the lake
I put the money in safes
Meet me at the safe house
Versace at the stakeout
Thirty thousand bring the  out
I hop out the 'Rari, it's a race now
Niggas talking like they getting money
Man, they fake out
I been getting money
Back it up, like in a Wraith now
I'm like I'm in a race now

Sitting in a mansion and I'm watching shottas
White Bentley, white diamonds with the gold bottles
In that foreign whip going full throttle
Turned the traphouse into millions of dollars
Christian Louboutins and Balenciagas


Go crazy in the coupe that's 2015

Hundred bands ain't shit to a rich nigga
In a rarri and I still got your bitch with me
Smashing your ho and I pass her to Flippa

30 minutes, one city, my concert, it sold out


Bust that dome
Mother fucker better cut that cord
Stank ass broke
Yall can't cope
Every time we come through, you niggas know our shit dope
When it write off my niggas know my shit flow
Despite the questions, bitch I got all the answers
Let me come and smack all you little niggas that don't have no manners
Boss said so, everybody know I must get dough
And I only fuck with boss bitches, fuck that ho
You know when I roll up in the spot with the snap back low
In Vegas laying down that ace, king, Black Jack ho
Yall niggas see me in the counting moneybetter shut that door
I hope you weight watching my bread nigga fuck that flow

Girl, you making the maximum
And you trying to get racks
You see yo ex dude still like you and that's why dudes still trying to fight you
Wife still in this bitch, tellem' hah, bro you mad
These niggas watching like police tell em show that badge
Work that shit

Crush that ice
Make it snow
I can't be mad
Fuck that flow

If you got that 40 then you better kill me
Push to start drop Bentley I'm on 85
Too much drip for a verse I need 85
Treat my bitch like this designer im a fold her

Brand new chain like a snow cone

Pull up in a Porsche, I'm like, ""Ooh"", baby, who is you?

My savages they crazy, shot a nigga just the other day
And I get money I wouldn't have it any other way
I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
I went and bought a brand new Porsche just the other day

Hey yea
Yeah you know I’m getting cake

And these niggers so fake

I popped a zan and I forgot what happen yesterday
My niggas in the streets they shot 'em just the other day
I’m getting money I wouldn't have it any other way

Hop in the Bentley then splash  my cash

Zu attackieren mit Soulja auf einem Paperchase-Trip
Paar Euros abkassieren

Ich bin nicht so doof wie ihr dachtet ein halbes Jahr warten
Und dann da wird der Hit auf dem Highscore
Ich hab noch was mit meiner Zeit vor, ich will einen Sechstürer

Überlege nach jedem Videodreh was sind jetzt deine größten Geldbringer

Begrab mich in einem Sarg aus Gold, denn ich bin auf meine Taten stolz
Vor mir, ihr prellt jeden Tag aufs Volk
Mit Dreck, irgendwann ist das Maß auch voll
Mann, wir sind SOD-Boys, hype shit, OG OD boys
Doch ihr seid fake während mein Team bei mir nur auf Repeat läuft
Weil alles was ich mache auch die erwarteten Punkte in meinem Vertag deckt
Sag ich jeden Tag ""Swag"", flieg mit der Gang nach Brasilien in 'nem Privatjet
Doch gerade chille ich auf dem Parkdeck und sitze im Tourbus
Schreibe 'ne Strophe, probe sie ein und smoke dabei auf dem Tourbusflur Kush

Piguet Puddle (Tyga Diss),UnKnown,2019.0,"Spent 500 on some Saint Laurent
Walk in the club, like I gotta get this money
Oh, I be just drippin' Balenciaga
It's a puddle, so much money like a puzzle
I remember I was looking like a slave
Working so hard, praying for the days
Police locked me up, you should of seen my face
Gave my lawyer 50k yesterday
I pray to God I beat the case
2019 Daytona, like a race
Niggas on Instagram, but don't say it to my face
I cannot wait, put his body in a lake
I found out all of these niggas was fake
I fucked his baby momma yesterday
His son asking me what's my favorite game
Ain't got time for the Fortnite, I'm running up some M&M's
Whippin' that dope, tryna bring back a 10
Who is Tyga? I ain't never heard of him
Hop in the kitchen, my wrist spin
Young Drako going 10 for 10
Went number one before, I'll do it again
Nominated for a Grammy, I did it
A thousand dollars for Louis Vuitton kicks
I count up the racks, this shit get to my head
Hop in that Lamb, that's an arm and a leg
Count up a check when I hop out the bed
Everyone saying your life's a mistake
I'ma go cop the Audemars Piguet
My diamonds, like Santa on sleigh
Fell in love with the bitch's head
Red on my bandanna, Judge Dredd
Tick-tick-boom, a grenade
They had me locked down in a cage
Had to make bail so they see my face
If I go to hell, shoot Devil in face
I'm sippin' lean, fell in love with the taste
Before I eat his plate, I say my Grace
I'll wipe your nose then tap my face
Kick in a door, with an AK

No instruments
Yaw read no nigga
Cash everywhere
Sushi, truck
Forty million salary
Just like the NBA
All white every day
Like I’m in the KKK
Came with the door
With no instruments
I’m swimming
Young Soulja Boy
Gives a fuck
I keep it pimping
Hate on me
Chewing at my enemies
Right down ocean drive
And Agoff is with me
Sinter is empty
Looking like I’m on him
Everywhere I go
Splash cash like I want it
Fuck what you heard
On my turf
That’s the west side
Cause I came out the ground
Just like the oil
Niggas don’t want
Their motherfucking thermo
Five hit your never list
Tell the hoes we’re spending click
Ocean Gang
Twenty twelve I’m splash
What the fuck you heard?
Came with the cash bro
Money on my chain bro
Easy
Everywhere is easy
Yeller diming busy
Make that shit look easy
I’ll freeze it
I’m frozen
Third eye open
Came with the forty clip
Like I post her
Oh your sister wants my face
On the poster
I swag on my shoulder
They case is
You’re gone nigga
Rustling, hustling, grinding, jogging
Working, working, moving, cooking
Plug it, plug it
It’s nothing, it’s nothing
I love it, I love it
Love it, I love it

This is no instrument
Came out the water with that fifty clip
Soulja I told you
Fifty stars, American flag
..., I came here
Alien on my pants tip

Ain’t even planning
Ain’t even playing
All that I know
Twenty twelve we going to make it
Rubber band wrist
Just made it
Soulja, Soulja, jogging, jogging
Working, hustling, moving, moving
Grinding, grinding
Shots out to Agoff
What’s all the keeve
This is no instrument
Agoff ain’t got to prove shit
I hustle hard
I don’t got to talk about the money
Cause I got it boy
Five star general
Ocean Gang
Got the money niggas
Can’t fuck with
Now I’m on some harder shit
Cali life, live it
Hustle everyday
Do this shit
Bitch is pimping
Man I’m from a hole
Another motherfucking dimension
Came out the water
And I don’t even got a mansion
Bitches on my dick and shit
I don’t give a fuck them nigga
Talking heat and leaks and shit
Bitch I’m still positive
Ride alright until the end
Hustler hustling, jogging, jogging
Working, working, moving, moving
Soulja, Agoff, Soulja, Ocean

By the lake hallows
Still penetrate
Don’t make me demonstrate

Where you lay

Don’t want a nigga to cook
The play saw

Just like a horse shoe

Just like forty two

Riding round with fifty
On my neck
List a golden one
Holler, holler
Pimp pop his collar

Takin' a trip out to North Dakota
Got the bricks in a Range Rover

Young Boss Music,Death Note,2010.0,"Yes...
Wake up in the morning 20 million in a safe
Bank account pulled up  estates
Lobster and a steak man I'm living by the lake
And I know a lot of love, and I know a few hate
But let me demonstrate, the skills of my character
And demonstrate a beast on the wall intellectual
Man on my schedule a whole lot of money-getting
So I hustle hard everyday and it's evident I'm relevant
I'm Soulja Tell'Em man I kill'em quick
I hit the microphone and I make a lot of sense
I spit a lot of skills I got the skills to pay the bills
I got the skills to make mills and let me tell you how I feel
Man I swear that I feel greater, giving thanks to all my haters
And then I say a prayer and then I get back to this paper
And honour to our father, and honour to my mother
My person who is not here, is Soulja Tell'Em my brother, except…

Say to me, I'll say to you
Won't you believe in me, like I believe in you
After all the things, you put me through
Won't you believe in me, like I believe in you

If I only knew, if I only knew? If I only knew
Back then if I only had a couple clues
On the news, checking out who's who
The rich people in America, who are you?
What ya got, how much ya got, where ya live?
How much about, how much about?
Look, my bank is thick so my flow is too sick
I hit the block with a whole lot of fucking chips
I got more chips than a casino
My paper stack tall like Pringles
I'm classic like Al Pacino
Scarface and mandingle, your girl love it
In my house, wherever, in fucking public
It's nothing of it, I'm hot like I'm fresh out the oven
And I look better wherever I'm up
It's Young Beezy man I really gives no fuck
I terminate each track and it's no luck


Wealth, riches, what does this mean?
Living your dreams, or living someone else's?
Word around town man I really can't help it
This is an honour to express my blessings
And this here is a strong song, and the weak can listen
Take what I'm saying man I swear I'm not tripping

Real nigga shit, putting that on my mission
A young nigga that's stacking money everyday up out his digits

I told that K off with my hip that shit gon' rip your family will dip
In the crew, nah nigga we don't know you

That brand new mixtape gon' make them haters fix they face quick
Put a hundred million on my bracelet and I done scraped off in the grey whip
In a grey whip, about eight clips, gon' be a long trip getting paid
Young Dre that be my name and I go hard like everyday, real shit
Last crown, nigga last crown, nigga back down, in my town

Made it to reality, no more technicalities
K hit your face and that shit will make a tragedy

We gon' go so hard, call me butter and clever
Call me smarter than ever I see, some people know it

Some people choose to ignore it but some people gotta face it

Is she in love with me
Or in love with me lifestyle?
Got a bad bitch that drive me crazy

If I go an spend it, you know that I'm gon' make it back
Drop top Phantom, me & Stunna, that's back to back

Yall people never have heard of me
Hit them blocks on them 23s
24s when I go and hit the show
Riding clean on boats and you already know
Soulja Boy hit the spot make them bad girls scream
Hit the scene playing slot machines
When I hit the spot in a limousine
On 23s paint candy green and color spreem
Double D thousand hop like a trampoline
Hit the scene and looking clean with my team or with my queen
Already know how I do rock candy red or candy blue
Gettin money I thought you knew
Stand real and stand true
Take a ride in the Cadillac candy black with the seat back
Look at your hair blow in the wind look shawty don't you like that? Take a trip over seas ride clean on double D
Take a ride with Soulja Boy it'll be something you won't believe

Smoking chronic, I gotta roll hard like my first name Sonic
I'ma boss, I'ma fiend to the fuckin dead presidents
The IRS looking for me, for my residents
Sucked the time after time, they lied on my name
Spreading rumors about me in this hip hop game
But it's all good cause I put them tame after tame
They can't tame me, so they brainwash the public
So I had to do it like nobody else does it
And I had to leave the scene so they saying who was it
It was me, it was Beezy
I made the shit look easy
Yellow diamond watch, yeah that shit is so freezy
Shoutouts to my fans, they know I be throwing bands
When I'm standing on the stage and they standing in the stands
Man I ball hard, yeah I go hard
Still on the deck, I pull the check
I pull the check out, man I rest out
Man I cash out, man I break out
Man I mess out, take the gas out
Take the K out, I'm gone take off on the haters
Talking down on me, but I rose up like elevators
At the same time my mind was on money
I couldn't stop
So I had to get full throttle, headed to the guap

IGot, money in my pocket
IGot, girls scream my name

Moving and I'm pearlinin and I'm pullin

And I know these kids is influenced by this stuff they hear on the radio, deadly faces
I'm on vacation, I'm a movie
I need a standing ovation
My name is little Soulja, I can tell you two times to get yo money and shine because one day you gone die
I'm puttin this shit on the map
And if they keep swagger jacking man I promise I'ma snap
But I'm on back to the basics, I swear I'm back to the nation
I give back to the people, I swear everyone equal and all

I Pray (Outro),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I can't quote the Bible
I skipped Sunday school
And I can't count the times I fell, and broke the golden rule
So I don't know if he listens
Sometimes I wonder if he cares
But maybe I'm just wishin'
'Cause I can't even prove he's there
(chorus)
But I pray
He'll watch over my children
I Pray
Just to be a better man
To find the strength to rise above
To be there for the ones I love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day
I pray
I confess that I don't bow my head as often as I should
Mostly just when times are bad, rarely when they're good
And I don't hold with too much preachin'
But I was raised up to believe
That a man can't ever stand as tall
As when he gets down on his knees
(2nd Chorus)
So I pray
For a world that's gone half crazy
I pray
For every woman, child and man
To find the strength to rise above
To teach each other how to love
To forgive and be forgiven some sweet day

Turned up till the windows jacked
