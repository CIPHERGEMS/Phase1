Are You Ready For Freddy,Coming Back Hard Again,UnKnown,"Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, Freddy -- Freddy!
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, Freddy -- Freddy!
Freddy:
Freddy Krueger's the name
You know my game
Elm Street's the place
You got the time
Listen to this
You'll bust a rhyme
Fat Boys:
Fred Krueger the myth
Or Fred Krueger the man
Doesn't matter cause I'm still
Rapping bout him understand?
So sit back Jack, I'm gonna bust a rhyme
Grab a hold of your friends, it's Krueger time!
Freddy:
It's time for Freddy
See I'm a popular guy
If you don't know yet
You're gonna find out why
Fat Boys:
Well the place was Elm Street
Late one night
It lookin' like a ghost town
No one in sight
With a hat like a vagabond
Standing like a flasher
Mr. Big Time
Fred Krueger, dream crasher
Trying to find a girl to fit his fancy
Not once, not twice
But three times, Nancy!
All the people sleeping, snoozing and dreaming
While Krueger's on the corner of Elm Street scheming
Ha they better wake up and listen to this
Because the blades on Freddy Krueger's hands don't miss!
Nancy: D-d-d-don't fall asleep (asleep)
Chorus 1:
It's 1 AM, and Freddy's here, the supreme dream maker
The ""Master of Fear""
When you see night coming, stay away from the dark
Watch out for, Freddy, he'll bust your heart
It's 2 AM, and Freddy's here, the supreme dream maker
The ""Master of Fear""
When you see night coming, stay away from the dark
(Nancy: Fred Krueger, Mom. Fred Krueger!)
Watch out for, Freddy, he'll bust your heart
Freddy: I'm here...
Fat Boys:
Even if our dreams or dream warriors fail
And Mr. Big Time, Freddy Krueger prevails
It was just prime time, I know you'll never forget
What he did to the girl with the TV set
But you can't stop Freddy cuz he's cool as ice
Comes right back at ya to slash and slice
Like a Ginsu blade, like a blender, he'll blitz ya
Fred Krueger's putting on a ritz
Chorus 2:
It's 3 AM, and Freddy's here, the supreme dream maker
The ""Master of Fear""
When you see night coming, stay away from the dark
Watch out for, Freddy, he'll bust your heart
It's 3 AM, and Freddy's here, the supreme dream maker
The ""Master of Fear""
When you see night coming, stay away from the dark
Watch out for, Freddy, he'll bust your heart
Freddy: Thrillin'!
Young ones, old ones, yo mamas too
And if you don't watch out, I'm gonna thrill you too
So my advice to you is to... stay ready
'Cause you know who's back? Freddy!
You see my name is Freddy and I'm here to say
I'll wrap you up and take you all away!
So if you feel like your tired and ready for bed
Don't fall asleep or you'll wake up dead!
Chorus 2:
It's 3 AM, and Freddy's here, the supreme dream maker
The ""Master of Fear""
When you see night coming, stay away from the dark
Watch out for, Freddy, he'll bust your heart
It's 3 AM, and Freddy's here, the supreme dream maker
The ""Master of Fear""
When you see night coming, stay away from the dark
Watch out for, Freddy, he'll bust your heart",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-are-you-ready-for-freddy-lyrics
The Twist,Coming Back Hard Again,UnKnown,"Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee, Twist
Aah, we're back
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this
The party was packed, I'm talkin' back to back
There was a rapper that was rappin' to a beat that was wack
They was going through the motions out on the dance floor
An' when the rapper was done they wasn't yellin' encore
The people were tired of the same old groove
They wanted something def, something new and improved
Something easy to do but hard to resist
I got something for y'all, what do you call it? The Twist!
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take us by our little hands and go like this
We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks
Came up with The Twist and we were scratchin' the track
People started jammin' hard to the funky sound
Did The Twist down and up, then up and down
Then I heard somebody yell: ""Yo Chubby's here""
The people took a little pause just to stop and stare
He said: ""I'll show you people how to Twist with style
'Cause I've been doin' The Twist for a long long while""
Oh you should see Prince Markie Dee
Check out that Kool Rock is rockin' like me
Here comes B-Beat Box, come on, do it Buffy
Com' com' com' come on baby
Com' com' com' com' come on baby
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chub and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and do The Twist
Chubby took my sister down to the dance floor
Did The Twist so def, the crowd yelled for more
So I pulled it with my mussle, did my flow with my coil
And when Buff did the Limbo we was rockin' the world
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and go like this
Hey hey, England, do The Twist, Twist
And France, do The Twist, Twist
Ha ha ha, Holland, do The Twist, Twist
And Germany, do The Twist, Twist
And all over Europe, do The Twist, Twist, do The Twist, Twist
(Ha ha ha ha) come on baby
(Twist to the left, Twist to the right) let's do The Twist
(Twist up and down, Twist all night)
Chubby Checker (come on, come on) and the Fat Boys
(Come on, come on, come on, come on) we're doin' The Twist
(Come on, come on, come on) take us by our little hands
And go like this
Oh yeah, and do The Twist
Yeah, just like me
Ooh yeah, and do The Twist
Oh yeah",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-the-twist-lyrics

Jumped in a limousine ready to wipe out
Now we're ready to go
Here we go here we go
One one two one two one two hit it D
Here we go
We got to California I said headed for the beach
There were girls galore all within our reach
There was sand and sun and lots of fun
But when we get there the fun really begun
So we cut on the box and started to shout
It was the Beach Boys rocking huh huh the ""Wipe Out""

Word up
Yo, so we wanna tell all the homeboys out there that this is a message coming from The Fat boys
You know what I'm sayin'? And it goes like this:

Now, there's somethin' real old, but still hot news
Been around since Lincoln, but out of view
You stuff it in your wallet so your mom can't see
It's called a condom, baby - And you better believe
It ain't under the shelf now it's on display
With all these diseases going around today
You need a piece of mind when you do the wild thing
So, a condom, brotha' - Don't forget to bring

Protect yourself

Protect yourself
Get busy
Protect yourself
Markie Dee, can you get funky one time
Now, check this out. Listen to me real clear, now:

Now, if what I say sounds a little bit sleazy
If using a condom makes you feel kinda queasy
Don't take it too hard, 'cuz there's no doubt
That modern diseases can take you out
So, don't be ashamed - take one when you go dancin'
And use the condom for a little romancin'
'Cuz being safe don't mean you're weak
And you won't find yourself up the creek

Protect yourself

Homeboy!
Protect yourself - My man, if I was you I'd...

We're a real good team on the football field
And if my nuts have trouble...
Yo, he gets ill!

All around the block?
Took no short cuts - Ran all the way home
Busted down the door
And my nuts were draggin' all over the floor
Now, don't go thinkin' my nuts are sore
They got my back when I go off
They're in my corner when times are rough
And if you're in a jam, I'll let you hold...

Making Noise,Crushin’,1987,"Intro:

Answer me one question: Can you serve any MC?

No!!!

1987, Markie Dee and Kool Rock - get'n busy

Prince of rap rhymin' - Any title I'll snatch
When I'm through with your crew, bring a brand new batch
Line 'em up and then the termination starts
Step aside if you're a sucka' that has no heart
'Cuz I go to a party just to rap and dance
When I'm done, I play the  and strike the B-boy stance
Have my tool at my side for those I don't trust
And when the party gets boring, I call it a bust
'Cuz I'm the prince of   and serving fear
Got a punch that'll knock ya' into next year
Gotta rhyme it when I say it - I'm sure you'll agree
That the prince of rap rhymin' is Markie Dee
So, bust that
Get'n funky
In the place get'n busy
B-r-rip...Bust it! B-r-r-r-ust it!

The power-lord of rap is about to speak
So, hail to the words of the mighty chief
And all duck MCs who thought I was soft:

Step back while the mighty Kool Rock goes off

Stimulatin', motivatin' with the rappin' skill
I can never be beaten; that's the way I feel
Try to take what's mine, you will be slain
My job is to rap and that's my claim

So,    he's the best you heard

I can speak with soft or duelin' words
I can act like a sucka', a punk, or a duck
Or I can act real hard and just rough you up
There ain't no tellin' what I'm gonna do next
So, don't you wink or even flex
Just glide with the rhythm and flow with the beat
And watch the Rock get busy on the m-i-c
Word!

Get'n funky - in the place!

Word!

Well, I...Well...B-r-rip-dip

Well, I climbed the highest mountain, swam the deepest sea
And I've yet to find a rapper that can deal with me
But, my position is  prince of rap rhymin'
Bustin' A's in skill, ability and timin'
Finesse and grace, with talent and poise
And ya' know, when at a party, Markie Dee makes noise
I'm a well-known rapper; B-boy style poet
And if ya' didn't know, then I'm lettin' you know it!
I'm droppin' MCs - Cold knockin' 'em out
And you'll never go the distance in a one-round bout
See, I recite a funky lyric - A rapper, I boast
I put eggs and bacon, and eat 'em like toast!
Perpetratin'   to use the name ""Prince""
You're a duck and a sucka' without any sense
'Cuz the prince of rap rhymin' - Who else could it be?
But, me...Mark...Markie...Markie Dee

Word!

In the place to be

But, uh...Well, I...Well, I

B-r-r...b-r-rip...Bust it!

Well, I'm a highly intellectual rhyme reciter
A verbally speakin' hip-hop professor
A super entertainer and original rhyme writer
My name is Kool Rock and I'm a lover, not a fighter
The top-o-the heap at the fullest peak
Gettin' stronger and stronger while the rest get weak
So, you better call the army    

'Cuz Kool Rock-ski is on a rap rampage!

The darkest MC you ever saw
Got gold on my neck and rhymes galore
Got the power of a  and I can't be stopped
I'm a MC dream and the cream-o-the crop
Bust that!
Word!

In the place get'n busy

Know what I'm sayin'?

Baby You’re a Rich Man,Disorderlies (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),1987,"How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far
Far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
How often have you been there
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do

Fat Boys,Fat Boys,1984,"Fat (fat, fat) Boys

Now, we may be a little chubby, but don't feel slump
We guarantee ya' one thing; we can surely come
To the party, and rock the house
As we harmonize, and start to turn it out
So bust a fresh move, and take it from me
Listen to the fresh sound of the 
Disco Three
Ha, ha!


Prince Markie Dee (Kool Rock-Ski)
The Human Beat Box providing the beat
One-thousand pounds put all together
The disco brothers to last forever
And as we enter the room, you know the crowd starts waking
The crowd starts breaking
And my voice starts shaking to the funky rhythm
Of a beat so fast
To bust a fresh move to the rhythm of rap, Markie Dee

Now I'm Markie Dee, but you can call me the prince
And I have a slight problem
That I couldn't solve since I'm overtired
See I over ate
At a steady pace rate
Yeah I'm overweight
But it ain't no thing
Cause I'm always fresh
And guaranteed to pass any emcee contest
Like M&M candy will melt in your hand
So be a real live lover in where I stand
Now to some it might be funny
And some sort of boring
But listen to the words as I tell my story
Now it started out when I was very small
I devoured chocolate cake, plates, candles and all
For breakfast, it was teaser five pounds of bacon
And halfway through by stomach started shakin'
Toast on the side five gallons of juice
And that was just for breakfast when I start to get loose

Fat Boys
You know they're down by law
Fat Boys
They givin' you much, much more

Now my name is Kool Rock
Last part is Ski
And I am the captain rocker of the Disco Three
You see I get pizzaz, style, and grace
Just one slight problem; I'm a little overweight
But my walk is funky
My golden pop
Every time I touch a girl, they always yell stop
Because I'm down by law
I'm the king of the 
slop
But I know one thing my heart keeps inside
Says do the right thing and you will survive
People still put me down 'cause I'm the rest of the town
But I got one thing that's hard to beat by
I got class, yes; that's right, ladies
I'm a little overweight but
I'll pass, huh
I'm like glass
Yes I'm easy to break and if you get me wrong
Thats a chance to take
Yes my word is bond
And that's no mistake
Yes, you've heard my words
And that's my rap
So party people lock on to the beat called fat
The beat called fat will rock the spot
So party people rock on
To The Human Beat Box


To all the ladies in the place
I'm the prince of ease
And you have to scream please
If I'm on the freeze
Go below zero or steamin' hot
'Cause if you mess with the Prince, you're sure to get shot
'Cause I'm a ladies' man, a number one choice
Nominated five times for my platinum voice
Five foot eight, I got hazel eyes
And if you think I'm soft, you're in for a surprise
'Cause I'm hard as a rock and my name ain't Tom
Trying to battle me is like defusing a bomb
The red wire, the orange, the purple and blue
One emcee ain't enough, you're gonna need two
To beat me, so here's your chance
Get in your stance, make a little romance
Smoking things from plants
Taking pictures, I'm not a freelance, baby doll
Dominating emcee
And when I'm on the stage the ladies scream for me
We're fat We're fat
We can never be wack
And if you go for that
Then we'll be back",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-fat-boys-lyrics

Jail House Rap,Fat Boys,1984,"In jail, in jail
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

Now there was just one day that I will never forget
I got jailed for something that I'll always regret
It was twelve o'clock, midnight and I wanted a snack
So I headed downstairs, thought the fridge was packed
But when I opened the door, what did I see?
The back of the fridge staring right at me
I thought to myself I could almost die
Then an image appeared, a pizza pie
So I put on Adidas, headed out the door
As I pictured myself eating more and more
But the store was closed, I busted into a rage
So I went to the crib and got my twelve-gauge
Ran back to the shop, busted won the door
And all I saw was pizza galore
So I stuffed my face, I couldn't even walk
I couldn't laugh, smile, shake, giggle, wiggle, or talk
So I fell asleep with my face in my plate
And the next thing you know, I was headed upstate

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

Well, Kool Rock is my name, last part is ""-Ski""
And I have the worst case of any MC
But listen to the story cause it's kind of strange
When I had this sort of hunger pain
Walking down the street with the bass of my box
With my stomach growling like a hungry fox
When I saw this scene or was it a dream?
A big restaurant sign called Burger King
So I went inside, started stuffing my face
Didn't even think about the things I ate
But when the bill came up, boy, was I shocked
I said, ""I don't pay for nothing, I'm the King of the Slops!""

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

But when our time is through, we'll rock you and you
We turn parties out, make you scream and shout
We're not demanding or very outstanding
We got something unique and in the middle he's standing
On the microphone, he rocks and shocks
Homeboys and girls, it's the Human Beat Box


Now I'm sitting here alone looking at the wall
Just thinking about how I took the fall
I thought I was cool, I thought I was slick
And now I'm writing letters of being homesick
I lost my freedom when I heard the door slammer
And now I'm breaking rocks with a big, heavy hammer
I used to drive the streets with my big car
And now I look and all I see are bars
(In jail) Everyone's the same
You only survive if you play the game
You don't have knives, you don't have guns
And now you remember you're your momma's son
You made her cry and stay up all night
Coming home high, just leaving a fight
You always made her feel that you were better
But now you're a little boy just waiting for a letter

In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-jail-house-rap-lyrics

(C'mon!) Please... I'm asking you, KB
Ready?
 Yeah, ready?
Fat Boys!

Brrr, Stick 'em!

When fresh beats and rhymes collide
The result is a hop and the Fat Boys 'bout to get ready for this
We keep it up, no slack
You guessed it: the Fat Boys are back

With Prince

And Kool Rock

And The Human Beat Box one time in your mind

Amazing to the eye, devastating to the ear
And if you've never seen him, you'll wonder where
His beats come from: machine or man?
He's also cutting up cause he's in command

Now, my name is Markie Dee and I'm on the go
And due to miscalculations, I'ma let you know
That I'm the prince of rap, the king of hip-hop
And when my mouth starts to moving, I will not stop
Cause I'm all the way live, with so much juice
So check out the Prince as I start to get loose
Capital P, bad as can be, can't no other MC mess with me
Because I travel to places where MCs are mean
Where their eyes turn red and their tongues turn green
Some of them fat and some quite lean
But they all step back when I'm on the scene
Because I make 'em, break 'em, wake up, or shake 'em
Slap icing on the top and sure enough bake 'em
'Bout to grease the pan, I got the juice the girls
That five-foot-eight with natural curls
And Kool Rock, Kool Rock-Ski, I heard you're in the place to be

Kool Rock-Ski, as you can see
Master of disaster, the chief of the East
And when I'm on the mic I'm making ninja vibes
Hip-hop often, I'm qualified
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Bolder than bad, I'm badder than bold
I'm on the microphone, take complete control
With The Human Beat Box on the side of me
Guaranteed to rock the rhythm, make you move your feet
I'm like that, y'all, I'm like this, y'all
And when I fire my revolver I never miss

Fat Boys!",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-stick-em-lyrics

Don’t You Dog Me,Fat Boys,1984,"Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me

We're the Fat Boys you can see are our name
So don't put our kindness and respect to shame
Treat us like you would want to be treated
Put our kindness in use and make it be needed
A lot of people take advantage of the 3
Because they think we're another bunch of sucker MCs
Talk behind our backs, say a bunch of bull
But the Fat Boys got a lot of pull, so...

Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me

Now baby listen to what I have to say
And if you don't want to, I'll say it anyway
Now I once had a lady, she was so fly
She was my girl and I was her guy
Now I loved that girl with all my heart
But little by little she would tear it apart
I'm talking ten dollars here, a hundred there
She wasn't ashamed, she'd ask me anywhere
She was one of those girls who didn't give a hoot
And tore my heart from the vine, stem, and root
Then I met you and you met me
And you're the brand new Ms. Markie Dee
And all I ask is that you treat me right
Through every lasting day and night
And I'll give you what you want
And in the right way
And there's one more thing I have to say

Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me
Don't you dog me

Simon, , and George wanna get my girl
And if I had enough money I'd buy her the world
Take her for a ride in my white limousine
And treat her like a queen on an empire scene
Give her anything that she want
And if she want good lovin' I won't front
Because my love is stronger than the guys at pound
So don't take me for granted and put me down
'Cause I'm Kool Rock-Ski the dominating MC
Master of Disaster, the Chief of the East
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I'm the MC with the fresh rhymes
And when I'm on stage and ladies scream for me
'Cause I'm the capital K known as Kool Rock-Ski
Better than best, I'm MC successor
When I'm on the mic I cause a disaster - Go!

Don't you dog me
(beatbox)
Don't you dog me
(You know I love you-u)
Don't you dog me
(Because I'm in love with you)
Don't you dog me
(Hey girl say you want be my girl)
Don't you dog me
(You look so sweet)
Don't you dog me
(And I love you)
Don't you dog me

Can You Feel It?,Fat Boys,1984,"Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can...
Can you f...

Now you're coolin' at a dance standin' on the wall
But it's time to get steady and on the ball
Grab up a girl and get on the floor
And listen to Markie Dee's rhymes galore
Because the music is fresh, so darn funky
The highs are crisp and the bass is chunky
And the final ingredient, the movement of the feet
A complete street meet, a funky fresh treat
The jam is halfway through, you sit down for a while
A young lady approaches with a very big smile
She wants to dance, but your feet are sore
But later for that, you go and dance some more
You do the hustle, bus stop, and even the samba
You make up a dance called the islands of ramba
Yes on the dance floor, you're throwin' a fit
And that is a result when you, feel it!
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Can you feel the rhythm of the funky bass?
Well it's kickin' it live in your face
The homeboys in the place are holdin' up the wall
While the girls are on the floor, giving their all
The man that's on the mic rappin' to a fresh beat
Is none other than the money-makin' Kool Rock Ski
The MC powerlord of the minion emcees
With the funky fresh rap that'll get you out your seat
So tell me can you feel it and relive to reveal it
'Cause if you do, my friends, you'll need a painkiller
Rock to the beat, put your body to it
Find a new dance and learn how to do it
So when you come in the place and feel our rhythm
You'll be on time with the def momentum
Stop perpetratin', get on the floor
And listen to the two with the rhymes galore!
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

Well now you gotta be convinced that the beat is fresh
So devastating, outlasting the rest
And our rhymes are fierce and always on fire
So get on the floor because it's for hire
A powerful sound that's so divine
Send a chill up your spine and rotate your behind
And we're  to the person who knows how to do it
So get on the floor and into it
So just start to rockin' when you feel the groove
And listen to us and bust a move
So move your body in every way
And don't stop rockin' 'til the break of day
We're the dedicated rappers on the M-I-C
One's Markie Dee, the other's Kool Rock Ski
And the question of the matter, we're asking to you
We can feel it, so can you feel it too?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-can-you-feel-it-lyrics
The Place to Be,Fat Boys,1984,"One-two, one-two, I'm the MC-dominating Kool Rock Ski
And I'm known to be the prince of rap, the Prince Markie Dee
Finesse and skill and you know he's able
Cutting up the beat on the two turntables
From his left hand, his right, and back to the left
 'cause it sounds so def
He's strong as a bull and I'm hard as a rock
I'm the Prince Markie Dee and he's the DJ Doc
With Kool Rock on the side, always on the go
So c'mon Kool Rock, let's start the show!
Well I'm Kool Rock Ski, I live in Brooklyn
Love catching girls when their guys ain't looking
Too hot to handle, too cold to squeeze
Guaranteed to please all the jazzy ladies
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
Don't wear silver boy, I do wear gold!
I'll be rappin' on the mic takin' complete control
So Markie Dee, ha ha, my throat is weak
Why don't you get on the mic and let me hear you speak
A full year on the list, reachin' for the top
And if you let me keep rockin', I rock nonstop
'Cause I'm pushing the pound, and claiming to be
The best mo' sucker on the M-I-C
Five foot eight, Pisces is my sign
And to keep a party jumpin' I'll persist to rhyme
The PMD, I be known as a layer
With a mic and rhyme I'll be tight as a slayer
I'm shakin' and breakin' like a ragin' beast
'Cause I'm the Puerto Rican prince and I live in the East
Bust that y'all (that y'all), bust this y'all (this y'all)
When I find my revolver, I never miss
Kool Rock (What up?)
My throat is weak
Homeboy, get on the mic and let me hear you speak
Well I'm the MC killer, the MC thriller
And when it comes to rappin' I'm the cool-chiller
I chill out the  when it's time to learn
Kool Rock on the mic, I never get burned
But any MC in the place to be
I'm the microphone magician and the chief of the East
I'm just too hot to handle well it's time to see
That Kool Rock, is the chief of the East
Take that y'all (that y'all), this y'all (this y'all)
And  I'll never admit
Prince Markie Dee ha! (that's me!)
My throat is gettin' sore (c'mon!)
Why don't you get on the mic and use your rhymes galore
Now this is the story, I'ma tell it as I can
About Peter Parker known as Spiderman
So from building to building and from tree to tree
And sometimes mingle with the young ladies
He could stick to the wall like a piece of Scotch tape
Couldn't use the door, used the fire escape
Now Spidey was chillin', on the loose one night
Just looking for a freak with his super sight
Heard a sound, or two, three or it was it four?
Then two big dudes ran out the door
, goddamn they mad
One had the gold, the other  in hand
Spidey put up a suit, they shot one twice
But Spidey was on 'em like white on rice
Spidey trap went off, bust his butt
Took the gold right back with a hero's grunt
Gettin' ready to leave, found a gun to his head
Was the dude with the gun that Spidey said
The dude pulled the trigger, but nothing came out
Because the gun was empty he began to shout
Spidey beat 'em down, gave the girl back her gold
He looked at her, she didn't look so old
Everything went smoothly, and very good
And Spidey's still swinging in your neighborhood
So DJ 
DJ Doc, get on the mic and rock the whole block!
Well you come to the East, you got to be mad
Because the get-down Doc do it all damn night
You could bring your homeboy, your whole damn crew
Don't make no sense 'cause I ain't you
It's a ladies choice, the master voice
Don't even need no bad Rolls-Royce
Just let me get a 98
With a super freak then I'll be straight
When I freak the party you won't go home
Homeboys and girls in the Twilight Zone
You just rock it in a pocket like it's out of style
I came to do for a little while
So come on, little child, if you wanna dance
And I can show you Smurf 
So come on, babydoll, this ain't no thing
Just get on the floor, shake your sexy thing
Yes yes y'all, yes yes y'all (yes y'all)
'Cause the beat is so, so fresh y'all (fresh y'all)

Yeah,  right!
You're batting oh-for-one hundred,  homeboy,  your in a slump!
You shouldn't talk junk like that!
You been drivin' around in your grandmother's Cadillac!
Gold,  flashin' on your chest!
Hold up!  Is that gold?!  Yo,  that's paint!  Who you tryin' to impress!
You been livin' like a perpetrator!  You d-mn clown!
Yo,  why you come around my way!  You ain't down!

A funky,  dope car,  sitting on the corner!
You're chilling hard with the brand-new paint job!
People surround you like birds on bread!
The music's blasting;  You're bopping your head!
A girls walks over and says,  ""Ooh,  I love it!""
You crack a smile and say you just bought it!
And for your sake,  yo,  you hope and pray
They just don't take a look at the license plate!
Time is passing and you're still flashing;
The day is smooth;  Your car is slamming!
So,  what do you have to lose?
You pick a fly girlie up and put the car in cruise!
Destination love is reignin' the spot;
Same old people,  flockin' and jockin';
Eyes wide open,  lips are droppin'!
Somebody's gettin' suspicious!
Now,  here's the plot!  So,  you better not miss this!
Your day was fun,  but now he's gonna end it
When someone yells out,  ""Yo,  your car is rented!""

The whole truth and nothin' but the truth!
To set me free!  I see you're on a lyin' spree!
Now,  you've done it,  you're lyin' on me!
And I'll be damned!  I'm not gonna have it!
Messin' around with your low-life habits!
And if you confront me with your ignorance
You'll get body-slammed to the ground!
Pound to dust!  So,  bust what I'm gettin' at:
Speakin' fiction?  Man,  I talk back!
Perpetrators!  Preachin' like phonies!
Enough is enough!  It's time I got rough!
Snoopin',  sniffin',  chumps are slippin'!
Girls are cheating!  Others are thieving!
It's time to bring it down to a hold:
Lying to another to save your soul;
To let the truth run like a river;
From lung to tongue down to the liver!

Song:   If It Ain't One Thing It's Anuddah (Bruddah)
Intro:  Prince Markie Dee
Man,  all these problems in our world today
I just don't know what to do,  man
Verse One:  Prince Markie Dee
If it ain't one thing,  it's another
Sell a million copies?  They put me on a magazine cover
I sell one or two,  they claim that I'm played out
My girl nags me at home,  so,  I shoulda stayed out
I buy a new car,  it runs out of gas
In school,  I was always gettin' kicked out of class
Mom would say,  ""Be like your older brother!""
If it ain't one thing it's another
Talk:  Prince Markie Dee
You know what I'm sayin' man?
I mean,  all these problems
Let me tell ya `bout the time when I - Well,  let me break it down for ya
Verse Two:  Prince Markie Dee
Picked up my date at eight in a happy mood
Drove to City Island for some seafood
$3.99 for all you can eat
Shrimp galore,  bon apetit
We ate hearty `till we couldn't eat
Went to the Marriott,  paid for a suite
She was anxious even more that me
And,  man,  I got busy as a bumblebee
When we were done,  I drove her home
Proceeded to my house,  all alone
It started rainin',  I was playin' Bobby Brown
I missed my exit,  so,  I circled around
And that's when it happened,  I didn't get far
A pole jumped in front of my car
I broke my leg,  man,  do I stutter?
If it ain't one thing,  it's anuddah,  bruddah
Verse Three:  Kool Rock Ski
On tour for so long that it wears me down
I've been to every city and every small town
And,  after a while,  things start to ache
I want my body to move,  that d-mn thing won't shake
Then,  one night,  the last date on tour
From that morning my throat was sore
I started gettin' worried,  it wound't be long
`Cause the way my throat was hurtin',  it would soon be gone
Then,  wouldn't you know?  You know it,  yes
I tried to say somthin' but I was voiceless
Showtime came,  I had to lip-synch
It got so wild that I couldn't think
The show was done,  a doctor checked my health
I spent the night all by myself
Man,  what a bummer,  what did I stutter?
If it ain't one thing,  it's anuddah,  bruddah",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-if-it-aint-one-thing-its-anuddah-bruddah-lyrics

Album:  On And On
Song:   Just Loungin'
Verse One:  Prince Markie Dee
To the point,  straight from the source
Double Benzito and one Porsche!
A girl in the passenger seat,  me,  I'm steering;
To make a long story short,  I was gearing
Patent leather!  Silk!  Credit cards!
A pocket full of money!  The whole nine yards!
Off to the beach and I must discuss
That the night was hot and full of lust
It ain't nothin' new,  it's an everyday thing
And if I ain't with a girl,  I swing
You know,  hang with the fellas at the disco
Buff was actin' wild off a bottle of Cisco
Cory and Joe were in the back profilin'
Me and Kool Rock were cold stylin'
Girls in abundance,  all of `em scroungin'
But me,  man?  Yo,  I'm just loungin'
Word up,  I'm just loungin'
Verse Two:  Kool Rock Ski
Me and the crew or should I say posse
Had the music kickin' in the 4x4 Jeep
We took the top off and then we stopped
At the pizza shop to get something to eat
Just then we saw some cuties cruisin'
So,  we pursued them,  We thought that we knew them
But,  boy,  was I psyched
Cause I'd never seen these girls before in my life
So,  we kept on riding
Man,  the day was hot,  word up,  I ain't lying
And,  yo,  you should have seen us
On the strength,  I was set
Stopped at the red light,  popped in my cassette
And you thought you was chillin'?
Man,  you ain't seen nothin' yet,  man,  I was just loungin'
Word up,  I was loungin'
Verse Three:  Kool Rock Ski / Prince Markie Dee / Buff Love (The Human Beat

Kool Rock Ski:
Takin' a break from all the bull that hounds you
From all the trouble that surrounds you
From all the negative hype
When you say to yourself that everything is gonna be allright

Word,  take it slow
Day by day,  that's the way life should go
You don't need to ill,  so,  now you know
Take it easy `cause I said so

Around the world to wherever I choose

On the strength,  I think I'll do the same

Prince Markie Dee:
Wait up,  Rock,  we can chill together
Kool Rock Ski:
Ain't nothin' wrong with that,  my brother
Yo,  Buff,  how's that soundin'?

Treat him like a stepchild
Hit him in the lip,  I fight like a rat,  who's scared when I get wild?
But let me think for a moment
Do I really wanna go through that with my opponet
Thinkin' about the things he did
Broke my teeth,  took my money,  when I was a kid
The hell with it!  Bring on that sucker

Gonna be a throwdown
And when it's over somebody gotta go down
It's a shame it came down to this
But it's time I got rid of this pestilence
Heart is beatin',  beatin' real quick
'Cause sooner or later,  some blood is gonna drip
Whether it's mines or his
Well,  anyway,  back to the fight!  Listen up!  Bust it
The crowd then gathered around
To see the Rock get pound to the ground
He threw a left hook straight to the jaw
It was the hardest punch I ever felt before
I retaliated with a kidney shot
A left to the ribs and went to the top
The top of the head,  that is!  He took a fall
And that's the end of:  (trouble)

We want to?show the people, that we are the best

We got an ultimate sound and a funky new beat
I'm number one, I'm number two, check out number three
We got a human beat box, who's hot like fire
Make the other beat box, just want to retire
So if you think it's time to make that move
Don't start the hesitation, just get into the groove
As you break

Now, once upon a time, in a land called grime
Crazy people runnin' 'round, actin' like slime
Sayin', ""Boy I'm gonna get ya, if ya try to tie""
""If you don't give me, what you call mine""
I can't look for my boys, up the street
It don't do no good, 'cause they're too weak
I can't take this deal, to the man
I'd just waste my time, but they don't understand
So what ya gonna do when you can't get help?
I gotta be a vigilante, go for self
'Cause this New York town, you might think it's funny
It' rough, it's tough and it's takin' your money
Wheelin', stealin', double-dealin'
Everybody's killin' just to get that feelin'

So move off the block boy, don't be a man's toy
Get yourself a J-O-B
Leave all the homeboys, let them destroy, face reality

I live in the city with a man on my back
Houndin' me around, like a dog on a cat
The boy think he bad, because he got it like that
Walkin' around with his dope field hat
Doin' cee-lo dice tryin' to make your livin'
You think of givin' up, but you're never gonna give in
Runnin' down the street with your head up high
'Cause everybody knows you're a thief in disguise
Tryin' to hang with the big shots, boy you ain't hot
'Cause everything you get, everybody done got
So slow on your pace, so weak in your face
Everytime I turn around, you're always getting chased

So move off the block boy, don't be a man's toy
Get yourself a J-O-B
Leave all the homeboys, let them destroy, face reality

The man down the street with the big white hat
Why do his shoes go clickity-clack?
'Cause he got a big car and he's got much money
His name is The Mack, and he wants you honey
Just step into my ride, you and I
We'll stroll to my crib on the upper east side
Where the rich people party and drink Bacardi
Wine and dine 'til the morning light
And we can make love, all night long
C'mon big momma, it'll be alright
So in a couple of weeks, you'll be out in the street
Workin' on the corner with the rest of his freaks
Just a poor and black sucker with the beautiful suck
He just wants a baby darlin' 'cause he think it helps
So if you're walkin' down the street and you see that hat
Just remember that The Mack is a hamburger snack

So move off the block boy, don't be a man's toy
Get yourself a J-O-B
Leave all the homeboys, let them destroy, face reality
T-T-T

(Beat boxing)

I live in the city on a crazy block
Somebody stole my car right out of the lot
Now I gotta take the train, so damn hot
Curse once in the bar, somebody gets shot
Gotta float through the streets, all kind of nice
'Cause I ain't got my ride and you know it ain't right
My girl had the nerve to call me a boy
'Cause I can't cruise around in my shiny black toy
Her money ran out and so did she
Nobody left but me-ah
It's reality
It's you and me
And black people, white people, can't you see?
No matter what the color of your skin
If we just say, ""Hi"", you can be my friend

So move off the block boy, don't be a man's toy
Get yourself a J-O-B
Leave all the homeboys, let them destroy, face reality

You just work those corners, use those drugs
You're livin' in a house full of roaches and bugs
No high school diploma, can't tell the time
No money in your pocket, not even a dime
Spent half your days, roamin' the streets
You got dirty pete checks set on your feet
Have fights with the eye but never win
Crackers in the boiler said, ""His side was Gin""
T-Bird, Night Train, Olde Gold team
Get drunk as hell, lick the bottles clean
Get the welfare checks, you think you're on
You get ripped-off then your heart is torn
Then the only action is, a life of crime
Kickin' people up, takin' every last dime
It's sad, this guy who was hot to trot
With the trey-eight, his brother just shot
Shot you in the head, and now you're slayed
The cops didn't see it and nothing was said
You were just forgotten and now you're gone
So I put you down with Santa Claus, Brian's Song

So move off the block boy, don't be a man's toy
Get yourself a J-O-B
Leave all the homeboys, let them destroy, face reality

Take our advice, just stay in school
Get a good, honest job, don't play the fool
Don't smoke no reefer, don't drink no beer
Keep a straight mind, and have no fear
And when you get something new, you better watch your back
Because the people 'round here'll bust a cap off your cat
And if your asked to do somethin' you don't want to do
Like using those drugs or sniffing that glue
Turn it down then turn around
Walk away like you own the town
You'll be proud of yourself, for what you are
Move ahead in life and you will get far
And when you have young ladies runnin' around and down
Give 'em our advice and say, ""Pass it down""

So move off the block boy, don't be a man's toy
Get yourself a J-O-B
Leave all the homeboys, let them destroy, face reality

Don’t Be Stupid,The Fat Boys Are Back,1985,"(Intro/Chorus)
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
(2x)
(Verse 1)
It was the first of the month and I was on my way
Out of the house to catch the subway
People pushin' and shovin' but I didn't pull rank
Cause I was in a hurry to get to the bank
I walked into the door, what did I see
About 50 people in front of me
Then all of a sudden from out of nowhere
There was a man with a gun, wavin' it in the air
He said this ain't new, ya seen it before
So why don't everybody just hit the floor
He jumped up on the counter said Don't act funny
Just do what I say and fill these bags with money
He was on his way out with all the loot
But the cops were there first, and they started to shoot
They shot him down, straight in the head
Homeboy was stupid, and now he's dead
Chorus
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
Verse 2
There was once a girl, her name was Judy
She was so fine with the big fat booty
But Judy was a kind of stupid girl
Who only liked guys that gave her diamonds and pearls
Material things was all she was after
And if you had the money to hear her laughter
She would laugh in your face and call you a bum
And dis you in the middle like she was dumb
Then late one night, Judy went to the store
To get some bread and milk, and not much more
But on her way back pulled up a Cadillac
It was black on black, and black to be exact
Down came the window then Judy smiled
He whispered in her ear, can you talk for awhile
But Judy said she only liked rich men
But then nobody saw Judy again
Chorus
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
(Alright..)
Verse 3
I know a homeboy who liked to gamble
But when it all ended his life was in shambles
Blackjack, Poker, Cee-lo, Roulette
7-11 or any kind of bet
One day he went to the track with the daily double
Lost his paycheck and got into trouble
Cause he didn't buy food for his family to eat
Any clothes on their back or shoes for their feet
So he stayed in the street to make the money back
When he played the numbers and tried a game a blackjack
Some hands win and he couldn't be beaten
But no one knew homeboy was cheatin'
When they found out, and they started to shout
Beat him down cause he had no clout
That's the moral of the story
It may sound gory
Don't ever try to gamble in another territory
Chorus
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid

But if you raise his temperature, he will turn green
His clothes will rip and his body grows
His feet turn big and everybody knows
That he's The Hulk, one big body
The main attraction at your party
The brother that's strong like a thousand men
He can break brick walls and your bars he'll bend
Now Bruce was chillin' one Saturday
Was by himself with nothing to say
Then, this big hairy creature came from the sky
Bruce ran away thought he was gonna die
Then he thought to himself this guys just bulk
I'm gonna kick his butt as the incredible Hulk
Bruce came back all green and big
And he kicked his hairy butt, dig
You don't believe, run it through a scanner
And that is the story of Dr. Bruce Banner
Yeah, that Bruce Banner, boy

To a certain peak that break all rules

'Cause the words I preach for you to hear
To take a look with your eyes and open your ears
'Cause my smile is better than anyone ever
I'm chillin' with Lees and I don't wear leather

At top of our lungs, until we reach our peak

It's time to party, it's time to blink
It's time to get down, it's time to shake
It's time to show you why we rock so well
Because the jams we make are guaranteed to sell
Now there are many other crews that rock the shows
Like Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow
Whodini and The Force MDs
Grandmaster Melle Mel and Run D.M.C
But it's time to show you that we also rock
To feel the funky rhythms all around the block
So just start to rockin' everybody guess what
Homeboys and girls, we're gonna pump it up, ha!
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
Now you walk into the party, the place is jumpin'
Everyone is rockin', their bodies are pumpin'
You feel a certain somethin', to move your butt
From side to side, with the cut
You feel the release of so much grief
You don't have to sit around baby here's the beef
'Cause I'm gonna get on the floor, do my thing
And if I have to wobble then I'm gonna swing
'Cause I'm gonna serve me a freak like this and that
Serve her from the front, side and back
I'm gonna catch me a beat and keep that pace
Giggle and wiggle while I rock the place
Punch up something, to keep us going
Swaying to the side while the beat is flowing
Forget the emotions that you're showing
Hurry up, get funky while the beat is growing
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down

Now I'm pumpin' it live, and tickle your brain
And when I finish rappin' you won't be the same
'Cause the bass is soothing, keeps your ground moving
And once you get started, you can't stop grooving
A taste of the trebles, on the right level
Funky fresh beat, a definite mellow
Chief dominator, rap innovator
Servin' MCs just like Darth Vader
Kool Rock SKi to keep the party jumpin'
If I deflate, I keep on pumpin'
Pumpin' up the party with the rhymes I say
Keep the girls on tip with no delay
'Cause the beat is on, cause much attraction
Never gets dull, always full of action
I get  while only in your dreams

Right
 hey ya,  hey ya
And my friend, Kool Rock Ski, how you doin' partna?
Coolin' in the place to be, as we rock for hours a little something like this
And my name is, Markie Dee (right)
But you can call me the Prince
And right about this time, we're about to rock reggae with the Fat Boys
Hello teacher
Hello class
Begin

Now on the farthest island where corn was peeled
The father would work on the plantation field
But that was then, and now it is time
To celebrate the reggae man, with this rhyme
Now my name is Prince, code name Markie Dee
And the king of reggae, is the late, great Bob Marley
And there are other great men, and it must be said
That one of these men, is the one Sammy Dread
Also, Jacob Miller, and Dennis Brown
Michigan and Smiley, are the best around
There's also Sassafrass, and Welton Irie
And there's another great rapper, Colonel Desie
But let it be known, that I'm rapping OK
'Cause I am rapping, hard core reggae

Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Part two

I be the certified rapper in the U-S-A
But I also like to rap to the beat of reggae
Peter Tosh is the man with the reggae voice
Worldwide musician, the people's choice
'Cause I'm takin' much control with the mic in my hand
I'm the reggae-rap chief like the King Yellowman
To soothe your body, with words so smooth
With beats so fresh, put you into the groove
Reggae music's so divine, it sounds so sweet
Guaranteed rock rhythm, to move your feet
'Cause it's me, Kool Rock, dominatin' MC
And I'm rappin' hard core, to the reggae beat
So everybody get ready, the beat is steady
And Fat Boys rap to the hard core reggae

Hands up, shoot 'em up, put 'em down
Shoot 'em up, now down, shoot 'em up
Hit 'em now, shoot 'em up
Hit 'em now, shoot 'em up
Hit 'em up

You got, things on your shirt
Girl you know, it hurt, 'cause it wasn't mine
Said it wasn't mine
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Hard, hard, hard core reggae

Reggae music is on fire, reggae music is so sweet
Reggae music got a funky, funky, serious beat
Vibrate your ears, and rock your mind
Make all the posses, move your behind
Ah-move, ah-left and then ah-right
You know reggae music, it sounds so nice
The people is fresh, the music is OK
Everybody to the beat called hard core reggae

Hit 'em up, shoot 'em up, hit 'em down
Hit 'em now, hit 'em up
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
That's on the parties and the fellas stand back
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Do you like, do you like the way, the way
I walk that walk

Fat Boys Scratch,The Fat Boys Are Back,1985,"One two, one two in the place to be
Just open your eyes and you will see
That I'm the Chief Dominator called Kool Rock-Ski
And to my side, the Prince of Rap, Prince Markie Dee
And we're back with rhymes galore coming out the back door
To show you our devastating creation to rock-shock the nation
 four, five, six  people's 
He's our Cutmaster, DJ Doc Nice
Our DJ is a music generator
Cut specialist when he's on the cross-fader
A masterpiece rocker, rhythm powerlord
Defends with his music, he doesn't need a sword
His mixes are precise, he'll never do it twice
He's our Cutmaster, DJ Doc Nice
To never bite a mix is his only occupation
He practices for hours to make his own creation
His music is possessive (his cuts are aggressive)
B-boy is his style (?)
And if you should miss him (at any extension)
That way he  a set (there's no competition)
High potent energy (for a musical treat)
Doc Nice;s on the wheels (and he can't be beat)
By any DJ (that's in his way)
Like a lion don't play (you know he will slay)
So say what you want (if you dare)
Doc Nice's on the wheels so you better beware!
Number one DJ, ace in the place
Throw up with the bass while he plays in your face
Enthusiasm grows as he motivates the crowd
Tension seems low as the music goes loud
For some DJs it's a hopeless dream
But for DJ Doc it's an everyday scene!
His versatile style is on top of the pile
Because  display will attract your smile
To other DJs he will over compare
For a normal living person, he's too  to bare
Movement of your arms, bumpin' in the fly
By now you will have noticed, he's not your average guy
It's not synthesized, but a hardcore scratch
It's all locked up so turn the key and flip a latch
To turn up the volume and boost up the bass
And hear a real definition of rock the place!
Ladies and gentlemen, right about this time
On the wheels of steel, all the way live
We call him, the ox that rocks
Better known as the Human Beat Box
But otherwise known as DJ Doctor Nice
The real Cutmaster
And my name is, the Prince Markie Dee
And I'll be the dominator of 
Kool Rock-Ski, and we are...
The Fat Boys, you know we're down by law
In the engineer room right about this time
 what's up homeboy?
KB rock the house!
Kurtis Blow, Kurtis Blow, wake up man, why you sleeping?
Gettin' that good stuff in effect, huh?
Number one producer, no one gets looser
The man we call KB, better known as Kurtis Blow
And he didn't ask us to say that
I wear Adidas!
I wear Puma!
Stop lyin' you don't wear 
Forget about it, I'm an Adidas man
I wear Adidas everyday
The Human Beat Box wears Pro Keds
I wear Nikes!",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-fat-boys-scratch-lyrics
Rock ‘N’ Roll,The Fat Boys Are Back,1985,"Sound like a fat grippin' it
We are The Fat Boys!
And we wanna kick it
Well why you wanna kick it?
Who are we? Who are we?
We are The Fat Boys!
You wanna slide?
And we're not gonna take it no more!
We are The Fat Boys!
And we're not gonna take it no more!
Who are we?
We are The Fat Boys!
I said, and we are not gonna take it no more!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Prince Markie Dee, make your body rock
And I still got the same old 
Kool Rock-Ski, big and strong
To you sucker MCs this is our song
And the Human Beat Box, and once, twice, thrice
But otherwise known as Doctor Nice
Don't do that mic, the rhymes we write
And if you try to recite then we'll have to come fight
And do not forget the words that we speak
'Cause all of them strong, none of them weak
So just put your hands together and clap to the rap
And if you feel that rhythm let your fingers snap
'Cause feelin' the rock is all you need to know
And if it's fast you clap, it'slow you blow
'Cause the ladies of the way,  turn it out
It's an electric thrill, whoever shock the house
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Now we're takin' control, and even command
Well we can crush sucker MCs in the palm of my hand
We capitate their heads and throw them into the sea
'Cause I'm Prince (and I'm Kool) we're in the place to be
Now there's a lot of talk about the things we've eaten
But on the microphone we've never been beaten
 the Prince and I will state my name
But I'll never let another MC put me to shame
See I've traveled the world on a steady crew
I got the words to make you move
Just give me the mic, it's that I'll shock
I'm the dominator, and my name is Kool Rock
United we'll stand, divided we'll fall
Toppling us like a great big wall
The mic is my gun, the voice ammunication
To the sucker MCs we're the only competition
So feel the  when it hits the skin
'Cause when we're in a battle, we always win!
Your future's been decided, so take a rest
'Cause we're The Fat Boys and we are the best
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!

Now we can rock real loud, rap real low
We can rock real fast, or rap real slow
But any way you put it, we still rock def
Rock up and down, right to left
From a little house party to a very big jam
All we need is a stage and mic in hand
And one to a million, people to shock
But the  we just plain rock
Now our rock is complete, a devastating feat
And now you could head back to your seat
But before you do that, throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em around like you just don't care
Now you heard our little test, you listened to the best
I pass the mic  gonna finish the rest
Now your  over, your body relieved
And rest assured you know that we...
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!
Rock!
And roll!",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-rock-n-roll-lyrics
"The Twist (Yo, Twist!) - Feat. Chubby Checker",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee, Twist
Aah, we're back
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Take me by my little hand and go like this
The party was packed, I'm talkin' back to back
There was a rapper that was rappin' to a beat that was wack
They was going through the motions out on the dance floor
An' when the rapper was done they wasn't yellin' encore
The people were tired of the same old groove
They wanted something def, something new and improved
Something easy to do but hard to resist
I got something for y'all, what do you call it? The Twist!
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take us by our little hands and go like this
We, we, we broke into the booth and the record stacks
Came up with The Twist and we were scratchin' the track
People started jammin' hard to the funky sound
Did The Twist down and up, then up and down
Then I heard somebody yell: ""Yo Chubby's here""
The people took a little pause just to stop and stare
He said: ""I'll show you people how to Twist with style
'Cause I've been doin' The Twist for a long long while""
Oh you should see Prince Markie Dee
Check out that Kool Rock is rockin' like me
Here comes B-Beat Box, come on, do it Buffy
Com' com' com' come on baby
Com' com' com' com' come on baby
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist
Ooh ooh do do do The Twist
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chub and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and do The Twist
Chubby took my sister down to the dance floor
Did The Twist so def, the crowd yelled for more
So I pulled it with my mussle, did my flow with my coil
And when Buff did the Limbo we was rockin' the world
Come on baby, let's do The Twist
Chubby Checker and the Fat Boys, we're doin' The Twist
Take the world by the hand and go like this
Hey hey, England, do The Twist, Twist
And France, do The Twist, Twist
Ha ha ha, Holland, do The Twist, Twist
And Germany, do The Twist, Twist
And all over Europe, do The Twist, Twist, do The Twist, Twist
(Ha ha ha ha) come on baby
(Twist to the left, Twist to the right) let's do The Twist
(Twist up and down, Twist all night)
Chubby Checker (come on, come on) and the Fat Boys
(Come on, come on, come on, come on) we're doin' The Twist
(Come on, come on, come on) take us by our little hands
And go like this
Oh yeah, and do The Twist
Yeah, just like me
Ooh yeah, and do The Twist
Oh yeah",https://genius.com/Fat-boys-the-twist-yo-twist-feat-chubby-checker-lyrics
