Sex Appeal,Back 2 the Game,2002,"(Johnny P)
Whoaaaa
And ya got that sex appeaaal
(Verse 1, N.A.R.D)
She had a walk too sassy
Approachin' with a dog that looked like Lassy
The lip-stick, and the Fendi, Prada
Kinda lookin' all classy
Psychological tendency, proto-call
Just lookin' at the article
Weed smell on my Prada clothes
Sometimes, I trip on myself
How I spit at these modern ho's
On the two-way, poppin' and droppin' the conversation
And I'm steady staggerin'
Look at the Remy that I had last week off Madison
Tryin'a walk a straight line
But I can't find a pattern in her
I looked at the door
Put my drink on the floor
Cocked my nine when I opened it slow
Half-breed Chinese, sittin' a Lac
And about a hash green, plus
The audacity of the star
Strippin' and maneuver her ass like next to me
Actually, this S-E-X is testin' me
A double P, E-A-L
And it sound like her body is callin' me
But it might be the alcohol in me
And the sex appeal, it keep on drawin' me
(Hook, Johnny P)
Sex, sex, appeaaal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeaal
Sex, sex, appeaaal
Her body keep callin' mee, whoooaa
Sex, sex, appeaaal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal, giirl, whooa right
Sex, sex, appeaaal, whoaaaa-aahhh
(Verse 2, Belo)
I'm finna get her off, high Hydro
Bump a crown from mista porch
Hey there lil' mama
Do you wanna come kick your heels
In the back of my Range Rove?
Wanna do what'chu did before?
Don't trip, cause ""You Already Know""
C-O-M-E-B-E-W-I-X-T, that me, Belo
Just do it ""Nice and Slow""
You gotta raise the door
And I don't pay for show
Cause I don't pay fo-sho
You can grab yo' kicks and go
Put on yo (shhh) let's roll
Recognize the G, true ballin'
Do or Die, pimp or die, not fallin'
When we all in, yo club
Chillin' with the chiefs and the dubs
And I got love for the jigga-boos
Pop Chrys' with the niggas, and the bitches too
Dig a bitch out the Grove, like I just do
People say I'm like a statue
Spit the B in yo ear
Take you off to the real, and I match you
Sex appeal
(Hook, Johnny P)
Sex, sex, appeaaal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeaal, girrrl
Sex, sex, appeaaal
Her body keep callin' meee, whoooaa
Sex, sex, appeaaal
I'm talkin' bout sex appeal, giirl, whooaaa, na-na-na-na-naaa
(Verse 3, Twista)
Go kick it wit' my niggas in the drop Regal
Do what? A Twista, Caddy, Po-Pimp sequel
On my way to the club, peek-a-boo motherfucka
But first I gotta roll one, for my people
Hate us for doin' that, saw us
Through Windy City, night crawlers
Who would of imagined lyricals on the legacy
Cities legendary like, Rap-A-Lot and Legit Ballaz
Shit, let the Mo' pop, and drop the top
Ride like it's summer-time in the Chi
Get'chu blind, to the abra
Blowin' lime to the sky
Rhyme til' I die, tryin' to get by
Lil' miss, lookin' tight in the coochie
Whether it's a Gucci
Love the way you do the jiggy when you walk
Soundin' like you freaky, girl, every time you talk
I know ya aura make the fellas wanna break 'em off
Hear me brotha?
Gotta try to get our feet further
Hit a lic and feed, one-another
Cause all we got is, each-other
I take it week-after-week
And to kick the flows that I freak but, uhh
Roll up on a chick and, spit game
Let me show you how the back seat of a Lexus feel
Take a hit of sess and chill
Girl, dressed to kill
Whippin' that sex appeal
Next appeal?
(Hook, Johnny P)
Sex, sex, appeaaal (Whooaaa)
I'm talkin' bout sex appeaal, heeeyyy
Sex, sex, appeaaal
Said her body keeeeeeeep
Sex, sex, appeaaal (Callin', callin', callin' meee)
Sex, sex, appeaaal (Callin', callin', callin' meee)
Sex appeal, sex, sex appeal
Sex appeal, sex appeal (Talkin' about)
Sex appeal, sex, sex appeal (Ohh yeah)
Sex appeal, sex appeal (Bring it on, bring it on)

3 A.M.,Back 2 the Game,2002,"I'm a pick you up at 3 when you hear me blow my horn, bump bump bump bump bump.....
While we sip on Hennessey hit the speed in the cut would you come come come
Would you come come come would you come come come

3 double O AM she step into my x-5 beamer
You should have seen her
With a rubber perfection you can put it in a session with Janet Jackson
Little league the chemistry was up to satisfaction
With a magnificent ark spark bringing flame like a arsons
I locked the door and drove off and I drove off kind of slowly
Cause the popo's always blow me
And this is what she told me, she put her lips to my ear move closely
When we got into traffic she indicated what she working with and put her
Lips around my LORD HAVE MERCY
I drove and watch, I watched them grow, I spit my hen, I smoke my dro.. shit
In between conversations she was like....she was like...oohhh oohh ooh oh oh ooohhhh
You already know, she was already blown, she was already gone
She was already sprung gone with her tongue uh huh uh huh


Late at night all alone dream of you in those thongs, girl I wake up in the morning
Gotta have you cause I'm horny
I feel you on top of me, baby girl on top of me
I like the way you moan girl don't you know you got that humm girl

I'm on the phone talking to Mrs. Who
I don't wanna pump till the bottom white bloom
Tip type game all the things you do
Let her tease me, outta tease you
Baby want to come at 3 AM
She giving me the keys to the new B-M
Plus she giving me and you won't see him
And she giving me to the you see them
Pick up the phone then arrive at the door
She came out and the white touched the floor
Gotta lay back cause the rain goin pour
Hope for the shade make it one night more
Looking like a diva with the queens on tour
I belong she's allmo
In the bedroom now its time for sex
Anything goes you can walk like mex
After making love and I will not jet
Up and down and around we go
I can feel her nails when she scream below
I'm a real pimp see I still gotta go
Some get pussy and they still don't know

No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (be gone)
No no no no no (see)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah now throw yo half
Put back on the things you ask
You the man when it's double dare I'm L I'm L
It really didn't matter too much to me
If he...didn't want you to ride with me (mmm)
Why would it matter when you're his girlfriend (mmm)
But your passing the Hennessey...oh babe

You might as well braid my hair too.. ohh ahhh",https://genius.com/Do-or-die-3-am-lyrics
Dead Homies,Back 2 the Game,2002,"Now I lay me down to sleep
Said I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
Said I pray the Lord, my soul to taaaaake

I feel like a bullet floatin' through the wrong hole
Seein' different dimensions and lost souls
Tackled by jackles and livin' my life on the wrong road
So I simply advise those to, travel through the black hole you
Incarcerated, but even though you've been obligated
At the bottom of the pit where the sharks are in it
Depressed and intoxicated, cloud my memories
Like someone just wished me, mayhem to infinity
So I pray that the end is around me
Cuz ain't no tellin' where the clowns'll be
Pre-meditated ground to me, how the fuck that sound to me
Frown to me, didn't know how to put your rounds on me
See my brother is dead, my daddy was lost in a car crash
My grandmother, killed by cancer
So I dealt wit' the cards that was dealt to me
People selfishly, keep askin' me this bullshit, like
What the fuck it felt to me? My nigga died in my arms
Wit' a jab in is left palm, I'm sinkin'
Deep in my membrane, to the finest thing which we call pain
The fact of the matter, it makes you wanna use them thangs, stress
Float through the B's we be smokin' on constantly
Wit' a buncha stereo-typin' niggas muggin' me and judgin' me
But the shit I love to see, is yo kids be huggin' me
To cross roles of reality, casually, casualties
This shit is still to me, so motherfuckas keep feelin' me
Cuz motherfucka it's real wit me

This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (This is for my homies)
This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (Ohh can you hear me)
This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (Comin' from the bottom of my heart, yeah)
This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (Ohhh)

I touch on my tummy and feel pain
I run up the ground as I cry rain
I feel like the pets out the membrane
I roll on the curb when I smoke Jane
Now tell me this bitch and this mark's name
I bet'cha this nigga da hot one
I'm burnin' this bitch when I spot one
And bring on the clique, cuz I shot one
I pick up the phone and I can't call
I'm hearin' the voice, but it ain't y'all
I scribble yo name on a stone wall
I drink the Remy wit' my road dawg
I'mma have to see if it come to
I'm gunnin' the nigga that gunned you
I'm one of the realest to run to
Can't wait til' the day that I'm with you
I'm seein' yo face on my back wall
Lil' Val took a slug in a downfall
Thats when I be in the crossfire
You ain't killed all of them, so I can't die
And revenge is a must, so I can't lie
I got niggas on the air, and they gon' ride
You and all of them boys, and we gon' fire
So sleep wit' yo guns in the darkness
I'm gonna be harder than hardest
I visit yo grave and reguardless
A mission regardless

Nigga, nigga, niiiiigga

This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (This is for my homies)
This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (It's been too hard livin')
This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (But I'm afraid to diiiiee)
This, is, for, my, deaaad homies (Woo!)

Now in the midst of the storm
Inject these lethal warnings
Be the torn, please rest they soul
The different load, only Christ only knows
Even though, we sit and blow, fold to the ways of time
J-Rock was sprayed with nines, now the blind, and leadin' the blind
You kiss me, because he wanted a Jag and sell those ki's to entrepreneurs
He can't seem to keep his life, on one accord
And it seem like death and jail is callin, for the same vocals
Got bullets that'll aim and choke you, worldwide and even local
Tellin' visions of tell how they soak you
But I'm not concerned with the evening news
Takin' clips of what this evil do
When the demons in hell's has led that you've been said, that you
School, may the Lord take care of you, conversations, we shared a few
While around, we laughed, broke some rules, smoked some weed
And share some bust styles too, now what am I gonna do
You gone and left me so befuddled
I pray that the Lord hear my heart and a sample my puzzle
And embracing cuddles, and I sent out prayers
And massive puddles

Now I lay me down to sleep
Said I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
Said I pray the Lord, my soul to taaaaake

This, is, for, my

Don’t Touch My Money,Back 2 the Game,2002,"Don't touch my money man
Don't touch my money man
Don't touch my mothafuckin money man

Welcome to the city of big ballers and players and hustlers
Where players be gettin paper from all these customers
Even from touchin drugs y'all still ain't touchin us
We be the low key playaz in the back with all that dust
See I keep my iced up while y'all gettin viced up
Niggas buyin nice trucks still get set right up
Wrong move, cus see we check hoes with long spoons
It's a must we gotta check 'em before they leave the room
I'm all about my money deniero fetti and cheeseay
Don't nothing please me unless my pockets gettin griezed playa

Don't touch my M O N E
Why all you voltures at me
Tryin to plot for the dough on the low key
But when it come to the dust you provoke me
Got silly hands out for a sawbuck
But runnin off at the mouth get your jaw stuck
Who that young boy got knocked out
Little poopy lil brother with the big mouth
See a pimp make move and sessions
And get the money when its there no questions
If he slip then he do it for the lesson
Hush hush when I'm askin a question
Cus if he new about hustle he'd be paid
Cop land take flight in the light shade
And a brother run up then he get sprayed
Otherwise at the mall wanna get laid
B E L O gone be paid
B E L O gone be paid
BE LO ZE RO don't touch


See I'mma hollar at my muhfucka
I don't fuck wit the bloodsucker
Smoke a dub of love wit the city gettin gritty for fitty itty bitty
Puttin it down like P. Diddy
Do or die just be rollin up like P's
Steppin outta the car and lil J runnin and slippin like Clyde Davis
Get it like I spit it, spit it like I get it for cheesey
Better yet if its easy now get the paper-paper
See they really wanna fade it fade it
Had to get crossed tossed or lost in the cement
2 double 0 1 Escalade and I ride like a veteran
Had it been you touchin on the paper
Get you left in a dumpster thats what you get for playin punkster
When we come to pump ya

Want me to tell you bout ice you can keep that
Wanna reach I'mma show you where the heat at
On the side of the seat did you peep that
6 left in the clip here keep that
Don't owe me show me that dust
Them boys on the block is dangerous
Everywhere we go we got them thangs with us
We some big cats they don't wanna bang with us, (uh uh)
Thats right, never let them tell you Na Sean ain't tight
I be on the paperchase day and night
I been tryin to make a million all my life
Ready to ride with do or die its no lie
We be tippin hard on the city's westside
And yea its kinda windy in the city called Chi
But we don't hesitate to let the bullets fly
Look him in the eye it's you and I",https://genius.com/Do-or-die-dont-touch-my-money-lyrics
Diamenz,Back 2 the Game,2002,"So I'll leave here mama I'll be there, ok
Cadillac (cadillac) pimpin... pimpin (escalade)
Do or Die Ridin through the cold Chi (riding so high)
Back 2 the game yall (were back Belo, AK)
Some pimpology (escalade) so obviously we learned there biology
(Do or Die J. P. lets ride)

Do you love, money, chasin papers and doin capers
Bending the chi and then vegas like you one of the Lakers
Steady cuffin that paper, ladys can't fake us, so I stay cautious regardless
Like a million dollars keep sparkin better yet its that V.I.P barkin
(niggas ain't ready to die)
Cause please, that be me sparkin sharp and bendin calm in that lac
Bendin hard with ladys slobbin and bobbin
Aww man I been on that chick since back in college
See, she like them top notch with the Glock cocked
Put the money and Glock block them CEO's who invest in stock plots
Substance blowin out the sunroof with your drop top
Smokin on that chop flop ladys call me pa pa and groupies call me na na
So cha cha like legit do whatever suits that fit you
If paper be your issue, then you be your issue
But this paper make that paper, and this paper make that paper
This paper make that paper so you stay away from haters

We ride diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Diggin in the scene with a gangster lean ohhhohhhhhh.. ohhoohhhh
We ride diamonds in the back, sunroof top
Diggin in the scene with a pimp lean ohhohhhh my my can you smoke and ride

You can see it in my eyes when I'm hustlin, burnt up tryin to come up from
Nothing
I be stackin them stacks bringin em back in the back of the lac
Talkin in codes to the burn outs hustlin daily got me turned out
You know my motto to invest and chase that paper like lotto
Follow, tryin to bring back money in car loads
But its hard to listen when you tryin to get that platinum benzy
Or purchase a home for my belo luxury home with a platinum visa
Its hard to imagine something like a nigga tryin to catch an orgasm
Track that feeling like a spasm
Tryin to study passin, got a passion gotta count that cheese
They off in the breeze but it ain't nothing
If you got that paper then say something
Better put it away Cause the day comin when you fall off
When you just wanna hall off with four sawed offs blow it all off
Recognise its the big faces that count, better yet better stay flexed
Check the paper stay stressed and get all the dough whether its fast or slow
Get up to the point where the cash will flow
Burger King and Mcdonalds really ain't the way the best will go
And its so cold in these windy streets
When the ends meet your life will be ends deep with white shit


This is my motto, pop the first bottle
Louie call 1 3 grab the key then follow
Ride up to my home paid for mansion celebrating you ladys on tables dance on
M O N E Y got to have it me I remember hustlin when I was a shorty
Now or a forty X5 5 of those sit back relax and private show
No how it go more money more problem well the problem is you solve it
Don't let the money become you you take it and revolve it
No matter how you get it you hustle and go get it square stick with it
Make sure all the numbers split Cause all of them done did it
The Rockafellers Stellers and Jones
To many other people got paper but we homeless
And let alone this, we chillin while we swervin bumpin 92.3 in the suburban
Hittin curbs in city fresh yall Proda to the feet bonapetite
No second guess yall we confess yall love the curency don't you playa hate
Love the game you can't worry me, you can't worry me


J P, J P
Everybody may not have a great big Cadillac
Gangsta white walls, TV's and antennas in the back (uh uh)
Some peoples may not have a car at all
But they got to remember brothers and sisters (remember)
We still can pimp talk, rotate them gangster white walls
Never givin a dime to a broad (no no never)
And we gone keep on pimpin baby (keep pimpin)
We gone keep on pimpin baby (for real)
Untill somebody turn the lights out, so J. P. come on bring us home

Yeah, wohhhhohhhohhhh wohhhohhhh
I just wanna feel, Cause you may not have a gravy kind of life
Diamonds in the back, sunroof top, diggin in the scene with a gangster lean
You may night driiivvveee no car at all, ohh myyy
But you can still stand tall, still stand tall... hooo

That’s My Car,Back 2 the Game,2002,"(Verse 1, AK)
Just, bailin' outta the bed
Crossed up with some ho with some nice head
Feelin' exhausted from the slow sex
Still sippin' on the last night's Moet
I'm bout to get dressed
So I pull out the Prada with the Gucci fit
Might as well pull out two fit
At the burger workin' too thick
Lookin' too slick, about to jump off wit' two chicks
On the way to the strip to bump off a new bitch
Got the digits, hit the Hydro too quick, skeet
Me and lil' or whatever in the hood when we campaign
Flamin' mary, bumpin' Champagne, later on get a lil' brain
If the head right, I'm in the Cadillac every night
Tinted windows, like air-tight
And it seem like... ch-oh-ch-ahhhh
Rich niggas, in the bread... ohh-ahhhhh
Bumpin' ho's and the woodgrain
I make 'em say ""Who Dat?"" (Who dat? Who dat?)
The colored nigga from the Chi, whoever knew that?
A Black n' Mild with some Hennessy, wit' two sacks
Nigga true dat...

And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! Thats my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

Little kids be like...
That's my car! That's my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar
(Verse 2, Belo)
Well I gotta pimp, like automatically
Cuz I kinda like a bitch, on the canopy
Baby mama lookin' very mad at me
But I choked her with the dick, like magically
And drastically, got a car full of ho's in my Escalade
Six T.V.'s in my Escalade, twenty inch rims on my Escalade
Thanks to babe, you niggas say ""ugh, ain't this some shhhh...?""
Dressed in black, Lou Dob hat, spells C-A-D-I, Cadillac
Bumpin' A-C with the ho's in the back
Used to be the clique, see two matter fact
And ""Pimpology"" keep the women in tact
Gettin' paper when I'm watchin' the Mac
Bet a hundred dollars, did I do that?
Niggas pay a ho, puttin' flaws in the game
And niggas say Belo put a pause to your name?
I'm a bad pimp, beat a ho with a flame
Niggas ain't changed, y'all know the game
I could meditate while a girl gimme brain
Dodgin' the pump when I'm switchin' the lane
""Money ain't a Thang"", chicks ain't a thang
Chrys' ain't a thang, hoggin' the lane
(Hook, Johnny P)
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! Thats my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar
And We be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my car! That's my car!
And we be ridin' Lacs
Little kids be like...
That's my caaar, that's my caaar

Yo, when you don't grow up in this game
Ain't know about your walk
Or how many chicks ya got
Or who could ride a colder slab
Cause we ""Still Po Pimpin'""
Puttin' it down wit' the oldest macks
See I was told the fact that
Good game check all game
And y'all could be messin' wit these broads and thangs
Have a nigga bein' Crip, gettin' all at'cha thangs
Be stepped up, but how yall gonna explain?
And uhh... hell nah she can't come for my dough
But why she gon' fight other chicks, I don't know
Some of 'em move befo' they pass through the floor
See I could go pass for a chick to the dope
And uhh....

See we don't love these ho's
And we don't trust these ho's
Gotta stay above these ho's
All I know, we just fuck these hooo's
(Verse 3, continued)
That's what a old pimp told me
Never love a chick that be runnin' the streets
Never love a chick that be gone for weeks
Never love a chick that be offerin' your peep's
If she gon' creep, then gon' let her creep
If she gon' cheat, then gon' let her cheat
If she gon' freak, then gon' let her freak
If a ho don't work, then a ho don't eat
(Hook, Johnny P)

I Got a Problem,Back 2 the Game,2002,"I got a problem with you bitches, and since I got a problem with you bitches
I'm about to handle nation business
Knock off the witness so he can't witness vicious attitudes
I'm fuckin at you dude I'm fuckin at you dude

I'm about to snap and let my index work (my index work)
And gonna put no stain up on your forehead but instead its well'd up in your shirt
In the darkest alley niggas put in work, with a jerk
And a nigga gone fall or back up cus we come with two chromes and act up
Like these bitches being counterfeit I'mma bring some drama to your home
Like nigga we ain't gonna fly for shit, and besides it get on some lethal shit
How many niggas want a war when they know they fuckin people get
Cheif four dome smacked up tech nine the shoes will back up
Put a pause on the knife appoligise twice or I might just act up
He's standing bare when he can barely stand
How many ignorant muthfuckas gotta lose there life to be a man
That super shit gone break your dinner plate
Cus I got 16 hollow niggas and they quick to go retaliate
Wait we got about 16 20's that will be 32 muthafuckas comin off up in your ass nigga


Comin quick with the 17 hot ones, acommodated by the 17 shotguns
Tell the muthafucka with the malfunction, how to function
Hit him with the pump 2 times rewind, hit him with the pump 4 times flat-line
Murder with them tech nine tactics, accurate but I'm checkin not staggerin
Put a magazine in the mack 10 with a way to stack men
Action, blidop, blidop, blidop, blidop from the mack 10
Tear that ass up with the teflon I got the guns and numnumz
Rip off his arm uhh uh with the pumps that any individual
That really wanna go toe to toe, blow for blow from the mid to the alley
Automatic tetherin', hit em in the abdomen, veterans
Can't live from the earth to the moon to saturn
I'm deeper than the mind think, ain't no time to blink
Bitch your shit gone sink
Flip you off up in it and come back more crazy then Freddy Kruger
Got 6 million ways to do ya, 6 million slugs to disperse in the realtor
A to the Muthafuckin K ain't shit to play with, got a problem bitch then say it
My intentions spray it, vicious as hannibal, I'm a beast not a animal
(remember this) 17 in the mist of a group bitches to scared to shoot

I'm fuckin at you dude, with the attitude of dynamite with fire at the fuse
Listen, man I'm from the slums of the land down under the ground
Thats under that ground world renound thunder
CHICAGO ILLA, GO AHEAD AND CALL ALL YO KILLAZ

Psycho Drama Do or Die, its self-explanitory muthafucka you will die
Some realers come for you

Paid the Price,D.O.D.,2005,"My world came to an end
And then you came back
I think you brought it back together
Now I know
There is no (there is no)
Way (there's no there is no way)
That I can go on without you baby

Yeah, history in the makin, Do or Die
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh, uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin' at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin' on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
That's how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin' at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur

Off the block now
Shit got the pipe down
Industry niggas I just got bomb
Track from Kanye West pass the bomb aye
Kick the doors down like Desert Storm
Where's the millions
I'm the chameleon
Transformatin', rock a show like God
Drivin' for status
Big my apparatus
You gotta now I'm getting all that dough
Hotter than your shit
Bullshit, got a full clip
Think I'm a punk then get your back broke slow
I'm the shiznick down to my diznick
Lyrics so hot enough for frozen snow
Feel of the bomb again and get fucked the he say she say
He say she say I ain't gon make it
The throne is my mine
Chi-town where's the crown
From the days of Capone, nigga
You know we gon take it
I wanna vint Vivian and own my own block
Print my check like Johnny Walker Scott
Damn if you do or you don't you move over
Save some room for the black Casanova
Ladies and gentlemen. You is tunin' in to Do Or Die (thank you) Kanye West
Chi-town finest. World clap your hands for us one time
It's the world premiere, You don't understand though
Man we got the plan. We gon put it in your hands like this
It ain't nothing happenin'. You know what I'm sayin'?
We make it happen. Bullshit ain't nothing Joe. Chi-town finest
You know how it go. Come on. Come on
Uh, come on, come on

This the last time you see my like this here stuntin'
16,5 & 3 ain't that somethin'?
As long as we makin the paper the hoes comin'
Suppose I get behind the mic and flow somethin'
Kanye show the chain ladies expose something
With a hummer H2 with the Benz there's no frontin'
With some ice you can skate on
Now I got no weight on
It's gettin to the point when the ballas try hate on
Proticops I stayed on
And made a lot of hot songs
Do you think I'm a P.I.M.P
In a SL5 Halle Berry colors scoop me
Groupies and Gucci you know you can't exclude me
Ladies get around be like ""He's so cool G""
No I'm not booshie just Eric and Young Stoopie
The black Hugh Heffner

Tell me tell me Lord can you hear me?
Sometimes I walk these streets and get weary
Most of the times I can't let these niggas get near me
With this hatred, jealousy, and envy
I went to church and they said you had a remedy
A remedy to set me free and take away my enemies
So I pray to the day when I get to see
All the faces that put me down up in the industry
So from the street to the club
It's ya boy show me love
We gotta keep it gangstas that's how we gettin love
Never fall for the love of the dough
Stay true, straight to the facts and the game to show

Inhale, exhale the herb
Lemme open up your mind to this concept
Then you take one step
Straight from the feelin of a wordsmith
Thats the herb shit

In my baby blue benz
Girls say dat boys ben actin up
But thats the way he is
You lookin good when you steppin out a centerfold
Tell me when I reach a pen to hold
Let me hit you wit this dime in the street game
Let a motherfucker go yeah you know it

And when I pull t the curb it's like, it's like
Your my latest, and my geatest
My latest, my greatest

As I touch this is past tense I'm hurtin
Lurkin searchin for the virgin
But when my babygurl it's workin
Let me know whats that you smokin
From the hands as I stick my tounge in
Then from the back but she want an autograph
But still we sexin'
Open back up last time
As I spit a little dough in my mind
She jus like one of a kind
No c's no stand in her hind
Shes jus like me rappin a line
Perfect let me drop in a dime

If, only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
Love you..

Tryin' to think about the way I wanna hold ya
Tryin' to think about the way I wanna freak ya
Cuz I really wanna see ya, get'cha mind over
How them bogus ass men can treat'cha
You should be dressed in the freshest of clothing
While I'm dro blowin', twenty-four's rollin'
Girl I feel like you the one that should be chosen
Tints like foldin', fingers are frozen
Cuz you kept a nigga floatin', plenty deep throatin'
Gone off of that ""Love Potion""
Hit it from the back in ""Slow Motion""
And you hold up a pack while I'm ""Posted""
So I gotta keep you up to par, cuz baby girl you a star
I'mma hit'chu with some ends
And match yo rims, the same color as yo car
Cuz you gave me a place where I could lay my head at night
And you fed me right, when I got in trouble with the law
You bonded me out when they read me my rights
Even if we have a fight, it's you, and only you
Twista with Do or Die, when I flow about you and I, girl
I'm in love with you, and only you
(Hook)
(S.J.) Ohh if, only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do

I could never stop hustlin', and bustin', and rustlin'
And duckin' them po-po's, goin through the same thang
I figure niggas and triggas get put through the same game
Get the money, the fame, remain, pain, cane
Try to focus on my main frame, get my name in the big time
Flip a couple of ki's and, if I'm bogus, I'm bogus from keepin' my focus
A nigga went to entrepreneur to get my portion
Avoid nigga like abortion, lookin' for more endorsements to put my hand on
Grin on, bad bitches to bend on, depend on
If I don't catch the paper chase syndrome
Sittin' my girl on, to kick a little somethin' bout a meal ticket
Gotta stay wicked, don't rub my hand across a meal ticket
Like a field cricket, will kick it
But we gotta stay on the learn, not to burn paper
Baby now you gotta throw me a lic, hit the shops and then we jump out quick
To the Benz, then we out by six, if you lookin' for my Adisas's
I'mma give it to you baby so get cool
You gotta deal with the bullshit and the full clip
That's how this life here GOES, if it's not cocaine my FLOWS
Will get'chu through the DOORS

And you give me that scratch, and ya throat go deep

When I know that giiirls, all don't cum the same
But Belo, giiirls, stays on top of her game
And I love it when she call my name (Belo)
And she love it when I twerk that thang
And I love it when she give me scratch
From the one of my new Maybach
Cuz she's my perfect match, never met a girl like her before
When I was down and out, she never let my pockets hit the floor
You can roll me a b' to the head, I'm gon' spit the truth, Church
I could buy a 745, but I prefer the coupes
(Verse 4, Syleena Johnson)
Baby boy if you only knew, how much that I really love you
Ain't nobody quite like you, nobody do me like you do
Through all that we've been through, still do anything for you
Cuz you're my baby boo, and if you only knew
Even off up in these streets, you still come home to me
Give all your love to me, take care of all my needs
You're everything to me, my king and I'm you're queen
You're ghetto bride-to-be, just keep on lovin' me

And sent to lock up, and then do time for it

And you can't pay for the real when it's love
Fake niggas keep hate just because
But real niggas graduate to a thug
And we pray no hate, but love
But the streets kinda weak, for blood
I look around and see the world, with no change
An epidemic, livin' crysis of cocaine
To obliviate the blacks, then point-aim
And knock our ass off the map, with no shame
But in the hood we pour liquor, the dead gone
We leave a path for our youngin's just to carry on
Is it better than my heart, to carry on?
And we can overcome poverty, we stayin' strong
Cause we mob 'round here, so go on
Think you catch me on my square? You dead wrong

So watch how I turn, when we get learned
Wit' my face full of tears, and my fist fulla sherm
And I'm all covered up wit' tattoes on my arm
I'm standin' at the grave, just lookin' at my fam
Do you feel concerned? Reach down deep since the shit here burns
Cause I only touched the life of the family that was torn
But there only two strikes, is from the Lord you can learn
When it's all said and done, you just gotta stand firm
And I won't be free, til' the day I see

Lookin' for that magic chick
Who wants to disappear
And get out of here, real quick

So put your hands up high

Bounce up and down
If you can make that ass do tricks

What the business? Let me holla at ya shawty
I wanna get up wit'cha blubber, and know yo name
I could spit it like I spit it, but I gotta be Chuch! (Chuch, chuch)
When I tip off and blow yo brain
I could get'cha numb, like raw cocaine
When I'm grinnin' and I'm rubbin' ya thighs, man
Can't explain how ya got me risin'
Sip a little pimp and let her get a little hypnotized
Recognize, wit' the pretty eyes, seven forty-five
When we bendin' in the raw like this
First seat, box Lexus'es
Drop down, like that's the shit
You can tell me what you really wanna tell me
In the back seat, you can lick and blow
Affiliated wit' the niggas in the cut
Tell 'em voodoo, that's what's up

Did you wanna bend a corner
You like I'm hot?
She gon' recognize a pimp
Gon' get up!

All about the fetti man

Anyway you see me puffin' on herb
Got the Bentley sittin' on the curb
Happy people bumpin' R. Kels

And you can tell by the rocks n' fiends
Glocks n' things, our clique sick
Lil' ma only doin' what she doin'
Like Dave Chappelle, ""I'm rich bitch!""

I'm, too cool in a GT coupe
In the mid-night blue
With the magic chrome
I'm up in the club like Michael, the poor bitch
Got my game face on
Finna take this party home
Deep into the early morn'
Tryin'a make these hits
The motherfuckas
But motherfucka's won't leave me alone
Come here girl, let me holla at'cha
Throw a few of them hundreds at'cha
Slidin' down that pole like, wow
Ohh, child, gots ta hit'cha
Up in the mall, on the lo-lo girl
Lookin' for one of them solo girls
She gotta be one of them rodeo chicks
When she ride the magic stick
I just wanna be yo homie
Lover, friend, in the club to the pony
You should be famous babe
The way you ""Put It On Me""
Poor radio stations around the world
They lose about to be home
Do or Die, in the middle of the Chi
Put your hands up high
And bounce ya dome
(Hook, R. Kelly)
Lookin' for that magic chick
Who wants to disappear
And get out of here, real quick
And get off in her good
And lick that magic stick
So put your hands up high
If you're a magic chick
Bounce up and down
If you can make that ass do tricks
Wooo!
We be uh (Uh-oh!)
We be all at them girls
We be uh (Uh-oh!)
When we into the club
We be uh (Uh-oh!)
To all the honeys, wassup
It's Do or Die and Kels
It's Do or Die and Kels
It's Do or Die and Kels
It's Do or Die and Kels

It's ya boyfriend Kels, Do or Die

Be Alright,D.O.D.,2005,"(Verse 1, N.A.R.D)
Look in the heart in the ghetto, where we be shooked up
From black losin' their life, now everytime we look up
Finally pop him, throw away, just learn, they wanna book us
Chicago political criminals like a crook Church
To the Al Capone city we love so much
But when we give our love way, now who the fuck gon' love us?
We die young, and they don't care
But the old folks still lookin' for they Medicare
And it's somethin' on my mind I gotta tell ya
My people who surronded me, they thought I was a failure
But I, appear to be that nigga from the start
Cause I'm down for my motherfuckin' niggas in my heart
(Hook, Johnny P)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for meee
(Verse 2, AK)
Guns blastin', they after me
Like an assassin, neighborhood not lastin'
They burn it down, like fuck them bastards
Police be watchin', from the other block and
They crucial, put the car in neutral
They try to school, people don't run jokes
Different day, same shit, so I hustle wit' my head up
Get'cha paper, what'chu scared of?
I ain't no joke so, put the jokes up in a choke hold
My children need, don't stay so
New shoes and some nice clothes
I guess is what we fight fo'
Children of the ghetto, reach for the stars
Never think to me-sss, cause you know who you are
(Johnny P)
Why don't you hoold yo' head up
Fooor meeee

(Verse 3, Belo)
I was a hustla as a shorty, had to make it pop off
Nigga gave me lip and he flinched, I knocked his socks off
Fuck paddle, bubble the coke, and watch it rock off
White man designed a blue-print, to clear the block off
The snakes always fill up the plate, and niggas fed up
We need to catch they ass in the yard, and shake they head up
Ya sista always struggles wit' babies, just keep ya head up
And brothas in the pen doin' time, don't ever let up
A motherfucka know what it is, to have to strive again
That's why we hit the bricks and shoot shit, when this go bobblin'
We tat the dead off in our skin, to keep the mob within'
I never wanna have to go rob, or have to starve again
(Hook)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)
Only better, for me (Ric Jilla: Yeah)
Said it's gonna beee, alriiight (Said it's gonna be, alright)

Baby it's gon' be alright
Homie it's gon' be alright
Hold yo head up
Baby it's gon' be alright
Homie it's gon' be alright
(Verse 4, Ric Jilla)
You only get ""One Life to Live"", and these ain't no soaps
Ain't no joke, nowadays it ain't no hope
An opportunity for you and me to follow our dreams
But me and my team, finally plan a powerful scheme
So we can try to make a way, that's why I take it ""One Day""
At a time, I write rhymes, and get out here on the grind
Cause man, it's Do or Die for you and I, out here in the struggle
It's gon' be alright, nigga be about yo hustle
We almost, here now, we can't stop here
We ain't gon' quit til' we get everything they got here
Cause I know how it feel, to not to have your bread up
But even though you fed up, my nigga keep yo head up

They ask me why I rap, and I still live around here
Cause money never changed the way I looked around here
You know you gotta keep it grimey, for the playas and pimps
You know you still not a ol' g, if the hood ya stiff
The number one rule; don't bite the hand that feed ya
Cause one day gon' come back around, when you sho' gon' need us, about
When ya got kids, shorty suffer from teachin'
Then ya try to give 'em a word, now you up and ya bleedin'
You say it just ain't no love no mo'
Been mad daily, you can lock us up, but still the problem won't go
We livin' in this city full of rocks and blows
My family got to eat and that's all a nigga knows

Dig into my gutter mind
A child born is supposed to cry
Fucked up in his own time
See mama told me, ""live and learn""
""And never be and wicked man""
But where I'm from, we trained to kill
Tote thangs, and all that
I run from no man, cause round here we'll fuck you up
Niggas play that tough role, four-five gon' back you up
An original dime to the streets
When God calls, a man come
We'll catch the niggas on the block
Deranged, rest another son
I done see-ith that I done
Cause P died and I lost
Well my buck, get the sawed-off
Clear the whole block, and ride off
And women sellin' sex for ends
Thinkin' it'll pay the way
Round here these niggas shife
Fuck around and catch AIDS
The land I'm from don't give a fuck
Picture babies in the cold
Starvin', gotta fend-for-self
Catch a case for servin' old
And niggas claimin' they yo homies
Settin' you up, on thirst-mode

Trade that for no soul

Yeaahh, we here to bring you the most requested song
From the P-Funk era
This is DJ Quik, Do or Die, and J-P
Now, what we gonna do right here
Is let'cha just wave ya hands like this shit
On the radio station, this most requested
Do or Die, DJ Quik, and Johnny P, Chuch!
(Verse 1, AK)
Fresh up out the motherfuckin' cut, who dat?
Droppin' and poppin' that gangsta shit wit my nigga, true dat!
Sippin' and tippin' off the Grey Goose and the gallon of Gin
While I'm smokin' somethin, faded, wit' my blueberry Benz
Flick the weed wit' my middle finger, off in the wind
Cause I'm off in the wind, got another party startin' at ten
Now do these ho's wanna fuck? That's what I'm really askin'
Skip to my nigga wit' my semi-semi blastin'

Hold up AK, I done seen ya boy Kel on the cover of that XXL magazine
Ya hear me, and it look like him and Snoop Dogg been havin'-
Dress code dress rehearsals, and talkin' bout that tie with them pin-stripes
Maan!

Blastin' the semi in a orderly fashion
Orderly stash, so the people try to come and harrass
And now it's one to the motherfuckin' two, to the three
See me floatin' through the streets, Chi-Town or Long Beach

Pimp, then I'm a pimp, then I'm a piiimp!
(JP) You ain't never seen no pimps like this
(AK) You can see it in my lips, if I'm a pimp, then I'm a pimp
Then I'm a piiimp!

I've been noticin' that niggas been quotin'
Quotin' me bogusly
Bogusly try to bump me off so no-one even notice me
Vocally, I've been pimpin and sayin shit so importantly
Rappers around the world should think of a plaque or throw to me
Cadillac, I'm the bolder-ly, binnin' and grinnin' slow-ely
Nine, packin' fo' sho-ely, ho, check out my poetry!
My izzle's so dizzle, rizzle, for shizzle my nizzle
Pizzle, tha lizzle, if you feel me say Chuuuch!
Now I'm about to get this bad bitch, and dinner her up
Take her ass straight to the tele, and uhh, dent her rump
I'mma knock that stuffin' and muffin' up off that pussy
Put that ass straight to sleep, and don't deny it cause my pimpin' is deep
I know some playa's that be claimin' the streets
Like a nigga playin' hard when his posse is deep
Go on head, walk it off with the flock of the sheep
Cause I'm a motherfuckin', P-I, M-P, Chuch!

My Cadillac spinnin', and wheels gotten' 'em grinnin'
And stepped out in my gators, wit' collar'ed shirt and some Timberlands
Aww they go hurr again, from back on the block
I used to dip up in that crib to get away from the cop
Ya see my mama always said to stay away when it's hot
Cause now here's gone, the day when they wantin' your spot
You ready or not? The less ordered, the better the rock
I need more fuck for Quik to get my Chevy to ride
So to my people's in the Chi, now won't you bounce to this?
Put ya hands up to the sky and smoke a ounce to this!
Throw 'yo hands high, light about a pound of dro
Cause from this swig of Cognac you can catch a blow
We sippin' the Remy and Henny and a bottle of Mo'
Gatherin' all the freaks up, and we gon' head for the door
Because it ain't no tellin' what we gon' do
Because we might do whatever pimps want to

Headed to the mo she got my knee's knockin pulled over by the park

Whats mine is mine whats yours is mine the flow is blind I see you
Not just us now who you trust


Well let me pull up to your earpiece and sprinkle some game
You ought to be tired of dealin with the same old same time for you
To roll with a G and get rid of your lame we some grown ass people
Ain't no need to be ashamed
Bun b is the name king of the trill is my label dont you worry bout a thang
Cause I'm willin and able

Wanna knock you off and knock you down
You dont need nobody else so let me lock you down
Not with handcuffs baby but with real talk cut a corner with me
Let me show you how the trill walk
You can tell that I'm the king by how I move through the city
And I can make it a queen and move through it with me
I can tell that your ready I can see that your down
So hop your ass off in the caddy girl lets light up the town


You lookin badder then ever tighter than prada gucci suede leather
Drop the top in this wheather
Bend the block with a Glock and a dime on my side
Pretty ? and fendi plus I gotta have a lot of that henny
With the paper to fold
Spreewells spin while the h-s-e roll
Now tell me a-k you cold
Plus ladies love the way that we flow
Wanna sit and get blowed
At the front stairway of a luxury condo
Come out of her clothes
In her bedroom with the springs up and rockin
When I handle my function
Bounce back on the e-way whats poppin
Put the clip in the Glock in roll to the westside call up my chopper
But the head was too proper got to the point where I really couldn't
Stop her 25 with thick thighs
And she likes to ball with pimp than rich guys
And she rides by word and I got her locked like dro and good herb
She wanna splurge ?? next week up on the same old thang
Kickin the same cold game
Let her know that she dealin with the same old lame
I got paper to check plus the number one rule is

When the coke get low
It make the whole street struggle
I grind so grimey
Because my ho shoes buckle
And my pants drag low
I got to fold 'em down and tuck 'em
The dream from the past
Was to come outta the shade and scuffle
Now watch the rich people sit back and get paid
While the haters and the envy had a plan for that
They tried to put me in a situation-
Where they thought I couldn't adapt
I'm tryin'a tell you..
You livin' in a cold, cold world
When I used to live in the 'jects
Wit' a dope fiend girl
You ain't never had no struggle like this
And you ain't had a hustle like this
If you ain't never walked around in my shoes before
How can you judge all the drugs that I've used before?
Lord help me, look at the place that we livin' in
And tell me you wouldn't scuffle
To get you some dividends
(Hook, Lady singing)
We gon' get this paaper (Yeah)
Ridin', smokin', comin' like we don't care
No matter what haters might say
We grindin' like every day
Can't let this get away
We gon' get this paper",https://genius.com/Do-or-die-get-this-paper-lyrics

Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B

From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put it in a roll, tell me could you top that?

Nickel dime or a twenty don't approach me
If you do, we could have sex, in the Caddy or a Lex
But keep on the low-key

Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good

In the place to be to see who I can choose

Shawty what's the deal?

I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be ""Passin' Me By""
I'm a nigga with P's
 and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fe's drips at us full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
They was serving the rock 'caine, then I came
Flippin flows like hoes when Twista drop game
It's like, awww suki suki now, lookie here
Sing a phrase while I trace on my hog road
Devine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin and she peepin that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin, deep as the Mediterranean
Trying to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin cold women
Bendin and grinnin my head spinnin
While we smokin on hemp, we still po' pimpin'

I got my eyes on 52 inch, wit my fingers on chocolate thick and ass
Smoke the last of the grass, put the duck in glass
Sipping crystal back at her pad
Now swerving wit a virgin, baby doll what ya nervous?
Recline and lay it on back
Instead of spending stacks, pimp really kick back
Get some ass just like that
See I never been ahead can't afford a (Lexus)
Never fly to (Texas)
Do or Die (Respect us, don't test us, get checked wit the tech sir)
But back to your slow lord, really wanna know about your low luv
You can stop ackin' so so intimadated by the slow flow
Hurt my feelings is a no no
Let me sit beside you at the sun beach, got me trippin off the sun heat
See you think it run me, see you think its the weed talking
Conversation on the pond, took a pause for a minute you start walking
I know its your first time, just follow your first mind
And when you lose control, I'mma smooth ya soul
But all I really wanna know...
Hook: 2x
Can I roll, roll, roll, there, there, there
You don't have to go that far
You just slide in to my car

Baby would you die for me, when I can't see give a eye for me
Lay to the side and cry for me, when I'm in my grave say bye for me
Cause I might be, Chilling with ya blasmphemy, lay low while I past the B
If you really wanna ride when the time is right, put it off to the side come
On, ride ride wit daddy
Down past in the caddy, spittin' honey in ya ear like a bumble bee
Won't 'cha men's come run wit me, let me show you what fun can be
Choppin up from beyond the sea
Ain't this some (shhh...) still playa hate cause I kept real
Never asked for a free meal, all I asked if I work coming up from the dirt
Show me luv not a fake thrill
I'mma flirt wit the girls and um make sure that they worth time and personal
Travel round the world and um make they m-o-n-e-y while have fun, gotta have em
Parly everday wit my homies
I will never leave you lonely, I keep it real for my homey
Feel, never down out and lonely, come on

Can I, roll, roll, roll, there, there, there
You don't have to go that far
You just slide in to my car

And they know when I be on, in the back of a caddy ridin' three strong
Roll the bees on, hit the switch on the six, roll the caddy wit d's on
To the head and the weed gone
See the mansion doors, dipping through house wit the ??? doors
Wait to you get to the marble floors, like a persian rug
Cow gun in the tub
Ain't got the mind for luv making, cause I'll leave you where I found you at

Who am I? Scar mother fucking face
Who am I? A to the mother fucking K
Who am I? Belo mother fucking Zero
Who am I? Niggas Ain't Ready to Die
(Scarface)
Who the fuck am I?
A born killer with no conscience
Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience
No second chances
Cos in this game no one advances
You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances
No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks
To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot
With a 357 slug pointed at your nose
Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes
You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior
Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer
Putting niggas off in body bags cos in this game you take no prisoners
Leave it in blood Hare Krishna
Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even
You die this evening insanity gon be my reason
I trail niggas fill niggas and kill niggas
I introduce the ways that are wicked to real niggas
(Chorus x 2)
(AK)
Who ever epitomise
And idolise my murderous skills
With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill
Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks
It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked
Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour
Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour
Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge
I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard
It's too cold to proceed without a block to start
Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart
Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask
Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know
It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go
And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why
My adrenaline rush on jump
Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump
(Chorus x 2)
(Belo)
I hear some niggas talking loud like we been stealing this shit
Just say you hate me cock the bullshit don't you grip on my dick
It's Belo Zero mother fuckers same sick ass nut
Drink a brew and smoke some weed and blow your bitch ass up
I put in work so recognise I carry my shit on my chest
More respect and I neglect to come up back with the vest
I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll
Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own
I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style
Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile
Walk on down and see the light cos I'm not faking the shit
I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit
Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard
I'm too delirious and serious I ain't like a nerd
Fuck around and call the coroner dig your whole ass up
Separate your head from the spam and leave your bitch ass stuck
Nigga...
(Chorus x 2)
(N.A.R.D)
Retaliation is a must
I see niggas from behind so I bust
My Desert Eagles gon to catch you when they duck
Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck
And leave they brains fucked up
I don't know why they put they eyes on me
Cos I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key
Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me
But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be
They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat
They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets
With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it
It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat
In the dark zone it's on
And hell yeah I used to push packs
Taking niggas straps and pimping bitches in 'lacs
Matter of fact this shit I rap about I did before
See it ain't no studio mother fucker just stepping through these doors
(Chorus x 2)
We can't be fucked with we can't be touched

A war without justice

Hear the sound of war
Crushing metal strikes
Circle of destruction
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Senseless destruction
Deadly arrows are flying
People are dying

Time for revenge

Po Pimp,Picture This,1996,"Do you wanna ride
In the backseat of a Caddy?
Chop it up with Do or Die
Do you wanna ride
In the backseat of a Caddy?
Chop it up with Do or Die

It was seven double-oh P.M
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib

Do you wanna ride

Seven deuce five, I ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we running up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly, 'Lo
Introduce myself
A-to-the-motherfucking-K, better recognize
Then I loose myself, juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and um
Self-centered niggas'll take two pulls cause they thinking about self and um
P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well
Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C-A
D-I, double-L, pumping A-C, A see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
'Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels, Girbaud, flexing one five oh
Chop up that paper, ho, chop up that paper, ho
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp, doe
Get involved in the backseat
That's how it be in the Cad when you messing with them young lads
Smoking on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Do you wanna ride

Chop it up with Do or Die
Do you wanna ride

Well, a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the open lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
Have them looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo anatomy gotta be right
That'd be to flatter me, right
But if the head the bomb, c'mon, suck a nigga dick
Members of my clique wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try that, to the rhythm of a hi-hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a ho to let my fellas run a train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your ho
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me, trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another B, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room, she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean, coasting, have her sick
Thinking me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word no was never said
Twista be giving women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the feds or spitting game, but it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'mma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp-type shit that Belo and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a ho wanna holler, then you a playa if you hit them ends
And get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same ho to wanna freak your friends
'Cause I studied P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically

Blew my name up, check out the rhythm
Make them all wanna flame up
Strike a match to a lighter
A message to a young ridah, on the sight of
Pimp poetry I make you lighter than a feather in your Dobb hat
Bitchin to skins, saw that
I can tell you where the mob at
At the click, summer sunnin where the broads at
Diggin all that, smokin weed until they come and we can fall back
Shootin back for the small scratch

Pull up my drawers Girbauds and doze to pros got called
By the po-po, save it for the phone doe
Bond DeVille, flossin off behind the wheel it's appeal
Took a chill, but I still had to pose
And if I pause, it's because I left my car and the phone

Can you smoke and ride
With a playa, like me, and you, oh babe
Can you smoke and ride
With a playa, like me, and you

See uhh, laid back I'mma let the proper game at two rats
In the roll like two sacks
Dub essential when my homey came up
On the same drug for layin up they holla who that
Double check, just a couple hoes
Tryin to see where my head was at
On some problem shit
Wish to be up within the party shit

With the way she was dressed she might as well
Had nuttin on your body bitch
Hit the red on my side cause you know how a party get
Nuttin but the proper cheese
To squeeze a little on and scoot on to proper chick
But really doe, once a man advance
And bend blocks smoke the last of these
Pimp cats done CC's
Heavy G's ninety-six flippin clips bout naturally
Bags seized through Darnell
Heavy sacks and drop-tops
Now look on your map and spot
Where we, R-I-D, E, and smoke


I, made my money on the DL
Closed shop in the Pontiac we bail
To the mall to ball we're all pall
Cause a brother gonna floss in front of these females
To the retail
Five double oh period double oh these suits
The Girbaud with the boots
Then I scoop, up the loot
Paid the cash and dashed past the lab or the members of
Put my foot in motion, exits the sto' with my brand new gear
Spring game in her ear
Tell her Miss to please me and dance till it'll make me hear
Get her dizzy off the Stanberg
Girlie had to run for months to pump up but I'mma handle her
Like a man, I'mma stand if I fall
And when I fall, then the city better make the call
Left the mall, by the minutes of clothes
I suppose I get dressed to impress these hoes
Getty shoe fresh Guess from head to toe
Only wearin in the do' what the playas know
Bet y'all wanna see me niggas wanna be me
Never will they pimp free, pimp costs

Open up six more C with ease

I recall trickin' pimp off you rip off the abdomen
To break a chip off the other men
But if you bury the legs - just help me carry the man
In the land with the zone again - I’m in the zone again
Triple beam is my only friend
Fantasy become reality
 and then it’s hard to breath
And then it's hard to leave so when your heart diseased/
But if you guard your grill you ain’t hard to kill/
Flip this bitch to rich closed casket - drastic shot/
I come on a mill - shooters on the real (shit)/
I can flick off the lit all for real - flipping you and still fixed - shit/

Gotta do what I wanna do nigga/

So watch the men that pay C empty off the Tec/

Money Flow,Picture This,1996,"(N.A.R.D.S., talking)
Now for some typical reason, I'm rollin' up on some ho's
And pattin' my back seat, haha, my pimp lyrical tactics
Just like a dirty kid flippin' on a matress
Now flex this...
(Verse 1, Twista)
Now I just be
On the front porch, with the torch, ready to scorch
Two women peepin me, cuz frequently I'm gone
In the zone, they havin' thoughts of freakin' me
Keepin' me company, bumpin' me for the frequency I'm on
They can see I'm a cool muh-fucka, kickin' it petty
Down with the Kango on my razor fade
Peanut butter complexion, two silly processions
Two Phillie's, a fifty sack of some reefers, and a razor blade
Like a game of Spades, cut the bullshit
These days was made, for me devise strictly games that paid
Women freakin me, greedy, lickin me, doin body graffiti
Throwin they panties up on the stage, are you up on the age?
The players in the Chi, Twista and Do Or Die
You not gon' relate if you vibin' on the shit I'm thinkin' up
The style of flow is a vocal calico
To show you with the mic I be speakin' of, afterwards we can uhh...
Go to my crib, no need to bring a mask and Glock
Try not to pass the block, gettin' more high than a astronaut
Sippin' After Shock
I ball cuz of C-Wall and Rap-a-Lot
Let's keep partyin' to crash the spot
Plenty Henny for my crew, and I ain't even broke up half a knot
Keep on holdin' me, while I roll a B, we can ""Smoke and Ride""
And you can play with me to keep the passion hot
Don't you know how the money flow?

Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
(Verse 2, Belo)
Mmmm, now they peep a brother Rolex
Fine gear, fresh car, heavy on the skin tech
Money clean like Windex
Givin' up the Ave. like a brother gonna pass up the ""Ho Check""?
Ho flexin' on the avenue, laid back sippin' a half a brew
So I see if I can have a fruit
A creep show acts a ho, when she thinkin bout me havin you
She laughin' too, and pass a few, B's around
Smokin trees til' the leaves come down
Should be callin' dame skeezer now, show em the paper
They be caught up at your crib with they pants'es down
But money maker want a triple take
Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight
See him ridin in the C-A, D-I, double-L, bumpin' A-C, always
Stackin' paper in tall ways
Pull 'em off the small ways
Waitin' for the ho's in clothes, and I'm supposed to be, all day
Parlay, parlay, in the door, that's how the money flow

Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
Don't you know...

Bend the block with the indo, blowin' out the window
Rolex on my side door, laid back in the slow flow
Gettin' paid as the night go
I see some fly ho, tell me where you crib at?
Where's the place we can get back?
Hit you on the phone, see if you all alone
So we can get it on, baby just kick back
Swiggin' brews and Perregnon
Thick chick with D magazines, bangin'
AK (to where) to the pen
And to tell all my niggas to keep it strong
They ain't got long (to what) to see
Where the niggas seein kick it where a nigga kick it
But where I go, Cadillac to the show
Po Pimp, fuck the dough, hit the stage and become wicked
Get the money and ride out, go back to the hide-out
Take a woman to the bed and spread them thighs out
I'mma pull my surprise out
Then my boys just slide out, but two girls were chasin'
Gettin' paid in Chicago, been doin' this since the nine-oh
Comin' up, put it up, on fine ho's
Let the money flow

Never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit
Then We dip through the Chi, in a truck like a Lexus
Rollin' blunts, while ya bobbin' ya head to the censorship
While you waitin' for the next hit
Motherfucka makin' money just wanted to take a look at the Mid-West
Put my color in
Spend my money in the Souther-an
Motherfuckas steady stutterin', but I'mma come from the heart for start

Paper chase, I'm on a motherfuckin' paper chase
(Verse 1, Belo)
I need.. Mo money, mo money mo! Some cum fast, some cum slow
Even though I got to pay my bills
I'm still on the streets tryina keep it real
Pass this B, let me take a hit
Hopin this money ain't counterfeit
Give 'em two, and let 'em go and see lyin' the middle of the twenty's so
Cuff that money, and lets be up
What'chu wanna ride, the Benz or the truck?
Bag up, get on the runway, cuz more Sunday's hotter than Monday
Often gettin' trailed by cops, better get away by bendin blocks
Cop my Glock, don't stick a middle finger up my ass, known to blast
Keep me down, where I'm from, I'm known to clown
Get a dub, off it now go get a sack, I'm back to a black
Acheive it, leave it, thug and a ashtray
More to the fact I'm back to the scene
Let the window down, and let all the smoke out (let all the smoke out)
And if Luke coulda broke out
Gotta make more stacks of these, so its eaz' for a brotha to breeze
Ain't splittin' cheese wit a freak, wanna trick off so pick off the lame in the game
Get'cha sick off the man who point the blame
Still a, P-O, P-I, M-P, we be, P-A, P-E-R, chase

(Verse 2, AK)
You see my ninth Mom smokin', money scopin' 'tween my fo
With open arms when my opposition, my mission it's to paperchase
So when you face to face: mom and dollar, keep from the streets
Hit the joints like hollow-point
Figure, if you owe them, better load them
With po-po corruption on the phone double 1-9-1-87, with
A couple of zeros
I'm sittin' there makin' dollars
Verse 2 G, make a nigga wanted to holler
Back to the streets again, but a nigga wanna go there
The game didn't treat me so fair
Crucial, in neutral, all eyes on me, I'm brutal
Choppin' up that paper like you know
Gotta clique, since I call them blue notes
Shippin' that paper from Earth to Pluto
Get that new song
Nineteen ninety-six, we be paperchasin'
(Hook)
(Verse 3, N.A.R.D.S.)
Check the paper like an entrepreneur
Had dreams about runnin' the Ford Explorer
Four G's in my house from here to Florida
Nigga want cheese, but nigga want more
Bumpin' all the good shit cause all the good shit makes
You forget about the bad bitch
Now you make a nigga match wits
Never want what I never had, cause I never had shit
The basketball, the all, the ounce, bounce, A to the motherfucking K
I smoke the B but they keep on calling me
And they wantin' my apology
And they fall, and see it's unexplainable, how money's unattainable
If you play in this game
So nigga never call me names when I aim the gun but holler: ughh
A to the motherfucking K, with a motherfucking spraaay-yay-yay
A to the motherfucking K, with a spraaay-yay-yay
See a nine-to-five keep your ass out the line-up
Why don't you keep the double-time up, pimp keep them lines up
Help 'em talk to shiner
(Verse 4, Twista)
Ya lookin' at the best win
The paper chase be for me?
Cuz you got blessed in with an eighth of a ki?
Niggas be creepin', comin' up, or confiscate, you ate?
And let you suffer to your fate with three
Bullets to the chest, put your body to rest
If you dont peep game, goin' for the g-stacks
Never re-lax, re-act! 
Don't give away too many free packs
And check ya ho to see how she act
Get in the sick dreams, paid, you don't pick teams
In a room full of dick fiends
Much love to thugs, that sacrifice they life
And get greens for they two for fifteens
What the shit means? Is you bitches better save your breath
Cuz you can count how many days is left
Let the weed smoke blaze my chest, until I'm laid to rest
A motherfucka gon' be paid til' death
Because I'm goin' on a paper chase

Intro/Chorus:
The last thing that I saw was when he cried
Shot him in the face and walked away before he died
(repeat 4X)
Verse One:
I'm pacin the flo' with the fo'-pound
Visualizin graphics while he talkin, givin me the low down
My nigga went away in ninety-three and died instantly
Now I'mma show the nigga you kilt and what he meant to me
I put his photos in my fo'-do'
I know where the nigga be kickin it at
Me at him poppin it at the same ho
My conversation be on royalties
She loyal to me, and I'mma get her to kill the nigga for me
Uhh, it seems his life is in my hands
And I don't plan to let it slip through the way you kilt him
I'mma kill you
Despite the fact that I've been shot before
As long as I get this bitch-ass nigga I don't mind, dyin, so
Take the lock off the pound like a pro
Grab an extra clip make sure I don't come short
Pull up and mad dog his whole crib
Hocus pocus motherfucker I'm in your face with this hot steel
The thrill to kill is unbearable
I told the bitch to close her eyes
Send up the roots give something terrible
The ultimate payback is revenge
TNT and cement shoes, plus the way he went was cool!
Seventeen shots, top hip-hop
Fuck, the world, cause the world fuckin you
That's how we serves on this late night
Pump pump chump chump rump pump fools stay tight
Chorus
Verse Two:
Now who the fuck I suppose to follow?
Is it them honkies in the White House
Or that nigga drinkin out that forty bottle?
Either way it goes, I'm eager to bloodshed
I'm catchin one plus one equals two to the forehead
Career was callin alcohol was chemically made to wrap us
So when I swab, the neighborhood crab is where he left us
On the street, the mud was wiped from who survived
He wanted me dead, cold red and blood he had to die
Slapped that ass with this Mac-10
It's just so hard when you depart, make that chest do a backbend
Bend back easy to the liquor sto'
Cut me a four-oh, and up a four-five on this Korean ho
Cuff the loot and bit one slowly
Reverse my coat plus half a block I done some dirt
Dem a knows me
There's no endin for this madness
I had the situation turnin till I started drinkin this mad shit
Now there's a hole in this bucket (in this bucket)
In the chick I had to stick for the lick, fuck it
Crack the fo' and drunk it boldly
All the boys was tailin behind me, but they didn't even knows me
So then they hit the blue lights, I bent the U right
Zipped past the red light, and it became a motherfuckin street fight
Chorus
Verse Three:
Altitude, a level where a nigga show no gratitude
More like attitude
Hands on pumps, bodies in trunks
Victim face down, in that trunk rum-pum, pum pum
My mission to decease individuals
When night falls I crawl like black widows
With barrels in the middle
Blaow, cause I like to move the crowd
Watch em turn cold as they bodies pile
Evaporate like lightning as fast as fuck
A small armed tec hit like an eighteen wheeler truck
Put his head in his hands, cause I don't give no fuck
Ashes to ashes and bust when I must
Cackling these bodies, that I've turned to dust
Six million ways to die, one more is a plus
I revolve like revolvers, and answer all challenge
SOS cut your ass off better

When the nights on
You body disappear into a dark zone - it on
Im mad dogging you crib with my chrome
Tapping yo phones at home
Leave yo kids all alone - they gone
Smoked 'em from 'em blunts to leaves
Nobody want to fuck with the
Im on some pipe bomb type shit - pull up with the
The editor (and I) - eliminate my competitor
Time to feel the wrath of full-blooded predator
So in my head I'm on back tracking niggas
Subtracting niggas - I'm about to figure - who react with triggers
Bi-ach it up to you who react the quickest
I'm sending yo partner ransom notes
Explaining who on shit list
Cause all we represent is hit list
So remember this
In my fucking city it's kill or be killed

K- I - L - L or I'll be (x3)
Kill or be killed
I'mma take a life quick as I take a breath
And I ain't accepting this bullshit
I'm livin just like I ain't accepting death
Preconception left you son-of-bitch you stuck
Hit you with this thang - on the tock with a name - cause a killa just buck
Never wire me up - the center of yo essence past to file me up
It a be plenty mo' crimes sprees and pourin me swigs
A nigga just got fuck up
Visualize a fly gettin smashed by a batter ram
Put it in da frame Nigeroe get the picture who I am
(Who it is)
Below muthafukin zero Cooler than that wind when you hit that corner bitch
So don't fuck with me ho - cause we know
How drama calculate - testing out niggas fate
Keep yo head straight - avoiding that dead weight - shit up out the gate
I often feel when shit get drastic
I'mma make a motherfucka notice my production of these closed caskets
Fucked up get blasted - since preschool on some bad shit
Your first and last pick - its kill or be killed on you bastards

Seventeen in the mist - double you - distribute bitches is scarred to shoot
Muthafucka done retracute - plus bleed the few -but I gotta execute
When I'm next to you - automatic murder tactic become invincible
It seems you know - lay it down motherfucka - that how you know
You finst to go - you bitches know - tamper with a nigga - jag off
In the lead off - get you blast off - in a Red Cross - hit the Feds off
Cause your heads off - looking for the head bone - stepping over boundaries
Its sounds to me - picture nigga surrounding me - on dummy shit
But we can ball on the funny shit - a nigga body in the hollow tips
With extra clips -shit- unload with the four pound
And I throw down - show down
Finna flow down - you toe' down
Now I gotta finish the job - if I wanna cover low ground
Since I'm low down
I'm maddog release these fifteens from this waist
Yelp hit - smoke pound - nigga slow down
So when I hit ya with the ra-ta-tat-
Take the game - remain the pain
Smoke the weed - make the G's
Tame the strain - sixteen with an L
Gotta get away tonight - no blue and white
No bitch will do ya right
Shut 'em down stay true for life
Vause its you for life - and I'mma choose ya life
Have a feelin lay the body turning blue tonight
Muthafucka you die
Sixteen in the clip one in my motherfuckin chamber
Loco ass nigga - going through spells of anger - you can anail the danger
I'm feening the snaps so call me a hype for the static I'm icning
My brain recycling havoc
Son-of-a bitch I'm psycho dramatic
But I think I'm cursed with more than this evil shit
I can take you back to some mid-evil shit
But guess what weapons we gone pick
It all be more than a man can imagine having -- damn-it
Seventeen hot ones at yo skin grabbin worse than (??) stabbing
See my workout drama and my room is tatted
And I'm surrounded by triple darkness so dont (?) I take this drastic
Be more than disasterist
When I'm grabbin that black mask and that magazine
Cat and da back
Giving they ass some plastic fist
See my papa told me punking 'em out won't do no damn good
Fucking with yo manhood
You handle it where that man stood, so dont ask me
If I'm of a piece a piece of pussy and a piece of fucking steel

Oh I suppose they sayin' fuck the ho
But they don't know Beelow gonna take this Glock and introduce it through

But how in the fuck would I let you, if i ain't let no other mothafucka take it
So I'm taking packs like I was off the shit
Nigga he balled a fist the one on the right came with a swing so I can toss the bitch
Lesson 3 put on sheet so they can take em off
A real killa and although I know his dick is soft

In the city of Chi where mothafuckas born to clown
Go pound for pound and mess with clip lets go to war

Coming at my birds you get what the fuck you deserve
An empty tip with no customers in your gang ways
Could avoid that shit and still be out here getting paid
You let a nigga from that joint run your fucking life
You tell em this it's you that got to pay the price
So save your life you got a betta chance to relocate
Make one mistake Ima send you to that resting place
Start having bad dreams waking up in the mad scenes
Fuck with this killa I don't think you know what it means
This shit I die for shit I make you cry for
He ain't such you shit but it's the same nigga you lied for
Ain't this some shit took ya life with 4 rounds
Take over ya spot and now we got to shut em down
Some bitch be claiming sets
Now striping em down with shit to do for niggas
You can't be ture with a nigga so what you do for niggas is come clean
And I'll be flipping through the bud and holsters
Search all the working with all with working with no love and pop that ass with one slug, ugh
It's getting outta hand cuz you fucking with some idle I'll have it all
So that they ready to fall and put some names across the wall
How do it feel when you fucking with those veterans
They told the men shut down his body now we back again
What's about to take place will make you vomit in your own hands
You and all men momma say stay outta the business of grown man
The choice was yours and now your funeral in 4 days
Got nigga from the old days who kill in cold ways
We giving em work and now they wanna bring it to the tape
Mothafuck your name mothafuck your reputation

Another One Dead and Gone,Picture This,1996,"Just another one dead and gone (4x)
A year from now, where will I be? Will I get blasted?
I picture myself in a crime house filled with roses on my casket
All my family and friends at the funeral wiping their tears away
Mother screaming, ""wake up,"" I'm just resting 'til another day, she falls away
My kids are so confused 'cause their daddy's gone, left alone
Singing ""It's So Hard To Say Goodbye"" at the funeral home, whats going on?
Four nights and a rainy day to the cemetery
Family be home, they supposed to comfort mama
Sees her baby buried, oh she's scared
But I'm asking, ""Lord, is it meant for me to die this way?
Will I live by your word to see a brighter day?""
Catch a slug to the head from the infrared
Wondered about the bread, wondered right away
Is it time to pay? Visualize being gunned down
Mama told me to pass and run from the clan
Didn't know then what I know now
Chorus: Just another one dead and gone (4x)
Lights flashing, guns blasting, nigga assassin
You asking how long I'm lasting when a nigga be blasting
Negro mean they're the negro
It's 1-8-7 on some cops 'cause nigs know
It's all about drama, save it for my mama
I'ma tell her when next summer comes, I'ma be a crack seller
But peep it: here go my fucking choices, shit
A nigga knowing he got a chance to put his voice in it
He'll be like, ""Nigga decide what your life is like""
You gotta be dealing or selling some fucking dope just to earn some fucking stripes
She said don't go, but the flow wouldn't help your homie get off his kilo
Course then half the neighborhood watching your ass on a TV show like America's Most Wanted
Well, what the fuck they want me for, except to fight their wars?
But I'm a young nigga with potential
Shooting game and shooting niggas, that's all fundamental
Drug houses and some other drug houses and pimps are going to jail for other people's ounces
While he out free, your boat sinks
Sit here, three months and a couple of Soul Trains to help you think
(Now how you gonna get over that shit?
I don't know nigga...)
Just another one dead and gone (4 times)
I see an image in the sky, is it me?
I can't believe my soul would ever die
So please God, tell me why
Have I not committed murder? Did I commit a sin?
Have I broke any one of your laws? Shall I repent?
Oh, is it too late to go wish my family farewell?
Before I continue to my journey, know whether its heaven or hell
All they have is my picture, my beloved memories
And still rejoicing upon the times, the ways I used to be
A pleasant thing I gave to keep them happy
I knew white castles never just like my pappy
Help this death is coming at me
And they let my soul slowly die
'Cause all the wrong that I've done to keep my mama crying so much longer
And if I could return, I'd read the Book of Revelations
Look at what I'm facing, a no-win situation
I guess this world will come to, lord
So let my peers know for them, I shed no tears
What hurts the most is when a brother falls
I could see my mama balling up and family and friends saying kill 'em all
Talk, big or small, ain't no reason for this homicide
Money, women, and pride took another brother for his life
If you really want to fight, put the straps down, stand firm
Go toe-to-toe, see who survives in this last round
Last down so walk away, looks like you lost
For the ones who boast, what's the outcome of this holocaust?
Drive-by on retaliation, Glock infrared
Miss your opponent by an inch, and hit the babies head
The babies dead, an innocent victim, did you shoot to kill?
Because the man is live and gone, and the baby's still
My mama told me that I was a badass
But to show my fast past, nah, I never listened to that bullshit
But the bullshit could have saved me from them three rounds
Didn't know then what I know now
Attached to my advisements, unaware of all this high-tech shit
I lost my daddy in '92 from a drunk driver
And it seems the only thing it did was made me get higher
My oldest brother in the funeral home with shackles on
In '93 we took the ride and lost payin a ton

Search Warrant,Picture This,1996,"{FIRST VERSE}
This house been raided  for several times, been watchin' my every move, cause all the (worka's got dope on the lines?) They lettin' 'em ride, they enter my place without a Search Warrant, and toss all my shit around, today found out there was a warrant
The President Kingpin wantin' to label me, try to de-stable me, my lawyer enable me to stay out this system for the next two centuries, it's meant to be, (can't sentence me?)
So I made my privacy, I got several lawsuits for several blue suits, any one of them touch me, I'ma kill 'em all and you'll troops
Surrounds me, (?)
To the Lamborghini, never see me, be me, never. Clever than Simpson's lawyers, hear the sentence in the foyer, I'll be out the courtroom before they holla' orda', orda', orda', nigga
I bend one easy to the driveway fo' Friday, cock back my nine baby, just to see my lady
As I undress to take a shower for half an hour, thinking about this money that brought me power, and all the deals that went sour
Plus, hop out the shower as I feed on, steak what I eat, lead on to the bedroom to get my knob polished
And when I acknowledge was in the room and I assume anotha' drug bust, I hear the door crush, the dogs rush, good Lord its Fed up, fuck!
Unload my nine and shot them dogs up, ATF threw my walls up there's no one I can call up, big balla'
Search Warrant, put they guns in my face, took me to an unknown place as they began to shoot I says my grace

July 16th I'm at the crib playin' in my stack, ain't handled no (?) since '92 when I always kept my strap
Knock at the wood, I grab my good because I'm sick on bidness, two blacks in suits with magazines I figured Jehovah's witness
Ran to the door rushed to the floor and now I'm pounded on, routinely beaten with the flashlight and asounded on
I manage to hustle in the tussle and quickly grab my shit, it's '96 I ain't done no murda' who dey fuckin' wit'
Furniture tossed from head to toe, what they lookin' for, stopped servin' that product, pistol legal, who I'm tooken for?
They said I was wanted for First Degree but there's no paper with ink on it, I know my rights, betta' call my lawya, make dem bitches think on it
I ain't done no murda', I ain't been in trouble since two years probation, didn't read no rights just roughed me, cuffed me straight down to the station
Now I'm locked in the cell, already post my bail, fifty G's from the street now I'm set free, if I'm found guilty in this verdict, I'ma fled to a country

December 9th is all about bailin', nigga where you dwellin', with the CPG and the CPD don't wanna see black males stack mail and
The only reason I'm strapped cause I'm livin' in Hell, put the weight on the scale, B-double O-M, my clientele, (BOOM)

Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista still

Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Hair natural, never bought from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, cuz she know she a star
Did you wanna ride in my car?

Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you wanna blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?

In the mood, like yes y'all
Rather be, let it test y'all
Light the B if it stress y'all
Can I undress to relax y'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the 5 double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough
Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?
An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

Now I was geekin' when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a 50ball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was startin' to wondering if I'mma get the draws
Let me know now if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin thru stunting why are you running
Cuz I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming thru balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty and purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me
Backing me to a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb..................
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out?
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk?
Do you like the way I ride?
Do you like the way I pimp spree's?
You can let me down easy

Roll back yo gucci dress
Recieve the touch, sexual thoughts
That leading us, is it me or you who tried to resist
Got you convinced lost in the mist
Grabbing the sheets and balling her fists
Close your eyes go deeper than this
Ex-hale and carress, the way it was meant

Pimpin' up through the Red Sea like Moses
The coldest phenomena
Let me take it to the place where guillotine dreams
And triple beam make bodies do triple lean
If it seams that I'm in the zone
Seeing red lines shooting over your mother's home
What's going on?
Thirty red dots fly live to the dome for the head shot
Looking for my angle, strangle, you can see demons and angels tangle
Weary, cause the niggas standing near me, can't see me or hear me
I will slaughter you and your main man with these same hands
Closed casket, can't hang man, it's hard to explain man, but my game plan
Is to, is to take it to that same land
With three hundred fifty seven slugs on shift
For three hundred fifty seven slugs on shit
So I'm a tell you where these slugs gon' fit (where the fuck they gon' fit?)
In their arteries
I never understood why these demons and angels kept a part of me
Which make me murder more properly
In the zone, my zone be zoned out
For the wrong route
Cause these niggas pull their chromes out
Blowin' domes out
Let's reverse this psycho-psychology
What the fuck is this screaming inside of me?
Its gotta be, demons with mental telepathy
Catching my misery, flippin' these clips
And open up seven seas

When demons and angels tangle (wh-wh-wh-one)
It's one more way to die; it's one more way to die
One more way to die... (One more way to die)

Late at night I can't sleep
Visions of demons up in my bed so I aim with a target
These mother fuckas got my mind in the zone so I pop with the chrome
And I'm born to be heartless, irregardless
I'm in the wrong state of mind
I'm high and whacked off on some laced weed
If you bitches want a line when you face me
You better bring a living god to erase me, to replace me
Cause I can rise in the night with the Glocks
And X off of mankind
You understand I ain't playing to defend mine
I want the world in my palm when I do time, when I do mine
Cause a killer by the multitudes, line 'em up then I'm off 'em dude
Say a word, then I'm offin' you
Fuck around, set trip, hit a buzz, then I off the crew
What you bitches really wanna do, wanna war in thirst mode?
I was born to react with the first blow
Leave your body in the spot where the hearse go
Let the dogs sort 'em out when the wind blow
Lucifer in the physical, fucked around with the spiritual
Demonize individual
Hit your wife wit' the pump make her jump real high, four feet like in Vertigo
Say hello to the devil, say hello to the devil
Cause here I come, and you can't fuck, can't fuck with me
Say hello to the devil, say hello to the devil
Cause here I come, and you can't fuck, can't fuck with me


It's a level beyond wrong and devilish
Bringing to life some shit you should never wish
We 'bout to settle this once and for all
You dyin' tonight but it wasn't my fault
You chose what the fuck you chose
And I took that road, I had to
Take it up with God or Satan bitch
Or blame that ho that had you
See I'm at you
Look at the evil that cash do
I'm down on the tip and I mask you
So don't ask who, when I pass through and mash too
Do the math fool
Ain't no hoes on this side
We that gang you dislike
Fuck a fist fight
These thugs better have they shit right
Cause it's like this forever
Maybe to slit your wrist is better
Is it you slipped and missed the set-up?
But now you hit and spit the wet up
Shit done led up to this
And ain't no turning back at all
Squeezin' with my back at the wall
Leaving you bleeding and even retrieving that stack in ya drawers
A blast and a pause, then another rang out
Isn't it strange how, we commit murder then just go and hang out
With that thang out, and a dub up in my lungs
You'll get gunned up in my slums
Cause the come-up got us sprung",https://genius.com/Do-or-die-one-more-way-2-die-lyrics
Lil’ Ghetto Boy,Pimpin’ Ain’t Dead,2003,"(Johnny P)
Ohh yeaahhh
Whoaaa-ho-ohhhhhhh
(Hook, Johnny P)
I wonder what my life would be if I...
Had that paaaper (Ohhhhhh)
I'm just a ghetto boy
A little ghetto boy (Ohhhhh)
(Verse 1, AK)
They tell me it's like
The money, power; money and power
How can this world rotate without this money and power?
If I had money, I'd keep my peoples outta poverty
Cause ain't no more starvin' when y'all around me, (Shiiit)
This what it gotta be B, and every playa got paper
Shinin' like a superstar, with matchin' minks and gators
Keepin' our family off this poor table
Cause ain't no food on it
And every crab up in this bucket gotta move on it
(Johhny P)
I'm just a ghetto boy
(AK)
Livin' in this ghetto world
Stayin' wit' this ghetto chick
Hopin' to have a ghetto girl
And after all, ain't no spaces for that
How can we live up in this world, when ain't no place for the blacks?
Cause every dollar got a dream behind it, we seem to be blinded
Malcom X, he had to dream to remind us
Believe me, havin' money can have this world fucked up
But it can't answer yo' prayers, when you get down on yo' luck
(Hook, Johnny P)
I wonder what my life would be if I...
Had that paaaper
I'm just a ghetto boy (Ohhh yes I am)
A little ghetto boy (Ohhh)
Now if I live on top of the world
Shinin' like, diamonds and pearls (Diamonds and pearls)
Still a ghetto boy (Yeaah)
A little ghetto boy (Mmm)
(Verse 2, Belo)
I done lived my life up in the, ghetto
Mama workin' hours
Tryina feed a, family
Daddy's in and out
Takin' baths wit' broken showers
Next-door neighbor gave us the vapors
Callin' cops, cause we known to plot
Break in they home, on some bogus capers
But I never thought that it would affect me later
Until I seen the hustle, when niggas ridin' stretch Navigators
But, more now then later, I should come up
Cause I seen my homie on the block, slangin' rocks
And then his spot get gunned up
I never visioned it'd be homicide
Because they told me he'll live
That's what they said when my homie Boosie died
Could all these millions bring my nigga back?
Could all these millions feed children?
Could all these millions make my spirit fat?
Would all my friends become my enemies?
When my family becomes astonished
Will my strengths becomes an enemy?
Is this ""pretend to be?""
A vivid and magically?
A vivid and magically
I wonder, I wonder...
(Johhny P)
I wonder, whoooooaa-ooohhh-oaahhhhh
(Hook, Johnny P)
I wonder what my life would be if I...
Had that paaaper (Had that paper)
I'm just a ghetto boy (Ohhh, ohhh)
A little ghetto boy (If I liiive)
Now if I live on top of the world (The world)
Shinin' like, diamonds and pearls (Diamonds and peaaarls, yeah)
Still a ghetto boy (Mmm)
A little ghetto boy
(Johnny P)
Back in the days, when I was poor
I'm not poor anymore
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again
Back in the days, when I was poor
I'm not poor anymore (Da-da-da-da)
But somedays
I said I wish that I was poor again (Ohhh)
(Verse 3, N.A.R.D)
I remember when I stole deep
When it was cold outside
Sellin' packs and holdin' heat
Run up and I fold in the street
Penitentiary moldin' me
And the city get as cold as, thugs
I wonder will I come up? Get gunned up?
Turned up? Or anotha' sta-tistic
And my mama just goin', ball-istic
Realistic-ally, don't wanna do the caper
But I gotta get the paper, niggas ballin'
Cause the county judge is callin'
And the lawyer keep stallin'
Why my niggas keep fallin', victim
To the same old theory?
Another bad outcome, leavin' mothers just out-done
Then it suddenly just sinked in
That my nigga just died last weekend, tears rollin'
And I'm goin' off the deep end
But I gotta stay stong, for the mothers and the kids
Just standin' there lookin' at the chalk line
In his hand was a cocked nine
Now should I walk a straight line?
Cause ""Time After Time""
I just wanna rewind, and talk to you
At the grave site, gave it to 'em every day and night
But it's alright, and I really wanna talk to you
I really wanna talk to you (Just really wanna talk to you)
(*Talking*)
Wassup junior, I've been waitin' to say this for a long time
I love you nigga, and I miss you (Johnny P: Ohhh, ohhh yea, ohh-oh)

Cold World,Pimpin’ Ain’t Dead,2003,"I sit alone in the basement
Facing, chasing these wicked, demons
Got thoughts up in ma head of my daddy's wasted s-semen
Havin' her in the bedroom
9-1-1 cuz im not breathin'
Feelin like death is getting closer and I can't stop from secedein'
Do I run to the mirror
Look at me, and pull the trigger
Hooker said body found dead and gone
Well shit, just another dead nigga
My future, lookin weary, hear me
Maybe after that wanna flex, wanna hustle
Never lay down a bit and tussle
Take my life, in one night
Now im havin' visions
Do or die based on decisions
Movin crystal sista, mssions
But I wanna be and fly away liek pigeons
I missin my family an all
But I just dont know dog
Cuz i left another dog in the back yard
An he jab wit the left an he hit hard
(but I break off)
(Chorus)
And thats why I stay low
Cuz the world's gettin' too cold
We yellin it off the ""O""
Cuz the world's full of bitches
(picture this)
Cold cold world
They ask why I stay low
Cuz the world's gettin too cold
We yellin out the ""O""
Cuz the world's full of bitches
It just is
Cold cold world
Picture two worlds collide
Every civilization died
Catchin bullet holes
You can still hear they mamas crying
In every second is the grave layed tight
Niggas getting murdered and losin paper and they life
These days ain't so bright now
This is a message to how shorties gotta pipe down
I know we wansta weather crime on the streets
We hear the sound of the heat
And every round is takin ya six feet
I heard the cops killed you last week
You got shot tryin to take the phone off the seat
Rest in peace, I know it's better when your eyes sleep
God take us by the hands as we right deep
No longer seek for the things that weaken the flesh
Did we believe and have faith when it bothered us?
I understand that we all must return to dust
And leave behind everything that our hands have touched
God, this world is too much
(chorus)
I first took a breather
Heard a voice to the 1-9
Nigga tryin tear ma life line
Get it back and to ma right man
Seeing blood on the sleece and a black nine
Please god is it my time?
Hold on to what am i face up for
Black the night was
No light was
Willing with the wind blew in
Below, with a slug to the moon
Open in time with the tomb
Looking for the hospital room
Feelin kinda dizzy from the blood shed
Turn around and heard a thug said
I gotta place we can play at
Hop to da 99' never get at all red
Come out quick before we all dead
To the back row
Sippin henesey
Better get relocated to the ash row
Here that nine with the bullet-proof vest go
Hottie lets go
Pull a chromium free with the vest go
Just a little on the testicle
Never leaving till the rest go
And it's best to know
Every dog on a day got a chance to bring
Got a chain for the best clothes
I wanna die my best slow
And even in my death glow
Lets have a prayer for the world, the cold one
From the old to the small one
Jsut to say that we are one
Father listen
This world is cold

From those narcotic sells
Gang signs thats maile
Seventy two hours incarcerated
All becouse my hood floss bloody body's
On the pavement

Catch me in the game for 8 years
So watch my nigga catch stripes
In the middle of the night
Seein fiends smoke pipes
Dub sacks an Coniac
Helps me deal with these phonies
Busters sellin for G's that I stack
From the back to ponies
I got hommies with L's on they backs
Who fell through the crack
And hidin shank's under they mattress

When cockin Glocks

Steady use of prison
Took another brothers man hood

Up under the bench
They say its all good
But I was young
Didn't know any better
Although I did comp out the bootcamp
Fly to give a brotha seven
Years of prison teirs
My hommies pourin beers
I guess this henny
Should be life of what a thug lives
My only hurt
Maybe won't be my last
But heres a tip for these cops
Next time Im goin out with a blast
So if you look up in this black man's

We livin' for today
We might not make it to tomarrow
Bore in your heart
Or insides hollow
If you wit me take a swallow
We drink from the same bottle
We share the same pain
This ain't a fair game

To use tools
To come and get me

Wanna share it, say it to Your Majesty
Stop it Dunn cause you're killin me
Picture me ballin, niggas ain't ready
Straight get jiggy when I rock the party
Got the audacity to wanna battle with me
But them skills you posess you could never compete
Watch this low right here, fools like honey
Had that body shakin from your head to feet
Chickenheads comin up, Elmo's can't see
Started a fire, but I'mma bring the heat
Make it hot non-stop
From the door to the rooftop
Papi don't stop til these haters drop
And we cop the drop-top to floss at the hot-spot
Niggas better grab ahold cause when the sun explode
To grab your soul, put you under my control

Hey mama stick a fork in it, cause you be dealin
With some brothers that ain't really less fortunate
But I'm a brother that be ultimate
I treat a lady like a queen if she be livin like an orphan-it
Hit the telly on the fourth and fifth, cause if your paper
Will not bend we tryin to stick it like we awesome
How many chance you sposed to get? I be the brother in the club
That be shinin with the goldish fit
Cock-back when you wet me up, let me smile, keep it real
And I love it when you sex me up
Don't hold me down baby, let me up
Recognize I'm a star, you hit with the master, you in class
But you had to cut, there be rules to the game
If you rushin then you asked to butt
Ain't no time for no actin up, good game get me too
Even if you mastered what?
I'mma man give a true love, laid back with the ladies
And I bang with the true thugs
Share the wealth with my crew what? Because a Chi brother know

Let the world know I blew up, because I got on my top

Invent a style and they want that like that

In my early life,they told me I was chasin a dream
Because I wanted everything that I seen on the screen
Big home,diamonds,furs,and even them drop tops
I went from ?????,little red model and I-Roc
I used to,drive my friends,to rollerskating,use my vocal chords
Choosin ya know,now im on the production board
Took the benz down until my feet touched the ground
And when the heat touched the ground,they had to sit me down
But the problem changed now
At First I started hustling,fuck struggling
I rather throw bricks,steady smuggling
I was down for an ounce,7 years no parole
It's bad and it's cold,mature getting old
And if you didn't know,now you know
Easy gettin slow,now I'm gettin paid for my show

Stay Focused,Victory,2000,"(Hook, Belo)
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you
(Verse 1, Belo)
Ridin' late night, on Roosevelt road
Half a moon, still chilly, so I put on my coat
Lookin' up at the stars, so I grabbed a Newport
Ch-chhh... then a conversation started...
""God are you listenin', cuz I'm feelin' a little awkward
One of my oldest brothers died, and I feel I'm going backwards
Just a little confused, so I need some spiritual guidance
And if I can't add it, then I won't divide it
And if I can't seek it, then I won't find it
But my homie got killed, what should I do?
Hold on, I got revenge, his time is due
The pain is un-explainable, keep my eyes on You
I position, talkin' crazy, should I blast or stay cool?""
Damn... I gotta stay focused
(Hook, Belo)
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you

Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you
(Verse 2, Chilla)
I gots to give all mine, to the capital, G-O-D
Because without Him, there'd be no me
And plenty times I was tempted in the past
To ask my daddy, was it his?
But my shorty's never trip, this house and Caddy's for the kids
Pray they carry on, even when I'm buried and gone
Bussin' and chillin', feelin' every area wrong
At thirteen wit' a bud habbit
And never learned shit, but how to toke B's and drug traffic
My biggest fear was bein' sober
Keep duckers from jackin' and gettin' over
Plus we mack's in the back of the green Nova
I'm labeled sniper, had 'em fallin' fo' they saw the beam
Don't make me strike, and leave 'em hopin' that it was all dream
But nah it ain't, homies been scopin' ya all day
Now what's the outcome from smokin' shawtay?
Seem like death is gettin' in me
I can feel it when the coppers stake out (Can you hear me)
Yeah sometimes, but sometimes I blank out
It's kinda blurry tryina pick ya homies and kick the snakes out
They only wit'cha when ya dishin' the bank out
But fuck that, I'm stayin focused
(Hook, Belo)
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you
God help me out here
Cause I'm off my square
Please show me love, cause they don't care
Peepin' out the po-po through my rear-view
And I can still feel you
(Verse 3, AK)
Release these demons, secretly be kept, and locked inside of me
Hauntin' me for years, and even added to my diary
""Murder was the Case"", that left this nigga in an abandoned building
When the Lord come and get me, I'll be ready and willing
Enough with the killin', Lord please, I'm down on my knees
I saw him at ease, it's either or I'm ready to leave
But pick up ya sleeve, you chosen me to carry the weight
I pain and I ate, forgive my sins and open the Gate
I'm knowin' bout fate, you gave me love and all that'cha got
Been blessed with a shot, I took the homie then use a rock
What chances I got? Love sippin' Hen and smokin' on Pot
Put my seed into this world, and I'm tyin' the knot
I'm tyin' the knot
(Verse 4, N.A.R.D.S)
Thug changes, day in, day out
The same game in this
While we keep treatin' eachother like we was strangers
One of my homies from the block, same game in this
Found dead at seventeen, now he's a memory
Hopin' that when it's my time, you'll remember me
Keep yo eyes and closed tight for the cold world
All I can vision is the pain of my old girl
Lookin' down and don't fall in the same line
Fuck ya locked up in the pen for the same crime
I fought the world, for the smaller ones to climb rocks
And when yo daddy dead and gone, don't you ever stop
Hold ya head up high, baby move on
Cause I been fightin' against the world on the same song
Same song, thug changes, day in, day out
The same game in this
While we keep treatin' eachother like we was strangers

Recognize the queen, you come to me
But you gotta see, you're a what-what?
Gotta sign the puh-puh; flip bitch
Hit the block, I'mma rhyme in the Hummer
Better be on some platnium shit
Roley bling bling, keep a gat wanna snap it
Been well known to react quick
When they see I got a star, they pause and they react quick
I'm immune to the hot shit, nevertheless

Playerism is a habit
I'm at the club wit 'um wit Crystal, what what

Lil' baller be me, can't see me
Never get her with a TV, cause we be
In the five-double-oh, posed with the clothes
(??) dyslexic on the passenger side
Don't mean that I ain't got the keys to ride
She's the pie, my, my, my
We done came to fuck and get gone, pay no bills
Flex the mind to make the bank to bounce
Nigga bounce shit like the Dirty South
Watch that shit with a dirty mouth
Know you ain't mad, ain't splurgin out
But if ya heard me out, on the passenger side
Care to bore me with the rest of the guys?
Spittin blunts, droppin jewels
Spittin at hoes, that'll be cool

Pay no bills, pay no bills
Pay no bills, pay no..
I gotta keep it real, so I can't pay this here
Why you all up in my grill?
You can tell me about it, to pay the bill, pay the bill

Money at the bank goin' ting', ting', ting'
Love or die be, put a rock on my fing'
Make the average (????) make a hummin' bird sing
Ya'll let me, let me, let me who?
Show a chick som' paper tell me what she wan' do

All my thugs don't count, you in the club bouncin'
He goin' make yo' habit go from a dub to an ounce

North pole niggas get cold as the game get
I'm official, that means I pull it down with no cabbage, (no cabbage)
Open up shop with no status, (no status)
It's my time to spit it, and make the world right
It's my time to shine, like ya'll girls said
It's my turn to whip niggas, and have niggas Cross have it, look

Would you ride for me baby?
Would you bus' some slugs in them nigga's?
Heey, pump, pump, pump, pump, and ya'll niggas don't want to duck
Lemme bump that shit for ya', who make them hits for ya'
And when you down and out, I'm goin' make them knicks for ya'
All my niggas paper chase, paper chase
And when them motherfuckers roll up in yo' face
You can catch a case, catch a case, so I just stay home niggas
I've got a phone niggas, roll when I blow nigga, hittin' other cities
Then I'm runnin' through the toll niggas, partner we die young
Wil'in out, no doubt, have fun, V.I.P., pop guns, and I drop bombs
But I, told ya'll motherfuckers just to come
And anything in my perimeter I bomb

"Murderers, Pimps + Thugs",Victory,2000,"We the murderers, pimps plus thugs
We the murderers, pimps plus thugs
We the murderers, pimps plus thugs
We the murderers, murderers, murderers

Growing up in the ghetto
With that New York state of mind
I realized that night, that my future was crime
Hustlin dimes was my trademark
Soon as that blunt spark
I, inhale, exhale, took my next sale
Daily routine, get up, wash ass, get cream
Cop that first tear on my slick sixteen
I seen more bricks and cash and shit
Got greedy, and weed up with that counterfit
Cuz Pa-pi's gettin sloppy, and kinda fiendly
Stupid nigga, you been trading thoughts with your enemy?
Murderous, grimey, from where? Hollis Queens
Woodhull, got it all from thugs and fiends
I need cream, so I strap the nine to my waistline
Grabbin OZ, keys to the three
Hundred GS nigga
Bulletproof vest to eliminate stress
Ha, who the best?


Don't get close to our side if you ain't from New York
You screamin ""Ride or Die"" or ""Pimp till you die""
You figurin you a murderer, put your guns in the sky
Make them see em, cuz every nigga we fuck with has heaters
Don't get, stepped with these heaters when you hatin on these po-pos
Don't think for one time Ja's comin solo
It's Do or Die, Chicago collabo
Neighborhood watch you from a block with a flock of thugs
Ready to show some love
Grippin with extra guns and clips
And worldwide all these niggas know we love that shit
How hard we hit, we put you in your darkest pits
It's Do or Die and Ja Rule nigga
Murda for life


Can't keep up with the paper chasin
Gonna run up with these Glocks and rob the basement
Two niggas with Glocks, cock, pop, drop, quit hastin
I's put two in your bitch ass gettin hot with the casin
It's kill or be killed in Chi recognize what you facin
Whores and pimps, hustlers, killers, and drug dealers
Since a shorty been hollerin seeds with a plug in
Two for ten, up on the block diamond cut griller
Be em or see em motherfuckers, be a ho skrilla
Iller noise state put through my blood
If niggas got love it's in my blood
Run niggas spittin hollows that's followin shit
And killin niggas that ain't real, been hollerin shit


Better get gone, chrome by the hip bone
Hit domes like pickles, it's not to sit on
Better get'cho pimp on 'for the clips get sticked home
Sit back til the tricks gone
Then flash through the hood like you misunderstood
Diamonds over get that wood
It's all good see, low down four pound
Full clips for showdowns, smoke weed and throw down
Representin both towns, you don't know now, better slow down
P-I-M-P flippin filty
Cream stream dream, Hennessy, tipsy
Theres blood for the true thug, puttin weight in the po-pub
It's nuthin, sit down and shut up, roll like that

Sweatin' when I get up in the cat
Searchin' for the water in the middle of the slaughter
Then I call up a audible then I hit it from the back
Let you get on top, crazy I make you go
That's what the other hoes hate you for
Gave you some mo' cause them other niggas
They too slow, let me get up in that H20
Let me show you what type of swimmin' that I can do
Show her she can do it, ain't nothing impossible
Whispering to you I can go to the top with you
We be the business because shorty I rock with you
Nobody twerkin' it the way lil momma do
And I'mma do what I'm supposed to do
Because you know I like to get it wet
Straight freak in an immaculate penthouse suite
Because you know I like to get a check
They be talkin' that ra-ra
But I love her cause she a lady like Gaga
When she give me that agua
I’mma kiss her and then I'mma tell her ta-ta
Take another sip of her because I'm hot, I think I got a fever
Sprung when I seen her, when the tongue lick her

And she hold it down for me no matter the cost
Show me the way when I'm lost
She don't play no games, don't fuck with no lames
That's why I fuck with her the long way
Fuck with her the long way
Fuck with her the long way
Fuck with her the long way, Ohh
Fuck with her the long way

Look, ma, I rock with you, I ain't on that bull...
Inhale this good ass love
Why not gon' head take a pull
Couple years ago, I was in a cell
Reading on some shit you wrote
You said you'd be down forever, whenever
And this is the shit I quote
Now I feel like I'm in debt, carry you and I bet
Once we have sex, all that you'll forget
I'ma blow your back on out
And we can make a movie, like two porno stars
Put you in a B thang, see thangs, peep game
Don't spill shit in my car
Now I lean wit ya, and I rock wit ya
Got the bird up in my car, don't let the cops get ya
Girl, you been down so long
Where the motherfuckin' good finger at?
I'ma put a ring on it, not sing on it
Beyonce can have that


Bentley Mulsanne
Bending through the hood and I gotta pick her up
Is she over there bout this plane
I ain't trippin' baby girl, wanna fuck with a star
Then I bend her up on the door step
Body better than a muhfucka, low key
I remember when we rolled on fleets
Never had no sleep
She get the money while I count those keys
We comin' up from the dirt now
Slumped down in the Maybach curtain
Perfect, got Gs in her purses
Her complexion chocolate, Hershey's
Picture us with the tent up, bent up
Straight through the hood
Got the diamond on the wood all squazy
Smokin' weed so my eyes all lazy
See how the cops be lookin' all crazy
She my one double zero, one hunnid
Got my name tattooed on her stomach
And she always say my name when she cumin'
We be fuckin' on our money, stuntin'
See, we can drop the top in these cold days
Cause a nigga got a crib up in H-Town
When she see the penthouse, she gon' stay
Cause she fuck with a nigga, the long way


She go crazy for me and she was there by my side
When I ain't have nobody help (nope)
She was lookin' out for me, when I was fucked up
And I didn't have nobody else
Took me everywhere I needed to go
And then when I needed to eat
She would give me a hot meal
Holdin' me down and I love her for it
Gotta tell her how I feel
Whenever we goin' through a problem
She handle it with the highest of intellect (think)
A freak when she get that Rosé in her system
And I am so into that
Givenchy, Versace, Roberto Cavalli
You gotta give her that
Triss or Gohane, Alexander Wang
She gon' remember that
Who was there for you when you got into an accident
Or was hurt, not them!
Lookin' out for you when you was in federal custody
Or the penitentiary, in the dirt, Not them!
Only one that came to see me
Even if you know you had a long day, easy
Lovin' how you doin' it your own way, freely
That's why I'm fuckin' with you the long way ",https://genius.com/Twista-and-do-or-die-long-way-lyrics

By any means, it's the American coke-flow
Simply cover XO, motherf'rs be duckin before I let the Tech Go
You know a fatality when nigga try to tattle on me, I just ? on my anatomy ? get caught in the cross-fire, and let it ride, the other side to side, we can collide, I can provide two lumps like a camel
Fully pumps with poles like the Sapranos, Motherf'er we not on the same panel, shooting up everything like a nigga was Rambo, get a sample, leave him in the alley like some damn clothes
You, You now fuc'in with the best, but never the less, a couple of necks to get the rounds off, feeling like a couple of (?) off, you can listen to the sound of the pound-(?), dramatic and under compatible, ????, with data-flow, eradicate my foes, then I hit him from his head to his toes
Look how my niggas and bitches be tellin a nigga that he cold, look how my niggas and bitches be tellin a nigga that he flow
A couple of head-shots a couple of red-dots, niggas be petrified for homicide to the sea, motherf'rs fit'in to bleed, my pedigree, to murder my enemies, never let a nigga leave then, never let a nigga breath
Get ride of the residue and put a couple of stacks on his whole team forehead
Fuc'in with .40 cal, hit him for 40 miles, I got 140 styles, and I flow like the Nile, ooo-child
He get it in like a .50 clip, make a couple of motherf'r do 50 flips
Look how he shooting with the motherf'in pistol grip, and for the fuck of it, if its the FEDS, I ain't touchin' shit
Put him in a casket, basket, leave him in the motherf'in acid, it can get more drastic
Hitta make it go, ""Click Click""
Flip another clip for that bullshit
Put it in a row like a Pulpit
Motherf'r get Barricade? Ill pull it!
You don't want it with the Don Dada
Burn a motherf'r like Lava
Hangin out the window with the motherf'in chopper...

Your days is over, I'm in a rage, finna blaze
Like I'm up in a fuckin' rave with soldiers
About to amaze and hold ya
From the grave I raise ya
Like I'm paid to serenade a cobra
The time when I'm rappin' is over...
Ain't it? Dammit! Shit!
I think I could sustain it, and I spit
Since motherfuckers gon' take it for granted, then
I think I'mma have to break that bitch!
I can lyrically do the impossible
Flew in through follicles, you feel it?
I'm who would'a followed you
Crew would'a bothered you when I'm known for
Bruisin' an obstacle, do in a lot of you
When I flow congruent to modules
This lava's the music comin' out of it
Showin' you motherfuckers how to spit
Get on a beat and show you what you can get out of it
Give you the realest and then some of the counterfeit
Pesos, got me workin' in my day clothes
Got into it because they chose
They wanna +Try Me+ like Dej Loaf
Steppin' in my Giuseppe Zanottis when I'm
Yellin' 'hey hoes' like a tourist
Style be the purest
Wishin' every time that you see me you're as
Fresh as me but you can never be so I'mma let it be
Especially if I be in a Lamborghini Urus

I'm hopin' to cause static
Bet you gon' feel it when I hit you with automatics
Give you a pump to the chest like asmathic
Make a motherfucker feel it like he never never had it
If I had to.. Run up on a Nigga
Hit him with hollow tips
Get rocked if you bigger
Even if I catch you on the porch with your bitch im gonna let the eagle fly, 30 shots when I rock on you nigga
Black-tinted creep up the ?Ghost-Venice, black skully, bomb in and tossed in it
Fridays up, red road? fill the car full of lead, with your boys in it
Like a nigga won't hit you with the pump, rip pump, pump when I dump then a skunk
Black Tims, Black Rims, White bitch given head in a Black Benz God Damn!

Break the party, make money is what I do to a hobby
And I won't say I'm sorry
Unapologetic, comin' I'mma get it
Ain't no sympathy in me, I be a G in my Ferrari

Something wrong with you, it's prob'ly off of molly
And stickin' you up is extracurricular
Activity, I look it as testicular
Cause I'm talkin' shit at ya
Hittin' you up if I slip the clip in the
Bottom of the banger, you say you bangin' well
Then spit some literature! You couldn't
Do it, this shit you talkin' is
Foolish, whatever you wanna
Do, get it poppin', I'm comin'
Through, get to droppin', I'm gunnin'
You, hit the Ops, I don't fuck with
You, better watch who you run in-
To and I'm not finna run from

Niggas going through spells
In the middle of the city where we dwell
Someone close to hell
So when you see all of this
Bullshit taking place
Just remember this that Intro
One bullet to the face

What's a muh'fuckin' fish to a muh'fuckin' shark?
What's a muh'fuckin' poodle up against a red nose pit
When he trapped up in the park?
Niggas ain't no competition


Nigga catch a body faster than Maseratis
You would think Illuminati infiltrated
Niggas hated intimidated, affiliated be killin' with
Millimeters - hidin' bodies like the morgue
The type of shit you can't avoid


It's a never ending story
Of a cemetery fillin' military killin' men and bury
When they feel a scary individual up in the perimeter
Of a G like he a friend of every nigga, I
Ask him what do he want and where do he come from
What is he doin' up in the area, various questions
About the barriers and ?doin' no warriors?
And I can already tell of your character
Tell 'em all of the petty shit that you want
Still they gon' get up out of it cause they know you a hoe
Comin' up with the etiquette of a pro
But skill ain't gon' be astonishin', make you love what you owe
Go, for what you know, and I'm hopin'
Your friends don't miss and your kin don't trip
And your men don't slip and expand your grip
I get in your shit with extended clips
So if you see us come up in the vicinity and start lookin' around, then you know we're about to get busy
When your boys see me comin' and my nigga start gunnin'
I'mma have a nigga runnin' up out to 
It's prob'ly over product
Real type of shit that be leavin' a nigga shot up
Then I'mma try to hit him again if he got up
Leavin' the body layin', stayin' under the viaduct",https://genius.com/Twista-and-do-or-die-intro-lyrics

Kick shit off

Niggas play tough when they come through the scene
.44 cocked, cup full of lean
High top Chevy with a pocket full of green
Everybody talkin' loud without a killa on the team


They say they ready for war
But they don't even know they literature


Niggas steady just be talkin'
But unfortunately I don't hear 'em
Shorty I go in, only I know when
I be creepin' on a motherfucker
Stuntin' on 'em like a Forgiato rim, black brim!
It be so many actin' worthy and they actin' dirty
Like they got the birdy and they got the thirty
But when they hear drama, it be
'now you see him, now you don't'
When they hear the sound of the black MAC-10
Don't let your mouth get you into some shit
Your ass ain't gon' get you out of
Cause if you do, now what?
You might have to suffer the consequences
Of what can happen to a coward!
Fool he actin' like they don't know they'll do ya
All up in a muh'fucka face without a shooter
Don't know it's lil' homie that's with him, holdin' a Ruger
Niggas that shoot a nigga over a bag of buddha
Booyah! (Blaow!)
I come from an era where the killas used to
Have the hitters on the roof
Sippin' on liquor that's a hundred and eighty proof
A shot from the clip appear then disappear with a 'poof'
Ooh! (Zap!) You the type to kick it off
Then when they go up, you be gone from the scene
I want them niggas that's gon' put on for the team
When it go off they go get the chrome with the beam
Because I know",https://genius.com/Twista-and-do-or-die-mia-lyrics
