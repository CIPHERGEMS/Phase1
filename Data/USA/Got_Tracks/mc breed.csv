Gotta Get Mine,The New Breed,1993,"I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, get yours

Ayo i'm smooth as I wanna be, fuck with me you's a gonna g!
(Oh, that's the way it is?)
Fuck yeah and that's the way it's gonna be
(Why), puffin up on tha dank and drinking mad brew
Taking names and after that I'm kickin ass too
Breed, time to flow (can I get a rhyme to go)
Hell yeah, Pac, I'll sit back, straight up design it slow
They hate to see a young nigga, (come up)
Another punk, (run up) and have to get his, (gun up)
Cause um I ain't takin no shots
Like a Newport fort, exploitin the floor like Jordan
Explodin on the hoop court
And I don't wanna be, I-don't-wanna-be nuttin like Mike
Cause even Mike was like it's a itsy bit triflin
And when you in the spotlight, you get um jocked right
But your knot's not tight
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize? I'm straight out to get mine

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, get yours

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Finger on the trigger, nigga, hand on my 9
Smokin' blunts a skunk, making holes in punks
And only underground funk pumpin' outta my trunk
Live the life of a hustler, high 'til I die
Meeting bitches, getting riches, miss me with lies
Picture me living out my life as a busta
I'd rather pop out a shot from my Glock and blast mothafuckas
I live the thug life, baby, I'm hopeless
Chokin' off indo, tryin' to keep my focus
Don't let that bullshit worry me
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 'til they bury me
God gave me game, so I'm hustlin'
Pour out some liqour for my niggas, 2Pac is still strugglin'
My nigga Breed knew the time
Whether it's rhyme or crime, nigga, I gotta get mine

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, get yours

Now, tell me
Can you measure the amount of applause I keep gettin?
Everytime I pick up a mic and start spittin
The sidewalks of New York will start bumpin
Jumpin around, with the motherfuckin pound
And I'm down to the fullest, and breakin niggas ass off proper
Did I shock you, cause I got you in my pocket again
Them new jacks and you jacks
Who knew me and my niggas, when I used to run it way back when
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the pinnacle
Because of what I do with a pen
It's vernacular precision
Connect the two lines and it's division
Plus, when I add lutes and flutes
It's guaranteed to sell like prostitutes
I never had love for hoes who put it blunt
And want me in the back, but, bitch, I'm in the front!
Don't front, and really I don't need a reply
Pull yourself together as you pass me by
I'm on a whole another level, them hoes is left
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself
Goodbye, some many niggas lied to have
Funny what a motherfucker do for math
I got fractions caught up in my everday actions
Point equal to your real satisfaction
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize, I'm straight out to get mine haha

I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, you gotta get yours
I gotta get mine, get yours",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-gotta-get-mine-lyrics
Comin Real Again,The New Breed,1993,"Guess who's back
Guess who's back muthafucka, big ballin' ass muthafuckin' Breed
Givin' you what ya need, yeah, smokin' a gang of weed
Hit them fools, nigga

Come one, come all
Niggas get the beat down
Retreat, creep or feel the heat of the Breed sound
Collect facts, then attack like I'm s'pposed to
Ya boy's goin' left on niggas and them hoes too
It's me, that nigga who ain't never got caught
My mic is wounded, I'ma test it with a touch of salt
Keep a book of the mark ass niggas I broke
'Cause big Breed, can do ya while I'm smokin' my dope, and tryin' cope
Catch up as this shit gets mental
This chronic got me workin' my brain, I need a pencil
So I can shake and change the style
But in the meanwhile, mainenterain the crowd
Make moves to improve, so I can build a bigger rep
The trigger finger strapped, I wanna see another nigga step
I play the cards, lost by your dingy Mista Gilligan
The mighty mad writer's straight-up comin' real again

Buck buck muthafucka
Right at your muthafuckin' ass
This shit too strong for a muthafuckin' vest
So watch your chest and your dome
Leave Breed the fuck alone
We sendin' niggas to the fuckin' cemetery

They got me thinkin', sittin' in the hot spot
I'm straight up havin' hard times wanting me a drop-top
And a fat knot, and I ain't tryin' to hear that 5-0 shit
I'm black, and I was born with a survival kit, uh
Ain't shit but spit, in the beer that I'm drinkin'
I gotta get paid, I gotta get paid, and that's what a nigga be thinkin'
You sleep hoes, I'm puttin' a peephole in your forehead
Run 'til your toes is numb, go test your broke head
Breed's got niggas at your back once again punk
Told you ain't no future in that shit, but you still front
When will they realize, I got the feel again
The mighty mad writer's comin' real again

Buck buck, biiinnng
That's the motherfuckin' sound as we buckin' mothafuckas down
Yea nigga, run but you can't outrace this motherfuckin' bullet
Breed, pull it, they can't fade you boy

Once mo', toe to toe? I don't think so
Bird sales, and knockin' niggas out like Riddick Bowe
You ain't the play, you know the play so don't say shit
Get 'em up and find your ass gettin' up off the pavement
Wavin' the shit, beggin' niggas to just straight quit
But fuck that, a hard head can get a niggas ass kicked
I ain't lettin' up for none
Son, huh? I'm comin' real again

Yeah, motherfucka how you wanna play this shit?
We can go toe to toe, Glock for Glock, block for block
Homie to muthafuckin' homie
But you muthafuckas gonna feel this nigga this time
'Cause we ain't comin' back with that old bullshit
There's too many muthafuckin' dead niggas for me to be takin' this here bullshit
That's why there's muthafuckas in the pen' now, nigga
So pull or quit that bullshit, 'cause I don't wanna hear that muthafuckin' crap
Comin' real again nigga, thought I told you muthafuckas, I thought you knew
It's the muthafuckin' real shit, muthafucka
Hundred percent authentic
Type of shit you fuckin' get chronic'd out to, you know what I'm sayin'?
So do me one of them muthafuckin' favors, and light another fuckin' blunt
You know what I'm sayin'? A blunt muthafucka
Philly style, you know what I'm sayin'? Chronic nigga!
I'm talkin' 'bout laid out, played out, phat fuckin' funk
Yeah, this that type shit we kickin' in the 9 tre muthafucka
So all you muthafuckin' big ballin' ass gangstas
You put your muthafuckin' hand on yo' gat
And if the police roll up and say turn it down, you burn it down muthafucka
'Cause we comin' real again, 19 nigga 3, boy real again
We grabbin' steel again, 'cause we comin' real again
We turn the 90's to the 60's muthafucka
That's how we rollin'",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-comin-real-again-lyrics
Seven Years,Funkafied,1994,"Yeah
Seven years of this bullshit
SFD gon' put that shit on the line for yo ass
(Seven years of bullshit)

Ain't this kinda funny how the shit done changed now?
It's been seven years of the same old shit, had to put my foot down
Now I'm lookin through my eyes a little clearer
Cause next year, ah, I be the nigga in the mirror
Sellin tapes, now people wanna celebrate
Get me for a high rate on my contract - gimme my shit back!
I ain't no fool tryin to make no quick moves
I can wait, cause I'm already seven years late
From that bullshit, in one ear and out the fuckin other
Always borrowin my money from my pops and my mother
The music seminars, 'Jack The Rapper', 3 years
Do nothin but talk shit and drink beers
Fuckin hoes after other niggas' shows
Ain't that kinda tired?
Yo, I'm tired of that shit, I need to quit
But I'm gon' hang in this game till this game get my loot on
If I gotta kick mo' shit, let me put my fuckin boots on

Seven years, seven years
Seven years, seven years
Of sweat and tears
And what?
(Seven years of bullshit) 2x
Yeah, I'm sick and tired
Sick and tired of the bullshit
B.S., I'm sick and tired of the bull 2x

I love it, bein in the eyes of the public
Every time I made a tape, my niggas wanna dub it
If you wanted to count dub tapes up in my hood
Nigga, we went gold
Without one of em bein sold
But I'm tired and I'm sick
Sick and tired of that bullshit
Gettin thicker than liqour
Drinkin got a nigga thinkin
What should I do? Whatever I do, I gots to do it quick
Somehow I got to hit myself a lick
Put yourself in my predicament
What would you do?
Quick to get your cheese on
Makin the g's with ease on
The streets, cause the gees on
The streets say they got love
But where in the fuck is that love at?
Fat sacks, packin gats, black, I would love that
But they ain't kickin out no lick, so to hell with it
Let me bail with it
And I'm straight before the ace show up
If I'm number 1, then I'm stuck
In this business fucked
I done paid my dues, so what up?

Nigga, this ain't the chain gang, muthafucka
Yeah

I've been on the road of my come-up since 1985
And I figured to get bigger, nigga gots to get live
I've strived to collect my dividends
(How you come up?)
A friend knew a friend knew a friend
I got an attitude, ain't no gratitude
About that shit you done did me with
Put no rubber on your dick, bitch
But I ain't even out to laid
I'm learnin to get paid
Layin my trademark down on the pave-
Ment, and leavin niggas in the back
I'm makin hella tracks
But ain't no hella scratch
What the fuck's goin on, what the fuck's goin on?
When am I get my money on from kickin all these songs?
Yo, I'm fed up, and bout to head up to see the company
I'm pissed, I figured it out, these sons of bitches humpin me
And yo, that kiss is now a clip
Cause I'm tired of the bullshit",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-seven-years-lyrics
Rap Game,The New Prescription,2004,"Work it out!!

We off the chain
Love to swing (who that)
Rap Game
Do your thing
Even if it means flip bricks
Even if it means hitting licks, we stack chips

What up though, bout to put a lock on the dance floor
My game got game and it easily provoke yours
Believe it, Breed been official
Ceritified grade A Michigan figure (go figure)
Whether in the block or in the river
Like my collar pops all By itself with a double shot
For the players, Women getting paper y'all
Do the damn thing and change on them later listen
I'm here to tear up the club like three six all on the floor
Like Thats My Hiiiit
Or like a junkie with a fix, nonstop and if it ain't poppin' I'm piiiisssed
I'm the original numero uno big Breed
All I do is club and smoke ooo wee if I doze
Thinkin that I can't come up pimp chill It's still very difficult to touch with


I'm a cold piece, dog with no leash
Fresh off the streets and hotter than a four piece
Big talking, people C walking hitting
Harder than Jordan can get the front row coughing
I turned it out
You ain't gotta let me let the bass drop heavy
So I can chase feri my nig
Club hopper pop cone doctor
B-R double E-D rap stara you dig
I got it in me hella flowing never empty
The club get it quick spin it like a 20
Put your cell on vibrate and girate with it
Put it on and hit the highway with it yea
Starting to get packed, line getting longer
Time getting shorter my drink gettin stronger now
Keep it real and keep that fake stuff on standby
Gas up the ride and go hit seventy five",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-rap-game-lyrics
My Dove,Flatline,1997,"(Yeah)
Tell you 'bout my bitch
(Oh-oh, baby)
Some might even say she our bitch
(Yeah)
I don't even trip
(Oh-oh, baby)
(It's you I'm keepin nigh
You, baby, that gets me high
You blew my mind a thousand times
My savior of a troubled life
Laced up too just how I like
Everything sweet, a pure delight
You got me fiending day and night
Anticipating your very sight)
I was 16 years old when I met this ho from Flint
And found she was out cold when I tried to let her through
Flashbacks of bein without her, with me
Fucked with me till I went and got her with me
Every day niggas ask about her, I know they on her
But I'm gon' hit this corner
To keep em from gettin on her when I want her
She appear, she in my system like a bomber
Name was Sinsemilia, that's why I love her
She never played me jealous, though
When I be fuckin with some other ho that she don't know
She in the cut like 'I don't give a fuck'
She's just so potent that she know she got me stuck
Run over like a truck
To me it's all a pipe dream
I'm knowin if she leave then I be on fiend
Though, so I lean like I'm supposed to
Come up with something no one can come close to
She help out, sometimes she let me in
And tell me, ""That's because I love the way you took me in
I work better on whatever if you got some gin
So get the Seagram, we can see if we can both win""
She like that, I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only ho I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's My Dove
(Miss Dove, you got me feeling high
Miss Dove, so high as the star sky
Miss Dove, I place no above her
My Dove, the only ho I love)
She was the baddest thing I ever hit
I think it was November back in '86
Outside the  she was doper than those other hoes
I've been bent since her scent first hit my nose
Light-skinned, peach fuzz got me buzzin and chasin
Strokin her with my cousin in the basement
She's all I ever needed when I was rhymin
I started clockin and lacin my girl with white diamonds
And I was all in
About this time is when I started ballin
I never got caught above or fallin short
When haulin some dope from my niggas in Flint out of Detroit
She kick it with my when I roll her with my dogs
Smoked out, cause this is not your ordinary broad
'No future' brought me closer to her
I use the odor through my lyrics when I do it to her
She like that, and I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only ho I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's My Dove
(Miss Dove, you got me feeling high
Miss Dove, so high as the star sky
Miss Dove, I place no above her
My Dove, the only ho I love)
""Ooh, la-la-la
Look at fat, fat ass"" when my girl walk by
Wearin shit like plastic and askin why
All these niggas in my area be actin high
Like they watchin Toni Braxton in they bedroom lie
Missionary and be very interested in I
Get up in her like a winner cause that ass too fly
I wish she had a pager
So I can hit her off with somethin major
I'm sayin she a ho, I know, still a nigga don't pay her
24/7 she got her ass in the air
Fuckin with some other song
But I'm gon' still fuck her with no rubber on
That's where we at, everyday I be with my girl
Sometime I think she twisted like a jherri curl
Cause she be in these hoes' mouth constantly
Then right back in my pocket where she 'sposed to be
They say they always see my ho off in the Bay
I guess I get with Davey, let him know I'm on my way
Hooked up the Yukon, the futon, I got the bomb, and it's all day
So let's get it on like we Marvin Gaye
And so I stay ever ready to be bustin like confetti
On your whole congregation of blatant player-hation
But she say, ""Fuck em
Punk-ass muthafuckas ain't really sayin nothin""
She like that, and I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only ho I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's Miss Dove",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-my-dove-lyrics
Ainâ€™t Too Much Worried,20 Below,1992,"I ain't much too worried about the past
(Past)
Worried about the past
(Yeah
That's the way I like it
Laid back, just like that
Now what that music feel like?)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

Growin up in Flint, I went to Gundry Elementary
A Little fat kid who ain't have shit, lived on Lorado Street
Don't get me wrong, cause we was far from po' though
But up-to-date tennis shoes was far from affordable
A runaway, well, that describes me best
Cause if things ain't go my way, it was time to jet
I ran back and forth from my mom's to my pop's house
And by the 9th grade I was a high school drop-out
15 and my life done went bad
By this time I was livin with my dad
Not thinkin 'bout what's goin on in life
And if I have to carry a gun or a knife
Will I have to use it, if so, then it's on
I never had a girlfriend to call my own
So what I'm seein now I'm really hopin it'll last
But if not - hah, I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

Now my old man, yo, he doesn't say much
He works every day and fiddle-faddle with his truck
And when I went to school he was home in the bed
But when I came home, he was up gettin fed
Now people, don't trip, see, my pops never hang
But I can tell you this: that he is up on the game
Seven in the morning, I'm dressed in my Levis
Headed for school with my nigga, my nerve, T-Ray
Reached into the room and got my dollar off the dresser
Knowin when I get to school I get ganked for the rest of it
Huh, I saw an apple on the table, had to get me one
Threw on my Crew hat, the first kid in Flint with one
Me and T-Ray walkin up Dupont
All I'm thinkin about is skippin, that's what I'll probably do
But it really don't matter, nowadays it won't last
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
(I ain't too much worried 'bout the past)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past

So now I got a baby and a baby on the way
As long as me and both of the moms are cool, I'll never have to pay
It's not what I bargained for, but it's what I've bought
And if I have to pay child support, I'd be my fault
But I ain't the type to get uptight and fighting things
I'm tryin to be like Spike and 'do the right thing'
I'm never ridin dirty nor negotiatin kilos
Me and Pop Breed and Al Capone, we ride in trio
Coolin in the Cherokee, them girls hollerin ""Eric Breed""
Puffin up on the dank, cause I ain't messin with no generic weed
I'm in the world, I'm tryin to make a livin, son
We need money, and ain't nobody givin none
My own boss, I'm workin at my j-o-b
No more kids and no more women playin me
And as long as I keep my mind on straight, I'm gon' last
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past

I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
(Huh, nah...)
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
(I ain't too much worried 'bout the past)
I ain't much too worried about the past
Ain't too much worried
Worried about the past
Ain't too much worried 'bout the past
(I ain't too much worried 'bout the past)


Past tense...
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past
Past tense, nonsense
Past tense, nonsense
Past tense...
I ain't too much worried 'bout the past
Yo
You still gon' listen to this song
In '93?
In '94?
In '95...
I'll have somethin new
But right now I want you to enjoy this
Cause in '95 - believe me
Your boy Breed, I ain't too much worried 'bout the past
I'm outta here",https://genius.com/Mc-breed-aint-too-much-worried-lyrics
Guerrilla Pimpinâ€™,Flatline,1997,"Big baller, on fly biggie, black four fifty
Quickly run to your city like a gypsy
Kept a half ounce of buddah to get the cash and bounce
51 mansion, I ain't stopped to see who doin' the askin'
All these motherfuckers doin' this blastin'
So while these fools' words be heated like passion
I'mma catch end, what? - I'm workin' with the full grip
Ain't no future in that bullshit
So I pull shit, off like my presidential
Sniff and stay illegal like the governmental
Make new world, everytime
Got my shit lookin' bright like the shoes shine
Rub you up like the massage when I'm on the grind
Cause in my mind, you better get yours, cause I'mma get mine fool

Stackin' them bricks got you trippin'
Them cookies and them cakes got you slippin'
A flock of birds got you on the yard simpin'
We got B-E-N-G-A all day, Guerrilla Pimpin'

Now, now, now I'mma drop a jewel right quick, G shit
You finna get the convict, subliminal bomb shit
Criminal, monoply, philosophy
Million dollar properties, Gs overseas, status
Meet my mackies and apparatus
Known from I give the Grammer from Atlanta to Atlantis
I handle this, pound for pound, Roy Juhon scandalous
Break it down, I'm gonna give you what you need
Full balls and big dick and straight weed
Or get wet up, you know, you better get up
And get yours from the T.O.P. - fuckin' with me
Smooth Jacks and Braud Backs and Kool Max
Some criminal contacts, be lovin' my gold plaques
But that ain't who I'mma goes at
On the real, dollar bill motherfucker
Can you flow with that?


It's goin' on and on, nigga
It's goin' on and on and on

Knick Knack Patty Whack, give the dog a bone
No give him a zone, tell him get the fuck on
It don't stop, 'til your life get popped
And you can sell a 5 million when you drop hot jam
Better then the rest of them
I'm, therefore, pack the floor when I'm on my tour
If we can't make it, though, nigga's actin' hardcore
It ain't the cost though, niggas it's the cash flow
All the ass-holes, for sheezy
Though it freezy, do right to the easy
Nationality, reality, nigga's salary or locality
Ugh, the Grand Finale, on my way back from Cali'
Fuckin' twin bitches and they're prayin' for their ends
And it's on nigga
Rock, slang it to you like the dirty cop
Cluck 'til the world stop, make them all drop
My nigga Diggie empty out the whole box
I set it off, come on, come out get yours
I'm talkin' from your old black clothes to your Caddillac does
And money from fat whores, real bros who licked the world toes
Realize that you gotta get shows
All dimes, all the time, better get yours

On and on, on and on
To the break of dawn
Eric Breed
(What up?)
Big ballin MC
And E

Erotic got the beats
Drive your ass psychotic
(That's right)
(Who there on the hook, bitch, look)

Trip the light fantastic with me
And when I shoot through your city
Blaze up a fat-o, and let's go get busy
Breed do it to you everytime, hit you with the unexpected
Connect the beats and rhymes, and then perfect it
Now I'mma roll and you gon' roll with me
One Puff, the blunt I roll'll sho' get me, now you can hit me
With the Hen dog, a thin fog surround my scalp
And if I get to trickin, bitch, you on a salary cap
Big Baller Eric, got the suit, so I'mma wear it
But my muthafuckin dove is my one and only love
I can't't think without my drink, so nigga, pass it
Then take two big-ass pulls of the blunt and then amass it
Float with Breed through the galaxy
The cosmos belongs to me, it's my galery
And it don't matter we ballin in the highest degree
]From F-l-i-n-t Breed gettin high as could be
I'm finna fly on weed

Floatin through the cosmos, rollin pimp shit, gettin high
Givin a fuck about those space-age hoes, these One Puff niggas know why

Now I'mma paint a picture for ya (fascinatin)
Illustratin how we keep your ass giratin
And playa-hatas spectatin, waitin for the next collaboration I drop
It's the bomb with Erotic, you know it, you know it's all that
Fly and you can fly with me when I bounce to interplanetary limits
I'm in it to win it, fuck a gimmick
I got a secret, when the beat hit
Worldwide it's hard to hide cause I freak shit
A penny for your thoughts, a million plus for mine
You say I'm fallin off, but you ain't even known to get your own
Platinum-slappin em haters with my latest disc
Can you detect what's comin next from the flex of my wrist?
And the shit be off the hook soon as 'Rotic lay the mix
Get with Breed and hella weed and give me on my shit
This be with the hoeish shit, now go with shit that you be spittin
Try to write rhymes that sound like mine, but they ain't fittin
Who can do it like I do it? (What?) Maintain
Yo crew ain't like my crew (How that is?) Let me explain
(Aight)


Imagine havin hydrophonic symphonic chronic and lettin it go
Niggas gettin lifted off the contact fo' sho'
Bitches screamin ho-faded
They eyes beamin low, everybody on the flo' lookin fo' mo'
You at the show, feel the vibe we provide for ya
Hustlers and bitches, I be gettin live for ya
For my riches, fall into my flow like the Pacific
Ocean, sometime explicit, and get you open when I flip it
One Puff stuff, loot like you ain't seen
And a pocket full of green's how to fade, knawmean?
Dig it, can't a nigga hit em up like Breed

Cleverness,To Da Beat Châ€™All,1991,"I be the P-a-crooked letter-crooked letter
-i-o-n, and it don't get no' better
I be legit, like E-40 I'm sick wid it
East meets West, I make it 'southernplayalistic'
I be doin this without strugglin
You wanna be down like me like Brandy
I demand the phony MC to hand me
The mic, I spark it up, I do whatever
Wanna-be MC can get your style severed
By this terrorist lyricist, you will believe
Flinttown and Brooklyn, Passion and Mr. Breed
Number one big ballers, player-haters get deceased
Fuck peace and compromise, it's do-or-die in the East
You don't wanna see Def Squad, we dangerous like Too $hort
We burn mics like blunts and light the stage like Newports
See, lyrical-I believe in eye for an eye
And for them wack-ass niggas, see, I predict genocide
The unfuckwittable MC, my golden touch be king like Midas
The lyrical death certificate writer, my style's the tightest
Step up and play it hard, and get your whole style scarred
See, I be on Southern Avenue and Lindon Boulevard

Cause I do this without strugglin
When I bless this
Many wish to be as crisp
Never mind
Cleverness

Young Chuck and I makin a come-up like throw up
No luck, I been fusin, waitin to blow the fuck up
Like napalm, back, legs and arms explode
Like pipe bombs, so ring the alarm, it's on from dust to dawn
Landmines and trip wire
Cover my entire front lawn and four rottweilers
Prowlin the premises, and hop the fence
And get that ass crucified like Jesus, believe it
I stays weeded and smokin MC's like seedless sativa
Battle to travel through valleys of lost
And dead MC's and never got defeated
MC's retreated once the battlefields got heated
My projectile heat-seeking missiles
Check it, I'm settin it off and representin these Flint niggas
Street gorillas, drug dealers, sushi dinners
Sippin quart, I'm blue with a twisted lemon
Weed, twisted swishers, we split it and fill it
We fill it, lick it, then seal it
Then lift it to your lip and ah - feel the effect


Now this is bein done for you non-believers
I'm bringin bats, bitch, machetes, gats and cleavers
Now which one of y'all wanna come see the B-r-double
I'm ridin, nigga, and you can run and ask T-Double
I run sport like Berry, but big balls like Jerry
And it's gon' take more than phone calls, nigga, to scare me
My infrared got a date with your head
And my beat'll getcha after I fill my clip with lead
Bloodshed ain't shit to me, most of this shit is meant to be
In an infested society, physically and mentally
Follow through with basic instinct, nothin superstitious
Many await your downfall, so clown all bitches
I got my riches from the streets
So when it comes to streets I get my eats, props to my peeps


Look, I beez Mally G the villain
Kill your whole scene with the guillotine shotie
Aim it at your body
Look, I spit the lead till your bodyparts spread
Now Passion got it, the red's dotted, spotted on your head
Stand still, see the blood spill
I ain't bullshittin, muthafucka, on the reals
Run it, I got the gat, I'm about to gun it
Son, it don't matter, I'm leavin your crew clueless like 'Whodunnit?'
Fuck it, got me on some iller shit
Bestow upon you the power to move, so I can blast, kill you, bitch
Ask which ass MC's (fuck you trick-fleas)
Claimin you real, that shit came with your deal
I speak from the heart, freak tracks apart
With insane lyricism - off the ism

Ugh, big balling MC
That's right, uhh
On some Lakeside shit

When Breed be rapping
No motherfucker as real as me
But I don't think y'all feeling me
Y'all mark ass niggas be killing me
Who got love for you, murder foe?
Put it down like a pimp, when I work you, whore
Go get some work but I'm working though
Hurt when you see a nigga worked the flow
Get a chance, not too many can bang with us
Armed and dangerous, claiming us
Leaving all the darts fame to trust
While the white folks blaming us
Get a change, ain't body shifts the champ
Get off the pop, I got to go too scandalous
You couldn't handle us
With a Manuscript, got a pucket full of cannibus

Nigga, when you step up have your shit right (RIGHT!!)
Focus on what's happening, keep your shit tight (TIGHT!!)

Tell me what you at again
Known, I'm all about the bitch
Where she from, how she come, when she ride the dick
Known, where she have a brick, to check
Nigga, when you creep up get your shit tight (TIGHT!!)
Focus on what's happening, keep your shit right (RIGHT!!)

Big city lights, big city name
Where the only thing you know is the dope-dealing game
Makin that money just as fast as you can
And this pride is yours in bein a (dopeman)
Rollin big cars and carryin big knots
Niggas pushin Benzes with the drop-tops
Bitches all around, all over the place
Eyes open wide for a sap to chase
They just lookin for a fool to pay the rent
But bitch, you're dead wrong, you won't get a cent
Girlies out there, they don't know my name
MC Breed and that's me and that's one and the same
I went from pushin ki's of pure d caine
To writin def lyrics for the Underground Slang

Punk, don't make a sound
DFC comin through like: move!
Cause ain't shit for my posse to prove
Poppin caps don't matter, brain cells scatter
We head away on a 20 ft. ladder
Free as a bird, time to pass go
The posse break out, and T's drivin real slow
Lights start flashin all in my face
Red said ""Fuck it,"" and began to race
Went 20 miles up, ridin through [Name]
T looked at me, said (peep the gas tank)
To hell with it, pull on the side of the road
""Get our of your jeep!"" - man, you are cold
I yelled out the roof: ""Fuck you hoes!""
We paid 20 grand for bullet-proof windows
2 ounces of dope in my fix-a-flat
2 rounds of ammo for my personal gat
Killed a 8 Ball, I'm ready to go
The sounds of flashing nine made my blood flow
( *shots* )Jumped on the roof and sprayed the beamlight
20 dead cops who ain't nothin nice
People don't know us, and they call us a gang
But we fo' raw niggas from the Underground Slang

Ain’t No Future In Yo’ Frontin’,MC Breed & DFC,1991,"Intro : (Flavor Flav)
To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say ""How Breed?"" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)


There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at [Name]
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', ""Eric Breed is gettin' over""

There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'


There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 4: MC Breed ]
Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'

Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that

(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

[ VERSE 5: MC Breed ]
Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors


Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

Just Kickin’ It,MC Breed & DFC,1991,"1-2, 1-2
Yeah
My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doin here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kickin it
Ah-ha, I said
We kickin it

[Verse 1: MC Breed]
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: ""Breed, you're not an artist""
But now it's 1990, I'm servin em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele
Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong
But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I be catchin it first
And I'm kickin it


(Ah yeah)

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothin but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one
Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet
Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker
That's right, the mack Eric Breed is all that
It's pretty simple, not to mention a fact
Causin major upsets for you so-called vets
Who was there in the beginning, now you're sittin in check
I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)
Yeah, I'm kickin it

Now this beat is so dope
Yo Flash, get busy one time
Uknowmsayin?


[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
Nigga-da-nigga-da-nigga-da-ni...
Not once do I think I need to change my mind
Technology's here with me to co-sign
Yeah, for the occasion, Breed's invasion of death force
Sit back, relax, Techno cuts of course
Yo, the B-r-double e-d, and it's me
]From the city of F-l-i-n-t with Technology
Servin on the wheels of steel and we're real
And if you squeel you're killed, pimp, that's the deal
Big Breed, I'm servin at the top of my mind
But his wax is just like 'jax, so then grind
It's like MC Kickin-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, goin black for black
Yeah, not wearin a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no lookin like Kool Moe
Yo, the rhyme that I'll be kickin will collect
D-d-d-all respect, so why should I fess?
And I'm kickin it

Da-bigga-da yeah
Huh, and I'm kickin it
