Let Me Blow Ya Mind,Scorpion,2001.0,"Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo

Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one? Pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh)

Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind",https://genius.com/Eve-let-me-blow-ya-mind-lyrics
Love Is Blind,Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders’ First Lady,1999.0,"Ayo, I don't even know you and I hate you
See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you
She was in love and I'd ask her how, I mean why?
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?
I mean, shit, he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
I thought you was a doctor, be on call for him
Smacked you down 'cause he said you was too tall for him, huh
That wasn't love, baby girl, you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen

Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your ass and you ain't giving no help
Uh-huh, big time hustler, snake motherfucker
One's born every day and every day she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your kids?
How could you tell her that you love her, but don't give a fuck if she lives?
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
Floss like you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up, you heard my gun cock
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but nigga, I'ma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets, never
Cops comin' lock me under the jail
Nigga, whatever my bitch, fuck it, my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about
I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker

Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find",https://genius.com/Eve-love-is-blind-lyrics

Yo, yo
Can I turn you on by my word spell?
Look into my eyes, think I want you, can't tell
Me, I keep it sexy, daddy so I can't fail
Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell
Call me misfit, lips spit a gang of trash
Wrist glist now 'cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the doo-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that? Huh
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed, game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty, so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin' with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch, check what I've been through
Got mine, took it from you, and now you slot mine
Exec to my own shit, dawg I'm ownin' dot coms

Realness, real shit, spit reality
Attitude rude, that's the Philly in I
Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life
Breath of fresh air
Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin' to other shit? You got the best here
Come on try your luck, shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin', vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down, I get down for this paper
16 lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am, then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line, my world, my way, any questions?

Power moves is made everyday by this thorough bitch
I'ma get this bank anyway that I do this shit
I was born to shine, and most of y'all's borderline bullshit
Know exactly what I want from me, you cats is clueless
Dispose the flow through my hands like water
Heat starts growing from my son or my daughter
Eve want her own cash, fuck what you bought her
He spend, you owe, that's what mommy taught her
So hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid
Thought I wasn't followin' up with the second round
Now bitch, swallow it up while I shove it down
Make 'em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin' sad at me? I ain't to blame
Back to plan B, baby, I can feel your pain

Gotta Man,Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders’ First Lady,1999.0,"I got a boyfriend now *laughs*
C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo

Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)

This nigga lookin' like love
No doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' 'bout the rest and, and how they less than
Tryna come between what we share, can't compare (Never)
Could have been left, but when it's mine, I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other bitches couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back, I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other bitches but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long, I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities, there, I'm playin' my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi, Eve don't want nobody else
With other niggas pick and choose, but you, I'm keepin' for myself

Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him

All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver, so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It may be a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now, lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, fuckin' keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you with me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me (C'mon)

Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)

I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb shit, see him in the party, start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowin' my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, Eve the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time (Yeah)

Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)

Brick house stall-ion, think you tamin me right?

Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a LADY!
Need boots pocket books and a baby 380!
But prefer to keep it, calm and cool
When I'm heated I suggest you move
Just avoid a bad situation, what you got to prove?
Leave her be, chicken squakin hatin frequently
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin me
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin his stuff
Be nicy enough, to let him spin, I'm callin ya bluff
Puttin it down, Ruff Ryders put in they work
Snatched up the illest viscous pitbull in a skirt

Think it's a game? Just check out how my format is done
Stoppin ya shine, and I do it to perfection
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic to bless em
Used to tease me how I keep is greasy just to test em
Eve handcuff niggas but I don't arrest em
Shorty-bang hear the niggas singin, shoutin my name
Make the thuggish niggas scream, watchin me entertain
Dicks brick when I lick the lips, just keepin it plain
Fantasizin bout this bitch, got em goin insane
Oooh's and ahhh's, 5'7"" thick in the thighs

Satisfaction,Eve-olution,2003.0,"Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lot of niggas is bitches, a lot of bitches be trippin'
A lot of them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lot of niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (most of the time I don't)
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit (other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (take it for a joke?!)
But I'm stayin' on the grind (never goin' back to broke)

Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
See how we do this thing, dog, here we go again
Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin
Told y'all determined to win
You tryna enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit, bitch, and I'm the captain
Can't beat me, join me, baby, then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends, ""What they wanna do to me?""
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby, what's the deal? I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'cuz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still, I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time, ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing

Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am

They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need

Eve,Lip Lock,2013.0,"Step back, where she at, man I’m in my zone
If you can’t keep up with where I’m at
Then take your ass back home
Raise the flag and tell the people come
The queen is on the throne
Watch how they leave you standing there
Just leave you all alone
You a clone of a bunch of people
Go and get your own
Matter fact, I don’t give a fuck, you guessed that from my tone
I’m a Philly born, bred, raised, never left my bones
I’m a bossy, glossy mogul, world wide my name is known

Ain’t no guessing it’s E-V-E
I’m the chick that they wish they’d be
Know by now, do not fuck with me
Stay on top, no touching me
I’m the reason you wanna hide
Smile on your face, fear in your eyes
Better than ever, ain’t no surprise
See all of me, need no disguise
I’m E-V-E

Ain’t no guessing it’s E-V-E
I’m the chick that they wish they’d be
Know by now, do not fuck with me
Stay on top, no touching me

You see how they need her, they was loyal, they keep her
All my fans you the best, feel my love through the speaker
You the reason I do it, I’m so lucky I can
And taking over the world, now that’s just part of the plan
They see me riding in a matte black, drop head, look at that
Tom Ford shades on, understand that I’m it, that’s that
Rock life jet set, Rob report, I’m living good
Yeah I knew I would, I know you wish you could

Knocked off my feet, I pleaded no contest
Sleepless nights without no sleep nor rest
This is ragamuffin junior, down come me next
Take it no more, I had to make her confess
Sometimes I feel I'm in the wild, wild west
Lost the love I had now I live to the death

Long as that woman tellin' me lyin', I get me lungs for me line
Oh, I'm sincerely yours if you're sincerely mine
But listening to promises, what a fool am I?
Can somebody tell me? You know I love his line
I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losin' my mind
Mi notice that you're movin' physically and kind
And I miss the rubber ducky, late nights, no wine
Miss lovely vessel, the body all mine
The wine does its best to shoot me with the shoot all mind
So sweet like a puppy, is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
'Cause there's nowhere to go now that you've left me behind
(Now it's true, true) Yo, I loved you for truth
(True, true) It stick like ankle glue
(True, true) I make your gray skies blue

Make It Out This Town,Lip Lock,2013.0,"When I close my eyes
I can see me fly in the hope
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back if I get chance
Oh, I won't come back around

Yo, have you ever laid in bed and it's late in the night
Staring at the ceiling talking to God about life
Asking when it's gonna happen, just maybe it might
Made a lot of life turns, some wrong and some right
Wanna know when it's your second, your minute, your time
Sick of dreaming, wanna lay the pictures in your mind
Never been like all the others, you're one of a kind
I know you're feeling like you wanna break free, it's a sign
Just wanna fly above it all, see where you can land
Know that you can do it on your own cause you can
Know that you can conquer all with a plan
Forget about the negatives buried in the sand
Yeah, never forget this is your life
Your path, your dream, this is your fight
Victory you'll see, you'll be alright
Get through the darkness, on the other end is pure light

When I close my eyes
I can see me fly in the hope
High above the clouds
Swear I won't look back
If I get chance
I will come back around
If I make it out this time, yeah
I gotta make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna make it out this time, yeah
I'm gonna roll the dice
And take a risk tonight
Gotta make it out this time

Have you ever felt alone like the whole world was missing
And when you prayed it seemed like no one was listening
You try to keep the faith and keep on living
But when you struggling the future looks distant
All your hope seem to be just pipe dreams
And you really gotta wonder what your life means
That's when you gotta pick yourself up out the dust
Make a change and find a place in your heart you trust
You ain't always gotta take the first card your dealt
In this life only you can represent yourself
Never let your circumstances hold you back
You were born free, never gotta feel trapped
And on the pursuit to happiness you're gonna feel pain
But the only way to win is to stay in the game
The naysayers they're gonna try and embarrass you
But I've learned that the struggle builds character


Put your hands in the air now
If you feel it let me hear you loud
Put your hands in the air now
Yeah, ain't nobody gonna hold you down
Yeah, come on, come on",https://genius.com/Eve-make-it-out-this-town-lyrics

Had to get it out my system
Now I’m back, forget about them other chicks, man, you won’t miss ‘em

Need it, always once you had it
Ever lucky enough to grab it
Guaranteed you're becomin' an addict

Big jets, mega yachts, yeah, big ships
Wanna get all my affection, here’s a big tip
I need to see that you a ball ship

And now you want me back, huh
You fucked around and played around
And now you're feeling sad

Uh, how should I start it off?
You must have thought me soft
Like it was all good to move on and cross me off
We never shared secrets, we wasn't fuckin' raw
Helped you when you were down and now you got the fuckin' gawl
We used to be so tight, we was each others life
You was my husband and no doubt I was your fuckin' wife
Did anythin' you ever asked of Eve
You turned out to be a devil nigga, I couldn't believe
Sneakin' numbers out my phone, callin' bitches on the cell
What the hell? Clunky bitches one on the scale
I'm like a dime over line, you can't calculate my status
And you fuckin' with these bitches like my ass wasn't the fattest
Like I didn't dress the baddest any time we surface
Must have been insecure, niggas made you nervous
And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in
But you fucked up, your lucks out but then again

You fucked around and played around

You had me, you lost me
And now you want me back, huh

Used to let shit slide, caught a couple lies
I chilled for real, I mean I called a couple guys
Knew when you was fuckin' up, I saw it in your eyes
Then I guess it was my fault 'cause I put up the disguise
In public, we was happy, in home, we'd be scrappin'
Later we'd be naked, jokin', smokin' and laughin'
Makin' up to break up, I thought that shit was love
But it wasn't and I learned the hard way soakin' in suds
Cryin' all depressed, not again, you'll never catch me
Wishin' on a star for some nigga to come bless me
I tried to save it, all you ever did was stress me
Pushin' all my buttons, why the fuck must you stress me?
Nigga, get a life, go on and find a wife
Get the fuck out my face 'fore I go and find a knife
And you still callin' my phone tryna act polite, huh
Askin' me for favors now you know that shit ain't right but

You had me, you lost me

Uh-oh, you see me comin', don't you?
Look at you runnin', won't you?
Oh, you gon' sit there and see me like I want to approach you
Now it's payback, I'm talkin' way back
To bitches callin' hangin' up, you ain't no way to save that
To unanswered questions, to home in the A.M
To you out clubbin', forcin' me to stay in
Remember, okay then, it's over, no playin'
I said it before, I'm about to do it, fuck what you sayin'
Too late for apologies, go puff on a pile of weed
Think about this good bitch that's leavin' and don't follow me
Movin' on, shut you down, now you wanna regret
You could fuck all day, but it would never feel like my sex
Played yourself tried to show I cared, you ain't cared
When I needed you the most, nigga, you wasn't there
And the game is the same; comes around, goes around
Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around, huh

You had me, you lost me

Scenario 2000,Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders’ First Lady,1999.0,"(Mmm, mmmm)
See y'all don't understand us you know
Ruff Ryders is a family
Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders, Ruff Ryders
Lets go, Swizz Beatz

This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit
Hittin' with the hardest Shit, 'cause before we started shit
With kids I knew my fuckin' friends all turned against me
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me
And my dog has been like this, he got my back I got his
Schemin' on mad niggas, that's how we do bidz
It's about time to start another, robbin' spree
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump
When I was up North in, sing-sing, I was sendin' niggas home in a coffin
Livin' like a orphan
You bad, nigga? I'll be back (Let's) see if you'll be still here
You know my style, I'll put yo' fucking man in a wheelchair
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me
Niggas cannot run, hit with the hot one
From the shotgun, casket close, wonder how he got done

Yo yo, E-V-E, my dogs believe in me
Petty thugs hide yo' cake, never teasin' me
I show love to, all my bitches hustlin' ones
Tussle with thieves, makin' moves, second to none
I locked it, uh, made a sudden move you got bit
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit
Da blond hair bandit, you got guns, hand it
Turn my face when I bust a cannon
'Cause I don't wear sunblock, ask Drag if the fire is hot (Flame on, baby)
Shit pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop
We warn niggas that we coming then we total the block
We scorn niggas like their mothers then we wet up their socks
Red dye, escaping on the red-eye, to seashore
Then hide out and buy out bars 'til we see fall
In this game, we beat y'all, you got money? Keep yours
For eyes be tearin' tryin' to identify the features

And you can come see me if you tryin' to get some grams tonight
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white
Fuck rap yo, I'd rather be plannin' a flight
Somewhere hot on a wave runner, tanning with dykes
Blowin the haze, while all of 'em givin' me brains
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line
But everybody wanna contact me and get wit me
But still end up being mad 'cause I charge fifty
And as for you sucka, you can keep those raps
And screw your awards, my son can't eat those plaques
I never was shit but some things I never forget
Like if you spend three you're guaranteed to make back six
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off
Tints, rims, stash, took the governor off
Even the cats that be hatin' still be lovin' the dogs
'Cause they know that the double R's comin' for war
Wha

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live?
'Cause when I start bustin' the guns, you hidin' the kids
And the P is still ridin' with clips, survivin' with bricks
We beefin' on the 4th you got to die on the 5th
Like I wasn't hustlin' dope or robbin' the blocks
Starvin' or not, carvin' the cheek, palmin' the Glock
I figure which nigga could I watch with a watch
I like to knock off my crack then I pull off a heist
Put it together, double it twice, this shit is my life
Catch me with a 45, hot pair of Nikes
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or give me your face
Give me a shank, it's Holiday ugh
The hoopties in the front but the truck is a mile away
Niggas wanna ride tomorrow when they prob'ly die today
'Cause the P'll hollow the guns
Holla at sons (I feel you, nigga)
And when they go to holla back
They be swallowin' one

(Uh, uh, uh)
Y'all dem bust in them crowd niggas and hit whoever
When you should aim for them niggas that took yo' leather
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust
'Cause they crazy, but crazy niggas bleed like us
See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid
Y'all niggas might be crazy, but y'all not stupid
It's '99, I'm killings you women and kids
Fuck Scarface! Watch me, I'm more action to see
Than them motherfuckers that y'all see on T.V
And fuck what you heard this how Sheek get down
Comes to guns? Shit I'm rhyming with one on me now
You never know what clown goin' walk into the studio
Talking shit and it's gonna be more than the amps that blow
I pour gas on your skin and watch your shit detach
With a book of matches now that's when you have met your match
And the worst thing for you is to have a gun when I'm thirsty
I turn niggas more holy man, than Eddie Murphy
And I deal with more bricks than that city do in jersey
Y'all got call cops niggas, I got autops niggas, that'll bust you and slide
And some ol' 6-drop niggas
Revolver Pop niggas, Eezox niggas
Get knocked, say I smoke detox niggas
Drug program, hit the streets and cop 56 mo grams
Y'all niggas ain't fuckin' with the fam
And that's word

(Come on, come on, come on,)
Boy, what's the difference between fire and water?
You'd rather drown or die of torture, 'cause your skins of ya
And watch ya burn off fat, dog, I'm off the thermostat
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo' bitch a perm with that
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage
Buck 40, 'bout a extra 20 wit the semi
When it hit you, you gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly
When I burn you to a crisp, you gon' be crunchier than chips
With mah hand all up in da bag munchin' on tha shit
Bit by bit, clip by clip and every block by block
Is brick on brick I got knots on knots
'Cause I got things that'll pop yo top
And double R spot yo block with 16 shots and watch y'all drop
And ain't nobody gettin' up, 'less they in the wheelchair
Sittin' up or spittin' up, either way I don't give a fuck",https://genius.com/Eve-scenario-2000-lyrics

Well all my love I give it to you girl, my life I'll live it with you girl
Worth more to di I man than a diamond and a pearl
So just give it to me girl, and a live it with me girl... I wanna rock your world

I heard about it happenin'
I never thought it could be
The way he looked into my eyes
What he doin' to me
He caught me by surprise
He opened up my life
He wasn't like them other dudes
I wanna be his wife
He said he got played
I told him don't be scared
My mission make you mine
Forget the rest
They ain't prepared
He said he liked my style
I said I liked his lips
He took my hand
And then he told me this


You ever let a dude
You can't get out yo mind
You go to sleep
He in your dreams
He with you all the time
This was the way it was
Thought it was meant to be
Till I picked up the phone one night
And it was Tiffany
She said he was her dude
I said is that a fact
She said I let him go and play
But he always come back
I said that can't be true
She said it always is
I hung up, heart stuck
I can't believe this shit


Well everyday mi see you with you, girl, and a walk and a pass me
Heart skip a beat and yuh shape it a lost me
Anything you want, my girl if you ask me, no matter what a cost me

Philly is where I'm from

We from P-H-I-L-A period
PA period, Eve they hearin' it
Believe they fearin' it, but lovin' it though
I hate the game, fuck the fame but I'm lovin' the dough
You couldn't tell me in a million years
And a thousands bars that I roam the reservoir with dogs
Show the world what ""crew love"" was about
Drop adrenaline, ""4-5-6""
I show them what a thug was about
I know you love flossin' with X, bustin' them checks
Getting tattoos, paw prints on your chest
I ain't mad, baby, get that cash
Make them hatin' bitches kiss your ass
Ruff Ryde lift that shit
I'm gon' walk 'til I see how these flees gon' feel
When I come through with the whip with the bees on the wheel
Burgundy thing, cream gut, cherry wood
Steerin' wheel, or be surrounded by the wing on the hood
I know they like, ""How they collide""
He roll with Roc, you Ruff Ryde
But we black friday tied
How you think they gon' feel seein' us Grammy night?
Let me tell you, a bunch of if, ands and mights
Billboard charts, source ads and mics
And if I say so myself, goddamn, we tight
Fuck bein' humble, ain't no other way to end this
We ain't open up the doors, we knocked that bitch up off the hinges

We gon' hold it down for illdelph for life
Came through, made a name, nigga, nailed it tight
And now we shine, been knew, shit it was 'bout time
Switched from streets to beats, platinum lines
Used to struggle in the hood, just to brodie the mic
Took the fame 'cause they ain't give it us, now we excite
The biggest crowds and they screamin' loud, Philly the shit
Roc-a-fella rap guerrilla, blond bombshell bitch
I Ruff Ryde, take your mind, shit, you doin' the same
Work hard, now the streets stay shoutin' our names
Fame is funny, get money, snakes in the grass
When the hostility shows, niggas face get smashed
But I stay grounded, brick house stallion
My bitches keep me real while I make millions
Pile it all, we gon' have it all any minute
Give it back the hood and we gon' ball in a minute
'Cause anything we want, we gon' have it on our plates
Matter of time before we killed the beans it was our fate
And cats were stressed, gave it all, they expected less
Disrespect, take it back the hood, protect your chest
Try to break us but we broke through
Got the job done, that's what's up

Hey Y’all,Eve-olution,2002.0,"Yea Yea, Evie Eve
And you know, you better know

I keep some chuck's on my feet khakis on my legs
Trunk full of funk nigga while im breaking bread
Sliding through your system banging, bobbing heads
Doing mines and I don't care what other niggas saying
They can pop it, but they can't stop it, boy I'm getting mine
Selling clothes up in this bitch like Calvin Klein
Getting cuties to shake they booty at the same time
I'd be damned If I go back to jail for the same crime
I'm to slick to get caught up in this dirty game
I'm a scollar that make dollaz off the birdy game
Crip hoping I got it popping on the Blvd
Man I ain't fucking with chevy's I got my own car
D-O Double you don't wanna rumble, why you testing me
Oh I know, you must be gone off them extacy
Bad habits you better kick it before it get you loc
And try to get yourself hooked on this chronic smoke
Fo' sho!!
(Chorus: Nate Dogg)
Hey Y'all, doggs from East to West Coast
All my doggs we could smoke, we 'bout to take some bank roll
Everywhere that I go, man I see the same hoes
I know they already know, yea we like it real raw
Snoop, Evie Eve and Nate Dogg

(uh-huh)These niggas got you head nodding
And this chick got the drums from your ears throbbing
Known to do it, baby bubblin do 'chu dare stop it
Love when bitches hate you, hear the song pimps
Ain't nothing to me, Got my nigga Snoop he been down
As for my nigga Nate, shit he was in town
Created heat so you can bang it, crank it nice and loud
Can't block me out I'm popping up Evie Eve, I'm upon your tv
Ain't never stuck up off the freezyness
Same bitch, same pitch nothing rediculous
Want this brown girl I see you thug lick your lips
Gotta have that bombshell, damn girl I need you for me
Keep love on the both sides, we in the church
On these niggas getting smoke ties, dominoe playing
Up here praying that they legalize, but fuck it still choke top down
Baby blowing smoke in the sky, come on


Now when you see me acting up in the club (it ain't nothin)
Uh six fall up on dub's (it ain't nothin)
Huh breaking up blueberry buds (it ain't nothing)
And every hood showing nothing but love (it ain't nothing)
Taste buds ain't the same, for the simple brain
Should of never let me learn what millions really mean
Yea I'm a simple girl, but really don't want simple things
Keep real doggs close, hate cats with simple brains
Not ready for the collision, stay up in your lane
East coast, West coast, you still don't fuckin think
Dedicate to you baby, keep your gangsta lean

You gots to be my queen, cause I'm the Bigg king
The one with the Bigg house with the Bigg things
Sista Eve, you blessed the whole scene
You're the queen of the team, with cream, you're so supreme
A blessin in the skies, open up your eyes

Let's talk about who I am
Blondie, find me in the hood with my peoples
Love y'all, hate the rest of y'all that I can see through
Above that, I can't feel nothin' 'less it's lethal
Testin' your moves, never that, make your position fetal, uh

I wanna talk about Dog nigga, L-O-X, Eve, and me
Now that's the hottest thing in the streets, our beats is Swizz
Cheesed up with holes in the shit, Double R roll thick
And ain't nothin' sweet but Drag-Eve tracks honey roasted
Burn it 'til it's been around now, how the fuck that sound?

Yo, let's talk about
Platinum plaques, hangin' on my wall
See me decorated, she's the one
Heard 'em say it, see me celebrated
I pop shit when it's necessary, not for nothin'
I use clips for them big beefs
See me bustin'? Blaow!

I wanna talk about bitches I fucked
I'm a dog so I can't stand no bitch that hounds
I'm far from a clown
If I'm not knockin' her down, Drag's probably not around
So I'm not one to claim by either one of you dames
If y'all catch Drag with a mane, trust me she got my last name

Let's talk about little dick niggas
Always talkin' 'bout what you got
Rather be finger-popped
Dick probably the size of a bough stuffed with rocks
Fuck the cop, nigga, go shoot pool, pussy plot
You make me cum, I might flood the block, wet on my socks

Uh, I wanna talk about guns niggas don't bust
Y'all need to see me if y'all wanna see shells pop out
I make niggas say, ""Watch out,"" when I got my Glock out
Niggas clock out, 'cause I run up in your watch house
Snatch up all your rocks out
Then throw your box out
Ya motherfuckers better watch out

Hold up, yo, let's talk about fake ass bitches
Lyin' on yourself, you ain't ready for the world, mama
Beggin' every second money hungry, life drama
Get your own stacks
Why you think these niggas pussy hungry?
'Cause you actin' triflin'
Layin' up, takin' his money, uh

I wanna talk about live or die, fuckin' with I
Niggas will fry like stripped bacon
I leave them shakin', keep 'em sizzlin'
Fuckin' with them, you might win
But they only got six shots with a barrel that spin
And us, our clip is spinnin'
And hittin' all their men

Yo, I wanna talk about ride or die
My dogs control confrontation in any situation
Five niggas on your team
Five niggas you replacin'
Five niggas used to gleam
Five niggas left with nathan
But their game that we took
And now they back to chase it

I wanna talk about bitin' ass niggas
Let me see y'all niggas catch the flow
Go red-vest with the four-four blow
Ya niggas gonna hit the ground for sure
Nigga, let me know if you want more
If he catch you with a pound to choke, you know
Nigga never die slow, 'til his eyes closed
Then jump on the highway, I go
Man, fuck the po-po, them niggas is movin' slow mo, come on

Anybody out there? anybody don't care
Feeling their dark glare not a sound out there
But I know they're following me everywhere
Never gonna see again
Goodbye to a spell and the night coming to an end
Go beyond past a fence longing to know
What's out there for me
And then

""no don't care at all now""
Butterflies sigh and flutter by
""right knew all along""
Sounds like such a lie and you'd be right
Slowly sinking on down
Coffee stain covered my life
My days my nights
Went on and on until you found me
You found me then I suddenly

Don't know I don't know how I can move again
Just like all the hippy kids flooding the street
Don't know I don't know the reason you said
""treasure what you have now""
They're pretty words
But didn't mean a thing
We never saw a thing until it came for you and me and dragging us into the dark with everything now broke apart
Afraid of letting go now
Afraid to move so here you'll always stay
And here you'll always stay

Everybody's so kind
Everybody's so kind thank you all for your time
Couldn't recall though
What they had said low
Looking like they wanna tell me what I know
And everything I see around
They're imitating and debating me
And never making any sound
Deny my heart or deny the mess I've made
I'm starting anyway

I stand here
""don't be too loud""
They tell me every single time
""right knew all along""
Sounds like such a lie and you'd be right
Words so tender but how
That's not what you were really like
That look
That face
Still became so beautiful
Your refection
I still rewind that moment in my mind

Always looking at you far away adoring everything you say but every time I fell for you inside it all the less I knew
So over come the ""real one""
Or be afraid
And here you'll always stay

Don't know I don't know how I can move again
Just like all the hippy kids flooding the street
Don't know I don't know the reason you said
""treasure what you have now""
They're pretty words
But didn't mean a thing
We never saw a thing until it came for you and me and dragging us into the dark with everything now broke apart
Afraid of letting go now
Afraid to move so here you'll always stay
Always looking at you far away adoring everything you say but every time I fell for you inside it all the less I knew
So overcome the ""real one""
Or be afraid and here you'll always stay

No outlet for a plug, c'mon, I'm in the zone daddy
You got to leave, and no don't stop movin 'til the end a the song
Whole club starin at me, how I do it is known
Watchin my niggas gettin wild off a shots of Petron
Uh, know you feelin me, you can't handle the chick
Watchin the bottom, take never puttin your hands on me
It's always one that gotta test you out
Can't even dance without a nigga tryin to stress you out, yeah
 (Jadakiss)
Fella, hit the dance floor don't play shy (uh uh)
Can't leave her alone starin at her all night (uh huh)
That's what you want, says you need her in your life (yeah)
You better pick her up
(Uh, yeah I hear you ma and that's all cool
But I'm a go over here and do me you can go do you
Grown folks don't play games they make moves
So let me hold somethin' huh)

Yeah, I steps in like give me my space (what up)
They wanna know who it is, my hat low can't see my face
And it's just too hard to hate Kiss
For now give me a water then send a guard or waitress
I'm a be in the rear burnin a fat one
Somethin to hold me down, until the yak come
Gotta a 5 sack on the couch they ready
Three piece over there but they kinda heavy
Great chicks waitin on the word
And I got the older ones hatin on the birds
I wanna know, am I am pimp or a zip outta luck
Bishop Don Juan betta get my cup
And they ain't pay me to get on the mic
But if it's goin down then I might just pop shit on the mic
And before I let go please let me get anotha glass of Exo
Ready let's go


Starin as I glide by
Four inches add a extra somethin to it, switch catchin all the side eyes
Saw somethin nice, but I never chase
And don't stop my movements while I cute face 'um
He lookin ok, I'm feelin alright
Crazy we ain't leavin 'til the sunlight
Partyin is worth it baby, only if it's done right
Over for you limited funds dudes that ain't nice
Don't matter where you from shake ya asses
It's on and poppin right now raise ya glasses
Front to the back a the club this shit rude
And you frontin if you up on the wall, c'mon boo
Uh, I'm gettin stalked every step a the way
But my dogs watch heavy while I'm out to play
Fantasizin while my hips move all in your face
Hopin I turn around and pull you close, give you a taste",https://genius.com/Eve-let-go-hit-the-dance-floor-lyrics
Life is So Hard,Scorpion,2001.0,"[Intro: Eve & 
Teena Marie
]
This song is a dedication to those strugglin' and livin' on
For those who can't see the light, it's comin'
Stay strong, feel me..
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, ooh, ooh

Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

Uh, uh
Thank you God, I appreciate every blessin'
Happiness to heartaches, take it as a lesson
I learned a lot in this year
Got a profession that keeps me stressin'
Facin' criticism, answerin' questions
And you still keep me happy and healthy
Blessed with a mind to play the cards that life has dealt me
No doubt I struggle, I cry at times
Sometimes I wish I could live in a bubble
And it gets hard not to stray to trouble
I'm proud of me, got a family that holds me down
Real friends 'cause the other ones claim they don't know me now
But long as God with me, I'ma be good for sure
He's the one who picks me up when my face is to the floor
Life is crazy, people never cease to amaze me
Stay with stories by how they made me or raised me
And it's funny 'cause everybody seems to be so hungry
Either they want my life, or they want my money

Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

How can life be so hard?
How can my life be so hard?
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Every day I pray to God
Every day I pray
Whatever doesn't kill me makes me strong
Whatever, whatever, whatever

Uh, been through a lot
Still gotta watch my back 'cause people plot
Closest to do you dirty just to take away your spot
Some days I feel like I wanna quit
But I pray too long and dreamed and worked too hard for it
Wouldn't trade my life, none even a little bit
'Cause it could be worse for real, I could be turnin' tricks
Might bitch and whine but always just in the back of my mind
I could be livin' on the streets, nothin' to eat without a dime
So I thank God, and I think why 'cause life's hard
Meet a lot of people but always I'm puttin' up my guard
'Cause you never know, some people snakes
Some people give a lot but mostly not, most people take
A lot of smilin' claimin' realness but most people fake
Still gotta smile, 'cause that's what it takes
Sometimes it's lonely
I feel like people see me really don't know me
But my best friend is Him, and I know He'll hold me

Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars

Uh, uh
I got a lotta people on my side protectin' me
Dee, Waah, Chivon, and the family
Gotta thank God for them 'cause they keep me right
I also thank Him every day for the love of my life
I thank Him, for this gift just to be able to write
And rock crowds that scream my name, able to excite
Thank God for my fans, I love the way they love me
Happy that I'm comfortable, eatin', livin' lovely
I love my life, still there's the pressure and pain
So I make sure that I'm grounded and able to maintain
A lotta people think I'm lucky, travelin' and hangin' out
But if they only knew, I wish could be hangin' out
I'm bangin' out hits, in the studio I'm livin' low
Makin' plans to last a lifetime, make sure I'm gettin' dough
Huh, come on, just so the people know
Uh, come on, just so the people know

Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to send me light so I can touch my soul
And always know right from wrong
Living life is so hard
Every day I pray to God
Tell Him to touch my heart so He can ease the pain
Anything to hide the scars",https://genius.com/Eve-life-is-so-hard-lyrics
Got it All,Scorpion,2000.0,"Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo

Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
20 steps ahead of the rest, they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter, I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit, born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless, nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve, eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden, you better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes?
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough Ryde, you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word, must have the stacks to cross lines, come on

Don't want your dough
I don't want your car (Uh-uh)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Nope)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Uh-huh)
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all (Come on)
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Yeah right)
With them other broads
You might rule it all
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all

Yo a chick is a chick, a nut is a nut
And they always keep an attitude 'til you butter 'em up
Since I ain't gotta buy you stuff, who gon' hold you down
If they try to run in here and tie you up?
Now don't start flippin' it, everybody know
We've been had dough, y'all just start gettin' it
Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home and make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo, I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think
If I offered you any ice, love, it'll be in the drink
And instead of talking 'bout what you got and all that
Just make sure when I hit you that you call back
Come on, uh-huh

Don't want your dough (Uh-huh)
I don't want your car (Yes, you do)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Stop lying)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me (Come on)
Sorry boo, I got it all
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car (Uh-huh, yeah right)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Yeah right)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me
Sorry boo, I got it all

Yo, yo ayo
One touch will make a nigga blush on sight
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough, baby, Eve alright
'Cause if Eve wanna fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal, baby, Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all, that's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss, I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them, I pulled on you
Come on now, how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout
Just for fun, I hit the bank and pull 50 out, uh ah

Don't want your dough (Uh-huh)
I don't want your car (Yes, you do)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Stop lying)
With them other broads
You might rule it all (Rule it all with you too)
But not with me (Come on)
Sorry boo, I got it all
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car (Uh-huh, yeah right)
Don't want your jewels
No, not at all (Yeah right)

Styles: Eve let's do it again! Hahaha...

Yea it's the ghost Jada and Eve
I squeeze my shit, I don't wave it and leave
Y'all motherfuckin' extra lame
Here's the game, when I shoot seeds, your man can catch your brain
He looked a hero when he drove the taxi in the hallway
Shootin' niggas down if they clothes is tacky
Get an 18 or brick and my clothes is khaki
And the Porsche got a glass roof
The blunt got a live purple haze in it, little bit of hash too
See me when I pass through, fuck around and I'mma blast you
Do what I have to, tryin' to get my math too
I leave a message, ain't a phone I use
I call my niggas, bat 'em down, they bones I bruise
Leave 50 niggas dead, niggas know my groove
Another 20 more engine niggas know my tools
I got a gun, you need to stand fo'
FUCK YOU BRING YO' MAN FO'?!

Styles: S be the ghost, Double R What
First come the hawk, then next come the toast
Jadakiss: J to the *muah* Double R what
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah
Eve: E-V-E, Double R What
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ryde or Die, Double R What
Better keep your hammer right by your side

I gave you the best flows
On top of that, I even made niggas set goals
I wanna know how many bullets can your flesh hold
Thirty-two, or whatever the tech holes
My dirty crew rather hawk you to death rather than talk you to death
Cause listenin' is like livin' when yo' talkin' is death
So y'all better start readin' before you start bleedin'
And the odds was against us before we got EVE-n
Niggas in the hood don't give a fuck if you rich
Or drunk with the Prince CD own, bumpin' a kiss
Nigga frontin' I get my you in the pump kinda hot out
Hit the button put the roof in the trunk
Play the block with the Royal Blue 45 and make your mouth leak
Can't fuck with NY
Get my diesel from South Beach
You ain't got a ride, getchu a cab
Ya' bitches is mad
Eve got the shit and smash

Styles: S be the ghost, Double R What
First come the hawk, then next come the toast
Jadakiss: K to the R, Double R what
Send mad cowards on they way to Allah
Eve: E-V-E, Double R What
First lady, I just point, they squeeze
Ryde or Die, Double R What
Better keep your hammer right by your side

I'm a savage bitch
Ain't nobody gettin' close to this
And ain't nobody flipped and wrote the shit
And can't nobody sit and coach this shit
You feelin' lucky? then aproach me, shit
I'm like the glass, you just the coaster bitch; Under me!
You wanna make it ugly, can't do nothin' 'bout it
Angry at the public, buggin' me
Rat bitch, pot bitch, hungover hot bitch
Wantin' all that money, fuckin' gettin' all that rock, shiiit
Scared of who? huh, we goin' get rid of you
Climbin' the walls wit' gimmicks, that shit is pitiful
Dawgs close by me, so why try me
They wan' cop me but they too sloppy
Damn, I gotchu stuck in a box
You feelin' trapped, got your stomach in knots
Cause I ain't lettin' go
I keepin' it locked
I know you gettin' mad cause your luck's up
Plus I'm a purebread, baby, I don't fuck with mutts
Come on!

That’s What It Is,Scorpion,2001.0,"They usually hate her when she comes around
Huh, first lady mobbin' nigga hit the ground
Next break into that who we what a sound
Heads boppin', never fails once the Doc's around
Hatin the fact that she do things on both sides
But never disrespect two rings 'round both eyes, right?
Ladylike in many ways
Because in trust I can be crazy like on any day
Some do they dirt but best believe in time they pay
Do believe in lettin' shit chill 'til the promised day
Huh, seems they just fade away
I love it 'cause them clowns, they just paved the way
Left it wide open, got no time to play
Mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay
Considered snobby then just hate me I don't give a fuck
Considered sloppy to me, you just need to give it up...

Eve don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is
Eve is the hottest bitch, that's what it is
But she gon' stay ladylike, that's what it is
But I'ma act crazy like that's what it is
Think I got your house shot, that's what it is
Think I got your car burnt, that's what it is
Think I got your people robbed, that's what it is
'Cause we don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is

I ain't got a moment to waste
I'm tryna get to your head, so I gotta make room in your face
And they can't see your eyes or your nose
Why P? 'Cause four-five slugs is consumin' the space
This is Holiday you need, you fuck with the Scorpion
I don't stop poppin' 'til your body don't breathe
Clap more than the audience after the show
Stab more than the butcher, and I'm kinda righteous
So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push ya
She the First Lady, I'm the ghost with the gun
Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy
Ruff Rydin the clique, come up outta your shit
Get clapped in the wig, sold a lotta records
But we never gave a fuck so it's a wrap for the kids
Gat to the back and the ribs
We the hood, Eve and Holiday, bitch, that's what it is

Eve don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is
Eve is the hottest bitch, that's what it is
But she gon' stay ladylike, that's what it is

Think I got your house shot, that's what it is
Think I got your car burnt, that's what it is
Think I got your people robbed, that's what it is
'Cause we don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is

Broke out and got grown, holdin' her own
That bitch come strong, give up, dead wrong
I don't even fuck around 'less you're headstrong
Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown
Can't figure her out
Is she street, sweet, gutter? I'm from the hood
Alotta y'all niggas gold, huh
This bitch two million sold
And I just figured that I'd make it known
Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone
Watch me rock, got my lip cocked
Spit fire, watch it, better duck, you stuck, you crossfire
Thought you was the realest, you said you caught, liar
Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you

Eve don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is

My story

Went from dancing on tabletops to making labels pop
For the love of the money so I could cock everything
From icy rings to drop, tops and now I'm on top
But to look back on my reality
Happy I stopped letting niggas ruin my world
Impressed by niggas trying to school this baby girl
I was fucking too early
15 knowing money was green, puffing too early
Body big, not grown
Knowledged up and too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older cats up in they face
Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in his face
My mami was my shelter but I broke free
Learning that the streets was harder that I thought they'd be
Wanting to be grown, rebelling
Ain't no telling what I'd be pussy selling (Huh) never would I
Instead I wore a G-string, thought never could I
Thought I had to, to be grown beginning of my life

Heaven only knows
(Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows
Heaven only knows
(Heaven only knows)
Heaven only knows

Yo, close myself down, held myself in
Explode by myself alone, no one helping?
What am I to do but cry alone at night
No one in the house, nude T.V. is my life
Who was I to tell? And what would they think of me?
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Selling drinks to a naive kid, I blame me
But I never really had someone tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy, that's true
Teach me that the future was written
Already waiting to respect my self in life
Not to be someone would hate me
Do positive and positive will happen
Stay positive and positive was rapping
It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit
But I chose to see through the negative and make hits, uh

I thank the Lord every night and pray there's no turning back
I wanna keep my family happy and that's that
Seen tears in my mother's eyes from platinum plaques
See things I've done, I don't regret I just, learn
From mistakes in the past knowing now I had to earn respect and earn trust
Some about school was never givin'
The way you find out what life's about is simply living
To be strong, stay strong, let nobody crush you
Your body is your temple young girls, don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second, let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life I take back
Gotta take from the good and the bad collect that
'Cause it help the bill who you see now respect that

Doubted my skills, bet you mad now, shoulda snatched me up
I'm in L.A. now with Dre now, ain't comin back cuz I'm stuck

Had enough of fake cats tryin to shine off these schemes

You talk the most shit, how you politickin moves an'
I crept to the top, shouldn't-a let me catch you snoozin
Me and my management team, laughin' at you while we cruisin
Cause we ain't got nuttin to do none of the choices you be choosin

It's the eve of destruction, tracks I be fuckin
Cats be fascinated by the styles I be bustin
Got you niggas open, got you niggas lustin
Knockin emcees on they backs causin lyrical concussions

I wonder who, which one a dem a carry news
An' a gwan like set, they wan dis-dis ya crew
But the lie, other emcees dem ready die
When we grab the microphone and praise his like Selassie

Emcees try fi test but dem no ready fi di outcome

Can't turn my back on none a ya'll, probably wind up in stitches
Jealous itches y'all can't scratch, irritate your existence
Tryin to cheat your way in this race, knowin you can't go the distance
Runnin up against the thoroughbred outlastin you all

Cause I got stamina, I go as long as you need
Coulda seen a million bitches rhyme but you'll remember me

Cheap stack, keep that
Fake money, nigga, fake thug, we don't need that
What's that all about?
I can see you from a mile runnin' at the mouth
Lies poppin' out
Claimin' you's a hustlin' type of nigga, cut it out
You's an average type of cat
No money, no clout

When Missy flow, I give y'all fever, yo
If your bitch is ugly, you don't need her
Feed her to a wild pack of cheetas
Yo, I let y'all bitches see I'm off the meter, heater
Me and Eve give ya seizures
Know I put your niggas down on their knees, uh, eat up
Then we treat you like skeezers, yo, let me
Let me take a quick breather (Ah!)
Yo, do y'all smell them trees, huh?
Oh, do you hear them bangin' Swizz Beats, huh?
Oh, do you feel the rappin' Missy, huh?
Well where you wanna roll with me, huh? Me, huh?

Dog Match,Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders’ First Lady,1999.0,"Ugh! (Whoa) Ugh! (Woo!) Ugh! Ugh! (Arf! Arf! Arf!)
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
Now for every real dog, there's that bitch that's behind him
That bitch that when that nigga get to missin'. she gon' find him
Old girl gonna stand with the dog, hand in hand with the dog
And whatever the fuck went down she ran with the dog
First time I had a match and didn't scratch
You catch just loss half you niggas, but the punk can fetch
And I know my baby girl is gonna stretch
Any rappin' motherfucker, male or female, place your bets
You can imagine what the bloodline is like
Since I love mine to fight, I'm on some shit like what time tonight
Y'all niggas can't be for real, 'cause any one of you faggots
Will catch a face full of lead, bitch, you shouldn't be faggots
Fuckin' maggots, once you have it, as good as I got it
I know my hands is in my pockets, but Eve got you spotted
Red dotted, Eve didn't before the Dog
Nothin' but a walk in the park

Always been the bitch that could roll with a thug and wipe up the blood
Roll in the mud with your other ducks, nigga what?
What you need when the chips is down
I'll abide on the stand when evidence is found
I give pound to ya niggas they respect this bitch
I spit rounds at your enemy no less than six
Always keep the extra clip Dog taught me well
The extra eyes on your team I see who's next to fail
Always hold your back up, I pick it up when you slack up
And if attention gets to close I tell the world to back up
Bind too tight, rhymes who ride?
Bitch and you livin' nigga lessons through life
Fuckin' with the dog he's the master
Plus he's gonna show me how to blast ya, bullets hit you then pass you
Split you then stash you, the game is real
E-V-E, DMX, the name's for real, uh

Fuckin' with the dog man niggas keep beefin'
Eve will hold it down now, niggas can believe (Woo!)
Quick as niggas come and quick as they'll be leavin' (Ugh!)
Paramedics on your chest, pushin' and breathin'
Fuckin' with the dog man niggas keep beefin'
Eve will hold it down now, niggas can believe (Woo!)
Quick as niggas come and quick as they'll be leavin' (Ugh!)
Paramedics on your chest, pushin' and breathin'

Get 'em girl, ha-ha, that's my baby
I'ma put the bitch down, 'cause the boy got rabies
All my pups is crazy, 'cause off the leash
They can eat, stand a match for three hours at least
And if the beast is in the big one, the beast is in the little ones
Talkin' 'bout let's hit him soon, fuckin' with the little guns
Y'all niggas had a little run, what more do you want?
For your fans you can front, but the dog is on the hunt

You know I'm at the door point fox rippin' 'em out
And you're the only one that can tame me when I'm flippin' 'em out
Bite's lethal, no recovering I spits no other than acid
Up against the top contenders none of them lasted
This bitch gon' always hold you down, keep the cowards thinking twice
I keeps it gritty, nigga, never think that love is life
Turnin' my back is something cats would do, I never take flight
'Cause any breed he puts me up against, this bitch is gonna bite

Fuckin' with the dog man niggas keep beefin'
Eve will hold it down now, niggas can believe (Woo!)
Quick as niggas come and quick as they'll be leavin' (Ugh!)

You Ain’t Gettin’ None,Scorpion,2001.0,"Ah-ah, na-na
Ah-ah, na-na

First time I seen your face I was like ""damn""
Put your arm around my waist I was like ""man""
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man
True I'm human like you but gotta play it smart
Questions I gotta ask for we get this start
Pulse racing fast damn can you feel my heart
Got me feeling wild yeah you doin your playa part
Tryin to feel you up excuse me I mean feel you out
What your life like tell me what your mind about
Oh you ain't even trynna share no secrets; straight to bis
Wifey? Baby-mother? You got any kids?
One word answers oh I ain't feeling that
Then the pain for american express black
But I'm a play it cool and let you think you running things

Listen baby you know that I'm attracted to you crazy
But I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me
You ain't really tellin' me shit and try'nna slay me
And on the real this quiet shit is startin' to drive me crazy
The only thing that's keepin' me still is sex appeal
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real
Something in my mind sayin' that you probably got the skills
But I ain't giving in your friends they feminine
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimmin' in
But them lips though make me wanna try my luck
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck
Cause you dress right I'm supposed to be pressed right
But on the real you got me thinking if I could be blessed tonight
Let me stop thinking these things it's not polite
I wanna give it to you raw but I'mma put up a fight

From subliminal seduction not really touchin'
But, like, rubbin' actin like you wantin' nothin'
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushin'
Treat me like your prey—only your sexual huntin'
I'm runnin', frontin' 'cause really I'm wantin' to
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushin'
I'm tight vexed cause I'm really dwellin' on the sex
Chills up my spine the way you smellin' up my neck
I'm like putty in your hands I gotta keep my composure
Plus I'm try'nna remember how long I really known ya
You make it hard fightin' you off is like a job
But I'm doin' good so far body startin' to throb
Should I give in ready to open my garage
And let you park in the dark but damn I gotta
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave
You need know that dinner was lovely but I really gotta go

Stuck Up,Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders’ First Lady,1999.0,"Yo Eve, where you at, man?
I'm tired of talkin' to this answering machine shit
I seen you earlier
But you know you was with them Ruff Ryder niggas
I ain't really fuckin' with it like that shit

Yo, yo nigga, if you shy, move on
Only room for a thug that can hold on
Keep me right in the night, early in the morn'
I need a dog that can bite it if the pressure's on
Damn, I hate it when I find out that you niggas soft
Go run and hide for cover when the trouble starts
I like it when he stay and play his part
Ain't scared to put a slug through a nigga's heart
Takes the best of both worlds, don't discriminate
East Coast, West Coast, I don't playa hate
Platinum Daytan on the 6-4, regulator
Big trucks in the hood, black Navigator
If you icy with the price, bring me that ring pa
Might entice me to play nicely, come and get'cha
You got a wifey, tell her nicely I'm in the picture
'Cause I ain't gon' struggle for long and try to get'cha

Come on Eve, why you talkin' crazy and all stuck up?
Why you stay tryna play me like yo' ass is tough, what?
My own fuckin' money ain't good enough
You got a nigga so sick, I'm 'bout to throw the fuck up
But I love ya (Come on, ma)
I need ya (Understand, ma)
I got to have ya
Eve, Eve I'd do anythin' to keep ya

Yo, thinkin' you fly on ya next tell cell, with accumulated jewels
Smellin' like you on doche, nigga, you well
But heard you ain't ready to share
How can I live with you? Icy huh?
Me standin' next to you bare, I heard your pockets knotted
But me, I'm schemin' on the cottage
And you a nigga to turn his back on a bitch
Like I ain't got it and forget that
Bratty type spoiled by the best black
Caddy escalated, '99 edition, get that
And what you ain't equal to a shwang and I ain't with that
Not impressed by all of this is mine but we can split that
Give me all of it, homebody, this ain't no Kit-Kat
Start me off with time, couple weeks and I could flip that
What's this 50/50? You ain't breakin' off none
Ya stash is limited, I see it insufficient funds
Mad 'cause I don't speak but why should you disrespect?
So until ya pockets swells speak to the back of my neck

Come on Eve, why you talkin' crazy and all stuck up?
Why you stay tryna play me like yo' ass is tough, what?
My own fuckin' money ain't good enough
You got a nigga so sick, I'm 'bout to throw the fuck up
But I love ya (Come on, ma)
I need ya (Understand, ma)
I got to have ya
Eve, Eve I'd do anythin' to keep ya

Yo, yo blonde hair must be an aphrodisiac for cats
Want me, dicks be harder than aluminum bats
Flaunt me, I don't hang around with average cats
With average whips, that spend average stacks
I'm into anythin' but normal things
Celly rings from tha broker at the stock exchange, I'm hearin' that
Glacier-filled chains all the haters starin' at me
Make sure I stay nice and keep ya bitches glarin' at
Wave ya Rollies in the air, yeah, last year
Now I'm searchin' for the platinum iced out Cartier
Laid up in da cuts in silk Dolce underwear
Yeah, baby, spend that, that's all I'm tryna hear
It's funny how I used to want the richest niggas
Keep five on deck to see who get the quickest figures
'Cause I only want the pick of the litter for this one
And now because my papers got bigger, you gets none

Come on Eve, why you talkin' crazy and all stuck up?
Why you stay tryna play me like yo' ass is tough, what?
My own fuckin' money ain't good enough
You got a nigga so sick, I'm 'bout to throw the fuck up
But I love ya (Come on, ma)
I need ya (Understand, ma)
I got to have ya
Eve, Eve I'd do anythin' to keep ya

Never Gone,Lip Lock,2013,"Who’da ever thought it would be me
Talkin' to you about life, look at Eve-E
It been a lot of wrong and right, never easy
I’m trying to make it through, like you believe me

Ayo, every day it’s a struggle
Waking up, stressed emotions I juggle
As I look around and watch the world crumble
Something tell me, ""Pray and always stay humble""
Yea, what doesn’t kill you only make you stronger
Stay chin up, hold on a little longer
They used to doubt me, and tell me I ain’t have a voice
But then the angel showed me a better choice
Never let the world tell me how I’m defined
I give myself credit, never need a co-sign
Some days I cry but then I think and realize
I’m a star, and damn it, I’ma shine
Show the world all the greatness that I possess
Gotta keep the pushin', keep on makin progress
If a beautiful rose can grow from concrete
Then there’s no reason for man to accept defeat

Tell the world for me
Who’ll miss me when I’m gone
What’s a fight without defeat
What’s a day when there’s no Eve

Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone
Never gone, never never gone

Remember like a permanent scar
The feeling I had when you said I wouldn’t go far
I knew how to shine, but life kept me in the dark
Dreaming I’m the moon, ‘cause the world’s too hard
Goals with no plan, running through quicksand
Thought I’d go under, but I’m still breathing
Not afraid of war so I keep fighting
I’m worth a lifetime, no one nice in
So I go back to the lab again, grab me a pad and pen
Write a legacy for my children’s children
Build a world for everybody to live in
And who would me I’d gladly do it again
Wouldn’t believe, now I know that I’m chosen
And everyone that kept it G, I owe them
Treasure my heart, so I always stay golden
Live for the dream and I’m lovin' the moment


Hey, there are many moments in life
That make you feel the only option maybe is to fight back
And it feel foreign to you, ‘cause you ain’t like that
Never let nobody steal your powers, snatch it right back
You gotta be the person you was born to be
I learned the only person I could control is me
And maybe they will see inside of me eventually
And even is they don’t you got the right to disagree
Now listen, I ain’t got the answers or the plan
Me, I’m trying to figure out, trying to understand
Trying to be the best woman I could be for man-kind
Love is to be shared so I give mine

I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
And this time I won’t miss
I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
On top of the world I’ll live",https://genius.com/Eve-never-gone-lyrics

Mean no harm. I admire ya style (Hmm)
Just take a second baby here me out
I know ya game you tryna make me shout
Yo look I'm just tryna figure you out
He approached me boldly. Said he felt me said I'm lookin lonely
I had to stop 'em. Tell him daddy chill cause you don't know me
He said listen ma mean no harm
Just wanna let you know my story yo, don't be alarmed
Usually I'm like the bitchy type
I'm quick to hit 'em wit a 'Ha yeah, ok aight'
'What's ya name again?'
But I was feelin dude
And to my surprise for once I wasn't being rude
Had these eyes that'll make you melt
So what its corny. That's the way I felt
Had this body not a big deal but it helped
I mean this nigga had some shit wit 'em
And everytime I tried to talk
He grabbed my hand and said sweetheart just listen
Chorus
Felt like I was little. Got me back to shy days
Is he being real or is he comin at me sideways?
Said he want a build wit me. I'm like here we go
Said he was a regular nigga that liked my flow
Confidence is key wit me so I let him go on
Casanova sayin shit like damn you got a glow on
I'm like he did his homework knowin what I like
Can't find nothin wrong on 'em and he might be my type
Continued wit his story bout his 3 years in jail
How he missed the streets cause being in there was like hell
Bout his little daughter Kira center of his world
His princess and she know she daddy's little girl
I'm lookin at his face-I looked at my watch
He smiled said he wished that time would stop
I apologized to 'em cause I didn't mean to be rude
He said 'I know you busy. Just really wanted to meet you.'
Chorus
Asked me if I had a man I said that I didn't
Wanted to know if he could be that wit my permission
Told 'em that I wasn't ready. He said 'Yeah right'
Told me that I need a real nigga in my life
I agreed wit 'em. Told him that'll come soon
Let him know that I enjoyed the talk but had to run soon
He asked when's the last time I took time for me?
And if I ever reflected on how shit could be
He told me I was blessed. I said 'Dog I know it'
He said just a reminder. Feel that way and never blow it, huh
Slipped me his number said use it for inspiration
Kissd my cheek and whispered thank you for your conversation, huh

My albums are the shit, your career never farted
You thought I left, I wasn't gone, I'm just back again
I was overseas making them millions
From Belgium to Brickston, over to Japan
International paper, getting paid again


It's crunch time, my time, baby, I'ma get it
Heat it up, stir the pot, throw some Eve in it
Cook it up, serving fiends just a little bit
Having them addicted, better believe it
Tell them suckers go hard or go home
No surprise, make a claim to the throne
Time's up, kingdom overthrown
Make way, you catch it back to the dome
I can be sweet, got my lyrics steady man
Bodying these hoes, yellow tape at the scene
It is what it is, I'm a lyrical dream
Show some respect and bow down to the queen
I'm sitting pretty, Haute Couture Culture
But don't doubt me, I'm a pure brand hustler
Everything I had I had and gonna get
Cause wasn't nobody ever giving me shit",https://genius.com/Eve-grind-or-die-lyrics

Quick to make him start bitchin' make the next man whine
Fuckin' babies! Go ahead and lay down, it's nap-time

And little doggies dyed pink

If you know somethin', speak the shit, I can keep a secret
To me, the niggas with the most money, is the cheapest
Wanna give me money off the book? Daddy you can keep it

And walk with big brolic niggas thats protectin' they life

Call me the lioness, I’m killing, killing competition
I’m the one that you’ve been waiting on, so thrilling
You should get a taste of this, so filling
I’m in the kitchen with the gumbo
Got bars, yeah, dumb flow
I just stepped like a force one
I got a life huh, you should’ve bought one


Mega star status, it’s beyond this galaxy
You wanna glimpse Of my reality
Chyeah, I’m fresh up out the kitchen
Now pay attention what the world been missing
Yo, You they say I’m the antidote, better yet the cure
Feel the potency cause the product is pure
Running, running through your veins, guaranteed you get addicted
Constantly craving this audio prescription ‘cause


Ayo, I know you like it, like it, I’m it
You might be in the building, but I’ve built this shit
You just a visitor, I picked it out brick by brick
Call me the architect of your future, now that's sick
You said you ain’t seen me often
Well, most of my currency is foreign
And I stay up, stay up on a plane
Really don’t matter, you could never ever touch my lane ‘cause",https://genius.com/Eve-mama-in-the-kitchen-lyrics
All Night,Lip Lock,2013,"Soon as I walked in I caught his eye
Grabbed me and said he wanna be mine
Told him to hold up and take his time
There's a lot of dudes waitin', so get in line
So listen to me, I’m not a regular bird
Gotta be special to see my world
What you gonna do to give me thrills
To get with E V E you gotta have skills
So if you want it, come and get it
Go, I’ll show you things you never saw
I can get you tickets front row to my peep show
Can be like an animal, really can you handle, though
Need to see that you can have it all

All I need is a beat like this
And I lose my mind
All I need is a girl like you
We can go all night
All I need is a beat like this
And I lose my mind
All I need is a girl like you
We can go all night
All night, all night
All night, all night

You ain’t ready for this boy, you know you scared
It takes a lot to make the sexy kitty purr
No cheap thrills over here, fuck what you heard
Have you geekin' like Screech, nerd
Rude boy, why you sweatin' me
You can’t even handle me
Man you need to stop
Can’t you see I’m outta your league
To impress me you gotta have caliber
Put some precision in your swing, Excalibur
I done gone pro, you still a amateur
You could test it out, but boy you’ll damage her
Back to the drawing board, you gotta get your swag up
You in love baby boy, man up


Shawty say it real fast, that’s how she want it
I told her I’m from Houston, understand we do it slowly
I said her eggs was a'snaking and she wish she never known that
I hate to break the bad news, but baby I pack the cobra
Shots of Henny and soda, man we twist it and roll it
From the door to the sofa, she scream my name like promoters
She tell me that I’m the hottest
I said correction, the coldest
I be in it all night, she wake up makin' mimosas
Gotta her caught in the feelings, textin' and Twitter mentions
She givin' me up her heart, gonna be credit cards in a minute
You are rockin' with the trillest, trillest you ever witnessed

"U, Me And She",Eve-olution,2002,"I'm sittin' down in da corner
Chillin' with all my boys
Mr. Biggs is in the house
U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby, baby?
Get at the party, city of Venis
I did it to myself, couldn't help the way I felt about him
Sick when he wasn't there, like I never dealt without him
Played the fool by choice, all I had was this man
Let him have the best of both worlds 'cause it was his clan
All the things I wanted to hear, he told me gently
Whatever it was, wanted nothin', gave me plenty
Told me that he split with this chick but couldn't shake her
'Cause she had his kids so he fed her with this paper
First it started off like that, dough for closure
Started slackin' off, in fact it wasn't over
Now my world is crumblin' down, I'm feelin' shaky
Used to be a superwoman, no bitch could replace me
Wanted him to leave me alone but I was caught up
Thought I was strong, broke down when breaking up was brought up
Tried to really ride with this dude, I thought I loved him
And every time I asked what I should do, he said trust him
U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby?
(Trust me)
Baby
(Hold me, yeah)
U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby
(Believe me)
Baby
(Need me, yeah)
To hate, I must be crazy, feeding him the bullshit
Attitudes and tryin' to hold out that shit was useless
The more I tried to back up, the more he kept comin'
Lie after lie, shit, lying wasn't nothin'
Tear after tear come down, tellin' me to be cool
All I need is you, baby, nobody could be you
Believed him, he deceived me just to keep me
Callin' me from her spots sayin' how he need me
I had to step back, he got me stressed out
This ain't what I planned, thought I had my life sketched out
Huh, I guess not, love me to hurt me
Hurt me to make-up, then make-up to desert me
U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby?
(Trust me)
Baby
(Hold me, yeah)
U, me and she
What we gonna do
Baby
(Believe me)
Baby
(Need me, yeah)
Back and forth with the he said, he said got me dizzy
If I leave, know the routine, he beg 'cause he miss me
Too late, 'cause you had me, lost me, daddy, move on
Boss-bitch, no more floss, nigga, I'm gone
Arguments for hours, me and her comparing notes and
After all the screamin' stop, we comparing quotes
You got sloppy thoughts, you was that nigga let me catch you
Heart didn't hurt till I covered up your tattoo
My statue on a pedestal, every breath too
Never knew the worst till you felt what the best do
And I'm that, it's over now, hope I stressed you
But Niggas only do it when you lie, when I let you",https://genius.com/Eve-u-me-and-she-lyrics

As a young, I never grabbed that toy
Drag was taught to grab that and ask, ""Where the cash at""

You think we shoot his pocket sides, deuce-deuce the 25s
You ain't takin' 'em, nigga, you threatenin' lives
I ain't frontin', motherfucker, I don't shoot no legs
I'm tryna see if your brains really look like eggs
Or is it just that commercial? Your brain on drugs
Now it's a total different look from these shotgun slugs
To get rich, it could take less than two days
I'm like them little beepers halfs and bullets two-ways
Fuck vests, my shit go through toupéés
I'm a thug in New York and when I'm on your set
We the apartment where they filmed good times at
Bitch, what the fuck? I'm a thug nigga

I'm a thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fuckin' with me, I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now, I'ma do my thing
Like a motherfuckin' dog, let the gun, gun, bang
I'm a thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fuckin' with me, I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now, I'ma do my thing
Like a motherfuckin' dog, let the gun, gun, bang

Weight on my back, hate in my heart
Blood in my eye
Foot on the gas, blunt in my mouth
Lovin' the ride
Hand on the gun, ear to the street
Back to the wall
Mind on my money while I'm clappin' at y'all

I got niggas in jail, crack in the hood
Hustle in south
Fiends and customers that run in your house
I got family ties, I'm handy with knives
I live my life in the ghetto, nose candy and .9s
I'm deeper than most
Sleep with it close, wake with a demon
Have visions of the whole world shaking and screaming
[Verse 5: Styles P & 
Jadakiss
]
I was born to be a leader
But if the game was dirty, I was born to be a cheater
You talking to me greezy
I was gone to get the heater
You tell me what you know about blow
Gettin' dough and straight warrin' with a meaner
Frontin' in a Benz or I was soarin' in a Beemer
Lyin' in the cut
The gun is straight running like a tire on the trucks
If he is real or a liar put the plier to his nuts
Or the fire to his guts
'Cause niggas is too soft
That heat make niggas cool off
Fuck ice, I'm tryna cop the crew lofts
So we can be back in effect
I throw the barrel to the back of your neck
And hop back in the 'vette
'Cause everybody is a felon with loot
They say rap is like dust and we the only ones sellin' the juice

I'm a thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fuckin' with me, I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now, I'ma do my thing
Like a motherfuckin' dog, let the gun, gun, bang
I'm a thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fuckin' with me, I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now, I'ma do my thing
Like a motherfuckin' dog, let the gun, gun, bang

Yo, yo
Bitches is so sick, they throw up
So scared, they don't even come around in places that I show up
Go 'head, nigga, put your dough up
Me against who? Nigga, grow up
Bitches choke, can't even get their flow up
I ain't got no fear 'bout you bitches in the industry
Actin' all confused, don't know who you supposed to be
Chickens lost, steady worryin' 'bout who's dick is tossed
Stop stallin', better get this thing before it's gone
But I ain't mad 'cause I ain't gon' pass it on
Callin' askin' can you get on my shit 'cause your cash is gone
You won't get no sales off of me, bitch please
Pitbull run with dogs, I don't like fleas

I'm a thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fuckin' with me, I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now, I'ma do my thing
Like a motherfuckin' dog, let the gun, gun, bang
I'm a thug in the streets and I know what to do
If you fuckin' with me, I'ma fuck with you
I don't give a fuck now, I'ma do my thing

Let This Go,Eve-olution,2002,"You and me should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm thinkin' that you and me, should just let this go
We never did take the time, to try to hold on
I'm sick of that
Yea it's hard. Breakin' up ain't never easy. Believe me
But fuck that. I wasn't gettin' treated like I needs be
But trust. I was controllin' all the things around me
But shit. I always been this chick ever since you found me
I tried and I tried. Cried and I cried
Down for you nigga wit' lie after lie, after lie
Got sick of tradin' games wit' you
Started bein' jealous of me like dames would do
I'm like dawg check ya balls. Mad 'cause I receive applause
Men in my life was against the law
Startin' fights in public just so you could piss me off
I swear. If I was a dude it'd be fist to jaw
Always mad at my mouth 'cause I cursed you out
Missin' hard. Know you feelin' what these verses 'bout
Doin dumb shit. Breakin' things. Hidin' my phone
I'm outta 'dis here. Pimp jus' leave me alone

Ya love girls, girls. Yea but you lost the best
I had to get away. I'm past the stress
Mama told me baby girl never settle for less
Learn the hard way. Hard days. I'm ready for next
A bunch of leavin'. I don't need Eve's shit. I'm doin' me
Soon as pack you sippin'. With the booze. You and me
Reminiscin' 'bout the way you was pursuin' me
Actin' like your period on screamin' you doin' me
Well bye dawg. Have a nice life I'm fine dawg
Don't try to track me down or call 'cause that line off
Hope you feelin' bad without me. See if you can laugh without me
Cry what tears? I'm happy I'm free
Still ridin' past the spots that you know I go
Procrastinatin' wit' yo niggas hopin' that I show
Never know what you have 'till it's gone (huh)
Wonder what she doin'? Best believe she doin' her (come on)

Funny how it happens when you fall in love
When you find out that the one you wit ain't who you want
Then you move out 'till you find yourself anotha love
But your ex gone always hate 'cause he can't hit you off
You don't hear me though
Claim you wanna please me. Yet you vex me
Can't front. Be thinkin' 'bout the way you used to sex me
God damn. Days short. Nights was long
And I was mad when I started spendin' nights alone
But I'm better off by myself lookin' for somethin' else
Sendin' me shit you can't pronounce. I don't want nuthin' else
Wanted to love you until the end of my time
But fuck it. I'm done wit' you at the end of this line (uh-huh)",https://genius.com/Eve-let-this-go-lyrics
The Beat Is So Crazy,Here I Am [Shelved],2007,"Some nights, all alone
Thoughts of you come creepin' in
Temporarily insane
Cause you're never gonna change, no

We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought
We'd be happily forever

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

Never thought I was the type to hang around
Lied to myself constantly
Bout the person I thought you would be
Who's to blame, I guess it's me
I cause my own misery
Tit for tat, this and that
I needed my own life back
Now here I am
I'm so happy it's time to move on

The beat is so crazy
It makes me wanna let go
And totally forget today
I'm better off anyway
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh
O-oh, oh, oh, o-oh

We had good times with the bad
Always out with what we had
Keep your pride, I'm not mad
Make me feel like loves a fad
I'd always thought, we'd be happily forever

I'd always thought (what you want her to do?) now here I am

Zero Below,Lip Lock,2013,"I got no answer, I got no love
So my heart pumps icicles
No answer, I got no love
So my heart beats zero below

Ayo, tell me why should I ever give a fuck
My time is money, man, and you ain’t even worth a buck
Don’t excuse the tone, this is how it is
Formula cold-blooded, and I don’t give a shit
Got an announcement, the golden child coming
Straight killing em, boss bitch stunting
These hoes crippled, not even in the running
Put out the fader, so you know I ain’t fronting
They had a little time, tried to be E-V-E
Snatchin' the plate back, it’s my turn to eat
And I’m a greedy bitch, man I don’t like to share
Whole world mine, yea, yea, it ain’t fair
They said I turned cold, once I made my millions
I know you’re mad, my success really hurt your feelings
No sugar coating anything around here
Lioness, run team, who should I fear?


‘Cause I’m a cold motherfucker, I’m a cold motherfucker
She a cold motherfucker, I’m a cold motherfucker
‘Cause I’m a cold motherfucker, I’m a cold motherfucker
I’m a cold motherfucker, I’m a cold motherfucker


Isabelle Marant, bottles blood stained
From all these wannabes that thought they was better than me
Got 'em thirsty for it, give this bitch a drink
Iceberg dead ahead, I made Titanic sink
I’m just what they not, damn, that's really all you got
You could never take my spot, trust me, you don’t wanna pop
Yea, I shoot, when shocking, all reason that yo mouth drop
Fuck you ‘cause you’re at the bottom, love me ‘cause I’m on top
I’m a fashionista, cannibal, I eat ya
History I teach ya, anywhere I meat ya
Still tryna get a gig, baby, I’m the feature
If you wanna wear my crown, dig a little deeper
Hah, you ain’t even in my league
Murder murder, I’ma kill 'em on this beat
Got ,em shook now, getting dirty looks now
Still you shine, guess I’m a crook now


‘Cause I’m a cold motherfucker, I’m a cold motherfucker
She a cold motherfucker, I’m a cold motherfucker

Chorus: Eve
People hear me when I talk yea(As I grow)
People try to break me but I (Still stand strong)
Cuz this life that I live it's (All I know)
And can nobody can take me off this (Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea

Yo
I'm in a position to help a lot of people
When I love it, but people that claim that they love me
Want to take advantage of it
I duck 'em, I can't lie
That toss alot of lies
Can't trust the story tears swellin in my eyes
Let my pen stab the page, Times I feel raged
Sometimes I feel trapped got me locked in a cage
But I break free
Won't never let the anger overtake me
Cuz actions of another never make E or break E
I never let 'em shake me
And no matter what I never always wish exesive ho's that hate me
The ones they call my enimies
Who only want to be friends of me
On the other hand surrounded by the greatest team
Who wouldn't trade mind for nothin not for anything
Thank you for giving me your best
And I appreciate giving you everything and nothing less
Chorus: Eve
People hear me when I talk yea(As I grow)
People try to break me but I (Still stand strong)
Cuz this life that I live it's (All I know)
And can nobody can take me off this (Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea

I live my life threw my semi chest
My heart beat strong, sometimes contaminated by the pest
And yeah I know I'm livin' blessed
And if I didn't make it here, my life would be a mess
Can't live a life of fear
All that get you is nowhere surrounded by a bunch of stress
And I always had a hard head
Had a choice to play around wit life or listen to a gossip
So I straightened up and I'm doin right
Growin every year, aiiyo this thing ain't happen overnight
But I still got alot to do
And never givin up cuz anything I feel I know is possible
Don't never let people disgurage
Plants see the dream, Baby and let 'em flurish
Lettin you in on what I know
Huh, as I live my life and as I grow

People try to break me but I (Still stand strong)

Nothing can keep me from you
Keep me from you, keep me from you

You know that thief in the night
Stole my heart so you better treat it right
I ain't even wanna listen what my friends say
Cause I know that it's all just jealousy
Is it punched or ?
Or could it just be infatuation?
Uh, whatever that is
Time will tell, I don't care, let's live
For the nightless world
Alien love, wanna be your girl
Milk chaser, stumbling
When I get next to you I'm mumbling
If a chick try to step up we rumbling
Want a future with you like remember boy


You're so much more than a crush
I'm down like the Chevy on dubs
On lock, like a pair of handcuffs

Stacked up the game now she reading plenty scripts

But don't get it fucked up I owe it all to the hood life
Congratulate her when you see her past
It's a shame how these shits get agitated when we cross past
But we ain't even on the same level

Smelt right, had to have it
Third joint still going strong I'm not bragging
I guess I am a little bit though making it happen

Try your luck homie, might let you catch me
Never, stay tuned, this chick gets much better
Notice how she stay up in your face cause you let her
Let go of your body, I'm in your head
Hunger for me? No worry, I'll make sure you fed
I'll be all that you need this time

Stutter when you come close like you can't talk
Wide open, papi can't resist what I do

Ryde Away,Eve-olution,2002.0,"Gonna get in the car
Drive away
Drive so far
No one's gonna find me
Put my foot on the gas
Accelerate

Some days I be wanting to get away from it all
To be real this game ain't all it seem to y'all
I mean I'm blessed by my good God
Haaa, that's no question
And I know my journey long
Just a life learned lesson
But the world just a mess right now, going crazy
Thankful for my single mother
Strong how she raised me
Could have gave up long time
And been lazy
But my dream strong
Hear this song I'm not complaining
Just the realization living in this world is draining
I mean I cry real tears and I got real fears
Wanna marriage and some babies
Do y'all hear me in your ears?
Discouraging, keep your courage and walk your path
Question everyday how much longer will we last?
How can you apologize for mankind?
No heart, so soul got sight, but you're the man blind
Not really seeing what he doing to the future
He lost


Love, hate, pain all the same
Still took for granted
Need a reason that's to blame
Gone cause he loved her
Gone cause she hated him
Flipped out taken out from the pain
Who she datin him?
Its like we don't have no meaning
What we breathing for?
Birth child raised right gone now fighting for the war
Damn, enough to make you crawl up in a shell
Cry for the innocent babies in this Hell
Stuck from a fast fuck no shelter from the cold
Drugs and disease never growing to be old
Do you feel me?
Am I seeing all this by myself?
Can't trust the air I breathe
Im praying for my health
Wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow


Sometimes my heart hurt
Wish I could take away the pain with music
But it won't work
I guess I'm just an optimist
What's it gonna take for all of us to stand up
Put a stop to this?
Man, we in this thing together
Live and breathe together
Everybody love life
But never make it better
Everybody talk shit
But never get together
Shit, I ain't trying to preach
I ain't even teaching
There's some shit bottled up inside me
Im just speaking
Wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow
I said I wanna get away but
Where I'm supposed to go?
Can't escape it so I'm making songs let it flow",https://genius.com/Eve-ryde-away-lyrics

Yo, yo, many they pop shit, but me I drop shit, and they cop it
Stay to myself most the time, but still they plot shit
Bitches that's unstable, I can't be involved
'Less they wanna take it back to the street, and problem solve
Touchin y'all, but me I try to chill on the chicken shit
Sit back, do Eve, mastermind my business shit
You dat, screw all these cats, that's tryin to end this shit
Hate me for the rest of your life, I'm just beginnin it

Na, na, na, naaa...

Do you, cuz I'mma do me

Yo, am I made up? Just my make up, nothing fake though
Bitches generate bullshit, I generate dough
On the roll now, got control and I'mma keep it
Made my move, while y'all got comfortable, while y'all was sleepin
I remember bein broke and I ain't tryin to fall back
Nobody listened to my shit, and I ain't get no call backs
Ain't no way that I could have it then lose it
Take my word, I'mma keep slangin shit, makin hits, niggas ya heard?
CHORUS 2X

Yo, ayo, ayo, can you deal with the wild one
When she comes around trottin down Stallion
Got they mouths open now
Bitches frown and I care less, just to get attention
They would wear less, stayin mad at me, but I'm they fearless
Ryde or Die Chick, you know how I get down
Fifty dogs or more when I come through how I get 'round
Got enough stress on my brain, size of stress from you dames
And I ain't even stressin no names
Cuz I'm different, nothin like you bratty chicks bitchin
Nothing like you whining ass niggas that's scared of itchin
What is it you really want
Beggin for your chance then you front
Prayin for a way that you could stunt, on this one here
E V E is ready for your fakin all year
Smile in my front, no use they heated at my rear
Told you from the first attack you shoulda been prepared

Ain't nothin' better put therest on the shelf
I said forget the rest
'Cause she the one they talkin' about
I wanna hear you say these words out ya mouth

Some claim they can't stand her
But they demand her, they watch her
These niggas wanna lock her down and brand her
Some claim they can't take me
Baby don't make me do the thing I do to keep you here, you can't escape me
Gotcha, hear this music don't let nothin' stop ya
Dance and wave yo hands, let this beat start to rock ya
Every step, try to catch yo breath
In and outta control 'till you ain't got nothin' left
I love it when they wildin' out
I got 'em jumpin' around, see don't be shy
Don't hold it in baby just ride it out
Don't worry 'bout the time
Can't handle it? Then find the exit sign

She back, sick wit the blonde and I ain't stoppin'
So I'm droppin' already and holdin' steady
Niggas thought I wouldn't do it said screw it
They wanna try to say face it forget them cowards, they blew it
My attitdue is confidence, Philly sponsored this
And I ain't happy wit just ""that's hot"", I'm makin' monster hits
And I ain't satisfied wit what I got, I need a lotta shit
It's still a hustle for me baby, hungry nigga, common sense

Knowing that he gotta go, but he wanna stay and grind

I’m sorry for being so fly
I didn't mean to row by and catch the eye of your guy
You know I keep em up rock like coke and baking soda
That’s why I’m taking over
He's mine but she can’t get I’m off the sofa
Plus I’m the closest thing to Oprah
Billionaire chick, plus I got that fire chocha
That’s no lie, I put my number in his Motorola
And since then it’s been over, so apologies in order
I’m just hoping you


I’m wondering if I should tell him yes
I know his girl hating on me, but she better rest
I know she wishing that I chill, I’ma let her sweat
Cause now she study in my office like Belichick
I’m a victim of high life, somebody gonna fizz
It costs a lot of bread just to get me out of bed
And I know that he be trying, but he can’t get me out his head
Killing em is a crime, but remember when I said to


You know you're sexy in the morning
You know what’s right feels nice when it started

Huh, won't lie, I cried, but I knew the pain'll pass
No more living in a lie, 'cause the lies never last
No more thinking you that guy, you just a guy from the past
No more baby talk or wet n' walk, you gonna miss me bad

I knew you're gone, left me no go

Ain't no room in this Mercedes for funny business
Funny, funny, funny business
You look good in them jeans, but you can kiss this
This ain't no real reflection of my affection for you
So, please, sir roll up them sleeves just a little
I want them diamond cufflinks, but guess who's single?

My girls to the left
My girls to the right
My girls, sing it loud if you're single
My boys said your head went jingle
It's time to wake up from that dream
The voices in your head, the voices at night
Screamin' that you wanna be single

Vou colidir, tirar teu ar ar ah (uh)
Dane-se quem vai encarar (encarar!)
Nós somos como fogo e ar ar ah (wow)
Então, meu bem, deixe queimar
Hey
Take your turn, let it burn
Vai ser pegar ou largar (woah, woah)
Chega com jeito, cause efeito na medida certa (hey)
Pra me impressionar
A gente sabe o que faz, relaxa
Encaixa o corpo no meu
É nessa batida que eu fico envolvida
Dá tão certo você e eu (vai)
Se solta do medo, me pega com jeito
Quem liga se alguém comentar?
Eu faço teu estilo, fica tranquilo
Só deixa seu corpo falar
Isso é proibido, desperta o libido
Acende e deixa queimar
E não precisa se esconder, comigo pode se mostrar
Pois quando é só eu e você, não temos nada pra negar-a-a-a-ar (tô pronta pra jogar)
Vem aqui gruda em mim, e vai descendo
Cola em mim eu sei, tá acontecendo woah
Não dá mais pra negar, te faço delirar
Cê vai se apaixona-a-ar
E quando o momento chegar ar ah (uh)
Vou colidir, tirar teu ar ar ah (uh)
Dane-se quem vai encarar (encarar!)
Nós somos como fogo e ar ar ah (wow)
Então, meu bem, deixe queimar
Na noite é que eu me criei, eu sou da madrugada
Se não corre comigo é página virada (ah)
Vem de igual pra igual, é mais que natural
Que seu fogo queime tudo perto do meu vendaval (então, meu bem, deixe queimar)
Não se engana, meu anjo
Eu conheço a tua essência
Na malícia da vida, tenho experiência
Hoje digo que fico, amanhã não sei mais
O meu lema é esse, azar se não te satisfaz
Pra ficar comigo, ou soma ou subtrai
Um mais um é dois, menos um tanto faz
E-V-E
A liberdade combina tão bem com a gente
E essa noite não vai ser diferente
Não vou me segurar, não dá mais pra negar
Acho que vai rola-a-ar oh woah
E quando o momento (yeah, yeah) chegar ar (yeah, yeah) ah (uh)
Vou colidir, tirar teu ar (woah) ar ah (uh)
Dane-se quem vai encarar (encarar!)
Nós somos como fogo e ar ar ah (wow)
Então, meu bem, deixe queimar",https://genius.com/Eve-fogo-e-ar-lyrics
Riser,Magik Five (Heaven Beyond),UnKnown,"How heavy the sky was outside of my windows
And from the inside I watched it go by
With all that I've got to reach back to remember
The things I fought, so hard with each thought
Then your voice returns until every word burns the walls
I tried to keep you outside, you're part of me now
But you're not around
Why you're under my skin
You found a way to get in
Why you're under my skin
And now the thoughts I resist
I reuse
Strange how it hits me when all of the moments I used to know travel so close
Through my invitation, I'm reluctant to feel it pierce through my skin
And with every inch it brings back the hurt
As thoughts recur inside my head of all that we said
To leave it behind but now you're inside
Why you're under my skin
You found a way to get in
Why you're under my skin
And now the thoughts I resist
I reuse
You're a part of me now but you're not around

Get on my bullshit
Wake up in the morning
And I get on my shit
Get on my fly shit
Get on my live shit

Não Para,Idol School - 2ª Temporada,2019.0,"Quanto tempo faz
Quanto tempo faz que a gente não se encontra mais
Que a gente não se encontra mais
O tempo parou
Desacreditei quando te vi passar
Ela é como fogo e ar
Feita pra voar, não tem como segurar yeah yeah
Voando alto demais
Seguindo a vida a 150 batidas por minuto
Chama seus amigos e suas amigas, pode chamar todo mundo
Vivendo o hoje como se não houvesse o amanhã
Sem desculpa pra dar
Joga o copo pro ar, joga o copo pro ar
Então voa comigo que a vida é só uma e o tempo é só
Vibrando a mesma frequência desenrolando esse nó
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para
Não para
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para
Não para
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para
Deixa que eu vou te falar
Só não deixa essa clima ou nossa vibe zerar
Sintoniza a batida, a melhor melodia, o compasso que vira pra gente dançar
Tô vivendo no presente, fazendo a minha parte
Se quiser colar comigo, pode entrar, fica a vontade
E usa a roupa que quiser, esquece o tempo lá fora
A gente perto dá tão certo, então só vem e vambora!
Quanto tempo faz
Quanto tempo faz que a música não toca mais
A música não toca mais
O tempo passou
E hoje eu quero te reencontrar
Ele é como fogo e ar
E a noite tá perfeita pra gente incendiar yeah yeah
Então voa comigo que a vida é só uma e o tempo é só
Vibrando a mesma frequência, desenrolando esse nó
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para
Não para
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para
Não para
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para
Mesmo se a noite acabar
Eu comecei e não posso parar
Não quero parar, mesmo se o dia virar
Vou recomeçar do zero
Não para
Não para
Se joga, se solta, destrava e não para",https://genius.com/Eve-nao-para-lyrics
Boy Lixo,Idol School - 2ª Temporada,2019.0,"Já disse pra não me ligar porque não vou atender
Desliguei meu celular pra não ter que ouvir você de novo
Cê volta com essa história que vai se consertar
Mas eu conheço o teu teatro, tu não vai me enganar
Não adianta insistir, se a carapuça servir
Leva ela junto e vai embora pra bem longe daqui
Há muito tempo que eu queria te falar
Aceita e vai embora pro lixão onde é seu lugar
Embuste, boy lixo
Sempre leva não e vai chorar pros seus amigos
Embuste, boy lixo
Tem que tomar jeito se quiser ficar comigo
Embuste, boy lixo
Sempre leva não e vai chorar pros seus amigos
Embuste, boy lixo
Tem que ser direito se quiser ficar comigo
Acha que cê tem razão e você fala demais
Mas o que fala não retrata nem um terço do que você faz
Volta aqui pra Terra, cê tá no mundo da Lua
Se acredita que agindo assim alguma mina vai ser tua
Vê se te manca, acorda, vacilão
Eu não sei nem porquê que eu tô te colocando nesse refrão
Te dar ibope é a pior coisa que a gente faz
Corrige essa postura porque aqui embuste não dá mais
Embuste, boy lixo
Sempre leva não e vai chorar pros seus amigos
Embuste, boy lixo
Tem que tomar jeito se quiser ficar comigo
Embuste, boy lixo
Sempre leva não e vai chorar pros seus amigos
Embuste, boy lixo
Tem que ser direito se quiser ficar comigo (Gegê!)
Rala, se manca, se toca, vê se não encosta que eu vou te falar
Aceita que o bonde é seleto, vê se fica esperto e senta pra escutar
Vou repetir devagar pra você não dizer que me entendeu errado
Se eu te disse não é não, não te quero à vista e nem parcelado
Eu vou pra festa, não quero conversa, eu quero dançar
Não quero atraso do meu lado pra me contrariar
Eu vou pra festa, não quero conversa, pra mim já deu
Eu quero é que você se HÃ... que eu sou mais eu
Eu vou pra festa, não quero conversa, eu quero dançar
Não quero atraso do meu lado pra me contrariar
Eu vou pra festa, não quero conversa, pra mim já deu
Eu quero é que você se, boy lixo, que eu sou mais eu
Embuste, boy lixo
Embuste, boy lixo
Embuste, boy lixo
Eu quero é que você se HÃ...
