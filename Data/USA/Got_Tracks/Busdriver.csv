Imaginary Places,Temporary Forever,2002.0,"I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
And to show you around imaginary places
Put money lumps in my bloody stump
And I will have a smile that's a perfect circle
Die in your sleep with the sky at your feet
I'll shoot you when you're happy, on the day that you will find peace
How do you do? I don't know I'm okay
Every person I know is a secret service agent
'Cause I'm accused of lewd conduct
Stole the heart of a prude prom slut
And they got the warrant for my arrest to put me in
The loony bin, the funny farm, because of what I did
But I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
There is not a single person who can do it better
No needle skippin in my ecosystem
But in the audience may be an evil Christian
HMO how I hate him so
But they charge me for a halo
But I'm on a scavenger hunt for a lavender chunk
Of the sky, maybe I'll replace it with a mud-pie
I play dead songs on the silk screen
Buy my shirt it is a killed dream
It is known to lead the way to the stairwell
To God's administrative office and a final farewell
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
And to give your assault rifle a banana clip
Glow in the dark when I stroll in the park
Givin everybody informative pamphlets!
No sign of life for as far as I can see
Everybody's just charred meat up in the car seat
Eat shit and die to the secret spy
'Cause I have a funny feeling that I'm being watched
24-hour surveillance
Money or power are ailments
But I send the medical supplies and the shipping
And the handling is way too much, 'cause I'm from the Afterlife
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
It's like I put a cough drop right upon your soft spot
Make Martian clothes out of your garden hose
Turn into a deadly gas blowin' through the air duct
She's not in love but I thought that she was
She doesn't love me 'cause I don't have the right haircut
I misunderstood, I should fix under the hood
But I will not apologize for anything that I've said
My name is Mr. Busdriver, this is the producer Paris
We are not embarrassed to admit that we will perish in
A pit of our own imaginary PLACE!
Kids, if you want to piss off your parents
Show interest in the arts
Kids, if you really want to piss off your parents
Buy real estate
In an imaginary place
Oh yes
Okay, okay, alright
Yeah
Now, move

I gotta do my shout outs now
Peace to:
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Paris and Daddy Kev, they'll also be there too
Just here to hold your hand when you die
Of Mexican Descent and Mums The Word will help you
Just here to hold your hand when you die
Freestyle Fellowship and Abstract Rude will help you
I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Chillin' Villain Empire and Hip Hop Kclan too
I'm just here to hold your hand to die
I'm just here to hold your hand when you
Just here to hold your hand when you die",https://genius.com/Busdriver-imaginary-places-lyrics
Worlds To Run,Thumbs ,2015.0,"This slack-jaw mealy-mouth
I mumble when I'm 'round the house
I'm trying not to do no chores today
Crying in my underwear
I lost my sense of wonder there
No, I'm not Milan Kundera
Though this lightness is unbearable
The feeling is indelible
I'm wishing I could teleport somewhere
Transmolecularize
 
through the secular eye
I remember when Vegeta stomped Bardock's neck in
Two prayer hands to the heavens, good Lord, bless Him
I was a broke slob watching 
Ghost Dog
 writing Post Hoc
If I could muster just one good throat chop
And honor my shidoshi, 'cause 'dim mak' means 'death touch'
I been Spock, I been clutch
In thin socks, I'm butthurt
Impervious pervert with niggerish fervour
Crashing Linux server
Who didn't even change his laundry over
Who needs to buy toilet paper
Indie rapper, sorta faker
'Cuz I couldn't afford a mortgage or a Studebaker
'Cuz I couldn't afford a mortgage or a Studebaker

When you're deep in the raw
Everybody wants to get a piece of your heart
There's only so much truth you can keep in your bowl
Speak your piece, but words are too harsh

Overspoke my piece
I'm known in the streets
When you're deep in the raw
There's only so much truth you can keep in your jaw
(So what you saying?)
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world

Every song responds to a threat
Every laundered dollar is wet
But if a mom’s like a song torn breath
But as long as I can ponder the depth
And the king sorta stinks of lunacy
I roam the rinks in sync with the jinx that are having me sink the moon and the sea
Bankers clink drinks as they uplink to the sphinx's coonery
I'm on the brink, I could fill my sink with the king's jewelry
Yeah, who is he? Driver—lion from a dead world
Sole practitioner of his customs and know the RPM of your head twirl
Driver old as fuck
My daughter old enough to vote
Rap songs blowing up on the coast
Loyal subjects rolling up that smoke
As I dictate terms from an ensnarled perch
Yeah, and Leimert Park is Winterfell
Rumors I learn to Splinter Cell and pitches sale from Mike's Citadel
Exact an explicit Hell
Empty the fire and sway
My music on Pirate's Bay as my elusive alliances fray
I collude with a silent clay and infuse a vibrant day
With a soothing eye in decay—putting food on the dining tray
Yeah, I can do this my way
Welcome home

When you're deep in the raw
Everybody wants to get a piece of your heart
There's only so much truth you can keep in your bowl
Speak your piece, but words are too harsh

When I was a younger man
I could feel the entire world
But now that I'm older...

When you're deep in the raw
There's only so much truth you can keep in your jaw
(So what you saying?)
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world from my mama's house
I can run the world

Ego Death,Perfect Hair,2014.0,"Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying, but... is it sexier than torture?
(shah, yeah, Los Angles)
(Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night)
(Yeah, oh shoot, lemme see if I can finish this)
(Okay, lets go, yeah)
(We can make this better (x3))

Under the cellulite laden thigh of the night
I slip miniature mantras between my cries and gripes
Jewel-flavored crystals in the red, blue, and white stripes
While crowds throw numbers at me like The Price is Right
And downtime is never met with an overjoyed grin
Cause sleep and death have always been conjoined twins
You'd rather lick the red gills of pop art
Than your cement-filled pock marks
The withering tendrils from my wrought heart
Reach for a Benadryl like it was a lost ark
Cause my average day is for the body of aegis, they're prompting these sieges
We cry to these seniors, living inside of splotchy Adidas
Serving consecutive sentences
My corrective lenses is ruby quartz
Yet my vision ain't worth a jiggling of booty warts
Circumstances trap writers like Kathy Bates
Under a decolorized happy face
So my car ain't covered in candy paint
But still the nanny state can't fix the diaper rash
I'm pinging this on a cyber cast
Questioning news items playing pattycake with Ira Glass
The fact that this pony show's racist
Stirs the colloquial cake mix and charges the homeostasis
Of all the homies who await us like we some Smokin' Joe Fraziers
But my unchecked whining's like some ceremonial plate shift

We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better

Before long, boil the bones
A little celery chop
A little pepper, a little milk of the poppy
Little posse in effect
Analog mono-poly Man'o'War
Walloping the auto-poly avatar
Mind on his Mallomars
Money on the iron lung
Clumsy with the can of worms
Usher you behind the sun
He shoots he whores, truly stupid troubadours and elders
Stock the shelter with frijoles and blueberry New York Seltzers
Roll up in a pa-diddle like a doofus
Hit the corner like the devil is a cubist
I'm ruthless, the sigil is dog with a cone, feeling foolish
Seven hells calling all foreseeable futures
Be it obtained culprit
Crippling migraine and strange stomach
Or a stray bullet through his gray mullet
I am ivy up the god damn lattice
March to the math rock
Raw, no cartoon mascot
The Mario pajama bottoms clumsily rappelling
Under a gibbous moon
Hunting for shitty food
Gunning, too tough, embedded in bad magic
Duckboy, shit is quacktastic

I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yet

We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better

Rap Marilyn Manson, about as hot as a Vanson
With two hoodies on the beach with two bitches crump dancin'
Rappers put your bets in, last man standin'
Bars hit so hard you ricochet off the planet
The motherfucking hybrid, tell Miley Cyrus text me
When I holler to her private I'm tryna get them privates
Parts, don't start, take heart like Kano
Remember when I told to you niggas drink all the Dran-o
Pop all the pills, take all the lines
Chop through a window with some sawblade blinds
Back on that shit, guess what this time?
Half a stick of dynamite where the sun don't shine
Any nigga disrespecting, chin check 'em 'til he's slinky-neck
Blowing dope, eyes low and chinky like I'm Mannie Fresh
Countdown to extinction, no nigga not Megadeath
So many dead rappers, can't even take baby steps
Walking over carcasses of artists in my garden
Been nice with this shit since Nas was writin' past the margin
Any nigga wanna start it, I fuckin' beg your pardon
I'm with arson, I'm the firestarter; Prodigy invent the art
Smack my bitch up in the mouth with my dick
And it's not domestic violence cause she likes that shit
There's no sentence to describe it, homie
Except she sucked it like her fucking life depended on it

We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better, but we're not, yes we will
We're just looking for something inside us to kill
We can make this better

Me - Time (With The Pulmonary Palimpsest),Jhelli Beam,2009.0,"Me me me me me me me me me me me me me

They paint their vulva beige
Bleed a cola keg
While I plan to ruin GOP motorcades
For these senseless zines turned censored scenes
I earn a soldier's wage
So I broke your legs
Threw you rollerblades
Because you claimed that the OG was overpaid
For pointing M-16s
At grenadine
Coursing through the pollster aids
I need my water brush
In the economic crunch
The financiers are seeped in embalming slush
And the sexist machines
Express the means
To re-appeal Roe vs Wade
So I gotta demode the dark matter
On the spring-loaded park plaza
Who is in charge?
I don't know
They all eat their business cards
I'm a hack at deer shooting
Know Vladimir Putin
While I wear this cashmere pantsuit thing
I can knight the spokesman
So Ibuprofen
Becomes your golden egg

Automated voter readytellers are the subsequent heavy seller
In the pool of undecided registry
Because they don't give a fuck about the findings on a troop surge
It's a moot point
What have you heard?
Bumbling idiots for news correspondents see the desperate need to form a new foreign policy
Yet they give their credence to the pro-war pandering
As we all squabble over Saturn's rings
Regimented doubletalk undercuts the pertinence
Of our corporate heads trying to run away with tax cuts
In their vestables, the evangelicals are tent-poles
Begging the Head of State
""Deregulate the gross!""
Happy ever after
Benefactors all settle matters
The senate gathers to celebrate the fat fuck's
Inability to give a single solitary hoot
About the proletariat
Their merriment is gross
What does this mean for you though?

You nigga's looking gee'd up
Rolling in a Prius
But I gotta give my money management a C+
With my foreclosed home
And pork bowl loans
I revisit the need to grind
I'm dating Russian fem-bots
Sipping on some hemlock
Cause I got overdue billing on my desktop
When I've been overthought and undercooked
That's when I need me time

Me Time (repeat)
Well, I need some me time with the pulmonary palimpsest
Watch the banks merge, liberal thinker
Because now the middle finger is the California state bird

Werner Herzog,Arguments with Dreams,2008.0,"How could you call yourself the best rapper
You in a cover band that’s playing Sledgehammer
In your cupped hands is pet hamster
Your genitals are sitting on wet pampers
Holdup while I test this red snapper
Militant like a pledged Panther
I hunt big name nigga, I collect antlers
And you got bitch problems, breast cancer
Hellfyre Club we the wrong set to slander
We’ll make you eat a crepe filled with Chia pet dander
And I always stay on the set with cameras
I go Herzog, nigga you dead like Dirt Dog
All you movie-making lames in the booty-shaking vein
On the moving gravy train are left in excruciating pain
Because I’m in the house, you be like “which house?”
I make Witch-House up at your bitch’s house
Wearing nothing but a Speedo and a pig snout
Y’all must have pricks and ovums
Jocking me like I’m Chris Nolan
My scathing critique of your shit leaves your script molten
Because you want to drive porches through the Waterloos
Have a home like the 
Fortress of Solitude
So on-set to snort shit through a hollow tube
But at the end you’re just gorgeous piranha food

He's Herzog, I'm P.T. Anderson
At your premiere I snuck 3-D cameras in
I bootlegged your shit for the downtrodden
Cause you got your film degree at a clown college
You use brown polish, like a white racist
And shoot titles in 
Sans Serif typefaces
Take ten paces, and yell ""Fire!""
I nail you to a big board like Mel Kiper
No secret, I'll tell you why I smell wiser
I got a bunch of girls pregnant cause I sell diapers
And I'm a god-damned genius
The Marc Maron
 a dark-skinned art baron
Smart like lucky kids who get born to smart parents
Who feed them locally-grown farmer's market cart carrots
I eat fair trade cheese and fart fairness

I...go...Werner...Herzog
I...go...Werner...Herzog
I...go...Herzog
Which means I get large spread art cred smart heads are fed

Skip the introduction, buddy I'm not mingling
Hoes on my dick cause I look like John Singleton
Cut like Tarantino with his big-ass machete
Once I read my notebook, word to Nick Cassavetes
Twelve frames, half a second, Clockwork, Stanley Kubrick
A rap session I'll put my nose in, I can't be Buddhist
I learned my lesson, I'm really a savvy student
But dark like Tim Burton, and look fit like a thin person
But I'm just a happy human
Before I see a stupid rom-com with a nice chick
I might get, the right grip, to set up a light rig
Attach a 
GoPro
 to the po-po's nightstick
And assault him with an icepick -- and ask him how he likes it
Excuse me -- unhhh -- my swag sharted
I feel like Shaft with a shag on shag carpet
These rappers aren't factors they're actors with no SAG cards in
They think they're the truth but they that gossip rag garbage
Written shit or freestyle, homie I'm that murderous
Remember me? I used to enter them rap tournaments
Breaking niggas' spirits like a bag full of glass ornaments
Well bitch it's time to eat now, show me where craft service is
Thinking out loud like an introspective extrovert
If I play the background I'm directing, not that extra work
Bust that 16 but I decided to put in extra work
To make them strippers drop it super mega-low and extra twerk
Rappers say they don't hate, but most of 'em do
I feed off it like 
Vigo in Ghostbusters 2
I can roll up your crew, or throat-fuck your boo
Whatever transpires is so up to you
Lights Camera Action
The whip is fully covered so I might have to crash it
Getting southpaw HJ's from a right-handed ratchet
The airbag deploys
The credits start to roll
How anti-climactic

Much,Thumbs ,2015.0,"Um, who the fuck are you talkin' about if you ain't talkin' about us?
I go so deep, you know we don't sleep and I been awake for months
Going too dumb is our rule of thumb so, who is such and such?
My homies doing too much
Suit up, boot up, you what
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
Now you know all about us
We doing too much, now you know how to go like this

Imagine, the day you win, they gonna say you way too lit and exchange it quick
Recall the awkward dude who I once was
They stretch that swagger into metadata in the rumor mill
Now you got your syndicated show and your movie deal
But ladies say your music kill, but you can't pass no background check
And you may have a boarding pass to hop up on that outbound jet
But you're doing too much
Let me show you how to
With a little artful solo we can all play Marco Polo
With the creation myth, the bits between your ears ain't jailbroken
You may be doing way too much when executives say you suck
In the deal memo, in short hand, while the tour van got the tail smoking
The propagandists hate all this literary zest, and, my itinerary's in French
Because my past commentaries, that shit's incendiary at best
And you was each and every sense
And I'm the reason why you walking out
The only thing you talk about

Um, who the fuck are you talkin' about if you ain't talkin' about us?
I go so deep, you know we don't sleep and I been awake for months
Going too dumb is our rule of thumb so, who is such and such?
My homies doing too much
Suit up, boot up, you what
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
Now you know all about us
We doing too much, now you know how to go like this

And now you on the honor roll on the roll so you bricking jumpers
The unemployed black astronauts are out there stripping Hummers
But it ain't no big bummer, Barbara's the actress and mixing colors
But it's not like I grow weed to turn up all my Biofeed
I'm a wild steed
And I'm just doing all of my favorite stuff
And I'm doing too much
I may dislocate my rotator cuff
And I'm doing too much
I'm probably gonna get these Gators scuffed
I can rap so pimp, tax exempt
Whoa
Me branching out is tantamount to an overflow, I played electric blues in dress shoes on the corner store, so spread the news
Checking some coffee brand I end up getting body scanned
On the way into Nottingham, they've criminalized my negritude
I'm just doing all of my favorite stuff
And I'm doing too much
I may dislocate my rotator cuff
And I'm doing too much
I'm just doing all of my favorite stuff, yeah

Um, who the fuck are you talkin' about if you ain't talkin' about us?
I go so deep, you know we don't sleep and I been awake for months
Going too dumb is our rule of thumb so, who is such and such?

Ministry of the Torture Couch,Thumbs ,2015.0,"I just really wanted to be included in the conversation
My nigga, let me give you my thoughts on the matter

My introduction at the party was ""Who be that?""
With small talk littering conversation with booby traps
Chewing fat with political theorists busy reviewing stats
They're going home to niggas committing unruly acts
But not getting fitted for no Uzi straps
Just keeping the hoodie mac and the doobie wrapped
And never reflecting on how we truly act
They're screaming out that shit
Until the motherfucking tubing cracks
Cause it feels like a military coup in fact
But had to bring Paul Mooney back to give y'all the point of view
Of a threatening black man,
 cause these legislators get paid for the
Booty claps so I gotta bring the kufi back

So take a breath, take a step, take a leap
I'ma take these motherfuckers straight up out their seats check
Reach for the sun, I shoot from the hip with teeth in my gun

Remember when we were radicals out there fanning them flames
Rooting out injustices in our family names
Cops measuring our grave plots in candy canes

I motion to leave the party early
But held down by my sleeves, it's like a mild birthing
Pushing past the ledge to know I'm not free
Wonder if they'll remember me?
As something more than a centerpiece
Or a choir boy for the simile
For the four-fours, for the entropy
Like the chorus was always a friend to me
In migrant visions though -- my mind was a cash box
Followed behind grandpa in black socks, wild at heart
He smoking KOOLS, 'til the day of the locust -- moved
Him barely unfocused -- blue, but when I concentrate I'm scary with truths
Half-remembered from my ones and twos and fours of my past lives
A pastor in knife fights, a bastard, a light brite
I'm just babbling but what I found is our self-worth has been rooked
The truth we pull from our subconscious
Just won't read it in books

So take a breath, take a step, take a leap
I'ma take these motherfuckers straight up out their seats check
So just reach for the sun, I shoot from the hip with teeth in my gun

Don't you remember?
Remember us
Let me tell you about it
Remember when we were radicals out there fanning them flames
With a mouth full of reading and a tummy full of grain?
Don't you remember?
I was there with you
It was different then
We sung the old folklore, we sung the Goodlife hymns
My nigga said this one, and I repeated it. It goes:

Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
He's ready to drop a cop
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
I'm ready to drop a cop, he says
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
I'm ready to drop a cop
He's ready to do what you're ready do to but he's
Ready to drop a cop

I wasn't ready to do it, I was studying music to make y'all pop your top
Showing steady improvement, I calibrated every step of my awkward walk
I’m off of the coverage I’m combing the undertow, “where are ya wonder crops”
I'm celebrating all the over-medicated veterans indefinitely to have a better understanding
Of General Lee, and how he felt about the universe
 and generally
The same sentiment of bus unions, may categorize some blacks as sub-humans
We don't get down like that, the criminal intent of how I act
Got me discussing paramilitary tactics with a leftist weirdo on the census bureau
The crackling kinetic energy around them French braids comes from the planet's furnace re-purposed
For the hustle's various inertias I put the workers in burkas
For the political Whirling Dervish
My nigga free jazz's finances have overloaded them circuits
It's tedious selling them inebriates for the CIA achievement list
The edited gagged that failed Confederate flag draped over the petri dish
I remember when I was oblivious, a tight wad with an iPod
But then I got pulled over by them cops and got rolled up by the vice squad so I'm like
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
I'm ready to drop a cop
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
I'm ready to drop a cop, like he said
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
We ready to drop them cops
Down a few levels off our importance in society, nigga

Yeah
Woah
Goodlifers
Los Angeles
Nigga I'm floating in the sky above everyone
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
I'm ready to drop a cop
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop
I'm ready to drop a cop
Off the elemental table
Disable all of them motherfuckers and hook them niggas up with a USB cable
Right in they navel
Fuck a cop, fuck a cop

Let me show you with teeth in my gun
Let me show you with grief in my puns
We were different then
More in touch with each other
We spoke more often
We were more likely to go back home",https://genius.com/Busdriver-ministry-of-the-torture-couch-lyrics
Somethingness,Temporary Forever,2002.0,"Now this…this Busdriver name. What exactly are you trying to say? Are you trying to say that you're reaching out to your fellow underclassmen, your fellow proletariat, you're trying to bring them into the light?
(I'm saying nothing.)
I mean now, when you mean nothing, you don't mean 'nothing'! You mean it in a kind of existential, nihilist, Nietzsche type of way? I mean, tell me what's going on. Explain to me, brother. Explain to me
(Nothing.)

All I wanted was insurance and a dental plan
But ladies and gentlemen
All they do is grow daisies at a mental can
Get a job!
Easy for you to say, you're a member in some rap group, but at least I stood for something
I'm a baby in a trash hoop who's good for nothing

Now, upon buying this album you've done three things:
Proven that you're a hippie counterculture sun chaser
And proven that you're unaware of your contribution to my fundraiser
For me to rule the world, and you want to join the club?
To get a renewal, you need a referral from a previous employer
But we know you're a schoolgirl who needs a devious lawyer
To prove otherwise in a court of law. Get this nigga a sport's bra!
But that's besides the point
You've also proven that mundane tasks to you are like slave labor
So you don't do nothing
If you were in grave danger
Your problem wouldn't prove sudden
And went inside to wake up early you at the alarm clock and the snooze button in
If you were stranded on a deserted island you would probably farm crops and stew food hunted
You inspected all the fun and you laugh, thinking if things go according to plan
In the song, you'll be subordinate in a tanning salon
Wearing a white shirt, with cold air freezing
Drinking soft drinks, yet dying of thirst, but for no apparent reason
Well, what are your plans today? Well, I'm certainly not gonna do any of the house chores
But I think I'm gonna dabble and do up my dissertation that I'm gonna present to Al Gore
With an unpresentable mouth sore
About 'nothingness'
[
Cuts
]

There's nothing
Nothing that's better for enhancing the chance of being empty
And it'll hold a certain mystic freedom
And freedom is in a hole that people fall and die in

Record full of nothing but a bebop, an amoeba auction, a hummus falafel
A dick in the H in the Haitian abated
Graffiti verbatim preventative medicine
Preventing hip nethers I get up in her venery heaven
Adam and Eve are having a meeting with a cat so…so
Soulful with a bowl-full of no, no, no
Nothing…ever happens, here's a leather napkin
Riding on a killer wildebeest in the wilderness
Of the Middle East and back to Italy
To set this scene of nativity in the hills of Mississippi
With a dollar-fifty and a bottle of whiskey and a woman to bake me some biscuits and a little piece
Of Feliz Navidad, you never had a dad
So Tenenbaum or MacDonald after Ramadan
Fast enough to catch me placing those splashes, vagabond
Don't be laughing, you David Hasselhoff in a castle box
Castlevania building pencils in Pennsylvania with the stencil stain you'll love
End of the verse, so hand me your purse
I'm the one that you will see at the Italian Hill near you
See, I like at the opera where a life is a death, and I see that…the death is near
( And on a basketball court backboard is the head of a deer)

There's something I wanna tell ya
It's been eating me from inside out
Let's make it a point to get together sometime soon
And we'll talk
Come close enough so I can whisper
I've been meaning to tell you that
Oh shit I forgot what I was gonna say
Never mind

Hear my tummy moan!
´Cause I spit up all my vom, but you know I gotta get a muddy gnome from puppy cones
Before they know these songs are full of absolute nothingness
And contrary to popular belief, our lucrative rate is in grass root cuttingness
From CD duplicates burning I don't hatch bad news and a money clip
But I have a tumor, as seen of a baby's mother tit on the mammogram
A dozen mother ships plan to land, so I could melt the demand with heat-ray gun
Instead of going to midnight mass with DJ Run
Or rich white trash sedatives house a plum substance
In a pipe that announce me and cancer as husband
And wife, but I think I'm gonna get a second opinion
(our blood analysis finds there's nothing wrong!) so I'll get a third opinion
(there's nothing wrong with you)! It's just that my words are swimming again
I'm drowning in my swim trunks doing cover songs with Alvin and the Chipmunks
Holding a thousand pistol grip pumps sounding ""get crunk!""
At your grandmother's house doing nothing

""Go back to Compton, you dirty nigga, we don't sell watermelons here""
Is what I yell at the white folks on the way to gun show once a year
Nigga, some of my best friends are white, and I love mud sharks just the same
Except for the ones that come from Africa and got 'Johnson' for a last name
Darth Vader, Rhetoric, Earl Jones James, by the way
What's another name for shit-colored in German? Take a guess
Melanin

you illiterate knuckle-dragging ethnic thief two-fifths of a person
Civil servant, welfare undeserving, never own a suburban
Home, I hope they raise the rent so high
The crack money you make couldn't buy you better property curbside
In the game of monopoly you would advance to Run (not Boardwalk)
You hide as her pitch-white map cause your corn-fed pig wife gave you penis-envy over the pony in the barn
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. Bestiality porn (don't watch it)
Defecation porn (don't watch it). Shit-face drunk from cow-tipping last night
Your version of crackery is reminiscing on an umbilical cord before you had to pay for the rock and hit the glass pipe
Yeah, let's talk about civil rights. A 'spic straight from the chop-shop put together wrong'
If ever there was a Mexican Transformer he would be a lowrider named 'Wetbacktron'
Con artists hit the stopwatch and let's play a barbed wire game
Of turntable hopscotch in the form of a swastika

There's something I wanna tell ya
It's been eating me from inside out
Let's make it a point to get together sometime soon
And we'll talk
Come close enough so I can whisper
I've been meaning to tell you that
Oh shit I forgot what I was gonna say
Never mind
 (Busdriver)
All I wanted was insurance and a dental plan
But ladies and gentlemen
All they do is grow daisies at a mental can
Get a job!
Easy for you to say, you're a member in some rap group, but at least I stood for something

Stand, pause, turn, turn
Stand, pause, turn, turn

I'm gone
After you said what you did
There ain't no way I'm coming back
Spill the wine
Return the gifts
I'm out of here

(Let me explain)
(Let me explain)
I don't want to ruin your ball-gown
Because I'm not feeling law-bound
You can probably coffee-grind by body-mind into a psychotropic compound
An ice age will thaw before I'm able to play ball
Your cryptic texts aren't state law
Yet read like an algebraic scroll
But I know you're gone
After that gut wrenching shout match
And my out of whack palm read, got me on leave
In this outback with some lounge act
But don't crossbreed with my ennui it's a mousetrap
For the besmirched and weakened
I'm like a jerkhead telling you to twerk for the church of England
My advice stay so socratic, don't panic if I'm looking like a dope addict
Because I'm depressed as shit
Knowing that my capricious lover is a migrant bird
Your absence caused quiet stirs
That progressed into a violent dirge
Of victim blaming and miscellaneous quips to prove that my discourse's boyish
I had my heart explained to me
I was drawn to quarters by hoarse voices
But you forgot to listen to me when I said

I'm impossible to love and cannot keep an open mind
So you left me where I was
Shredded in your motion lines
(x2)

We never touched on it, touched on it
What we left
To be in love and treated love like a brush with death
We never touched on it
(x2)

This shit is depressing, man. Get over it
Slice at the knuckle where the mind bends
And I become a motherfucker fucker times ten
Crisis all look enormous when your body suffers a sugar shortage
I'll cook a swordfish or prep any gourmet platter to stimulate your gray matter
Girl, this rap shit left me worse for wear
And I ain't got that perfect hair, my love feels like a cervix tear
But you kissed me by my desk light
Cause you're looking like my next wife
Cause you're looking like my next wife
Cause you're looking like my next wife
I'm here burning midnight oil
Soaking gravitas into cotton swabs
In return I get tight coils of human waste as toothpaste
Oh I get it, I'm old news, a motherfucking brontosaurus
And to think that I invited you to my underwater forest
A thousand fuck-you’s sprung-loaded in a balled up fist
I open my palms and my eyelids become two devolved pussy lips
And I deserve it",https://genius.com/Busdriver-motion-lines-lyrics

Ohh

Hi, I'm Regan
I don't rap for free
And listen I’ve got a bachelors degree, but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become
This year my pigment’s bluer
What am I, a crip from hoover?
Oh no, It’s a malignant tumour!
Oh, I knew it. Come on!
And still you never would admit how sick I’ve become
(Second Interlude)

This is ""Perfect Hair"" by Busdriver
It costs .146 million US dollars to make
The musical accompaniment on tracks 5 through 12, cost 6000 euros each
The backup singers used on tracks 1 through 3, cost 3500 US dollars per take
The studio time at our home studios cost half a million Brazilian reals per lockout session

I'm a frequent flyer
And a decent liar
And that's a lie in itself but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become
I eat my food raw
Grew up bourgeois
Now I run game like a cue ball
But you knew that, come on
And so you'll never admit how sick I've become
I'm not a cool dad
Nor a new fad
I'm my daughter's own private enigma, come on
And still she never could admit how sick I've become
I'm dope as fuck
I know what's up
And I did not blow up but you knew that, come on
And so you never would admit how sick I always was

My clothes are dirty
And I'm over thirty
And you can't quit me cold turkey but you knew that, come on
It's about time we've admitted how sick this has become
I'm no one
And everywhere I only breathe heavy air
But you knew that, come on
Why can't we admit how sick this has become?
I used to wake up at noon
To punch the moon
And fuck my life in her puncture wound
Come on

Come on",https://genius.com/Busdriver-retirement-ode-lyrics
Unemployed Black Astronaut,Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon
(Quite possibly, one of the great all-time love tracks.)

It's the resurgence of the happy black rappers
But our African medallions are handicap placards
I am alphabetized in the modernized retro
And my press photos are wallet sized. My rent's low
Why don't you shape me? I'm malleable flesh and putty
And a salad bowl with dill dressing
And assimilated into urban field testing
Dress and doggy are coveted by a sexy bunny
Afraid I'll add her to my burlesque show
Who severed the ring finger of the lead singer and store a fresh bowl
Of the Bitches' Brew with bee stingers but I'm refreshed though
It's home of the black speed reader
Perplexed or blurb stretched
Dude adjusted I am spacey but the burden is low
Which means I'm commonplace
Til the boy and me traveled the country in wooden spaceships
On the phone cussing at de-booking agents
I wield words that have come from the country with the underground who's-who
But I feel like I've been sodomized with a billiards pool cue

I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace
I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace

It's the return of the all-popular dope rappers
Who retreat to their holes in the sky, climbing up rope-ladders
And I will sell you a silver disc soaked in laughter
Cause you've been brainwashed. Out of your ears leaks soap lather
Why don't you deify me? I'm Buckaroo Bonzai
Don't know what to do, I'm the wrong guy
I touch crews like Krush Groove on DVD
And I kinda started doing songs with CVE
But now you're like (Chillin' Villain who? Project what?)
Persona Non Grata with the wrist-band in front of Popsicle stick man
He's a wall of hot lava. Drip crayon on your clipped glands
So I found the top dollar. Twist strands to enrich fans
But there's not a lot of offers. They give brands to kitsch bands
I water lawns for the ADD D&D role-players
And we got along, so we formed a commonwealth
And you hear me do random sightings and file-sharing
And you tell me that song writing's like child bearing
No it's not, it's self indulgence
Elfen culprits watch their egos melt in charcoal pits

I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace
I am the first black astronaut
To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape
And put them sound asleep in the fireplace

Oh my. Sorry I left my acceptance speech in the back of the private car
And I re-wrote the Hollywood ending flux the motion-picture screen
Made it so the black guy doesn't die by the opening scene
Oh my. Sorry I left my acceptance speech in the back of the private car
When I re-wrote the Hollywood ending flux the motion-picture screen
Made it so the black guy doesn't die by the opening scene

Yeah! This is the climb of the cathartic writer
That labels couldn't market they lifer
I've been out-sold and my styles are old and lame
I'll spark a lighter to the carpet fiber cause I'm not a household name
I'm a tax write-off, I signed a deal with no exit clause
My label's like Ms. Santa Clause on menopause, so I'm banging on padded walls
So I'm trying to make hits, but I keep hitting pop flys
I don't eat out any more, I thaw chicken pot pies
But I used to be in the list of the top five
Fresh hip-hop guys

To walk the bare moon, from my air balloon
Pound my beliefs into the desired shape

Casting Agents And Cowgirls,RoadKillOvercoat,2007.0,"Hey.... Hey.... Hey.... Hey..

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself

Girl, I'm a walking plane-crash to your moms and dads
Ostentatious and crass pulling the gauze
Off your scabs
Bitch, I negate the myth of the 'great black boyfriend'
In the Polaroid at the get-together
Wearing a corduroy vest-sweater
So don't get that engagement ring engraved
Cause before we met you thought
That hoodrats laid eggs
And that rappers were just sky-pirates with peg legs
But I kick it with you simply for the shits and giggles, playful innuendo’s
You thought
""He's just an uber-dred for the federal fiscal cap""
But after brunch, you'll need
Two Sudafeds and a disco nap
After I drain your insides with a crazy straw
You ain't my baby doll-
""Cuz Nigga you reek of coffee shop blend""
My body's a lollypop that caters to the
Miss polyglot’s whim
With addictive agents that outweigh oxycontins
And our phobias perfectly fit
It takes a quirky chick with curvy hips to petrify this working-stiff

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
While I'm still on the shelf
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags

I'll be today's avatar of the prefab
Then end up a child star in rehab
It's like a bed-and-breakfast
I'm sending a text message on my key pad
Saying, ""I have no more to say
To me ex-manager(slash)sea hag divorcee
Except eat shit and die""
My daily commute ends with a fender-bender
Cause no one acknowledges my ten-year tenure
I've got the know-how the thrill your scene
But they want someone lowbrow, a philistine
With iron-on irony for Viacom's white honkies
They'll send you a girl wearing
Tight thongs under nylon gi's
""Let's all hit!""
But I'm not for the gaudy gangbang
The thought of it turns my member to a soggy plantain
And shit, I get off on news leads
And you pet mouse meat
Set and poised with sex toys
In your penthouse suite believing you're Lou Reed
I spit used reeds out the wet mouthpiece
Even when sex appeal is taboo
Electric bills are past due
My head is clear of engineered, election year snafu

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
While I'm still on the shelf
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags

I used to say, fuck it
Wouldn't placate the functionaries
Too busy making playdates with buxom secretaries
But I hope that my homies don't laugh
My choreographed dance steps
Are a little effeminate for a sociopath
We've been airbrushed so much we look like a claymation zoo
I'm a voice-over on your Playstation 2
But in my hey-day my ethical fiber
Would turn stages into firewood

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
While I'm still on the shelf
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags
They want an everyman milking the oldest gags
Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags",https://genius.com/Busdriver-casting-agents-and-cowgirls-lyrics
Colonize the Moon,Perfect Hair,2014.0,"I threw my hands in the heavens, I own what I touch
This world's big enough for the both of us, but for me it's not enough
So I gotta colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon, yeah
So I gotta colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon, yeah

If you were here for the last song about world leaders and street fashion
We bent the truth quite a bit, and would like to announce the following redactions
First, my homie didn't die violently but he died of laughter
Binge drinking on diet Shasta
He slipped and fell down the fire ladder, but why does that matter
Second, I don't make money like an NFL runningback
If I could really turn a jack-o-lantern into a sports car
Why's my driveway look like a pumpkin patch
Third, I'm not that leftist
I ditched that ultraviolet lambast
With a code of silence that co-pilots militarized unmanned craft
And fourth, your hair fuels life
'Til the moral standards became puree paste
Could've stripped us open with ? to the cavalcade's birthday cakes
And fifth, I don't think the country's run by blackened hellions
My business practices are Machiavellian
And a room for my throne of jagged skeleton
And six, I do recruiter overreaching my locals on every Mars rover
With QR codes for card-holders and product placement where your charted lobes were
And seventh, I can't agree with philanthropy of tycoons
Cause this money ain't made for saving children
It's to help me colonize the moon

So I gotta colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon, yeah
So I gotta colonize the moon, colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon, yeah

If you were here for the last song about world leaders and street fashion
We bent the truth like so, and would like to announce the following redactions
First, I think all your primitive poises are a pantomime's slow wank
That's why I greet 'em all with ""atta boy"", just a data point in the phone bank
Second, I do want your idea of new success to be crude at best
So when you hit those pratfalls insured by past laws
It won't be something even you can detect
Third, I do admit that sexual appetites conflict with ambition
But it's important that my life resemble Pimp C fan fiction
And fourth, I can assume the standing of finger point at an unfaithful man
When I'm a dog who feeds on excess that needs to express his anal gland
And fifth, I had to withhold
I never sniffed or sold a spec of coca
I'd be quarantined like I broke a fever
Or like a bloated diva with a leather boa
And six, our social fabric's been woven into some crazy polymer
With men in blue flannels and red flannels cooing death rattles through a baby monitor
And seventh, I can't agree with philanthropy of tycoons
Cause this money ain't made for saving children
It's to help me colonize the moon

All have done and all I've seen
Who cares about you
What else could I be
After all I've done and all I've seen
Who cares about you
What else could I be

So I gotta colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon
Colonize the moon, colonize the moon, yeah
So I gotta colonize the moon

Hey...

Cheeba cheeba, cheeba cheeba
I think it would be cheaper if I grow your cheeba
Hide your beeper, ride a zebra
I wonder why you glorify nine millimeters
If you shoot you eat it, you eat it, creep behind revolving doors
Wild on the floor involved in war
Or crawling on all fours... (gun control!)
Why would you pride yourself on being a luger-holder
When the only gun you've held is a supersoaker?
But I'm the killer finger without a millimeter
Look on your face look just like gorilla sphincter
When the NRA gave you the middle finger
Told you that you couldn't join the gun club due to your ethnic background
Said you were born from the septic trash mound
So put the gun back down
You may think you're tuff, bullet-proofed up
But the men that carry guns got mullets and crew cuts
White conservatives who form the oligarchy
Who'll call you darky, and hate commies and Paul McCartney
They're through nigga-shootin' at the general cinema
But the self image is a mental enema
Plus an exchange of gunfire
Is more likely to kill your man Busdriver

 Oh! goodbye cruel world
I'll never see my children or stuff again (""clack, clack""!)
Oh!, on a scale of one to ten, my life was... pretty good
I may be shot in any one of your city or hoods
Hey...
Bullets be ricocheting, bouncing off church bells
Fools be bailing, all you see is shirt tails
But me and my personnel... we got merch to sell
Besides violence in a public place don't work well
And this is a pouring rain putting out those warring flames
The warning shots in the air hit angels, now I got blood in my storm drain
Sometimes I run over woodland creatures and they become road-kill
But still fans stood in the bleachers, and come to the 'Blowed' still
But you, your overkill...
You want to shoot at recordable cds like they were clay pigeons
I told you I was ""babysitting"" and you thought I came back from a gunfare
But I'm really into childcare

 Ughh! Goodbye cruel world
I'll never see my children or my stuff again (""Arghh!"")
On a scale of one to ten, my life was a 30 below with a chance of showers
But yet I had the man power to sit in front of a mic stand for hours",https://genius.com/Busdriver-gun-control-lyrics

My witty thread bores your kiddy pool party
This self-absorbed crowd is dull and foolhardy
(get up) to face that’s like a homepage
(get up) in a day as long as a stone age
I’m a quadruped pulling your dogsled
Yet in my mind we are all dead
I’m always telling them to (get up)

And when you stray LA won’t take you back
I’m supposed to spearhead this Christian rap record
And not the musings of a winded fact-checker
So I feel about an inch tall
And I got pre-teens to enthrall
So I pimp all the cost shares, install the software
But still I feel like my back is against the wall
I’m always telling them to (get up)

By fingering warped fret boards
See we exploit our talents so we can raise kids
Like my homie Trey, he’s the poor women’s Taye Diggs
But when it comes to love I stain the bedding
Catching bouquets at the wedding
But this don’t go hand and hand with your Volkswagon van

Put a switch in their hips and a feminine sway
Just to convince the women to stay

Selling out like it was Christmas Day
And give everyone an admission to pay
For a tit in the face

What came first the chicken or egg
The twist in the fray, dissident fan that listens today
Dissipates visits and strays
What the fuck, did our whole approach to business decay?

We underused all the parlor tricks
Instead of talking about art and shit
I should have put my hardened dick
In the hind quarters of Time Warner

With your backup you know how the story goes
So before we know, you make the party blow
What’s that? You figure we should do it just because you’re getting 14 a brick
You said this while handcuffed to a hospital bed, hooked to a morphine drip
I met your criminality, and I don’t like a bunch of grown  cause you don’t know right

So the character assassination is bone deep
Cause the idea is if you don’t be seen, got no reads
So fuck your hyperbole
You wanna move into an estate home
But you can't get a bank loan with a gun charge
Plus, why would you give all the crack addicts punch cards?
And fuck all that shit you do
I can only make an expensive song
When you're vetted and incredibly slender
I'm getting audited as a celebrity sinner

(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
So miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole

You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)

Black Labor (as understood by Equiano),Thumbs ,2015.0,"Straight out of the wrong side of Leimert Park, this is the beginning of Equiano ultra

Equiano, a great leader
I got a start in Hollywood impersonating Jesus, playing Weezer
And now he stars in motion pictures for the white slavers
The main feature but he's Saint Peter, so benevolent
While bigots don't weather the blow backs
The initial cavities in snow caps
I want to start beat up aggressive scenes, never secure about their recessive genes
And I'm dressing clean, I develop my dreams in the same house my homie sold at, and you should know that
My niggas are ideologues logging on the saber rattle
So they not worth to you, we do not work for you
Yep, I came up on your favorite channel
So just watch us nigga, yeah
Let's go

I got that work, I got that free labor
So get at me later
I got them clean papers
I'm major
I got that work, I got that free labor
Get at me later
I'm full of weed vapor
I'm major

More work than you can quantify
Economists, they don't even want to try
I want to grab your brain, trying to catch my breath
While the powers that be exact my death
And never be angered by the anti-theft
Unless I agree to be a corporate sojourn
Change my ways to worship a proven
Take a lot of money so I forfeit a move ooh! Yeah!
But I don't got to do it, made a movie that they're playing in a multiplex
On the borderly of the Boeing jet
Still treble clefs on the dollar signs over my embezzled debt
Man, how can we restructure everything to keep the OGs set?
Y'all know the deal, relations all like happy whites 'cause they don't respect our body rights
And the militants of fascism spread like a zombie bite
And then the crown came between as the matter of crabs
How does Viacom keep this head of the staff against traffic drafts?
How can I speak to the scene as they amass
When the capitalist class plays capture the flag with basic needs
Stopped and frisked that's the racist need
I'm in a state of constantly dangerous greed so swap out them ABC's with 0's and 1's
And them euros well done
So nombre nah, them empirical Johns
 and I do satirical puns, but no, homie they're there
They're very brave so, so I don't misbehave

I got that work, I got that free labor
So get at me later
I got my clean papers
So major
I got that work, I got that free labor
Get at me later
I'm full of weed vapor
I'm major

I'm major, I'm major, I'm major, I'm major
I'm major, I'm major, I'm major, I'm major
I'm major, I'm major, I'm major, I'm major
Give me that work, yeah, give it up for free
So what? You're owed a hundred years of dividends and fees
And dance for my children, swinging from a tree
Dance for my children, swinging from a tree
(So far, I get up
So far, I get it up)

I don't need your mother fucking advice bitch nigga, now get the fuck out of my face before I sell your mother fucking ass for some cigarettes, bitch ass nigga. You want some advice?

King Cookie Faced (For Her),Perfect Hair,2014,"Intro:
(I told her I'd step outside of myself for her.)
Driver. You got that---
(You're much better when you're high.)
Uh, nap in a serpent's lair
You got that perfect hair..from a German heir
(She thought I was better when I was less me.)
Chorus thing:
It's her! You know her
Verse 1:
This is when she'll think I'm at my very best
This is when she'll rub up on my hairy chest
She'll think that I'm better than I really am
I go really ham, swing off the ceiling fan
Pundits say I'm partisan when I'm indifferent
Cuties think they fine china when they chipped dishes
The border agents think I'm shady when I'm cranky tho
Exes think I'm dating hoes I'm buying baby clothes
My lady got me gone off that cup of tea
And now them silly pawns they don't govern me
Now---
(my lady got me gone)
Damn
Chorus:
It's her! You know her
She's mine
Verse 2:
School tuition costs about a bus token
The rap game is permanently stuck open
I will spend most of my time insulting people
I will claim that all of us are multilingual
Man I can figure skate on black ice
Up on the interstate I jack knife
I don't think that I can lift a metric ton
But I think that I'll run into the setting sun
I get to be the nigga for a nano-sec
Yeah. I can do the right thing the wrong way
I can peel all the stressors from a long day
Bridge:
She loves me like she means it (4x)
Don't cheat
Chorus:
It's her! That's my girl!
Verse 3:
My cd thinks I'm picky when I'm spot on
I get credit for songs I'm not on
The beauty standards don't start at hot blondes
There is no way I am not on
My decision making is compromised
I can paint the autumn skies canvas wallet size
Hellfyre Club is my goto
You like me cause there's nothing that I won't do
Outro:
King cookie face. Can you tell it's me?
Can you tell it's me?

I use to flee the scene 'cause my scripted dream was too green to pick
My nigga's mugs is mean so my stump would lean, I believed I’m thick
Used to get double teamed to the bumblebees, had to pee on six
But they don't really fuck with me though I'm sucker free in my recent picks
My art degree on pinkish, the recent penis shrinkage
They won't believe my genius, my shits on Peter Dinklage
And all of my homies are political prisoners, medicine man who scribbled them signatures
And y'all are some digital natives who never did dirt on no physical havens
Kindergartners, up at the dinner parties being fickle with payments You often belittle the layman, mm
A cow wouldn't utter your scorn, do I cop or conform?
Manipulate thunderstorms
No more shucking corn

Ooh wee keep this between you and me
I done turned into a G
Ooh wee keep this between you and me
I done turned into a G
Make you see what I see
Ooh wee keep this between you and me
I done I done I done I done I done
Ooh wee keep this between both of us
I never put nothing over us
 my flows when now or never, oh!

You see my baby mama only loves me for my father's money
But I got  wad of twenties with my college buddies like
And they kept it  slur
 hammer of the dulcimer
Panorama bandana  smoke 
If did it all again never vote for her
So I read intellect always interject on my rove and passions
While the local sets have to lament on the homies passing
People sing for the burrito king free of all charges
So the state of art scape
Park is why I fought the harvest and ball the hardest

Ooh wee keep this between you and me
I done turned into a G
Ooh wee keep this between you and me
I done turned into a G
Make you see what I see
Ooh wee keep this between you and me
I done I done I done I done I done
Ooh wee keep this between both of us
Identify nothing over us

21 Jump Street, have you wheeze when everyone stomps?
Talking one call that sauce, specially when it come to that pump
But your bro don't know, get it sold on host, in this city make a bunch of nigga's foe
When the night so cold, you know
Lorde Fredd33 see the fucking world blow
Lazy niggas, crazy bitches, empty clips, and baby pictures
Told the pastor save the scriptures for the hopeless masses
Rappers act just like my son, he swear he independent
But when shit get real he call on daddy wipe his little ass
I ain't got no time to fuck around
You niggas count and say you want some deep
I got a trunk that you can drown in
Real North side shit going off
Know you wanna rep it but respect it
Fuck around and slide up on your guesses
Get to chin checking, get the message
Heard niggas tryna get back (get back)
Nigga you ain't tracked these miles
Better pick a whole new act
This is a life, not style
Cotton candy, sweet n' low, man you niggas tootsie rolls
Tootsie rolls, tootsie rolls

Ooh wee keep this between you and me

F.R.E Double D, add it up 633
Work, work, murk and repeat
Busdriver understand  a G
Cali on my mind, I need a trip
Searching for some new mentorship
Time to level up up in this bitch
Time to level up up in this bitch

I can do anything that I want
When I focus on a fixed point
I could bend a spoon, I could befriend the moon
I don't think you get the point
I could make reality submit to my will
A spiritual leader I  grill
At the Last Supper I split the bill
I blow my life into the slit of your gills
 and a lone strike
 with a phone wipe
My authorities authorized in drone flights
Over a Southern California snow fight
Or a harvest
Don't have the courage of a  pearl or the entire winter break
My dinner plates are dark creams
Outside of the art scene of your British mates
Internet famous I'm a cyber student
Turn the fan club to a fighter group
Fucking with the government cables under the tables from an inspired goof
My  always fire proof
My defective apprentice is a reflective surface
Telling me that I need to follow suit
'Cause my product turn my mind to goo
I can do anything when I

For the nuclear disarmament

I can do anything with a car battery, wind sail
And antiquated smart phone

(Look Out!)
Yeah
Oh Shoot!

I'm so hungry, man, I could eat the rich
Eat, eat, eat the rich
Check me out

Things are looking good, but I can't mess with your hair though
Ergo, the ladder climb is an air show
But thank God you like I'm fucking with that hood shit
And treat me like you think I wrote up the instruction booklets
The instruction booklets, the instruction booklets
Cause of my home, the hammers pop
But your selfies look like glamour shots
Before that endorphin high, I take orders like George Takei
And scorch the sky, poor guy, I'm a horse fly and that's because

Let's eat, Kenny
Celebrate a little bit
Let us not eat them
Celebrate if you eat, nigga

On high booty cheeks, y'all are thieves
Swallow new acts, how to rap
Don't let them style with child proof caps
You there? I'm a rough approximation of Type A
And Type B at a dice game in a white tee with a nice chain
And snarky web presence you can't turn up in a text message
Without at least a million video views
Watch the millennials brood
Make sense of it all, there's diamonds in the loaves of bread
I'm looking for 'em in the hood like a floating head
Like a floating head, like a-- like a floating head
My dinner prayers meant for an asteroid wake
I'm reading that shit from a fat boy's tape
I'm still eating, nigga, but it's all soy-based

Let's eat, Kenny

Along Came a Biter,Temporary Forever,2002.0,"Everything's great up until you show up (x5)

Force fit murders and corporate mergers
Are so ""New world""
Horseshit burgers keep force, and click cursors
Make you so ""user friendly""
Compassionate conservatives who get maximum superlatives
Is so ""Neo-Reaganomics""
(there are certain no-no)
Claiming ownership of this Pangaea puzzle piece
Is so ""English settler""
Oh la di me on my out of body body builder's muscle beach
Is so "" Out of character for you
Seeing you underestimate how government officials furor and decimate
Is so ""up your alley""
And other world variety packs with apocalyptic anxiety tax
Is so ""1999""
So typical (you are)
Now this for obscene language and loud music
Which are now news clips of social under rest
But it's a crowd-shooting mix
Cause i redden all the rubber flesh, I'm hunted by Boba Fett's
And these are the minimal of substance
I'm the political pundit, I'm cynical and unfit
For day to day life I've got a pitiful pun kick
But at least I'm not on that criminal thug shit
Then they hide the doors that rape states right

And it was great and it was cool
But then along came this biter
And he was so out of touch
So completely self indulgent
Just so out to lunch
So in desperate need of a style of consultant and some school enrollment
People need help...

(Yea)

Now those recorded on toaster ovens doing their over dubbing
Is so ""20th century""
Giving style biters harsh pile drivers
Is so ""me""
This machine kills fascists and other unwanted guests
Now when I improvise showers risk the skies from brain storm rain clouds
I'm Coltrane and Kurt Cobain's brain child
And you're soaking wet, wanting to use these rap sounds for your bath towels
My moods for a chin check, I'll give you this crank valve
So you can smoke it in a black and mild and feel at home
TV sprout seedlings that cheer bling bling (bling bling)
And also force feed
Footage of bombs over Baghdad
To distract from my palms over scratch pads

And it was cool hunky dory
I wasn't hungry or horny
But then along came this biter
And he was so out of touch (so completely)
So completely self indulgent (totally)
Just so out to lunch (out there)
So in desperate need of a style consultant and some school enrollment
Style consultant school enrollment

Yeah
Do-do

Idle Chatter,Temporary Forever,2002.0,"Every minute people die and
Every other minute people are born
How did you spend that minute and
What was your involvement in either or?
There's secret wars
Radioactive fallout
Poison seeps in your pores
So keep indoors
I would give you more details
But I really have to be on my way
Go ahead and run
With your CD player as your escape pod
Your unfaithful god is your paycheck from your day job
But life spits on your eyes
Of you fleeing TV-land's compost heap
Be the apex of chaos
Have safe sex with stray dogs
Until you age fully any skin cream
Will turn a Cindi Lauper into a Cindy Crawford
But won't tell you could be eaten alive
At any city block or dive by mosberg
Isn't self-pity awkward when your inner voice is a songbird
Muffled in your beliefs are incomplete crossword puzzles
And your self conscious aquifer's been drained to a water puddle
I would love to sit and chat, but I got to be on my way
Sorry I don't have the time to shoot the breeze or chew the fat or choose the fruits up in the trees and I lose track
You want a bright future to be pitch black, so I got to be on my way
I'm sorry there's no time allotted for your hijinks
So you should be fly-swatted at least that's what I think
Go ahead and spend but the dollar bill is nature's suicide note
Seek refuge at late hours in the Mayflowers
Like goin' from bottled cans and holograms to cities full of Robocops who bleed soda pop
The good beauty and is why (??) love is a photo op and LA's patron saint is a coke rock
Even the stars in the penthouse become sparse when I do another head count
But it's a good day to die and I've been diggin' a ditch
So I wave goodbye to what didn't exist
With demoralizing the democratic demi-gods I get a pedagogue
And dog fights all in my steady job its to break your fault line
When its all dark and call a ball or strike in the ball park
You forgot a small part, the reverend signed with the swine therapists in the asylum
You would be embarrassed if I died young
Maybe because you felt that Meredith was a shy nun
And you just took credit for which when she was high strung
But you didn't know from terrorists she'd buy guns
When you knew too much she threw you off the terrace when you tried to run
Luckily a cypher full of whack MCs broke your fall
Now you cherish the rise of the sun after that close call
And cherish what I said most of all
I would love to sit and chat but I've got to be on my way
I'm sorry I don't have the time to shoot your breeze or chew the fat or choose the fruits up in the trees and I lose track
I want a bright future to be pitch black so I've got to be on my way
I'm sorry sir there's no time allotted, therefore I had to fly swat it
I've got it, Driver's fiber optic is really a fine tuned instrument
Implement several intimate moments tween you and your loved one
Thugs come from far or near, all with their scars, then leave tears
Comin' down their cheekbone, you seek the clones
What about speak in the zone, that is unbelievable
And California needa get a beach comb
To find the edible tidbits and little bytes and gigabytes of information
A megabyte a betcha byte a bigga bite when you come here
But I'll stretch your life out in a long time sequence, long term
Strong germ, that's what I am
Analyzing every petri dish
You know that I'm so secretive

Avantcore,Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"I know this group and they're so avantcore
I bought their shit at the mom and pop store
And I give all of their songs the top score
I'll see them play on their small hip-hop tour
They're treated like sex symbols, out the stretch-limos
Autographing breasts with lead pencils
Now everybody thinks that they're the best new group
As if they're a pop band test tube fluke
They bought a home that's the size of a ballpark
You can only cross the property with a golf cart
But they no longer can sell a billion records
Because when they first weren't trying was their last brilliant effort
Rappers say the darndest things that you'll ever hear
Like ""I heard you sold this many units"" and I say ""wish me better luck next year""
There seems to be too much water pressure
Underneath your genre-mesh blur
And to be honest I never took interest
In the modern day Young Black Teenagers
I'd thought they'd gone away replacing
What's on gun racks with cheese graters
To use on the spongy mind
Of the LA rapper swinging from a monkey vine
Style biting used to result in a money fine, but now
Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like I'm edgy and I'm risque and I say better luck next year
I replied to the wuss with a yo mama's joke
When he said how much he pushed the envelope
A group of 
sexually ambivalent nihilists
Crying from an ovarian cyst
Picking at a vegetarian dish
Idolizing a German band that barely exists
But me, my name's never on the full-color flyer
I'm just the dull Busdriver
Thinking 'til my head is a bowl of dust fibers
To all the fools up under their trucker hats
Sagging until you can see their plumber's cracks
There is no metaphorical meaning
So don't bother sifting through the storyboard in one seating
It's just horribly demeaning
And you can't do burners
I want the colors back
Don't want to hear your dumb ideas
Just shut your trap
Jumping jacks thunder claps in your bubble gum raps
Rappers say the darnedest things that you'll ever hear
Like ""I did a song with so-and-so and I got signed"" but the checks will never clear",https://genius.com/Busdriver-avantcore-lyrics

Kinesthetic grind fine-tuned into divine fact
Black lacquer shine, yup, that's that tacker tactile
Jamming at the crack of functions, shooting them late
Even at night their ghetto bright so we get lunch, we get fucked up off of love

And in saying that, you know, welcome to my rap jam

In eyeballs their bi-laws are leaping off the laser scan
Into your genotype telling you to deepthroat pipe
If you don't do it well, these hoes might
The 
red carpenter's
 quota fills the deficit in motor skills
Of on-lookers raw sugars register at overkill
Within your colon wall so a candied bowling ball
You squeeze out at the open call but what if you could
Inundate the open hearing with your shrewd barbs
That perforates the sloganeering on the cue cards
Would you prize that fine cut or just apply blush
As besquelched sea-kelp nibbling on pie crust
The job offers for Albany's count Dracula
And calorie-count spatula kitchen staff
Are on the lithograph
Of your Calvin Klein alkaline-enriched gonads
Should I kiss your ass or drown you
In the saffron soy dip
But my Zaxxon joy stick pokes at my
Glitter-spackled tight jumpsuit
Mr. Applewhite grunt pukes
From the candlelight-drunk seldom-sung suit

Stuffing YouTube viewership up deviated septums
Between two, choose your pick: Rule Zimbabwe
Or improved computer chips become your new Yahweh

Because most rap careers mirror stints as drug mules
But are you that pickaninny, blackfaced Ren & Stimpy

On the construction paper with the pastel sticks
And I'm a left-of-center loyalist

And yell out to me, and yell out to me
And yell out to me, and yell out to me
Cause I was the cutest kid who blew the wigs at music gigs
Yes I am the future nig -, you know how Driver does

Wake up, I know you see me when I'm on the road

Is it cause of how I fit my hood in a turn of phrase?
Is it cause my niggas know this world's a perfect cage?

This shit that I'm involved in, I used to revolve around it often
Now we the small talk of the big town, that's small talk with tall box
When they sit down, do you get it now? Make it legit now

I mean I know I always say some dumb stuff like this
Only I would leave the house dressed like this man
You could tell it's me

I rep that L.A. nigga without the mineral peel
Hopping off those minstrel's heels, my dap hand stays upturned
I stuff urns with buzz terms cause I'm crazed
Cause I'm crazed, cause I'm crazed
I show off signs of dementia, just throw my mind in a blender
Me and my niggas was often used as target practice
Without no troop aid in spacesuit grade starter jackets
But we did our shit anyway, we did our - the way we wanted
I'm from Hellfyre Club my dude
I'm from Los Angeles homie

Full of olive pits and wine corks
Own my judge and high court
And you’re all hung, you’re all hung

The cobwebs in your shadow, gotta dabble with your nerve center
When your life is derated
And you’re feeling isolated, that’s when you become a bird letter

Eating asparagus tips while obscuring that money pit
You were still a televised veteran

My son asked me what a nigga was,
 and if I was one was he one too?
And what it meant to be of nigga-stock
How can we define this nigga that we resemble
Or are qualities lost in the abstraction of prayer
Did we become or were we always this, and what was this?
Where did the border between us and the world merge?
No one knows
Thankfully we do know the storms that forge the idea
The definition is uninterrupted
The nigga is the variable
The nigga is the unknowable

Rocking a fresh Sam Kinison coat and beret
High School pep rally yelling vote for

Dark poor and lazy
Till I dye my eyebrows like Martin Scorsese
And all of a sudden y'all respect my art form, crazy

Started a new food service called ""Chicken and the Crumpets""
Saw ya moms and guitars sitting licking on the trumpets (oh)

Feeling so inadequate on a stretch of Crescent heights
Those aren't stars above me man, those are check your engine lights
And all of my fondest memories compressed to precious megabytes
So I mad to christ tabs
As I address heads on pikes
Everybody's been sentenced to death in the computer lounge
My lady’s got serial numbers scrawled on her pubic mound
Dance crowds wearing death shrouds roaming in this music town
But another pollutants dissipate when I'm zonin'
My nigga it all makes sense when I'm zonin' (left alone)
And all my time is spent treating home studios like panic rooms
So rare and colorful pantaloons that turns into a pay day
Now I vay-cay in the Cameroons
I grew flowers in the sand and do 
So on my face the camera zooms
But when the cloud of antimatter bloom
Was from a wasted afternoon those florists become fascist goons

Mocking army brigade verve

Shunning pop art in your turtle-neck

Yet no relief monies are en route
You exchange wistful ki-bi-bos while they prep the missile silos

You brown-nose but your downloads only show marginal growth
Why do you dress like a lesbian welder?
Only a middle-aged woman looks sexy in elk fur
You get injured at the hipster bar
I hit you with a ninja star and then I speed off in my car
My life is like a day-to-day porn shoot
You'll mayday for more troops when I say ""Sorry Fuckers""
See that girl, she's a great lay with her scorched roots
Plus she's got a grade-A horse caboose
That's my lady! I just squeeze her cheeks
While you sit and twitch like a Jesus freak
You're from Hollywood; you get your sphincter bleached
Sit your ass home and eat your quiche
I'm the dude that your chick would be pleased to meet
She'll want to suck me off with those beaver teeth
But I decline the offer. I drive a flying saucer
To perform on neighboring moons
And do the giddy-up with some iffy slut
Who's drinking pick-me-ups out of those Dixie cups
To the young boozer, and the drug user
Put the syringe on the baking teaspoon
That means play this it'll spike your blood sugar
I'll have your soulmate tied to the subwoofer

Sorry fuckers, you squares fucked up
Plus your haircut sucks, watch your girl upchuck
Sorry fuckers, we get their thumbs up
Make 'em cry bleed, dry heave
Sorry fuckers; we'll extract the bitch in you
Sorry fuckers, and dictate what you listen to
Give them face time with unloved ladies' men
Eschewing life through a dumb '80s trend

With a litany of pop culture reference points
My tenor voice will make the women all wet and moist
You act gender bent
While I'm wrestling with women in boxers with leopard print
And yes, that's me arching a pouring glass at the tee off
Me getting the boarding pass at the kiosk
Me eating fish with French cream sauce
Being celebrated at the confetti toss
I'm waving from the Project Blowed parade float
Completely nude under my raincoat
While you're in your backpacker entrapments
Battle rapping with a series of gay jokes
You're welcomed to peep game
But when they start riding the jock they seldom deplane
A deceased cock, a pudding geyser
The hung dong's the swung baton of the womanizer
But for my bitches it's a springboard
To a place where dreams are forged
And I'll smack these geeky young twerps
Out of their medium shirts

Yeah you got Gandalf's dick
My game gets night vigils
On a kill streak I make two freaks suck like I sell icicles
When I tell you bite the nipple
With my speaking voice the seat gets moist and the cellulite wiggles
It looks like whales bathing
I get the clit excited and I get cited for tailgating
Make that booty drop
Girls in Montana I got them on camera like a movie prop

Obama kills a hundred people via cellular phone
Simply by summoning all the predator drones
To vaporize an inactive base camp
World stage faceplant

That couldn't give a policy maker a leg cramp
But is called a gay tramp by the Texan lethal injection state champ

When I keep pushing on the seat cushion I field those cries for help

And we're on one
Like we're knee deep in drug-vending, fuck lemmings whose love spending gives us the best things
Like a J down the space suit of sweat stained
The undercovers gave me a cute pet-name
Now I'm being targeted by jet-plane
Because I'm so motherfucking subversive
With excessive panache I'm dressed in a sash
My name is a number, an X and a dash
Embedded in mass who stole all the savings and had sex with the cash

Now I'm locked out of all of my vivid scapes
And the capital gains is a Christian faith
Of the livid apes, staying in debate
Over the unhappy lives that we have to live
But we still do it, eating inkjets, building swing sets from dragon ribs
All the internet chatter is a by-product of my madness
Turning me into a vapid and glib capitalist pig
I didn't notice until now that a shoe's a phone
For what reason would any tycoon atone?
But for me to find money I need to get a dune combed
Because I'm so motherfucking self-destructive
I'm caressing a rash from a decadent past
My judgment calls are second at last
I'm rendered in ash when I ingest the asp

Indicative of an atypical mic-smashing

Paralyzing psychoanalyst, magnetizing soul catalyst
Out of a cocoon a platoon would form and how did it happen
Sprouting like alfalfa poison mushrooms out of the grass
Boys to men of this vast network of allies
That were sent to the rally point for the joint venture
Henchmen with a long-standing friendship
Based on both surviving a lynching from those striving against them
Rise to any length spread through every width, area, and circumference
It's a heavy load to lift but I was never known to quit nothing
I use a dolly, pulley, lever, conveyor belt
On the assembly line where all of the steel melts
I'd weld them a chopper, tap on a chakra to get 'em back in order
And mail them a document to tell 'em retreat back over the border

For our styling cipher out for the Driver

Take you time, make it fat, talking shit, take it back
Mad when you kick that crap
Weak wack raps, where the real writers at?
Over here, over there, everywhere that I peek
Follow the elite, every style that I freak
Beat a nigga down when I'm bound to a beat
Microphone parts what they found in the street
Pick 'em up, dust, kick it up, time to rip it up
Having fun with my tongue, when I'm done give it up
Time to demonstrate how I penetrate
Hot incinerate, biting like a dinner date
It's a twist that I missed, what part of the game is this?
Where the losers go and the winners wait
To take the beginner's place
Keep my face placed on how to win the race
If they'd run, I would never chase
Hit 'em with the boom because they set up base
This ain't Texas but this is the west's Chainsaw Leather Face
Keep the golden mic in a leather case
And when it's battle time, I'ma set a pace
Every line that you find already been mine
When you rhyme, man, what a waste
You would think I'd busted a nut in every hip-hop slut
Because there's too many Mini-Me's
And some of y'all cats is finicky
So y'all quickly change to enemies
Blowing up in the industry so they remember me
In their memory for original chops

Happiness (’s Unit Of Measurement),Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"Well you burst on the scene
Already a legend
The unwashed phenomenon
The original vagabond
You strayed into my arms
Yeah I told this one guy that my record's name is Fear of a Black Tangent
And he was kind of offended and he was like
What like I can't be down cause I'm not a black guy
I was like no it's not really like that it's just

Hit the switch, the DJ plays the fine dish and adjusts the high-pitch level
Hint to miss, hand your girl the wine list, she smells of hibiscus pedals
Whiff the grit, 
I show up with my rhyme clique, not in designer fit dress codes
Get a wince, and 
they think we're timeless and starting singing along to our pirated down loads
Admit the shit, I've never really been that social, most the times I'm disheveled
Is this it?, since it's Fear of a Black Tangent, do I got to call white kids devils?
It's the pits, or 
do I got to say nature's ovaries are bleeding at a poetry reading
The kids are pissed, because the thoughts of an underground rap guy don't really go that way
The kids are pissed, I think the mainstream vs. independent argument is so passé
Pick my disc, thanks to my 10 stack-high cd duper, I'm an uneasy sleeper
Get this, but a pacified TV viewer, read about me in a weekly reader
Fix the myth, and he said I'm a hip-hop treaty breacher with my vivid tales
I spend less time alienating my audience then I do trying to solicit sales
So lick the dick, because the scene is more than bitches, brew, and stinky reefer
It's a trip, all the pee-wee leaguers kiss rings on our pinky fingers
We spit the hits, but why? I am meaningless product on a crowded shelf
A shout for help, I simmer in my dilapidated glee
Oh get an account with a popular hip-hop crew, pay the activation fee
And buy a shirt, a hat, a pair of underwear, cuz that's your favorite emcee
And I'm a spacey shoegazer who stares at Pluto
, 
but I'll be a jiggy jigaboo
Who goes through laser hair removal if it means that I could pay my rent and other bills

I've got a point system that determines my happiness
Its unit of measurement is your interest in my crappy shit
Because I'm not dope, I'm not fresh, ideas are overshot and undersung
What a dumb verse that is, I'm definitely not number one
A verse drowning deep within my flooded lung
A song dying deep in a pit of my blood and cum
The kids don't want to listen, they just want to have some fucking fun
Fit the niche, a Hollywood entertainer will take a Xanax like a chewing gum
Hit and miss, they're in outlandish debt and their planned text is crude and dumb
A business risk, you know having a quality end product should be the rule of thumb
Fix the shit, but it's obvious the culture's been raped, it lies in a pool of cum
Quit your shift, so I'm up early working while you're squatting in Pilates class
Listening to Morning Becomes Eclectic and nodding to Johnny Cash
A nigga's pissed, but I don't have the same reservations that a closet Nazi has
But I'm as angst-ridden on Thanksgiving as you are
When your favorite rapper gets dissed on an opinion-based site
You're a hippie who don't know what chicken tastes like
Telling me who to pattern my career after and who I'm sounding like
Hey why don't take your self-absorbed ass and hop on your mountain bike
And go start a cipher at your parent's summer home on the veranda
Because you bite about 20 styles per stanza, but who cares
Because I'm frustrated, my records don't sell, and I can't seem to book a decent gig
And my indie label is understaffed, and these midi cables won't connect the drum pads
To the PA system, and my deejay's missing, and I'm barely able to feed my kid
And I hate my pad, I don't want to visit, I need to put new brake pads on my Honda Civic
I need an office visit from a known producer to do a remix
But it's hard to recoup when he's paid
And I'm starting to shoot my screenplay on Martin Luther King Day
So I'm basically over budget and quite screwed

I've got a point system that determines my happiness
Its unit of measurement is your interest in my crappy shit
Because I'm not dope, I'm not fresh, ideas are overshot and undersung
What a dumb verse that is, I'm definitely not number one
A verse drowning deep within my flooded lung
A song dying deep in a pit of my blood and cum
The kids don't want to listen, they just want to have some fucking fun",https://genius.com/Busdriver-happiness-s-unit-of-measurement-lyrics
Right before the Miracle,electricity is on our side,2018.0,"I am calling out your name
In the dark as the wind swept

Keep all them griots outside of the poorhouse

No can you
No, you don't really know the content of Plymouth Rock
You can't really understand hip hop

You can't really squander what's due
When it comes from the old depot
You can't really be sold, you can't really be sold
You are an essence that is infinite, infinite

From Sudan
Came in a sedan, can you understand
There is no rubber band that will take you back to the point of origin
Like this
A motive is at the helm, when I'm at the helm
Can you understand what happens
When I start rapping, tapping into unbelievable black skin
Motherfuckin' griots into Manhattan
When I start chanting, you know exactly when
My black skin cracks you see

You understand that I'm a chief

Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
When I drop shit, I'm all that you ask about 
I made a big splash on the gossip column
When I hit the rock bottom
In the streets spending electric bills
I'm dumb enough to try and re-invent the wheel
Haters volunteer
To smear names on the blogosphere
Until they get what they want to hear
Oh yeah!
My outbursts set the bar high
Wildfires set with art supplies
I'm rotisseried in the MRI
They keep taking shots like bar flies
And I return fire
I return fire
I return fire
With rounds out the lips of a church choir
All the freaks in the seats need to keep engaged
So the intelligentsia acts barely drinking age

Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
When I drop shit, I'm all that you ask about 
If you think I've eaten my fill, well you've heard wrong
My stomach's only filled with bird song
My body's waste is like precious metals
So I walk around thinking I'm extra special -
But I'm the Antichrist
I'm the Antichrist
I'm the Antichrist
So what I say, it can't be nice
They eat shit sandwiches at the discotheque
And talk about me to keep their whistles wet

Bliss Point,Perfect Hair,2014.0,"All you do is harness
An electric impulse
As you plant that withering body
In the rich mulch
And just leave behind
That glittery hindrance
Exhume that body
Take your insides out
Then get those innards rinsed
Now you can talk about more pressing issues
Like what's up with the state of hip hop?
Where exactly is hip hop going?
And did hip hop have breakfast this morning?
Does hip hop really have the body type to pull off that outfit?
Who is hip hop dating?
A holographic rendered Pac?
Or what does hip hop check in the gender box?
And other inane fluff
Your mind becomes an arcane tusk
So what you inveigh stuck
And overrides the brain trust
(And I'm about to get so rough
I'm about to get so rough)
It's what you say when you come through door
Some like to
Shoot the unheard
In the theatre company
Of the plucked nerve
And then maybe you can access one third of your mind
Some like the
Recipes for what lightning eats
On characters of my typing teeth
So I stay a skywriting links
To you show you to
Your enlightened peak

We, we always knew
How to reach the bliss point

Ooh La La
Goo Goo Gah
Inter-a-personal
Coup-de-gras
Loosen sod
Under the
Gall-o-ping
Hoof and paw
New gods get
Huge applause
Plutonium replace
Unleaded fuels
And you're lifting from
Tepid pools
As all the
Wreckage cools
Now you're a
Happy fuck
Cradled in hood famous
Khaki cuffs
So when corporate
Lacky grunts
Violate antitrust
I won't back
Hydrofracked
Grounds under
White snowcaps

Scoliosis Jones,Jhelli Beam,2009,"Hi my name's Scoliosis Jones
I've got a comb over coif and a smoker's cough
I'm into motorcross 
and am a Planet Z3 colonist
And a self-taught anesthesiologist
I've got a corn ethanol powered copter pack
For slow nights I'm in old type in almanacs
My bandmates act like tasteful Swedes
With tweezed brows they seed clouds with dreidels and beads
So I gnaw on the nozzles for syrupy opiates
When the political climate is clearly Soviet
But my crackpot persona's an eerie cozy fit
When I cackle at the throws of the hedge maze
I used to stab niggers with quarter notes
And treat royalty statements like horoscopes
But my wonderland's been deforested and poached
And my groin gets bombarded with x-rays
I'm Scoliosis Jones
""We all laugh at your expense""
, fuck you then
Full of broken bones ""Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense""
In the headliner's Buck Rodgers seating wing
There's always blood on the toddler's teething ring
He needs legitimized conceit, cocaine nasal spray
Splayed cable bays to liquefy the heath
His personal assistants wear go-go boots and every vocal booth
Must have a glory hole
He's fellated by a roster of vapid poodles and eats apple strudels
Wearing a portly stole
A crass pipsqueek all slathed in bronzer
Picking out the pig's feet in the fattening curd cobbler
Flossing and stuff because he thinks we care
He signed a ten album deal with a pinky swear
Popular opinion's burgeoning gulf leans
To it's concerning his golf swing
My cardigan reeks in partisan pink
Because I'm Barton Fink in the Martian sphinx
I'm Scoliosis Jones
""We all laugh at your expense"", fuck you then
Full of broken bones ""Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense""
Pole vaulting over the exalted sultan of urban music
Because he's Nova Scotian
I am the script clinic for the post-millennial slacker biopic
Your pitch is impish full of skullduggery and slice of life dull cutlery
Twirl and flail around the motor fire and foreign policy deodorizer
I am the script clinic for the post-millennial slacker biopic
I'm Scoliosis Jones
""We all laugh at your expense"", fuck you then

Sphinx’s Coonery,Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"The world cannot be saved, children
Your hero's bloodshed is sponsored by the sphinx's coonery under the monster eye

Walk like an Egyptian
Keep some pep about your step
The petty thievery
A pet peeve to me
Grief over leaving me
Queasy, easily, measly, freebie Frisbee
Sizzles in cold stream wilderness
Epic, relic, medic, antiseptic tank quarantine
Celtic elfin magic melted in that kiln
Overwhelm your film
Hold the realm by the helm
Put you in a gimp suit plastic pillow case
Pimp loot prostitutes knock boots in duke shoot
Luke cute
Killing off shallow personalities
I rebuke on purpose
I set it, plan, and plot
Puke on planet Earth
If I was a fifth, you'd drink me
If I was a spliff, you'd stink me
If I was a myth, you'd think me
If I was a lift, you'd sink me
If I was a gift, you'd jinx me
Sphinx riddle as taboo
Culture clash bamboo
I'm a damn fool
The baby in your baby momma's belly got my sperm shampoo
If infant was hip-hop and womb of time recording room for rhyme
Leverage your average beverage
Severage causes heritage hemorrhage at a measure which the feathers itch
Gathers rich overages whether its reverence is togetherness
I never miss a chance to tether twist a stance
Fake independents take advantage of a zephyr kiss
The sound of their soul is tainted with devilness
 (2x)
Dying, we did it well
We put diving boards on the mouth of forever and ever
And MTVs reenact our martyrdom with marginal liberals but we're the artful pit bulls

Get the fuck out of my genre
It's my alma mater
Styles from my mama who do these piles of towels from a Ramada
Who think Illuminati but drink limonada
Persona non grata
Think there zoning on strata
Got a lot of Erik Estrada but not a lot of Akuma Matata
In and out of water like a piranha on a Prada or Dolce and Gabbana piñata
Waiting to Mexhale
Your girls in a Hyundai Excel
One lie away from writing me letters on Microsoft Excel
Cause and effect sales
Rhymes is ice in effect
Hail to the thief
Mail order some new teeth
Impailed through the Mexperiment
Underneath the burial reef
Carry a note and not a leaf
I'm an a anomaly
You're Amelie and you've got to leave
The dichotomy of your dye job is not godly
But oddly more runway modelly

I'm mistaken for the next Kool Keith
Because I interbreed indie rap acts and groom them at the pet boutique
But I'm stupid
I turn down test tube freak bleach blondes
Offering sex on a nude beach
To read palms for prep school geeks
Cause they sing along to each song
Why only do I appreciate the therapeutic properties of a sexy whore?
Is it because my vacant heart is a messy sore
Encased in an unrefined heavy ore?
It's exactly why jet fuel leaks out of my every pore
And rhymers can't even ingest the food I eat anymore
They would need six stomachs, a big budget and crisp hundreds
To bribe hand-picked judges
To share the winnings of the post-rap whiz kid
I'm a steaming blue baby
Hovering over a bigwigs business grid
My ideas go down smoothly
When you guzzle an Odwalla
My speech is littered with double entendres
And sharp sarcasm
I'm coupled with top sponsors
My tame ideas are on the wall of a chain of Ikeas

Your hero's bloodshed is sponsored by the sphinx's coonery under the monster eye
Your hero's bloodshed is sponsored by the sphinx's coonery under the monster eye

The older put the lesson plans in the song
The money changes, credit was long
The griot believed he had the leave to be loved
Welcome back home, yes

Yo, disembodied sexy legs
Poison pills with heavy glaze
Los Angeles Getty graves
My OG was Eddie Hayes so I knew how to craft a spell
Crack, undoing our plastic shell
When your wife goes down her asshole swells
Football players as versatile apes
Blow birthday candles on a urinal cake
I don't want to hear your personal take, the elders know
A branch of motor neurons being plucked like a six-string
So your lips pucker to kiss a ring
Don't miss a thing cause

I'm from the golden age of name-calling
So your little POV ain't ballin'
Fuck them kids under London Bridge
Way off the grid

I was just a stick in the mud
Next to the hissing sub
While slipping in, not dripping blood
From niggas trippin' soliciting drugs
I'm out of place with my mind crazy
The bougie nigga with the white lady
Give a stern look to the bigoted judge
Fight the charges, get it nipped in the bud
Billed a burgess,
 deputize all code monkeys
So the vote machines can go hungry
Or being subject to the close study of a snow buddy
No money in your hood at all
Out your block, cat call
At your inner city dancehall
Niggas ripped for mythical sources interrupting elliptical orbits
Magic guiding centripetal forces
Cause a stir of biblical proportions
Tucker the tools to the end of your horse trips
Getting offers from corporate courtships
But you always fuck it up
Cause that artist-run label was our father table
Where we 
dethrone
 your Clark Gable
Organize verbally under that Leimert Park fable, damn

One, two
I'm from the golden age of name-calling
So your little POV ain't ballin'
Let's skip that wench on the Los Angeles audition bench
Let's do this shit until our teeth fall in
The world laughs in flowers
The world laughs in flowers
Grooves of my mind 'bout the size of a world
The world laughs

The world laughs
The world laughs

Fight the charges, get it nipped in the bud",https://genius.com/Busdriver-im-from-a-different-time-lyrics
​the saboteur’s mirror,electricity is on our side,2018.0,"We poisoned the paint
Filled in a noise complaint

I'm solving problems with music
I'm using my scepter that evolved from a pool stick
Cruise ship, I'm full of either Somalian pirates
Or jazz men practitioners yankin' out flag pens
You cannot solve your problems with music
I'm banned from the sausage fest when I colored in the water crest
Radicalized by a false arrest just like my world view’s an oxygen tank, caught in a  fence with them holes in it
How can you reference the world but never roll in it
Master P money from grown  with No Limits
Who go the distance into money making ventures
And show the resistance my photo is physics
Frozen in mid-flight new signs for the bit pipe
Become the mixmaster for the mixed martial arts of the shaman
Pediatrics for the queens of tomorrow
The lifestyle aces hosting dreams you can borrow

Like this is not a place you can chill
Is the face of a mountain the face of a bill
The saboteur's mirror
Streaming truth as you're chased down a hill
This is your heart in a bag
Where you cannot depart from the fad or your art in an ad
The saboteur's mirror
Does a soup with your arsenic tabs

Sneaking in 
Everywhere the games of the broke economy
Nobody can follow the thread of logic or the blockage
Of metabolic or weed trippin'
Is this a  regiftin'
Yo, the fuck
They must have mistaken that love for a human feeling
Blew the tuba through the roof and the ceiling like

They don't know about that
They don't know

They find the character of your heart
Adequate for a black nationalist upstart
Pluck apart that woven fear
You're super  in the lower tear
Where you can read all your emotions clear
Now you know you a  rack up that karmic debt  you over grip
Don't stop to behold the myth
Fuck an artist's rep

Happy birthday to me
Sometimes you just can't fall in place
You can't
Watcha gonna do with that beat

Can I fall into place
You cannot fall into place
You cannot fall into place

You can solve any of your problems with music
Self right on they dime
Hip hoppers climb to the top of the pinnacle of the pop charts
Distinctive kinds of black art have put the black artists on the meat mart
The industry hack whose teeth are sharp
Everybody needs to meet this side of the park
I try to reconvene, you see what I mean
That seems to be the best point of emphasis
You know we be eating with the photosynthesis
And I wonder whether homies would hold up on the written test
You know that's why I be spittin' fresh
I should have had you rappers on a grill like a chicken breast
Bad rep, really, snap necks on my aspects really
'Cause y'all ain't down with the Aztecs really
My vernacular says African Mexican
While the fashion of the denizen
Stays masculine and feminine
I'm a missing in action veteran (What?)
While your hood is a maximum bedlam 
Turned it out it was an act of God, but yeah which one
Yes, you, why you act so odd
You kick up with the homies that kiss guns
 touching that playful stubble
Angel dust on that cake crumble
So you board the space shuttle
'Cause they don't know that you make trouble

 lattes
It's all dreams
And I'm in love with a talking hot air balloon
She gets drunk at the hair saloon
She has the biggest breasts and the shortest ad space
And there's a nigga dressed all in blackface
And that's why I'll be carjacked by a Korean volleyball team
 that's why my body all green
 to cross my mind my body's green grass
And my eyes are now a gaping wound
And they want to clean my gash
'Cos I'm being extremely rash
While chasing the moon
 thinker's wisdom
My body's implanted with a sprinkler system
And if that wasn't a drawback
They told me to fill out this draw back
Just in case it rains dogs and cats

When you cross my mind you best look both ways
'Cos my personality's bigger than yours

When you cross my mind you're best to look both ways
Walk the streets in an insulated space suit
Innovative breaks and loops
Give the bass their escape routes
If they're not intimidated and break loose
And the stimulants are grapefruits
You see daddy cares what we form in all the wreckage
What anti-glare now I know how awful that 
This is my thoughtful message written in scribble
Only to be transcribed by the last man alive
Who lives in LA and was just having sex with an insecure dancer
Until he has testicular cancer and dies
But me, I sit on my lawn chair
Waiting for my tax return
Swinging my long hair, riding on a pachyderm
In an  store
'Til we hit aisle two  
In LA I'm dead, a cold snap that won't pick up on the heat sensor
I'm like your own dad
With false teeth and dentures
Selling biodegradable lawn to inflatable dolls
This is where the beat drops
And you put your hands in the air
Don't just stand there like  bewildered panda bears
Show some enthusiasm
Hopefully when the show's done I'll leave with a moody  who has a booty you can't fathom
 and too scoops so wash it down with fruit juice

​me vs. me,electricity is on our side,2018.0,"Black man is a colloquial term
I’m in that voting booth soaked in the Oreo germ, I’m
Called to renounce my poetry publically
From the stapled stomach of an unfaithful lummox
Now I rap for bankers, that’s why I’m exacting bangers
My new flaccid wang is always casting flavor
Is always dipped in frosting
I died prematurely before I got to equip my offspring
Beware of the swamp thing
Look at my eyes and really know that there are no answers
So go ahead and mix that coca with the Arm & Hammer
The knowledge of self was all it took to arm the Panthers
They gave the same thing to me and I got a charming stammer
That’s them dark thoughts shooting through the enamel
Tuning the piano, looking at you like “What meds?”
When parts of who you are often butt heads
You can’t build a cut thread without bloodshed
You can’t relate to your child cause your mind is adrift
How many times could you hide your lies in a gift?
You know cowardice, you feel the power shift
As your mind shatters your ego to a thousand bits

Ah
Yeah
Ah
Yeah
Hear me out
One time
It’s like this
Ah

No empirical data just a theoretical merger
Between the giants of science and financial mechanisms

For a power-hungry junky who was born on the base
Getting sworn into office to stand up to the scorn of our caucus
And distort the importance of a race

Under trees that grow leaves of absence (I left your ass alone)
While nursing hearts like leaking gaskets

This freedom it tastes funny
I am a case study
Dealing with utilitarian uses of love

Because I'm stretching my seed banks
Dipping my toe in the sleaziest cesspools above

My stage persona can be nude

Makes you feel like you're in Junior High
My impulses go unsupervised - Yeah
I prowl on foot and spin a yarn
When the crowd looks like wind farms
My defense mechanism's been disarmed
Yeah - This freedom it tastes funny

Opposable Thumbs,Temporary Forever,2002.0,"I proliferate a plethora of pro black factoids
To the white piccaninnies who love black boys
I go to every poetry reading
Wearing my dashiki and kufi
And when all the OG's are leaving
Then I scoop my weekly booty
From women who are subdued by the
Left-wing liberal gibble-gabble for the minimalist coffee shop leading frivolous civil battles
My body's offered to a higher cause
To sample my goodies with firing squad
Shooting with earth tones and pastel colors
Enabling' me to start acquiring broads
I say cosmetics are extract from whale blubber
I'm saying tennis shoes are made from 4 year-olds in sweat shops
I'm saying kill whitey and death to the cyber god!!
Before you know it shes wearing moccasins and grass skirts
See how fast it works
You'll be eating narcissists and bags of multi-grain bread
Reading books and saying TV land is for the brain dead
It is simply because of her bourgeois upbringing
There's her in my bohemian flat vintage clothes hanging off her lanky physique
Romanticize this angry geek
She's college material turned into a fair-skin whore American forged
I've been seducing these women so I formed a committee and I'm the chairman of the board
Call me Harrison Ford when I have to use my ""Han Solo""
Guess what? happiness, has a sales tax
We're not soul mates, that's just something that I read
I don't love you, I am just a movie actor
Lets read poems in a nuclear reactor
You may think I'm just a anti-social bum
Well I don't need you, cause I have opposable thumbs
Wanna hear my dissertation?
Exchange your tutu and tiara for this hemp anklet
Have you ever fucked with a martyr then slept in the embankment?
(??)n*sync and I wrapped into a handkerchief
I decorate my speech with Taoism and karma
But I don't know Walt Whitman from Walt Disney
Small titties and perky nipples will augment my dog sense
But I'm far from a puppy dog
Cause I have opposable thumbs I'm just a sturdy fraud
I use to study abroad
(??) undercover sex symbol Ehh?
Rap moguls make sums from money fraud
But I sell CD's that sponge off young ladies and will
I was fighting for all of my rights when I stood still
Like a beattress to the KFC
When they sold chunks of the mutated red rooster
Genetically engineered, dude it's good
And other girls sell the corporate Lex Luthor
Exponentially by the end of the year
(?? the low income homes ??) out of toilet seats, we'll come to my place and read ya tarot cards
We'll exchange bodily fluids and I'll exaggerate all of my political views, the colorful whimsical hues

I don't always need women, cause I'm happy with myself
Nanananana you will leave me
Nanananana but my poems suck
Nanananana you bought my CD
Nanananana now your modem's stuck
All the ladies in the house, who sleep with poets
Just put your hands in the air, just let everybody know who you are
(know what I'm saying) hey, young lady? very good!
All I have is salty game and a membership to blockbuster
Trying to make subtle advances until she called me a cocksucker and told me to not touch her
Can't two consenting adults be open about their sexuality over hot supper
Trying to nibble on the woman flower but I get swooped down upon by the ex-boyfriend crop duster
How can I sample her goods?
Must be a tree hugger who sleeps in a tent to re-number the sequence of events
Or fucking patron saint of self-pity whose ego lives in a little world
And has blatant hate for elf-city?
Probably
She'll think I commute from Mars to Earth
To pick a working princess in a poetry onto my star-search
Even I'm of large gurth and have boils on my skin and I'm a hunchback
She'll simply involve by my supposed artwork
Even though my poems sound like im the first mothafucka to hear Ursula Rucker
And I'm so Hollywood
I wanna be on speaking terms with all the superstars
Eating wheat germs and fruit bars
(going through some firms?) and roll up my used car
Like poetry for polygamy yeah
Poetry for polygamy yeah

And you came with refined goods and a saddlebag
Everybody's been on gridlock

Bleaching sheets with an X and O
While we breathe deep while flexible

Decrease your decibel

Going ""Hee hee"" at your present goals
You eat your crescent rolls
With cheese wiz in your flesh folds
Seek deep in your section codes
Because you didn't do well in the exit polls
Not me, nigga, boy's straight
I can land hoes like ""Ahoy Mate!""
But I feel that after the noise game
Free Spink rethink Tolstoy's take
Hot topic at the water cooler
Rich niggas, they're on to the movers
Like entrepreneurs
Store fronts gettin' foreclosed and poured O's in Morse code
Turned the whole Southland to an Art exhibit
Making murals from a thousand outstanding parking tickets

Through the 90's I stepped in poo-poo
I think the Headsman stepped in Fubu
Girls wanna let me inspect their juice boobs
My niggas call me Desmond Tu-Tu

Reborn in an online forum
Pull me out of the egg yolk
I am a synthetic life form
So I'm gonna go rob a stage coach
Or the dude with the hip
With my stick
Go naked under a rain coat
Gold in the cusp, it's social injustice
As my advocate scapegoat
I really wanna go hard in the paint
Better go dishearten
And the painting red hardens
Since I was eighteen
Eating peanut butter sandwiches
And the baked beans
On my lunch break

And she's heating up on that spoon again
Soothe dark, the perfect gold earrings
For snapping jaws at a parole hearing

With my good taste cause I don't have any
I'll buy a high with that black penny
In Baton Rouge with the dealed-up plates

And go a bit insane as you light the roach

God damn, black and milds nearly took my life

Fear alike, catch your foes like a deer in light

Now I know why the caged parrot carry on

Every day, grape soda and cereal

Huh, I'll have blood oozing out the doll in paint
Leave the club fuming and you'll file a complaint
When the next emcees of human style is a faint weapon
For me to hinder the growth
Is my civil duty
I'd rather you find your inner beauty than wiggle your booty
'Cuz there's mercenaries in all the blind spots
That could get my person buried in a pine box
Is it because my first person carries on all the time slots
Or 'cuz I won't treat a Virgin Mary like livestock?
I want a B-girl who praises Islam or Rastafari
Doesn't hang out with misogynist bar flies
Not an androgynous tomboy, or a lecturous lush
With an affectionate bust, who has a fetish to fuck
She'll give you genital warts full of infected pus
What'd you expect from Bus?
Of course I'm a party pooper
Your girl brings me Kama Sutra while I'm squeezing barley from her juicer

I'm a party pooper, but you just want to squeeze on barbies' hooters

Fuck wit dem hoes, be on some hot shit""

A warm stool from the butt horn of a mule
Or a globe that conforms to the rules?
So I take these fools to reform school
Or go ahead and buy a new pair of pants, we'll do the square dance
You folks aren't given a fair chance to give the underground a glare or glance
But I'm certain that a rare chance will earn us shares and grants
Like I'm certain that you're handicapped and can't hacky sack
Like I'm certain that your crappy raps won't get no handclaps
I'm sure!
Like a breakout of anthrax
Make you take out your tampax, stand back!
That's the way that the biters go
The more decimals on the check, the more special effects
But it's an inevitable letdown
Leave styles to make you feel like a vegetable from the neck down
These drum kicks, sound like several tech rounds being fired
Shooting in the canopy to stop the hootenanny
""Okay people, exit the club, there's nothing to see here""
See, they bite chunks of info when cypher punks go home driving drunk
For god's sake, snap out of it!

Your pop song's a satire of itself
Your war machine backfires and melts

At the anti-war group hug
Putting computer bugs in the infrastructure of the World Bank
With white guilt, accepting big-lipped puckers
From any two-bit Chris Tuckers
They yelled out ""cave bitch""
And I'm an extra in The Matrix
With my hand on Carrie-Anne Moss' tits
Acting very standoffish
They salute a married man's soft prick
I'm the color of an eggplant
But I send my mulatto babies to spacecamp
They yelled out ""underground""
Without me heads have seizures like they're hypoglycemic
You put me in the player and my Sky Pro's denied
It won't read the disc
And even if you'd cared
You'd be like ""fuck your lyrics""
I'm a hedonist who sleeps with Liz Phair
They yelled out ""towelhead""
A middle American said he ate a 
falafel
It tasted awful and now his bowels bled
And soon Muslims at a mosque were found dead
On a burning wooden cross
They yelled out ""dirty hippie""
Looking like a Martian landing party
And cut our college grant because they suspect we plan anarchy
We'll deprogram you
You Al Qaeda sympathizer
And carve a tree with a Trans Am car key
To build a Mantan's marquee
They yelled ""slut""
At 
my post-coital o-face
And lecherous sweat musk that I showcased
But it was heartfelt when I undid her garter belt
But I watched the love that I harbored melt
They yelled out ""bum""
At the frosted tips of my mullet ducktail
Walking in the upscale bar and grill
Where fools tuck tails behind large bills
And I'm a cynic during wartime
In an unattractive thrift store find
I yelled out ""fascist""
At the robotic orphan makers
Running for office in the form of Schwarzeneggers
They will digitally alter your torture chamber
To look just like a bath and spa
Without sanction of international law
My coarse hair means I'm into petty theft, right?
There's an imbalance of Lord's Prayers to lefty's laments, right?
But you can't offend me or Of Mexican Descent, right
We've heard a thousand ""fuck you's""
Love is not enough
So why defrost that frozen kiss?
Your happy skies are cotton puffs
Your modest lover's focus shifts
Love is not enough
So why defrost that frozen kiss
You toast apathy bottoms up
And take your reality load it to disc
Why do you hate me?
Is it my numerous releases on Ninja Tune?
Or my on going fling with Reese Whitherspoon?
Or is it because I'm the indecent Mr. Coon
Who occasionally takes trips to the moon?
I know it's because I made my hip-hop cookies
And didn't let you lick the spoon
Or because we make girls throw fits and swoon
And I'll reduce your club to talcum dust too
And accompany your thousand ""fuck you's""

Sucked up in the union turn my dues in with the monthly pledge
Breaking the Rosetta Stone, shouting on the megaphone

And I'm the battery-powered deflowered nimbus

Stepping over fly-by-nights

Favors neo-Nazism in the house pet chorus
Throw the medicine ball, divvy up the windfall
Fit the trophy wife for the wet corset
I go from a hug to an open-handed cartwheel
That's how I vivisect the dinner guest at the arms deal
Breathing with a suck slurp, I scrutinize the bloodwork
Of the green thinkers and no cars yield
Pointing out all the freckles on the darkroom negs
To carbon date a marketplace full of bootlegs
Bottle zygote nog, for all the roadhogs
Matching in, white, blue, red
You cannot triangulate the angles of this paragon
You are not a G at all, you work at a hair salon
When you raise the hot comb, I will move to Stockholm
Till the soil to put a parish on
When I do away with questionable motherfuckers
I can outsource sorcery
They wanted a Moulin Rouge and some bullion cubes
But we jettisoned all that by the megaton
Now they've got their Oolong brews and their MoveOn dot orgs
(Hey, go!) x3
So I'm turning on the waterworks
Cutting through the modern murk
Knee-deep in a pot of dirt
To render handfuls of sky
Turning on the water works
Shunned where founding fathers lurk
Knee-deep in a pot of dirt
To render handfuls of sky
Cowering in firefights
Stepping over fly-by-nights
Contrary to prior plights
I render handfuls of sky",https://genius.com/Busdriver-handfuls-of-sky-lyrics

Copious quips, followed by an intervention
Makes me feel I'm lonely as shit
His phobia's just  how money is ripped between his friends and fam and now he's throwing a fit
But you're an addict too, your breakfast is a half a keg of Coors Lite
And that fool's a chronic masturbator
With a cache full of porn sites
And a fat J in your ash trays, they support right
I'm being forthright, 'cause back in the day
I was in cabarets with whole scores of whores, tight back pain
But all of my most despicable traits are embedded deep inside of my hemoglobin
Just because you're a twelve stepper in a felt sweater don't make you no theologian
For you any medicine denizen will make a suitable dad
As long as they provide mescaline chewable tabs
And jettison the redder skin around those immutable scabs

I bet with all the richest kings you'll try'n get all the dishes clean
Without a spliff seam or a nip of lean or dimethyltryptamine
But we're all meant to kiss the ring, for example
I'm addicted to my political recourse
I'm gonna spit it at the lawyer's face in city hall
And my disc jockey hate Mitt Romney at his boiler plate vitriol
But I never get as high as you, you leave footprints on the moon surface
Call your needle up like it's room service

I saved your ass with hip-hop (Maybe)

The pet peeves of the candidates
And wet reeds in their tan lips
Exceeds the bandwidth
The self-empowered blogsters, and all you apathetic scenesters
From this downward-dogger
Newly flowered songbird

Through rap fads like an occupied Baghdad
Looking like a pet monkey

Choking on a tapioca ball
In being a sun-drenched life-size Yoda doll

Admonished, I withstand the office day singed
Then become counter-culture's misanthropic statesman
Take wives with a chest full of animal hair
Put their vulvas on pre-heat
Then have an extra-marital affair at the yoga retreat
I'm a wheatgrass fueled, rehashed, eco-friendly hippie freak
Encased in what's aesthetically pleasing
Marvel at this LA-based, dead artifice

What's her name Holly

You can not suck on my lolli
I am not writing frivolity, nigga I'm issuing policy
They only play this in Martian colonies for the recluses and oddities
Who can chew bullets like poppy seeds
Along with the league of the chalky knees
Our relationships are putting major chips
In the paper clips of prohibited economies
But to be honest my nigga, no I can't afford no Versace
I shiver on trollies and go home to table full of glossies
But when I put on these shade you can not take them of me
Like I took Biggie's eye exam
Like I'm eating 50 fried clam
Versace Versace, vindicated vaginas on vivacious Vivians
Moriarty's magna cum laude bumping loudly as rowdy amphibians
The talking points are spoken loudy, the oilmen are Saudi
And nigga, that's really in
But with me, when it's love or money
You can always bet that the titties win
Versace Versace, I'm sipping on lasse, my time is so costly
Cuz my wage is a pittance my days are sentence
And I am no Chachi
I harbor a pathogen that there hasn't been antibodies
For, I'm an author
Writing batty copy
Whores, engorged
Riding candy bodies
Tour the shores
From Miami to Mugabe
Hoards roar...

Dancing fancy-free to Fugazi

Black coffins filled with black prophets
The history a cycle many of us just caught in
Just a spark, keep it movin' like the stock car

Eating brunch from a TV's cunt
Now I throw jabs with a clutched blade and download no upgrades
Cause my niggas' lives homogenized to drug trade
You ain't cage-free, stop actin' like they waved the fee
Like drugs were the change that you were made to be
Niggas bleeding on the soggy paper plates meant they acryllic for
My idyllic rage face
The enslaved race from the 1800's are tasting Trump sticks
While they're administrating thumb pricks
Blac bloc, shamanous air
I spray the attack dog with phosphorous flares
But do I know how to kill anymore?
Should I defrost crosshairs?
And aim right at the ten stars then nights of the templar then turn up
Act like we revised the benchmarks, but we didn't reach limits
Wanna call your ego-baiting altruistic, alter Twit-pics of
Selfies to musicians, and bump piglets to redundant visits
And add salt, lemons, to look up at these real niggas when they walk the stage, but they'd
Shun them and they done them
And when the song's ending so

Even on batshit and at risk and I can only see red

Enough to put that lightning in a mood swing

Your mother under a slender blade
Underfunded Medicaid
Die alone in a rented cage
Slamming those dominoes on the dinner table
Waving a gun barrel sticking out of the farms in the Winnebagos

Superfly on the future high

Backhand it with a tennis racket
For preppy kids master them on expensive rackets

Throw a party on the Hubble then Bacardi for a couple
If you got the most so nobody can bust your economic bubble
 under the rubble because you couldn't figure the puzzle
Yeah, I'm in a shuffle
Back in the day I would handle the duffel
Now I be digging my grave with a shovel
'Cause I'm in a job that's not on my level
Not on my level, get on my level

And I... and I was so pissed off I stabbed it with my shoehorn

It not impeding the Malaria

I should be on suicide watch

Make it rain like a paper route

And the labors all for the races

And end with bald tires
Reprehensibly

Rubber glue

Fuck you to

Fools refer to rap like it can be succinctly summed
With their tubes tide they choose sides
And then the feces’s flung
Thanks to it, man I’m a stinking bum
Drinking white coffee who biopsied
The bleeding gums of my teething young
Shout out to my girl
With my pinky and thumb I make her pee-pee cum
Shameful pillow talk makes her dildo squawk
So I chill in my Long Johns cozy, eating Wontons slowly
My haircut straight Jon Bon Jovi
As a kid I kissed posters
Now indie kids get big boners when I kick the misnomers
Being the only black guy in the room’s a given
Discussing it ad nauseum makes my body numb with rheumatism
Y’all be on rap, man I’m beyond rap
I just yawn at rap so turtle wax my ball sack
Hematoma at Tony Roma’s for us OG Yodas
For sitting on cozy sofas drinking soapy boba
Man I can make Parker Posey’s ovum ingest Macaulay Culkin
Then turn Sarkosy Vulcan
Because I’m that ill, man I kill to breathe
I’m so ill that I’m more than often ill-received

For my boyz n the hood diorama
Oh my band sucks shit
Were not first on no bills
We play sand buckets
And eat birth control pills
And my fingertips look like crisp fried ends
I go off
Diss my friends
Looking at the negative balance on my account through a fish eyed lens
You get some tap shoes and snorkles and bandmates
And sheet music with trombones and handguns
And what do you got
Unsafe sextet
We upstage the best yet and tongue bathe cassette decks
Holding unpaid rent checks
You get some piccalos and cutlery and thermoses
And fashionistas with jumpsuits and congos
And what do you got
Unsafe sextet
Gilded hearts of booklovers
And you decided to write the hip hop version of karma sutra
After being fired from your job for uprocking to close the water cooler
And you decided to write the hip hop version of karma sutra
After being fired from your job for uprocking to close the water cooler
In the regalia of a star prick I measure our genitalia with a yardstick
And dethrone my third person drowning it in sea foam
And drink the blood from its wing nub dipping in it with cheese scone
Exchanging pelvic thrusts while pulling the elephant tusk from my cheekbone
Put my dirty feet in a pair of socks and my bird beak in a swear box
And unfasten my pants
Insure that my mojo crash lands on your happenstance
Youre a flash in the pan
Quid pro quo with the newest thing to come out
With me its no go im a shooting range cut out
But my woodie's blair underwooden, you should book me with wonder women
I ain't go the suggested footwear but the kids leave the breakfast nook bare
When I prep fixins im hedging clipping their reading habits at the book fair
But im too pithy and far fetched to compete with your hickeyed guitar neck
I hear the political convictions of your depbut EP dwarf isclamfascism
Great news! you get rave reviews 5 out of 5
But this'll leave your noodle full blown this year were touring funeral homes
And that self serving agenda will buckle under the weight of these lengthy diatribes

Its so hot and fresh, your merch booth needs a sneeze guard
And I fall off without a tug on the ripchord
I amount to fuzz of the mixboard

Bone Structure,Perfect Hair,2014,"Let me tell ya
Kill your penis and worship mine
Cause the story can drown out a chorus line
So pull up a chair and pour the wine and I'll show you how I got here

I fell from a gash in the rain cloud
Into a bed of jazz minister Jasmine's brain child
Blow it like a gay Archbishop into game cartridges
In a city of plastic bottles reading graphic novels
 accommodating cheese toast bagels
All the white friends thought I was pre-post-racial
All the black friends dressed like heavy D calculating trendy jeans customizing their own STDs
My part seems genetically engineered
With war correspondents and orthopedic kedy gear
And flannel shirts when the cancer's purse sheds a tear
So I fill them with white chest with lead Adidas
My mom was a dancer, dad was a screenwriter
During the interim ceasefire, my name never hit the police wire
Cause my dad's favored by a Gucci shop
But my mom was broken box across from the study-pox
From there went from straight A to straight flunk
My number one influence was a crystallized cocaine chunk
So I'm going through the motions like a lame duck
Sad cause my mom was hitting keys like Dâm-Funk
Damn

It's only two ways
I was alone and it was quite clear
I'd be on my own trying to fight this fear
I barely survive and so there's all this weird in my skeleton bones
I was alone and it was quite clear
I'd be on my own trying to fight this fear
I barely survive and so there's all this weird in my skeleton bones

Come on
Kill your penis and worship mine
Cause the story can drown out a chorus line
So fix your hair and snort your line
And I'll tell you how I got here

I got my sniveling inner child quarantined
Started snorkeling with Good Lifers at age 14
Chillin Villain taught me how to make a record happen
I spent every second rapping, now it's method acting
But I was up in court for the attack that made blood sport/spurt
So my teen years in L.A. were cut short
My uncle took me taught me about Porta Cheese and Paellla
Now I speak Portoguese
We stayed in the villa of his ex-lover
Then like next I'm up in the scuba bra
I can see my daughter in Paris
With the daughter of the famous Phil Parapador
I can't believe we're only behind the closet door

It's only two ways (Tell him Mike, yea)
I was alone and it was quite clear
I'd be on my own trying to fight this fear
I barely survive and so there's all this weird in my skeleton bones

I lost my job as a P.A
But I found out how much a dream weigh
By selling recordable discs to get by
I was shy with an adorable lisp but I
Put the wedding cake in the cash register
So my head space became a crab nebula
What's Pokemon?
Handworn sex toys are the stribers' woody
Is on by the hustle so I'm staying a cyberbully
He finds crowds that you can't inspire fully
Spam box, ham hocks, I'm a blowhard
Hip-hop, motherfucker, and it's full-form
I do shows for a smile and a hell no's
Making baby formula out of underground dough

It's only two ways (I did that shit, homie)
I was alone and it was quite clear
I'd be on my own trying to fight this fear
I barely survive and so there's all this weird in my skeleton bones
I was alone and it was quite clear
I'd be on my own trying to fight this fear
I barely survive and so there's all this weird in my skeleton bones

​tiny infinities,electricity is on our side,2018.0," allegiance, flat Jesus
Adam and Eve and barnacle breathing
Under partisan particle leaving
Case complacence, I'm stationed facing my maker
Mouth full of braces, crutches touching under my ankles
Barely a body, more just a screen with a hanger
Anger a hobby, chose rigid gaps for slaver
Task for labor, bastard cashing in where he tasers
Mask in the gutter with shea butter
I shake, shutter
Shiver in the river capsized
The glimmer that baptized
To simmer with tape decks
Old heads relate well
Peel the skin from the apple slow
Slice my mouth in cold
Knife breath rose deeper
There's no songs left, just a fever
Foggy blades I've eulogized
Grave digging the supersized mind of gluttonous puns
Dumb subtleties cumbersome
Bed wetters are troublesome
Past age six, I was already an old man with a death wish
Now a middle-aged escapist with no room to grow
Wombs like rubrics cove
Walked a maze in the garden rows
Take my face from the shelf
Talk to the lake and the elk
They say the same thing
""Where have you been all my life? My life, where have you been? My life, where have you been?""

I'm from the roaring twenties, you know we get the shit done
Now throw in a roll of twenties into a hot dog bun
In an outdoor park, so I can do without your remarks
When it comes to leftist yuppie squads I'm 
Groucho Marx
So come to Cali and get served, fool
At the rib joint you get served
While we pinpoint that pinched nerve
By chilling, puffing on a lit joint and big CERN
In an awkward spot, I'm tangling my guts in an oxford knot
Spazzing for a stomach full of water drops
Man, I'm so raw I can't get a show in my own city
Blow fiddy, so witty, control-alt-delete your whole city
The console's mini but the soul's nitty-gritty
Mississippi mockingbird landing on the turtles nest
While ethnic whites bicker over who runs the world best
Man, why you staring at my girl's chest, fool
Yeah, uh

You're cursing heavens from above
Who you hate and who you love
But you should keep them apart
Because you won't dare use your mind the way no one can
You won't propose the plan

Befriend The Friendless Friendster,Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"Let's make friends
And not refer to rap monikers and astronomers
And be fun-loving
I'll give you roses, about one dozen
Everyone one at this party is so dumb and aloof
But you pry open closed minds like a sunroof
And you're interplanetary
And they're hindered while you're candid and carefree
Your impression of that political figure was done with cynical vigor
And it was so fucking funny
You're a conduit of impromptu skits
If your karma's bad
You need to disrobe
That armor-clad xenophobe that resides in your innards
Before you die and wither
Your inner playground's full of cobwebs
But I'll help you reach that obtainable godhead
Through Tai Chi stretching
And improvised rapping
So what if the posh are wed to the idea
That we're bastardized and crossbred?
They can't hint the live acts' whim
Or synthesize the vaccine
(chorus)
They await the star's hardened prick
And his guitar pick made of arsenic
But my sardonic wit goes far beyond it
Let's forget the rock star ethos
And go to the underground celebrity roast
And make some friends
And forsake the trends
We'll throw rocks at tanks
Erase the programs
Leave the robots blank
And curb the spending habits
Through serendipity
Let's make friends
Is it all ages or 21 and over?
Because Miss Honey Bun is older than a pre-teen TV screen
I suggest let's run with the sun at our shoulders
I have money in my gun holster
And several drink tickets
But by the end of our interaction
You'll probably think I need to pay a shrink a visit
Because tonight I'll treat you like girl meat
Dressed in a sesame seed bun
Asking you and your homegirl if you're interested in a threesome
But I'm out of line
Because you're an under-sexed lady cop
But you rubbernecked when I came in the spot
I gave you enough respect or maybe not
You're the cashier at Wal-Mart kissing the traveling man
I'll give you a papsmear a la carte
In our 15-passenger van at my show
The ephemeral girlfriend with extra baby fat
Courted by the LA megalomaniac
And you're much more friendly than the rats I know

They await the star's hardened prick
And his guitar pick made of arsenic
But my sardonic wit goes far beyond it
Let's forget the rock star ethos
And go to the underground celebrity roast

We'll throw rocks at tanks
Erase the programs
Leave the robots blank
And curb the spending habits
Through serendipity
I tried to foster a newfound love that a kiss led to
Oh how I misread you
And I just tried to be the downest homie
But our friendship was short-lived you weren't supportive
And saw I had a speech impediment like Pork Pig
But to say we can't be friends is not so
We can go to a hip-hop show and join arms
In unison at the soy farm
(chorus)
They await the star's hardened prick
And his guitar pick made of arsenic
But my sardonic wit goes far beyond it

Occam's razor, awkward on them
Knock-knocking on Arkham's gate
Not knocking what's on your plate
Not stopping you, stuff your face
I just won't eat shit no more, gone, off with you, run, go play

Refusing to join forces with your indie-thug wunderkind
I rather embrace what your city slum undermines
And encourage the idiom of bump-and-grind
Sickly glum of unbuttoned minds
I prime my condemned shell to excrete
A lithium honey wine for you frowning fucks
When trend arbitrators present my tortured lore adorned
Gags are soaked in chloroform
You get the same if you're poor in form
With your flip full-tuck and triple-lutz into this icy brook
War is sworn on my forlorned psyche's suit

Opposite elephants on sea-saws
Android man-boy befriends the chic, mod tinker bell
Then runs away from home until my knees throb
Sneakers smell
'Til my every tirade activates Jihad sleeper-cells
'Til flag wavers say, 'please God we need your help'
Still I'm precarious and flat-footed
Like you're arrogant at a gun show
I holler at your Marilyn Monroe
With declarative mumbo-jumbo my narrative unfolds
To a housed narcissism
Parented by a bum hole
I cling to pointless ventures
And inveigh buoyant pest verve
I suck

And niggas gangbang on Sesame Street

Represent for them clever gents
Who throw lemons under their trash heap
When they up the rep of those of a Mexican descent
And you form a critique

Note Boom,Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"Hey, hey, hey!..

I was in a Hip Hop hair band
When I was watching Yo! MTV Raps
Then I went to the CV shack
And I burned my unpublished books
And invented my young rugged looks
Through an investment of only a CD rack
When I became a star, now girls show me their bikini wax
And shower me in vaginal secretions
For no rational reasons
Whatever happened to the undying purist's fuel to buy the wishful rant?
The rap quiz bowl champ
Now I get invited to afterparties where girls have good snatch and nipple clamps (Yeah right!)
I'm supposed to be protesting at a missile plant
I'm supposed to be casting an unpopular vote
Instead of basking in a sauna in water soaked swim trunks
There's a skin chunk on my salad fork
There's an inconsistancy in my valid retort
You can dig in an underground T-shirt bin
But you're just on the outside looking in
So I poured formaldehyde under your cooking skin
Because I'm from L.A.,
Which means I'm a style snob
I can't imagine the validity of any rapper who can put me out of a job
Cuz while they were reading Calvin and Hobbes
We found polyrhythms in their basic loop
But I'm not from your favorite group
Put up your cypher circle's sacred hoop
I'm a hoola-hooper, bazooka shooter, new recruiter of a daisy-dukes-wearing lone groupie
I'll ???? ask you to play a bit part in my home movie
Because I'm a scene slut
You facetious fucks, if y'all don't make some noise I'll be applying for employment at Pizza Hut
Let's be level-headed, you can probably see through me
I'm the white man's character's nigga friend in the ethnocentric teen movie
Well shut the health nut's mouth, just pay him for the green smoothie

Hold on- I'm still important
I was the clumsy co-author of your celebrated mantra
For your movement, then my felt pen turned into a coke spoon
And I want my love back
So I await a note boom
Want to see my live performance? No!
How about I bump us a verse? No!
What if I made a television appearance? No!
Want to hear some exclusive tracks? No!
Damn, tough crowd
I thought they would always touch clouds when I bust styles, but what now?

What kind of name is Busdriver?
Is it just a wack allegory?
And it can't be justified by any background story?
I heard he sucks live, only appeals to hipsters who
Dress like Russian spies, Who are painfully cool and have button-eyes
A fan will squeeze a pint of fresh juice, and it'll discompose a recluse
But no childhood sex abuse can explain my terrible habits
That is why ""Single"" is my marital status
And it's why I'll happily take cash advances from charitable half-wits
And being that I'm from the Project Blowed I'm constantly probed
By the weak and the dull
With poor and boring things asked, I'll put a breech in the hole
Of their exploratory space craft with oratory weight mass, bleach their skulls
Because in recent polls, a black rapper's viewed as a voyeuristic dunce
Who doesn't care about the B-Boyer's intrinsic hunch
And now indie music is instant lunch, at industry parties I piss in the punch
And won't take a business card, I have a disregard for life
I'm not on a mission to Mars to leave satellite-dish shards in the night

Hold on- I'm still important
I was the clumsy co-author of your celebrated mantra
For your movement, then my felt pen turned into a coke spoon
And I want my love back

First off, do you have 
a fear of a black tangent

Were you born in the year of the rat
Do you cheer and clap when weird rap bands commence?

And that you want your tofu patty cooked, not grilled

Then do a Google search
And be discouraged when they find out
That the truth will hurt

Weighs about a metric ton
And makes her really self conscious

The funeral car is packed
But I have general admission
It's a pit full of thin air

But I can't afford the medicare
So I die in your arms

Hair dye (yeah)

She had
A single cell ego
In the form
Of her decomposed libido
Which was like that of
A single (?del gringo?)
The door to her heart
Has a big enough key hole
During screwing
She would need to get her hair pulled
She'd snarl and growl
As if she was a werewolf
Oh I used to
Be (?)
She'd even let me hit
On the hood of her car
She could lure
Any men into a (?zoom?)
And make them think there's a water fountain
In the middle of a sand dune
To get her you forget everything
Even if you were the last Christian
She'd usually fuck with
Mated with the state of masochism
Beautiful siren
You would have to find the bridesmaid
'cause we have
A different family that I've made
From a hole of a different protoplasm
All these women
Have multiple orgasms on their back bone
I'm a Pegasus horseback rider verse
A product endorsed black spider my whore
Moon stay course and trap driver she'll have
Me for main course and appetizer when
I propose they don't want me back
That's why I befriend hoes and scrawny rats
Don't touch me I'm a hypochondriac
Um, could you pick up my dry clothes from the laundromat
I don't drive over in my Pontiac so you'll burn body fat
Trying to catch me
My love for her was a neurosurgeon cut up a brains frontal lobe and turning my sensibilities
Into (?) a disgruntled toad only one of us (?calm enough to hold?)
And in my humble abode a women says she'll put it up (?)
She expected me to wait on her one hand and foot
And would it take into account all the monumental input
So I thought did I want to be in love
Or did I want to invent
With one I'd have an expressional outlet
With the other I'm just a sexual house pet",https://genius.com/Busdriver-single-cell-ego-lyrics

Ethereal Driftwood,RoadKillOvercoat,2007.0,"Y'all want to see tits and ass
Street grit and sass
As beatniks smoking grass on holiday
You're looking for a grievance to mask, preferably with a fetus in the trash
While you eat quiche and laugh on the Champs-Elysee
I'm not down with that B-list staff
As they yell out Jesus at mass
I'll be laughing while I knead this mish-mash of pottery clay
An appropriated grease-slick slab, posted up as a meat stick add
But I make the average moviegoer too seasick and sad
And I'm too caustic to run for office or be expunged
For my agnostic plunge
So what I've accomplish and done, is viewed as an off-setted pun
By the posh and young tastemakers
An overdone tame premise
I jump from the plane wreckage
Unscathed yet sunbathed in the rigors of 
a bass pluck
Pop culture's lame vestiges, 
I'm an ordained pessimist
With hippie-qualms and
Sticky bombs to deter the tank-truck
I'm good for a belly laugh
Covered in a blanket of ash
Leaving with an ankle cast
But sometimes I feel that…

I don't have what you want
So won't you accept my humble offerings
Broken TV sets as ethereal driftwood
When you're on the plane alive with water wings
You'll think,'I didn't know surrendering felt this good'
I don't have what you want
So won't you accept my humble offerings

They want semantics and sniveling
Grams to sniff on a triple-beam
To be hand-picked for a little scene
In a student film
All I have is pamphlets full of liberal zing
Antihistamines in a syringe-sling
A shanty for this fitted king
Of uprooted elm
And they've been given solar-powered cars
Trail mix and power bars
Upturned tarot cards
They want to be heralded by wishful teens
In stretch-Hummers and limousines
They're beyond medicinal means
But I gave them a protagonist
The color of cinnamon and mahogany
Filtered through award-winning cinematography
And the motherfucking discography of a G
If you don't like it then kick rocks
I'm pre-history's disc-jock
Yeah, I know what you wanted homie
But I never had the shit in-stock

I don't have what you want
So won't you accept my humble offerings
Broken TV sets as ethereal driftwood

I’ve not learned to die yet
But touch my sandwich, there’s fly larva droppings on the toppings
I have a pie chart of the pop teens
Hot springs success rate in the sex slate
So I’m chasing this ambulance
Holding the sky high heap of paper, that’s been signed
While answering my sci-fi beep and pager
Reminding me I’m in excruciating pain
But my face is a wide eyed screen saver
So why don’t I comply to cheap labor
And while it’s raining itemized receipts
But I hurt too and need some consultation
My name encrusted in hot donut glaze
And it’s close to an amount that equates to a new me
Yes I need a new me
‘cause the other new me said I’m a newly wed married to a warn head shot force fed slop
From a company, who are they?
I’ll sue them (sue you)
I’m suing Sony

Due to defamation of a character from a fictional character that was based on me
Caricature of me and a porcelain figurine that gave me poor skin and liver and spleen complications
I’m suing Sony

So much as disturb a single paint brush bristle
And I won’t just make your blood drizzle
I’ll arms race with a scud missile
I’ll drown you in the legalese of a lawsuit
Pause and mute you, why?
‘Cause I’m bored stiff
And to get me out of this couch you need a forklift
While I’m here I’m a world champ channel browser, rabble-rouser
With a 64 bit thing or something or other
You’ve awakened me from my comfortable coma
And I’ve run to record in Kev’s dirty laundry
Unearthly quandary, Leimert G, songs free
You lied, if you were a zen master
What would you have me procreate under leaking gases
If you work at lens crafters
How come I can’t see with these reading glasses
I’m gonna fucking sue you through and through

Reheated Pop!,Fear of a Black Tangent,2005.0,"Buy my posthumous full-length
My colorfully packaged disembodied shriek
Converted to ring tones used in car ads
Sung by winged gnomes over the head of Dick Clark
Cover pages graced by the chiseled hard abs
Of this now charred slab of dead pop diva
Recreated as the head of Biz Mark
Spliced on top of Hello Kitty
On a virtual land mass with a hip-kink
It’s lip-synched to my song and committed to telecine
And the nothing left of me is left to bask in a camera flash
I’ve never been so successful 'till I died
And my label wished my heavenly chariot
Pre-board defunct
I didn’t die in a hail of gunfire
I died doing extreme sports at a resort
On a bungee cord on a ski jump
No need to ask how a dead rapper can be a label's cash cow
They just record me months before on G-funk string chords
Add an R&B chorus
Hit a keyboard key to punch
Even though I'm dead
I was booked on a fortnight
To exhaust notes dressed like a cockroach
Now I'm cooked and ate with a fork and knife
As your reheated pop sensation
I'm framed under a caption reading ""prog-rap""
And given open-handed god smacks
By partisan zealots who not only think I draft-dodged Iraq
But that my back catalog is wack
And for it I should be flogged and smacked
But little do they know I'm dead already
And their complaints are small and petty
My autopsy was broadcast and shot on a webcam
I'm a dead man with golden blood in my bedpan
But still my pop song climbs
And you can buy it when you shop online
Prop my lifeless body up next to the podium as I accept applause
I'm an award-winning dead dude
With a tour pending and a celebrity love interest
I signed a movie deal to play a starring role
The film crew doesn't even suspect I'm dead
I'm your own martyr

Remedied by ""chop sui generis"" the seminal sleeper hit
From this tag-banger doppelganger
Turned a non-partisan anti-hero
And the sneaker fits
I'm undeniably left-leaning others got cold feet
It's because they're breast-feeding
On this golden teat (of an old elite)
This synthetic mammary gland
Of a pop-cult nurse aid in a birdcage
Which is actually an Iraqi oil drum
Mistaken as the divine mother by daddy's spoiled son
That's why you die in high numbers
For this populous Texan and his innocuous yes-men
You're a compliant spyhunter
Fresh dried-blood globules on dog tags
Are like scarlet opals
Exchanged for fossil fuels
So I charge rigged voting poles
Cuz the day's autumn hues lie
On a garbage boats on shoals
And an estranged god rules
Urging soccer mom's to want to carpet bomb
A peace rally on your campus quad
Watch as an Islamic phantom god
Is slain by a movie star
In a red, white and blue unitard
On a Fox news sister station
On cue insipid patrons soft-shoe

Forged from remnants of a former me
A hollow bulb that died of the common cold

What was my fleshy housing due to my
Wild fling with the art scene underbelly
I, a style king toiled over a volley of
Ideas and scrutinized today's news
But I've now been reduced to super-sized plates of food
And even this supposed headspace
That hemorrhages with a carbonated fizz
Is auctioned off for bargain rated bids
A sugary glaze is applied to every
Unfertilized seedling that my dementia approves
Every aroused spoof
Now childproof
Every emphatic 'no'
Now an ambivalent 'yes'
As you know they're arbitrarily assigned an Axis of Evil
But it can't be remedied by my on-campus free show
I would hyper-extend this Californian cactus needle
To snag rifle straps and also stab vinyl stacks
But it's used to inject botox in the cheeks of big-face bills
And I with chipped paint in my gills
Know that elected official and lobbyist have hid waste spills
And also misplaced kills
But in the face of that neo-con Nazi
I am no Noam Chomsky
I'm a nagging teen in baggy jeans
Who fixates on frills as bombs drop free
Yes we're embalmed zombies
Getting all shitfaced as interest-rates build on defense shares
But no homie, I'll die voicing my grievances
Give the bronze urn of this naysayer
To the modern-day Quaker

A bag of ruptured glands
Who lacks reasoning to understand
My self-directed hate fits

And adhere to these tacit skirmishes
All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched
We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes
This soft science leaves my body underwhelmed
Our ambitious union dissolves out of the color film
And I am just a crude outline
Obscured and pegged and numbered
Dangling off power lines
One of many discarded ex-lovers
Throwing pet food from the red carpet
At de-colorized coupling of heart-shapes
And all the panic-stricken flower maidens

Thank conservative fringe groups
They sling chimp poop up at the town hall meeting
But so what this is Groudhog evening
When I tend to the 86’d pupa against some gradient of fuchsia
When it slides to grayscale we just raise hell and threaten your safety with a loofah
I’m gonna die in this music pub
But first I’m gonna insist that this doofus budge
I don’t pop champagne I pop the mucus plug
My head marked with a bluish smudge
As I add to this key card collage
We don’t have no three-car garage
Just a perpetual lack of dopamine, I fall in the parenthetical black you go between
So I’m like ‘fuck your artist roster!’
To everyone of these target shoppers
I am well-respected, I am Jarvis Cocker
Give me my French duvet and crème brulee
Or I’ll ejaculate on grandma’s shoes and exacerbate the camera crew
With cartwheel yoga
I fart on teal sofas every time I botch the art deals in Dakota
I’m dead after this so raise the roof like a debt ceiling, I’m indebt to saline
My billing cycle feels like death dealing
At the funeral parlor my suit of armor’s homespun

Treated my twenties like I was in Logan’s Run
I turned thirty then awoke in chum
With strained tonsils one game console and broken thumbs
Good one Driver, hole in one

Won’t you take this step with me and never come back

I’m an opponent to companionship like I endangered the housecat

Because it’ll take a few millennia to pay off any future student loan
I’m a domineering dad in an abusive home
To keep warm I street perform with a sousaphone
Now I’m sipping on some arsenic tea
Bouncing babies on my arthritic knee
Crashing on the floor of a carpeted sea life don’t imitate art, nigga
Art mimics me
But this wasn’t my ideal plan
I should put a pine needle to my pineal gland
Rather than to hang high from a ceiling fan
Getting eulogy quotes from my real fans
I told my baby mama fuck off, nice move
My social graces on some vintage Ice Cube
My heart is a lunchbox filled with dry food
Titillated by the side boob I can’t tie shoes
Before I lay on the palette of the sea monster
Looking like BellBivDevoe eating peach cobbler
They know my pelvic bone sprouts Ewok fur
And my raps don’t sell vitamin water
I can’t buy the flyest flying saucer
I’m a high-flying sci-fi author
No you’re not, you’re barely a sexy mess
It’s my last show so it better be fresh
And of-the-moment like celebrity death
After it women run for a pregnancy test
And the biters get charged with identity theft
(laughs) Because Driver was tight
On his last go ’round he broke ground with every step
 (x3)
If I take this step I’ll sink in the black
Won’t you take this step with me and never come back

With one bill in a clenched fist
They told me I need to get rich or try dying
Try dying",https://genius.com/Busdriver-take-this-step-with-me-and-never-come-back-lyrics
Pompous Posies! Your Party’s No Fun,RoadKillOvercoat,2007.0,"This year I thought I'd do away with celebrity-endorsed barbarism
And to keep the people guessing get a bio-diesel engine
To cut my carbon emissions
Further my career by trading favors with aged ravers
You know, use the barter system
But I sat on my black ass sucking on sassafras
In my apartment bitching
Last year you were posing on the hood of a Lamborghini
In Gucci glasses and a tan bikini
Dating Meg White, eating tiramisu
I was rapping at a test site, banned from TV
And in therapy too
For pulling firearms out of Jell-O molds
With a sinister grin the color mellow gold
Running from the Southland PD

Pompous posies your party's no fun
Yeah whooptie-do
You can't offset the OG's cardio-sponge
Yeah whooptie-do
Though you've made millions off us
Yeah whooptie-do
This year we're getting off our butts
Yeah whooptie-do
Motherfucker
Whooptie-do
Motherfucker
Whooptie-do
This year I thought I'd cover you
With a thicket of wet unwarranted smooches
Rather than entertain sore feelings at board meetings
With these corporate mooches
Or being run over by un-sober law enforcement douches
It's sensible that I'm a randy-romper
A panty-dropper with these whorish pooches
Last year I was passing out Green Party leaflets
When you're at the chalet on ski-trips
Getting neo-cons all peeved and miffed
Heaving and choking on beef-bits
Cuz I ain't appeasing shit
Wearing tutus and a Bluetooth in a Subaru
Yeah you too
Can get your knees split, bitch

Last year they made buoys out of bloated bodies in the Big Easy
And nobody liked what the
Blowed embodied yet they bit freely
Rappers used recording booths
Like porti-potties being inexplicably cheesy
And I'm an out of work hobo
At the Mojave with a dripping squeegee
This year I'm going to make only one friend
This squatter girl at the opium den
Checking her viral load, wearing a bridal robe
Fresh off her codeine-drug bend
Cuz fuck them pop divas
They need pitch shifters and Brita pitchers
Full of mixed liquor, I'm a clit piercer
Of that bitch nigga who manages you",https://genius.com/Busdriver-pompous-posies-your-partys-no-fun-lyrics

Tell my baby mama
I'm Salvador Dali Dalai Lama Ali Baba
Styling on the wah-wah
Wilding with his blah-blah
Sliding skulls of trauma
To the verse  to the genius of this raga
See I was at the gahba
Tossing hot potatoes to the halos of OGs
Like a never ending saga
My niggeros from Figaro made me feel like Rwanda
But I was pretty spooked when the suits gave me 
Like I was in the Weathermen, Neverland branch
Never understood the clever man that never can dance
But rap made thirty mil, we ain't thirsty still
Tell my baby mom I'm gonna dead it as a mercy kill

Why do you do these things
Why do you do these things
Why do, why do you do these things
Why do you do these things
Why do you rush

Tell my baby mother
I think a lot to sink your shot at the buzzer
My hood's chief crop was rubber
While you sip hot tea
I'm at the top [

Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening
You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofers, clients butchered to a film score

When I'm racing in carpool lane
To sell shit to an art school lame

Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting
You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars

Hey, let me talk to these people
Ey, I got the 20-something rap guy anthem right here in my hands y'all check it out
It's for you young buck, or old buck, or middle-aged buck
Whatever
You got a face like an imperiled vagina
You're from a Carolina
Yet you spell your name with an umlaut and parentheses
You embody foot-in-mouth disease
So it's right that you write a book about MCs
It's like, cheers

Here's To Us
And all the nothing that we promised to do
Here's To Us

It's clear enough
We're near the cusp
Of a long-encompassing
Stroke of genius
I need you to leave
Peeves
We've had enough of your shit well should we help you?
Cuz I spit butane uh
Is it inhumane if I uh
Just get a few things
Yeah
I'm in stores with engorged grocery lists
I ain't buying I'm scratching off my homies' shit
A weeknight's a rewrite of Moby Dick
I sleep tight and dreaming hearing pre-flight safety tips
My room smells of steamed rice and baby shit
Cuz I'm consumed with what gets played through the cross fader
How ya mean I'm Lebron James of the Bronze Age
Renaissance nigga so I never learned to ball play
I missed a job in the views of movie sets
The vaporized weed with a jacuzzi jet
Cuz now I won't be the spokes man and for booty sweat
And break character for school I'm an anti-socialite
On karaoke night I request Deep Purple
It makes my sacra complete though it's a semi-circle
But the dance floor's a class war dress rehearsal
I won't stand for it
I'm sipping Merlot in the first row like, cheers
Chorus
Oh!
My personal unemployment rate is cringeworthy
And my party don't stop until about a six a thirty
In the morning I break it in the afternoons with my dick dirty
Knowing I'll be dead and famous before I hit thirty
But if I studied I could have been a neurosurgeon
Instead me and my band are busy circle jerking
Squeezing out a stroke of genius for rights to our intellectual properties are gonna need more subpoenas
They're like
You should make a mixtape
You should make a sextape
For all the hater and bottlers that slept late
I'll write a screenplay
Yeah, that'll be the day
The musings of Tina Fey become a personal BofA
Oops
When I say cheesy shit the CD skips
My MP3s are 10cc's of pretense
So sing my praises with your teeth clenched
On smart phones that speak French
My songs are going for three pence
Sucker!
But you said you killed over a song
Now you write tunes that you need a vocoder on
I'm trying to retire to Boca Raton
And escape the business end of the popo's baton
And like, cheers

Wood pulp But there's an uninterrupted tissue
Windows, outside, wormholes Between you and what cannot be
I'm an early-90's anachronism
Some kind of pan-African fitness gym
A lost class action petition
See I'm the reasoning behind your kid's slam dancing and ransacking the kitchen and den
And you're glad I happened in a distant then
Fast rapping pinned under a fish's fins
I excuse the shenanigans of your dissonant binge on the aesthetic of yesteryear
See cause I too thought it was cool how they would cower
Before Action Jackson's cinnamon skin
That was when the cost of an extra set of ears
Was a critical listen to my follow-up
And you allowed me to stock your pantry with my bottled muck
Staff at retail outlets cry on their sleeves
Radio programmers dry-heave
And you, the smart buyers, run at high speeds
Into a mile-high corporate sponsored silver screen
With a children's theme ad campaign
I've watch the tormented saunter through the madman's game room and said, ""go ahead""
Give your body to the iron cervix as spare parts
But there's a flying circus in your impaired heart
And yet you put a for-sale sign under your Stargate
And I did an amphibian advance simian dance on an Indian res because the city is dead
And no one wants to hear me retrace my ancestry from a transatlantic boat cruise
They want to hear my frantic energy diffuse through ProTools
Wormholes Out of natural law, dimension jumper
Wood pulp
Windows, outside, wormholes Dissolve castle walls and end numbers
Wormholes Draped with fuchsia, it's a faint future
Wood pulp
Windows, outside, wormholes It's a 90's throwback in a b-boy's suit on a tiny coat rack
And so I'm flushed down the wormhole
Like a dump chute with a b-boy's jump suit as church clothes
Speaking post-dated psychobabble that has yet to be cultivated
I'm a free-floating spermicidal tadpole
Or am I the meaning of your prior god
Re-enacted by actors reading dialogue
An unquantifiable sum
That's sold in a used rap section
A track selection deleted from your iPod
But I carefully cleaned your eyes with swabs
I was your seeing-eye dog
And you've never been loved before 'til I ruptured the core
Screaming that the sky's been robbed
Pre-warn the deformed body of work
With free-form choreography quirks
That the salesmen have date-raper pick up lines
And I have a wastepaper basket with fish guts and time constraints
I'm not contractually bound to make you happy and round",https://genius.com/Busdriver-wormholes-lyrics

The mass exodus to the next abyss
I pushed that sex bliss to the precipice
And now we share that bunk bed
But that goes unsaid
 machine read that raised me well
Most likely to go straight to hell
Straight from K to 12
Then unschool new new got that new baby smell
But you don't like how I respond to that safety bell
You greet us, I'm leaping out the brush
You said to keep it quiet but I can't keep it a hush
I'm blushed, read it out aloud the royal flush
My vanity plate now reads ""deez nuts""
But don't count the ring on my team's tree trunk
We pulled them all-nighters so you know me from my coffee breath
We can time travel with our body weight
You know I got the one fifty volts when you asked me for the  results

Uh, I'm the center of a dead moon
With a  on the wet spoon
We run through traffic and rush 
Philosophical debates with Archibald
Asking if the art is raw
 if there's no original styles
In your cynical trials
Then clearly, man, it's hard to call
And I ignore you just like  would
You're only here because the morning wood is like sporting goods
I cram the love yous into the sound cannon
Now my progress reports are all outstandin'
But you don't love me girl, 'cause I observe planets
Like one turns granite and learns Spanish

Their parents own oil rigs
They're just some spoiled kids who I must aim to please
And so I'm dipped in a syrup vat
And you know this town is a tourist trap
Run by entertainment industries and the bureaucrats
Selling the ultimate brain freeze
This year I'm Sambo
I'm on the Clear Channel
I'm smiling and reading my parchment of prose
I talk of the common man and of the promised land
But I'm insincere and make the Marxists doze
My head was a jar of lit bulbs
I used to make viewers carsick at shows
But now I'm easily the most compromising slut
Oh, it's hard to keep this harlot clothed
I network and do more than schmooze
I start licking toes
Underground rappers smell like garlic cloves
But me, I'm smug and decadent
Paid obscenely to appear at a set event
Companies license my likeliness
Money, it heightens my flighty fits
I wrote the great American pop song stylized to my respective tiny niche

I wasn't invited to your shindig
I've got no plus one and a low slush fund
I never expected to ever win big
I never expected for you to open my press kit

The attendance is always subpar when I perform at a club or bar
Why did I choose to do weird shit
I steered my career off a cliff in a flaming stunt car
So now I'm falling down a bottomless pit
But I'm trying to be optimistic
I spin microwaveable plates
But the label prorates nothing
My arms are to cotton pick with
Look at the poignant portraits in my doodle sketch
Meaning and art exude with every brush stroke
But my promises of revolution are futile threats
I'm so over sensitive my crotch is bloodsoaked
I'll African dance and cast a voodoo hex while in your dorm spilling all the bong water
And count the stars in the nebula until a 
googolplex
 while selling you sticks of nag champa
I dumbfound in the coffee shop
Looking like Jean-Michel Basquiat
And kill gaudy pop with dirty laundry smell
Acting all foolhardy
Leaving kids oddly distraught
Gentle laughter when I'm telling jokes at your dead pool party
I am a necromancer of an exquisite corpse
I'll cry ten minutes in your wet tennis court because I wasn't invited

I wasn't invited to your shindig

But everybody knows that is just a boobish misprint
On the brochure; Oh sure, such a hubris is fit
To procure your pure, yeah, prudish princess
Back when I put my reproductive glands in a plaster cast
Thinkin' that my Woody Woodpecker would always flabbergast
But my head trouser snake is more like a pamper asp
And I never had the candor to ask, ""Am I really all that?"" (Uh...)
Way before I ever got to pinch the folds
Of the hottest chicks, comic strips were like ninja scrolls
And my heart was an iridescent listless cove
Yeah, I'm echoing the rhetoric of pimpin' hoes
From the homies sipping on a Michelob
Yeah, fuck them niggas, they can all just lick my chode
Because I speak in amorous whispers that wisp her lobe
I said I speak in amorous whispers that wisp her lobe
But in order for a lady to ever admit my bulge
I need an entrance fee or an encryption code
Should I start cookin' crack on the kitchen stove?
Actin' like a superfly stupefied, wearing an Egyptian robe
Or just join a swing band, get a wingman
Maybe I can pull girls with the old pick-and-roll
I need a beauty queen from movie scenes to kiss this toad
Not my goofy schemes resulting in me getting a fist to the nose
Hey, I make that fishy face, that kissy face
When I'm throwin' ""what ifs"" at your puffed lips
Hey, I make that fishy face, that kissy face
When my sky's beneath your shoes
Don't go, no, die slowly, cuz we don't get along no more
And so I figured I could draft a piece of fiction
While you were waiting for food at the pizza kitchen
Just romanticize the idea of being grief-stricken
Yeah, all grumpy and bummy and all fleabitten
And now your sex drive is revved up within each piston
I found the perfect way for a nigga to meet chickens
I'm now the persnickety palindrome piecer
Her fidgety xylophone seeker
Suffering in a used car, FUBAR, with my teeth missin'
And now I bone a range of after-party harlots
Kickin' this old game like an Atari cartridge
Just from freelancing with a socialist tribune, I get poon
And give dick to who wants the goo gob
And diss Lou Dobbs and Brit Hume like
Smooches, kisses, smooches, kisses
Smooches, kisses, smooches, kisses
Smooches, kisses, smooches, kisses
Smooches, kisses, smooches, smooches
Hey, I make that fishy face, that kissy face
When I'm throwin' ""what ifs"" at your puffed lips
Hey, hey, hey, I make that fishy face, that kissy face
When my sky's beneath your shoes
Come on now, no one thinks that real niggas love rappin' nerdy
Or go to art exhibits and museums and view taxidermy
So go date a slew of tax attorneys
Who have logistically mapped their thirties
But I put them fools on padded gurneys
I hit it when your ass was fat and perky
But now you look like a Susan Sarandon doll
And I'm as volatile as a human cannon ball
I still rap like it's commentary for a horse race
With the political impetus of John Kerry's court case
For a vote recount--I got O.G. clout
I tell hoes, ""Peace out"" when they become bitter Strawberry Shortcakes
I move on, sleep on a futon arbitrarily in a storage space
From now on I solemnly make a pledge
To move her in just cause she's great in bed
And grate hearts up on a serrated edge
And break a year lease
While screamin' in your ear piece
Hey, I make that fishy face, that kissy face
When I'm throwin' ""what ifs"" at your puffed lips
Hey, I make that fishy face, that kissy face

Bottom Bitch (OG Version),Arguments with Dreams,2008,"...Guess what..?
Spoiler alert
I came here to titty twist saliva glands
So place your bets, save your breath and hissy fit firebrand
I can’t entertain these eery rock’n’roll staples
Like spendthrift, I spin discs on periodical tables
Take the basejump that makes you barf Wheathins
Your showreel’s bone meal under the stage lights
My everyday’s a coming-o-age cunt’s carpe diem
And this is why I treat LA like…
She my bottom bitch, cuz you my bottom bitch
Its safe to say what you think I’m saying’s a crock of shit
Because we fight a lot like this was Gaza Strip
But you my bottom bitch watch me make these chocolate chips
You my bottom bitch, why you my bottom bitch?
Oh!  Because you think I’m the source of all awesomeness
So be my bottom bitch come and be my bottom bitch
I look good in print so I keep the desk light always on
Here’s a glimpse into the sexlife of automatons
My every evening is an M night Shyamalan
Lackluster ending where I spend nights at Comiccon
I ain’t from here, I’m from some ragtag ferris wheel
I blew the horn ‘cuz you were born smack dab in squaresville
For a limited time you get to view the purple lotus
Plus I give soulseekers that Youtuberculosis
Y’all polish wood and just leave a sleek finish
But I’ll score Bollywood when my mood piece is finished
I don’t acknowledge hoods I eat good and speak Finish
With secret sects on Meet the Press yet please the left and tease cynics
Teen sex and free clinics is your town’s greatest resource
As if falling off’s a motherfucking team sport
So I entertain the young star baby gaga grudge match which tugs at
The lumbar ganglia, so I’m hunchbacked
You my bottom ..You my bottom ..
You my bottom botch, LA you my bottom bitch
To love me your heart most be bottomless
But to me you are precious, I’m on some Gollum shit
But you my bottom bitch from top to the bottom bitch
You my bottom bitch, yes you are
Them other niggas don’t hustle they just cotton pick
But me honey, I bathe in lava pits
You can not break the budgetary woes so your live band’s on a charter bus
Openers get poked with spurs screaming ‘I am Spartacus’
I put a fine comb to the flightplan of you starter-ups
They need rides home when I’m in Iceland in armored trucks
Rolling up to places on that VIP shit
Head’s swivel, I wet my whistle with these ice tea sips
You’ll offer me a loaf of bread a cot and a sofa bed
Cuz your scene’s dying in need of an IV drip
And I’m Chinese medicine, you guys need to headspin
When I press buttons
Yet nine times out of ten this LA tea party swabs balls
So I’m Lee Harvey Oswald with a call time
Fall in line youngin’ because I’m posted at the speedtrap
I’ve been here so long my nigga that I bleed tree sap

Cosmic Clevage,Cosmic Cleavage,2004.0,"My eyes may wander towards your cosmic cleavage
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you
It just means that I can't subdue my fudgehue's split second response time
When the underworld summons me and I become, what to do?
I told her I love her and she can put my heart in a box
But our quality time can overlap my selling CD's in a parking lot
My life's a gigantic nothing
Underneath the panic button
But you shouldn't feel that I never try to turn my doodlings into a house with a poodle swings
When I'm sick you're allowed to visit patients
So over my head you form a cloud of mal-precipitation
And my night depends on how loud the crowd participation is
So what if I want to rap forever
I can as well kiss goodbye this jacket-sweater
I think I should get a feverish band tattooed on my right wrist
I found out that love in L.A. is like being pricked with a manicured thorn
Innocent girls who looked like they used to star in amateur porn
One finical disaster
An exotic dancer is born
I really thought you're gonna fill out those UCS school transfer forms

Wowee look at that
The suicide princess enters the sky
Aw funny, funny how the cosmic robot baby
She's a beautiful clone she is
My eyes may wander towards your cosmic cleavage
But it doesn't mean that I don't love you (cause I love you)
It just means that I can't subdue my fudgehue's split second response time
When the underworld summons me and I become, what to do?",https://genius.com/Busdriver-cosmic-clevage-lyrics
Jeane Anthony,electricity is on our side,2018.0,"Yo
You know our love's eternal
Where was the first place you fell in love
And you would go and  place exists
Does the  have an  place
Electricity dancing on your fingertips
Like the sacred myth

The medicine man at the refugee camp
So negotiate your well-being with a plant
Spliff burning over the guitar amp
No love for the rewards and their grants
We don't need that stamp
The shaman reeks of the homemade moonshine
'Cause how we live, there's always a food line
But you're new to the grind
Melt down your belongings to them golden tokens
'Cause we've been ice skating on these frozen oceans
But let me ask you this
Have you been engrossed by a wish
Grabbing your lover by the wrist
Saying I insist
We are on the cusp of bliss
Let's just suck on the wisp
Look up from the abyss
Black people loaded with the gift
Greens on my salad fork tip
Violent dork shit
Violent dork shit
Uh, c'mon
We can be indifferent to the rich
Round the world in a round trip
How do I exists
Avocado fats on my lips
Styles get  on a pit
Ninety-four click
Genocide's a grocery list
Pathogens loaned in a kiss
My lady is the shit
Yeah, she knows what a whip

For Jeane Anthony Ray
Beyond gravity's sway
You know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love
For Jeane Anthony Ray
Beyond gravity's sway
You know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love
Girl, you know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love
Yo, let's get it

The jazz man at the unemployment office
He pointed out them allies in a woman's carcass
The pharaohs lined up in them wooden coffins
They didn't die from flash floods in mid-August
But let me ask you this
Have you been engulfed in a flame
Wonder from where it all came
 called out your name
How you keep the brawl contained
When you're so small in the game
In the halls of pain
Jazz man exhausted in vain
Whole life tossed in the drain
Man, he crossed out your name
Nah, fuck that
C'mon, yeah
But now you fell in love on a whim
Life on the bubbling rim
Homies dunked in the bin
You let your muscles get thin
Remember how Jeane used to store that shovel in the den
Let me show you where it all began
Writing out styles in the trim on the aerosol can
I think you felt it drip from the source
Praise getting whipped like a horse
Had to stick up a Porsche

For Jeane Anthony Ray
Beyond gravity's sway
You know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love

You know the world better than anyone
Show me the true science of the sun
And where we all come from

Show me the true science of the sun

Do the Wop,Jhelli Beam,2009,"I gotta act like David Ruffin
Cuz y'all be softer than Egg McMuffins
Plus you're never really saying nothing
You don't admit to any claim jumping
This is why I have to pay these munchkins to
Clobber goons in locker rooms with waterballons
And sashay with gumption
The heir apparent of the feral lads in American Apparel ads
Rises from the glow of the back-lit keys
The html formatted speak'n'spell door magnet
Looks futuristic and Japanese
But my onomonopoetic Somalia surname
Makes me look four-legged like I got fur, fangs
And a diamond encrusted gun butt in my mud hut
You've hyphenated my dance reprise yet still…
Me, I do the wop with no dance license
Me, I do the wop with no dance license
Me, I do the wop with no dance license
And I ain't got legible handwriting
How the fuck you talk with a cockney patois
When you come from the Rockies have thawed
Plus you got all our parties back logged
When we left everybody slack-jawed
I'm aware you step softly on padded paw
But I know you gave your acorns to gay porn from the waveform
Of your raunchy rap slaw
The oxymoronic tinged band of Guatemalan twins
Isn't worth opening my polka dot lids
The water-resistant faux-hawk gets road blocked
By the color copies of my MOCA pop quiz
But my circuit-bent key tar and icky lens cameraman
The fact that I'm on the shitty end of this ampersand
Makes me what to do the Roger Rabbit in a bomber jacket
To the polyrhythm of the soda pop fizz cuz still
Me, I do the wop with no dance license
Me, I do the wop with no dance license
Me, I do the wop with no dance license
And I ain't got legible handwriting
So y'all can't bite
Show them shoes a bit
Prick those chubby digits
Show them shoes a bit
Prick those chubby digits
Salvaged from the mouths of motors
Plucked from legislative branches
To enact these native dances
Sooth me babbling brook
I'm shell shocked by the blaring red phone
Name checked on the sterling headstone
How can I sell this high-top fade?
Oh wee, throw the grappling hook",https://genius.com/Busdriver-do-the-wop-lyrics
World Agape,Jhelli Beam,2009,"Whoo!
Art rap, art rap, art rap, art rap!
Whoo!
Who better qualified to mediate in the larp discord
With my dewy moleskin brewing cauldron and karmic orb
I'm fully pantsless like the wooly mammoth from the tar pit gorge
Yet I'm David Carradine taking thorazine off the starship oars
No godhead in the blog thread stringing this harpsichord
No tasteful tunes, just tablespoons of parsnip porridge
Of the bleeded ether from the Greenpeacer's alarmist lore
(Chorus)
I'm dashing and windblown
When the world's agape
And I bookend your smiles with unhappy endings
I'm dashing and windblown
When the world's agape
Drop orange rind on the war crime set in the crowded ballot
With my in-laws and Limbaugh singing a power ballad
Their price gouging funds their night outings and flowered phallus
More than spider bites we give them writer's strikes and an endowed outage
The ulcer gargle and dulcimer drone are character-driven
Like the ""no sir"" art show, sulfur marble and American women
This bonus disk shows my showmanship and parenting acumen
(Chorus)
I'm dashing and windblown
When the world's agape
And I bookend your smiles with unhappy endings
I'm dashing and windblown
When the world's agape
Oh what to do
Oh what to do when the world we service is a whirling dervish
And my sidekick aids his surly cervix he's burly and girlish
And I'm Isaac Hayes on a gurney in Zurich saying
""Man up puss! Right now!""
We're telling kids
""Oh yes, you can't""
I'm rushed to hair and make-up on the war-torn beachfront
Where I narrate stuff like a foreign-born creampuff
But I forewarn the teen pups that their core's worn and pre-shrunk
Then in poor form, I triple lutz and I land on my gristle hump
But really
I'm into spooning and spoonerisms
And I make a splash like my hands are two-thirds fish fin
Because when I talk it's like nuclear fission yet it resonates
Like a Ferris Bueller ditch party
Apply the oil-slick sheen of the Blue Man Group
Eat Soylent Green by the two-hand scoop
When you see my face at the newsstand booth
With plutonium in his thermos
I got Obi-Wan disbarred
With my phony gun and lip service
I earned the large gift card
To stir up the stern class kings and nurture the saplings
(Yes you can't... Yes you can't, can't)
I earn medals dirt-pedal with the facial hair of Burt Reynolds
Burnt kettles on my turntables
Make sheet music leak coolant

Asking me all kinds of outlandish questions
Like if I heard that tape of theirs
To be quite honest, I haven't so I just give them blank stares
But one said, ""you know busdriver, I think you're an asshole
And your shit's so weak that it makes my tummy hurt
And when I heard the sound, I didn't feel like I got my money's worth
I think I can serve you right where you stand, you're dead""
Hell man, you didn't harm a hair strand on my head

Get on my shit, all of it
Surprise yourself
Yeah
I've got them underground hip-hop blues, Yeah
Something like that
All my money in the world are some pennies in a dresser drawer
So I made my way to the indy mega store
And I ain't taking no excuses a CD buyer has to offer
Cos I'd have made my payments on my TV, dryer and washer
He looked me in the eye and said ""I can't buy it this week""
I said ""what the fuck"" and a high pitched shriek
I said ""Are you friends with or do you know Driver?""
He said I don't care he can hang himself from a blow dryer""
I got those
I got those CD on consignment blues, Yeah
And they're charging me every dirty thing that I believe
And they haven't paid me, it's certainly my big pet peeve
Check it out
Now they call me Driver
But promoters call me pond scum
They say ""You know you're pretty dope man
But you ain't going nowhere in the long run""
Project Blowed was vocoded on the back of a cardboard boxcar menu
No, my car door is not locked
I invite you inside of my microsmic bubble
I've taken the advice of a project
Brought into the league of legends but I'm still here
With those janky-ass promoters blues (janky-ass promoters)
And when I perform, I stage my death
To collect my money, so that I can pay my rent
I got some early hip-hop blues
I'm performing in the L ring
I'm performing in your girl's house
I'll be performing in your town soon

A school bus driver went off course, if you will, 13 kids on board, he and they missing for more than five hours until the driver turned himself in to an off-duty police officer
The driver had a loaded semi-automatic rifle behind the driver's seat; he's facing federal kidnapping charges. Tonight, as best we can tell, nobody really knows why this happened at all",https://genius.com/Busdriver-wrong-route-lyrics

And the mantra's been scrambled into this crazed non-sequitur

Refusing to join forces with your indie-stud wunderkind
I rather embrace what your city slum undermines
And encourage the idiom bump-and-grind
Sickly glum of unbuttoned minds
I prime my condemned shell to excrete
A lithium honey wine for you frowning f#$%s
When trend arbitrators present my tortured lore adorned
Gags are soaked in chloroform
You get the same if you're poor in form
With your flip full-tuck and triple-lutz into this icy brook
War is sworn on my forlorned psyche's soot

I've got people to disappoint, I got mistakes to make
How can you believe that I'm not a waste of space
Oh I'm sorry to disappoint, I seldom save face
But how can I speak your language

Opposite elephants on sea-saws
Android man-boy befriends the chic, mod tinker bell

Sneakers smell
'Til my every tirade activates Jihad sleeper-cells
'Til flag wavers say, 'please God we need your help'
Still I'm precarious and flat-footed
Like you're arrogant at a gun show
I holler at your Marilyn Monroe
With declarative mumbo-jumbo my narrative unfolds
To a housed narcissism
Parented by a bum hole

Metallic ballad, drum machine mallet
That may release a pallet of celebrity droppings on the cat walk
They were spoon fed to reduce back talk
Give you a bloody, little for your money
Cause I caulked your honey
Just because she got a runny clit
Saying she wants a man in touch with her feelings
But she'd rather get fucked to the ceiling
Hasn't menstruated in months she's concealing
Part of her's sick and breathes and clucks
And eats nothing but chicken feed, ear plugs
A bum is what she wants stricken with greed
She'll have you collecting change into to tin cups
She'll eat up your cum drops like gum drops
But her young twat's hot like sun spots
Fate cannot be determined by a Ouija board
But by the cd and mix boards
To say out the fifth word of this chord against yours
And try to swim to shore
I'm not controlled by a recessive gene
I wore my impressor jeans
Looking for the best of things
Swimming in infested streams
Taking advantage of big chested queens

On the mean streets where you been seen sleep
And your teams weak and that's why
You want your (?)
And mother fuckers are so righteous
Talking bout get rid of the white bitch
Stop rapping high pitched
But it's my niche, I'll do what I wish
I took a leap of faith over a knee brace
But in any case, you're just an empty face
Who drinks henny chased, with a weed that's laced
I've achieved my place
I didn't win it in a sweepstakes
So if you sneak on my estate
It better be by mistake or leave needing a knee brace
Ah Jeez don't hate, we don't high speed chase
We don't speak to cheap skates, or eat beef stakes
Now, with a feta aid I made cheese and papes
And sold heaps of tapes and made niggas replace
But they're snooty ballers, spending most of their time at beauty parlors
But never would I infringe the West or mend and press
Or pinch your breast, cause I been fresh in every way
And I'll singe my flesh if I ever betray
So read 'em and weep and make the coin sweep

And flaunt a denounced wrong

And debase the office building
Sharpened shears
Flashed before your startled peers
An encapsulated tempest
A waterproof seed
Poured into a nigga's outfit
I map personas off camera
While riding low flying winged books
Low flying winged books
Through translucent skin
Breathe soot
Under a precooked smiley-faced sun
From out of the c-section suture
A flock of birds float skyward
As if the laws of physics had no bearing
Nature's tendrils coil
Around the android limbs
I honor the existential loyal minion
I confront the simple truth
And dissect every nuance

To a sky city

Motherfucking penguin suit (OH!)
You know I can’t keep the bank in the loop (OH!)
They underestimate the value of my language soup
What I’m exactly paid so I tax evade (OH!)
I’ve manufactured every single black cliché but I’ve got a problem
I don’t know how to raise children
I just know how to raise money
Without a percentage being withheld
Without giving any to strippers who sniff rails
I can sell anything, split a cell
Give gigabytes of military intel
To any government that doesn’t kiss and tell
Then write a musical starring Kim Cattrall
In general my money’s long, long gone
That’s why I’m selling DVD’s in Hong Kong
With a sad face oblong, I’m selling Pennywise shirts at the Warped tour
Until I’m a Saudi Arabian warlord
I mean… I’ll kill puppies and deforest
To get a plate of food from that smorgasbord
‘Cuz right now motherfuckers eat bleached orchids
I think I need some reinforcements
Somebody other than Dr. Spock cuz I’m raising an awkward tot
Who doesn’t understand that her father’s not
Able to pay that steep mortgage
In a rat race I couldn’t beat a tortoise
And I can’t afford to pay my keyboardist due to extreme poorness
Can somebody out there tell me what a motherfucking D chord is
Now I just spit hot game ‘til my teeth taste like shell casings
My hustle approach is hell raising
I’m selling local businesses Yelp ratings
Siphoning the run-off from the sewage treatment plant in Tijuana
And I’m selling it to women in Beverly Hills as drinking water

But your job is easy
I could get rich on the training run
I don’t know a thing about this enriched uranium
But I’m volatile
I’ll blow a hole in this voting pole so smoke a pole
And bread me out like I was an Arod or BasedGod
And I’ll play god
Have execs jumping up like tased frogs
Or I’m in the hospital breaking into several file cabinets
Taking the identity of dead patients then filing for medical malpractice
Y’all show a bias towards the manufacturers of cyborgs
Not grandmothers on ironing boards or past leaders of Vice lords
I’m outlining my meal plan
By showing how my flow’s so silly
Because what you offer is real bland
And tastes just like hobo chilli (oh no, really)

I may not know anything
But I know everything

I know anything
I know everything
I know everybody
I've been everywhere
I do all the things all the time
I know anything

And I thought that my daughter could do anything
There’s an airforce on her tongue
And there’s an overdue bill on my mind
And there’s a million dollars in a song of mine
And there’s a lack of love in being on the grind
A slice of sun
I give it to you on your darkest days
To fill that gapping hole that came with that garnished wage

Who was conceived on a swivel chair by perfect strangers
Dressed like three little bears and Mommy's cervix as a manger
Cradling the crude fetus a nude Jesus wearing a pair of shoes Adidas
Doing windmills in a yolk sack when daddy plays the showdance
I fought God when she willed my daughter in to existence pouring distilled water on the pistons of my hot rod
Fueled by youthful vigor and I saw it as a the collision of the Earth and Sun
But it was extinguished, with embryonic fluids in a squirt gun
Now dreading her teen years I go to job interviews wearing a shirt stained with baby vomit
Cleaning her ears with a cotton swab while we're in an inner tube being towed by Hailey's Comet
I'll put her first words in a safety deposit
You can think that I'm irresponsible and unfit
But my Pooh Bear won't leave McDonald's with a full stomach
(Where'd I come from daddy?)
I was (?wailing?) Mommy had Daddy's dick fondled and I come quicker than a gieser of love
I have to install the car seat before I drive the bus
And I was like, this weekend is mine
What's with this runny nose?
What do you mean we can't go to the park?
The school's where all of our money goes?
Her shirt's already too small
Stop yelling, I'm just a dumb man and our child's inherently good

 my skin looks like a 
 Tenderonis
Give girls the reddish buttocks
After that see them club members only
The photosynthetics I walk covers up my mummified cult
 blares through me through hundreds of high volts
Due to me being old as fuck
When all the  going on and on about fighting power
Assumed you were talking about Eisenhower
 really looks like we desensitized the shish kebab
But they holler with my dogs like I'm in the Iditarod

Dream state, design  spicy meals
Spirited work ethic culture
Colorful, vast dynasties closing eyes
Opening wide, stretch and yawn
Hope inside, taking second minute

She-Hulk Dehorning The Illusionist,Cosmic Cleavage,2004,"I am, dehorned, by, ego-driven
Evil women, who, disturb, my peaceful living
Even though, I countered her, every eye flutter
My confident, pimp game, is reduced, to a shy mutter
Beautiful, specimen, in, a swim suit
Every dude, wants her to, play, the skin flute
We dated, and she acted, like she was staring, in a film shoot
How bout a peck? A kiss? A slurp? Or something
But she taunts me, being raunchy, and sticks out, her tongue ring
I forgot her, eye color, when I tried to, dry hump her
Torturing me, gives her, personal, thrills, don't forget to take, birth control, pills
Seeing her, when your, dirty, itchy, bed sheets, they'll be seen, corky, by the sex geeks
At least, I'm still loved, by all, record players
But a sprinkle, of sawdust, from salt, and pepper shakers
Cuz its over, flowing, toilets, in my heart
And I bumped my head, on my failed, relationship pie chart
You'll also wanna share, a personal pan pizza 
When aside, a personal band leader
The dirty thought makes you recoil
And you wish a surgeon, would remove my gland, with tweezers
But there's no use, the very notion urges you to hump the disk changer
Ha, I should come with a disclaimer
May cause emotional attachment and suspenseful cliff hangers
I mean really, if I could only kiss strangers
I know my, breath never hissed a pilot light
I'm just a silent sight
Loser! Wimp! Are some, of the pet names
She belittles me, then rewards me
I'm a boy toy, on a test range
You were sensitive, lush
When you broke me off, you gave me correct change
You weird and crazy, bearded lady
Who's condemned me, to endless hours of soft porn
Meeting her in traffic, I'm resorting to honk horns
I go into movies all by myself and climb into a tub of pop corn
She joined the screen actors guild
If she won't fill the dream catcher, I will
Frolicking in the green pastures fields
I took my love song a did a remastered reel
I'm a guinea pig in hamster wheels
I bought an airplane ticket, that goes exactly to where
My court orders randomly and I die with every cold breath of air
And every combed hair, resonates how much this girl don't care
What a lousy place for a smiley face
On your head? On the front of your mind?
It should be on your cunt or behind
Because that's the only place I found any kind of warm sentiment
Some how I weaved the myth
Of a decent person around your good looks
But you've got the sense of a guy cook book
And you treat dinner dates
Like fucking table tennis
Your fucking labels endless
And leads to a corridor
And you've got a playful fetish
Of having your anal crevice
Rammed in by a four door sedan Full of, football players...",https://genius.com/Busdriver-she-hulk-dehorning-the-illusionist-lyrics
Reality Sandwich,Temporary Forever,2002.0,"I'm a mail runner
Squished between an erupting street and an exploding sky
In a hail of numbers
I'm  between knuckles and forces I  out of trojan horses
To screams  I sit undressed in Fuddruckers  motherfuckers
But while I record a sound the motion pictures meet
Because I'm where rivers and oceans great each other
And I spent the day at the fool party with an Anti-flag
Instead of being at the pool party with a scantily clad
Walking boob job whose snob, I grip on her nipples when I speak to her
 and artificial sweetener
 into a jar of pickles and I'm obscene with her because I'm a reality sandwich
Clumsy ugly unflinching with a side of mayo tomatoes  and a  brought to you
When I beckon the word the  cries to me but you can't sound it out 
Your ideal talent scout, the voice of reasoning between to pieces of bread that
 and speaks to the dead
But to hang out with us you need a lot of duct tape
And a wallet sized photo of your brainstem
Because I've  DJ way up in  and often relay race  with your ears shrieking when it sounds
You've probably made a wrong turn when you wanted to end up in the lyricist lounge
You know  found over there but over hear we undergo a fiercest scrounge
To compile a style ball for your reality sandwich
Would you care to take a bite of this reality sandwich?
I think I've seen that you've nibbled on my reality sandwich
I'm an airborne pathogen
Mushed between sheet music and a composer’s eye
The rarest form of craftsmen
I feel that I get beat tapes from the omnipotent
But he has crappy drum tracks and 
And I don't have a snappy comeback
What do you expect from a moldy reality sandwich and unhappy lunch sack?
But it wants a little taste
Because I'm a nerd eating pimple paste who used to work in a missile base
Building weapons of mass destruction
But now I form shrubs instead of nuclear arms I give open armed hugs
But what would you know about that you live in Burbank and me I have a word bank
You wore a necktie to accentuate your crotch
I usually like to meditate squat, you're like a menstruating twat
Or would you rather count the units that my songs are selling
Sitting on the front porch eating some watermelon
But how can you feel that way about a sparring heavy weight
Who changes his appearance like Fletch staring Chevy Chase
But when I go to work, I can't seem to put my car in an empty space
Because I flunk or fail to the point that my panderous box is full of junk mail
So I pull the skunk sail and get more  said the risktaker and compass  rather be an unfit benchwarmer
If I play it safe the turntable becomes a cotton gin
My rotten  is my pixelated Nirvana
I lay untouched in a room of hungry buzzards
In order to take that first bite you need a lot of honey mustard
I tried the reality sandwich and now I sleep in an airbed speaking to ground control
I'm kind of a square peg in a round hole kind of guy
You know the songs over, when my fingers and the drum machine
Have been run over by a lawn mower
The songs over!
(Yeah)
Would you like to have a bite of this reality sandwich?
My shelf life ain’t the half life of an isotope but I feel like the afterlife has always been twice as dope

Ellen Disingenuous,UnKnown,2008.0,"I've got a series of beefs and cues from the bemused funkery
Riding emus in a halter tee
She's chasing her P's and Q's for the shimmying dollar tree
My defused metabolic key
It's not a studded muffins
Or be-speckled and blaxploited
I begrudged an onion
Holding teakettles like asteroid bits
There's no way I'd date her
Acting like an eighth-grader
I should have my face lasered
I was putting a wad of genetic material
Into every other jelly bag
When you exit wasted
Pirouetting on the helipad
The sound of bank mergers for the underpaid workers
And the frankfurters in deadly hands
So her tentacles look just like a purple mollusk
My dissension is imminent and parabolic
Many of the sexes are fixed in prelims
Dimples with candy tips and a landing strip
And like an X-Mas tree trimmed
And I'm serving a person burger speaking against a third term
With my parasol ripped
Look at those meaty thighs would be be CGI'd
Who else goes to career day with a ""B"" word seismographed
With a marshmallow suit made of fiberglass
And a name tag saying ""No one did ask""
A token black typecast in my exasperated death
I should probably set up a resized JPEG
Of my Wienerschnitzel hut, instead
I sell her an ad for a defried page head
Now I'm too fickle, my heart's peanut brittle
And if it don't amount to the findings in the Concord
I should be spiking the punch bowl
To make these hussies more cooperative
Her name is (name is, name is, name name name name name...)

Ellen Disingenuous
She's of the best elk
Her sexy breast milk's
So good
It's so strenuous
To make Neo-feminism palatable
Ellen Disingenuous
She's screen-tested
So you know
You see her pink flesh delving the void
It's so strenuous
To make her grand disexuality work

For every uncle with a Terabithia jaunt
When I wear my trivial ankh
To chaperon your lovely Milk Duds
My credit build-ups
Our committee is swamped
And the druggie's pill cup
But I lunge at her with a sponge loofah
And a cannon-powered that she bazooka
You're an incubator built for a young pupa
But I mishandled the money shot
It's tantric and pampered
A big  at your scrunchy spa
You're a man-eater
When you get to nibble on your bloody spot
Turn on my lights into a Telenovela
I'm a helluva fella
With a profile pic like cocaine uranium
What's your name again
What's your name again
What's your name...
I've had my fill
Of the comment fowl with the bone density of under pressure
Full-bodied chicken strips
I am like ""tsk tsk.""
I could paint a strip
Of your home pregnancy test royal blue
Tesla coil fuse blew
Your tummy turns
In a seafood stew
And be who do
Plus I saw Calvin Klein and David Newsmaker
My figurative outline issued their induced labor
P-funk She-Hulk
Fitted a shoegazer for a box of bits
And hunted pit bulls as foster kids
Oh why did this hussie trip
Encourage her to 
On the bicycle
For a incidental pregnancy acquittal
But her respect's ballin'
I'm crestfallen...what's your name again?
Oh yeah it's",https://genius.com/Busdriver-ellen-disingenuous-lyrics

For countless fortnights, for this forthright
Canny canning
So we plead for what you can't believe
And career suicide, poolside
By the candied landing
I withstood an unwound mortal coil
At the hands of deputized beauticians
This hundred pound torso broils
In the Gap ads and plastic slag of New Britain
Unmanned imaginarium, I implore you
On your gut-caked eve
Pull me from Los Angeles' large intestines
And the teeth of Charlton Heston's fleas
The nail-biter stratagem hallmark
Constitute the rock layers of this product push
That ethical value base doesn't change how you taste
Or the law's arch
As known by this war headed octopus
Your rogue circles are nudged and summed
As mere collagist's twig kraut
So sell those selves with infomercial aplomb
And a face-fitting pig snout, figure it out
Canucks! Canuck!
Open your arms, ask yourself
""Am I dangerous or endangered?""
I may imagine my way to
Quebec and back, Quebec and back
And I may dream my way to
Quebec and back, Quebec and back
But I'll probably die on the way to…
The jackknifing rancor of your thousand eyed face
Lends itself to militarized hobnobbing with Don Johnson
I leave cracked icing on course to some galvanized base
And I barren showy spouse for snowy alps
Cradling political asylum

And then we go through a range of emotions like happy to sad like when I share beds

I'll be declared dead when I'm unsupervised around her love pudding

I do too much unnecessary thinking
For me to get much of that hairy pink thing
Can't settle for love rather be at a gentleman's club

Stop complaining no need for explaining
I'm not the type to be playing with your emotions

Women and men are from the sparks or the stars
Never (?did happen?) to all cats and the dogs
Always trying to hard
Wanna get out but you let it go too far
'cause your trapped in a house that has prison bars
Kicking in car doors
Punching holes in walls
Dealing with those in laws


Dressed like an off duty live new debutante
I met her at the Thai food restaurant
Don't worry just 'cause my crude letter font

How political figures'll make a high priest dry heave cough

You love still that we off
Yeah

You don't deserve this love
I want it all
You don't deserve this love
I want it all
You don't deserve this love

What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich
What kind of love is this
Cuz it feels like I struck it rich

Let's brainwash the general masses
And treat all labels like a medical practice
I feel like taking the hypocratic oath
To where I doctor these rich anecdotes
I tell my peeps I got the Hispanic vote
Like I'm really tryna be a congressman
I realign myself but about a trend
Nigga I just need love like a primadonna
Imma roll weary worry warts
Speaking in some eerie slurred snorts
I believe that my kind will be sentenced
To death by the superior court
So fuck with ya boy

(Fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)
Show me love (fuck with ya boy)

Never Caught,UnKnown,2014.0,"You will never ever catch me

not see the light in me and it's outlandish
They still want me to throw colors on this cloud canvas
I look inside my mind and find anxiety, no piety
I'm an OG and you have to trust me accordingly
My nigga Lotus told me I can't be caught
My homies winced when I dipped my toe in that free thought
But if you look inside my mind you'll find a gorgeous see
At Normandy
And these philosophical art opinions informing me
 so I rap in every place
Driver been on that sour  imagine every place
This country's been fucked since way back, I call it statutory rape
But show my consumer face
And they so uncivil with the little that we got
But let's go back and spit a little bit of pot
Roll  by a bigoted cop on the way to ramble riot every bit that's on the clock
Been on those sports to give them what we got
My heart's in the middle a rock
 derivative socks
So I'm picking the lock on summer homes
Political dissidents can't speak
But this is the fault of your antiques
My nigga you in the guest room might give them an ipad give them the 
And everything that we can need
My nigga, we the new breed
I know
That you want me to doubt the severity of it all
Fill up my bong
And shut the fuck up

But I'm like your underground radio, and the boy-to-girl ratio, is swinging way in my favor
Plus I came with people, who think with evil, using mics like lightsabers
Where the L.A. underground, police shoot rubber rounds, at our peaceful protest
But they need more than those firearms, to distinguish Driver's charm, 'cause he makes hip-hop people feel so fresh (Fresh!)
So, aren't you in the know? Is it dark blue or indigo? The color of what is considered cutting-edge
Well, I don't know about your ideals, just keep your eyes peeled, 'cause message boards are full of butting heads

Would the crowd-pleasers, through the loud speakers, renew in your faith in arts
Your TV's been all on day, and you'll have a mouth fever, so your TV must be taken apart

Once you examine all the style's features, you'll evolve from a wild creature, and understand that this is as great as

Who has a lot of raps to offer

Watch all the people surround

To a body that is ice cold and dead

Rule over solid waste
Our artistic merit is questionable
We'll fall on our face
And I can't bare the sight
Not to sound pragmatic
But our parents were right
This ain't adequate
But you can always seek refuge under…
Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Return to the bourgeoisie while I sift through debris
You view the poverty line as a threshold
For truth in pricey slums
This ain't art school, it's a shark pool
Of well-groomed yuppie scum
And they got orders to kill
Watch them fashion your cell
How'd they get a recording deal
When they're wack as hell
But the chicken-scratch in your sketch book
It mirrors what you loath

There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
They got easels to stain, and uh
People to blame, with their
Egos inflamed, and their
Neat codenames
I saw your sub-genre in a passing glance
It was you and your DJ in matching pants
Sleeping pills and record sleeves
Defaced museum pieces
Concert-goers flailing arms
Taxidermy for the nouveau riche
I don't need this
I don't need this…
