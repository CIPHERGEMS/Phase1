The Most Beautifullest Thing In This World,The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World,1994.0,"Y'all mythological niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this Edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who
(Who? Who?) So who? (Who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waiting for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like an organic compound
That's the way of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the Earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damaja amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I internally, get in you

The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

What you folks want, yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want, yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want
We got the funk so come on down",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-the-most-beautifullest-thing-in-this-world-lyrics
Candi Bar,He’s Keith Murray,2003,"She looks like a (4x)

She looks like a movie star
Like a chocolate candy bar

(She looks like a)
Heya love love, you little fly lady bug
Come and swing this episode wit more from up above
With them Earl Jeans on fitting tight like a glove
You little Cinammon Toast Crunch, come show me some love!
Slim goodie got tittle litties
Yeah but she's a picture post card pretty fat kitty little bitty, WHOO!!
You're provoking me, giving me the notions
To make me wanna lick your funky emotions
She can make a crippled man walk and a blind man see
How can I put this? hmm
She can make the Grinch love Christmas
How can I manifest her uniqueness in vernacular?
(Like a chocolate candi bar) yeah that describes her


(She looks like a)
I seen her at the park on the black top watching the kids play
Hey style complimented the sunny day
There's a mild nature about her
Gentle but firm for all the bullshit life brought her way
You reflected beauty of a starless night by far
Like Billy Joel said ""I take you just the way you are!""
I had a crush on you since the days of love tap
Karate shoes you had jelly cornrows with the peas in the back
I knew you'd grow to be a fine specimen someday
You the very inspiration for the song I sing
The way you sprint the runway and scale the catwalk
Your life is a movie and the camera's never off
It's like love at first taste, coming deep from within
From your DNA structure to your whole body over
Your beauty is respected in the eye of the beholder
I love that little chocolate bar tatted on your shoulder


(She looks like a)
Oh yeah the time is now and the place is here
So come a little closer let me kick it in your ear
And share this wit you girl you super official
I just wanna bite you girl you look good like a Snickers
Ooh la la, ah wee wee, walking by looking all like I exctasy
Got doe ma didn't know, good gracious alive!
Aw shuck now, there she go
Hey yo come and rest your feet my little chocolate soufflet
I know you're tired you been running through my mind all day
And Oh My Goodness! can I get a witness?
This roundy brownie is something to see
I never had a craving like this before, I'm addicted
Lord have mercy! please give me strength!
Dark, rich and thick like a fresh baked cake
Just thinking of your shape girl I catch a toothache

We just buggin out a little bit, showing versatility",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-candi-bar-lyrics
The Rhyme,Enigma,1996.0,"Now for next to little or nothin' I be rippin' up every function
With scientifical mad man consumptions
With mass productions of mass conjunctions
I display new ways of MC destruction
Cause ain't nothin' better than the shit I got
Makin' niggas jump off the roof and roof-tops
I put the hip in hop and the don't in stop
And the clips in Glocks, then I rock box your block
My hypothesis on this is
You niggas better come in terms of my vocabulary quick
Or get dissed, my brain bleeds mental complex feeds
Bring it on kid I got exactly what you need
Twisted metaphors to get your ass in star wars
Im'a live forever like Bob Marley just because
The mad matador metaphor rips the hard core
For him and his them and theirs you and yours

And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

The most beautifullest vocabulist
Punches phony mc's dead in their esophogaus
My analysis is roughly callouses
You better practice if you want to challenge this
I'm symbolic to the sun moon and stars
You gettin' knocked out the box no matter who you are
The funk phat tracks lures you to listen
As my vocals bend your brain up in the fetal position
Learn a quick lesson of mic aggression
So when I walk down the street there'll be no second guessing
Now you can walk the walk talk the talk
Pack burners all day but you're still fireproof like an ashtray
I'm a scientist in the mix like Plyx
Turnin' all you fly emcees back into maggots
Top prop soil, watch me bubble and boil
Keep it Grand Royal as you fold like foil

And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

I played the many thousand roles of street life
Showed Whodini that the freaks come out in broad daylight
Me and my crew be tight like Lavren and Shirley
Rollin' through all ya'lls hoods pullin all ya'lls fly girlies
Emcee's always bitchin', that makes my style all hard
I roll with nobody but God and the Squad
Me and my troops be knockin niggas out the size of Zeus
Lettin the OJ juice loose on phat tracks E-d produced

And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-the-rhyme-lyrics

(Keith Murray you did that! Talk to 'em!) Yeah!

Keith Murray, the lyrical Hannibal flow cannibal
Animalistic tough guy man handle you
I came into this bitch my style hardcore
Then I heard a hater say he ain't fire no more!
What?! That was me standin on your block with the razor blade
In my mouth back when hip hop was hip hop
For those who don't know or forget
To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who he called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall
Then arena to arena with R. Kelly
Who made you feel beautiful while gettin lifted (Me)
I rocked bells with L you must be stupid
I don't need no permission, to do what I do
Come through and show the whole world how I do
 (*Keith Murray)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together (*Right here, yo!)

And who you know get out of jail and get them figures
Get back into the game like fuck the system
Hit the studio and bless y'all with Fatty Girl
Who got 'em sayin badonkadonk around the world
Now I'm hearin I got anger issues on the street
The only anger I got, is when I'm fuckin up a E beat
Keep runnin' your lips and I'm a have you dancin' like the crips
Turn your six pack to some barbeque rib tips
Mother hot damn this man jam like a phone
And plus the shit I get more draws than a dresser
When I flow, there's no one deafer
Make you make the ugly face like Lamont's Aunt Esther
You can't stealth me my tank is too healthy
Even negative situations help me
When E lace the beat, and me and Ty bust one
Trust son that's money in the bank like a trust fund

That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

Yo! Keith Murray is your (?) MC Ultra
With the sickest comeback like nigga I told ya
Honeys sweat me like condensation, mind affiliation
House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play fuck around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Niggas can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better (Can't nobody)
That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better
I'm gonna be right here to get your shit together

High as Hell,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"(Phase one)
I grab the Henny and twist the top
Guzzle it that's when the reaction starts
I split the chalk with the dutch
Had the hash in the greenery, then the L get sparked
Keith Murray's never smokin' on babbith
Niggas give me dirt and I throw it in the garbage
Actual facts, writin exact, sacks of African Black
I smoke two back to back
I smoke so much I choke out fire alarms
With the towel under the door feel the effect of the bar
Put Visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Looked in the mirror, said to myself yo you high as hell
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
Inahle it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound*, blow it out yo nose

I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
(Phase 2)
Me and the Funk Doctor Spot up top on the hop
Block two big jig hot shots coppin mots
Seasons slice precise, ice 'n' tights
Chickenheads that circle the block twice
If you chokin then pass cuz it's not a game
Bitches hit my blunts and never feel the same
They start actin strange and kinda erotic
I try to tell her you ain't nothin bout no chronic
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
And light a fat one up for the sergeant general of New York
Who determine gettin lifted kill brain cells maybe
If it wasn't for weed, niggas would be goin crazy
So smell it from afar, comin from the bar
Or rushin out when I open up the car door
Whether home or party in a bag or a jar
Put that lah in the air and represent what is stand for

I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke full of tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
(Phase 3)
I'm not sayin I'ma a pothead, cuz I'm not
I'm just sayin that I smoke alot
Catch me in V.I.P. smokin with 
Dennis Scott
Or after the show in the parkin lot
I only buy weed from a selective few
Cuz niggas is wicked and they will get you
I ran outta blunts got some paper from your mother
She had extra weed so we rolled another
No doubt, I hear you out
Before I roll my L, I think the cancer part out
I'm uptight cuz I missed the buddah stop before the flight
And damn we gon be away for like 12 nights
So here I am in Amsterdam gettin high again
You know what, come to think of it, yo, I'll have a Heineken
Inhale it through your mouth, freeze like you froze
Then *blowing sound* blow it out yo nose

I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke of the tram
Get 3-Dimensional visions like CD-ROM
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
Look in the mirror say to myself, ""Yo, you high as hell""
I inhale a gray smoke of the tram
Get 3-Dimensional luck like CD--
I put some visine in my eyes so no one can tell
I don't give a fuck so you can go to hell

We smoke it up y'all, we smoke it up y'all, we smoke it up y'all
Get lifted uh uh
Y'all know what time it is

Get Lifted,The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World,1994.0,"Uh huh, yeah
One two, one two
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to""
Smokin' up blunts
Mad Dog 2020
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya""

I grab the forty, rip off the skirt
Guzzle it, grab the mic and come out the wood works
When shit's thick and no time to think
Keith Murray gets busy off of Basic Instinct
I puff an L and drink some liquor
Sit down and write a jam that receive the muhfuckin' stick-up
As God as my witness, with the sickness of a cannibalist cannabis
I floats like a cumulus
My perpetual rebel intellectual
Won't catch a bad experience with hallucinogenics either
I float strictly with the cannabis sativa
As my speech falls deeper than the scriptures
And graphic opponents, just like Picasso paintin' pictures
If my eyes ain't red, it's all in my head
Once said by a Ph.D med
Legalize and I'll advertise, 'cause

""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to""
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up
""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up this funk, fire up this funk""

This the real deal, not a publicity stunt
I gets high like if the man in the Moon be puffing blunts
But verily, barely, merrily, is it dope or the dream?
Step into my chamber of intravenous smokescreen
I captivate it then motivate it, jealous of my desire
Smoke it down to the fire, anything to get a little higher
Hop in to college, but to be truthfully frank
Weed is knowledge, cause it makes me think
I pick anatomy and hem reality like Jah
Rastas read the bible, after puffin sensimillia
And the Sensi it gets me as a fly
I ain't bullshittin', you can ask Bill Clinton, he can verify that

""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to""
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up
""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up this funk, fire up this funk""

Step into this intersection and take this rap
I got a vicious plot, but first take me by the weed spot
I do this for my niggas locked down runnin' capers
Smokin herb, in the bible papers
But how does it feel when you got no fire
And kyant pass de dutchie pon de left hand side
What the fuck? Who the fuck wanna fuck with the six shot shooter?
I murder you over buddha
What I discuss'll bust a rhyme style nucleus
And roast them ghostes, puffin hocus-pocus
So kid, pass that bomb trom, word bond
So I can toke it with more wins than a python
Different Strokes for different folks
He like the chocolate Thai, you like to float with the green skunky smoke
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized to the funky sound 'cause

""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to""
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up
""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get

This That Shit,Insomnia - The Erick Sermon Compilation Album ,1996.0,"Up early in the mornin through the break a night
Niggas be on the block uptight gettin knifes ready to fight
And release, anger from the belly of the beast
Like work release, on the fuckin police
I'll percussion bodies like drums and tracks
And break backs a six maniac, poppin they gums and facts
I bugs the clubs runnin with thugs
Makin niggas bite the bullet and hug the slugs
Ya whole genetics is pathetic
Got me ready to set it, on a shot M1 type wetted
But instead I blow you buck fifty cross the face
For tryin to look hard in the first place
I need beer and a lotta noise in my ear
In a rowdy atmosphere to even think clear
And all praises due to the LOD's and
Fuck the COPS who try to lock us up and throw away the keys

Now this goes out to my niggas on lockdown
And all my niggas on the streets, This That Shit
(repeat 4X)

I gets to flippin and the phoney can't hold me
Like dyslexia on cerebral palsey with styles, y'all niggas know me
And howI drop, physical science on your whole alliance
Try it, what? I Shoot to Kill like motherfuckin Mad Lion
Who is this doin this emphatic type a disco alpha beta
Funkadelic fuckin emphasis, from the funk abyss
Blowin up the spot with the pump-rump
Shakin pistol grip, losin niggas in the plot
I got you out there like Sonny and Cher
I don't give a fuck niggas goin make me hurt some'in up in here
You get that ass kicked quick fast in a hurry
Tryin to ready the mad styles of Mr. Keith Murray
Tryin to step up to my respected bass and treble level
Will get your head beat in with a shovel
And the only thing that could stop me from gettin sloppy
Is when the hook comes in by the E-double


I'm sick, I kick the type of shit that make you violent
Make the jails crowded, and have everybody talkin bout it
See I be universally, university
Purposely droppin it, psychomatically
Where I'm from is only real hard times
So when I bust on the mic I bust with real hard rhymes
And I'm strapped, with a posse that's ready to snap
And a nigga who make beats like we live in rap
You get do fiend on the scene please
I spread MC's like some old crazy skin disease
Operation murderation radication on your whole staff
Tryin to find your way down Carlton Ave",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-this-that-shit-lyrics

Realize my Squad be contagonized
I think the devil's in this beat, fuckin with my speech
Makin me do his dirty work
Makin niggas kill each other on the streets
Mo murder, mo murder
Make no mistake, baby L.O.D. traditional
Don't make me have to come lookin for you
So, see what I'm sayin and watch your mouth
Cause my motherfuckin Squad hits the streets like a blackout
What is exactly real? What is represent?

Call my name and I'll come runnin, gunnin

Verse Two: keith Murray
My Squad comes in all shapes, sizes and colors
All you niggas seem to hate us but your baby's mothers love us

Hot to Def,Enigma,1996,"1000 degrees Hot

Continuously, yeah
Who's that crazy nigga
Drinkin crazy pussy out of crazy straw
Kicking crazy hardcore, crazy metaphors
When I rap competitions perform disappearing acts
Niggas ask why the Squad be on it like that
Cause we stay with the lethal dosage
Click on the Mic MC's run like roaches
Truthfully I think them niggas is gay
Always havin a party with no DJ
I had to hold my head in disbelief
Them short winded niggas tried to smoke the chief
Of the frontal leaf Keith
Knowing damn well they can't win
My style is rougher than army gear and old timb
The east coast say ill
The west coast say ill
My squad is def they don't give a fuck
They say kill
Cause we can all sing together
But we can't talk together
That's why I pack the black gat up under the leather
And keep it hot

It's 96 degrees in the shade
1000 degrees

I got nuts like Almond Joy, like Mounds you don't
I say and do a lot of things some fake rappers won't
Now I'm the show shocker plus the show stopper
Down with makin G's and all the block clockers
Down with L.O.D., the motherf-ing cop droppers
Down with Def Squad flying through your hood in choppers
Yeah we done been in more shit in the past year
Than the bloods and crips care to hear
Ear to ear, Glock to hand, Mic to mouth, resuscitation
Psychosomatic creation
Killing off the nation of perpetration
Player hating, bringin confrontation
I'll shoot your hips up and make you bogle like Jamaicans
I'm doing my thing, if you feel me do your thing
Y'all niggas know my style
I smoke weed on trains and planes
Murderous material submerging from my brain
Chumpin top dollar niggas into small change
And make it hot


I'm the unfuckwitable incredible lyrical individual
Boy your not suitable
I work wonders over the beats
It's no wonder phony MC's get out numbered
Timberlands get tumbled
Relax your head
Accomodations and compliments of the infrared
Theoretically, hypothetically, practically
Actually ain't nobody fucking with me
I'll sell your stupid ass the Brooklyn Bridge
If you think an MC in your camp can fuck with the kid
I want the sun not to shine for six months, to see who fronts
While the Squad light up the sky with blunts
If you catch a nigga dreaming
Thinking he can fuck with my enterprise
Wake him up, smack em, make him apologize
Cause we be on their lemonade type shit
I ain't no faggot but you derelicts can suck my dick
I make it hot",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-hot-to-def-lyrics

There's an outbreak in ya outta state committee
You seen it (yeah yeah you know it)
And if you got it... (ain't scared to show it)
You want the bad guy - here I am
I got them hoes on Gilla cam
Throwin' the drawers in the ceilin' fan
You as small as a kilogram
I'm an airplane ridin' over Colombia, ya middle man
I'm the boss
Stock tha Binaca
Shut up all the gossip, bring the rosta
I whoop ass like Ike Turner any day
When I stomp emcees out I yell ""Annie Mae???""

They gon' get that wig done fa' diggin' on Doc
Find me 'round the aisle in frozen food

Yo Troy, turn me up so I can conductthe disco inferno
Oklahoma aroma (uh)
I smell the roof on fire without Parliament
Just Def Squad shit, dig it
Rhymes I be like liquid swords
You abandon ship, real niggas stay aboard (word)
I'm flexin' hittin' you in the mid-section
Drop for protection. Cuttin' you clean like a ""C"" section
I puts it down in my field. I sport a vest
No need for a Brooke Shield kneel
E, an African boy with charisma
A lyrical giant bigger than Lane Bryant
Su-per rhymes be twilight zone warp speed true indeed
Don't forget boy I'm still hittin' swithes
In my Lexus truck, flaggin' down ugly bitches (word up)

The major difference is in many different instances
You drinkin' too much Guinesses
Now look at all the witnesses (huh)
I told you one thing for sure
When I gets down son, I keep it raw
Break the law from here to Arkansas
Focus, I be the mostest, the dopest
Rhyme flow bounce atrocious
Bag of weed, my niggas smoke this. Shit
I be stacking in jams
While I be packin' in what's happening
I'm charged with interstate trafficking
Rhyme calisthenics will make you see the the medic
Shit will break you down in order
For to make M.C.'s like the alphabetics
Yo, yo just go there practice
The fact is you do not listen
You go ahead and get slapped up with a cactus

I'm fresh for 9-6 you suckas. Keith Murray now
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Word up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Busta Rhymes
Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah

Now if you know the words then you can surely rap along
Go against the grain and surely get stomped strong
My squad is too high to get over
L.O.D. is too low to go under
I'll rain on your brain and give you visions of thunder
See everybody loves Keith Murray 'cause I'm on the top
But i know ain't nobody fuckin' with me if I ever drop
It's all about the bread. Spread taught to me by E and Red
Fuck them niggas talkin' out the side of their head
Different day same shit. I heard a dope beat
But if E didn't do it, then you know I can't fuck with it
Here's something you all can understand
Fuck you coming from the fuck you man
Livin' in drama comma, trauma bubbling like lava
On site bomber to all wack rhymers
And if you ain't tough don't wear my logo
And if you ain't fly you can't play with my yo-yo
Cause who's pockets is fattest matters
I'll serve famous Keith Murray's beef curries
Scattered rappers on platters
For tryin' get at us, knowing we the baddest
With major operation, mental observation status, see
I used to love her then I got some common sense
Now it ain't funny, the bitch better have my money (word up)

Lace the chronic with the bomb-ba, hash the tye
Blaze 'em up 1 time for my partner in crime
Who can I on my hip (why) cause niggas trip
Pull a burner, all you know is a murder occurred
A curb swerver wannabe server slash baller. Got
Dome call hauled to the mortician for silly ambitious
I'm nice and precise, hard like rock
You shook like dice and pop like Glock
Amy shit knock the shelves (yo, yo)
Witness this nigga ro, trigga flow, digga ho
Niggas ass out, passout, excessively
Fuckin' with this manic-depressive will be the lesson of your life
Poiled rotten and plottin' and double shottin'
Packin', always rapping but smacking a lot of action
I am in the house smelling like contra-band
I demand your mic in hand, seriously as a man run it
Verse Five: Redman
Ay yo, watch these 5 niggas stand up in triple pod
Circle back to back scoping all angles
Why does hip-hop circumference start gettin' tangled?
They drop 1 by 1 in the dark gettin' strangled
I come fresher than Summer's Eve please
Squeeze your wack-ass amphetamine rhyme drug-related
I'll make sure your loot and your wife and kids are confiscated
The lawnmower, Red do damage to circuit breakers
Go ahead and hype them niggas up, let 'em go
Just a blow from the invincible will show 'em I'm original
Freeze, I'm like, Baskin and Robbin I'm robbing Haagen-Dazs
And the whole Hit Squad target
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, the potency
That I blow from my mouth will no doubt choke Jesus
Travelin' around the world with no Visas or American Express
Just Jamaican excess (ha!). Can I impose on your cipher?
Been rippin' shows since your moms was foldin' your diaper
Niggas see me up top, dolo daily
Catch ease 600 V on the mobile trailin' back to A.T.L
Swell some more heads with that Long Island sound
That be thicker than cornbread (money)
Jersey tales from from the hood without Sonny
And I know niggas want me
That's why my blade keep me company

Intro:
Rock on. All my peoples up top rock on. All my peoples down low rock on. All
My peoples on the left rock on. All my peoples on the right. Word up. Def
Squad rock on
Verse 1:
Well it's the supersonical ginintonical
Ask your chronicles splatter crews all you hear is ahh and ouhs
Time to face the music bring you down to Earth like Poppa Smurf
I'm worldwide like on the web in your turf
With full fledge rap pack with anxiety attacks
For those that thought I wouldn't be back
With that bone chillin' horror killin' all on goin' drama
Save the rah rah for your mama
Bragadoshis prone to static
Come through the jam and wreck the mic by force of habit
Tantalizin' make you feel good like cryin'
I can't be dissed so you can stop tryin'
And Keith Murray will prevail
So you can eat a shit sandwich and go to hell
Hook:
I got the skunky funky illest funk flow
For the glamorous scandalous world of radio
""now this song is from all of us to all of them"" (x2)
Verse 2:
Yo I throw the beat up in the cobra clutch
Hit it with the Midas touch
Dig up in the mic just like a gold rush
Never ran never felt the need to run
They know not to come cause they all get some
I'm still fabulous still mackadoshis
My dj still cut it the closest
So who's an error when's a never?
I melt through your butter leather
And then I splatter through your Gucci sweater
Deep as a river in a ragin' flood
I come with open arms showin' nothin' but love
Comin' less than zero modern day hero
Deliver hot shit just like Dominos
Keep it movin' or get it on
Cause money talks and bullshit runs the marathon word is bond
Non stoppin' mic shockin' bottles poppin'
Word up son you we keep it rockin'
Hook
Verse 3:
I'm like a character and my life is a movie
Groupies step to me
Do me
Try to sue me
Because I make a record got money in a car
I'm a star?
Naw naw naw that's bullshit paw
In the black range look ya never ever worry
Parked in the front I hear voices sayin' ""That's Keith Murray""
The name of the game is fame
You know the price you recognize the God like Christ
Masses of posses packed up schemin'
Ladies love me they keep on screamin'
Expressin' all the feelin' of the world today
Some might listen to my music and try to say
Nothin' other than ""Yo this shit is dope""
And in the everyday life struggle Murray goes for broke
From day to day month to month year to year
I swear I tear any mic any stage anywhere
I be the standards of which excellence is measured
So for me to rock all day it'll be my pleasure

What a Feelin’,Enigma,1996.0,"Kaboom! Guess who stepped in the room?
Lookin' like the creature from the Black Lagoon
There's gonna be a 187 real soon
If niggas up in here don't give me some elbow room
I'm runnin' with the Legion of Doom
Like a pack of wild wolves foamin' at the mouth on the full moon (Au)
I track range between space and time
And push wigs back like receding hair lines
That's the essence of the effervescence
As this melodic dynamic shit progresses
A mic murderer for hire
As I sit back and watch your little gimmick image backfire
Under the circumstances in any order of events
I be with sick niggas rollin' thick
Dissin the system got America mad at me
Like my name is O.J. Simpson

Get off the d.k. you pitty pat bitch
Stepped into the party people wonderin' if I'm a start some shit
Prisoner of the media very often
'Cause people be blowin' little shit out of proportion (Aha)
False information and bogus arithmetic
Got everybody stuck on stupid, misinterpreting shit (Yeah)
How could I? Why should I damage my career? (Uh)

I got the illest crew in the industry
We could go to war for 30 years like foreign countries

Man fuck bitches, I'm gettin money
And laughin at these clown ass niggas like they funny
The grand imperial with milky material
I'll be the surprise in the bottom of your cereal
One thing I gotta say, my Squad never lost it
Unlike you corny MC's out there who Farrah Fawcett
Can't rhyme, runnin' your mouth all the time
While Def Squad sit back, enterprising perfect crimes (Yeah)
Got the Funk Lord squeezin' the life out of keyboards
While each MC tear the frame out of mic chords (Uh)
Yo I was in the bullpen with them niggas pullin' heists
Grown ass men crying like little mice, but I'mma bounce true indeed
Cause punk ass police only bagged me with two ounces of weed

I freak a technique Goin Way Back like Just-Ice
And don't think twice because I'm nice
I come from the Mothership unknown to man
With a blunt in my hand, a mic in the other hand
God damn I slam I jam like this
Sure nuff, my rap style is Cold Crush
And plus, I tears the roof off the mothersucker
My brother, fly shit that makes Stevie Wonder
Heyyyy, who can it be now watch out
It's the E live in 3-D with Keith and R-E-D

And I ahh... get-it get-it get-it like Luke
For those, who don't believe my skills get these
I got mad expertise, for all you duck MC's

I wanna know who's up in here, before I pull the trigger

[Is New York up in here? HELL YEAH
Is Def Squad up in here? HELL YEAH
Is NJ up in here? HELL YEAH
The Green Beret's up in here! HELL YEAH]

Verbally, I sew the frame up like 
Trapper
John M.D.

Count Dracula, back with the, tow-truck with the
Get Biz like Mark fuel-injected like Maximus
My style sicker than an AIDS victim drinkin forty-five malt liquors
I roll the spliff up
The underground, slam, 
shock like Shazam
Check my Jams get Def when I kick Methods like Man
Computerized Robocop sounds I drop in sequence
Funky to death 
so ask that old bitch where the beef went
When I do em, I glue em, stick em like Patrick Ewing
My shit bumps like Puerto Rican people moved in
Next door, I get raw with the grrrahhhh!
Call four-one-one cause I'm Ghetto Red Hot
Bo bo bo! Funk Doctor Spock catch a bruisin
My style gets respect fifty Muslims
You hang on strings like loose ends, with my hands on the nine
Watch yo nugget bitch, I get busy with mines

How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines)
How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines
It's Keith Murray)]

I come rollin in 
when I see that low flow
Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard
I brings classic drama microphone enbalmer
Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of

We ain't comin' for no bullshit
Niggas talking all that yakkity-yak, word up

Here's to Mr. Keith Murray, the Mr. Pictionary
The Mr. Quick To Fuck Shit Up In a Hurry
On the mic I'll squash your little Ms. Philosophy
With atomic technological atrocity
I find it very ironic that niggas try to rhyme behind me
The supersonic Def Squad MC
Get a bird's eye view
And don't miss the crispiest nigga in the nucleus
With futuristic linguistics
Ballistics be twisted like physics (word up)
Niggas be like how you come up wit this shit
But it's automatic, I'm inorganic
With the ability to travel nine planets
Niggas can't understand it
Please, I spark the brain of too many MCs
I be more than gladly to take your G's
We could battle for car keys and car titles
House deeds and bank accounts to make it final
I got what you need
The most homicidal words to come out of a human being
Mind state sick like Idi Amin

You can do what ya got to and say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside with gun play anyway
So I play the game and let the ball bounce where it may
And roll with Def Squad and L.O.D. everyday
You can do what ya got to and say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside wit gun play anyway
So I play the game and let the ball bounce where it may
And roll with Def Squad and L.O.D. everyday

Abracadabra talk shit I'll reach right out and grab ya
The hype got you like gimme, don't let it have ya
I'll knock you skeezers pleasers black like Jesus
Never lost in the jungle, navigators with Caesars
Instead, dare iz a dark side said by Red
I'm consciously, cruciously coming for your head
I'm from a small coast called Stay Out My Path
And from a big city called Foot Up in Your Ass
Jeepers, weepers, peepers, get snuffed
By the sneakiest, throughout the speakers like fisticuffs
Who the fuck is this paging me?
Oh, it's my creepy, greepy, grimy
Rough rhyme, crime-y Reggie
I'm saying, fuck who, went where, when, why and how
Get my shit to me not now but right now
Lucky niggas went platinum thinkin' they can see us
We swoop down on crews like angels on dust
I'll leave your mental so broke you can't pay attention
When I get inside your head
And take your brain to another dimension
I'm itching for a scratch and somebody to try to match
The battle cats who constantly be on it like that
The doom has dawned in
We knockin' niggas out without warning and pissing on them
The configuration is brain cell-wastin'
Renegades of funk like Afrika Bambataa and the Zulu Nation
You facin' a maniac, pacing over the track
Constantly bringing drama like Jason
In fact, I'm L.O.D.ing it on go planet Def Squad
Puttin' it down play for play like Ahmad Rashad
For the cause, I'm wiring jaws
Got niggas eating four-course meals out of KrazySstraws
And if it ain't def it ain't shit
I'm taking it to the limit and killing it each and every minute
Cause Keith Murray takes the beef a major step higher
And peacemakers will get caught in the cross fire
Hip-hop's filled with backstabbers, blunt grabbers
Cats with dirty claws, dogs with filthy paws
Then you got rap artists, claimin' to be the hardest
Bust them in their shit and they're quick to press charges
Spot rushers, block busters (word up)
Rockin' diamond clusters (ugh)
Comin' to stick the rich out you motherfuckers (yeah, yeah)
Educated black man on premises
L.O.D. and Def Squad forever, archnemesis
And remember this

You can do what ya got to and say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside wit gun play anyway
So I play the game and let the ball bounce where it may
And roll with Def Squad and L.O.D. everyday (Err-day)

Get up close and personally snatch your body
Often say, place your life status see on crtically

Call our business lines tryin na sound all fuckin hard
When your man dialed the number, heard my voice, jumped on my dick

Then tried to kick a little bullshit rhyme or two
About how much money you can make and how much damage you can do
But the simple fact is that you wanna be me
Redman, Erick Sermon, and the L.O.D
But the next time you wanna be me look in the mirror
The next time you leave a voice mail speak clearer
Fun loving criminal, savage mic killer
Comes through by way of knockout on the strength of my niggas

Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)
Momma wasn't rich (unh uh) my dady was poor (uh huh)
I couldn't take no more (I had to get my hustle on)

Growin' up I ain't never had nothin'
Had to get out in the streets and get myself somethin', feel me
Chillin' wit the Legion of Doom at an early age
Watchin' all the older niggas in the hood get paid
Yo I knew I could get it if I wanted to
Cause I lived on the corner where all the base heads came through
So it was only write that I get me just do B
Shit, I ain't choose hustlin', hustlin' chose me
This my block, I live here I sell drugs here
Let a nigga come through and slit my throat
I dare I swear, I got the tre eight in the tree
And the guage is right over there! Where?
In the bushes for you douches with one eye out
A nigga keep lookin'
For the police and them base heads juxin'
Shit, I looked for a job, but that ain't last long
I couldn't take it any more
I had to get my hustle on


Now I'm addicted to Carlton Ave servin' the hood
My basketball coach told my moms and that ain't good
I'd hide when she slide through every chance I could
She said ""Boy I see you tryin' to get back over in them woods
Wher u get the new sneakers from I know I ain bought 'em""
I told her ""Freeport mall, my uncle Tejuan bought 'em""
I grew up around hustlers, she knew I'd try it
She asked me was I doin' it you know I denied it
But I was tired
I wanted what I wanted when I wanted it
Fuck the consequeces I knew just how get
Cop that, cook that, chop that, pitch that
Save that, get stacks, fresh kicks, new hat
Carhartt, new boots, more smoke, more loot
Have crack, get dough, just like rap
Baseheads came back for the hit
My neighbors lookin' cause of the traffic
Man, but fuck that shit

Maybe my grandson might be wild like Charles Manson

Been blastin' niggas way before the remix ""I shot ya""

He rolled a seven

I'll kill your fuckin' ass and for your crew I'll do ditto
Kel-Vicious:
I'll leave a nigga dead, and stinkin' take his soul
Cha-boom, cha-boom fill him up with holes

Like the West coast say, I'm bout the ?macolay?
Niggas be slippin when I be flippin and I'll see you next trip
Cause revenge is a motherfucker payback is a bitch
Especially when I'm comin in with that Def Squad click
Can you relate to an intense, motherfucker
Gridiron mic cuffer, terror to the jugular
Smother all the others, punk motherfuckers
But I'mma keep it real, cause me and you is brothers
It'll happen so fast boy you won't stand a chance
Cause the L.O.D. put in work like red ants
And when I walk by Curtis Mayfield the draft
And spell the full limp love is just like Shaft
Shit I craft, is harder than Chinese math
Plus I lay you down for standing on Dangerous Ground

Let's embark on this mission like Black Indiana Jones
Is eatin Pookie sandwiches and smokin chronic bones
See I kill it a little, then leave it alone
Let my man 50 G drag it into his zone

Now 50 Grand's in the room and Legion of Doom
And if you sayin Def Squad's the bomb then I'll assume
It's takes brain splittin compositions, makin incisions
Dranin the blood up out silly niggas, like morticians

Now I'mma mack out and pimp the rhythm like Too $hort and Dru Down
And wait for what go around to come around
And beat it in the head with this, send em off into the unknown
In and out of conciousness, kind of like
A hip-hop microphone hypnotic
Specialist in gettin inside artists, sick word analyst
World's most foul freestylist
C'mon man y'all niggas know y'all can't get with this

Etchin and Sketchin, speakin with my hands like Terminator X and
Scheme and get choked out like Radio Raheem
My team'll put you to sleep and let you dream
I'm not down with the East West coast controversy
Me say you you say me, across the country makin millis
I'll be glad to see a brother get paid for hard work
But instead y'all steady tryin to ditch up the dirt

Yeah niggas still tryin to toss salt in the game
And y'all done read my name graffitied in the walls of fame
Let me explain niggas die for fame in this game my name's
Like a migraine, rappers get banged out the frame
See some funny style niggas in the house tonight
With posses too thin to win, and too light to fight

Enter the center like a big bread winner
So L.O.D. can eat that ass up for dinner
I come with high potent deadly quotin'

Niggas pullin' stunts like Jackie Chan
Not knowin' that they fuckin' with the demolition man

Pump, pump (don't sleep) but peace to Queens

Now heere we go again soundin' crazy but it's contagious
The sickest entertainer puttin' your brain though strainers
We smokes the choc', don't be afraid of the dark
Mentals get hit brain cells spark
Rappers swear they got the dopest jam on the shelf
But they don't believe that shit they own goddamn self
Last year I was underrated but I stay dedicated
I'm so dedicated I close my eyes I'm incarerated
Niggas was amazed at the shit you was kickin'
But all you did was adobo the chicken
I""m taking over like the psychic network
I got the drop on all you niggas out there claimin' that you do dirt
But the truth hurts and it kills you to listen
Like the sound of hollow point tip bullets whistlin'
Every little breath you take
Every little gesture you make
Every little jack you fake
I be the expert mic gladiator
Pop shit on records I'll cut your fingers off later

Verse 3:
Pump the new smash platium single the thug star spangled banner
Illustratin' grammer in a hostile manner
Texas chainsaw cuts hard to the core
Makin' sure they don't try to battle me no more
You seem to believe all you need is a rhyme and a dream
To defeat the all time great microphone supreme
But wake up cuz you playin' with the game of death
I'll smoke your body ashes in a blunt and leave no evidence left
Straight ashes ashes, dust to dust
I got you in my clutch there's nothing further more to discuss
And it's scary though when the eeriest voice on the radio
Is in your hometown doin' the show
With the technique that I'm usin' choosin'
Abusin'
Got more flow than D'Angelo crusin'
With poisonous venom Oh my God I get in em'

With more devastation than a nigga can withstand
Remember me? Untouched by any emcee
I add verbal assault to your mental injury
Cause I'm the vogit, toat it, quote it
Five-0 said freeze, man I blowed it
Rhyme strategies, no one's bad as this

Anywhere that I went yo I didn't know how to act

When all I really wanted to do was rap (1,2 y'all)
I've been preparing for this moment for years so step back

But fans say wack rappers shouldn't come my way
But I say
I destroy crews like an AK
Well OK please explain why you talk this way
Cause you can sell a million records and be wack (word up)
You can have mad skills and don't sell jack
It got my brain racin', heart pacin', fightin' incarceration

In front of the judge with a grudge and no budge

You ask Joe you sad as John Doe
You can fool some heads but the real niggas know (word up)

And it ain't no mystery people know the history behind me
And if you don't ask somebody on the street
But Murray never worry the girls love me very
Make a hit record quick fast in a hurry
Total captivation domination with conversation
That'll be talked about by the younger generation
Remedial MCs will always implement violence

Zonin on cloud nineteen as the Def Squad takes you
On another eerie place... of a dark side
Yesssss!!!

I escape from the world
To show niggas that my style is superb
For what it's worth I'm gettin off planet Earth
But I gotta redefine gravity first
So I figure, I get my guns and I bust the biggest cap
From the demand of the trigger
I'm equipped to dip with a knapsack
And a survival kit, with blunts n shit (word!)
I'm in all black, ?with a face? money
Wanna double to NASA, to hijack a space shuttle
More ages than curiosity
I enter the backdoor with animosity (""Yeah, here's Murray!"")
Searchin for the astronauts, checkin my watch
Determined the time I had to be out
I saw my prey without a second delay
Suited up, strapped down, straight and on my way
For five seconds to liftoff I was in the Hell
When I escaped from the world
I escaped from the world (4X)
So far...
I went through a Milky Way of stars
And landed on my destination, which was Mars (whoa, shit!)
This planet was foreign and new
As I'm puffin on a blunt, observin the view
To my surprise, a spaceship arrived
Out came a Martian, with six fingers and three eyes
He spoke a bleeky type of dialect (""Bleek, bleek bleek bleek bleek bleek"")
But understood my form of intellect
I said, ""I'm Keith Murray from the planet Earth
Boy I'm psychosomatic and homicidal with a verse""
My hypercritical form of words busts his brains
And then the whole atmosphere changed (""What the fuck?"")
	rrarahrhagharhar rharhagahgahrahgh
I was surrounded by some Martians in the hut about to front
I used my last resort, and pulled out the Blunts
Lit it, got the whole Martian crew blitted
So now's my chance to try to get acquitted
I said, ""I escaped from the planet Earth
To let my mind untwirl because I'm mad at the world
And the murder wasn't premeditated
My language was just mis-interpretated""
One acknowledge I'm right and pulled out the peace pipe
Aight?  About to set the vibes right
He lit it with his finger, I smelled the Martian buddha linger
I felt good cause I released some anger
No sooner than the cease of the herb ignite
I was headed back to Earth at the speed of light
Upon my return niggas thought I was in jail
Nah kids... I escaped from the world

As we zone, on the cosmic type of funk
(escapism y'all)
We drop mad flows, for the 1990's

There's no incidental of influential
Over instrumental, flow quintessential
You too paradoxical, anti-logical
Kid, I'll spontaneous combust you
Not only will I throw you under the bus, soldier
But I'll back up and run your stank ass over
Cause you exaggerated, falsificated
Testimonials will not be tolerated
My hip-hop melodies cruise like Penelope
And stay with you forever, like violent felonies
Metaphor entrepreneur, more raw like ""Kick in the Door""
Got the D's wondering what the dog saw
So whores, drop your drawers when we on tours
I come once a year like Santa Claus

And bust some to keep me uplifted
It flows to my braincells like from smoke
I'm no joke, I make an old man croak because I'm loc'
I'm wild, psychosomatic
I got gats stored in my attic, for any crazy bastard
It's all in the mind when the E drops a rhyme
My freakin frame is like a pair of Calvin Klein's
I drop flows through Customs
And get sniffed out like I stole somethin when I'm bustin
I'm Don of mic with this shit
I rock on to the breaker one-nine ya dig??
Erick Sermon got funk for day
For those who wanna backstab me in the back, like the O'Jays!
Can't get these nuts on the real
It's gonna be a cold day in Hell before the E drops the steel! (ARRRRRRRRGH!)
I still rock with My Adidas
With Run-D.M.C. and Jay, my niggas packin heaters
So get off, get off, and if you want the real scoop
On the E Double, check the sounds!
I rise my eyes burnt like cherry
Get wise to my style more fly than Halle Berry
I don't know so I'm sayin bye-bye
Until next try
Def Squad, is in the house, yo
Green Beret, is in the house, yo

For mad niggas it's curtains
I'm losin my mind in this biological universe
In my dreams I'll be gettin away drivin a hearse
So when I get to Hell, I'm stabbin up the Devil first
And leavin the skull decapitate his ass catchin wreck
Rip off his head and shit down his fuckin neck
From the little voice in my concious
I might just leave a crazy-ass unconcious
And Y, is a crooked letter like my alibi
A psychic couldn't tell the science of my mind
It's me against the world so y'all can all eat shit and die
'Cause I'ma gets mines, bitch!

'Cause when I come down I cold wreck the whole shit
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal I fades em all
And any nigga that step up, he's sure to fall
Now I come down to be the illest, the realest
Any nigga that step up, I'm ready to peal his
Cap, sit back relax and dwell on the shit
'Cause I be the illest little kid I'm ready to rip
On any motherfucker that wanna step nigga
I'll let you know where the weapon is kept, how the fuck you figure
That you can fuck with me, I be the illest B.G
Busting from Philly, chillin up in Cali
Sally from the Valley fucked me and she burned me
So you know I got the illest and I earned my props B
Fo sho' I'm ready to rip any MC who step
And let them know where the weapon is kept

Danger,The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World,1994.0,"Intro:
It's gonna be that, it's gonna be that shit
Hook:
Lounge homeboy you in the danger zone (x8)
Verse 1:
Keith Murray is this mic psychosis
I break your best rapper off thousands of pieces
I'm on some other shit, splittin' wigs with my penmanship
Kickin' flows harder then the music
So feel in your head and chest then pass it to the next
They give it 5 mic checks and all due respect
So please fill it up and check the antifreeze
Cause this nigga Keith drop mad degrees
I launch tomahawk missiles when I talk
With promiscuous intelligence like Mr. Roarke
From New York into the world over
I walk MC's like Jesus walked on water
As my airy frequency reigns through the galaxy
I easily gets busy in phase 3
I'm the nicest MC on this side of the peninsula
Stalkin' the perimeter like a ninja
Hook
Verse 2:
The Def Squad MC's is shitters
On your neuro transmitters
None quitters, none forgetters
Runnin' deep like rivers (word 'em up) what is
My delivers, which is, givin' crews the shivers
I'm like a mad scientist with this son
I concoct some shit that'll bust the sun
I got the stunky funky illest funk flow
For the glamorous scandalous world of radio
So how you want it, head crack, trips or ceelo?
I gets root deep like cavity creeps
Rockin' motherfuckers directly to sleep
A tybarrious rebel without a pause
For the cause and no clause, style is the son of noise
Peace to the hardcore, the outlaw raw
Bug, young blood thugs, smoke a ounce a day to 64 ounce jugs
In the realms of the danger
Hook
Verse 3:
Bust the contrast and how I forecast
Supersonic hyper phonic goin' on that ass paragraph
With the million dollar bionic metaphorical lyrical math
Generating off the chronic
By cooling in the dark path and the drug wrath of the ath
And the ill shit that I craft
It's labeled as sick logic to the critics on the didicks
But they don't know the half of the half
The apparatus status of my madness is
I conjure up a new style puffin' ganja, over the hook
Causin' more trauma with my mouth then the stealth bomber
Killing every style in the book
Like it's goin' outta style tomorrow
My style is coming from down south and cross yonder
I drop the dope shit for masses of non-believers
Like spiral passes to butter finger wide receivers
As my photo type sound gays leis and hoes my style probe
To the farthest reaches of the globe
Payin' dues got me cockin' tools, you fuckin' fools
I'm rippin' crew and no exception to the the god damn rules
This is danger

Bad Day,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"Yo shit is real dog, you know?
Stay out the web, cuz once you get caught up in the web
That's it, you know?
They get you they got you good
Yo do the knowledge, take notice, stay focused
Shit is real, and it's real hard out there, for a black nigga

Ayo the way they doin me I can't stand it
Branded as a social bandit, but I'm a man and I'ma handle it
I'm not the first and I won't be the last
Just look how they did Pac and Tyson in the past
Yo at times, sometimes, I feel like I'm cursed
Because my life done went from bad to worse
Through all the stressful moments and all of the worry
I'ma still remain the same Keith Murray
Because I know deep in my heart God is on my side
If I gotta do my time, then I'ma do my time
They label you wrong, when you try to do right
And then they wonder why a con is so uptight
I'm just livin proof, of when you livin the truth
I been goin through bad times, since I was a youth
Now look, they got me locked in jail
People wonderin will I prevail or fail
But only time will tell

My mind, just now and then
Lookin down the corridors and wonders what might have been
It was a bad day

Yo, I wouldn't even stand here and lie to you, yeah it's true
All the shit that you hear about I'm goin through
And we good people at heart Jesus knows that we try
So I wonder why we get a break no time
My little sister just died, and the judge let me fry
And now I gotta kiss my lil daughter goodbye
All the pressure, make me wanna grab the tech off the dresser
But understand that don't make you a man
So I address the, situation best way that I can
With a letter to the senator, from the lyrical political prisoner
That the system label a sinister
In jail while I confess my sins to the minister
It's enough to make a nigga go A-Wall
But for now I leave it in the hands of the Lord
It's a real situation we all go through
You know, unfortunately, Today was a bad day
Word, recognize, I'm no different from you
You no different from me, you know
It was a bad day

No slack for the rapper, no rest for the worried
Now everybody in the world heard of Keith Murray
When the hype dies down and reality sets in
We all goin through the same thing for a friend
And it ain't nothin good in the hood
Your own people will stab you in the back
Set you up and get you good
From the start, I came from the heart
Giuliani got the nerve to oppose the million youth march
They confiscated my passport, though I might of boated
I'm young black and dangerous that's why I got railroaded
And magazines, as if it's been misquoted, let it be noted
They can't break me to the streets I'm forever devoted
Yo
I'm tellin you man, this is life, you gotta live this life
Would you fall, would you make it, you never know
Today was a bad day
Livin proof of the truth, locked the fuck up, on some bullshit
You know, you livin, right or wrong
It was a bad day
But yo keep your shit tight, cuz when the get you they get you good
I had a bad day
Yeah, I understand you had a bad day",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-bad-day-lyrics
Some Shit,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"""Yo, this shit right here, is some shit, some serious shit""

Yo, the fact that I'm down wit Def Squad's hard to determine
Till you see me hoppin out the Coupe wit E Sermon
Or hoppin out the Keith Murray Suburban
Or hoppin out the Lex Land wit Redman, wildin and cursin
My thought process is mysterious like the Lochness
My furious mindset is complex
Killin shit like a carniverous millitant prehistoric monster
Comin to stomp all over you hip-hop conference
Landed in an Unidentified Flying Object
Turn you into an unidentified frying carcus
The smell of raw flesh make you nauseous
Acidest arsonist, burnin your bones to carbon and phosphorus
My metaphors sting like after haircuts when
The alcohol is applied to the raw skin
So whoever wanna battle get blasted
Get your teeth enamel shattered, shitted on like Pampers
You had a bad bitch, I left the back twist
I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage
Dug her out all day, then changed my sperm DNA
Now she got nobody to blame
I been spittin raw, what the fuck you think I'm livin for
Throw me in jail, I'll do a prison tour
For wannabe hard niggas, insecure niggas
Wit they heads to big for they neck to support niggas
Three in the Squad plus me equal four members
An extra addition for any special force mission
Man listen

Ain't these niggas on some shit
Keith Murray, Canibus ain't no stoppin it uhh

Let me draw a brief description of what happened
I was rappin, niggas got the scrappin, guns got the clappin
Three-fifty-seven degrees I was separated
Have bullets deflected metal, bodies decapitated
GUSH!! a nigga got struck as I look
I caught the next guy runnin by wit the metal hook (BOO-AHH!!)
Blew his back open, blood gushed on my face
A bitch fainted cuz she seen I enjoyed the taste
The case is that I split your melon
And feed it to the jigga-boos wit fried chicken wings
I'm wildin for Long Island, I turned and took Charles Ferguson
And open fire on any trains now
You may never know who's in your shadow
You punk ass niggas just best stay shallow
And hollow, if you wanna live to see tomorrow
Cuz ain't no sun comin out tomorrow
Yo, I might do something y'all niggas might regret like
Blast you in your face and disregard your vest
I'm pissin and dissin off of recognition and niggas to listen
Just to let you pussies know how I'm livin
Cuz I Return like the Jedi, wit my dead eye
Leave niggas to die, peace to niggas up in Bed-Stuy
Oh-ah, this that type of shit that make them niggas wanna wet it
Word up, got me ready to set it

Seems I steps wit aggression
To any bitch who think they nice in this profession
What? what you think your wrecking?
I break your stlye down to little fragments
The pain is permanent, so spare yourself the embarassment
Buck-fifty 'cross the face
Followed by knife wounds to the chest for you attempt to retaliate
I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes
But Deja Vu got something for you stankin hoes
Studio gangsta bitches I diminish ideas of bringin beef
Before the thought even finishes
I wanna see red, blood from a chicken head
'For I wild the FUCK OUT like the Grateful Dead HA
This wild style must run in my genes
Because my sister's in the county
And my brother just came home from Green
I strike like the black widow, through the underground radio

Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
(How it's gon' be)
Def Squad gonna make you go ah - ooh ooh ah

I come on stomping mud holes in tracks like Timbaland
The producer and the booth, niggas so don't get cute
I come through in the coupe with the chopped off roof
Humiliate you then blast you in your birthday suit
You a small side order of apple cider
I'm a three hot's in a cot dungeon rider
My hardcore street team crash the party with Def Jam
And Incorporate +Murda+ like +Gotti+
How about in back of the yellow cab like Seinfeld
Chew you like little neck clams on half shells
I got a hypochondriac flow that get real ill
Get nautious to the beat, I spit sick at will
And the time has come and your shit is sour
You need to turn your flow up an hour
Give you a permanent lean, like the Pais Tower
With a hoes that will wet you down like a cold shower

Yo we got the shit on lock (uh huh)
Come through and blast the spot (yeah man)
And my name is the record, so check it, when I put it on record
Everybody say oh my goodness!
And my folks if you with me where you at? (yes sir)
If you love what I'm doing holla back (talk to me)
And when I step on the scene, a lean mean wrecking machine
Everybody scream oh my goodness!

And yeah I hear you talking motherfucker write the check
And if you in the house then protect your neck
I'm 'Mister See You Anywhere It's Gon' Be A Showdown'
So ya'll better have lyrics when I come 'round
Cause I ain't lost a battle since God knows when
Some niggas tried to front but they gots no win
Taught how to prevent to lose and handle the win
Like birds are made to fly and fish made to swim
Wait a minute homie you don't really know me homie
I'll take you to a picnic boy you lunch meat
With my dazzling appearance and my world wide clearance
I am treacherous, inferio, impermanent, impetuous
I rock like an archeologist
Draw a picture like a forensic artist, perform like a dramatist
I'm fabulously wicked, miraculous
Rustic, majestic, ridiculous, oh my goodness


Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
Def Squad gon' make you go ah - ooh ooh ah
Oh my goodness!
Keith Murray gon' make you go uh - uh uh uh
Def Squad gon' make you go ah - ooh ooh ah

So when I see you I'm a pop your top like a cork
I pack flow like ammo, spit like camels
Come through and bless your whole crew like (achoo)
But some still wanna holla, pop they collar
Fucking with me like I run a funeral parlor
Linguist lyricist out for +Chips+ like +Estrada+
Bilingual emcees even couldn't even couldn't do me nada
With this mic I'm handy, flows be dandy
It's a +Full Moon+ and hoes wanna fuck like +Brandy+
Yeah I've been hated on, you probably heard it
And I kicked their little ass but them niggas deserved it
And I'm still in the hood and I still rep the hood
Still +Tee'ing Off+ for a +Long Green+ like +Tiger Woods+
I ain't even gotta say it, ya'll know when it's hot
So ya'll go back up in the vocal box

Up it's the cold blooded sin. Strictly murder. Legion of Doom 94. Word 'em
Up this is how we do that shit. Techs to your record son. Shit. Fuck that
Shit. Word 'em up that how we're always been

Yo check it, I feel the vibe like Shanet
Collaborate on niggas brains and bend you ass like a Sinse'
My death sentence is danger
I black out like Joe Ripken niggas hittin' the floor like the chamber
The sick authorist transmits for no repent
And activate the plan the Pentagon intelligence
So listen close like musical chairs
The L.O.D. is deep then the niggas Under The Stairs
I crack million dollar script like an architect
And execute like the chair when I inflict death
I got the creepiest slang in this galaxy
And wreck the industry so mysteriously
Coming with the funk from beneath I creep straight for jugglers
And twist rap caps for all you motherfuckers
Walk the bloody streets with 19 shots in the lueger
Niggas be scared to face 50 Grand like Medusa
The shit I produce is like gin and juice when it blend
Scenes from Toni Braxton you'll Never Breath Again
I rhyme without ability to reason, niggas is guilty of treason
Who's to blame but the Legion to the Doom

With punk niggas we got beef so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)
On the mic we definitely got beats so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)

Roy Jay go the wickedest mystic majestic flow
From a homicidal clique, Yo E make that psychopathic mix
I hits for the hecks or the shit that causes conflict in the script
Beeotch my style set on fire to touch Venus
My soul seeks the universe while I'm sleepin'
I'm creepin' makin' myself develop with the chronic
Electronic Million Dollar Man the mic bionic
So you can feel it in your nerves when I blast off into the suburbs
Conduct like ? with electrofying words
I freak to them suicidal tracks break backs
Niggas scarred fakin' fuckin' heart atttacks
Oooh when I'm comin' through the crowd
Niggas want static yo I got the gun pazoow, wizoow, word up

I got the slaughter for your brains drive you insane
Fuck that shit


The moderation incubation of my creation
Is instantaneously with my vocabulation accumulation
Trust me as I bust thee, lyrical homicidal shit from Keith Murray
If I had 24 hours to live and one wish
I wouldn't wish for no damn lifesavers
I'd start going wild like Larry Davis
The funk speech vigilante from the L.O.D
Gets funky freakly and freaky fluently
And deep as Greek mythology on level Z
There's six million ways to die
And eight million stories in the naked city and all them shits are lies
So I keep my wittiest ironist hideous
Psychosis bloodiest flow Thucydides
Comin' from out this orbit deep space 9's wiggle my shit
Meltin' crew down like synthetic acid
Come half steppin' fession' through a section
And get the midsection of your brain drain
With mad man expression, no question and no second guessin'

Yo 40 dreams and blunts for witches. Yeah that's what we got for them
Niggas. Yo lets get on it get off it. L.O.D. we won't forfeit
A-yo check it out. L.O.D. is the niggas man. A-yo put your money where your
Mouth is at nigga yeah. I have you rockin' dazie dukes and Reebok pumps

Da Ba Dunk Song,He’s Keith Murray,2003.0,"You know I had to go there right, that's water baby
Ay yo shorty got the badonkadonk, look right
Hangin of the edge of dat Kawasaki bike
See em in da streets at work rump galore
They be in salons, restaurants and stores
They come in all shapes sizes, fashions and colors
It might be your sister, aunts or your mothers
Or your baby mama and they aunts and they cousins
They roam in droves of half a dozens
Now you may not have seen a lot and maybe you have
All you gotta do is hit up your local ave
Lookin at the female anatomy
I see what made little Richard Write, Good golly miss molly
Excuse me miss no disrespect miss (you drop somethin)
Sike but that thing is da beautifulist
I bet you hit the bathroom and light up a clip
Sit down and take one fat hit

We be spankin that ass pumpin it up
Girl you gotta a badunkadunk
No doubt, badunkadunk, badunkadunk
Break me off a chunk of that badunkadunk

I was on 45th chillin with my man Earl
When she walked by I started singin you gotta fatty girl
You know I'm right don't be rude
Its just a compliment stanky you should be say thank you
To the ladies in da street that ever shook my hand
And thanked me for representing that fat back
It a raised your antennaes and keep you on point
Gwedoe's be like yo she gotta badoinkadoink
Bro and godamn boy ooo it
Come equip with three D thongs and shake included
Although it's rated PG little boys can look
Little girls write about it in they diary book
They be on TV, T-shirts and pocket books
Attracts straight lace guys down to crooks
So if you ever seen one that ain't fat
Hit with an extra can of fixaflat

Ay yo Tina gotta badunkadunk, I know I told you I'd be true
But Tina gotta badunkadunk so I'm leavin you
Yo Leesa gotta badunkadunk, I know I told you I'd be true
But Leesa gotta badunkadunk so I'm leavin you",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-da-ba-dunk-song-lyrics

Hey yo, this goes out to my man
Adrissa ""Knockout"" Beauwright and Anthony ""Apple"" Ames
Word is bond
I'm talking to my peoples all across the land
Relate to the situation at hand
I know everybody done been in some shit
And ready to lay niggas to rest
Just proove it but check it
We done did it, seen it, done it, been through it
Swigged it, guzzled it, copped it, smuggled it
Rocked it, chopped it, locked it
Now we got the whole neighbourhood going through it
Ay yo, money in the hood makes the game go good
We only rock black jeans, black Timbs, and black hoods
Karl Kani wasn't even out, dressing fly
Rocking jams is what it was all about
We had dreams of doing shit niggas never heard of
Then damn my partner got murdered
CHORUS: (12)
(This goes out) To my mans
Hey yo, close the blinds when you cooking
My neighbours be looking
My nerves is shooken so fuck it I'm off to Brooklyn
To my cousin with the devilish grin, devilish way of livin
But fuck it, he's still chillin
Adrissa ""Knockout"" Beuwright druck 40s all night
While I did the mic something right
Catching wreck or we was playing ball
Getting busy in any little hole in the wall y'all
Street soldiers with good heads on our shoulders
Wanted to go to school to be doctors and lawyers
Well I got caught up in the system with two ounces
Had to do a little time in the big houses
Before I even knew it I felt it
Ay yo, yo your cousin Knockout got murdered, right?
Damn, that was my man
Ill keep holding on (2x)
I'm on the cutting edge cause I'm young and I'm black
Now I feel like I got a monkey on my back
But you know I'm stronger than that of course
I puff on El and stay mental just knockin em off
I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill
Listen to ym Squad members
Then we go for the kill
As I smell the vapors linger
I saw jealousy bring the anger in the chest with a banger
I'm on a rage against the machin, what I mean
I want to see my people
With more than just first of the month cream
The situation's always looking grim
Pregnant teenagers with kids and can't take care of em
For them niggas who did it, word to life
I'm a get with ya
Peace to my peoples, I'll never forget ya

When I Rap,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"Verse 1
When I rap competition perform disappearing acts
I jam suckers like Smuckers
My squad is funky like a six pack of motherfuckers
With conversation my creations will collide nations into confrontation
Competition couldn't stand a chance
I'll wear you out like if I had one pair of pants
Murray emphasizes cataract poetry meaning you blind bats can't see me
Throughout my career I rip year to year successfully
Dragging debris in my vicinity
My symbol is the sickle like the Grim Reaper
My style is the greatest invention since the speaker
A psychopath with a knife in my voice
The lyrical homicidal madman is top choice
The scene I scope it first because I'm homophobic
And then I 
rope-a-dope
 it
And dominate the cypher bloody red
Coming out my head leaving rappers brain dead
I come through like POW! and BAM!
Reppin' like the lyrical version of Shazaam (Damn!....)
When I rap
Chorus(2x)
 Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
 Believe what I say!
 When I rap
Verse 2
When I rap, one hand can't clap
So lets squash the beef, cook it, and we all can get fat
Try to swallow a line and you'll find
I'm one hard act to follow wallow in my vibe
Swallow and your throat will explode
Sending you through schizophrenic episodes
My style is so well off on it's own
I leave it unattended and go see my dog about a bone
When I'm the microphone ( When I rap )
And biting niggas will leave it alone
I go together with the rhythm like a sentence and some verbs
And herbs so check out every word
I kicked a verse for Father Time
He put the world on pause cause I fucked his head up with a rhyme
Diamond studded rough and rugged fuck it
There's nothing left for you to do now
 but 
kick the bucket
Dummy who's ever flipping
It better be a round-off back hand-spring arabian summy
With more concentration then an acrobat
When I rap
Chorus
Verse 3
When I kick the gift of gab and I'm grim and I'll be god damned
If any mortal or immortal man can withstand
And not slam my jams cause I take them on a trip
And flip the script with legit manuscripts
Fogging up the mic with real legit compounds
Mass mic Murray man flurries in the bound
Oh what the fuck you fall and can't get up when I erupt
So pass the buck cause you've been struck
With the will I learn will I burn
Off carbon dioxide cause I'm on the flip side
Word conducter emcee destructer
Millions be saying ""That Murray's a motherfucker!""
I dip and dive punch you in your eye
In a battle if you try to lie in your rhymes when we socialize
I'm beating Mother Nature down to her knees
While making more papers than trees
You can't be serious that's impossible
I leave niggas laid up in the hospital
Bandaged from head to toe and hat
My shit is intact when I rap

Child of the Streets,He’s Keith Murray,2003.0,"Yo, 
the fruit don't fall far from the tree
Yeah, uh
 (Keith Murray)
My grandfather use to tell me
This place ain't got nothing to offer you
Don't you see all the changes everybody going through
This family got problems and they do too
But everybody wanna tell you what they think you should do
He said watch them so called friends and them girls too
Sonny do you like they did Jesus crucify you
As he sat there in his chair looking out the window
I'm thinking when you can't get away where do you go?
(Inside your mind) man child never had a chance to be young
Either you selling drugs or out there on the binge strung for some
There's only two places to go the morgue or the Pen
For some school is an option entertainment to alternate them
Then they'll try to exploit you discriminate you
Use you as a tool make money and live in luxury off you
And we so confused we wanna believe in something
So they promise us the world but give us nothing
 (Sonji Mickey)
I say we can be all in this together
Yeah, will you end up like, your family tree
Tell me what you gonna do what you gonna do
What you gonna do
Your mind ain't too far from the sky
 (Keith Murray)
The death of a loved one remind you of yourself don't it?
Knowing you could be next at any given moment
Like Twine I used to call him a brother of mine
His pops was a drunk and his mother was blind
He use to stay at my hose sometimes my moms didn't mind
We was just nickel and dime hustlers wasting time
Living in the streets targeted and forced to kill
Dualistically we learned how to lie and steal
Gangsters of the future modern days thugs
Seem like my childhood is covered in blood
Traveling a rough life in the eye of the storm
Now I wear their life stories tattooed on my arm
Psyc's grandmother passed away on April fools day
Then her funeral was on her birthday shit is real
My man had four baby moms and two on the way
And trying to make a living for them passes away in vain
God bless him, ask Skeeta
 (Sonji Mickey)
Child of the streets well, well, well, well
Will you end up like your family tree?
Tell me what you gonna do 3X
(Child of the streets, understand the habits
Behind the child of the streets)
 (Keith Murray)
They try to fuck my fame up tear my name up
Turn around and sue me fuck my little bit of change up
I knew it was going to be some shit to get me for some cream
I saw it in my subconscious world like a vision
At first it hurt me like a knife in the heart
But by nature I continued to live out my part
As art imitates life and life imitates art
Don't respect the streets and they tear your ass apart
It's important that my understanding understood
But it's more important that it's understood in the hood
And to all the females in the Pen stay strong
Any day in jail girl is a day too long
And for those who had to do what they did to slide
Now running like a fugitive to save the live you live
Put in a box saw my step pops
He said boy Keith what the blood clot how much time you got?
 (Sonji Mickey)
Child of the streets little sister
Tell me where will you lay your head?
Child of the streets little brother
Where will you make your bed?
Yall tell me what yall gonna do
What yall gonna do
Tell me what yall gonna do
Tell me",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-child-of-the-streets-lyrics
Slap Somebody,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"Intro:
I need a blunt fore I slap the shit out somebody
Uhh come on, get it up y'all
Uhh come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on get it up y'all
Uhh yeah yeah uhh
I know y'all like this one
Uhh, uhh, yeah, yeah, uhh come on
Yo, y'all niggas will never see my level
Raps so hot I slapbox with the devil
Tap a jaw, slap a bitch, do what I like
Gotta sociology of money like Reverend Ike
Yo here's a rapper fiction, get out the jurisdiction
Before I hit that ass with a cross-addiction crucifixion
Editorial newsflash
Extra extra, let this blast wit your stank ass
Face the ultimate challenge, style's gotta lotta mileage
Come to violence, leave in silence
This beat's a beat so come on take a swim
Emcees can't float don't worry about them
I'm a duke like Patty, ritz like Matty
Slick like a khaki, but not your baby daddy
Girls I got em locked, flavors come assorted
So pop that coochie girl like you're double-jointed, come on
Chorus:
This is for my thugs in the clubs and the hotties in the party
Who need a drink before you - SLAP SOMEBODY
All my cats on the corner who's packin a shotty
Who need a blunt before you - SLAP SOMEBODY
Rewind this jam and let it rock the party
Before, I - SLAP SOMEBODY
I speak with more technique, than karate
Cos, I, will - SLAP SOMEBODY
Aiyo, strictly from the street that's why I get love
Erick darin niggas out in the back of the club
With the mic in my hand, just got paid
Take you suckers out til I get on stage
When the girls see my face and they all get excited
Thugs in the front row bout to start a riot
Too loud to be quiet, too wired to be tired
Yo E, crank this shit up and get it started
Get the crowd funky like the whole place parted
MC's rest in peace like dearly departed
Then it's all in together now, let me show you how
I do it rock 'n' roll style, then dive in the crowd
Murray ain't your average MC, I gotta lotta fame
But don't act conceited when you see me on the street
I hang with the rich, keep it real with the poor
Kick hard metaphor, cos that's what I'm here for
Catch me east of the sun or west of the moon
Lookin butter fly like a caterpillar just cocooned
Smooth like Thug Passion over-the-rocks
So sporty they need to put me on a Wheaties box
Chorus
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
In a special way to play on, baby play
The way you shake that ass girl is something drastic
FABULOUS, and, fantastic
Fly like a B-52
 hotstepper
Got latinos yellin ""WEUPA!!""""
Ese loco, dolli toto
Beseve culo, papi chulo
Whatever, the more the merrier, the longer the weed the scarier
My Squad is Def and we ain't hearin ya
Beat eaters think quick with the speed of a cheetah
Stripped down to my wife beater
Baby doll, shake what you got
I'm not a player hater, I just diss a lot
And don't slam the doors of da Maserati
Because, I, will, slap somebody
Chorus
Outro:
Bring me up somethin nice cold to drink in this bitch
Before, I - SLAP SOMEBODY
Fix me somethin hot to eat before I have to go out-
Side, and - SLAP SOMEBODY
Throw your hands in the air from side-to-side
Before, I - SLAP SOMEBODY
Doo, doo, slap slap
I, will slap - SLAP SOMEBODY
Slap me and I'mma slap you back......",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-slap-somebody-lyrics
Herb is Pumpin,The Most Beautifullest Thing in This World,1994,"I gets dumb with the momentum of the drum
And blow MC's, to kingdom come
""The future holds nothing else, but confrontation""
Murray is a lyric luna-tic toc
Boom, I fill the room with the rough rhymes I consume
My lyrics is too fly for this world (word em up yo)
And more famous than the Jheri Curls
My rhymes correspond with the funk beat
Like infrared corresponds with heat
I'm malicious and vicious, puttin rappers in stitches
(yeah yeah) when I'm rippin up twelve inches (like this)
My rap style is a metallic bastard
That thrives off of battery acid (word em up)
I rhyme like I'm hungry over funk beats
For those, who shit where they eat
Reach, and your strategies'll be picked off
Cream puff sweet, I freak the sheek type of speech
The vital, verbal combat I enlist
Wraps rappers' brains up into a pretzel twist (word em up)
When I'm coastin with the funk style potion
I leave your notion dead and bloody in the ocean
I can't be beat so don't be under that assumption
I flow as long as the herb is pumpin
""Yo what kind of weed is this?""
""It's the bom bom zee baby.""
""Yo this shit is WAY out!""
""Yo let's be outta here.""
Come and take a ride on my bad side
You can't fuck with my style cause it's bastardized
And when I meet my match, I'm tyin em up
In the bassline and stabbin em in the spine for tryin to play fly
We got to have it like some hungry dirty stinkin motherfuckers
Always actin wild and stupid like truckers
Goin against the grain, barbecuin' niggas
In the Purple Rain as my wild brain child style goin insane
And I'm wild with the usage of a harsh word
My style of speak is mentally disturbed
I drug the head more than hallucinogenics with rhymes like these
On the mic I'm catchy like herpes
Covalent ionically with the mic I combine
And gain more strength, than a molecule enzymes
E crack the sticks while I get in the mix
And kick some fix after prefix after predicates
I take a trip down memory lane
And kick some shit, that'll bust your brain
Hit as you should, a real common hood
Not Stephanie Mills, but I still feel good
I take a Phillie Blunt to go, and yo
I flow as long as the herb is pumpin",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-herb-is-pumpin-lyrics
Christina,He’s Keith Murray,2003.0,"I'm always getting shitted on son, ain't gonna be no, no different
Can you accept me as I am? I ask you
Always, the love lords? I need you
Can you open your heart to mine and accept me and all my faults
During the human course activity, watch me give me my room
I am radiant, give me my space, I am light

Yo, 2/27/98 I wrote a check out
To H.W. funeral home for my little sister Christina
15 years old damn man this fuckin world is so cold
8 months before I had to do three years
Coming from the air port my face burning with tears
I had this black cloud hovering over me
Far back as I can check back down my family tree
Its been with me since my first LP
2nd LP I was sittin in court
3rd LP I was trapped in the belly of the beast, got it back to the streets
By the power of the mind and positive of light
Some say livin is death and dying is life
I say pray for me that I should be born tonight
I remember roaming the streets in those cold winter nights
Look at me this is my life

Suddenly my life feels so alone, tell me what the hell is going on
Tell me, tell me, why my life feels so alone, so wrong
Tell me what the hell is going on
Help me, please help me

I can't even begin to explain the mental anguish
I went through as a child when I heard my pops had passed
I went to see him on the sick bed
With my grandmother, that day I knew it was the last
I loved him but I had to grow up without him
Over the years I've lived through frustrations and questions
In 90' I went to jail as an adolescent
Then in 92' my moms had to go back to the essence
Got me thinkin about the meaning of my existence (I lost my best friend)
I realised the devil was spying on my from a distance
He don't want me to receive my blessings he fear me
My family suffered more deaths then the Kennedy's
This is real and if you don't believe me ask someone that grew with me
Know them and feel my energy
Please never fabricated nor duplicated so I ask you
Can you open you hearts and minds and receive me with all my faults
Can you open your hearts and minds unconditionally to begin to understand my cause
Hey yo this world is a pool of sharks
But I'm the animal right when I stand up for myself and bark
And this year I gotta go all out for it
I've been hustlin for 13 years, nothin to show for it (I mean nothin)
Lookin over my bills damn they eaten me up
Entertainment task force watchin so what the fuck
I paid my taxes too fuck you and your uncle
The laws of nature will see me through
And yeah I peep it and naw it ain't no secret
How niggas give their word with no intentions to keep it
I'm givin you the roots of the real
My emotional feelings bi-polar is how I feel",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-christina-lyrics
My Life,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"I'ma take you back to day one, livin in this New York slum
It's deaf to the dumb, only break bread with some
Moms left at 15, had no American dreams
To this day, I'm sellin to my cousin who's a fiend
No one would got me but my older brother
Little did we know the dirt we did fell back on my mother
But didn't care back then, that's why she left like that
Now my parents became the street, and it's best like that

Some nights I pray to God and ask him to pull my cord
Cuz times is hard like the opposite street'll leave you scarred
Street wise with no respect for authority and shit
A chronic hustler of crack, a typical bitch
Raised by madu who strung out on a glass dick
But every now and then I blessed her with a hit
So she don't have to trick
It's prevalent amongst kids today
Hustle krills, stack dough, and everything's okay
HOOK
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (I gotta live)
It's the emancipation proclamation under the self devised guidelines
Of self preservation and starvation (and I gotta live)

My life in this world wasn't about diamonds and pearls
It was rough growin up around the boys and girls
After daddy left, shit was a mess, momma stressed
But I give her an award, cuz damn she tried her best
Holdin down the household, barely had money to fold
Christmas time, cherished our little shit like gold
I can't front, daddy was still there for me, cared for me
But him and mommy breakin up was like a nightmare to me

Yo this is for the younger fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers
Success is nothin if it ain't if it was with the others
We gotta make the best out of this terrible situation
If not for us, for the younger generation
We gotta break the chain, and deal with the pain
For all our people that was slayed in vain (revenge)
For all our peoples that was falsely framed (revenge)
For all our peoples that's livin the name
HOOK

Let me show, I gotta love L.O.D., they put me under the wing
And then I teamed up with the most beautiful thing
In the world, cuz L.O.D. we all we got
I'm a fans and my mans keep it like it or not
I know it hurts, havin to do everyday dirt
Police all over my back, feel like bustin them jerks
When I'm my road to the riches, I stay away from snitches
And them bitches, and keep my mind on business

Life was tough so I became aggressive like a pit
The only time I felt relaxed was when the blunt was lit
Thinkin me and my team can be tight like the gambino
Muscle in the hustle scene respected like Leno
It gets deeper than the words of Proverbs
New thoughts emerge, as I cop the squat on the curb
Thinkin the herb strengthen my brain like spinach
And heavy shine, flooded with ice might reduce my self spirts

Stick em, my life is so real it hurts
Like when I saw my pops bein driven off in a hearse
Like when I saw my mother bein driven off in a hearse
Like you school when the roach crawl out my shirt
Like on Thanksgiving when we got free food from the church
Back then it was DJ Red Alert and Kool Herc
Rockin been stripe knees and latigra shirts
Back then L.O.D. was puttin in work
From the cradle to the grave
We all in the struggle, we gon struggle, we gon strive to stay alive
All my real people know what I'm talkin about
Watch each other backs
Word up, my life is nothing without my niggas, word up",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-my-life-lyrics

I'm on my way to LaGaurdia
I'm on my way home or away, JFK (2x)
Hey yo, anywhere I go I definately reo for mine
Cause I'm constantly in a Def Squad state of mind
I went to New Orleans and kept it clean
Spitting, splitting rappers at they seams for the cream
By all means
Although I seen the green wasn't enough
I jumped in the Lexus, went to Texas, pulled a royal flush
Feelin like Tony Atlas, up in Dallas
Rhymacutin with them niggas who be shootin up in Houston
And do remember I get in ya in Virginia
Swept N.C. and S.C freeze the West Indies
Oh and I'm going back to Indiana and Alabama
Did the ink pad bounce through Atlanta
I be rapidly runnin through chocolate cities
Like Philly, D.C., Cincinnati, and M.D
And Jersey, Lord have mercy
Can't nobody serve me cause my world be free

Goin around the world, goin around the world
All around the world, goin around the world
Goin around the world cause my world be free
Goin around the world (3x)
Cause my world be free
Then I was touching ground Uptown
As my rings gleamed in Queens
As I cooked it up in Brooklyn for all the friends
Kentucky was lucky I had to much Hennessey
When I was representing love love Tenessee
Kansas City, Missouri can speak upon the glory
St. Louis can even tell the story
Of how I dropp shit thick and cold like the snow in Chicago
A major up in Ohio, I was pack with cactus tactics
Up in Phoenix, Arizona set shit on fire in Oklahoma
Niggas had their ears pinned to the ground listening
When I was stomping through Detroit, Michigan
You hear me sounding crispy looking all scandalous
Swervin in the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles
Don't even ask the question did I visit Africa
Shit I warmed it up in Alaska, smashed Nebraska
CHORUS (3x)
From interstate to tri-state to international
Mr. Keith Murray always keeps it classical
They had me up in England, mic stranglin
Jewels danglin while my single jingle jangling
Number one in my field, never defeated
Went to Sweden demonstrated malicious mic beatings
I was with my right hand man, Redman
When I did the Ichiban crane style in Japan
I transform like Dr. Bruce Banner
Stepped off the plane and blacked out up in Canada
I'm a million dollar man like Lee Majors
Fucked around and hit the jackpot up in Vegas

None of y'all niggas dont't know me
You crazy, punk ass nigga
Hiding behind the microphone
(Y'all ready for this)

Yo, you's a lying fronting fake ass thug everybody know it
You pussy and I'm just the one to show it
Word to everything I love and don't love
This nigga ran from me one night after the club y'all
And I'm very hard core I live out my metaphors
Don't ask me what happened just go ask that nigga jaw
I'll tear your roof off sucker punk motherfucker
I'll rush you, crush you, RIGHT?!
This is a constant reminder for you to keep shit straight
Stab you, throw you overboard faggot you dead weight
Rest in peace to all those who thought I wouldn't do it
Crack craniums is what you get for thinking stupid
The bomb bazee kid is back in the house
So all you punk niggas go back in the house
Violent as the bible, kill all my rivals
With the two piece with the scope on top sniper rifle

So stop trying to see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave accuse, it's a must you get bust
Were not to be fucked with toys ain't us

And y'all niggas ain't never hug no block like me
Sold working to fiends and hustlers and shook the d's
I ain't proud or bragging but it's plain to see
Ain't half of y'all pussy come up like me
I run in these streets from sun up to sun up
You the type to get found in the back of the club stabbed up
And with the hands you can't get none
So you little bitch niggas run for your guns

Some of them niggas gotta die to show the rest that shit is real
And you know how it's done son
They pop a lot of shit, then finger fuck the phone 911
Yeah, so duck me when you step in the place
Cause I'll spread that nose all over your face
Niggas always wanna try to talk it out too late
Hit you with the dirty 30 and crack your chest plate

Put the barrel in your mouth boom, blow your brains out

Catch you in the back retire you from running like Carl Lewis
And I ain't going back to jail, hell no
Put me in your mix I'm taking you to hell, lets go

Secret Indictment,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"Intro:
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
This is for only certain people (word up)
This is for all my peoples in the struggle
All my peoples in jail
All my peoples dyin' to live
Verse One:
On my way home alone I took the shoertcut through the danger zone
Ran into alligator looking Jerome
I jumped out the truck all drunk
Nuts hanging out the car like ""what?""
Nigga, I gives a fuck
He said ""what up"" I said ""what up""
He said ""I need to be up""
I went in my nuts hit him with a 100 yo
He gave me a glare with sparklin' gold teeth
And said
Yo Keith, your product is always peace
Yo son, you know I just got released
I was on the block and got bagged by pussy police
And they the reason why Calvin is deceased
The bullshit will never cease but dough is comin' at least
I gave him a pound and a hug
Told him ""hold it down thug""
Peace
I'm a fleece cuz its hotter than fish grease
We was high as a kite
Feelin' kinda petro
I metroed
My way back to the Montero
Before I even made it to the car door
I was rushed by 2 jakes
And then 2 more
So here wew are fightin' through all the excitement I ask
What you lockin' me up for?
One said Secret Indictment
Chorus: (2x)
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
The gates are locked
And you are trapped inside
Verse Two:
Starin' at the face of the judge
With the identical image of a true thug
I shoulda smuggled in a shotty (word up)
Cuz they tryin' to treat me like I killed somebody
And what the D.A. had to say
Wasn't justice in no kinda way
Under the doc number 284389
We the people recommend upstate time
I said your honor
I can't even see that far
That's when my lawyer started droppin' the repetoir
He said your honor
These allegations against my client are very undefient
Toward the contrary
The judge said
Mr. Murray didn't I tell you if you in my courtroom again
Your ass is gone a long time
Then he presumed
Plus your a member
Of the notorius gang
The Legion of Doom
He said look at me
Thought he shook me
I turn around and the bastard
Through the book at me
I hope this teaches you a lesson
A half a million dollar bail
Boom
This court is in session
Verse Three:
I reach the tear visions of pair
Remind me I'm locked up
So I got no chance but not to give a fuck
Check out my perspective as it dropped
A lock across ya chest
And bust ya snotbox
Technicalites make me wanna bust chops and cops
And murder flocks in all actualities
That's a necessity in my recipe
Plus it was a black cop that framed me
And if it ain't one thing
It's another ask my brother
Went in jail for one thing
Stayed in for another
So here I am frustrated
Sittin' in jail
Thinkin' bout all my unfinished business left in the world
I hopped on the jack connect with my connect
Told him what I was up against
Plus they found a Tech
Get the cash together
Put up the car and the house
We on the jail phone
So watch what come out ya mouth
In 24 hours I was out
But the situation's never ended
Cuz the case is pended
To be continued",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-secret-indictment-lyrics
Media,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"Intro:
Motherfucker. You motherfuckers!
Verse 1:
Keith Murray flips the undergroup cut dope funk flow chromotose
So listen close
I'm like the undertaker turning rappers into ghosts
Host and roast MC's like I'm suppose
I can send L.O.D. to bust caps perhaps
Bring E and Red and we can kick some raps
This track is so sickenin' and bouncin'
Make you nod your head so much you need counciling
I flow to a rough kind of mode
Competition run for cover cause I'm droppin' loads
No brainer crossing over in the Range Rover
Insainer pack heat like a super nova
Keith Murray gets it on and poppin'
Shut it down like administrative lockin'
Marble face poetry poverty hard
Perform like the ?
We went from allies to enemies
Stingin' like centipedes
Sit around and watch death come in threes
I burn like lye
Gruesome like Faces Of Death parts 1,2,3,4 and 5
Hook:
Everyday I got a new style hatchin'
This is more than rappin' this is media hyjackin'
""As long as I'm alive I'm a keep the vibe
24-7 365""- Redman (x2)
Verse 2:
I'm a leader without affair
Soldier without a past
Come around here frontin' and we gonna splash your ass
And you feelin' me you drillin' me with maximum intensity
Intentionally that's how it's suppose to be
Spectacular monster rap or slasher
At the nightfall I'm after ya like Blackula
I rap with a Blackenstein frame of mind
Aircraft fly when I use to push my braids to the side
Slide from Keith Jekyle to Murray Hyde
My battle cry make niggas wanna just lay down and die
It's imparitive that you feel the heritage I provide
Comin' courtesy but with no Jive
? freaka, conversatin' through frequent modulations out digital speakers
I make you give it all you got don't stop for a breather
Turn a rap aethesist into a Def Squad believer
Yo Keith Murray can't be touched
Plus girls jump in my flow like double dutch
What
Hook
Verse 3:
You went from a full course meal to a half chicken wing
Girl you gotta grow up if you wanna do your thing
You can't make me or break me but hate me greatly
Call me on my birthday to try to aggrivate me
Cause when I rock I got all the girls with me
Got niggas bouncin' off the wall like spider monkey
Bury the hatchet in the back of anybody tryin' to match it
It's the vulture new fulture gonna scratch it while you catch it
There's a hole in the bucket there lies a
Nigga dead and stinkin'
For sittin' around with his ass stinkin'
Flamboyant undunted most wanted
Those that don't understand it better get up on it God damn it
The life of the party order hits like John Gotti
But shhh that's on the low don't tell nobody
The scientist of the 
Jaw Jab
 do work in the lab
Test my experiments out on the ave
They got you thinkin' but they lyin' anyways
So when they gossipin' about us they got nothin' to say
Don't play
Hook

Yo, you know what it is (L.O.D.)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

Who the fuck, am I, fuel to the fire
You washed up niggas should be thrown in the dryer
And in due time I'll pull your cover
And then you'll suffer, you foul motherfucker
You baldheaded sucker, your body full of blubber
You only got here 'cause moms popped the rubber
I got your number, and I don't care who you get
My click is sick, y'all can all lay under
And nigga you old, I don't wanna go
To a all-time low with your kids screamin' (NO!)
You a liar, you're stingy and phony too
That's why your people in your own hood hate you
And niggas try to comb out my wig
I split 'em wide, it's all outdoors like zig-zag-zig
To whom it may be concernin', the crew is Def Squad
And I'm the Green Eyed Bandit, Erick Sermon

You know what it is (Def Squad)

And I just love when a nigga try to pop that shit
I dare a nigga ever try to challenge my intelligence
Your flow is irrelevant, I'm fresh, that's evident
My 360's sick, I call 'em Seabiscuit's
Check his vocabulary, listen to his flow
He sayin' things that I said seven years ago
And it ain't about how many niggas you got
It's about who drove first and who get popped
I'm a chip off the old block, hip off the old hop
Clip out the gold Glock, pimp out the whole spot
Sell out the whole stock - stop sleepin' on me
Motherfuckers, wake up, last stop
And I don't play games, y'all dudes is Tetris
I'll kill MC's over Instant Message
I got it, I'll front it, you want it, come and get it
You know I don't care, I'm with it, 'cause I live it

You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (Gilla House)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

Yo, I'll rock backyard to backyard
A fat broad to the snack bar
I'll shut down another rap star
My arm like Terry Bradshaw
Out in Cali they jungle talk like Madagascar
Redman raw, still here nigga
More Fresh than the Prince in Bel-Air nigga
Like O.D.B. I take welfare nigga
Rob the mailman, shit, hell yeah nigga
The strong move silent, laws to adopt to
But in Brick City, the silent get shot too
You gonna stop who? It's Redman
I plan to stick around like a Spiderman costume
L.O.D., somebody woke the ape up
So I'ma ride for 2 Tek and A-Plus
Def Squad niggas whoop yo' ass
Fuck a punchline, my shit is hook and jab
Bitch!

You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

We, got, that, funk
Murray's, packed, with funk (you need to know)
We, got, the funk for yo' ass (let's go)

Yo, a lot of rappers holler tough stuff, they don't live it
When you hear me emceein I'm speakin from experience
Keynote speaker, Rock funk freaker
This lecture is conducted from the mic and through the speaker
Now who gets weaker, not this dunn
Look I'm never shook down even when, I was on the run
I'm A REBEL! I love REBEL PEOPLE!
You're not equal, you damn creep you
I, wake up in the morning with my game face ON
And play hard all day - WORD IS BOND
By the way whatever happened to - WORD IS BOND?
The brother Ak lied to me during RAMADAN
I'm takin no prisoners, takin no shorts
Still drink Olde E, cans 40's and quarts
With creativity, and original thought
And a twist of fate I twist your face, don't get caught

Yo, we got the ghetto funk, you need to know
Where the funk is at, funk dat bump that
Murray's back with that
Funk to make a person catch a heart attack (he's baaaack!)
Yo, we got the ghetto funk, you need to know
Where the funk is at, funk dat bump that
Murray's back with that
Funk to make a person catch a heart attack (you need to know)

We, got, funk, for, y'all, stank, ass, C'MON!
Yo - here's, what I'mma do for you
Choke you out 'til your lips and your face turn blue
OOPS! Now look what you done made me do
I, did it again - and the joke's on you
I'm more than official reputable undisputable
Lyrical phrasologist (you know how I do)
Not one of you or any combination of you
Can ever mess around (boy you know how I do)
Dialectical linguist, unlimited thinker
Descriptive mental photographer
L.O.D. and P.P.P. gets it on
We strong to cause bodily harm to King Kong
Stock lock and barrel, empty, reload whoa
This funk here, Glocks up, c'mon
I'm not an R&B pop star rock'n'roller
I'm a underground rapper with a chip on my shoulder
You mindless, spineless, jellyfish I eat MC's..
.. which is my favorite dish
I sailed the seven seas, pack 'em in like sardines
And eat fruit right off the stress tree
Keith kill beef like Mad Cow Disease
Spazz on me? NEGRO!
Some say I'm sarcastic, with a bad reputation
But ignore 'em, don't listen, they Mr. Murray hatin


This is to my, negroids, spaniels and caucasoids
Even chisel-faced, hardcore, rap b-boys
With my high wire, tightrope, trampoline STYLE
Tear your ass up, with service and a SMILE
I'm the, local hero, global player
Make your grandmother get up and do the Murray rainer
Grab you goin to a death row, like an alligator
Good God, my Squad got too much flavor
Rainbow style like a pack of Now or Laters
This funk shit gon' shake the equator
My, Squad, stay true to the game
We the trillest mother-effers this side of the grave

The Carnage,He’s Keith Murray,2003.0,"Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morninh
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo the streets is hungry - word
Its time to eat, most definitely
Grab ya plate
Get your knifes and your forks yea
Keith Murray Get ready
Yo, as I look out at the high rise
And write about my life into the sunrise
Looking at the smoke where the twin towers stood
Forty blocks away forty stories high I could see it good but we
Been at war and under attack
We got P.O.W.s fighting to get back in jail
And these affected by the poverty war
We pack gats frontline and will endure
I go to, bed with god and wake up with the devil
In a battle I blacked out and beat a man with a shovel
Its obligatory that you hear my side of the story
He had the face a fear, shaking like a leaf on a tree
You just another potential casualty
This is a walking corpse song and the beat is your conspiracy theory
And the time is getting more scary
So pack when necessary and say your L.O.D Hail Marys

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo I'm eye of a tiger inside the head of a liar
Give 'em pure hell brimstone and fire
This is MC cannibalism by connoisseur
From the lyrical lexicon matador of metaphor
Yo from the little voice in my conscience
I might just leave your fucking ass unconscious
Yeah I seen you with that smirk on
You little fucking clown I turn that smile into an upside down frown
Produce chaos in the culture of the enemy
You will never posses the skills to defeat me
I be the all eye seeing, you hear it sporadic
I rhyme at will be on your ass automatic
With thoughts of power I rain thunder showers
I eat a lot of brain food and you'll get devoured
Man hunt chase of the night stalker off da leash walker
My dog is a fire barker

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

Yo from the instinctual coming of the insect
To the mind of a genius and the heart of a prophet
To them bootlegged niggas and the chicks that cop it
Ask anyone they know how the fuck drop it
And coasting constant motion essential
With fusion nuclear potential
You hear a cold whisper you see the mask of a phantom acts wailing, deranged assailant
I tame the rage, isolate, chase and kill my prey
Walk the lion out of the cage
And that's a part of life or should I say death
Reach in your mouth snatch out your very last breath
Searching my subconscious for the meaning
I'm sweating blood bullets cause my whole world is bleeding
Oh now check how I come at you
I will eat you, defeat you, I'm parasitical

Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake
Just because you came here
Doesn't mean that you can stay
Just because you woke up this morning
Doesn't mean you can stay awake

There's no where you can run
No way to hide
The world is a cage and we all locked inside
So you might as well fight to survive

Hush up, I rush up, inside your cut
Make you puss up, then bust up, cause my shit bumps

I stay crispy you dissed me you pissy
I'll stomp you out like Hannibal did in Sicily
It's Keith and I got to be a mighty mighty MC -c-c-c-c-c-c
You a savage kid you might as well run around with a pet pig
I see a ugly chick and she's scoping
And I'm like got damn who left the gate open
Most prominent and dominant
Shittin like I'm like lactose intolerant
Meanwhile I hopped the turnstile
With the L. O. D. Ichbabod Crane style
I stepped into some shit them wiped it with my hand
See that's what makes me who I am, goddamn
No if and buts or maybes
Yo! E this shit is crazy baby


OH! That's how it is, that's how you living
I consider all ya as my children
Funk like feet collardgreen and chitlens
I stole your girl while I was in prison (no you didn't)
You can ask E cause he brought her up to see me
Keith you can't smoke weed, man pass the light
My probation thing is gonna be aight! aight!",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-sucka-free-lyrics
Say Whaatt,He’s Keith Murray,2003.0,"ONE-TWO, ONE-TWO
Keith Murray and Jazze Pha
Servin em well and as you all know we are crunk as hell
 (Murray)
Woke up at 8:30 on a Saturday morn
Grab my remote control cut my stereo on
Got up took a dump as I smoke some trees
And my stomach started growling for some egg MC's
I am hard core heavyweight b-boy flex
Other rappers try to flex but they soft as sex
High heels in the kitchen fixin me a hot meal
Wipe my ass ran the faucet then I brush my grill
Jumped in the shower it was boiling hot
So I stayed there an hour cause I like it a lot
Back to my room and throw on some fresh gear
Tank top white tees and some Nike airs
Then I'm interrupted by the ring on the phone
Def Jam Kevin Liles tellin me that it's on
Saying Murray meet me, Lyor and Russell
You provide the heat and we'll provide you wit' that Def Jam muscle
So I said yeah I'm wit it cause you know I'm prepared
Put me in proper position and I'm takin it there
I hung up the phone, went outside
And hopped in the six to bust a joy ride
 (Redman)
Yo dog how many wanna ride wit us and
How many wanna smoke wit us (say what)
Now how many wanna junk wit us and
How many wanna thug wit us (say what)
Now yell if you wanna roll wit us
Yell if you wanna get dough wit us (say what)
Ride-smokin-ride-smokin-ride-ride-smokin-ride (say what)
Let's smoke and ride
 (Murray)
One o'clock on the dot is when I hit the block
Sunshine cold beamin off ya face from my watch
I'm a monsta on these beats also on these streets
Hit the corner then I bumped into some beautiful freaks
They said Murray hold up, stop, wait
Hit the brakes rims spinnin like roller skates
Conversing with the skeeza's for ten minutes more
Hopped back in the ride and then I slammed the door
Ridin through your city wit the hard core beat
Stopped by the spot so I can get somethin to eat
The way I wine and dine people think I do crime
They don't know I'm just a connoisseur of hip hop rhymes
So I got my meal and I said my grace
Thinkin bout the next millions that I'll soon make
Lookon at the clock it said deuce square tre
Wit Georgia on my mind I 2wayed Jazzy Pha

 (Murray)
I heard you suckas don't like me but I ain't concerned
It must be the pretty bitties or the pay that I earn
I'm growin and blowin all up in yo face
Put ya head to the speaker break ya neck to the base
I'm extraterrestrial so expeditious
The first nigga to ever bust a verse on a Lexus
Sucka duck nigga think that they be the man
I don't even say nothin I just wave my hand",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-say-whaatt-lyrics

Verse One: Erick Sermon
I freak a technique Goin Way Back like Just-Ice
And don't think twice because I'm nice
I come from the Mothership unknown to man
With a blunt in my hand, a mic in the other hand
God damn I slam I jam like this
Sure nuff, my rap style is Cold Crush
And plus, I tears the roof off the mothersucker
My brother, fly shit that makes Stevie Wonder
Heyyyy, who can it be now watch out
It's the E live in 3-D with Keith and R-E-D
I gets down for my troops
And I ahh... get-it get-it get-it like Luke
For those, who don't believe my skills get these
I got mad expertise, for all you duck MC's
I'm funky like G Thing my nigga
I wanna know who's up in here, before I pull the trigger
(Is New York up in here? HELL YEAH
Is Def Squad up in here? HELL YEAH
Is NJ up in here? HELL YEAH
The Green Beret's up in here! HELL YEAH)
Verse Two: Redman
Verbally, I sew the brains up like Trapper
John M.D. got nine millis made of lacquer
Count Dracula, back with the, tow-truck with the
Get Biz like Mark fuel-injected like Maximus
My style sicker than an AIDS victim drinkin forty-five malt liquors
I roll the spliff up
The underground, slam, shock like Shazam
Check my Jams get Def when I kick Methods like Man
Computerized Robocop sounds I drop in sequence
Funky to death so ask that old bitch where the beef went
When I do em, I glue em, stick em like Patrick Ewing
My shit bumps like Puerto Rican people moved in
Next door, I get raw with the grrrahhhh!
Call four-one-one cause I'm Ghetto Red Hot
Bo bo bo! Funk Doctor Spock catch a bruisin
My style gets respect fifty Muslims
You hang on strings like loose ends, with my hands on the nine
Watch yo nugget bitch, I get busy with mines

How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines)
How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines)
How's that? (cause I gets busy with mines
It's Keith Murray))
Verse Three: Keith Murray
I come rollin in when I see that low flow
Heckuva foe, heard a gun and settled for a metaphor
I'm naive between the sleeves of the sheets
Murderin, who should ever try to fuck with me
Murray word is bond gets it on
And ready to blow any nigga out the cypher of the sniper hype at dawn
Long live Def to the Squad
And we smokin everybody out there, shit it ain't that hard
I brings classic drama microphone enbalmer
Have your momma beg behind bars for your kidneys tomorrow
My murderous apprentice E Dub
Makes hard funk beats that I become part of
When I be like A-E-I-O-U or battle
Niggas be like who who who who who like night owls

In my mouth back when hip hop was hip hop
For those who don't know or forget
To make y'all happy with Mary J. who Puff came to get (Me)
Then who called for Total to make y'all see (Me)
Then who he called again for Special Delivery (That a be me)
There's nothin you could tell me, I rocked every hole in the wall

House niggas like the Fannie Mae Foundation
The K don't play f**k around touche' and toupee
What you say get done away like Faye
I rhyme flagrant you sweeter than a sugar fragrance
Ignoramus, blow your brains out on a pavement
The game we been milkin for awhile like a green cow
You seregant MC, that ain't your style
Metaphors dawn on you in time like revelations
Battlin Keith, self mutilation
Let it be sensible, I'll make you invisible
Niggas can't see me the flow is invincible
My style royalty like residuals
You subjectable, hospitable y'all niggas is despicable

That's why your lovin me cause can't nobody do it better

Takin you to the Legion of Dume, and beyond
This is a Pay Per View event
Some shit you wanna hear, yaknahmsayin?
Let's get ready to rumble, yeah..

When my, Funk's mastered like Flex
I touch more earsets than Nynex
LBM puts words together like Triple Yahtzee
Performin open heart surgeries with a hand-grip shottie
My creepy wisdom mixed with leaky ism splits em
And attacks the rhythm like an exorcism
Blood leaks out my ink pen, I start killin
Stinkin, bitches like ??Joe Rifkind??
(Rifkind.. Rifkind..) YAHH!!
I strangle angels from a Brooklyn angle
Rectangular mangle (and TANGO) incur single

P-A-S-S-I-O-N

As the world goes around, I'm breakin down competitors
Like the predator, niggas check my metaphors
(yea, word up) Let the bullshit, ride, put the clip inside the steel
When the verbal starts to peel, motherfuckers know the deal (YEAH)
Like AC/DC (word?) I'm charged off the energy
The cipher is my soul psych the soul is my serenity (word up)
Time and time again I grip the pen with a vengeance
Disruption of your cypher niggas label me a menace
The villain, I'm feelin, another, lyrical combustion
Eruptin, bustin out my brain (whoo!)
So ignite the flame it's the lyrically insane
I, open up the vault searchin for the buried treasure
With ?? in the brain, increase the measures do whatever

Whatever.. NIGGAZ!  K-Keith Mu..
Keith what?  Y'all niggas don't want it, I get widdit
Quicker, than a nigga with a piss-bag done shitted
Niggas, be like, quit it
Cause my renditions be expeditions
For niggas on them straight looney missions (nigga)
Funk Lord Productions be sayin somethin (word)
For niggas in the street who wanna fight
And press charges, I got somethin (bitch)
Throw that, you could get the bozack
Cause I leave homicide mummified and all you hoes know that

Right about now, it's Kelly Kel
Kel Vicious, bout to get.. ill

I make a hundred crews give me enough respect
Cause my shit got the major funk effect, so check it
Select it, my rap style be highly respected
Challenge Kel Vicious get burnt, expect it
I'm twenty-one, and I'm a phe-nom-enon
The Def Squad, L.O.D. live on and on
These forty ounce drinkers, drinkers, big drug sellers
Smellin like a blunt and if you front I'll split your melon
What's your name?  Kelly Kel, where you from?  I'm from C.I
What the FUCK you wanna know for punk?  You ready to die?
Your biological clock, is tickin while I'm kickin
Forty ounce dreams of blunts and wishes for you trick-ass bitches
This is Mr. Kel Vicious with the ill funk flow
Knockin punks out like my name was Riddick Bowe

Snatchh your fuckin' head from your neck

Strickly murder
Legion of Doom 94
Word 'em up this is how we do that shit
Techs to your record son. Shit
Fuck that shit
Word 'em up that how we're always been
Yo check it, I feel the vibe like Shanet
Collaborate on niggas brains and bend you ass like a Sinse'
My death sentense is danger
I black out like Joe Ripken niggas hittin' the floor like the chamber
The sick authorist transmits for no repent
And activate the plan the Pentagon inelligents
So listen close like musical chairs
The L.O.D. is deep then the niggas Under The Stairs
I crack million dollar script like an archetict
And execute like the chair when I inflict death
I got the creepiest slang in this galaxy
And wreck the industry so mysteriously
Coming with the funk from beneath I creep straight for juggelars
And twist rap caps for all you motherfuckers
Walk the bloody streets with 19 shots in the lueger
Niggas be scared to face 50 Grand like Medusa
The shit I produce is like gin and juice when it blend
Scenes from Toni Braxton you'll Never Breath Again
I rhyme without ability to reason, niggas is guilty of treason
Who's to blame but the Legion to the Doom
With punk niggas we got beef so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)
On the mic we definatly got beats so
(L.O.D. about to take it to the streets)
Roy Jay go the wickedest mystic magestic flow
From a homicidal clique, Yo E make that psycopathic mix
I hits for the hecks or the shit that causes conflict in the script
Beeotch my style set on fire to touch Venus
My soul seeks the universe while I'm sleepin'
I'm creepin' makin' myself develop with the chronic
Electronic Million Dollar Man the mic bionic
So you can feel it in your nerves when I blast off into the suburbs
Conduct like ? with electrofying words
I freak to them suicidal tracks break backs
Niggas scarred fakin' fuckin' heart atttacks
Oooh when I'm comin' through the crowd
Niggas want static yo I got the gun pazoow, wizoow, word up
I got the slaughter for your brains drive you insain
Fuck that shit
The moderation incobation of my creation
Is instantaniously with my vocabulation accumulation
Trust me as I bust thee, lyrical homicidal shit from Keith Murray
If I had twenty four hours to live and one wish
I wouldn't wish for no damn lifesavers
I'd start going wild like Larry Davis
The funk speach vigalante from the L.O.D
Gets funky freakly and freaky fluently
And deep as Greek mythology on level Z
Theres six million ways to die
And eight million stories in the naked city and all them shits are lies
So I keep my wittiest ironist hidious
Psychosis bloodiest flow decitious
Comin' from out this orbit deep space 9's wiggle my shit
Meltin' crew down like synthetic acid
Come half steppin' fession' through a section
And get the midsection of your brain drain
With mad man expression, no quesion and no second guessin'
Yo forty dreams and blunts for witches
Yeah that's what we got for them niggas
Yo lets get on it get off it
L.O.D. we won't forfit
A-yo check it out

Hey yo, this goes out to my man
Adrissa Knockout Beauwright
And Anthony Apple Ames, word is bond
I'm talkin' to my peoples all across the land
Relate to the situation at hand
I know everybody done been in some shit
And ready to lay niggas to rest just to prove it but check it
We done did it, seen it, done it, been through it
Swigged it, guzzled it, copped it, smuggled it
Rocked it, chopped it, locked it
Now we got the whole neighborhood goin' through it
Ay yo, money in the hood make the game go good
We only rock black Timbs, black jeans and black hoods
Karl Kani wasn't even out
Dressin' fly, rockin' jams is what it was all about
We had dreams of doin' shit niggas never even heard of
Then damn my partner got murdered
I was with my man, I'll never forget you baby
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
Ay yo, close the blinds when you cookin', my neighbors be lookin'
My nerves is shooken so fuck it I'm off to Brooklyn
To see my cousin with the devilish grin, devilish way of livin'
But fuck it, he's still chillin'
Adrissa Knockout Beauwright drunk forties all night
While I did the mic something right
Catchin' wreck or we was playin' ball
Gettin' busy in any little hole in the wall y'all
Street soldiers with good head on our shoulders
Wanted to go to school to be doctors and lawyers
Well, I got caught up in the system with two ounces
Had to do a little time in the big houses
Before I even knew it I felt it
Ay yo, yo your cousin Knockout got murdered, what?
Damn, that was my man
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
I'm on the cuttin' edge 'cause I'm young and black
Now I feel like I got a monkey on my back
But you know I'm stronger than that, of course
I puff on El and stay mental just knock 'em off
I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill
Listenin' to my Squad members tell me 'go for the kill'
As I smell the vapors linger
I saw jealousy bring the anger in the chest with a banger
I'm on a rage against the machine, what I mean
I want to see my people with more than just first of the month cream
The situation's always lookin' grim
Pregnant teenagers with kids that can't take care of 'em
For the niggas who did it, word to life I'ma get with ya
Peace to my peoples, I never forget ya 'cause you was my mans

I'll keep holdin' on

Don't none of that shit impress me
Oh, I'm supposed to listen cause they on the radio?
Psssh, I'm ready
I got, nuttin to lose in the world to gain
I leave you slain and make your family relocate and change their names
Like the West coast say, I'm bout the ?macolay?
Niggas be slippin when I be flippin and I'll see you next trip
Cause revenge is a motherfucker payback is a bitch
Especially when I'm coin with that Def Squad click
Can you relate to an intense, motherfucker
Gridiron mic cuffer, terror to the jugular
Smother all the others, punk motherfuckers
But I'ma keep it real, cause me and you is brothers
It'll happen so fast boy you won't stand a chance
Cause the L.O.D. put in work like red ants
And when I walk by Curtis Mayfield'll draft
And spell the full limp love is just like Shaft
Shit I craft, is harder than Chinese math
Plus I lay you down for standing on Dangerous Ground
Chorus: Keith Murray, 50 Grand (with variations)
Aiyyo you're standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown
Let's see if you know the bounds
I said you're standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown
Let's see if you know the bounds
Aiyyo y'all standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown
Let's see if you know the bounds
Yo kid you standing on Dangerous Ground, too close to the crown
Let's see if you know the bounds

Let's embark on this mission like Black Indiana Jones
Is eatin Pookie sandwiches and smokin chronic bones
See I kill it a little, then leave it alone
Let my man 50 G drag it into his zone

Now 50 Grand's in the room and Legion of Doom
And if you sayin Def Squad's the bomb then I'll assume
It's takes brain splittin compositions, makin incisions
Dranin the blood up out silly niggas, like morticians

Now I'ma mack out and pimp the rhythm like Too $hort and Dru Down
And wait for what go around to come around
And beat it in the head with this, send em off into the unknown
In and out of conciousness, kind of like
A hip-hop microphone hypnotic
Specialist in gettin inside artists, sick word analyst
World's most foul freestylist
C'mon man y'all niggas know y'all can't get with this
Chorus

And kill the noise playboys cause we have no flaws
We employ hits the whole family can enjoy
I'll be masterin the Funk like Flex, mentally
Etchin and Sketchin, speakin with my hands like Terminator X and
Scheme and get choked out like Radio Raheem
My team'll put you to sleep and let you dream
I'm not down with the East West coast controversy
Me say you you say me, across the country makin millis
I'll be glad to see a brother get paid for hard work
But instead y'all steady tryin to ditch up the dirt

Yeah niggas still tryin to toss salt in the game
And y'all done read my name graffitied in the walls of fame
Let me explain niggas die for fame in this game my name's
Like a migraine, rappers get banged out the frame
See some funny style niggas in the house tonight
With posses too thin to win, and too light to fight
Think twice
Chorus

I had the last watch and y'all niggas on the corner pumpin gas
Nervous like you lyin to a polygraph

Come see a real show, cut off your flow, killin you slow
One time for L.O., I'm like a thief, in your window

Or catch us in the streets, herdin like cattle
Defeatin rappers without contracts and battles, swingin like Mickey Mantle

Niggas trippin like they wanna be me
Challenge Def Squad, L.O.D. you livin Dangerously",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-dangerous-ground-feat-50-grand-lyrics
Shut The F*ck up,It’s a Beautiful Thing,1998,"Is it on?
Faggot ass niggas, talkin all that bullshit
Worried about what I do but I don't give a f*ck
You know what I'm sayin, cuz if I listen to that shit...
I be the metaphorical Don Juan's upon
My confidant bring my words to life, make shit bond
See the lyrical lexicon makes strong songs DJ's gotta throw on
Thug niggas love to bug along
And wack MC's dream on and on
Drifting further from reality, concentratin on me flow on
I master murderous phrases simile, homicidal delivery
And don't give a f*ck who don't like me
See we be, the type of MC's bringing equilibrium into the industry
Your own peeps say you pussy
I show up unexpectedly to the release party
Get up close and personally snatch your body
Often say, place your life status see on crtically
But y'all just sound like you dissin me subliminally
See you walkin contradiction, caught up in the friction
If you can't stand the heat, stay the f*ck out the kitchen
In front of the whole industry on national TV
I'll bluntly, tell you to shut the f*ck up
To all you got the pen niggas
Shut the f*ck up
All you stinky, dirty tramps
Shut the f*ck up
All the hoes on his dick
Shut the f*ck up
All you lyin motherf*ckers
Shut the f*ck up
You'd be surprised what niggas go through to dis the squad
Call our business lines tryin na sound all f*ckin hard
When your man dialed the number, heard my voice, jumped on my dick
Then you grabbed the phone and started poppin mega shit
Then tried to kick a little bullshit rhyme or two
About how much money you can make and how much damage you can do
But the simple fact is that you wanna be me
Redman, Erick Sermon, and the L.O.D
But the next time you wanna be me look in the mirror
The next time you leave a voice mail speak clearer
Fun loving criminal, savage mic killer
Comes through by way of knockout on the strength of my niggas
Ther arsenal successor, mister apply the pressure
On niggas frontin like the Nutty Professor
I pull you foul, track you down like a private detective
Then put you in your proper perspective
And tell you shut the f*ck up
To all you shitty drawls cats
Shut the f*ck up
All you fake thug niggas
Shut the f*ck up
All you gay ass niggas
Shut the f*ck up
All you media freaks
Shut the f*ck up
All you hype motherf*ckers
Shut the f*ck up
All you fake drug dealers
Shut the f*ck up
You better shut the f*ck up, shut the f*ck up
You better shut the f*ck up, shut the f*ck up",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-shut-the-fck-up-lyrics
Rhymin’ Wit Kel [feat. Kel-Vicious],Enigma,1996,"Come on, yeah
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
I'm stanking strong, 23 years old, now
With the big, bang boogie and the big pow pow
Not much, just keepin' it tight
With the Philly Blunt King gettin' high as a kite
I got no time for bullshittin', I have to start lickin'
'Cause niggas get jeal off the shit Kel be kickin'
Get your free head up 'cause I'm seven foot tall
And I ain't scared of none of y'all, this shit is off the wall
I be the genie in your lamp, the face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker stompin' all through your camp
We went from smokin' weed in bullen therapy
To takin' suckers out on national TV
So on and so on, furthermore in other words
We kick niggas heads to the curb
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
I shook hands all across the land from here to Japan
Back to the motherland up to Canada
Nigga, I'll Jeru the Damaja
Your rap style is weak and it has no stamina
Ayyo, this is for the big quzzlers
Gun smugglers, drug jugglers and the chelua puffers
Mister Armor to all, you gonna take a fall
For tryin' to walk before you crawl
We'll kick 120 rhymes in 60 seconds
Niggas standing on the sideline feeling disrespected
While I dissected your shit get ejected
I got Kel-Vicious, the malicious next to wreck it
We can make this shit hot or we can keep it cool
But as soon as a nigga violate the rules
I get the spot hot quick, yo, Kel be illin' and shit
'Cause I be comin' down the block with the pistol grip
With all this violence in the world, how could I not be a crook?
I could stick a nigga up with my mean fuckin' looks
Make a bitch drop her draws, grab the microphone and pause
There's many casualties of war, Killer Kel is at the door
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
Who you wit? Where you at?
I be the mad, mad scientist, mad conquesting
Getting quick dough like off-track betting
Overall, y'all niggas be dead on arrival
Meanwhile, me and Kel be buggin' off survival
My supportin' cast will bust that ass
I got a beeper and a phone but you can find me on the Ave
Y'all niggas definitely ain't got nothing fur us
We'll take it to the streets on Stallone and Chuck Norris
You want a wake up call, I got the itchy finger, y'all
Can't be sleeping on the block 'cause that's when I clock
And it's New Jack City, smacking motherfuckers out like bitties
Boy, you're bad, boy, you're rude, boy, you're vicious
Fuck it, niggas, get bust now for lookin' suspicious
I got a 9, pack 9 lives like a cat
Word is bond, niggas try to bust, I bust 'em back
And I don't give a fuck about me or you
I damage your whole family, plus, your crew",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-rhymin-wit-kel-feat-kel-vicious-lyrics
Whut’s Happnin’,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro:
Niggas can't hold me back
We ain't comin' for no bullshit
Niggas talking all that yackedy yack word up
Verse 1:
Here's to Mrl Keith Murray
The Mr. Pictionary
The Mr. quicck to fuck shit up in a hurry
ON the mic I'll squash you little Ms. Philosoophy
With atomic technological atrocity
I find it very ironic that niggas try to rhyme behind me
The supersonic Def Squad MC
Get bird's eye view
And don't miss the crispiest nigga in the nucleus
With futuristic linguistics
Ballistics be twisted like physics (word up)
Niggas be like how you come up wit this shit
But it's automatic, I'm inorganic
With the ability to travel nine planets
Niggas can't undrstand it, please
I spark the brain of your G's
We could battle for car keys and car titles
House deeds and bank accounts to make it final
I got what you need
The most homicidal words to co9me out of a human being
Mind state sick like Idi Amin
Hook:
You can do what ya got to
And say what you may
But niggas gonna come outside wit gun play anyway
So I play the game
And let the ball bounce where it may
And roll with Def Squad and L.O.D. everday X2
Verse 2:
Abracadabra talk shit I'll reach right out and grad ya
The hype got you like gimmy
Don't let it have ya
I'll knowck you skeezas pleasers black like Jesus
Never lost in the jungle
Navigators with caesars
Instead dare iz a dark side said by Red
I'm consciously, crusciously coming for your head
I'm from a small coast call stay out my path
And from a big city called foot up in your ass
Jeepers, weepers, peepers get snuffed
By the sneakiest, throughout the speakers
Like fist to cuffs
Who the fuck is this paging me?
Oh, it's my creepy, greepy, grimy
Rough rhyme, crimy Reggie, I'm saying
Fuckwho, went where, when, why and how
Get my shit to me not now but right now
Lucky niggas went platinum
Thinkin' they can see us
We swoop down on crews
Like angels on dust
I'll leave you mental so broke
You can't pay attention
When I get inside your head
And take your brain to another dimension
I'm itching for a scratch
And somebody to try to match
The battle cat constatly be on it like that
The doom has dawned in
We knockin' niggas out without warning
And pissing on them
The configuration is brain cell wastin'
Renegades of funk
Like Africa Bambatta and the Zulu Nation
You facin' a maniac
Pacing over the track
Constantly bringing drama like Jason
In fact I'm L.O.D.ing it and there go planet Def Squad
Puttin' it down play for play like Ahmad Rashad
For the cause, I""m wiring jaws
Got niggas eating full-course meals out of crazy straws
And if it win't def it ain't shit
I'm taking it to the limit
And killing it each and every minute
Cause Keith Murray takes the beef a major step higher
And peace makers will get causght in the cross fire
Hip Hop's filled with back stabbers
Blunt grabbers, cats with dirty claws, dogs with filthy paws
Then you got rap artists
Claimin' to be the hardest
Bust them in their shit
And they're quick to press charges
Spot rushers, block busters, rockin' diamond clusters
Comin' to stick the rich out you motherfuckers
Educated black man on premises
L.O.D. and Def Squad forever Arch nemesis",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-whuts-happnin-lyrics
No Matter Where You Be,Puff Puff Pass,2008.0,"No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah

Yo, niggas talking reckless cause they think they could
Meanwhile, killers is lurking in your hood
Niggas go to jail, and be dying left to right
Meanwhile, yall promoting bullshit on the mic
The wages are war, your cross means death
And we gon’ keep banging, till none of us left
I’ve done grew up with some too many real niggas that passed
And let you cross my path, and knife get up in yo ass
I see my first body ? future
Where I first bare to witness what the gats do to ya
Niggas yelling static, getting outta place
Meanwhile, Doolam with a hole in his face
You can’t live forever, sometimes you gotta go
But Where? When? And How? Only we know
He just got about the system, when ?
Now ? I was just with em’
(You fucking with the best, boy)

No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah

My pops passed in ’85 and my moms ‘91
Ever since then, I’ve been in the streets on the run
You come into this world alone and you leave alone
But somebody coming with me, cause I keep the chrome
I roll with Def Squad and Legion of Doom
But you can feel the devil, when he’s inside the room
Its like only happens to real terror ones
Meanwhile, you cowords still alive and you having your fun
They say, karma is when you get exact energy back
A lotta good dudes pass, where the karma in that
And faggots is looking for some type of directions
Meanwhile, my squad is taking the section
25-to-life or few to the head
Anyway you look at it, both these niggas dead
My all day, forte is plotting to scheme it
Even when I’m dreaming, I be chasing demons
(You fucking with the best, boy)

No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah
(Happen Just That Fast)

I trying to cherish these small things I get in life
Cause' you can wake up in the morning and be dead daylight
Man, drink to my memories, fuck the sorrow
Cause you too, can be in today and gone tomorrow
Me and 50 Grand was walking by Quad studios, where Pac' got hit up
But that ain't when he died though
Since the lil nigga, running from the scene outta breath
Always seem to come up close brush with death
No stranger, I lost like 10 over the years
And thats not count of like 50 of my peers
So you can try to deceive the masses with lies
But telling the truth nigga, do you wanna die?
(You fucking with the best, boy)

No matter where you be
The Streets gonna test
Slugs in your chest
No matter where you rest
Better step back
Cause we be the best, yeah",https://genius.com/Keith-murray-no-matter-where-you-be-lyrics
U Ain’t Nobody (feat. Def Squad),Rap-Murr-Phobia (The Fear of Real Hip-Hop),2007.0,"(Def Squad) (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you know what it is (L.O.D.)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

Who the fuck, am I, fuel to the fire
You washed up niggas should be thrown in the dryer
And in due time I'll pull your cover
And then you'll suffer, you foul motherfucker
You baldheaded sucker, your body full of blubber
You only got here 'cause moms popped the rubber
I got your number, and I don't care who you get
My click is sick, y'all can all lay under
And nigga you old, I don't wanna go
To a all-time low with your kids screamin' (NO!)
You a liar, you're stingy and phony too
That's why your people in your own hood hate you
And niggas try to comb out my wig
I split 'em wide, it's all outdoors like zig-zag-zig
To whom it may be concernin', the crew is Def Squad
And I'm the Green Eyed Bandit, Erick Sermon

You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (L.O.D.)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

And I just love when a nigga try to pop that shit
I dare a nigga ever try to challenge my intelligence
Your flow is irrelevant, I'm fresh, that's evident
My 360's sick, I call 'em Seabiscuit's
Check his vocabulary, listen to his flow
He sayin' things that I said seven years ago
And it ain't about how many niggas you got
It's about who drove first and who get popped
I'm a chip off the old block, hip off the old hop
Clip out the gold Glock, pimp out the whole spot
Sell out the whole stock - stop sleepin' on me
Motherfuckers, wake up, last stop
And I don't play games, y'all dudes is Tetris
I'll kill MC's over Instant Message
I got it, I'll front it, you want it, come and get it
You know I don't care, I'm with it, 'cause I live it

You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (Gilla House)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

Yo, I'll rock backyard to backyard
A fat broad to the snack bar
I'll shut down another rap star
My arm like Terry Bradshaw
Out in Cali they jungle talk like Madagascar
Redman raw, still here nigga
More Fresh than the Prince in Bel-Air nigga
Like O.D.B. I take welfare nigga
Rob the mailman, shit, hell yeah nigga
The strong move silent, laws to adopt to
But in Brick City, the silent get shot too
You gonna stop who? It's Redman
I plan to stick around like a Spiderman costume
L.O.D., somebody woke the ape up
So I'm a ride for 2 Tek and A-Plus
Def Squad niggas whoop yo' ass
Fuck a punchline, my shit is hook and jab
Bitch!

You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
