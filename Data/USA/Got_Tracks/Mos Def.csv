Mathematics,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo
 
for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions,
 
6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the 
Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the 5th when the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at?
 What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't niggas""
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics

Ms. Fat Booty,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

Man, duke I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up dog, I'm telling you man
Shit is wild man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

In she came with the same type game
The type of girl giving out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The swims at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leaving now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sipping Cris straight up, skanking, winding her waist up
Scene 2 - my fam's throwing a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Ayo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!) it was the same pretty bird
Who I had priorly observed trying to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feeling? ""Oh, I'm fine"" My name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sitting directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm looking at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fucking with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh, yeah, you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

She blew my whole head with that duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though, I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazing she was just
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me (and shit)

""Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right, but baby you know what it's like
Some brothers don't be coming right""
I understand, I'm feeling you
Besides, ""can I have a dance?"" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 - weeks of dating late night conversation
In the crib heart racing, trying to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smiling, singing Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showing me her tan line and her tattoo
Playing Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burning candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., come now, I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rocking the P-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call I feel I'm running a fever
Six months, I'm telling her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really trying to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She telling me commitment is something she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ahh, damn it, my shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Power
Uh
Madlib-erator
Def operator
Rock the data
Amazin' flavor

The way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus
The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flow forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere: penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas trying to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life, holla black you know it well

What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, here it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is

Ecstatic! (En punto)
Peace, power
Fantastic
So original
And always on time and rockin ya mind (Ruler!)

Sit and come relax, riddle of the mac
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well, say, about noonish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry, ""What's wrong G? Hungry?""
""No, gimme my oil or get  out my country""
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff (""Jihad!"")
'Til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feeling like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, ""Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!"" (Bye!)
Buying apples I'm breakin' on, ""You take everything
Why not just take the damn food, black bastard?""
Like I don't understand it, on another planet
15-months of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crap
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (""La-Di-Da-Di"")
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

Omar: Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries
Ali: They sent you?
Omar: Yeah, so? Here

What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know

Hip Hop,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"You say ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on!
Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, (huh!)

My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister
, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, 
stay fluid even in staccato
 (Mos Def)
Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, 
low
 to the ground with ammunItion
(Chi-chi-pow)
 Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)

The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) 
Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline
, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-hip-hop-lyrics

Tomorrow may never show up

I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can

I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can

Put my heart and soul into this song
I hope you feel me
From where I am, to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely

Very close to you, so close to you

I look around and, things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes, sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away (Like a dove)
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man, going insane, losing my brain
Trying to maintain, doing my thang
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me where I am, to wherever you are
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but

Eat, sleep it, and bleed it

Asphalt to the cement

This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well
Doing it sans assistance, is do it yourself
Doing it below the radar, we doing it stealth
Doing it again for Illadelph and who else

I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now like here's Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now is how to find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla, bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You’re just hoping he don’t get rope for your throat to choke anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fucking bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fucking drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fucking cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
Tell Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture

Hold me, like you know I'll never go

Well go'head and leave
The call heard around the world from the wives of MCs
These cats is paying more than half a pound
My garment bag'll snatch it down
Ain't got the skate, but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern emcee, ie. the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhyming, no different from coal mining
We both on assignment, to unearth the diamond
While you start climbing in 'em, I start shining
You be struggling and striving
And they think you prime timing
Maintain and keep silent
Make note and observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
My concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
Bout to reach my destination
With no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation
Cause this ain't no recreation
This is pro-ball

To drop these heavy ass bags up off my back bone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walking, been away for that long
But no you haven't well at least that's how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks
 smoking greenery
Easily take it for granted when you up in it
But it's sweet scented, when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits, break 'em down with the vinitage
The inovinin', classical b-boy image
Collect the winnings
Cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago no we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Mina-san, make everybody out in Nippon
Say ichiban, me God man bo where you hitting from

If you can hear me ladies and gentlemen
Then I'm very happy that you came here
Ooh-oooh, whee!
That was for Brooklyn
Ha ha, we get it every time
You got me on? Oh
Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South
All the continent, Europe, all abroad international
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
It's a lot of things goin' on y'all
21st century is comin'
20th century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not, mainly us
We gon' get it together right? I believe that
Listen—people be askin' me all the time
""Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip-hop?""
(Where do you think hip-hop is goin'?)
I tell em, ""You know what's gonna happen with hip-hop?
Whatever's happening with us""
If we smoked out, hip-hop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin' alright, hip-hop is gonna be doin' alright
People talk about hip-hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside
Comin' down to visit the townspeople
We are hip-hop
Me, you, everybody, we are hip-hop
So hip-hop is going where we going
So the next time you ask yourself where hip-hop is going
Ask yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?
Till you get a clear idea
So if hip-hop is about the people
And the hip-hop won't get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better? (Hmm)
Well, from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or 'cause somebody, think they sexy
But they valuable 'cause they been created by God
And God makes you valuable
And whether or not you recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin' to be God, wishing that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere
And make you think they got the all-seeing eye
Eh, I guess The Last Poets wasn't too far off
When they said that certain people got a god complex
I believe it's true
I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that
Helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the satellite dishes
They just wishing
They can't really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law
When they tell me to try to have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them
And this is what I'm saying to you check it

All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen, keep a record in time
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here
On this place called Earth, holding down my square

'Bout to do it for y'all, and y'all at the fair
So just bounce, come on bounce
B-b-bounce b-bounce b-bounce-bounce
And just-
Just step, two, three
Just step, two, three, and
Step two
Two, three and
One two three and four
One two three and four
Once again

All over the world hearts pound with the rhythm
Fear not of men because men must die
Mind over matter and soul before flesh
Angels hold a pen keep a record in time
Which is passing and running like a caravan trader
The world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked
But God is sufficient in disposing of affairs
Gunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear
But God is sufficient over plans they prepared
Mos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here
On this place called Earth, holding down my square

Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
Bout to represent in your whole atmosphere
To your atmosphere, to your atmosphere

Oh No!,Lyricist Lounge 2 ,2000.0,"One for the treble, two for the bass
Welcome to the great incredible paper chase
Keep your boots laced if you want to keep pace

Oh No!
Niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been 7 days, the same clothes
Ask them originals cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim, I independently lay it down
And played my game, my own two raise my flame
Cause dickriding ain't my thang
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm getting it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad cause I'm getting caked out from my bookings
When y'all was asking permission I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
Cause after this year the price ain't coming down
And if you got a joint bubbling then get money now
Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble coming out
Just a warning, as usual some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame the 
jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement
, 
they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 
7-1 Precinct
Call it a day or make it a long evenin
You keep on scheming, man give me some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screaming ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than y'all cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down it's got to be bothering y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Put your pride on the rocks, make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do or die stay rumbling and bumbling hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East coast on your neck and you ain't shrugging it off
Try to bullyfoot and end up stumbling off
I'm Daddy Brooklyn, y'all niggas are the sons of New York
Getting spanked when there's too much trouble to talk
Respect mine

Oh No!
Look at who they let in the back door
From Long Beach to Brooklyn, they know
We rock from the east to west coast
Queens, salute to Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose

Very contagious raps should be trapped in cages
Through stages of wackness, Pharoahe's raps are blazin
And it amazes - me how you claim thug
But go two-ways without Skytel pagers
I'm intellectual, pass more essays
Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's
, 
thus what I vent is just
What you lust to vent,
 
it's irrele'
Huh, hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll do ya
Maintain the same frame of mind - screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures
I'm equipped to rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbal osmosis
Coast to coast, we boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dosage is leaving you mentally unfocused here
MC's just come on 'round!
You're the next contestants on ""Catch-A-Beat-Down""
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks the sediment
It's evident we medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's infinite when I'm in it
All windows is tinted
How you seeing me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that
Pharoahe's flows blows shows like afros
We hate y'all though, that's why Nate Dogg goes

Oh No!

Mr. Nigga,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"Say ho, everybody say ho
By the way yo
I said take it slow like way back in the day-yo
By the way yo, everybody say ho
Everybody say hooooo- hooo
Everybody say ho

And check it out now
Who is the cat eating out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the highrise elevator
Other tenants who be prayin that he ain't the new neighbor
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want

He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show
(Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze
 (say word)
Checks with Os, o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe, watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the Os on his check
The 
po-po
 stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race
That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase
Say they want you successful, but that ain't the case
You living large, your skin is dark, they flash a light in your face

Now, who is cat dining out on the town
Maitre'd wanna take a whole year to sit him down
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat at Armani buying wears
With the tourists who be asking him, do you work here?
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga

Yo, the Abstract with the Mighty Mos Def
White folks gotta mumble the chorus beneath they breath
(I didn't say it!)
But they'll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar, while this song is in they car
And even if they've never said it, lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight, the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially, talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed, put an extra lime on my water glass
An hour later here she come by, walkin' past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
(Wowwww.. Mr. Nigga I love you, I have all your albums!..)
They stay on nigga patrol on American roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane, go where they please
But I go over seas and I get over-seized
London, Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think the dark faces smuggle 
weight
 in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalyis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained 'til damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology, and no regard
Even for the big American rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr. Nigga VIP jail cell, just for me
(If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake)
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo

Now, who is cat riding out on the town
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill
They gotta send it to the lab to make sure the shit is real
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga.. Nigga

You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna
Woody Allen molested and married his step-daughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michael's name
Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game (holding hands)
Sit back and just bug, think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?
O.J. found innocent by jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for the last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?
If white boys doing it, well, it's success
When I start doing, well, it's suspect
Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money
America's five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up
It's new, y'all livin off of slave traders' paper
But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though
I'm puttin up the big swing for my kids, yo
Got my mom the fat water-front crib, yo
I'm a get her them pretty bay windows
I'm a cop a nice home to provide in
A safe environment for seeds to reside in
A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in

Brooklyn,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminesce on Bed-Stuy when I was spry and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thuggin
How me and Charlie Chims, I'm only bugging
Fast forward, nine now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sittin roadside, that ain't part of the plan
I'm out here for my fam doin all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cause we prone to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes, we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first hardest, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the Dutch many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go

Good MORNINNNNNNNNNGG Vietnam
(We live in Brooklyn baby X2)
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push your wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Fulton and Jay got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbing it, form partnership
Increase armament, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shout out ""Go Brooklyn"", they representing it
Sitting on their front stoop sipping Guinnesses
Using native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenements
To the Mom and Pop local shop businesses
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we call it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncommon
From Sumner to Tompkins to Lafayette Gardens
Wyckoff, Gowanus, in their army jacket linings
Yo, this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya going wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The 90s, and all my yarda trini Brown's Village
Parkside tennis courts, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starrett City getting busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Canarsie
Farragut, Fort Greene, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be playin loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown strongly
Raise it up

Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the News Two crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin' you can't relax
The crack babies tryin to find where they mamas at
It's off the handle black, with big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stompin' grounds, where you find a pound of smoke is at
Be blazin' John that have your wave cap floatin' back
The doorstep where the disposessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin' Zovirax
You big balling, better keep your money folded back
Cause once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MCs was a local cat",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-brooklyn-lyrics

Yeeesss?

Would you read us a bedtime story please?

Okay, okay. Ya'll tucked in?

Yeessss...

Heeeere we go...
Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore Adidas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people was behaving like hip-hop was good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By a little 
Sha-tan
 and this is what he said
""Me and you kid we gonna make some cash
Jacking old beats and making the dash...""
They jacked the beats, money came with ease
But son, he couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He jacked another and another, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder
Set some R & B over the track for ""Deep Cover"" (187!)
The kid got wild, started acting erratic
He said ""Yo, that presidential I got to have it...""
With liquor in his belly son, he made up the track
But little did he know that his joints was wack
The shiny A & R said ""Great new hit, G!""
""Whenever you need a loop, yo come get me...""
The kid got amped and he starts to figure
""I'mma get dough like all of these other niggas!""
So, he's in the studio working round the clock
For pop radio, jacked the beat to 'Planet Rock'
Was out in the street when he met this sister
Who couldn't sing for shhhh but the mix would assist her
Hooked up the track and in excitation
He decided he'd head for the radio station
But (What?) he was running and he made a left
Was skeezing at top speed and ran into Mos Def
I slowed the young man down and I started: ""Yo money
Yo, why you selling lies to our wives and children?""
He ran upstairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door then guess who he saw? (Who?)
Jane the chickenhead radio host
Who be yapping 'bout beef between east and west coast
He said ""This one's a bullet, you got to give it run!""
The chicken said ""Thanks"" and spanked it #1
He went outside, was getting props all over
Then he dipped into his ride, the 4-point Rover
Raced up the block doing 83
Some cats with Hennessey saw him at a R-E-D
He winked his eye like his star status mattered
They rat-a-tat-tatted to make his blood splatter
""You rocking crazy ice and all you do is cling static
And rolling out in Brooklyn late night is problematic...""
His eyes was bloody red, he hung on every word they said
They told the kid ""Back down, that player shit is dead.""
Deep in his heart, he knew he was gone
But he grabbed his .45 and decide to blaze on
With shades on founded had him astounded and
Before long the young man got surrounded
Those grabbed the guns, so goes the glory
And this is the way I got to end this story
He was out chasing cream and the American dream
Trying to pretend the ends justify the means
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
It's just what comes to pass when you sell your ass
Life is more than what your hands can grasp
Good night!

When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines

My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you gotta pursue

Praise the beneficent, element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?

Poor so hard, my clean clothes look grimy, pretty women don't mind me
So what's fifty grand to a young nigga like me? More than my annual salary
Poor so hard, this shit crazy, walk outside the whole world hate me
Nervous stares at the thoroughfare, surveillance cameras, police tracing
Poor so hard, this shit weird, we be home and still be scared
There's grief here, there's peace here, easy and hard to be here
Psycho, liable to turn Michael, take your pick, Myers, Myers, Myers, same shit
Poor so hard, got holey socks, dope block on my stove top
Jumbotrons for astronauts, high in orbit off planet rock, say
Poor so hard, this chopper too, we starving Marvin, you hot food
There's birds of prey, no escape, open-air prison, local zoo
Poor so hard, who getting faded? Little Maurice in the sixth grade
No mama, no father, role model the dope game, say
Poor so hard, bitch behave, standing behind the deuce-deuce-trey
Ice-cold, heat blow, closed casket, cold case

Poor so hard, that shit cray

These young bloods is looking scary at the mall
They wearing pants, you can still see they drawers
They rob a nigga in the bathroom stall
They took his life cause he ain't want to take it off
Poor so hard, that shit cray, ain't it, Bey? Diabetics, fish filet
Poor so hard, your house so cold, nigga, it ain't spring
Every winter landlord fuckin' with my heat again

Fuck your French, we ain't in France, I'm just saying
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
If I was him, I'd put some black up in my family
Fake Gucci, my nigga, fake Louis, my killa
Real drugs, my dealer, who the fuck is Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest, I ain't got no insurance
It's them niggas in poorest, be them rebel guerillas, huh

I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Superheroes
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers
The three six oh-riginal sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time like Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peal out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but ock you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnhardt
Stay on the low like the herb spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, you hopefully
Mush on before you get bust off like a ovary

Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour

Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Cause they speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin
Speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin
Speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin, speedin
Relax
Slow down, you better chill, money
Lights be changing fast on these streets dude
Smash your whole shit up
You better cool out, money
It ain't like that out here
Look at these cats man, it's funny man
He probably just got that car
About to fuck your whole shit up
Speed laws out here, money
Knight riding cats
In control like interstaters, state-ahs, state-ahs
State-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs
State-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs, state-ahs
Stay the.. FUCK off the road, money!!",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-speed-law-lyrics
Sunshine,The New Danger,2004.0,"(Let the sun shine)
Yeah yeah its a brand new day y'all (Let the sunshine in)
Turn me up in the top a little bit dog
Little do you know, y'all gonna hear this one (The suns shinin')
Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen..

I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you motherfuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dog, Not to def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not the dude
I'm grown man business, and I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin' this is not for you
On my J.O. with beats by Kan-ye yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low

(Let the sun shine)
Standing in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am, Black Dante (Let the sunshine in)
That nigga, that dude
Black People, Lets Move (The suns shinin')
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli, yes
We on top-a top-a, shout-a shout-a
Check it out..

Slim nigga that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim, and more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, hail Mary, full of grace
Niggas come in and shoot up the place
And make you pull up your face
The deck, I'm a pull out the ace
From the jungles of the empire state
Where it ain't no escape, 247, 718
And thats like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the states, I'm collecting my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised

(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understanding me straight (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
Its what it is, what it is
And thats what it is, you see? (The suns shinin')
Ha, Fire..

Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic martyr figure
Brooklyn it don't matter if you holler or whisper
Your coming through clear, cause I'm right here wit'cha
Ain't gotta edit your slang, I got it, I get ya
Yo, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time that you get where I'm standing, I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move wrong

(Let the sun shine)
I move in, and y'all must move on
Cause I'm oh too strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)
Made it go without a brand new car
I was fresh without a brand new song
Don't give a fuck about what brand you are (The suns shining')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family y'all
No matter where your families are
Cause everybody needs family y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me y'all
Everybody needs family y'all
Be good to your families dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody needs family dog
Raise a hand, you understand me pa
Thats what it is...thats my man
Family and my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those who still in the struggle
Assata, Mumia, Sundiata, my man Jamil

Life is real
To all the real soldiers, black people (Let the sunshine in)

New World Water,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"There's nothing more refreshing (That cool refreshing drink)
Than a cool, crisp, clean glass of water
On a warm summer's day (That cool refreshing drink)
Try it with your friends

New World Water make the tide rise high
Come inland and make your house go ""Bye"" (My house!)
Fools done upset the Old Man River
Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead nigga
Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin
So I'mma throw a rope that ain't tied to nothin
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
It's the New World Water; and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it don't rain a full week some summers
And it's about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin bath
Heads is acting wild, sippin poor, puffin dank
Competin with the next man for higher playin rank
See I ain't got time try to be Big Hank
Fuck a bank; I need a twenty-year water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops burnin the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher
They say, ""Don't drink the water! We need it for the fire!""

New York is drinkin it (New World Water)
Now all of California is drinkin it (New World Water)
Way up North and Down South is drinkin it (New World Water)
Used to have minerals and zinc in it (New World Water)
Now they say it got lead and stink in it (New World Water)
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Push the water table lopside
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam cross the sea

Man, you gotta cook with it, bathe and clean with it (That's right)
When it's hot, summertime you fiend for it (Let em know)
You gotta put it in the iron you steamin with (That's right)
It's what they dress wounds and treat diseases with (Shout it out)
The rich and poor, black and white got need for it (That's right)
And everybody in the world can agree with this (Let em know)
Consumption promotes health and easiness (That's right)
Go too long without it on this earth and you leavin it (Shout it out)
Americans wastin it on some leisure shit (Say word?)
And other nations be desperately seekin it (Let em know)
Bacteria washing up on they beaches (Say word?)
Don't drink the water, son they can't wash they feet with it (Let em know)
Young babies in perpetual neediness (Say word?)
Epidemics hopppin up off the petri dish (Let em know)
Control centers try to play it all secretive (Say word?)
To avoid public panic and freakiness (Let em know)
There are places where TB is common as TV
Cause foreign-based companies go and get greedy
The type of cats who pollute the whole shore line
Have it purified, sell it for a dollar twenty-five

Now the world is drinkin it (New World Water)
Your moms, wife, and baby girl is drinkin it (New World Water)
Up North and Down South is drinkin it (New World Water)
You should just have to go to your sink for it (New World Water)
The cash registers is goin ""cha-chink!"" for it (New World Water)
Fluorocarbons and monoxide
Got the fish lookin cockeyed
Used to be free now it cost you a fee
Cause it's all about gettin that cash (Money)

Said it's all about gettin that cash (Money) (x9)

Rock and roll
(Huh) My grandmomma was raised on a reservation
(Huh) My great-grandmama was, from a plantation
They sang - songs for inspiration
They sang - songs for relaxation
They sang - songs, to take their minds up off that
Fucked up situation
I am, yes I am, the descendant (yes yes)
Of those folks whose, backs got broke
Who, fell down inside the gun smoke
(Black people!) Chains on their ankles and feet
I am descendants, of the builders of your street
(Black people!) Tenders to your cotton money
I am hip-hop
""
It's heavy metal for the black people
""
I am rock and roll (rock and roll, rock'n'roll)
Been here forever
They just ain't let you know (HA!)
I said, Elvis Presley ain't got no soul (huh)
Chuck Berry is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that style on they own (uh-uh)
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul (hell naw)
Little Richard is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that shit on they own (nah-ah)
Guess that's just the way shit goes
You steal my clothes and try to say they yours (yes they do)
Cause it's a show filled with pimps and hoes
Trying to take everything that you made or control (there they go)
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul
Bo Diddley is rock and roll (damn right)

I ain't tryin to slow your groove
But that ain't the way I'm trying to move
I don't turn on Korn to get it on;
I be playing Jimi Hendrix 'til the dawn
That's my word is bond
Sitting up on my front lawn
Got the volume turned to ten
Playing Albert King the best again (black)
When the morning in the cooker
Got to turn on some John Lee Hooker
When I want some rock and roll
Go to Otis Redding to get some soul
Say, James Brown got plenty of soul
James Brown like to rock and roll
He can do all the shit fo' sho'
That Elvis Presley could never know (black people)
Said, Kenny G ain't got no soul
John Coltrane is rock and roll (uh-huh)

If they think I'm gonna change or compromise
My attitude and my way of life or
In my expression or in my goal
Towards politics
They are making me stronger
And I am much more stronger now..

Bang to the boogy
Say upchuck the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
 
There it go like simple the plainness, it's primal and basic
Zulu arrangement rockin' amazement
Flaco, radiating from heaven to pavement
They phony as a face lift, I’m nothing to play with
Spent time hating it but that ain't changing it
God give it to me no body ain't takin' it
Therefore, moving on the base for stimulus
Standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
Walls, tremblin', the air, simmering
She movin' like more than her ears are listenin', whoa now
Testin' your equilibrium
Sonic wave booming all over your intimate
Skin on skin and skin on skin again
Put it all, get it all, get on get it in
Ladies and gentlemen, misters and mistresses
Cousins, uncles, aunties, and synonyms, there it is, boogieman
Hah
Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now x3
Quiet dog, bite hard
 my god
Said and the rocket don't stop
Brooklyn in the kitchen heat up the stove top
Bey in the empire state and navigating the way
Preservation makes the greatest hip hop
The cool dudes swagger they terribly corny
The flow so petty,unsteady, it's boring
These dudes ain't dope but they on it
They need to get off it, so ""wack wack"" is all you can call it
Therefore, movin on to Def for stimulus
Regardless of what zone, what town you represent
A bullet 
into all your settlements
Tower to tenement
I mold through for all of the element
Simmer down
I manage your mayhem
I'm bright as the AM
Engine 'bout to roll out the station
I'm blessed with the fresh from day one
I got it from day done
We all going back to the same one
It's the cost of motivation I'll stay with
Remarkable flavors
That all bear the mark of the greatness
Woah now
Is to get us to buck town
Your girl is in love now
You chumps don’t want to get shut-down

Simmer down simmer down simmer down now
Simmer down now x3

A Message from Yasiin Bey [via Kanye West],UnKnown,2016.0,"Peace, this is Yasiin

No more parties in SA
Please, tell 'em no more parties in SA

Ain't home arrest, I don't need to stay
I'll leave and I'll stay away
I committed no crime any place
Why these police up in my face?
Why they raiding my place?
Why I don't feel safe?
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
My intentions are pure in coming here
And that's for everything I love or hold dear
Umi's in the building
So is my wife and my children
I committed no crime
Why is the state wasting my time?
They must be out of their minds
I forgive 'em, that's the spirit of divine
I just wanna go where I'm wanted
Where I'm loved, stop frontin'
Where I live is my choice, you cannot mute my voice
Thank you, Kanye West, for being a real friend, a real friend
A real friend

No more parties in SA
Please, no more parties in SA

I heard your choice the first time, I'll go away
And when I leave, that's exactly where I'll stay
This is not an expression of fear
This is just to make things clear
A country called Earth, everywhere
A country called Earth, everywhere

No more parties in SA
Please, no more parties in SA
That's just a freestyle; I had to let that out. Peace to all, fear none, this is Yasiin Bey. At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I'm being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They're saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they're making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it's not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation's state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they're there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I've made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I'm under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I'm being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It's curious. I haven't broken any law, and I'm being treated like a criminal. I know I'm not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I'm here with my family. I haven't been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily. There's no reason I have to spend any time in the cell. There's no reason I had to have police come to my house, damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport, where nobody arrested me, and none of that ever happened, at all. This is not an administration of justice, and all I seek is to leave the state. I'm not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing, because I'm not- I just wanna go home, and I don't live in America, and I have the right to domicile wherever I please, without fear or without interference
The state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we’re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just…you know, a money making machine. So, it’s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um…and that's that
Peace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's…I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all
In summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen
And I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and…and…and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach. Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to my brother Talib Kweli, salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Islam, all of the Zulu Nation. The Zulu Nation real here; there's real Zulus. My brother, Siyabonga, the Madlalas. All of the people here who have supported me: this is no reflection on you. I love the people of this country. I love this continent. I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem. But I'll end with this verse that I wanna put on ""No More Parties in LA,"" if you would kindly allow me, my dear brother Kanye. And shout out to K. Lamar, too; I see you, my dude

History,The Ecstatic,2009.0,"Kweli say, ""Everybody act according to the season that they born in""
Some are the night, some are the morning, some at noon
Some in winter, some in June
It's our code, it's the natural
The science is a jewel
For me and mines, yours and you
Let's move, tell you a little about mine, yo

I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad, feelings pass and change
But they never leave, they here to stay
Holiday, holiday, happy birthday
Teenage love, the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh, this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox, seven and three
M.D., the history (come on)
Every soul's got one of these (yes)
It's where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete, the start and the end
Then it just go round again

Again and again, brand new
Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

I was born in the decade of decadence where they worship what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like, bye; we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where the hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

And don't call it comeback in particular
We will never blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral, transition of the minister's original
We're broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star so tight, burning soul temperatures and ministers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures
It's miracle material, remember it's right now foreverness",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-history-lyrics
Know That,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"I Strike the Empire Back
I Strike the Empire Back
Fuck the Empire
High flying like the Millenium Falcon
Piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo, fronting on me's a no-no
Understand, doing this for my family
Ha ha, check it out y'all

Yo I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin the North beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs, and it goes
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man, because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano
Kweli is you with me (What up, what up)
Let's make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow looking for a brighter day
When y'all wanna leave y'all
Right away
Shout it out from East-West (from South to Northern)
From Cackalack (to California)
From the coldest (to the warmest)
To the borders ('cross the waters) understand..
"".. and know that I love you..""
We got love in the place
Shout out to all the Queens (all the Seeds)
To all the teams (that's gettin cream)
From outlaw (to emcees)
Make it happen (do your thing) understand..
"".. and know that I love you..""
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen

Guess who
The illest MC in the atmosphere
Yeah the Soul Controller
Who roam the frontier like a Buffalo Soldier
I follow the code of honor like a real man gonna
Never disrespect no women cause I love my momma
These cats be giving us praise but it ain't that accurate
I give it up to God, all that love and attachment get
Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to em clearly
Y'all don't hear me though, even when I'm coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo, why you starting me
I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent, with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
MCs imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off
You come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it, MCs in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know it's only cause I love you

Shout it out from East-West
(From South to Northern)
From the richest (to the poorest)
To the elders (in the coffins)
Living native (dying for it) understand
And know that I love you
Yea, yea, we got love in the place
Shout out from up top (to the middle)
To black bottom (sky high!)
Whether you colder than December
Or hotter than July
It don't stop til we complete this
And know that I love you
Keep this fly
It's so much to life when you just
Stay black

Beef,Mos Definite,2012.0,"Beef is not what Jay said to Nas
Beef is when the working folks can't find jobs
So they trying to find niggas to rob
Trying to find bigger guns so they can finish the job
Beef is when the crack babies can't find moms
Cause they in a pine box, or locked behind bars
Beef ain't the summer jam for Hot 9-7
Beef is the cocaine and AIDS epidemic
Beef don't come with a radio edit
Beef is when the judge is callin' you defendant
Beef: It come with a long jail sentence
Handed down to you in a few short minutes
Beef is when your girl come through for a visit
To tell you that she pregnant, by some other nigga
Beef is high blood pressure and bad credit
Need a loan for your home but you're too broke to get it
And all your little kids is doing is getting bigger
You're trying not to raise 'em around these wild niggas
Beef is when a gold digger got your seed in her
A manicure handout like, ""Pay me nigga!""
Or I'm telling your wife
Or starting up some foul rumor that'll ruin your life
Beef is when a gangsta ain't doing it right
And other gangstas is deciding what to do with his life
Beef is not what these famous niggas do on the mic
Beef is what George Bush would do in a fight
Beef is what Ja said to 50
But beef is all my homies not being here with me
When a soldier ends his life with his own gun
Beef is trying to figure out what to tell his son
Beef is oil prices and geopolitics
Beef is Iraq, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Some beef is big and some beef is small
But what ya'll call beef is not beef at all
Beef is real life happening every day
And it's realer than them songs you gave to Kayslay

You're out on the block hustling at the spot
GOT, this is how you get Got
At the gamblin' spot and your hand is mad hot
GOT, this is how you get Got
Out in Brooklyn late night flashing all of your rocks
GOT, this is how you get Got
Some girl from pink house said ""I like you a lot""
GOT, this is how you get Got

This one goes to all them Big Will cats
With ice on they limbs and big rims on they Ac
You goin' around town with your system bump
And your windows cracked low to profile and front
Now I like to have nice things just like you
But I'm from Brooklyn, certain shit you just don't do
Like, high postin' when you far from home
Or like, high postin' when you all alone
Now, this would seem to be clear common sense
But cats be livin' off sheer confidence
Like ""Fuck that, picture them tellin' me run that""
But acting invincible, just ain't sensible
It's nineteen ninety-now, and there's certain individuals
Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle
5 star general, flashin' on your revenue
You takin' a ride on the Downstate medical, Like (whooooooo)
Colorful sparks, yellow and blue
A full on attack and it's happening to you
Wit' nothing you can do but bust back and cop a plea
But five of them and one of you, that equals Got to me

Come on ya'll now, let's be real
Some jokers got a rough time keepin' it concealed
I wonder what it mean, it's probably self-esteem
They fiendin to be seen, get hemmed like Gabardines
Cats think it can't happen until the gats start clappin
They comin' down the wire spittin fire like a dragon
Cause while the goods glisten, certain eyes take position
To observe your trickin', then catch that ass slippin'
Like, come on now ock, what you expect?
Got a month's paycheck danglin' off your neck
And while you Cristal sippin', they rubbin' up they mittens
With heat in mint condition to start the getti-gettin'
They clique starts creepin' like Sandinista guerrillas
You screamin' playa haters, these niggas is playa killers
Mr. Fash-ion, that style never last long
The harder you flash, the harder you get flashed on
There's hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
Many steal for sport, but more steal to eat
Cat's heavy at the weigh-in, and he's playin' for keeps
Don't sleep, they'll roll up in your passengers seat
There is universal law, whether rich or poor
Some say life's a game, to more, life is war
So put them egos to the side and get off them head trips
'Fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless

Life In Marvelous Times,The Ecstatic,2008.0,"Bright moments, bright moments always come back vivid
The fifth grade was epic city-wide test pressure
The pre-crack era
Mr. Schumer, what a prick
Attitude match his wardrobe, uglier than sin
This is 
Bed-Stuy
 
eighty-two
Ninth floor, three tiny rooms, one view
Bucktown, 
Roosevelt House
Their green grass is green; our green grass is brown
Shots rang, my phone wasn't touch tone
Were heavy beef in the street, E.T. had to flee
Great heavens, good grief
Hungry bellies, bright gold on their teeth
The windows on the Ave look like sad eyes
They fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
And if you dare to stand, you can see 'em cry
You can watch 'em scowl, feel 'em prowl
While they're steady sizing every inch about you
Fast math measuring what you amount to
The laughter, the screams
The numeral, the song of songs, the book of dreams
Ends don't meet where the arms can't reach
Mean streets,
 
even when it's free it ain't cheap
On-going saga, terminal diagnosis
Basic survival requires super heroics
No space in the budget for a cape
Assume you gotta fly by night to save the day
Crash-landings routinely happen
Some survive, others never rise from the ashes
Watching asphalt and observing the 
Sabbath
Creates an Ecstatic and there you have it
From teenage love praying in tongue
Strange fruit
, batty boots and native drums
From hence I come, so here we go
Signs and wonders all along the road
Some lies open, some lies closed
Some stretchers role with no lies at all
Some riders don't know what they ridin' for
Hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
Wherever you ride, whatever your lane
This road called life is a beautiful thing
And we are alive in amazing times
Delicate hearts, diabolical minds
Revelations, hatred, love and war
And more and more and more and more
And more of less than ever before
It's just too much more for your mind to absorb
It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt
We can't be alive in no time but NOW
It's just another shot to the heart
It's just a sure shot in the dark
It's just another place in the stars
Wonders on every side, life in marvelous times

Pouring liquor on the day you was born

Habitat,Black on Both Sides,1999.0,"(Chorus)
We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
We set out on our travels, we do the best we can
We travel this big earth as we roam
We all got to have, a place where we come from
This place that we come from is called home
And even though we may love, this place on the map
Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at

I come up in the street around some real wild brothers
With more than one name and more than one baby mother
More than one case, been on more than one run
Got more than one enemy and more than one gun
Partner, all that's left to want is more
While these cats that's less privileged is just more raw
Less space cause the projects laced with more flaws
Less sleep cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war
The can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps
On the block with your old pop pleading number act
To the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
To the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
With the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs
For gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba
And dominate the weaker on the street
Hungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete
When they smile with your heart in they teeth
And the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
Son I been plenty places in my life and time
And regardless where home is, son home is mine

Some people live out in-New York City
Some people live out in-Atlanta
Some people got to live-Chicago
Some people do live-Miami
All my people at-California
And other people got to live-London
And everybody got to live in the whole big world
Together just you and me

When I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning
Laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
Chillin in front my building with my brother and them
Spending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them
Wise town and Beat Street, federal relief
Slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
Sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
With every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece
Old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
Telling tales about they used to be involved in things
Start to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out
On the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out
And it's all too common to start wildin
I'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
And it's hard to find
Block parties in dark lobbies
Funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
I can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley
Marley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall
Son I been to many places in my space and time
And whatever my home is, son home is mine",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-habitat-lyrics

Hungry hands only take when they reaching out

Ugly politicians, new election year
Crying bout their care, they are not sincere
It's the greedy and the rich ones that make war

In the land where crooks get to write the laws
But people hide their eyes, and shut their jaws
Who the realest? Never mind
Who doing it for the best, there ain't lies
What they wearing, who is there?
Ask yourself, why you care?
Somebody going ham on a gossip site
Catching feelings over rumors that are not your life
I don't like, sometimes I even hate
But not the people, they acts and ways
I don't like, sometimes I even hate

For pussy posers, dummy greed

Called dreams, in the sky of life

When...all...is...said...and...done...there's...only...one
Cash and carry, legendary, Sagitarri, style's vary
And it's very necessary get it clearly
Never scary barely worried bright and early
Bald head straight or curly mundane or other worldly
No chain, nada jewelry that jackers can't snatch
The gingerbread the slave masters can't catch
Blat! Now put your minds on that
Get real or get back quit frontin face facts
The old timers say we're living in the final days
Gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
Gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways
Meanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates
Crash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age
Access is instant and treachery is commonplace
I sense the dangers and I'm not afraid
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE
Man up playboy playing the game boy
Pull back spectacular aim boy
Say what you say boy whoever could make noise
And ride range off in the same voice
Conduct an arrangement with definite language
It's pure inspiration for this generation
Speak true free love
Because when all is said and done there's only ONE
And the one can done so cool
Schooling the young like Rev. Run (""whose house?"")
Quote Pac and tell 'em keep their heads up
And when the pressure comes down press back and press up
Fret not ghetto world guess what
God is on your side the devil is a lie (alive?)
The Empire holds all the gold and the guns
But when all is said and done there's only...

This is your captain speaking, with just a little flight information
Coming up on the left we're going to be catching a glimpse of the Grand Canyon
On the right you can be able to see the Hoover Dam
In just a a few minutes. We're flying at an altitude of 37,000 feet
And our air speed is four hundred miles an hour...
Couple a little facts here, I'm packing a Colt King Cobra
That's a .357 caliber firearm with a black rubber-grip and a six inch barrel
Also, the co-pilot is carrying a Kimber Custom defense pistol with all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a custom gun of that kind with an alloy frame and bevel treatment on the entire gun
And our Chief Flight Attendant Roger has a uh Ruger Bearcat, that .22 with a hand-fluted cylinder
All three are capable of piercing body
Armor at a distance of up to twenty-seven feet and you can put a hole
In human bone and flesh the size of the Grand Canyon, which
By the way is coming up on the left hand side of the plane, so just
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the rest of your flight...""

A Bible, a Qur'an in a drawer

Tend to whisper through the walls
She was calling on God

Reservations, exclusive arrangements
Dinner with the patrons, the scenery is amazing
It's so outrageous, they whisper when they say it
When it's really real it's even realer than ""The Matrix""

Then where should you stand to begin with?
And when the falling's done
How bad should you plan to get injured?
And if you land on your feet
Do it count as a fall or a jump?
And do it feel like a fall
When the hands that pushed you were holding you up?
Close encounter, got you wide open
Heartache got your boom-box going
Music and vocals, lonely and soulful
Your back at the scene where your sweet dreams sold you

Believe me when I tell you
I never meant to break your heart
May God pick up the pieces
Of dreams that fall apart
Forgive me and forget me
Make a brand new start
Don't blink your eyes and say goodbye

The Universal Magnetic,The Universal Magnetic / If You Can Huh! You Can Hear,1997.0,"Yeah, ha ha ha
A-B-boys rock the world
CD's and tapes help generate papes
E-F is the end part of Def
G-good, H is what style be
When I grab the microphone and MC
Roll off the tongue like L-M-N-O-P
And when I am done you will agree
Mos Def represent most definitely
Jeans is what I used to rock in '83
Drank up all the Kool-Aid at the block party
Used to wish I could break with Rock Steady
Watched Tenspeed and Brown Shoe on TV
But now it's not dis and it's on like this
My name is Mos Def, this is good as it gets
Baby I make you rub your mitts like sardines and grits
My shit still hit, even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
Even when the record skip
I don't quit, I don't quit
We 'bout to make this one the sure hit
Shawn J. make the party people feel it
(Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to introduce a very
Interesting young man that has traveled from very far
Away to be with us tonight)
There is such a place that creates such a melody
Brooklyn! Go ladies!
It's a living dream, it's a living dream, it's a living dream
Love like this!

Recognize all area crew
Whether you speak Japanese or Goonie Goo Goo
Son when I come through, other rappers boo-hoo
Cause they know they style's soft like baby doo-doo
I will continue to hit like a fifth of Stolichnaya
Putting jokers on ice to get the cream like Breyers
No secret, Mos Def is the one the hons admire
I get in my stance and set the dance on fire
Spread out my wings and I take the world higher
Peace to the fam magnetic in the Chi
Jah Born, Top Sean and my man Ato
And all my other clan who reside in the Zoo
Got the celebrated oatmeal broadcast brew
Mos Def gon' keep it naked like Umfufu (Eddie!)
Words adhere to the tape like crazy glue
So when they bounce out of speakers they stick to you
The way that I communicate is non-typical
But eye level like a 3-D visual
I hold the mic extension, exhibit level and dimension
And radiate the space like a upright bass
Yo son I leave crews laced and escape with no trace
Sound official like the finish time at a horse race
Here to put it in place, for the nine-uno-seis
Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase

Raise your hands in the air, everybody get with it
Universal Magnetic B-Boy, scientific
It's like that and you don't stop
It go on to the rhythm you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get with it
The Universal Magnetic B-Boy!
Scientific y'all, you don't stop
It go on to the rhythm you don't stop

Baby it's in my chromosomes to rock microphone sets
Who wanna test the M-O-S just leave that shit alone
I make no bones or poems about dropping bars
Make the world fall sway under the Mos Def, yes
I ring the alarm like Tenor Saw
My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor
And you should go and tell your clientele
That they need to get the message like Melle Mel
I got the shit on lock like a death row cell
And if I ain't a b-boy, Premier never used a bell (ding ding)
So tell your poor ass crew to retire
Before I make they ass catch fire like Richard Pryor
Non-descriptive fiending for riches, calling Earths bitches
But most of y'all brothers is living with your mothers
The boogie man yanking up your covers
Sharper than some new box cutters, on Parkay's and butters
And Stevie Wonder's, to make you run and tell the others
The beat lovers, and play my jam like the numbers
Son I rock the globe like I rocked your boat
I'm 'bout to tap it on your shoulder cause you got to know",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-the-universal-magnetic-lyrics

Fresh and I'm fresh and my fresh just get fresher
Diamonds in production glow greater than the pressure
The none turn to some and the some turn to more
The more turn to many and the many turn to all
Shoutin' all or nothing like it's nothing at all
Do not kno' what ya got til it got gone
Same song, new time signature
New brand hustle with the long time arithmetic
Bey, from the preacher man, number man, understand
Curves and sliders, overs and under-hands
Black Batman, knock em out the park
Pitch, quiet fire sniper not the one you tryna box with
Block work when the block turn jobless
And triple beams ain't the best means to weigh your options
Smarts!, get smart with your smartness
Too busy surviving to argue 'bout Darwin....Darling!

Me, Sugar Ray and Ali pretty dancer
See me do it, (echo)

Yo Yo! Don't play me so close
Make me tell you something that you ain't really ready to know
Fight camp you was in top form
Fight night, damn you ain't breakin' popcorn
Aw man word bond?
Word is bond! Ultimatum
Lights off, smelling salts resuscitate em
I don't underrate em son, I don't nothing-rate em
All I do is pop pop, frustrate em
Exacerbate em, sharp shoot, lacerate em
Steady hustle, shuffle shuffle, fascinate em

I come home high and she start to cry
I can't take it..
A brand new excuse does me no use
That won't make it..
She be home with the kids, this is no way to live
What can I say?
I know it's surreal but I'm a hard headed still
Do things my way..
And it's so strong, soo strong
It's like I'm dying..
Trying to hold on, my body says oh no oh out there..
Flying, the price that I pay for the game that I play
Ain't no game at all..
I'm up in the clouds and I'm spiraling down
Nothing breaks the fall..
And it's so strong, so strong
It's like I'm dying..
Try to hold on, my body says oh no oh out there
Flying..
Sounds of the sufferers pray
I come home high and she start to cry
I can't take it..
A brand new excuse does me no use
That won't make it..
She at home with the kids, this is no way to live

I know it's surreal but I'm a hard headed still

Head in her hands
Her first born son dead in her hands
The whole thing was a setup, a scam
They knew it was set up and planned
Niggas he worked with wet him and ran, and that's..
Brother, Brother...
But son, I don't see no brother hood
All I see is thugger hood
Get rich and fuck the hood
All they want is some good smoke from the hood
Lookin for the shorty good stroke from the hood
That's how they touch the hood
But when I touch the hood, I'll make it brighter, black
Because I'm brighter, black
And I'm so black I'm bright, shine through the blackest night
Shine when I'm live, shine via satellite
Shout in the hood, we get the picture
Cuz everytime you out in the hood, you got photographers witcha
What's going on? Ha!
Understand this is real life..
This how it goes on, this how it goes on...
It keep going on, this how it goes on...
Ghetto people look alive, get free
Get involved, remain to breathe...Ha! Wooh!
If Marvin was alive now, wow..
What would I say to him?
Where could I start?
How could I explain to him??
I know the minor world would probably look strange to him
Would he feel like today had a place for him?
Global imprisonment, sickness, indifference
When he said, ""Save the babies,"" was we listenin?
When he said, ""Mercy, mercy,"" did he really know..
That decades later we'd still be killin folks?
Or did he hope that we would realize..
That we the first, the son of earth..
The moon and stars, the great beyond..
We black and proud, we brave and strong..
We raise it up, we quiet storm, forever fresh..
And keepin on..?
Ha! Ghetto people look alive and free, ya get real..
This how it goes on, and you say you say
This how it goes on, and you say you say
This how it goes on..
Ghetto people look alive and free and breathe! Ha!

Hold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!
Hold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!

My voice like magic, my flow fantastic
In summary I'm rare, ordinary, elaborate

Don't let bullshit knock you off your grind
And that's real talk for all of mine and for all of yours

Tap tap and break down the wall, collect and count it all

Blow up the sights like they 
Blow valley survivor, rider or driver

You're the one!

Other fuckas just don't know
You got to feel me on this one man
So real, I'm so sin-serious about it, you know?
I know more than a few is gon' relate
So much more than a few for really real
So much more (On the really real!)

When it started I knew it was trouble
But you know me, them ""hard and everythings"" can't hold me
I need some shit straight out the movies
Drama, warm to the touch, hot mama
Put me all in like launch jeans and scama
You was Mrs. Mine, so fine
Went from ""we gon' conquer it all""
To ""nigga I'mma see you in court""
I woulda never thought, I guess I better think again
Ok, now the shit is really sinkin' in
We ain't just divorced, we ain't even fucking friends
Cause in the end it was all about the ends
But fuck that I know it gotta be more to it
Held up with bitter hate with crosses all through it
And when I looked, what did I see?
You on the other end crying like me
Expression on your face like, ""How could this be?""
That's what I'm asking, ""What the fuck happened?""
How could all the magic and passion just vanish
Went from outsanding to making me shout, ""Dammit!""
Can't explain the changes, behavior's is outlandish
Now I'm just stuck in the road feeling stranded
I'm in the dark wishing for the answers
On some old Biggie give me one more chance shit
When we met your face so brown
Your ass so round, of course I'm so down
Wish I knew then what the fuck I know now
Couldn't read the signs in the road: ""Slow down!""
I'm too deep in the road now
Got me pulling over getting smoked out
Fighting tears that I can't hold down
Can't believe it, this fucka's got me weeping
I keep it a secret so my friends won't peep it
But late in the evening I'm up, my chest heaving
I'm reaching in the dark and I'm looking for the reason
Why? Did our love have to die? You and I were so fucking fly
Can't get it off my mind, the things that made me smile now make me cry

You are the one
You're the one! Fuck you!

I wish we never met, I wish we never kissed
I wish we never touched (Swear to God)
I wish I didn't love you so much
I wish I could forget how feel, how you f..
That's a lie, the shit that made me smile, now make me cry

You are the one
You're the one! Fuck you!

Sometime I wish we'd come back
Man, I wish we'd come back (Memories!)
No lie, for real? Fuck that
No, for real
It's a dangerous necessity
It's a world famous mystery, love
That's it, peace!",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-u-r-the-one-lyrics

Work is scarce, competition is fierce
Fonzi frontin' in the new leather like they don't care
Word, let's get you an award for that performance
Winner in the category for the best boring
Uh, tell the tough guys we tougher than tough times
And needles in the nerves to make the tighten up unwind
One time, for locking out the light in your eyes
You're searching for your perfect one
Broken down from getting it all to take it however it comes
Plain day, you the specialest one, oh me, oh my

I'll give you all the milk and the honey
But you can't break my heart
Cause that'll just get you fired
Sloppy worker get your pay grade bust

Work is scarce, skilled working is rare
Fonzi fronting at the job site, primping up they hair
Word, well tell them only staff could drink they coffee
Walking papers at the office, sleep late tomorrow morning
Tell the tough guys we tougher than tough times
And nerves don't snap when the clock touch crunch time
That's right we tougher than tough times
From been narrowing, to the clock just unwind
For sure we tougher than tough times
My proof don't need to lie, my tighten up don't unwind
Sunshine, lifting up the light in your eyes
You're gazing at your perfect one
Broken down from never at all to better than you could ever want
Great day I know that you had to come, oh me oh my

I'll give you all the diamonds and money
But you can't break my heart
Cause that'll just get you fired
And you're doing such a beautiful job",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-workers-comp-lyrics

And from the moment that I saw ya, I knew you was trouble
But I disregarded, detour signs
And did not stop til you was mine
I guess God was like, aight fine
Careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it in heaps
Try to give it back he be like - nah that's yours to keep
So poetic baby girl you make it hard to speak
My dream lover make it hard to sleep
.. I wrote a little song about it
In she came with the same type game
The hairdo, Prada shoes, brand new Gucci frame
Big thangs, so big you can't hardly explain
When she done crossed her legs, she make mind turn insane
Had seen her on the ave and spotted her, how I wanted her
Ass so fat she think police tryna follow her
What you lo-lo-love, expert in the bedwork corridor
Man see a touches her, man you'll feel sorry for
Hustlers, bubblers, jugglers, sufferers
All wanna know what her name and phone number was
They're spendin up their money like, post them up and touch her up
But it don't (?) tough, X-amount of (?)
Son, bwoy, African and tough, all nice and decent
A-yeah yeah, I'm tryin to ride with a diamond like you
Lookin pretty in the club, plus she love Mos and Wu

Ass wide and fat, breasts mad, hair wrapped
Wilma style, chunky, that's how I like my batch
You a rose from the hood, smoked out of 89
We headed back, you had a baby by Ron
But that's irrelevant, bygones is bygones
Calgon is Calgons, love it when you jump in Ghost thongs
Steppin out of B-B-Q's
'Member when we licked the cream out of Suzy Q's?
Spaghetti jewels, the big word on the street
You like Millie Jackson in the new Mack flick carryin heat
Or say with Oprah with a makeover, Billie Jean slash Dairy Queen
Fantasy is, can I eat you on the swing?
See it's written all over my face, Daily News
Big bold lettered, front page, Starks how it taste?

Watch out! Louisana jug wine and conk out
Throw her hands high and make her backside pop out
Watch out! If you don't have the V.I.P. lacq' out
Them big dollars they talk 'bout, just turn around and walk out
You better watch out! Exotic fabrics, speech in larynx
Think it's mid-day traffic, runnin game like the Mavericks
Makin time seem elastic when we stretch out and smash it
Then vanish like a phantom and hurt my understandin like WHAT??

From the East to the West, son, we take it to the chest say we
(Don't stop the Body Rock)

Check me out y'all
I'm in the lab with Ab, I got the pen and pad
My man T-A-S-H 
take it to yo' breastplate
It's the Mighty Mos Def, complete the trilogy
Just shot myself a dime
, see are you feeling me?
Son I'm wicked and nice when I'm on facility
Let me take a sec to review what I wrote
.. ""Mos Def and does it sound far fetched?"" OK it's dope
Let's record this ('cord this) they gonna award this (award this)
And all area crew is gonna applaud this {*clapping*}
And when we step to the plate Pah it's flawless
My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great
Great, great great, great great

Up next we got CaTash with that West coast rhyming
Bombing niggas with the style as dangerous as mountain climbing
 (ahhhhhhh)
Cause the Alkie words I'm spitting be twisting while you listening
Plus I'm in this motherfucker with the Likwit coalition
 (woo)
That'll leave you in position, twisted backwards like yoga
While you staring down my throat like, ""Is he drunk or is he sober?""
(Who knows?!)
 All I know is Tash got flows (woo)
And got the technique to get the ladies out of they clothes
I been overly exposed to the 
forty-oh's and chickens
So I'mma keep it pumping til the beat stop kicking
Or til the plot thickens, cause this is how we do
CaTashtrophe, Mos Def, and the brother man Q!

What's up Tash, hey yo, Tip can't call it
Sure as Mos is Def 
and you Alkaholik

I'mma be surfing at, thing that's worth dealing (uh-huh)
Hypodermically, shoot up your feeling (uh)
Figuratively speaking, of course, now (right)
Old and greediness seeking it's course now (uh)
What we gonna do? Eradicate them
Shoot them from the jam, they be diseased phlegm

Tash Love... are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-Tip... are you ready to rock the mic!

Don't stop, the Body Rock!

Cause I'm next to flex,
 and I'm technically advanced
To turn you on like cybersex, so in less (uh) than two sec's (uh)
I blind MC's like Thomas Dolby with the Science that'll leave
They braincells fryin slowly (SCIENCE!) so slowly I flow and
Express written consent, from the undergroundin niggas
Coast II Coast I represent cause gettin bent, I do
But I'm doper than sherm plus the way I put it down
Could burn the perm off Big Worm
, so peep this private screening
Of the Last Action Hero 
that be freezin rappers dead in they tracks
Like Sub Zero (Zero)
, cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat yo' flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up

Yo what you skied up or treed up?
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like Tiger Woods about to tee up
So niggas no competition with the clear Mos Definition
MC's screamin now for years can't rhyme without they mom's permission
You just a young'un comin out, gettin gassed to run your mouth
Wildin on the Runabout, Baby Pah you comin out
Barkin that you want a bout but son you know the comeabout
When Mos Def blow up and, you don't, nuttin
Don't you know nuttin? My crew go huntin
We keep it on the norm then we transform som'in
And while, we do it, you bounce to it
The cops wanna stop the Body Rock (but don't do it)

DY-NO-MITE!!! Like Jimmy J.J
Slobbed down pen-ny, somewhere in L.A. (A)
Now we got to 
bond like Voltron

Grown Man Business (Fresh Vintage Bottles),The New Danger,2004.0,"Hear Me, See Me
Welcome to Soundview Projects
Bronx New York, 10473
Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman
Loose mamis fucking, they definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the corner's younger
I smell feel touch and taste they hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggas wanna be Pistol Pete -without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death
Don't my boy live to retrace my steps
Minne- stay safe move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with It
Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly
Sex money and boss
My ties to hear me see me
True villain
Face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey
Took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold
Get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
Son stop over here(?), you looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game
Grand child hosing sims
Put the heroin in queens
Put Pops Freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor
Cover the smell of the raw
Chess moves like Barksdale, my connects untimely
King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's
03 scene MVP and one Accord
Boss makes decision paper wins awards

See Me, Hear Me
Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206
Roosevelt Projects, wild rose water the plant
Son you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me
I'm gonna show you some shit
Ima show you where my niggas stay sure on the mix
Ima show you where the pain and the poetry is
Ghetto young'ns spend a lot of time alone in the crib
BET on the screen, walls and posters of BIG
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk
Still down to load up they clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
This how it happens, good people, bad habits, diabetics, crack addicts
Asthmatics
Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet
The bible, the Q uran, or the ten crack commandments
Speak on it God, What's today's mathematics
The five day forecast, the Dow Jones average
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers
Life is a test and we all got the answer
The streets keep calling its hard not answer
And on my government-my attribute-my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
(?) We do not fuck around
That's what it is (All Day)
That's what is Niggas (Official, Official)
That's how it is Niggas

Champion Requiem,The New Danger,2004.0,"Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem
Peace, peace whats up y'all this is Mos Def
And this is a message to the people
If you see or hear goodness from me
Then that goodness is from The Creator
You should be thankful to The Creator for all of that
Cause I'm not the architect of that
I'm only the, the recipient
If you see weakness or shortcoming in me
It's from my own weakness or shortcoming
And I ask The Creator and the people to forgive me for that
Thank you Brooklyn, thank you world
Yeah, yeah there it is, turn my voice up in the top a little bit
It feel good to be back, what's up ochenta
It's the Black Dante in your headphones
Speakerbox, freaky radio
Everywhere on the dial, tell you a little bit about me
For my hometown, break down a little history for you
Myrtle and Broadway, Roosvelt projects, Marcy projects
Listen

I stepped on the field from no league, just home team
I Jumped out the stands and I snatched the rock
With the final seconds one, two, land on the clock
Mos post up to throw up the tie-breakin' shot
I put it through the net and let the world's jaw drop
Then fled the arena before they called cops
Tell the players and the coach I wasn't tryin to blow spot
But the way they was ballin' made it difficult to watch
I was taught when there's somethin' you can change around
Keep quiet, you got nothin' to complain about
You got work to do, I don't know if that work for you
But thats how Mos work it through
And my work is personal, I'm a workin person
I put in work, I work with purpose
I get it there, on the water, air, the surface
You feel the impact, niggas yeah it's workin
Listen God did not make me a fearful person
The only fear I have, Is my failure to adhear his path
I would love it just to hear this back
On the ghetto streets where y'all at
On the ave's where the Jeep's go past
In the coupes where the seats go back
In the parties where it be so packed
And the atmosphere be so black
And them black things be so phat
If I could I would be so glad
But if not I won't be so mad
I'm still being a man, still feeding my fam
And even if you don't see it my fam
I believe that I am, truly gifted, truly blessed
I'm yours truly, Brooklyn's own, Mos Def
I'm rockin the hard right, ground zero, to far left
I'm, well balanced, with immense talents
Burn the script, then flip it to keep myself challanged
And thats the mark of a true champ-ine
Thats whether I'm in or outside the ring
No fights, no tilte, no crown or reign
Feel my presence even when I'm up out this thing
Just trust, thats what I'm about to be
But until then settle in and rock with me

Ha, thats what its about to be
Ghetto people look alive with me
And say, We 'gon, stop by
Then we just keep movin on
Ghetto people, look alive and
Feel free, we just keep movin on
For Aaliyah, Left Eye, Jam Master Jay
All the great hero's who have passed away
Scott Laraque, BIG and Pac, Feaky Tah, Big L
All the soldiers locked down in the cell
Lock up the flesh, but the spirit will prevail
To our loved ones, and deceased
Dyin' in the street, or quiet in their sleep, BIG
Rest in peace, your livin' in the mansions of our memory
Rest in peace, your livin' in the mansions of our memory
And that's real, cause everything in life 'gon come to an end
Because it must, and when it does
I hope that y'all remember me with true respect
And ghetto love, now raise it up
Cause everythin in life 'gon come to an end
Because it must, and when it does
I hope that y'all remember me

Dollar Day,True Magic,2006.0,"So there's a story about the lady in Louisiana
She's a flood survivor and the rescue teams
They come through, and they, I guess tryna recover people
And they see this women she's wadin through the streets
I guess it'd been some time after the storm
And I guess they were shocked that you know she was alive
And rescue worker said, ""So, oh my God h-how did you survive
How did you do it? Where've you been?""
And she said, ""Where I been? Where you been?""
Hah, Where you been? You understand?
That's about the size of it

And Mr. President he bout that cash
He got a policy for handlin the niggas and trash
And if you poor you black
I laugh a laugh they won't give when you ask
You better off on crack
Dead or in jail, or with a gun in Iraq
And it's as simple as that
No opinion my man it's mathematical fact
Listen, a million poor since 2004
And they got -illions and killions to waste on the war
And make you question what the taxes is for
Or the cost to reinforce, the broke levee wall
Tell the boss, he shouldn't be the boss anymore

Fake Bonanza,True Magic,2006.0,"This is a revolutionary sureshot

Hip hop, modern time, flossy and raw so self-absorbed, immature
I can't remember being this bored
Fake bonanzas become come real wars
Bullets burn through the candy on the driver side door
Long investigations and no firm lead
Billion dollar flow, and black life is still cheap
Your rent skyrockets and job prospects plummet
Ten murders, ten days, this summer
Talk about today's mathematics
A eighth, a O, a key of the calibre on your ratchet
The inmate number, the centerfold’s measurements
Is close as a cold cell come to some tenderness
I heard them say it was all about the Benjamins
I don't believe it now, didn't believe it then
Fuck whatchu heard, you believe whatchu want
The truth is what it is, it be what it been
Get rich, shorty just tryna live
Don't believe in heaven and ain't tryna get in
And hell is everyday, fuck the world anyway
Potion and sips, spark up a clip, fade away!

The low lights, tree top heights
Be careful how you move the traps are covered in the lights
Landmines be disguised as welcome signs
I'll repeat it so you ain't got to press rewind
The landmines be disguised as welcome signs
Black fresh from Iraq, a wild look in his eyes
Missing part of his arm, what the fuck is your problem?
Ohh lord! Fake Bonanza!

Gladiator, circus world
Glamour, pussy, pimp, whole good and service world
Paranoid, itchy-trigger-nigga nervous world
Shaytanic natural order in reversal world
The ipod, no God, zero circle world
The blow-a turtle world, smoke from the purple world
The killer murder world, hamburger murder world
Open twenty-four hours, all about them dollars
Pretty poison in pork sausage
Cold coffee and more coffins
Fake bonanza, fake bonanza
Huh? What? I don't understand ya!
What they talking bout save they soul, ohh lord, save they soul!
Help them reach the goal, peace!
You know, peace (boogieman!)
Don't be scared

Woke up this morning in my, my state, I'm dreaming
Ain't nothing even

Verse 1:
Well go 'head and leave
The call heard 'round the world from the wives of MC's
These cats is playin all that half a pound
A garment bag we snatch it down
Ain't got the state but we could prob'ly run a blacker town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC I ain't a blue collar worker
'Cuz this thing called rhymin' no different from coal minin'
We both on assignment to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin'
And then I start shinin'
You be strugglin' and strivin'
And they think you prime-timin'
Maintain and keep silence make note and observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
A concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
'Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preperation 'cuz this ain't no recreation
This is Pro Ball!
And we lettin you know y'all
At the show y'all
Doin' this for dough y'all

But inshallah I'm comin back to you
Baby boo

Verse 2:
But God willin' I'll be back home
To drop these heavy ass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalog of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin, been away for that long
But no you haven't well least that's how it seem to me
My home town is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the bar smokin greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it but its sweet scented
When you been down for a minute
Move around city damage
Break it down with the vintage
The innovative
Classical B-Boy image
Collect the winners
'Cuz thats the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cakalaks
Cali in the Caddilacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia State
DC make me say your name
Philly know we penatrate
Georgia make us generate
Like suns as they create the pace
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Minasan, like everybody out in Nippon
Say ichiban, may God have well where your getting from
Phenomenon, 'scuse me that's a phone call
Its the show y'all
Tryin' to get this dough y'all
'Bout to blow y'all
Been a pleasure to know y'all
And I'm lettin' you know that...

Gotta lotta things i got to do
But GOD willin I'm comin back to you
Back to you

An Open Letter From Mos Def,UnKnown,UnKnown,"An Open Letter From Mos Def
By Mos Def
February 1999
An Open letter From Mos Def...
Diallo was a West African immigrant with no prior criminal record who was shot and killed by police in the dark of night for simply being black. He was unarmed and shot at 41 times!
 
No unarmed man should be shot at even once!
 
One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago!
 
Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure!
 
I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.
Most of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists. 
They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth.
 They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!
The only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!... 
A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms',
 
the 'Brooklyns',
 the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.
We are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities.
 We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us. 
Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man...
 Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different! 
And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.
I hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.
Now I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.
Please stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.
I wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.
I want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.
Peace,
Mos Def",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-an-open-letter-from-mos-def-annotated
Crime & Medicine,True Magic,2006.0,"It was so beautiful. It was almost unfair
It's cold but it's true. It was so cold it got warm
Kids out in the schoolyard and playing
It was nice and calm. It was dangerous

When the MC's came, live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete Rocked it on
Now on to the mental plane, spark the brains with the building to be born
Crazy is on the track
Check em check chicka icka etta UHH

Strange Times
Everybody got their get high (Oh my)
Their get right, their get nice, they get by (Oh my)
They get open, get ready, get primed
The national pastime is victimless crime
You want your thrill and I want mine
As long we can get it we ain't got to say why
I don't mean to pry, you ain't got to lie
We ain't got to speak when it's written in the eyes
Whenever she was high off the sparkle in her palm
She had a young girl's smile and a hustler's charm
Dying from the city where the hustler's are born
Made, traced, murdered, replaced
Life-long residents barely feel safe
And the street's offer plenty taste and little faith (Break it down)
Little face, soft lips, little waist (Break it more)
Tiny hands (Oh god) fat ass (Oh more)
Big eyes like birthday surprise
Super dupa fly, born in 85
Repeat it to yourself: This is a victimless crime
Psyche your mind there's a victim every time
Your tasty little pill, your freaky little thrill
Pray won't leave you still, you wonder how it feel
It's real, pussy like some money that you steal
Eww

Dead wrong and live in America
Off the block and right in your area

I twist the hard caps back to blue bonnets
I repeat -- WHO WANT IT?

Ignition, propulsion,
 
put MC's on expulsion

Murder of a Teenage Life,True Magic,2006.0,"Man, what was the young blood name? Funk Crush
Young blood just hungry
It's no glamour, it's no glory
It's no joke no game
It's murder everyday, murder (Boogeyman)
(They shot the boy!)
The murder of a teenage life
Fire from the cold steel, the heat from the brights
The temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath
The murder of a teenage threat
The aroma of sinsemilia dollar superstar
Scum of vicodin cocaine tobacco leaf
Ecstatic tap-less fire water and freaky-deeky-e
The murder of a teenage chief
My easy speaking is easy as it seem to be
Hungry belly drama busts off easily
Balloon bang, pop, hot as a bang spot in Bangkok
Colder than a pimp Glock, aim shot the frame drops
Pressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop
Take not life in vain, now how the preacher was saying
Remember anyway 
they laid him in the straight box
Dark suit and gray socks
 
the neighborhood is all distraught
Candle lights upon the news report the families and students saw
Confused in awe, they weep into each others' arms
It's murder
New absence from a mother's arm
Even the warmth from the mother's arms
Could not keep her son from harm
From standing where the gun was drawn
Over come done and done he gone, murder
Shell like a bell that rung
The blood burst body temperature fell and plunged
And then the time it took the medics to come
The breath eased out of his lungs
And his soul eased out of the slums
And the voice eased out of the drums
The sireens they gleam they swung, murder
Telephone wire sneakers hung, murder
For the black and young, murder, and the Ave they from
I am from the block the president did not campaign on
Where the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on
Where hustlers stretch the yay long
Hustle hard for an outpost to trade on
Flip it over and make more
Where the blocks are yellow taped off
Young bloods is trained off for obese to gray zone
Where the pressure just stay on
But the lights and the heat don't
The place where you witness the true power of street folk
And that's where I'm coming from people
High post low key eighth oz and kilo
Law man dope man adversary amigo
Preacher man pimp hand both folding their C-notes
A black fist clutching deliverance for the people
Young hand reach out, strong hand reach in
Chop the devil's hand to make the fucker stop reaching
Ghetto people know when the voice of true speaking
M-Def, and foreal hold still nigga seein'
I ain't got to say please, just believe it
The unerasable the black ink fact
Y'all fuckers know exactly how to act get back
Forever black (forever black) never wack (never that)
From the K (Killa K) that's that (that's that)

Loaded up slide it back, ghetto black rock

Cuz my first thought covered it all: YOU WHACK!!!
And I don't care what you sound since not mumblin y'all
Cause you can't do me nothing at all
Which means, you can't shine my shoes, wash my drawers
Clean my car, walk my dog, mow my lawn
In other words duke, I don't need SHIT from them
All I got is hard rhymes and hot spit for them
And yeah, I got the country mule (raaatttttt) for them
See how dark it can get for them? Tell they mommas that's it for them
Get the flower vase sent for them
A sad story how it went for them
That's what you get for not listenin' FIRE!!
And a long verse of kumbayah, You stand strong you can't move higher
You move in ""how we all can move higher?""
Ready to roll like new tire
Well I can show you who the true lion

They be young and they pretty with them candy tops
They be young and they pretty and they can't be stopped
Shit I'm young and I'm pretty baby - can we rock?
Of course, you make me go hard, you're so soft
Your Louis clutch
 and your lip gloss
Your shoes and top are so boss
You're so floss
So of course, I know you wanna rock with me

To get close, ma know me better
I like how it feel when our hips roll together
They just go together, it's just so together
When the beat go off, you can go wherever
But the plan now
Do the dance now
Push your hands out
Poke your back out
Yeah, yeah, mama, that's how
Sing it back now


Listen
Don't say I never did nothing for ya
Don't say that Mos never put something on ya
Ah fuck it, say what you want, niggas
Like it or love it, hate if you want, niggas
Sun or moon, that's how it's going on, niggas
June to June, I get it 'til it's gone, niggas
From project bricks to porch and front lawn, niggas
To monster dares to every one of y'all niggas
Minnesota be straight jumping off
And your DJ gotta play that song - put it on, would ya?
New York City, I know it's been a long winter
This is the moment you've been waiting for all winter -
- and all spring, not a summer come
Ghetto  that cash glass bubbled up
Ghetto mass in a dance, and they huddled up
Young'uns in the mix, lights down, doubled up
It's so beautiful it's troublesome
And when it's gone you can't wait for another one the same
You remember (Exclusive)
And then it come back like


Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you wanna move your dancing feet
To the rescue

War,The New Danger,2004.0,"War is a global economic phenomenon
Ain't a batch of guns on where, hellfire
Spittin', run up everything they hittin'
Some do they job to dodge the barrage
As sleek projectiles never stay bound
Fire bite invades the night with light
Loud, fighter planes shout shell rain
When they shot to kill cops on the terrain
And leave any brain that may remain stained
You god damn right this war goin' too far
Socialists think they converse with the stars
Wars found, my find the beauty in the stars
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death even beneath radar
I level with death and she got pretty eyes
Nobody told me death was so damn fine
I go to sleep with that girl on my mind
Wake up in a sea, I wanna fire in line
Grab my heat, then it's get down time
One day I'mma make that girl all mine
But for now I'm a soldier abidin' my time
Writin' my rhyme behind enemy lines
Palestine, Kosovo, Cashmere
No different than the avenues right here
An increase in the murder rate each year
Paramilitary unit keep the streets clear
Curtains up on the theatre of warfare
Dramatic politics nightly preformed here
Worldwide from Colombia to Columbine
Don holders keep ya dollar signs on the line
""I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if possible
Jew, gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another
Human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness
Not by each other's misery
In this world, there's room for everyone
And the good earth is rich
And can provide for everyone a way of life""
Fuck that
You know the drill
Fix ya face
I'mma hustle off the hill
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
See every hunter need to kill
Go get my money man
I'm old school from off the hill
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
I give a fuck what I do
Go get my money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man
Go get my money man
Go get that money man
Gimme my money man

For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
 - speaking over sung vocals
Man.. for real
I was in love with this girl, y'know
I was.. to' up dog! I'm tellin you man
She was wild man.. f'real
It's just too.. let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn!
What your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Rebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like 'yo, I'm leaving now'
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sippin Crys straight up, shaking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwin the jam
For Reed is on the stand big things is in the plan
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around
Say, you is the same pretty girl that I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb (yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played it low and pretended I never met her
'How you feelin', 'oh I'm fine', 'my name is Mos', 'I'm Sharice'
I heard so much good about you its nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm lookin at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is *fucking* on me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet yo
I'm about to merc, I say peace to the family
She hop up like 'how you gonna leave before you dance with me?'

(sung)
I know I can't afford this life
For a moment
That its too soon
To forget
X2
(spoken by Mos Def)
She blew my whole habit, that girl
I was like 'what'
I played it low though, I was like 'yeah, aiight, c'mon then, let's go'
Its mad, it was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazin, she was just
Yo, she was like J. Kennedy
Word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like
Some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you
Beside, 'can I have a dance?' ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing lovers' rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer song
Finished then she whisper 'honey, let's exchange numbers'
Scene three: weeks of datin late night conversation
In the crib heart racin, tryin to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin singing Gregory Issac
Like 'if I don't, if I don't, if I don't'
Showin me that tan line and that tatoo
Playin Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Burnin candles, all my other plans got canceled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call my at my J.O., 'come now', I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin the p-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call 'I feel I'm runnin a fever'
Six months, I'm tellin her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really tryin to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn is over, let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She tellin me commitment is somethin she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ahh damnit! My shit is all Harrison Ford frantic
My 911 wasn't answered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, who hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kiddie club
With some banging ass Asian playin lay it down and lick me up

Yo, check it one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth comin live, future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
With the probable tenth, the universe expands length
The body of my text posess extra strength
Power-liftin powerless up, out of this, towerin inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop past all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects, prison-industry complex
Broken glass wall better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
But you chain cats get they CHA-POW, who dead now
Killin fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess, Michael Jackson was right, ""You Are Not Alone""
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients

You best believe you gotta find a new grind to get cream
The white unemployment rate, is nearly more than triple for black
So frontliners got they gun in your back
Bubblin crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin
Join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code, to S-S-I digits
The system break man child and women into figures
Two columns for who is, and who ain't niggas

Let’s Go,OMFGOD,2013.0,"It's been a long time coming but I know a change gone come....

? the path, the path chose me
This Allah's plan, divine degree
Natural high, window sheet
Up parallel view let the ghetto see
BK home to, no LA
All about that G-O-D, Amazing Grace
Hater whispers, blah blah blah
You too serious for nothing, hardy har
But it's no joke, with a winning smile
And one voice, with many styles
Been fresh, get fresh, see who fresher now
Strong bow, ox flow, watch it pull a plow
I'm goin in, they out of luck
Na sucker is there another, hit one o one
Cause of it,  the December slim
Block going first, I am him
This rap authentic, it's not a gimmick
Who went dumb and stay dumb, lord forgive him
I don't mind the cynics, I mind my business
Stay way above the game, that ass clever

Let's go, let's go, let's get it
Let's go, let it go
Let it go, let's get it
Get it, get it, got em, got em
Let's go, let's go, let's get it
Let's go, let it go
Let it go, let's get it

Super mathematics
Now that probably known for that O block
So sign a waiver to that old rock
Super smart, hand crafted art, decided on they know lot
Flow tougher than tough town, blacker than the ground they jump round
Overdose I'm over woke, be awake from crunch time
Be everywhere like sunshine
Leap right across, punchline
I beat the track, I eat the track, but I don't pay for breakfast
Lunch time
Dinner date, desert tray, Ramadan
Flow hungry, you see the sign between the line
That jeans only, no ?
I flow lovely, they go lovely
They catch feelings, these hoes touch me
I tell that ho like don't bunch me
Home awakening, like home study
But you so perdy, best of show
Tryin find the best way to touch it, let's go

Jam On It,Underground Airplay Version 1.0,UnKnown,"To all my people in the back jam on it {Right}
To all my people in the front jam on it {ha ha, ha ha}
To all my people on the side jam on it {he he, he he, right}
So jam on it, say what

The sweet old beats my speech radiates
I grab the mic my voice resulates and penetrates
I make the ""B-Boy"" emulate
A buck-fifty still swinging like a heavyweight
Me and the lounge about to levitate
You don't believe let me demonstrate
The way we make cats disintegrate

Well hold up you got to stop the tape
You got to prove you can rock the breaks
Me and my man going to investigate
The whole way that you operate, cooperate
And what's your name? {Mos Def}
And where you from? {Brooklyn}
And how you living {Very well, very well}
Damn you had to say it twice? {That's right}
So you nice? {Damn right}

I rock the party all night all night
{All right, all right}
So why you over here ripping with me?
Trying to prove you position to me?
{Some cats ain't equiped to MC}
But you can see I'm different ""G""
The universal magnificently
I rock the party eficiently
From the Brooklyn Vicinit-y
And I do it so lyrically
That you got to give it to me
Like Rick James, I kick game and spit flame
Burning rappers all up out their frame
We get into this vein
From Brownsville all the way down to Brisbane
{Damn this brother's flow is insane}
That's what I've been trying to explain
Got no time to play games
Keep it coming like the next train
Make the party people exclaim
Whenever they hear my name
They go ""Mos Def""
Oh yes my style is so fresh
Guranteed to win any MC contest
Old school like the eighty-four fresh dress
You spend you assets to get my cassette
Now that's fresh, the red hook address
Make a cop jealous swell like abscess
I'm shoutin' big love to Medina and the rest
Bout' to drop it on your block when I'm hot on the press

I said people in the front jam on it {Say what, say what}
To all my people in the back jam on it {Say what, say what}
To all my people on the side jam on it {Ha ha, ha ha}
Jam on it, Ha ha, ha ha
To all my people in the front jam on it
To all my people in the back jam on it
To all my people on the side jam on it
So jam on it, ha ha, ha ha

You see my name is Mos Def and my style will never pest
Brown skinned body-rocking MC
I got the black zodiac and you know it's never whack
Sagitarius definatley
You see it's me and lyricist and we're getting serious about to make another hit
I tell your homeboy chill cuz' his style ain't ill but it's straight up counterfeit
You see I'm faster than a speeding bullet and when I'm on the set
All the hip-hop fans just raise they hands because the one and only mighty Mos Def
You see I come into the party in a ""B-Boy"" stance I rock the mic so viciously
So all the real ""B-boys"" and real ""B-Girls"" never know others better than me

I said hey Mos Def you can't steal the show
You ain't the only MC out here with flow
I'm the Pro-Castro and I'm letting you know
That I get on the mic and go toe to toe

Well cool young brother and just slow you role
Cuz' your arm's to shook to have mic control
See I get on the mic and jump off your case
You best get out my face and stay in a child's place

See I get on the mic because I know I can
And I'm fresher than you because I know I am
So when I jump on the stage you better step back
Because your name is Mos Def but your really Mos Whack

Uh listen up little brother you ain't grown
The sun is going down you need to take you butt home
And come outside with your whack freestylin'
You should have kept it in the house like Debbie Galler
When I grab the microphone people scream my name
The ain't no sesame street this is a grown-man's lane
See you best heed my words and listen up
Or I'm a tell your momma to whip your butt

Well you ain't my daddy and I'm letting you know
That you can't tell me when it's time to go
See I get on the mic and show you what it's about
Cuz' even my momma said knock you out

Well if you didn't know baby boy I'm a tell ya'
You need to learn to respect your elders
But since you here and you think you got skill
Then get on the mic and show your real

Well I'm the devastatin' never fakin'
Always keep your body shakin'
Steady rockin' never stoppin'
Keep your body always jockin'
Rock the beat, shock the beat
Till' it's time to stop the beat
Steady moving show improvement
Keep the party keep on groovin'

Well hey young blood that was fresh
You just got one hundred on your MC test
You got a soul-shocking body-rocking set you see
You need to pack up your bags and get down with me

So jam on it, so jam on it
I said jam j-jam j-jam on it
I said were rocking to the bright early morning
I said jam j-jam j-jam on it
This is the one to keep inside the jam
And make you get up and just do that dance
This is the one to keep inside the jam
And make you get up and just clap your hands
New York you got to jam on it
And Atlanta got to jam on it
And BK you got to jam on it
Got to jam on it, you got to jam on it
And Miami you got to jam on it
And California you got to jam on it
(?) got to jam on it
Got to jam on it, got to jam on it
Chicago got to jam on it
And Detroit cuz' they got to jam on it
And St. Louis got to jam on it
Got to jam on it, got to jam on it
The whole world you got to jam on it
And Brooklyn yes we got to jam on it
The ""Lyricist"" just to make you jam on it
Make you jam on it, make you jam on it

Even though man made transmit my transcripts
And they can't be tamped with
Allah protect this
I make jams for crime clans and working class fams
And all y'all mans who eat aci with chams
And heads in the flats who dispatch the dollar vans
Young kids in badlands with great escape plans
Who eat most of they meals outta boxes and cans
Casualties and cutbacks of social programs
Dedicated
To all those who rode slave ships
Who screamed and cried but survived the ride
I know that my life is better cause you weathered the tide
Harder work on this side making truth magnify
Devils can't stop me, but they damn sure try
Shine the light on the Earth that receive and radiate
Ain't no surface I've seen that's too dense to penetrate
There are plans by many hands to make us deviate
So I speak on plates so that all good life regenerate
Baby ain't no time to deliberate
He put the wonder in the world let's activate
Let's activate, let's activate, let's activate
Cause


You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God made the world get up and move
You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world get up it's true
You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God made the world get up and move
You know I ain't gotta lie to you
God Allah made the world get up it's true
Yes you know I ain't gotta lie to you

The way I feel sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin' smoke
Smile on my face but it's really no joke
You feel it in the streets, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down, they focus
The focus gettin' clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes ya don't hear me
I push it past the bass, no nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And it's volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere, penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life holla black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Shoulders the lions raw voice is the siren
I swing round, ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked, a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suttins tryna hide like the struggle won't find 'em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere, penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, talk'll lead you on a shell

Sit and come, relax, riddle off the mac, it's the patch
I'ma soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well, say about noonish commin' out the whip
And lookin' at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carrying laundry, what's wrong G, hungry?
No, gimme oil or get fuck out my country
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff
Till his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, bitter like I's pissed off on moon
I'm like ""Shorty, hope that we can fix our differences soon! Bye!""
Buying apples, I'm breaking 'em
Brooklyn take everything, why not just take the damn food Black bastard
I don't understand it, on another planet?
15 months of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasing the sentiment, gentlemen
Getting down on their Middle-Eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crap
Walk over, kicked one of my fabulous raps (La-dee Da-dee)
Arab jaws dropped, they well wished, they glad wrapped
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad

Analyze my data, not a fader on the face of the earth
Can blend rhythms like my will, surreal spinnin
Ever-movin like evolution it's retribution
For sellin roots, lessen futures, I'm steppin to fuchsia
Sun rises, my subconsciousness culminates constant
Live to see various i-de-ologies, angles like isosceles
Read my auto-b-i-ography
So many sides of me that vibrantly shine
Velocity's properly thick like mahogany dimes
We findin beauty in this urban-gritty usually overlooked by many
Movin through the densely populated city
Assuming eventually 'we gotta get ova'
I document culture closer to the edge
Bolder than the print, open to interpretation, gazin deep into the glitz?
To my people, raise you fists
I know it stays intent, whatever pays your rent, but saves your soul
You know the drill, it go:

Hotter than most dudes
From left to right, on top and below you
Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do
-I'm Diverse- these other cats is just hopefuls
When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

Who the poisoned pen?
Mos got the inkwell full of serum
Prescribed for any emcee claimin they ill
A small dose'll change the way that they feel
Milligrams of the raw, snow-cut, check how I label a pill
It's MD, the spit-doctor, chant like a witch-doctor
Recite me, and ya whole ailment get proper

Mixin the potion with diversify and seven, my man

It's the B-R-O double up K-L-(w)Y-liN out
The cowboys who don't fret to pull they Llamas? out
Iron horse style cab?, Coup de Ville ridin out
No lights, no cam, action - drama'd out
?? out, absorb the shit that I'm about
Inner-city Bruno, ghetto folks, holla out
I'm good money, tell the doubters get they wallets out
Hot when the dice is out, they go broke findin out
Smack ya mojo, caught a half of 'oh no'
Magical vocals, get it there like postal
Underground nigga that spoke truth and broke through
Shine bright when I'm far from my close-to
I told you, you know how Mos do
Hotter than most dudes
From left to right, on top and below you
Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do
-I'm Mos Def- them other cats is just hopefuls
When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin that you need to know, dude
This is how we go through

Exposed to a higher set of variables, as fly as aerial
Definin stereo components, moments with my master
Remasterin techniques, havin some fresh sheets
Damagin margins with a broader outlook - 'we lookin out, y'all'
Me and Mr. Mighty Mos, we outlaws
Blazin in the saddle, raisin like the mornin star, formin majestic
Candescent like the street lamps, I-be-amped to inn-o-vate
Reminiscent of technology, probably just my will to build
To real notions of emotions similar to the seven seas
Steadily sparkin cables, tables turnin like the high tide
I'm captive to this music, vastness, into it I skydive
Tumblin like buildings crumblin on inner-cities cumbersome
They comin in to run us out, my niggas shout for justice
You wanna link with me, then let me know
This music is like my vessel so we seem to be inseparable
From C-town, headed eastbound
You know the rest, it go:
Hotter than most dudes
From left to right, on top and below you
Flow like the coastals, move like smoke do

When they ask who put it down, baby, you know who
Tell your whole crew, it's somethin that you need to know, dude

You are now rocking with the best
Brooklyn's own, Brooklyn's only

Big shout out to Cash Money, Shy and Medina Green
Listen...

Three words for the con, no you aren't
Smoke smoke but you're no cigar-a
Soon as Mos hit the open market
The ghetto know to cop it
Get on my back like a open warrant
Brook-lyn sick so retarded
Hop on your phone and told your partna
Hop offa him, and told your mama
Got no type of focus problems
Y'all better focus harder
Get out your rhyme book and smoke some scama
Ever far you go, I'm going harder
Understand I, rock today like it's no tomorrow
Last year, my catalog was so impressive
That this year my rookie card's a great investment
Am I hot? Nigga change the question
Are you hotter than me?
Shit we can take out the product and see
Y'all don't want no drama with me
Without a part in a film
A director and a call from the guild
Y'all don't want no problems for real
So why you speaking of beef?
Y'all youngins don't y'all need to be sleep?
Cause secretly I'm the nigga that you dreaming to be
It ain't as easy as that
It's only one Mos, leave it at that
Whatever shine you had I'm leaving with that
I give a fat baby's ass where your peoples is at
And where your heaters is at
You fuck around and catch a leak in your back
Get a hug dogg you need to relax
Don't get beaten up cause of rap
And don't get mad at me cause you're whack
Shit genetics is the reason for that
You ain't seeing me I'm seeing to that
I'm from the brightest hardest star to ever be on the map
And that's the B-R-O-double y'all don't want no trouble rest

You ever felt like the realest nigga alive?
Felt too pretty or powerful to die?

Have you ever begged for mercy?
Have you ever wished you died?

Have you ever taken pride in the crime?
Been too hungry to back down or hide?
Felt low down dirty? Or super duper high?
Or contemplated murder, robbery, or suicide?
Tell the truth...
Taken medicine for trouble in your mind?
Or taken down a number? For taking up a scheme?
I made her wild, beautiful take her 'til she skeet?
Take her to the penthouse or take her to the skreet?

And every buggy on the block got the tune on blast

So shiny, so gutter, mean moody and cool

They might be doing things that you wanna' do
You fantasize as they be living it through
The big home with the beautiful view
You have a swim in the pool, and get fresh
And take a spin in the coupe
Tell the truth...
You probably want to feel the world in your palm
While hold a gun in your hand
And make 'em know you a star
Tell the truth...
And there's those who probably already are
They well known in they zone
Or they town or they block
Tell the truth...
Then there's the rest who are usually not
And the heavy dose of thug feel like all that they got
So they ready to rock...R-r-rock...

Acting like a man but a chick frontin in disguise
Open on some thicker thighs, smokin on a blunt of lies
Tradin in a badge for a sash sayin sucker hi
Lookin at her son now, probably make a mother cry
Should of listened to that song tellin' you to ""Walk on by""
But you didn't now your washed up like a cup of tide
Let me know I got the heat when you think it's time to dry

What you think you talkin 'bout mistake me for some other guy
Need to buy a watch cause ain't no shorty gonna give the time
Day or night birthdays, Kwanzas or Valentines
Big talk, really small but you ain't a friend of mine
You ain't even genuwine sweeter than a Cinnabon

But wit five fingers and a fist I'm deadly as the Pentagon
You don't want beef with MILLER cuz I'm ILLER

Or because you bout as criminal as killers

Whoa how, I see you slick with the words now
Gassed cause you got a chick with some curves now
Calm your nerves down you was locked Carmen Brown
Draws had hers down scored on the first down
Yeah, so get the keys out your purse now
Run to your car fore' you're laying in a hearse clown

How you sound yo you dirtier than Jers now
Extortin all that money thought you'd have a couple furs now

Ha, watch ya speed I don't wanna play around

* Chorus One seperate then Chorus Two overlaps One *
I came all the way from Brooklyn to present my rep
Lyrically deep like sleep; I rock hard like Led Zepp
I take steps and leave impressions on planets
More complicated than life so rappers can not understand it
Talking that hardcore shit; but I don't buy it
Sit down eat your slice of pizza and be quiet!
Cause all that noise you talk is not needed
I cut headz off at the knees and leave em all defeated
So stay seated, or get deleted from the program
Let it be known I don't follow cause I'm my own man
With my own plan, cause the mind is infinite
We got four minutes, so everybody get widdit!

Cause all my people out in Brooklyn get LOVE
Cause all my people out in Queens get LOVE
Uptown and Boogie Down you get LOVE

Waves
My style's the newest rhyme craze
Blow up, like grenades, hit words, without shades
Hold ya lighter, the Flatbush dolla camp writer
Roll with more Dangerous Minds than Michelle Pfeiffer
Pay the piper, I lay the pipe just like a plumber
Went without a ride for one too many summers, NOW
I'm out to get the cream like Carnation
Send headz home like George Bush did to Haitians
No patience, I got ta have it, the fine fabric
I learned The Facts of Life from Mrs. Garrett
But now I'ma do it my Way like Carlito

We come to tell the people dem, we're talkin one love

What it is y'all, bust it yap

As is requested on the record my speech is live, devised or nothin'
Fortified the weapon, the best was selected
You ain't the mos def you the mos defective
Bounce and keep steppin'
My inkwell is a riverbed that resurrect the living dead
I manifest what's considered but what isn't said
Stay on the dot like a infrared
Sew up the block with whole different thread
The durable, flame-resistant, breathable, fantastic fabric
You all get into your formal wear, weave classics
My speech fits so seamless ya need glasses
To recognize the stitch on your nerve fiber
The Black Star gon' make the whole world turn brighter
You shine bright but my constellation burn brighter
They ain't invited to the table, make it turn cipher
They chattin' big words but backs is yellow like Big Bird
When I flow you ain't seein' no dough like interns
I'm professor, you a freshman just scared of your midterms

""And I'm Crooklyn's finest, Crooklyn's finest"" -] Notorious B.I.G

Believe that
Brooklyn my habitat
The place where it happen at
Lives sway in the sharp balance of the battle-ax
Irons is brandished at
Thugs draw their hammer back
It's where you find the News 2 crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, the Summertime Jam is at
They play B.I.G. and get you open like a sandleback
Hotter than candle wax
Hustle and you can't relax
The crack babies tryin' to find where their mammas at
It's off the handle, black
Where big police scandals at
Turned in to action screenplay sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot low gear is at
The stompin' grounds is where you find the pound smokers that
Be blazin' tron that have your wave cap floatin' back
The doorstep where the ""Dispossessed"" posted at
Dope fiends out on Franklin Ave. sellin' Zorarax
You big ballin' better keep your money folded back
Cuz once the young guns notice that, it's over black
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MCs was a local cat

Uh huh yeah

Classic like Adidas Top 10s
I'm free from all fillers and toxins
Mysterious like chessboxin'

From mixin' up their wicked concoctions
Kweli, that's my (???) and thought is our department
If you can't clean up, don't start then
My print on the parchment translate finer and larger
To leave the competition disheartened
The stars shine black like carbon
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all my words pass the margin
To hold a mic I'm throbbin'
I carry off the page
Go on and on for days
So my phrase autographed on the breeze you breathe
Inhale the crisp air of the brand new seas
Where we run things but things don't run we
What you hear from me constructed carefully
Walk until my brothers on the run so fearfully
Passionate to the point of tearful
They be like ""Mos I FEEL YOU""
Holdin' it down and still DO
FO' REAL DUDE, I'm real true
Radiate whatever I'm far from or near to
Stay electric like eels who preside in the ocean tide
Better tell the clothesline time to open wide, and RECIEVE this
No trick, son we sleeveless
So nice you can either recite or read this
My semantic's deep like Atlantis secrets
Who you got beef with? Then STATE your grievance
MAKE IT KNOWN before my defense make a zone
Make peace 'fore you find it too hard to make it home
Vocal cords so powerful they might break a bone
We rollin' with the natives, regulate the Terrordome
Bout to enter to the ages where my crew take the throne
My DNA is out of print, you can't make a clone
So rockin' it, keep rockin' it

Soldier’s Dream,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I’m not gon sing a song or nothing
Um, what is that term, they call it... post-traumatic stress syndrome?
That thing that uh, soldiers will get. I think a lot of people get that
It’s like when you experience something and uh, it affects you for a long time afterwards
I guess everything works that way. Certain things have more impact than others
Sometimes it visits you in your dreams or when you’re quiet or just at peace or trying to be at peace
A lot of soldiers get it. A lot of common people get it
Most of the time common people are soldiers, that’s just the way it works out
This is a soldier’s dream

The other night
I was tumbling towards an uneasy sleep
Where I had discovered myself
Atop the sweet sticky firmament of my dreams
Daybreak came and discovered me
With my fantasies pasted to my face
I can't look at you right now
""Show me your eyes,"" she says
""Later,"" he says
""Now, now.""
""NO!""
Shame is a prison you know
Yeah, well discretion is a fortress
You’re staring and looking too closely
There’s so much about me that I hide
That careful eyes will recognize
If you look closely you’ll notice
That the pattern on this soft broadcloth shirt
Is made of
Working man's blood
And praying folk’s tears
If you look closer, you’ll notice that
This pattern resembles
Tenement row houses, project highrises
Cell block tiers
Discontinued stretches of elevated train tracks
Slave ship gullies, acres of tombstones
If you look closer, you’ll notice
That this fabric has been carefully blended
With an advanced new age polymer (oh man, that’s nice)
To make the fabric lightweight
Weatherproof, and durable
All this
To give some sort of posture and dignity
To a broken body that is a host for scars
I am the new landmark
I am the museum of injury
Soldiers visit me and admire me quietly
Whispering among themselves
You’re no soldier
Your soft bright eyes never have to
Survey the battlefield
Much less its collected relics of which, I am one
So, my flesh bullet-ridden remains hidden
Underneath these soft fabrics
Which I carefully select
That stand in for how I used to feel
For how I remember feeling
For how I dream about feeling
For how I feel about you
And now your curious fingers want to search
Beyond this tender armor
I can't look at you right now
This is my rifle
There are many like it
But this one is mine
2x

Your eyes are too careful
Collecting it all arranging it all;
Surgically, robotically, exactly
I can’t look at you right now
But that doesn’t matter because
You can look at me and the longer that
I don’t return your gaze
The harder that your gaze
Starts to run across my back
Like a nervous policeman’s hands:
Brisk, intent, anxious for discovery
If discretion is a fortress
Then you’re threatening to destroy it
By simply
Standing at the gates
And refusing to leave
I can’t look at you right now
But you can look at me
Do you see me?",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-soldiers-dream-lyrics

Very Well,DJ Soul: Competition is None,UnKnown,"So what you doing
I'm feeling very well
Rocking this from Brooklyn, this is my vibration
Make you have sensation, when you hear the jam
All you want to say is happiness yo
Sometimes I get a feeling inside it's like (what)
It's something type of hard to explain it's like (what)
I got a good vocab and such but Ock
Somethings still remain out of touch- it's like
Your very first kiss or- it's like
Like a new pair of kicks or
You know what I'm saying Ock
It's just the vibe
I can't articulate it
It's better demonstrated
And when it's integrated
Then things get rennovated
It's deeply contemplated
Before I operated
My steady advance will keep the jams populated
Okay okay I'm ready, (alright) I'm feeling good
Beats by 88 Key, Mos Def the emcee
The HOTtest entry, inside your benzy
Yo they got digitals now, true
That's old school
Don't run no new game, I like the old rules- like
Early to sleep and early to wake
You keep your long on money and short on mistakes
I speak on beat breaks, my jams is keep sakes
So recite that (cite that)
I said recite that (CITE that)
Cause when I'm laying down here baby it's tight phat
When I react that ain't no army that can strike back
And if they do they catching more than the eye jab (poof)
A lot of cats like to bite, I copyright that
So when you hear it on your box you say ""I like that""
Send salaams to Abstract, is this the right track?
We staying, underground like the NTA
Be controller of the rock like the NBA
I remember days when supper was the empty tray
But I still held it down for mines an-y-way
See I still held it down for mines an-y-way
See I still held it down for mines an-y-way
It's how we do say
Hey man what you doing
Feeling very well
Rocking this from Brooklyn
This is my vibration
To make you have sensation
Family situation
When you hear the jam
All you want to say, is Happiness- yo
The era we entering is mad exciting
Sometimes I got more rhymes than I remember writing
I stand like a titan above the mental midget
My safe originate from seven-eighteen digits
Thats BROOKLYN- for area code impaired
Medina of the planet for cats from out there
Mos Def official native of the Bed-Stuy section
I'm standing 5'10"" with the chocolate complextion
I keep the function moving in the right direction
I'm coming with the new to keep the next crew guessing
Who you stressing! Pump your brakes and slow down
I hold court, you get cut short like pronoun
I throw down just like Ali in Zaire
I'm fresh from my feet to the roots in my hair
Kangol and Wallabees is some gear that I wear
Skid out to Chamber Street and I copped the fly pair
And I DARE- anyone of these new chaps
To step in the arena without they crew's back
Approahing the recital with titles you lose that
Send home a telegram to relay the news that the
M- for magnificant
O- praise omnipotent
S- for significant
D- for type different
E- for effic-ient
F- the fly fisherman
Netting everything from here to Lake Michigan
So all my people if you're out there listening
Give me a shout and let me know what you getting in
Some emcees ain't even worth mentioning
Let's congregate and compilate these Benjamins
We take the crown and break them down like divis-ion
To realize what my eyes is envisioning
Dollars correct and I'm the man on deck
But otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect
Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect
Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect
Otherwise I gotta jet, it's no disrespect

The Tournament,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Power influence prestige control
Guess right now we'll start the show
(all right)

They making they plans, dusting they guns off
And wondering, what I need to do to be boss?
Or who I need to fight?
Or who I need to kill?
Or push back on the climb to the top of the thrill?
Its a tournament with so many players
A system with too many layers
A pyramid with a few at the top
Plenty at the base here to nature the race
The closer that you get to the top, its small space
But the further you move in the heights, its less safe
But the views are amazing
And when you moving on up, its pure praises
And if you fall off, bloody spectacle
Coliseum sound wave, the roar is incredible
And the risk is immeasurable
But for top shot the danger's acceptable
You too could be the Don
Bright gems on your limb pretty hens on your arm
Respect at any threshold that you step across
The life of the charm
The hammer and the gods
Never-mind the house, run your own odds
Jump in to swim never mind the sharks
They on the payroll
They teeth don't show unless you say so
Here's to the fruits of your labor
So ripe and full with flavor
Here's to the dream fulfilled
To the fantastic being real
To the stars in the hills
To the power of the will
Everyday is like your birthday
Everyday is like your birthday
Every time is like the first time
Every walk is a parade
Total control

Everyday is like your birthday

Hear he really promising the platinum, get down
You'll be backin it out, straight backin 'em down
With your hand on your mouth
And damn baby girl, what's that all about?
You know the ave puttin curves in the brow
On your job, all workin it out
I like how you coordinate: purse, skirt, and the blouse
Around the way, comin straight out the house
You just laid on the couch
Make a cat just pause and be ""Wow""

Sweet like my first kiss in the back of the flick
I have to insist, miss, that we chat for a bit
But your ass wanna diss

You just assume that I be on that supermasculine *shit*
Crackin the whip just to shut you you and fasten your lip

A Ha,True Magic,2006.0,"Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cuz it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminesce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thuggin
How me and Charlie Chims (aiyyo what?) I'm only buggin
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sittin roadside, that ain't harder to plan
I'm out here for my fam doin all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cuz we grown to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first artist, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the judge many years ago
Three billion strong and here we go
GOOD MORNINNNNNNNNNGG VIETNAM!!!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up) 
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbin it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
Shoutout ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representin it
Sittin on they front stoop sippin Guinesses
Usin native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenaments
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a prov, it's our style that's uncalm
From ?sun? to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
White ?coff guawinas? in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ?yarda trenny? Brown's Village
Parkside tennants caught, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starite City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Kanarcy, Farraget, Fullgreen, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playin loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown STRONGLY!
RAISE IT UP!
Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the news tool crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jame is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin you can't relax
The crack babies tryin to find where they mama's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stompin grounds, where you find a pound, smoke is that
Be blazin charm that have your wave cap floatin back
The doorstep where the disposessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin zovarax
You big ballin better keep your money folded back
Cuz once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on takin it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-a-ha-lyrics

Ms. Fat Booty (clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
 - speaking over sung vocals
Man.. for real
I was in love with this girl, y'know
I was.. to' up dog! I'm tellin you man
She was wild man.. f'real
It's just too.. let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn!
What your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Rebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like 'yo, I'm leaving now'
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sippin Crys straight up, shaking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwin the jam
For Reed is on the stand big things is in the plan
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around
Say, you is the same pretty girl that I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb (yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played it low and pretended I never met her
'How you feelin', 'oh I'm fine', 'my name is Mos', 'I'm Sharice'
I heard so much good about you its nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm lookin at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is *fucking* on me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet yo
I'm about to merc, I say peace to the family
She hop up like 'how you gonna leave before you dance with me?'

(sung)
I know I can't afford this life
For a moment
That its too soon
To forget
X2
(spoken by Mos Def)
She blew my whole habit, that girl
I was like 'what'
I played it low though, I was like 'yeah, aiight, c'mon then, let's go'
Its mad, it was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazin, she was just
Yo, she was like J. Kennedy
Word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like
Some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you
Beside, 'can I have a dance?' ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing lovers' rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer song
Finished then she whisper 'honey, let's exchange numbers'
Scene three: weeks of datin late night conversation
In the crib heart racin, tryin to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin singing Gregory Issac
Like 'if I don't, if I don't, if I don't'
Showin me that tan line and that tatoo
Playin Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Burnin candles, all my other plans got canceled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call my at my J.O., 'come now', I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin the p-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call 'I feel I'm runnin a fever'
Six months, I'm tellin her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really tryin to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn is over, let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She tellin me commitment is somethin she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ahh damnit! My shit is all Harrison Ford frantic
My 911 wasn't answered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, who hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kiddie club
With some banging ass Asian playin lay it down and lick me up

No Particular Place to Go,Cadillac Records: Music From the Motion Picture,2008.0,"Riding along
In my automobile
My baby
Beside me
At the wheel
I stole a kiss
At the turn
Of a mile
My curiosity
Running wild
Crusin' and playin'
The radio
With no particular
Place to go
Riding along
In my automobile
I's anxious
Tto tell her
The way I feel
So I told her
Softly and sincere
And she leaned
And whispered
In my ear
Cuddlin' more
And drivin' slow
With no particular
Place to go
No particular
Place to go
So we parked way
Out on ko-ko-mo
The night was young
And the moon
Was gold
So we both decided
To take a stroll
Can you image
The way I felt
I couldn't
Unfasten her
Safety belt
Riding along
In my calaboose
Still trying
To get her
Belt a-loose
All the way home
I held a grudge
For the safety belt
That wouldn't budge
Crusin' and playin'
The radio
With no particular

History w/ kweli,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Kweli say, ""Everybody act according to the season that they born in""
Some are the night, some are the morning, some at noon
Some in winter, some in June
It's our code, it's the natural
The science is a joke
For me and mines, yours and you
Let's move, tell you a little about mine, yo
I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad, feelings pass and change
But they never leave, they here to stay
Holiday, holiday, happy birthday
Teenage love, the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh, this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox, seven and three
M.D., the history (come on)
Every soul got wonder D (yes)
It's where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete, the start and the end
Then it just go round again... again

Again and again, brand new
Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

I was born in the decade of decadence where they worship what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the North Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like ""Bye"", we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where the hug you with the firearm try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with The Roots like the Given Tree
Powerful, bigotry I work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We ""Get it Poppin'"" like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

And don't call it come back in particular
We've been effort blending to affirmer or
Fade into peripheral, 
{?}
 of the minister's original
We're broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star so tight, burning soul temperatures and ministers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures

Intro: Mos Def + (Sample))
(Let the sun shine)
Yeah yeah its a brand new day y'all (Let the sunshine in)
Turn me up in the top a little bit dog
Little do you know, y'all gonna hear this one (The suns shinin')
Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen..
(Verse 1: Mos Def)
I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock, way above the game
To be point blank with you motherfuck the game
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dog, Not to def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not to dude
I'm grown man business, and I am not in school
Put your hand down youngin' this is not for you
On my +J.O.+ with beats by Kan-ye yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh, like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day yo
On more time than a Roley, or Seiko
Step on deck, your neck do what I say so
Get up or get out, get down or lay low
(Chorus 1: Mos Def + (Sample))
(Let the sun shine)
Standing in the shadow of a fabulous man
Brooklyn nigga I am, Black Dante (Let the sunshine in)
That nigga, that dude
Black People, Lets Move (The suns shinin')
Shout out to my man Talib Kweli, yes
We on top-a top-a, shout-a shout-a
Check it out..
(Verse 2: Mos Def + (Sample))
Slim nigga that casts a big shadow
Cherokee red to shoot the long arrow
Got more skill, more aim, and more ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, hail Mary, full of grace
Niggas come in and shoot up the place
And make you pull up your face
The deck, I'm a pull out the ace
From the jungles of the empire state
Where it ain't no escape, 247, 718
And thats like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the states, I'm collecting my pay
Blast off then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro ball not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
(Chorus 2: Mos Def + (Sample))
(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understanding me straight (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt, excellence
Its what it is, what it is
And thats what it is, you see? (The suns shinin')
Ha, Fire..
(Verse 3: Mos Def)
'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements I perform my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn it don't matter if you holler or whisper
Your coming through clan, 'cause I'm right here wit'cha
Ain't gotta edit the slang, I got it, I'll get ya
Yo, brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers
The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas the ghetto civilians
Y'all 'gon feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walk a thousand paces of light ahead of the game
By the time you get where I'm standing, I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move on
(Outro: Mos Def + (Sample))
(Let the sun shine)
I move in, and y'all must move on
'Cause I move to strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)
Made it go without a brand new car
Made it fresh without a brand new song
And give a fuck about what brand you are (The suns shining')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me y'all
Be good to your family y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody needs family y'all
Raise a hand, you understand me y'all
Everybody needs family y'all
Be good to your families dog
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody needs family dog
Raise a hand, you understand me pa
Thats what it is...thats my man
Family and my family Pencil Pete
My man too, all our loved ones behind the walls
All of those who still in the struggle

To all the real soldiers, black people (Let the sunshine in)

One Four Love Pt. 1,"We Are Hip Hop, Me, You, Everybody, Pt. 1",UnKnown,"Yo you sent out the signal right?
And this is what happened
The voice of Hip Hop got heard
Never comprimised this is how we put it down c'mon

Throughout my thuglife I've seen the ???
Like ??? fight over the role of dice
Flashing whole lights when killas on a hiest
So contight, get poltergiest over the bowl of Christ
Who pulled the slice from cats aiming gats who showed the hiest
Told you right she be the one that come and hold your mic
Then aim it at the whole vice squad just like ???
Rollin like every prototype was dolomight
One man recall his ice inside his gun hand he holds for life

This for the ones with holes in they graves
Waitin for they piece when the law misbehave
I say we off ??? watch 'em walk the beat
Like you can't cross streets make them all retreat
(now) Judges and the jury be a little to appointed
Making us defendants when we supossed to be the plantiffs
Laugh now cause soon the thrill stops
Heads get it on and start to kill cops

I'm sober but the pull me over
What i do yo? (what we do yo?)
Poe-poe go i'm drivin to slow (cool yo)
I torin' them explorin them (damn)
For them that's why i'm ignoring them (uh-oh)
Bring like king skip
Before they bring this to some Rodeny King shit
Forget them fools
Now make no sudden moves
They reachin for they tools (let's move)
You buggin dude
Kirk you ran the stop, word them pigs frontin
Yo tell like you tell 'em cousin we ain't did nothin
All they see is three blacks in a jeep with seats back
Lookin for ??? packs how the blood dog can eat that
They thirstin for a reason to blast you can't beat that
Gats and a badge to match you can beat that so bounce 'em

My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up and do it right
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up and do it right
Do it right ya'll, keep it tight ya'll, do it right ya'll, just do it

Blood on they hands, blood on my mans
Destroying the fam
More souljers die, another mother cries
Anthony Buyers, ??? ???, Diallo
Let it keep happenin and theirs more to follow
It's even deeper then that penal shot in the back
Forever we fight and cus but the world still adjust
So many bullets just to stop one man
Is that the plan
To leave us all dead in the street

I'm an opponent of violence
To many of my guys have to condome it in silence
Law takes lives and can only do violence
And with night sticks i write quick
Hopin that

I might hit somebody in the heart

Like an arrow with her eyes on a sparrow
Yo i feel my peoples pain all in my bone marrow

I'm tellin Pharoahe to let my folks go
Ma's been singin to law like they background vocals

Local, state, federal cops have been payed properly
To protect the property
How can i just stand by and watch a man die for nothin and not react
The way we spit on this track is how we bustin back

Yo i pimp slap 5-0
Get behind them and make the marks drive slow

Yo, you wanna know how to improve on the quality life?
Try respectin it step into my zone and maifest a check in it

Cops they transport me from Long island to Medina
With they fucked up demeanor
Dreamin of stickin it to me like Abner Louima
Pharoahe slash El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
With plans of retaliations of they coward ass
God please allow me to preach for 'em
A voiceless man through a spirit i speek for him
Step to city hall if a dove flew for Diallo
With a vision of cops inside the Public Enemy logo

All that scheming and plotting
The young absorb like cotton does
Ecspeacially in my city where the boys steady rockin in
You would thought 5-0 would cut it all short
But they play the biggest part in the art of living arms
In our land cops guns clap more then hands
As if we don't deserve what they hear to preserve
We just tryin to do it right in these worlds that we rappin in
While they trying to fill us all up with more lead then zepilin

My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what? love peace and understandin

Oh no, niggas ain't scared to hustle
It's been seven days, the same clothes

Mos Def, Nate Dogg, and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name, say my name
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently layed down and played my game
My own two raise my flame
'Cause dick ridin' ain't my thing
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now I'm gettin' it and their whole grill is cookin'
Mad, 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings
When y'all was askin' permission I just stepped up and took it
What? The kid's better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin', then get money now
'Cause in a minute there's gon' be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin', as usual, some cats won't heed it
The hard headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame that jealous gays is too short to see it

Through stages and wackness, foul rats is blazin'
And it amazes me how you claim thug
But go two ways without Skytell pagers

Than motorcade police parades through East L.A
More beef then deli's plus what I vent is just
What you must defend is evil aim, uh
Hallelujah, Pharoahe Monch'll tool ya
Maintain the same frame of mind, school ya
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, preacher with scriptures
I'ma quit the rip ya, reach ya
Pharoahe and Mos is verbalized, Mos is coast to coast
We boast to be the most explosive here
Ferocious, the lyrical prognosis
The dose is just leavin' you mentally unfocused here
Emcee's just come on 'round
You're the next contestants on, 'Catch a beat down'
Don't be hesitant, sound cracks to sediment
It's evident we're medicine for your whole town
Sky's the limit, game's definite when I'm in it
All window's is tinted, how you seein' me when I'm in it?
Rap, we got it on lock man, stop that
Put that mic back down, boy, drop that

Brooklyn (Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"*part one*
(Mos Def)
Hey hey, ha ha say what say what
Ha ha bust it yo
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, is beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here believe I'm on fire hey
Cuz it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day
Bust it, sometimes I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminesce on Bed-Stuy when I was pride and young
I used to try and come, to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little something
When I was just a youngin, before the days of thuggin
How me and Charlie Chims (aiyyo what?) I'm only buggin
Fast forward, Nine-Now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin the now space and time, round the nine to five
For as long as I'm alive, paw I got to strive
I ain't sittin roadside, that ain't part of the plan
I'm out here for my fam doin all that I can
I love my city, sweet and gritty inland to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown cuz we prone to outbursts
Philosophy redefine us, touch mines I touch back
Walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes over jakes (boomp-boomp!) we bust back
Bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game, black, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin to hunt that, recurring dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first hardest, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the Dutch many years ago
Three million strong, and here we go
*part two*
(Mos Def)
GOOD MORNINNNNNNNNNGG VIETNAM!!!
Ha (back up back up back up back up back up)*repeated in background*
Yo sometimes I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push ya wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Four on the jake got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro carding it
Thugs mobbin it, form partnership
Increase armorment, street pharmacist
Deep consequence, when you seek sleek ornaments
You get caught, rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real yo but still yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Out of towners take the train, plane and bus here
Must be something that they really want here
One year as a resident, deepest sentiment
They shout out, ""Go Brooklyn!"", they representin it
Sittin on they front stoop sippin Guinesses
Usin native dialect in they sentences
From the treeline blocks to the tenaments
To the Mom & Pop local shop menaces
Travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we it The Planet
Not a borough or a province, our style is uncommon
From ?sun? to the ? to the Lafayette Gardens
Wycoff, Gowanus in they army jacket linings
Yo this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya goin wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The nighties, and all my ?yarda trenny? Brown's Village
Parkside tennis court, thirties, forties, and the fifties
The cats out in Starrett City gettin busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Canarsie, Farragut, Fort Green, and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals of armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be, playin loud in Long B
If you love Bucktown STRONGLY!
RAISE IT UP!
*part three*
(Mos Def)
Brooklyn my habitat, the place where it happen at
Live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the News 2 crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, summertime jam is at
They play Big and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin you can't relax
The crack babies tryin to find where they mamma's at
It's off the handle black, wit big police scandals that
Turn into actions screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'lo gear is at
The stompin grounds, where you find a pound smokers that
Be blazin charm that have your wig cap floatin back
The doorstep where the disposessed posted at
Dope fiends out at Franklin Ave sellin zovarax
You big ballin better keep your money folded back
Cuz once the young guns notice that it's over, black
Brooklyn keep on takin it, worldwide we known for that
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat",https://genius.com/Yasiin-bey-brooklyn-freestyle-lyrics
Grown Man Business,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hear me, see me
Welcome to Soundview projects
Bronx, New York, 10473
Intersection action ribs touching
New gutter smacks replacing the whole Dutchman
Loose Mamis fucking, they definite land mines
Dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
Empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
Fighting federal cases with legal aids
The unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
Can get you in a 8 by 5, the Corner's younger
I smell, feel, touch and taste they hunger
Next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder
Under, wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
These niggas wanna be pistol Pete without the penalty
His last words, promise me this much in death
Don't let my boy live to retrace my steps
Minne, stay safe, move quiet and get it
If you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with it
Later amigo, digest the day to end discreetly
Sex money and boss
My ties to hear me see me
True villain
Face covered, driving gloves
Commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
They say that grown men lay on they prey
Took shorts in the street
Came back and made up for that with that white sheet
Revenge is best served cold
Get it the same way you give it
This ain't fear I just need to get away with it
Son, stop over here, you looking at me like I'm lame
But I'm looking at y'all like y'all call this the drug game
Grand child hosing sims
Put the heroin in Queens
Put pops freeman on in the early seventies
I sat in rooms with money machines
Drugs sitting 3 feet off of the floor
Cover the smell of the raw
Chest moves like bars scale my connects untimely
King Henry from 12th street flooded the Bronx in the 90's
03 scene MVP and one accord
Boss makes decision, paper wins awards
See me, hear me
Welcome to Brooklyn, New York City 11206
Roosevelt projects, wild rose water the plant
Son, you know what it is
From the moment that you come over the bridge
And if you don't ride with me
I'm gonna show you some shit
I'ma show you where my niggas stay sure on the mix
I'ma show you where the pain and the poetry is
Ghetto young's spend a lot of time alone in the crib
BET on the screen, walls and posters of big
Hustlers getting dough sitting low on the 6
Blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
Hop in the game knowing the risk
Still down to load up they clip
Gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
But when you hear head crack there ain't no rolling again
Snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
This how it happens, good people, bad habits
Diabetics, crack addicts, asthmatics
Searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet
The bible, the Quran, or the Ten crack Commandments
Speak on it God, what's today's mathematics
The five day forecast, the Dow Jones average
The price of beer, cigarettes, bread, milk and pampers
Life is a test and we all got the answer
The streets keep calling its hard not answer
And on my Government, my attribute, my all
So it's only natural I holla black and respond
Brooklyn stand up and make 'em all sit down
I call but no  we do not fuck around
That's what it is
All day
That's what is niggas
Official, official
That's how it is niggas
BX, Bk live all day
Get with it

Nadine,Cadillac Records: Music From the Motion Picture,2008.0,"As I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street
I shouted to the driver, ""Hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her, please let me off this bus""
Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I see you
Darling you got something else to do
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd tryin' to get to where she's at
I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat
Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, where are you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new
Downtown searching for her looking all around
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill told him, ""Catch that yellow cab""
Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?
Seems like every time I catch up with you
You're up to something new
She moves around like a wave of summer breeze
Go, driver, go, go, catch her for me please
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear
Nadine, honey, is that you?
Oh, Nadine, honey, is that you?

To the mothers and the children of the revolution
From 2Pac, to Afeni Shakur
And many many more
This is for you
One love, one life
Can you see.. the pride of the panther
As she nurtures.. her young all alone
It's the seed.. that must grow regardless
Of the fact that, it's been planted in stone
Can you see.. the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed.. that must come to harvest
It's the tree.. that must grow out of love

As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race?
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young, all alone?

Of the fact that it's planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
(black thought)
Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve
Trapped in a belly of hell
Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him
They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it
They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, (yo)
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted (or what)
Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your silhouette
Don't understand the point that you at
Or how the hell you came to it?
Flashback to images of that night, out in patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

Accuse a hurricane

Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

You built for that weather?
Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?
(common)
You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'what can become of kings and young kids? '
Summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from
Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising
Developing his knack to write
Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions
This picture proved to be bigger than black and white
A young soul named lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you
This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes

I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward (who you? )

You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me
You can't do much for me besides serve
Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully
Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me

Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for hurricane who (? ) patiently

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the hurricane carter rising
From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us
They had my man carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul
Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget

Man.. for real
I was in love with this girl, y'know
I was.. to' up dog! I'm tellin you man
She was wild man.. f'real
It's just too.. let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin out the fake cell phone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big thangs
Jewels chip, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the ave, spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi
Shot me a glance in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants
Hot damn!
What your name love, where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The slims at the Rebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance she was like 'yo, I'm leaving now'
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She sippin Crys straight up, shaking, winding her waist up
Scene two: my fam throwin the jam
For Reed is on the stand big things is in the plan
The brother Big Moon make space for me to move in
Hey, this my man Mos, baby let me introduce
I turn around
Say, you is the same pretty girl that I had priorly observed
Trying to play me for the herb (yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played it low and pretended I never met her
'How you feelin', 'oh I'm fine', 'my name is Mos', 'I'm Sharice'
I heard so much good about you its nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin directly next to me
I'm type polite but now I'm lookin at her skeptically
Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes, and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is *fucking* on me mentally
We conversated, made a laugh, yeah you know me bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet yo
I'm about to merc, I say peace to the family
She hop up like 'how you gonna leave before you dance with me?'

I know I can't afford this life
For a moment
That its too soon
To forget

She blew my whole habit, that girl
I was like 'what'
I played it low though, I was like 'yeah, aiight, c'mon then, let's go'
Its mad, it was so sick, I tell ya
Yo, honey was so blazin, she was just
Yo, she was like J. Kennedy
Word bond, to my mother man
She was that ill man, she take me to the dance floor
And she start whispering to me

Yo, let me apologize for the other night
I know it wasn't right
But baby you know what its like
Some brothers don't be coming right
I understand, I'm feeling you
Beside, 'can I have a dance?' ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playing lovers' rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heating my blood up like the Arizona summer song
Finished then she whisper 'honey, let's exchange numbers'
Scene three: weeks of datin late night conversation
In the crib heart racin, tryin to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin singing Gregory Issac
Like 'if I don't, if I don't, if I don't'
Showin me that tan line and that tatoo
Playin Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Burnin candles, all my other plans got canceled
Man I smashed it like an Idaho potato
She call my at my J.O., 'come now', I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin the p-funk
Cocking her knees up, champion lover not ease up
Three months, she call 'I feel I'm runnin a fever'
Six months, I'm tellin her I desperately need her
Nine months, flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down I'm really tryin to lock it down
Midnight we hook up and go at it
Burn is over, let her know, sweetheart I got to have it
She tellin me commitment is somethin she can't manage
Wake up the next morning, she gone like it was magic
Ahh damnit! My shit is all Harrison Ford frantic
My 911 wasn't answered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, who hit me up, I saw Sharice at the kiddie club
With some banging ass Asian playin lay it down and lick me up

With some banging ass Asian playing lay it down and lick me up

Ha hah
You know the deal
It's just me yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my peoples, negroes and latinos
And even the gringos
Yo, check it one for Charlie Hustle, two for Steady Rock
Three for the fourth comin live, future shock
It's five dimensions, six senses
Seven firmaments of heaven to hell, 8 Million Stories to tell
Nine planets faithfully keep in orbit
With the probable tenth, the universe expands length
The body of my text posess extra strength
Power-liftin powerless up, out of this, towerin inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop past all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects, prison-industry complex
Broken glass wall better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
But you chain cats get they CHA-POW, who dead now
Killin fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got, sixteen to thirty-two bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits, ever see my pockets like
Sixty-nine billion in the last twenty years
Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like
Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
Sixteen ounces to a pound, twenty more to a ki
A five minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear, everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess, Michael Jackson was right, ""You Are Not Alone""
Rock your hardhat black cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This new math is whippin motherfuckers ass
You wanna know how to rhyme you better learn how to add
It's mathematics
Chorus: scratched by DJ Premier (repeat 2X)
""The Mighty Mos Def..""
""It's simple mathematics"" - Fat Joe
""Check it out!""
""I revolve around science..""

Yo, it's one universal law but two sides to every story
Three strikes and you be in for life, manditory
Four MC's murdered in the last four years
I ain't tryin to be the fifth one, the millenium is here
Yo it's 6 Million Ways to Die, from the seven deadly thrills
Eight-year olds gettin found with 9 mill's
It's 10 P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal
He on the hill puffin krill to keep they belly filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers tryin to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new grind to get cream
The white unemployment rate, is nearly more than triple for black
So frontliners got they gun in your back
Bubblin crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin
Join the other five million under state supervision
This is business, no faces just lines and statistics
From your phone, your zip code, to S-S-I digits
The system break man child and women into figures
Two columns for who is, and who ain't niggas
Numbers is hardly real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret:
The million other straws underneath it - it's all mathematics

I saw Maybellenein a coup de ville
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford

She's bumper to bumber
Rollin' side by side

A medicine pill

Doin' a hundred
And ten gallopin' over that hill
Offhill curve, a downhill stretch
Me and that Cadillac neck by neck

The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and it started to rain
I tooted my horn for a passin' lead
The rain water blowin' all under my hood
I knew that was doin' my motor good

The motor cooled down, the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound

Watch me rip it on pacific and atlantic coasts
With the antidote, for the poisonous snake lies wit
Only wimps put the hiss on tape

Accompanied by shawn j. with the bid on bait
Put the grid on plate, on the ear or tray

Promised Land,Cadillac Records: Music From the Motion Picture,2008.0,"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia
California on my mind
I straddled that Greyhound, rode him into Raleigh
And on across to Caroline
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
We never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rollin' out of Georgia State
We had motor trouble
It turned into a struggle half way 'cross Alabama
And that 'Hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham
Right away I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi Clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
And there're people there who care a little 'bout me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hands
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land
Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
Oh, when the pilot told me in thirteen minutes
He would set us at the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk Virginia

Guns out when they jumped out, pointed at us
Here comes, what they call a procedure

So I figured I'd talk to her woman to woman
I walk in and she's countin her cash
Got so much cash her office looks like a green pasture
I said, ""Give him the little bit of money you owe him""
She said ""Get back bitch I ain't givin you shit""

We flew to a Jamaican paradise

Having money sure is nice

I don't quit, I don't quit
We 'bout to make this one a sure hit
Sean J. make the party people feel it
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like toduce
A very interesting young man that has traveled
From very far away to be with us tonight
Ha, ha, ha, what uh-huh
There is such a place that creates such a melody Brooklyn
No ladies, it's a living dream
It's a living dream, it's a living dream, love like this
Recognize all area crew
Whether you speak Japanese or goony goo goo
Son, when I come through, other rappers boo-hoo
'Cause they know they style's soft like baby doo-doo
I will continue to hit like a fifth of stolen Naya
Puttin' jokers on ice to get the cream like Breyer
No secret, Mos Def is the one that hunts a Mya
I get in my stance and set the dance on fire
Spread out my wings and I take the world higher
Peace to the fam magnetic in the Chi
Job-on, top Sean and my man Ahtu
And all my other clan who reside in the Zoo
Got a celebrated oatmeal broadcast crew
Mos Def gon' keep it naked like um fu-fu
(Andy)
Put it here to the tape like crazy glue
So when they bounce out of speakers they stick to you
The way that I communicate is non-typical
But high level like a 3-D visual
I hold the mic extensive, exhibit level and dimension
I radiate the space like a up-right bass
Son, I leave crews laced and escape wit no trace
Sound official like the finish time at a horse race
Here to put it in place for the nine-uno-seis
Mos Def set the pace, make your fam give chase
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
Universal magnetic b-boy, scientific
It's like that and you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm, you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
The universal magnetic b-boy, scientific y'all
You don't stop, it goes onto the rhythm, bust it
Baby, it's in my chromosomes to rock
Microphones sets who wanna test the M O
Best to leave that nigga alone
I make no bones or poems about droppin' bars
I make the world full swing under the Mos Def, yes
I ring the alarm like tennis sore
My style hella-raw, I keep it raw bone like Skeletor
And you should go and tell your clientele
That they need to get the message like Melle Mel
I got the locked like a Death Row show
And if I ain't a b-boy, premier never used a bell
(Ding, ding)
So tell your boy
(What?)
Crew to retire before I make they
(Ass)
Catch fire like Richard Pryor
Nondescriptive fiendin' for riches, callin' earths
(Bitches)
But most of y'all brothers is livin' with your mothers
Your boogie man yankin' up your covers
Sharper than some new box cutters on Parkay's and butters
And Stevie Wonder's to make you run and tell the others
The beat lovers and play my jam like the numbers
Son, I rock the globe like I rocked your boat
I'm 'bout to tap it on your shoulder 'cause you got to know
Now raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
The universal magnetic b-boy, scientific
Like that and you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm, you don't stop
And raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
Universal magnetic b-boy
(Hoo)
Scientific, you don't stop
It goes onto the rhythm, you don't stop
Raise your hands in the air, everybody get wit it
Universal magnetic b-boy, scientific
Like that and you don't stop
It go onto the rhythm, you don't stop
Now raise your hands in the air everybody get wit it

And let the world spin 'round and 'round
No matter how it spin
No matter how it spin it won't break me down
Turnt
It's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnin' again
Turnt, turnt
It's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnin'
And let the world spin 'round and 'round
No matter how it spin it won't break me down
It's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnt, it's turnin' again
Standin' at the threshold of labor and dreams
Biology of science from a family of psychics
Raised by the pious in a town known for pirates
Survive the bias and the slander
Witnessed the riots, all for the anthem
Proud of the Panther, phantom operatic master
The fresh organic, orgasmic, rapture
Constant cosmic, soul sonic
Flow at all points of arrival and departure
Strong and strange and raise and set anchor
Poise over anger, wise before danger
Say a prayer for haters and their broken...
Keep it...
