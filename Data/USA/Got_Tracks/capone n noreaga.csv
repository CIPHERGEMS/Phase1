"L.A., L.A.",The War Report,1997,"L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town
Cos we coming from Queens it gets down

Jose Luis Gotcha, golden guns and tons
General, Emanual,
 
Iraq emerald
Government out to get me, trying to stick me
Move quickly, yo the God study swiftly
Indian style, knees bent, hands together
Regulate, 
drop a cake in like each state
Money to make, first of the month son chop the weight
Break the law and got a score like before
Armageddon, marries street smoke wedding
Invest cheddar in shopping sprees in Reading

My crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats
Yo, we true to this black
4-4 likes to pour one to the dome, lubricate your thoughts
Black mask stole a ride to avoid up north
Jeopardize my freedom, blink out when I see him
But nine out of ten niggas wouldn't wanna be him
Rob him for his cash and spend it like per diem
Per diem, per diem, per diem
A-yo this rap shit is ill, kid you make mad dough but still
Hit your crew off so they can sling krills
Show some love kid ain't no selfish shit here
(
One love to that nigga Marley Marl
)

L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town
Cos we coming from Queens it gets down

I'm in too deep, losing sleep I can't call it
In love with this drug shit, loyal and all for it
What's a nigga to do, with no cash, and twenty-two?
Take it, or find out the best way to make it fast
My man's raking cash, fuck being lieutenant
I'm in it to win it so it might just take a minute
To gain grams, put my game plan in action
Ways to make it happen, today's to get the Jackson
Once the weight comes, I'm outta state triple sums
Stop my funds, I got guns to cripple sons
What's the use of heat, with no dough to flee the street
Caught a case with no trace of end, you're dead meat
Legal aid type of route'll have you shipped in greens
Ten thou for a lawyer now who splits your cream
Game is deeper than the sea itself
Agile moves that make fragile crews deflate under pressure
Take it to the next measure with all pleasure
And stack treasure, cheddar, illegal life forever

(
Open Sesame
)
(Yeah all together, 
like a butter soft leather
)

Been on this planet for twenty-five years and still strong
The world's rotten like the veins in my father's arm
I remain calm, study Islam, read the Torah
World going in flames like
 
Sodom and Gomorrah
Niggas dried up, laying in the box from the virus
Commercial thugs try to bust gats at the livest
This life of crime only will shine real survivors
Y'all half-way niggas, I advise you not to try this
So brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the sick Arabic Scarface
La ilaha illallah illallah
You're fucking with the God that's Gomar Oz Dubar
Official, my missile rips through your bone gristle
While you sneak thieving niggas get locked and blow the whistle
For the jake, my mouthpiece remains minute
Team made my bail, scooped me up in the Lex Coupe
Now I'm out, back to the galaxy of Queens
In between the crime scenes serving fans like fiends
Fiends, fiends, fiends, so it seems
Eternally, the game reverse and burn me
My man turned state's and took the one to three
Snitching on me, how could it be? We was team
I guess we got divided by the cream
FBI ran in my crib, where I live
Snatched my wife, child welfare took my kids
Yo I can't live, I got hit with double life bid
From the stress, my head throbbing like a tumor
Its one o'clock, make a salaat, I catch Jumu'ah
Lay down my towel slide off my suede Pumas
The rumors spread around the jail like that
Been down for six joints holding down this flat
Latin Kings do they thing, ice pick for gat
Trying to lay my God Body cats all on they back
But never that

Yo, QBC, Two-Five and Mobb Deep
Mami, rest in peace
In sha'Allah
One love to that nigga Marley Marl

L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town

Shoot up your block and make you know me
You ain't ready yet, slow down and recollect
Stay in the car, Astaghfiru 'lah bodyset
Ay yo Allahu Akbar, look paw, now I'm set
Air conditioned cooler system, yo, the tec glisten
On a mission, shoot your back out position
Found missing, 2-5 deep in prison
Kid listen, die on the cross like a Christian
So fuck you, plus your weak religion

Cash and hydro, eyes low
Looking Phillipine, divide dough
And regulate, empire state caked up
Raked up a hundred thou, now we all laced up

The finer wine and, cuisine sitting mastermindin'
Roundtable climbin to the Top Of New York
Won't stop, until we get dropped from New York

A million more, rookie cops thinking they live
We survive, game tight like virgin nappy
Feds on our back, tracin' Trag to murder Papi

Move fakers, get ya back blown in Jamaica
Lay you in the earth and curse you and your maker

Been doin this, since Mobb Six with Cormega
Gorilla, animal thugs be trife looking, your hearts tookin'
And got blown in Central Booking
I'm mad iller, organized thug killer
Now you little monkey niggas wanna play gorilla
Officially, Mussolini, pump heme
Insanity, temporarily my plea
And the jakes never worry me as long as I'm free
To my people holdin packs, nuthin less than a G
Crime side of life, foul price to pay
Illegal life, trigger trife till we old and gray
When the flesh dry up and the world decay
Reach heaven in a pearly white ACURAy
But until then, I'mma shine to the last sin
Resurrect through the birth of my son, and live again

Bloody Money,The War Report,1997.0,"New York get the Bloody Money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stash
You monkey walk, I'm hunchback, sneak quiet
Talk about me, gossip, scared to death when I pop up

I'm fouler than gats that don't bust when they supposed to
Been around you, play close, but wasn't close to you
The setup was weak, you coming
I saw you cuttin' corners, snake-type shit
Tie you up, seal your lip, wrist bleeding
Cowboy rope, choke your throat
Put the bogey out in your face
Now your face laced like ash tray face
Stay with gat on my waist
Give the god some space, 
shoot you up above waist
If I ain't got beef right here or right there
Ice-grill stare, shoulda set it off right there
CNN war report, spread across New York
Guard him Indian style - knees bent, militant
Yo the world know Noreaga from Iraq
Beef with me serious, keep it real, that's that
Get stabbed in your back, my man Alley Cat
Little cousin from Jamaica, brown-skin thug
Thug blood, yo we stuck in the game like it's a drug
My pops was a thug nigga, was on the streets too
Uncle Wise did biz since '82
Back on the streets, 
A hundred seven Guy Brew
I see you, come see you, writing scrolls (writing scrolls)
To the rest of the fam, locked in holes
At age eight, money come first, snatch purse
Go to church, yo that's not me, mami I'm cursed
Iblis glamorous, diabolic, devilish
This game real, realer than you think, just think
Spots get rushed, knots get touched, police busts
Yo what happened? Police kicked door, yo he was rappin'
Your wife - what what! What what! Dressed indecent
A hundred crackers, son it's the one-ten precinct

New York get the Bloody Money, dirty cash
Live niggas who smoke weed, car seat stash
You monkey walk, I'm hunchback, sneak quiet
Talk about me, gossip, scared to death when I pop up

Yo, time zone, cabron, maricon
Bitches callin me up, tryin to set me up
Like Amina and Gina, kid they from Medina
Emanuel
, 
keep fish scale to sell
General - 
clique deep with cartel
When niggas get locked, who you think they call for bail?
Shorty legs mad smooth, son, I'm left struck
Pussy plus dick could only equal a fuck
Fatty bangin', she analyze, my chain hangin'
We waitin, conversatin', 
Iblis Satan
Illegal life, watch police on bikes
Like Steel and Shame, they monkey wrenched the whole game
Stressed day, police watch from 12K
While I smoked shorty sipped Chardonnay
I lay - lay back, cognac
And I don't even drink like that, I sell crack
Yo my ices gleam, type mean, sell to fiends
Shoot guns, parallel
Pistol bust well
Kid whatever, desert storm like bad weather
Clique together, keep gats under the leather
You lightweight, what? I'm heavyweight hold weight
Yo it's jail niggas comin' home taking a shit
Yo illegal business, them niggas got dealt wit
Got smoked
God body cat
, he sniff coke
Yo he's old time, thinkin 'bout drinkin' his wine
Regulatin' 9-9, get my crew out, survive shootout
Tactics, keep gats under the mattress
Player hater - my team a bunch of regulator
Set you up, you won't make it to the elevator
You never been to jail, I'm jail seen
Niggas seen, me in jail since thirteen
Shooting up scenes
Real niggas take cream

My fans stuck with me, my shit still went gold
I got a habit just to drive, gettin head and I roam
CNN, we like the Grand Royal, I write rhymes with the Coke oil
Yo, Apollo heat
See me, sell leaf right we ride low creep
Got out the club, seen the police, Diallo deep
I'm like Frank Mathis, see me blow my dough
And any bitch givin head, if she blow I know
Oh no, we had to go see Primo
Taped it up, The Reunion, a brand new cut
Up in D&D, stayin with some rats and some sluts
From the projects, she know we need our welfare cut

Put my hand on the Bible, tell it to the judge

I'm dot com, I drop bombs, kill ya squad
Live like I'm still in the yard 'til I part with god
For my niggas in the Bridge, with the 50 dollar Panasonics and the blank 8's
Who wrap chronic

Whether we have not or have cake
We got gas to get that straight, we movin at a fast rate
My last case I got bail
My first one, man did indicted, how I write it, sister can't stand it
I smoke bud, get pissy, who could flow with me
Staggerin, bang like the wild Aficans
Spit gutter on this Premo beat, for the love of the street
An only child, my little brother was heat

Yo, yo, my guns is bilingual
You see my shit speak Spanish
Disappearing acts make your whole team vanish
From coast to coast I got them things
Badda-boom-badda-bing, meet the glorious king
Another album, another plaque, another ounce and another mac
Another chromed out gat
Another place to face where I lace you at
I put all type a wholes in ya face black

I spit records, and rep my necklace
Do the dog want beef? Right where the steps is
I walk the hood, niggas pay homage cause of my essence
It ain't nothing, I catch any charge, get out on bail

So fuck ya niggas too, them niggas can get it too
Them faggots act more bitch than you
Let the nigga rest in peace, and hop off his dick, bitch do you
And ya'll hoes is like ""Fuck Fox,"" well screw ya'll too

Sing Sing, straight convict
Strap the door, C-4, detonating shhh
Blow the spot, don't give a fuck who you go and get

And the cash that's in the stash, strip his Tommy drawers
Yo, check the crack of his ass

Nah kid, we on some real shit
Since we here, we might as well get all of it

CNN, desert men supreme order(word)

Akasi, three and a quarter, Arab Nazi
Me and shorty from the Mecca, having a session
Play the Shark Bar, sipping on French connection
On the rocks, son, hit me on the box
Time to hit the spot, regulate the whole fucking block

Grab the gray tape, gag his mouth, leave him for the rats
Stuck him for the yay-yo couldn't get the money back

So where you at?

Meet me uptown, by the Polo Grounds
Strapped with the vest, plus I got the 4-pound
Tell Caduece(tell who?), bring the A.K.(wha?)
So y'all can hold me down

Aight kiko, I'mma meet you in a hour, keep the free power close
Gotta get dun, and we ghost
Met Papi in Iraq(huh?), then winged by the back
Opened up the trunk, and threw in the big gat
Took off, threw the skully mask over the dome
We war prone, desert men tactics all shown
Met on 1-5-2, now we figure

Jheri Curl nigga, Dominican nigga who look Black
As I think back, transform coke to crack
Yo amigo, him and Rico, they got Perico
Son I know the spot, like the back of my hand
Networked the plan, we sticking him and his man
Working zip-lock, pop the lock, flee the spot
Grab the knot, national(hurry up! hurry up!)
Tell Willy come and get me on 160
I got three people with me, with trenches
We uptown waiting on the benches
The cab taking long, Dominicans coming strong
Claiming that it's on, from dusk 'til dawn
We right across the street, they don't see us
Ay yo, our Cuban disguise, it got us looking like we Jesus
Inshallah, we flee the spot mega far
Jump up in Willy's car, and scream ""Alhumdu Allah!""
25 people lost sleep, the other 25 lost heat(snitching)
And gave up Luis, and said it wasn't worth it
The CNN drug circuit, (yo) blind fold

To the chair, stay there, he just a power ranger

Jake hit the strip, now police try lockin us
It's laundry mat track, keep the loot in Iraq

It's cream on my land, original man, cross water
My team break border and court order
ESP network,
 TNT explosive expert
Your head jerk
Backflip, illegal life shit
Bad guys and black whips left the scene rowdy
Air cloudy, a bunch of smoke flow astoundly
New assembly, new identity, remember me
Keep remedy for the poison of my enemy
Martin Remy, Jack D to ali-ze
Yo, the Moe-T Dom P, personal Henny
Have me hurt many
Actions, coke infractions
Manuel and Fidel, our money well
Help the crack sell, stack bail, then we map trail
Get it all back
Smoke the black, hold the gat

The streets got me thinking bout my man's passing
Stashin, the lex with a passion, gotta make it happen
The block steamin' and 12 K the cops schemin'
Security be on my back for wrong reason
I'm livin' what I'm sayin' on the block all day
Before I wasn't sure, but now I know it's the way
Like, if I get caught I'mma pay
Illegal life, livin' trife, what can I say
Gettin bent, million dollar dream, Hennessee and Moët
While I'm chillin' with my man on the wooden set, Front
I strike accurate you get wet
Whatever choice you select handle appropriately
Baby 9, murder my crime, you a fake
Lefrak shine, just wait
I need half outta that cake of regulate
Taken while you scheme and contemplate
Only results in the 360 action
But if it come back, then I'm pumpin double action
Blastin, tearin' niggas physicals in
Try and contend, you gets no days with no wins
My clientele excel is like the devil's spell
Drove me to the streets young
So now I know it well

It's laundry mat track, keep the loot in Iraq
Iraq, see the world, the world see Iraq
Binoculars, eyes is out, sun they watchin' us
Jake hit the strip, now police try lockin us

Yo, son, I'm packin' steel, where ya hard hat
You pull out you bust that
Your gat useless, where ya heart at
It fingers the trigger, change ya name to fake nigga
Beef with every nigga, watch ya back
Of course, you get clapped, you didn't bust gat
Splendid nigga, dirty rat
For my Iraq attack, Bust you with mega gat
Once a cool cat, smokin 'dagger, put it in my back
Why you did it like that, now my skin bubble fat
Go to sleep, I wake you up

Binoculars, eyes is out, sun they watchin' us
Jake hit the strip, now police try lockin us

We on a mission, not a small time thing
I'm addicted to the cash like the crack head is a fiend to the crack
But I ain't into doin' no drugs, I'm just pushing hits
And stackin' chips like I'm stackin' bricks for a buildin'
Cause we be buildin' this empire fortress
Secured tight like barbed wire for infiltrators
Regulators, manipulate
Booby traps got you hooked like fish to bait
Watch you deflate like air balloon
Tryin' to ambush this platoon you run into a monsoon
Like stormy weather, your fatigues ain't tough as leather
Cause we bust bullets, Thinkin' much more clever
Eatin' through your gear like acid rain, feeling pain
Livin' like a snake in the grass, you won't gain
Simple and plain, my team play the game so we can win
We want it all so we can breathe like the wind

Bustin 360, cherry red 850
Iblis devilish, get cursed for fuckin' with me
Eyebrows thick, resemble Shatan
Arabian mind with source to firearm
Caesar, waves bangin', brown wallabees
Empty cigars stay smoked in cool cars
Queens Escobars wear jewels like scars
You heavy gold, Slick Rick, changed it
Yo, the main Vic, plottin' on you since eighty-six
Now it's nine-six, you lay low, you mad rich
Strictly big shit, big play heavy wait
While in car, hear a verse, put it in park
Let the dutch spark, now we ride my weed dark
Dig deeper, black guns and black reefer
My brother's keeper, throwing the world in a sleeper
The grim reaper, so much work he got a beeper
The word death, stamped that, it's on your chest

I did 'cause I had to discipline niggas, knahmsayin'?
Eatin' like he live, he ain't live, word up
Nobody can't eat if I can't, word up
If I can't eat, God, don't let nobody eat, God
You ain't live - I'll eat ya food kid
I'll take your food, it's on
It's on now.. word up
'Cause he's a halfway - thug that he portray
If you got locked that ass'd probably come home gay
Smack, blood out ya mouth (what the fuck you say?)
Break your feeble ass down ('cause you ain't in my league)
...Somethin' you don't need

Yo, now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black?
I used to peddle crack, you never sold drugs so stop frontin'
I pushed the war button, you cold panicked
Use tools to fix ya fuckin' face like a mechanic
Dramatic, dynamic, and underhanded
You say the shit that I say, for so long I can't stand it
The God bandit, erupt like volcano
Shittin' lava, right on they armor, you blood(?) farmer
What Wha? Khazer, gato, nuto cuatro(??)
Imbalance the scales of slaughter, Iraq discipline
Open ya face, spit on the cut, pour the Henny in
Sweetpea, fuck with Popeye, get smoked properly
It ain't even got to be, handled on record
Just me and you, one on one, I'm only one
Yo, the only one, sixteen  alphabet
Your power counterfeit, fraudulent, fraudulent yo
Who's fascinated? I get highly lifted and upgraded
You playa hate it, bite me before I made it
My opposition, competition ya code scratched
Like gats without, serial numbers that don't match
CNN form, Genghis Khan, Art of War
Yo you weak minded, dumb deaf the nigga blinded
Left behind in, lost and found you can't find it
John the Baptist, observe, mad water
Surveillance my style, exile, feeble and fragile
Not one crew, fuck you up like we do
252 (25 to life kid) CNN will shoot right through
Set it off (what) break you off, just like a big brick
Chop that shit, mix and, contaminate it
Navigate it, 2-5 the most hated
My satellite will orbit in rap, planet's my oxygen
We poppin' it, kick through door, do-rag and moccasin
You can't stop, Lieutenant Arab
Thirsty to have what you have
Bust a new trey, Illuminati be the new age
Masquerade courageous, loud and boisterous in three stages
They try to get my dunn twist in cages
So get the word spread, spread it like love
You halfway - thug nigga, you portray
Yo I used to hang around with y'all, cover ground with y'all
Now I flip, turn around and pull the pound on y'all
Dissolve, that weak shit, you thought just revolved
Like the Earth at its axis, I got access, to map this
Pure blackness, yo attack this - blood sucker of the poor
My power show and prove, livin' on the 5th floor
We at war, with the foolish
Get deducted, lose points, they can't do this

You either make it or you take it
If the game's in you, dedicated stay true
Illegal Life

Yo, I was in Ramada, laid up with 
Goldschlager
Jungle room
, cowboy hat around June
Monaga, had the 45th draga
Capone-N-Noreaga, the saga, sega, mega, network and bodega
Dream marvellous, scandalous, black mantis
Illegal life is like my A-alike
We B-Alike, hustle night to life
Desert storm, and cold form on your dorm
Run through, 
hard-boil you like John Woo
The law we hate, drop a cake cut like mix tape
Spoil coke plate, you buying fake weight
The next day, contemplate and score jake
Jesus, conduce, 
claim Bishop in Juice
Bloody up your goose, now who scream for truce
Lefrak is Iraq, illegal life contract
Keep 'em back, load up the big macs


We hate the law, escalated war with jake, raise the crime rate
Criminal minds regulate the tri-state
The legacy it never end, illegal life veteran salute
Get loot and stay true, corrupt jake make it happen
Snatch 'em catching oz's, put the game on freeze
Dedicated hustling won't stop regardless
Whatever charges, getting the dough til you go
Observation, direct sale, connects giving, reaching for ceiling
On the streets again, wild born, the enemy became your best friend
Meet the game closer, mapped out many ways to get rich
 Ay yo, for real crime pays

9 6 the deal, we real about this cheddar, forever
Corner standing, in any weather, heat holding you down
Controlling your ground, stick-up kids come around
And taste the pound, CNN, put our soul on the line
For this life of crime, 2 5 forever shine

9 6 stay hungry, son collect monthly
While the streets change, me and my man remain tough (ly)


C A P O N E with me, Papi, Hav and Pee
Tragedy Khadafi, N O Y D, a man and me
On some mobb shhh, spark up cigar shhh
Cubans sit back jack, my niggas smoke dat
Generate, be the coke razor on a coke plate
Back up the crime son, and try to see a triple double
And get my loot back on a time table
Ay yo it's CNN, you soon to see us on cable
At the round table, networked through the label

2 5 circle, caught you snitching now we hurt you
Fake Scarface, coming out your mouth all loose
He think he thugging it, ice mugging it
‘Cause he drugging it
My rap loot, I still shoot
Ask Irak (Lefrak), you better bust back
Keep it like that

The heat is god
Guard me, like bodyguard

Guerrilla form all in your dorm

Weak trick - go ‘head and snitch like your man did
War Report, cut ya life short
Babe Ruth niggas ain't ready for blood sport
Yo, we masked up, pointing the heat
Duct-tapin' her, gag her mouth so she can't scream
Start rapin' her
Camcorder, you won't miss it ‘cause we taping her, rapin' her
Fed Ex, you got the tape next day in the mail

I migrate—Queens, Jamaica, Brooklyn—gets sunnin'
All feelings though, we all grow wit this ?buckle?
I recognized life is a deal, cards and a shuffle
Everything revolves around me, I couldn't see that
25 to Life and hip-hop, you got the feedback
Who need that, hundred grand stashed up in a G-stack
We fo' black, want more trip, we get that old back
And keep this world high, yearly raw supply
These fuckin' tracks have a nigga feelin' wide inside
Any bottle-tip high smokin' lah in the rye
It's on you, if you wanna take heed the hidden treasure

Explode on, roll on, fold on, Ghengis Khan
Dusk till dawn Art of War
Still time to score, yo we kid we poly for
Yo Victoria's Secret bitches that suck dick raw
The freak, Rick James type

Kick doors in, snake four-fours in
Yo escape the Nor-van, swervin', TV's inside Suburban
Iraq dishieke, diamond cut pinky
Listen to Trag shit wit Noyd and Chinky
Network like the internet, wit Henny wet
Nine-oh be my set, so whatever be next

Shorty came through, she iced out and dressed in blue
Said she move from Brooklyn, reside in secion two
Know how we do out here ho, a two for square
Get high, and disappear play the projects on super-low
Plus she feelin' my style, 
Too Hot like Coolio
Plus her cooty though, bangin' just like the studio
From Iraq to Inglewood, it all good
From hood to hood, regulate like a thug should
Yo we in too deep, losin' sleep and can't call it
The game is still fresh until the jake try to spoil it

Be the first who turn around and try to spike you

How your life is yo?

My life is nothing like a sitcom, you see I sip Dom
I rock Jor-dan's, and can't stand Pip-pen's
Bases loaded, coach want me to bunt
But I'mma go for the homer and cock the pump
I was the kid in the hood your moms ain't want you with
Now I'm rich, tell your moms one-two click
Since a young one, I love heaven and love hell
Escobar style, I'll build my own jail
The America's, 'merica's, favorite thug
To sell cocaine, America's, favorite drugs

And the hoes don't fuck, they just brain niggas

I erase drama and talk, memories in my rap
It's kinda hard to rap on radio while I sit in the box
All I could think was money, send a few flicks to my pops
I give the street life my all, stripes and scars
Nights was hard, felt I had a right to rob
Now I spit righteous bars, FUCK livin like the stars
Give me a hood crib and a Chrysler Dodge
Cause I'm just like y'all, my kicks scuff like y'all
I still get harassed and searched up like y'all


Yo, imagine us cowards
You still live with mommy, still get allowance
I chase Henny, bubblin ounces
I returned off a short stretch, stuck in the mountains
What's this I hear huh? This is my year
'Pone shit kosher you think not? I give you my ear
Now listen closer I was born, and I'mma die here
Listen soldier, I rap and keep one in the holster

Knock you out position, and have your little ho missin

Brown bags - tons of hash get smoked
Yo that real shit - pro'ly make you bleed down your throat

I smoke spanky - hit it hard, mega hard
Then burn it down under the ground around guard
I rented - bitch on my dick then I presented
Diploma - keep her wide open in Tony Roma
Back shots - Holiday Inn about to bone her
And cold own her - drop her off inside Corona

And a dime's finesse
Titanium chest and bubble vest

D's wanna plant keys on me
Eternally I wanna sleep
Without the venom of a snake nigga tryin' to creep
Stakes is high and a thug's blood runs deep
The Jakes wanna see me layin' under six feet
Or so it seems, now my team work against me
They can't stop my money move - it's too intensely

I'm like Moses in the middle of the Red Sea

Word up word up always look in the sky yo. (Yeah I always did that too yo). And
Ask why. Why it gotta be like this?
Why do we have to struggle?
Kila Bee rest in peace yo (Killa Bee
Rest in peace)
Word up (word up) ? Prayers ain't never end (prayer's ain't
Never end)
""Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe""
*Noreaga*
Yo I started out in Iraq the wrong route
More chickens to doubt more money to count
Yo my Swiss account with more cheese amount
It's still piling and still gettin' calls from the island
Still do the things I do when I was wildin'
Tryin' to go from penny loafers to mink sofas
Spend a week with dime chickens that's freaks
*Hook*
If you don't know (if you don't know)
Knowlegde is what makes thugs grow
Just stay on point cause you reep what you sew
*Noreaga*
Yo ass cheeks scream loud like car beeps
I wanna be under the seats in our streets
Last year around the time this year
If I would of got locked Yo
I wouldn't even care
But now I got this rap thing (what)
No more hustlin' at age ten my team played to win
We're here to succeed
Sonny carson nobody understanding
Yo the black struggle gotta hustle to hustle
And once you get muscle nobody trust you
Tryin' to be like Goldy in the Shaft days
These lasts days comin' up
Yo these little niggas comin' up
Get their gun tucked ready to buck
Not thinkin'
Black on black crime yo it's swine you're both stinkin'
Pretty Ake yo Shan and Mahdi
Yo its Papi, officially arab nazi
2-5-2 we regulate this what
*Hook*
Said I wanna be closer to this paper (get close)
Ooooh get closer to these ends
""Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe""
Closer to this paper get closer to this paper (hella dope baby)
Get closer to these ends
""Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe""
*Noreaga*
Yo I remember when we first did it
Nobody with it
Label said 2-5 is too thugged out (to thugged out)
So although we had to but God wasn't glad to
Wait our turn to boil now we burn
On the daily done fuckin' in every telly
We can Fly just like R.Kelly
The moon is secondary to the sun
I think I gotta son but I ain't sure
What's in store, God there's more
Shortie says the kid mine knockin' at my door
Could it be? tryin' to be what I can be
Islami 2-5 my army
Said she about to have my seed
Soon to be it shocked me
Thinkin' bout a little me
Eternally I bleed thinkin' of seed yo at high speed
I multiply with weed
Now I slow my life down I got time to breathe What?
*Outro*
Said I wanna be closer to this paper (get close)
Ooooh get closer to these ends

Closer to this paper get closer to this paper (hella dope baby)

Married to Marijuana,Clue for President: Vote Clumanatti,UnKnown,"Noreaga - “Married to Marijuana”


Female 1: Yo, why the fuck you just don’t leave that nigga Nore alone?
Female 2: You don’t understand.  I love him
Female 1: But he ain’t feeling you
Female 2: He’s feeling me
Female 1: He’s feeling that other bitch
Female 2: Nah
Female 1: Face it: when he goes to the studio, she’s there, waiting for him
Female 2: What?
Female 1: When he’s writing she there next to him
Female 2: Fuck out of here
Female 1: When you page him and he don’t call you back, who you think he be with?
Female 2: Yo, I guess I lost my man to that bitch

Ayyo, married
To Marijuana, stabilized persona
I bone the bitch anytime I wanna.  It feel good
Just to see her in all-black, looking all that
Tell her I’d like to be with her, every night, sleep with her
Some sneak you in jail, open your nappy walls
Like bullet-hole sores, smoke you out during intercourse
I’m jealous knowing that you’re resting with them fellas on the
Other side, niggas I don’t fuck with, don’t even talk to
The way they act, I could see they hawk you, and when
I roll, it’s like I undress you.  When I smoke, it’s like
I done blessed you.  Taste is the best, travel
Across ocean, West-Coasting, searching for the potent
I ain’t wanna eat, you mistreat (What?!?)
I thug you out and let my duns hit you—menáge
It’s two of y’all: hydro and black tar
Rap seminar, me and Akbar, dusty cigar
Noreaga, N-O-R-E-A-G-A, got
AK, fuck more bitches around way than the
Average nigga ‘cause most niggas is broke niggas, get their
Drink on.  I get my dick on, but, word bond, I had this
One bitch that led me on, smelled like
Baby powder, got out the shower ‘round the god hour, told me
“My love stronger, last longer
Like a Duracell, keep ticking.”  I’m long-dicking
Stroking her down, provoking her now to go down
Stroking her down, stroking her down

I get high now, I get high now (Get high)
I get high now (Get high now)

Yo, and to the
Chicks that get high with me, smoke lye with me
Come on, girl, why don’t you come around my world?  And to the
Chicks that get high with me, smoke lye with me
Come on, girl, why don’t you come around my world?  And to the
Chicks that get high with me, smoke lye with me
Come on, girl, why don’t you come around my world?

My world (My world), my world (My world)
My world (My world).  I’m still alive, full of lye

Get high, baby.  Ain’t nothing wrong with smoking a little reefer.  I’m still alive, mad lye.  Lye, mad lye, mad lye.  (Married to marijuana) Married to marijuana.  (Got a nigga whipped) Got a nigga whipped, yo.  I’m whipped off of that shit

Yo
When I first fucked you, I admit I didn’t like it
It felt like my brain got kicked, somebody spiked it.  It
Was in the bathroom.  I consumed mad boom
Going back to my women smelling like perfume
Started arguments, mad commotion, thinking that I’m joking
When I said I wasn’t stroking, was only toking
She didn’t believe me, called up Mussolini
“Yo, where dun at?  Where he was at last night?”
Asking mad questions, interrogating smoking sessions
The last lesson: I get high—that’s true confession
From Iraq to El Segundo, I hold a gun though
And get high for all my niggas living on the run though
I’m living this, doing this since the days of K-Swiss
Helados, popping bottles, some family resign
We live the life of crime, niggas, and shine
What, what?

Get high (Get high).  Get high, nigga (Get high, nigga).  Get high, nigga (Get high, nigga).  Get high (Get high)",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-married-to-marijuana-lyrics

Yo, blood scene, bloody my vision can't see

Roll dice, and break 'em on the street corner
Betting stacks, holding packs

Hoping police don't run deep on us
Peep the third floor shade that never rises
For Jake, I hold weight, plus gats in greater sizes
Bulletproof down to my Nike's now who the livest
Survivest,

B EZ,The Reunion,2000.0,"I heard that nigga Capone's home, yo—word to Motha—that nigga Nore' doin' his mothafuckin' thing
Thugged Out Entertainment—knowwhatI'msayin'? Niggas still in the streets
Ill—Will—Braveheart, nigga, there's a thin line between streets and
Business, so we gotta have balance and be easy

Yo, yo I heard you fags wanna catch me off guard
Put TECs to my heart, the death of Escobar
Under your breath, whispers in the dark
I hear it cause the street ain't loyal to choose sides
Prepare for the beef, whoever lose dies
Rich and I'm thuggin'
I can't trust nothin', this bitch that I'm fuckin'
This clip that I'm bustin' could jam in my fist
Look at my hand, finger pussy with expensive rings
Cut coke cookies, wrote poetry
And broke noses B
Voice is Heaven
I'm God's son, of course a legend
This is part 1, speak my sermon, the hood reverand
Blunted eyes red
C-Class, a Hundred times Five Red
CD's blast, speed fast, haters drop dead
I'm gorgeous
Black Goddess flip the arm rest, grab the cordless
Her body stacks the best, ass is flawless
Finally, the long awaited shit, ghetto people
The sequel—Nas, CNN—nobody's equal

Yo—be easy, keep the club off the heezy
See us thug in the back and drink creezy
Be easy—see, we still smoke treesy
See us rippin' the stage with Downlee—
Be easy, keep the club off the heezy
See us thug in the back and drink creezy
Be easy—smoke treesy
See us rippin' the shows with Downleezy

Niggas picked me the boss—Ricky Ross
Lex Two-Fifty Horse power, click and devour the source
If it's flour then swallow your loss
I cock Fours, kick in Poppi's doors
All for the cash and the cause
Niggas break big fractions of laws
So what, we got it sewn up, smack every cat on the board
I speak the truth, guns spit at you, shakin' my palm
It's pitiful, wavin' my wand
The Don, a Hundred follow me like Farrakhan
Chasin' my Henny, embrace Benny's
It's quite Frank, my niggas 'll kill, never waste a Penny
Money stay well invested
Feel the weight on my necklace
When death is too close flip the next shit
Thug the game out
Bust biscuits, pull the Range out
Public enemy—QueensBridge where I hang out
Sweet scent of weed I wear like a fragrance
My energy's kinetic, mind power type ancient

Yo—be easy, keep the club off the heezy
See us thug in the back and drink creezy
Be easy—see, we still smoke treesy
See us rippin' the stage with Downlee—
Be easy, keep the club off the heezy
And we thug in the back and drink creezy
Be easy—smoke treesy
See us rippin' the shows with Downleezy

I see death through the corner, die, kingdom come
Six 500's, pull up right in front of the slum
Sticky green fingers soldiers of the great God
Clarence spoke to the poor but he lived in Oz
An ill hook like Roy Jones, I'm a street-corner bastard
And crush weed with the hashish
Bandana head dome wrapped
Caddy trucks with the grills and the chrome snaps
I'm on point like Al Sharpton, come peep the M.U. marksman
The S-Class is shittin' on your weak Datsun
Graffiti written on the Bible, my life is wicked
I see dead corpses, and Rolls Royces
Put your heart on your lap, listen you hear voices
My whole persona is the drama and to smoke skama
I can lift it up, Willy what in front of your slut
Money bustin out my pocket, your bank is stopped

Yo—be easy, keep the club off the heezy
See us thug in the back and drink creezy
Be easy—see, we still smoke treesy
See us rippin' the stage with Downlee—
Be easy, keep the club off the heezy
And we thug in the back and drink creezy
Be easy—smoke treesy

If you want it, you got it forever
If you want it
I like your stockings, stretch socks even your Reeboks
Thug you out, take you on tour, to all the weed spots
We can sip wine, bump and grind on the slow-mo
But on the d-low I heard your man was a homo
We can combine just like Two-Five and DoLo
Tell me where to put it like solo
Meet me at 702 I like your steelo
Now boo face it, you're bangin' to your ankle bracelet
I went against the grain when I said I'd never taste it
You work all day come home ready for foreplay
Your favorite dish, hominy grits and fish sauté
You love a thug boo, highly impressed by my tattoo
Slim cut, walk with a strut keepin' it natural
Your physical frame is like a Jada Pinkett
I like to hear you moan, spank it grab your X and O anklet
Freak off

If you want it, you got it forever
If you want it
If you want it you got it forever
Sick and tired of your wannabe thug he got you heated
Knowin' that you need it but he's still afraid to eat it
Friday night you tell him that you out with the girls
But you're zonin' in my world gettin' bent till you hurl
I got the fireplace, bearskin rug so kick your feet out
Hit me on the hip eight hundred I got the weed out
Hydro keep it on low now bust the weed out
Slide off the DKNY's so I can eat out
Jump inside a jet black 5 or watch you speed out
Adrenaline got you open like a stack of Benjamin's
Then back to the Bennigan's to eatin' pasta with Dominicans
Eat it up

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm like Rich Porter, the epitome of Alpo
AZ and Nicky Barnes, I rock sticky thumbs
I chopped it, and I cooked till my hands got numb
Shotguns malt-liquor and ones
I used to pay homage and wanted to play to be a fat cat
Someone like Castro, mad cash flow
Me and 'Pone like the best in the business
Niggas show love, hoes show interest
My gun game - got my pops to blame
I used to hop over fences and buck in the rain
And I'm not that nigga that'll fuck ya dame
I'm true to my niggas, hop out the car
Hand on my mac, cock back, ready to clap
Up in Iraq, see my niggas hustlin' crack
The same scheme from Queens when you livin' your dreams
You gotta sell things if you're looking for fiends

All we got is us

I know crips, yo crips even be in Iraq
I know young bloods and niggas like O.G. Mack
I dropped out in seventh grade and I knew I'd be straight
I went O.T. and then I copped bricks for eight
I cut black bitches off for at least three weeks
I had Spanish hoes spittin nuts on the seats
I see Jesus in my kids but it's silly to me
How I see Him in them, don't see Him in me

I blanks out, my nigga knight just hit the bricks
I'm not a rapper, I sell alot of crack but spit
Niggas that I'm cool with, I only keep a nigga hot
Say I'm on some new shit, then I cock the pop
The other side of the game, doin' fifty y'all
I survived behind the wall and the feds for y'all
Similar to ""Hurricane,"" harassed half my life
I got a right to flash my ice, crash the Vipe


When everything goes sour, I got my dog
I squeezed off went through the pound and locked my doors
I'm not scared of your guns, I got shot before
Niggas' jewels got little rocks like Arkansas
I'm the, prophet of B.I.G., but never the next
I'm the first in every verse spit shit get worse
You can hate me, or wish I'd lie in a hearse
Respect my game, who the best? Select my name
I salute niggas in jail, I'm big as Latrell
On the street, you need heat? Ask Dominican Will
My cliqua's off the meter, we come gunnin' bullets
Whistle past your ear, like police in London
We the best that ever did it, the rest never lived it
Gettin' bucked at a bing-time, stressed on a visit
I'm Y2K in a flesh, the future at it's best
Nevertheless I pop metal to death


Yeah! Dedicated to Rich Porter little brother
Who died in the struggle and never got recognized for it!

Outlaw, Outlaw
Uhh-uhh. Yo give me some of that haze man. That purple haze
I don't wanna smoke that fucking haze wit this wood no more
Hydro. Shit got my hydro tasting like smydro
I'ma smoke a straight haze right now.(straight haze)
Pone roll up there. ya heard me?
Yo Slaam roll up there ya heard me? Ok Slaam
It's like this yo...
(Noreaga)
Yo, yo Blood money is the anthem, its never a myth
I smoke weed and I get drunk, and ride with gifts
If I don't roll, then my nigga Baby he just twist
He rolls Phillies and he busts the big the four-fifth
See shit change because I normally came
On the R train now me and 5 in the Range
We used to twist Phillies and fuck hoes, switch cars and trade guns
Them Queens niggas then we landed in the millions
Iraq and the Bridge, the only difference is the buildings
The same crime rates and the same damn killings
A slice of pizza, and quarter water my juice
But now I'm Carhart and bullet proof is under my goose
And go to hell to that nigga that snitched on deuce
The curly-haired fro, I cut my hair but my beard grow
Yo where my beers go?  Send them right here yo
Yo party's over tell the rest of the crew
Stash the drugs, the guns go to section two
See me, all my life yo I had to sell drugs
While you grew up with straight nerds I grew up with thugs
While you grew up with straight nerds I grew up with thugs
(Chorus: Complexions)
Through the test of time, I strive to get my shine
Upon them lives, slanging rocks cuz the world is mine
I look out for you, and you look out for me
And we hold it down, you just wait and see
Platinum chains and Carti' frames and jewels
Now these broke niggas start to act a fool
Don't you know Thugged Out straight eat ya food
We keep guns on our sides, you know how dunn thugs do
Cause I'll be there with my thugs
I'll be right here waiting on you
(Capone)
For my niggas who bust pies
The customized fives
To the vals, to the railroaded trails I cuss cops
Enough shots and any generation
I spit dead a plot in the making I ride for every thug in the basement
My soul is cuffed to the corner, every gate, every car table
Every welcome to the hood sign
Batting good times
Its on over the projects a dark cloud one sided
Till death bitches burning in gossip
Its my turn to deposit
The real, the logic, no college
Just dollars and criminal knowledge
Me and my codies, pass ?rodies?
I flash mo' wheat, than cash Cody
Keep the mac on me
When U stack niggas act phony
Shit in the ghetto, I spread love and shed blood
Never swear to a dead thug
My name should be brough up in fame
Never said in vain
Spread like a letter chain
In criminal slang
(Chorus)
We done had some time
I strive to get my shine
On the block, slanging rocks cuz the world is mine
I look out for you, and you look out for me
And we hold it down, you just wait and see
Platinum chains and ?cardy? frames and jewells
Now these broke niggas start act a fool
Don't you know thugged out, straight eat ya food
We keep guns on our sides
You know how dunn thugs do
Cuz I'll be there with my thugs
I'll be right here waiting on you

Pain,The War Report 2: Report the War,2010.0,"From CNN world international, this is world news
*gunshot*
I don't think there is such a thing as a good war
There are sometimes necessary wars
It was something that had to be done
The real war involves getting down there and killing people
And being killed yourself or just barely escaping
It gives you attitudes about God, life and death
That are unattainable anywhere else
I'm not sure I can speak about why human beings in general go to war
I think that's a large category, they go to war because it's impossible not to
Being shot, you saw them fall, because these things you saw
And the fact that this is for real...

Unh!! Unh!! Unh!! Yo, yo!!
Waking up, cold in my eyes, two phillies ready rolled on the dresser
My chick hatin', I won't stress her
Probably get her mad and pay attention much lesser
Hit the closet up, brush my teeth and get fresher
These things real you can bring your diamond tester
I see through your glass my dude, like Large Professor
My nigga died that night, lampin on the park bench
I'm kinda hurt, I ain't been back to the park since
See I'm a Jihadist, high like comets
And I ain't with the shit, I despise all the garments
Demise what you garbage, your whole team is green littered
Which means your target's not safe in the markets
I inherit niggas beef quite frequently, that's why they call me Warrior N.O.R.E
When they speak of me, Gangsta, Monster Kody, parolee
I'm on my Din, Hakeem, Allahu Akbar
Swing big swords, cut in half a cop car
My nigga Truth rock stock rims Magnum
Fuck them groupie hoes cause we been done had them
Bust nuts off, lower they facial
I'm a Geto Boy like Bushwick and Face
And I always had a record, I was born with a case
I feel pain

Been through it all in my life
I done watched close niggas to me die by the gun and the knife
(I feel pain)
This for niggas on they own or locked up on the phone
And they never comin home, y'know? (I feel pain)
Look what happened to Haiti it's all crazy
Everynight I go to sleep and kiss my baby
(I feel pain)
Everyday the same story, war hustle, territory
We just try'na see the glory, y'know?

Ayo it's fucked up my nigga Black Box died on christmas eve
My other homie on his birthday
Now we on the block thinkin revenge, not hearin what his Earth say
Lookin at his seed make me want it in the worst way
Besides that my other nigga got cancer and just found out that his wife is a dancer
So many questions all I need is an answer
I done did so much dirt ain't no room in the hamper, check it
I got scars on top of scars, William Wallace renegade
Most of you niggas sweeter than lemonade
We bloody up your garments, nigga this is phonics
I ain't speakin in ebonics take my words as a promise
Get Obama on the line tell him raise the threat level
We the last real niggas standin when the dust settle
When it's war dunn, the beef never stops
It comes right back around like the hands on a watch
Army fatigue, fox, 40 below Timbs
501 Denims, coca sales with no lens
Just to see the snakes clear cause I ain't got no friends
Only my brother from another mother we goes in
My gun' the alarm, bullets fatter than Big Mama
To deal wit' the pain I smoke scamah (I feel pain)",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-pain-lyrics

To plenty coke poppin, takin my workers shoppin
Had enough of these foreigners, playin wit my coke
Told papi, yo this tan shit is gettin me broke
Fuck twenty a gram, gettin garbage
I paid thirty for the product, plus I heard Fernando got it
Dope cheap around 151st street, push the anniversary Range
With the first seats we met through Chico a while back
When I copped petty coke, from his main E-O
In the building six three oh
He knew I wasn't playin, I came clappin
9-6 put my deal on the line, nigga fuck rappin, check what happened
I told him put papi on the horn
Words was spoke from there, duke said it was on
We met in the rain, fuck it no need to explain
Think back to War Report, just to freshen your brain

Yeah we thugged out, niggas that'll slap the mayor
Chime on haters, niggas see me shine my gators
Cock the gauges, down we be rippin the stages, what nigga

Niggas wanna place a stake in my chest, lay me to rest
The projects display me the best, crazy begets
I get 'em my babies, willie my eighties
Shit with a Ac white Mercedes, buggin here like my rims eighty
Bulletproof glass and frame, I smash the game

Yo, I gots no name, I cause pain, people'll cry
My size vary at the murder scenes, homocide bag me
Try to trace me back to my leader
I put niggas in chairs to pine boxes way up under the stairs
Niggas use red dots, make me follow they path
I hit cops, they be raw, tip is ten thou' cash
I'm metamorphic, I'm forced to switch
Dum-dums to hollow tips; unfortunate, you can buy me legit
I get heated when I seperate my shell
With the pin in my back, I bang like (?) I got some nerve
They jam right? But I still get respect and heard
I hit niggas legs for fame, my lead through, shit in the game
I leave a red stain whenever I'm sprayin
I'm known as the B-U-double-L-E-T, and S-L-U-G
Enough'll make you D-I-E, Queens Finest (yeah yeah)

Yo stolen car -- top down, on point -- real route
Set it off -- thug it out, pull a heist -- peel out
Fingerprints -- ain't none, black mask -- no face
Cash flow -- no sweat, Jakes come -- no trace

It's so simple Dunn I'm down and don't fuck around
Comb the hood, in two black Excursions
Lookin for this nigga so we can merc him
Parked in front of his building for like two hours
Been around the corner for a few hours
Came back, there he go, let's go, that nigga ours
Hopped out the truck, went right at the coward
The gun showers, rain on these niggas they frontin
He didn't even saw it comin..
Hopped back up in the trucks, light the tree back up
I need that Dunn, havin to deal, with these fake niggas
And fake bitches, give me that Dutch, it's never enough
Niggas O.D. off of us (Queens Finest)
It's never enough, bitches O.D. off of us (yeah yeah)

Mad traffic, and I still buddy whack it
Put your name on the affadavit
Just to save it, the project ghetto favorite
Laundry mat trap, the Yacub and the rat
Bill Clinton of the ghetto, respect my name
Tecs and 'caine, the rains nearly stretched the lane
Ridiculous, how my shit spit, fake fishes
Non-religious, Christians won't pay visits
Fast for a month, and mix a lot in the trunk
Ice fuckin full of skunk, double barrel of pump
Kick rhymes like priests, I'm a golden boy
I got a brand new whip, and it's stolen boy
Fiends love me, they see I'm still holdin void

Watch me flow, a nigga like me all about dough
Bonin' your ho, and have her hard to find like 'dro
You know we Range Rov', come through, tinted lay low

Don't give a fuck about you..you...


It's Thugged Out Entertainment nigga
Straight like that
We cut, shoot, stab, sell crack
Straight like that
We eat, sleep, shit street life
Straight like that
We get knocked bail the same night
Straight like that

We gettin bitches, bitches, money, money, basically
There ain't no kissin, we just fuckin honeys, basically
You see y'all snitchin niggas talkin funny, basically
Me and my niggas is known to keep it ugly, basically

I'm off Beezlebub, I walk wit the mac in my sweats
Air forces, wife beater, fitted cap to the left
My chain hang 35 inches, my heat 7 and a quarter
Beard 8 and a third, and my piece be Orca
There's no need for peace offers, my niggas be shootin, we riot
We run the streets quiet, cuz the law's biased
Skip the battles back in 86, now niggas tattle, chop crazy bricks
Cop new kicks, quick to say they rich
Fantasize and flatten the hills, for niggas in ghettos
Its crack, bullets that kill, dreams are fulfilled
Murders, ink in cold blood, holdin grudges for years
I keep two bitches, two hot biscuits, four dot sixes
The sorrow to swallow, I follow my motto
Squeeze first, since the day I slung, ready rockin a bottle
I stand and deliver like Edward Olmos, wet whatever
Respect whatever, I talk with a tech forever

Our show's at your service on behalf of Final Chapter
? I'm not a rapper, quick to slap ya
Got scheme, its not a factor, we gotta shine first
Have 'em coppin your album just for our verse
Straight like that, y'all better tell 'em
I hope they don't act like we won't smack to back of their cerebellum
Oh and did I mention? if I feel tension
Get the full arm extension, get the whole block's attention
I know you keep your life in your cash
Your cash in the stash, stash in the car, car in the lot
So when I blow up the lot ::BOOM:: your whole shit stop
Y'all rappers is backwards, make the game flip flop
I'll take you to the spot with no witnesses and no cops
Better have your Glock out and cocked, about to pop
To hustlers like Flynt, sellin cracks like Sprint
A dime a minute, now roll the dice, five in it


Aiyyo, aiyyo
I peeped your true colors while y'all niggas was blinded
I been down and spit a pound before you knew I was rhymin
You know me, illest flow, ain't no seconds for timing
My sixteens'll rip through beats, cut deeper than diamonds
Make ya niggas start to worry cuz my hood is dark and blurry
When shots flurry, niggas point guard like Marbury
Ain't no arguing, all my click'll do is get the targeting
Final Chapter split pies in two, its half bargaining
I've seen you niggas come up quick and then fall
I've seen you frontin for your broad like her pussy's the bomb
Clowns findin their stash gone but my cash is long
So I'mma let y'all pass on, cuz you ass like a thong
My click is movin out, now is you rollin along?
Til I perish I'm spittin strong, it's that shit that I'm on
Final Chapter's comin at ya, now the drama is born
Settle in this street life from the hoods to the lord

Aiyyo I'm still ghetto, that's why these niggas love me
I'm still on the run eatin so I got chubby
I spaz up in the Tunnel, stab niggas with pens
That's why til this day they don't let me in
I be in New York smokin LA weed
I hate a bitch named Pebbles like LA Reed
I dead niggas like Pac and BIG, blocks to live
These niggas can't eat like hostages
Fuck Camry's and fuck Honda Accords
I rob niggas like the Crips at the Source Awards
And everything that went down was cool with me
As long as I came back with my jewelry
We had machine guns, I think we had two or three
And two or three limos, me and my nigga Timbo
For bitches that suck nuts and spit it out the window

Every man is accountable for his own demons
Deep in the shadows of my mind i can hear the screaming

Yeah you love to hear the story again
Too bad you will only shine so glory be towards my name
See you in the future tomorrow's mouse give me a pen
If your heart stop beating i go back in time
Reverse the sin in the hour glass
When you counting my crime
I wanted by my own cerebellum
Love unconditional but i could never tell her
Remember gum fire echo in my mind bending
I find it hard to even talk about it now bredrin
You sacrificed your life and paid the price for a legend
Facts it's really real what I’m saying yea so real I’m saying
Oh Lorenzo i wish i could apologize to make it simple
But life twisted life changing simple
Now facing these lines and everything we been through
Got me pouring my heart out over this instrumentals

Is it my que that i heard it again later that evening
I know that voice but that’s nobody but uptop
I thought he was in grain sing sing don’t stop
The next morning i caught him by the window walking
A child when i heard a No like i just peaked track
I got love for this nigga so I’m going to live
I pull to the house got to show him my strength
Everyday we reminisce about mommy you know the clip too
Laughing about the day he fell and got a chip tooth
Only nigga i know respected by everybody
And he ain't even have to sell crack to buss a shotty
The ore in the nigga pure flow in your blood
And you got a reputation until you lay in the mud
You trash hoe you can’t take his place
So i had a son too tatoo on your face
He was real and believe strong like everything we breathe on
Them moma heard the voice like the jeans long
When we were in that jail together
Which we would have kept it real for ever
Oh you my brother from another mother
You know nigga i love you for ever time will tell

Take game, I got grabbed up
Asking me questions, interogating
The way the hatin, they just remind me of satan
Keep em motivating, police asking questions about this and this
I don't know shit, and hell no, I don't know 5 or 6
I'm confined to a small room
I celly off to my beeper, thought I had to sues
And the headache, was the feelings for me and my crew
To take impostas, impalas and black sues
Big boys, and LL cues
I'm thinking like deep cover
I'm in too deep, like Donnie Brasco
Who could be the asshole
I make sure the motherfucker don't last long
Roll to the castle where my niggas be, triggers be
Blowin they backs out, they felt the misery
And the decision be, spill coffee
Who's on the beats I can't be locked up
They had evidence, make the scenery all dense
But it's Ok my lawyer will approach the bench

I don't know nobody, and I ain't seen shit
Thats the way it is, you try to lock me up
Put me in cuffs, motherfucker handle your biz
Cause I don't know nobody, and I ain't seen shit
That's the way it is, you try to lock me up
Put me in cuffs, motherfucker handle your biz

Pop, they caught me off guard
I was stuck the beat shit fucked
I went down to my knees
And put out the trees
I sat down on the benches
He snuck his dog on my five senses
All I could hear was a walky talky saying ""I got em""
I'm asking the charge, yeah you know he shot em
We biscuit printed plus your first henes borrowin
I ain't heard nuff yet, next day daily news read
Murder suspect, 19, down in Queens
Day of rainment where he had slim chance to win it
Two asses from bail so they gave glances
It's Friday, had to lay for the weekend stretch
First thing, Monday morning, calling for street connects
Man I forgot the machine they callin for
Fuck a message all they need is it playin back
I'm confined a 8 by 12 flat
With bums niggas who sell crack
Flippin off the the world

He's like the shut the fuck up
We got evidence, we know the deal
They got tape confessions of your man
Whiping out your man
Key witness to the stands
I should have played yours
The moving bar to my moms get the news to bar
Same time Jake taking me out
Same line gonna try and fake me out
Sitting in the van pointing face out
Soon as I hit the plan, the course going close the plan
Take em out, take em out, before the court day out
I won't say, but by tomorrow, I'm out
Nothing to say follow snitch
Lay low, and hollow him out
And pones is wilding too
Niggas like Maze got the same time as you

Walking down a half dee, snatch me up
Little g's no pad
These niggas gonna cuff me up
On stayed in the back so he could scuff me up
Blows from the walky talky, gonna fuck me up
Asking me about shit I knew, but won't tell
Just you and Baby D, ain't nobody depending on me
Saying if I won't talk, I'll wait in the cell
They got evidence to leave me in jail
There's no time for this shit
Just sign the statement
If you snitching, you won't have to say shit
Reverse pyschology, he trying to lie to me
He try to pin me for murder
And a string of robberies
Plus you a ex-con send me to the book
Cause press on
Cash and bonds, they won't last very long
I know they frontin, they got nothing on me

I blow shots at these faggots, these niggas is herbs
My vertical switch, converted with nerve
Catch my anywhere, gun down, hand on my dick
These hoes love me, these niggas just salute the God
I boosted cars, now I just cop and spend loot at bars
I got little paper, these cats still hatin'
But now I send shots racin', shots like Gary Payton
I'm Jose, I'm half God and half Satan
I fuck with Lake, dump bodies in the lake
Ain't no tellin' what othet measurements we take
I brought my niggas out the hood yo, not just me
And now Maze live in Jers' and Mussolini
And I'm a nigga that flip shit and just hawk spit
These niggas had beef but now they wanna squash it
I'm a thug and hustler, not a pimp or a mack
It's N.O.R.E., you know, the Limp Bizkit of rap
Chorus (Noreaga)
Yo Lake, what the fuck man?
Cock the calicko, make these niggas duck man
They outta luck man
And we ain't wit' talkin', we gon' buck man
(repeat)
Verse 2: (Lake)
It's like the game is over, soldiers don't listen
Bitches ain't loyal and generals is snitchin'
My breed is becoming extinct, we all dyin'
Layin' in the Mountains or on the run hidin'
Livest niggas is comin' home gettin' jobs
It hurts my heart to see a real niggas starve
Carved a niggas face so bad in a rumble
They had me in the bing in the fall wearin' a muzzle
Bubble for my niggas in prison wearin' mittens
When you get the privelege of freedom start livin'
I spit it with integrity, still keep it thorough'n
Move heroin every town and borough I'm in
A candy store with Christian Diore
On Iceburg Valore with suede beiges on
I morn on the born of my dog thats in the essence
Express and live on, I incorporate the jail letters
My life is epic, accept it, I'm what you wanna be
Before I let 'em cuff me white sheets 'll cover me
Why? cause I'm a serious nigga with a serious mind
So if I get locked up I'll be serious time
Chorus
Hey yo 'pone, what the fuck man
Grab the Calicko, make these niggas duck man
They outta luck man
And we ain't wit' talkin', we gon' buck man
(repeat)
Verse 3: (Capone)
Peep the gangsta physiche, slim, fire with a fetish
Move with a deathwish, bullets turn brolic niggas anorexic
Life's hectic, push weight and records
Still spazzin', take your necklace, I stay connected
Spit any niggas block on lean
Tinted glass, three inches cracked down, Mac in between
Cut school, got paid slingin' crack to the dean
Seen a heemy head blow turn back to a fiend
Capone, Luciano, and Mega, Noreaga
Here to drop anonymous tips, bitches flip for the right paper
It's pain, time, and glory, the essence of the thoroughest nigga, I rest
My faith in the corner
Watch me get up on ya
(Phone rings)
(Mega) yo
(Lake) yo Mega it's Lake
(Mega) whassup?
(Lake) yo, 'pone 'bout to holla at you
(Mega) about what?
(Lake) I can't get into it over the phonehe 'bout to come at you right
Now
(Mega) aight
Chorus (Capone)
Ayyo Mega what the fuck man
Grab the calicko, make these niggas duck man
They outta luck man
And we ain't wit' talkin', we gon' buck man
(repeat)
Verse 4: (Mega)
My life is blood money and big guns
I'm the nigga your connect get hit from
Hello, and I rep the ghetto, how real is that?
Nigga you too cocky
I'm like 2Pac, who could stop me?
I got a message from Papi
Who the body in the trunk? I wanna know like Joe
My flow ill like 'pone's Tahoe
Fuck the fake shit
Son, look at us, we all did state bids
I'm in it to win but I lost my patience
Niggas def, dumb, and blind when I floss my bracelet
In Queensbridge, in the scene with Benzes and Beamers
Niggas who hate cops and love squeezin'
Whats the meanin'? all hail the thug allegiance
Tryin' to get right cause I don't want my unborn seeds slingin'
The Mantana shit, banana clips
Bringin' to niggas if my Man is hit",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-we-gon-buck-lyrics
The Oath,The War Report 2: Report the War,2010.0,"One thing you have to realize
If you opened them up, there would be a stamp under their shirt that
Says 'Made in America""
Ok, not no place else
They weren't made in Taiwan or you know, Indonesia
They were made in America

The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one
""I've sworn an oath""

Late night fistfights, with bare knuckles
Nowadays, niggas probably wouldn't dare scuffle
It's big guns aimed at your nozzle, big Roscoe
Donnie Brasco wish death to they vato
Cigarette smoking, on the crater for the corner store
Same place as the ambulance and corridor
Growing up seeing dead bodies in the lobby
I used to hate the smell of it, then I got used to it
Just for the hell of it, young man, intelligent
I always know that the police was the enemy
And 
every dead president I make will be a friend of me
Bitches ain't shit, cuz most of them is evil
And most of them hoes start more wars than we do
Circle, cycle, three sixty trifling
When a baby is born somebody else life end
From the birth canal to the hearse, we enlighten
[Interlude: Capone +

The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one
""I've sworn an oath""

Ayo, dead bodies found in the building, OD'ing on heroine
Early morning, needing they medicine
Elephant arms, used to control the bombs
Islam, ay Shallah, niggas bulletproof kufis
Just to live out another script in this life's movie
The corner's snatch you, murder if you have to
Dead niggas can't talk, they haunt like a castle
I wasn't the type that go out tagging
I spray your face like a PD, I was chopping and bagging
Capone-N-Noreaga, that's a blood oath, prick fingers
Like Albert Anastasia, the wildest nature
My calibrators on a higher level, I riot with the devil
Walk righteous, canaries in them bezel
Death before dishonor, money over bitches I'm my brother's keeper
I throw the world in the sleeper, I'm so eager to blast
Bilingual, I be speaking in cash

The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it
And when we grow, we grow as one
""I've sworn an oath""

Shallah, a letter to the loyal, we dedicated, most of us elevated
Or fell into a pine box that's ultra suaded
Cast iron metal, new Beretta's, blue leathers
Snake bites, Timberlands, few gelettas
Reward me a God, I'm a multiple crop, multiple stocks
They violate us they get multiple shots
You might get picked off, or toast two with Heinekens
We under the building, designer gems on with uzi's, hoodie coogi's
All I know is prosper, lobster fish, this is a mobster dish
Fly around in Masi's, sipping sakes
Twenty one iron down allegiance, the days of repentance
We hate bosses, we just know the consequences
Used to sniff, pull out then squeeze, now I roll with a gift
My only rift is why we coaching them thieves
We just Allah babies, save us from the block, and keep our family one
And pray five times a day, saves alot

The family is the family
This oath is this oath
And I will die before I break it

Russian Roulette, nigga—pull it!
Shots tear smell us when you move like you stupid
Pop 'berg, water boil bubble when I cook it
Look it, the criminal mind niggas that's crooked
Speak third person, nigga, build with my liaison
We move quiet, nigga, more secretive than a Mason
Based on, the coppers handle niggas when they bust 'em
I'm honoring an oath, while we live by the old customs
Politic with foreign niggas, regular, we fly the jets
Speaking in code, when they struggle, unravel the dialect
Every kind of foreign currency is what we try to get it
Crap table gamble, nigga, hunt your million dollar bet
Better know I must collect, hope you got it for me
And an oath is something I learned is alluded as a shorty, now
I hope you niggas don't mistake it
Will defend it and later in a grave before we break it",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-the-oath-lyrics

Hold the tomatoes Bee, extra mayonase yall niggas be cheap on the mayonase
And I'mma take some chips and this muthafucking Sunkist I'll pay you later]
Yeaa!! See I don't see eye to eye with niggas
I kill em fast I ain't gotta say goodbye to niggas
Noreaga the office is a bodega
Ask pancho hit em with the hancho
All I really need is baking soda and the blanco
Bullet proof glass selling loosies on the late night
Got big work kind to cut it with a snake knife
The homie paco work on the morning shift
That's my man uncle put in work for a morning sniff
Yea! we done switch the whole operation
Humptu allah prey we lost to observation
They know I'm the shit but I had constipation
Right hand damaged again and I ain't lefty
Put the razor right by his chin right where his neck be
My new York niggas wolverine chlorine
Wild niggas from fort greene roll like a ball team

Bodega dreams bodega nightmares
This my hood I grew up and had fights here
And you protect it so when you get arrest it
They ask you to speak without a lawyer you neglect it

Ahaaaa!.Yo Steal it if you can't afford it
Shoot it out or either sort it
The war still gotta get reported
Coke will get snorted niggas will get slaughter
Spots get raided shut down and boughted
I really owe papi half of my stash
For letting me set shop up in the back by the trash
This here is the get back I can just kick back
Cop and go thou move traffic by the chip rack

""Donnie"" Na is Foxy and Mega Street Fighter or Sega
Corner store vanilla dutchy the bodega
Use to have the hammer that shoot crooked
Fell asleep drunk one night moms came home and she took it
Look it boards head turkey fiends coming thru with bootleg burkies
Tell my lil workers to chirp em
Donnie white hoody white 4 door Porsche ku klux looking
Here my source in Brooklyn

Use to move C and D in the bodega
12 gauge pump nine mill and the 0 raza
Weapon by the video game never one by the cold cuts
Niggas get stretched over here for acting so tough
This our hood consider it a wolf den
Tryna run up in and fucking with a wolf then
Get a bullet in your tooth then
CNN and Lox hood niggas salute them


Aiyyo Mo from the candy store use to sell a nigga bullets
And he from Pakistan hit em with a half a gram
He get you anything no matter the gun size
Throw it in the bag with the chips and the loosies
Papi on the ave got the connect on the bootsies
A stroll outta 40th me and my nigga snoopy
Yea what up papi dimelo un minuto lets polly thou
Walk me to the basement I was startle by the rody bark
Flash the 8 on me musta thought I was from collie park
Na pa I need something that fit on my nike boot
He laughed at me in Spanish and said this will bite troops
Grab the lil 25 next to the gold riffle
This is etiquette I'm on my berretta shit gave em the bread and split
I heard that 24 got the re-up
Thats the all night store the hood ikea
You can get it all from the baggies to the leaks

Brothers,The Reunion,2000.0,"Lets get this shit perculating son u know
Thugged Out entertainment coming at your motherfucking neighborhood
Know what I'm saying, like a theater near you
Troy Outlaw, Goldfingaz
Capone-N-Noreaga 2000 CNN you know how we doing
Thugged out entertainment taking over the motherfucking world
For the new millenium, know what I'm saying?
Ya niggas can't fuck with this
Ya niggas can't stop this, ya niggas can't touch this
Ya niggas had better ??

Me and my dunn's thoughts divide like earth and the rain
I'm severed like Kevin Spacey and depth to the game
We the same in every aspect except for the chain
Connect 41-18 the bridge bang
I give the kidney, just so the lord will forgive me
And bring back mami and mambo, mano a mano
We poly over Chardonnay bottles
Opposite like Felix and Oscar
Sign to the street like Carlos
We sway deeper than the shit through the speaker
I smoke grade A reefer
Up north sport away for the cesaer
Used to smuggle through the mess hall
Blow a stiff circle in the yard
Be home now, stuck in our zone now
Can't take it from us, we run wit the corner
Nigga we stay dirty, you know, straight slum performers
A judge, then I'll ride for you
Assist a slug then I'll die for you
I'm loyal, what nigga

 I bust a cap for my brother till death do us part
And for all my brothers that keep up, I'll show you love from the heart
 You and I we can die together, yo shit don't change
We'll always be thugs forever
 From the start playa haters tried to disconnect us
We too tight for that, we getting more cheddar
 But me and you we can die together
But me and you we can die together

Yo from harlon valley to greenhaven
We had these niggas thats Wes Craven
Never good never behavin'
Victor Santiago, and ?Kaya M Holly?
You know how we do
Catch a body then we go party
We used to be in billyway, church and jail
Me and capone smoke weed till I burnt my nail
I used to cut niggas faces
Smoke weed out of bible papers
The Knicks and the Lakers
See me with a Northface, facing the north
Drinking Schmirnoff and taking niggas face right off
N.O.R., and shit ain't really change that much
Except I smoke a Philly can't fuck wit her guts
I eat aunties food, the best in new york
Boneless chicken, and she don't cook no pork
I got some Chardonnay, nigga go and pop the cork
Me and Capone made up, everytime we fought


From out the dark into the lights on the streets
Slugs pop when slugs meet
Its death from the birth of the streets
Yo outlaw, hit me 1-6-0-9
Cock back and bust nines, this bitch nigga plotting on mom
My fam too, cuz god niggas body your crew
Bitches will never come between the life of two
And ain't nothin gonna change but my age
My attitude is deep, I get it from my peoples in graves

Yo me and you go togetha like Tango and Cash
Like Capone-N-Noreaga like the weed and hash
We stick together like coke, like we still sell drugs
Bad seeds from the ghetto but we still get love
We just trying to make it, while other niggas fake it
We blow your cool like we chill now its time to take it
Like you never had it, you don't deserve it
Fake niggas getting jealous
But these hoes be giving cervix


Straight like that, official thug niggas
Real niggas, know what I'm saying?
Real niggas selling that crack
Busting their cap, know what I'm saying?
Real niggas don't cry
Niggas do time know what I'm saying?
You know how we do, stick to the motherfucking ghetto
Fuck you, fuck your crew, fuck your girl too
Know how we do, CNN once again, you know

Fuck all ya muthafuckers out there, don't want nothin
Thugged Out in this shit forever, QBC nigga

You Can’t Kill Me,The Reunion,2000.0,"We put too much work in
Seen too many cold days, too many nights servin
It's been tried, we will survive
CNN rise, keep street ties
We got a hundred niggas strong
A hundred niggas armed to kill you right or wrong
You can't murder what's dead
We walk the pavement with, one in the head

Now what I stands for I rise for, my man's who I die for
Blows frontline in the war, despise law
I'm built to be guilty, filthy, dirty, rich
Niggas wanna kill me 'fore I'm thirty-six
Stop my lifeline, I'm tryin to hundred thousand dollar car and ice mine
Predicate felon, lifetime
Consecutive cases, no respect for racists, haters hate this
Hope to trade places, and piss where my grave is
I lay this down, I blaze this pound I'ma say this now
Fuck around and I'ma chastise
You ain't that wise, I'm out to capitalize
My cap size is nine milli, leave you slumpin back in your ride
My hood sit on bloody acres, parallel to my maker
I squeeze vertical a fiend I'm servin you
What dirt'll do to virginal niggas, is get 'em kilt
Filled with hot lead, but not by the feds, who wanna see me dead?

You can't killlll, me
We put too much work in
Seen too many cold days, too many nights hurtin
You can't killlll, me

CNN rise, keep street ties
You can't killlll, me

A hundred niggas armed to kill you right or wrong
You can't killlll, me
You can't murder what's dead
We walk the pavement with, one in the head

I can't believe what I saw, through the eyes of the corner
I had warrants on each name, aliases in each state
I got caught, what the hell did I thought?
Turkey bacon or turkey ham, it's pork
It's the same thing, you should look how I walk
The gun make me lean to the left, I saw it and repped
Look for the moment to step, Mo-e' I'm wet
The judge know I caught a nigga and I beat him to death
But it's okay, I go jet ski in the Bay
Away from New York, and go lay up in L.A
I know intelligent niggas that move dough
Leave out of the hood, and lose all of they shit
Well I don't lose nuttin, I learned how to mix with other cultures
Other vultures, niggas know I leave my path
Kneeds the math, it's good like the Haitian hash
It's amazin, you know my nigga Maze won't crash, it go


As long as blood in my vein flows niggas gon' hate
Wish on my death date, give my description, to the plain clothes
Rely on my fate, remain cold
Like lost souls to the crossroads, guns I been bought those
I'm a legend, only if Lord knows
You can't kill me and place me in Potter's Field
Y'all niggas not as real
I predict that I'ma die squeezin, thug it through the five seasons
I place my trust in the heat, my higher bein
You cannot kill me, or have me leanin slumped on a project gate
With one in my stomach, barely breathin
My moms grievin, my wife cryin, my kid's a bastard
I bust iron, fuck livin or dyin
Fools who work out get tight caskets
Niggas who merk out when I spray crash kid

Thinkin it's they turn they know I'm rich

Ay yo she get what she get don't ask for shit
And I told y'all niggas that I bust to the sceddene
Y'all niggas is wack like the cops solid cuisine
Fuck that yo, all them niggas is straight wack
Blow holes through they chest slugs go through they back
And what got me mad is that I really wanna dump off
I say M.U. see if y'all wanna dump off
I was a little kid when I went up north

On a run from the laws wit a gat in they claws
Wit a pack in they draws
I ain't even threw the cracks in they paws
Bang Bang we love to settle the score
Shift from me in the fourth these guys is ready for war
I say the kingdom of the fame once more we reclaim
Either a cop, slug or twenty thou threw on a chain
Niggas simplistic I been flipped it pumped through blizzards
Clutched the gun on my hip, survival of the fittest
I runt this shit like business
C.E.O. crack merchants tell me when it's dark like guiness
Fly son'll do I run a few
Piss on the world we number one, you shitty niggas still number two
Gunnin you down bitch you frontin you
Like ""Oh shit"" tried to run, I put one in her too


Ay yo

Tried to flip the game like an eight ball
You speedin

Haters they ain't lovin you
I'm trying to live comfortable
Fuck it like Cliff Huckstable
Gettin cash what a thug'll do
Fuck hoes and never call once so they could never call me a bugaboo
I reign from the sky to the concrete under you

I'm down where the crips play criddaps
And bloods scream bliddap
CNN fall back let us get that
We get your kids kidnapped
If its feed back be like that man from cuba beggin for your seed back
And if you don't see me wit CNN or F.C

Real niggas that convince me, we true friends
From the streets to penitentiary, they my mans
For you I let my clips empty, you understand?

Half gal' of Henny liquor fuck up my liver
I could do without it, I smoke sour
And yeah I'm God body, I'm in tune with the objects
Dead pictures under the benches in all projects
And I don't care what the mayor say
It's a recession, they putting bricks on layaway
And sometimes I wan' stay away
And change my jumpshot back to a fadeaway
But everything okay today
Tomorrow ain't promised though, and you should know it's not
Hit the church, hit the mosque, go pray and meet Salam
I ain't tryna kick knowledge and get all religious
Spit razors out my mouth, give your face stitches
Coupes with the deep dishes, leather seat posture
No love for the coppers, no love for the rockers
I'm authentic, organic, I recognise imposters


Yo, if my niggas got drama, I'll murder for them
I get caught, I say ""Your Honor, I murdered that man""
God forbid, my niggas die, then I'll murder for them
For every one of mine you take I'm killing ten of your men
My niggas struggling, share the same pain as me
Stay thugging cause they share the same pain as me
On the corner slinging dope, serving fiends like me
Watching for police, dodging the same thing as me
If my niggas get caught, they know I'll be there
Look behind your shoulder in trial, I'll be there
Help you post bail when you sentenced, I'll be there
I'll hold fort till you come back, I solemnly swear
Fuck models when you come out, pop bottles when you come out
At the gate pick you up, you drive the Hum' out
License plate, registration, suitcases full of big faces
If I ain't got it, then we bout to take it

All my niggas rolling with me to the end
Real niggas that convince me, we true friends
From the streets to penitentiary, they my mans
For you I let my clips empty, you understand?

True friends nigga, CNN, God's Son
Fo'-fo' silencers, we duct tape a witness up
Everybody dying just to beat a murder trial
Favor for a favor, that's how I'm on it
You wet mine, I wet yours, no money exchanged, that's consignment on it
I send a wreath to foes with condolences
Emotionless when I'm squeezing, easy to focus kid
A loyal nigga like Kane and Purnell
My gangsta is too heavy, try to weigh it on a scale
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
For my niggas, ain't no telling who I'll give it to
We the same blood type? I'll give my liver too
Revenge is a promise, that shit is biblical
I got five, you got two and a half though
We split everything down the middle like ash yo
You don't fuck with none of my niggas then don't speak to me
Frequently I like to +Buckshots+ like Evil Dee",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-with-me-lyrics

I give you a thousand grams

He throw blow in lands, hit good pussy up, kush me up
My dough is advanced and rover with the lambskin coat on
Lighting reefer, my mans and them
We got plans, man, but first show me where the grams went
Ten fold scheme in the doorway, we all the way in now
What they rolling for? We blowing them bowling balls
Rifle with the knife on it, lifers jump right up on it
Maseratis double piping, wrist lightning
I rhyme for the flight men, the drug boys, thug noise
They want, they come get it from me, it's like done
I'm just a scholar with some street drug news, plug dudes
No kidnappings, we mug dudes, I love jewels
Might take your man shit, up in the jam and shit
Listenin' to Eric B. & Rakim, plannin' shit
I'm all for the vandal shit, good nights
Bet I got a good gun with long bullets and a Taruga light
Come to the palace, chalices, hood pussy from Dallas
All of this is childish, I allowed this
Rap saved the babies, all these young niggas with these 3-80's
Fronting like they robbed down Macy's
Stop it, we them cockpit boys, we got shit
Plus pop shit, grab your bird twatty; obnoxious
Flashin' knots and shit, yachts that smell like piss
It's all good, we only fucking in her mouth, partner
The lock men, I rock, was robbing, met her out in Africa
Yeah, yeah, bought her my Glock, let me hold that man...

We the Dutch Masters—the blunts with the gun-flashers
Love maxing, watch niggas' last moves
Keep it cool, get those ones, play the building
Get your run game on, and stay stashin'

Ayo, octopus-hands, flashbacks of the gold Rollie
Shootouts in the liquor store, my man on parole owe me
Old man freedom still preaching on the block
Still talking, you can't sling jumbs and hold a walkman
Fishcale dumped inside the quarter water juices
Staircase madness, the hammer stash gooses
Went to time flow, yo I heard they let Shyne go
Big whip spaces, betting at the horse races
Old school wit it, banging Julio Iglesias
Suaded leather seats, feet reclined, line back of moves
Homey with the chipped tooth from Faragent, he arrogant
Did a bid with him, gave him razors in the church hall
Then he turn Muslim, Jihad to hurt ya'll
Hooligan goon shit, never onto FUBU
Never on computers, niggas never heard of Google
Mink slippers lounging with the cashmere headband
Still spending Euro's, Germany, Dresden
Dubai high, drinking all the French water
Champagne-yah, my campaign a, macarena
Aim a flamer, his accent was Dana Daner
I mean Dana Dane, distribution crazy 'caine
Elvis sideburns, his appearance always crazy lame
Move big weight though—Winnebago
Remind me of Dego, and Jose Canseco
The man in San Diego, that's where he lay low
His soldiers do what he say so, all day though
Yeah, little nigga you gotta respect protocol
That's where you come from homeyboy

Ayo, cigar-niggas—Phillies my favorite
Beat the affidavit, that good weed—you save it
Run through the alleyways, ever since the valley days

Run through the alleyways, ever since the valley days
We been on that New York shit, but smoking Cali-haze

Ayo, five grams crushed in a bill fold—he snorted it
Coke professor, test it before he ordered it
Lamping on a La-Z-Boy, real McCoy, flick the ashes
Champagne bitches is butt naked, filling glasses
Whips with the mean stashes, ox spitting gun clappers
Onasis money, she fly with the package
Easy Wider rider nigga, I'm a bamboo vandal
Ran through cities, looking for white paper, that rice papers
That bullshit, the back of the Bibles, the light saver
I blow joints to the head, Al Queda raider
Black bandanna, old hammer, phone scrambler
Niggas wearing wires cuz shit bad, lit on fire
Old school marvels, pardon the middle, waves bust to the side
Still rocking diddy bop like '85
Them pinky rings, diamond crust Diors is diamonds dusted, trust it
My niggas rob to rob niggas, so fuck it
Hip hop awards, I was low in them bucket, blowing kisses at Toya Luckett
Before that I was backstage puffing

For my bamboo niggas—lay low, playing the benches, relentless
Fresh home from a sentence
You know the rules—get your money and move, blast tools

Turn around to shshshsh, to shoot faggots
I been a star since Pat Benetar
CNN, Lox the type of shit that have you fleein' a rock
I been put the key in a lock
Who got a song, hot a Capone
And Nore copped the Benz, first day home
I been beatin' niggas up, been spittin' on hoes
Thinkin' they too good for hood niggas
Been in my zone
Been the champ since Larry Holmes, Spinks had teeth
And in a forbuilding
Been had 'em reppin' the street
Caught 'em wide over Y.O, first felony
Solo Eightball and MJG
What is you tellin' me

Yo, yo

Mad fuckin' guns, ha
I had them hundreds when you had them little ones, ha

But 'ell die for money

And if the L.O.X. get rich
We goin' divide the money
Where we from we stay live
And survivin' hungry

Don't pass me a blunt
But you can pass me a gun

And you can have that pretty bitch
Right after I cum

And you can front and keep your watch
We goin' puncture a lung

L.O.X. style

Cocksucker

Dump and we run

All our dogs up in the slums

Humpin' they chums

Holdin' they pits

Lightin' blunts
Loadin' they shit

And niggas can't understand
That we married the street
And when we felt like we were cheatin'
We ain't carryin' our heat

And we don't like holdin' nothing
But we carry a beef
Hopin' ya family stay strong

Then they can carry the grief
You break bread with a thief

And then you scarry to sleep

And we ain't tryin' to bury you

We tryin' to bury a jeep

Hahahahahaha, yo, yo
My niggas get locked up, and when they come home
It's mink coats and Cristal, just ask Capone
We play the game like mobsters, Oliver Stone flicks
Based on a true story, it's Nore
And all of my niggas buck for me, the projects love me
It feel good to have love in the hood
And I ain't got to buy weed, cause my credit is good
Machine gun lyrics, CN lift spirits
Smoke more weed than dreads, hip-hop heads
Gotta, listen to this before they piss in they beds
My mission instead, leave these niggas missin and dead
And leave em dumped in a river, buttnaked and red
N.O., erase niggas no pro-blemo
Keep a razor in my mouth - spit it out
And I never had to boof nothing or shit it out
And I still got it but I had to Thug It Out
Chorus: CNN (repeat 2X)
Yo, it's like my mission just to live this way
I had to sell things, but I wanted to live each day
Real people do real things
So why is real people still doin fake things?  HUHHH?
	Peace God
	Whattup nigga?
	I'm glad you home
So we could, take over the world, it's ours to own
	Stars to bone from the ghetto, to cars and homes
	Laced out, Jesus piece, ice the face out
	My Niggas On The Run they place out
Flee fiends with the cake mouth
Automatic guns, bullets spray out
	Lay out, what?  Gimme the cash and the coke
Sometimes I got money, and I still feel broke
And sometimes I got reefer and I don't even smoke
	I don't sleep, ninety-five percent of the time I'm woke
The other 5 is when a nigga high, hear the thugs cry
	And me, I'm Thugged Out, I'll just sleep on the floor
With the rats and the roaches, keepin it raw
	My heat is the four, while y'all niggas lean on the law
	Peter pay Paul, an outlaw, he stuck up the mall
	I watch for the cops, still a Thug after the deal
CNN gotta thug it for real
Chorus

Thuggology's the major, paper
Capone-N-Noreaga teach ya, villainize your whole nature
The law was built around capers since the years of the West
And are you real or fake?  How many thugs hear the question
Twenty grand on the lawyer, extra hundred for bail
Next to death's kiko, is goin to jail
Unassissted, I shivered and frail
My ice similar to hail yo, for the 85 that's in braille
I keep Chanel on my hoes, crazy blowin the scale
Mad chickens for my thugs locked, low on the mail
Yo it's 'Pone or it's Fonz, either pretty or thug
Whichever way it's called, in every city a slug
If I was dyin would a true fan give me they blood
And would my man take the stand, lie in front of the judge?

You say you lookin for a lover Boo, someone you can talk to
I walk these streets, tryin hard not to hawk you
Laugh when they stalk you, playin my cards
Weighin the odds, I see your face like a mirage
Your hair tied in a bun, with a chopstick through it
Your frames make you look erotic, exotic twist
Don't know I'm a thug, but I'm sentimental
Cried when Cochese died; a villain need a girlfriend too
Love it when they play shy - and if I ever fall in love
See this babyface?  Swear I never tell a lie
Gossip got you hatin me so much right now
Like Kelis, ready to call police, give 'em all the heat
You know I'm on parole, so you chose not to beep for a week
Couldn't see your man goin up creek
Fuck the B.I.'s, the letters, and the short-eye pictures
I'ma ride for my bitches, if they ride for my niggas


I see you workin hard, the wrong man got you cursin God
Earth in the physical flesh, a certified star
You make your own, I know you tired of spendin days alone
All cried out, I'm wonderin if I can take you home
We can lay up, breakfast when you wake up
A covergirl, lovin your world, fly no make-up
Ain't nuttin change, I stay sunk in the Range
I get brain, switch lanes when I'm pluckin a dame
Hit your job on your lunch break, the spots they can take
Make a date later this week, so we can celebrate
Knew my hustle, you never did try to knock it
The first true thug in your life, I got you in the pocket
Wasn't with the sneakin thing, the hill showed your appeal
You keep it real with the feminine feel
I still love the stretch socks and your Reeboks
I love my mami's, konichi-wa, and your nani-nani


How does it feel for you to be in my world
Even my girl shoppin sprees Monopoly cheese, coppin you pearls
Sautee or foreplay, all day
From the bedroom, to the hallway, I'm all in her toes
Open my nose, love it when you go downtown
Hold a freak too, I'd love to see you, in somethin see-through
Beep daddy, I come and eat you
Speedin in a Caddy buck on the (?), room three-two
The spot next to (?) low, nobody gotta know

Principals to the street shit so shawty you suspended
Don't make me reach inside these stretchers
Shoot these niggers off the benches
My architect is armagen specialize in holding weapons
But your intentions really be trying to saying you washed up
I’m armied up what the fuck you little niggers all stuck

And they ain't scrambling street dice gambling
Dope spot coke spot no lo trying to dodge swat
Most niggers snitch till they get shot
Eh yow blood covers humanism this is to expand the plan
Afghanistan pack of wolves you all a pack of lambs
Yow the aftermath is damn nigga hit you for a half a grand
Should have asked you man like what up dazzled in


You see they use and they sell cocaine i don't understand it
She ain't bring home too much still
And got remanded you gotta watch who you talk to
These young niggers never listen
They fuck around and put us in a bad position
It's a paint brush around my life is a living canvas
Even if his life is behind the bars is better than the average
A savage man street life we make the marriage the status
Rocking king turn isis four carrots


All the drug dealers inquiring interested in retiring
Four one K no that one came with it
He tried and he done did it then strippers we done hit it
Cause we done driven those houses got pools in them
Yow geese give a nigga somewhere to breathe

I got a chinese bitch singing a hook
See chinese bitch willing to cook
I took her out for some soki and some sushi
She made it clear that she wasn’t a groupie
Yeah, slime, let me tell you about my little movie
Yea i met a bad one in the city her name was sooki
Her best friend is haitian and she knew voodoo
I asked in the room if they eat poodle
She a bad chinese bitch i meant and that and then some
Then on canal street hearing the pin bun
Hopping out the 325 and the rims done
Thing we are going just like the little kim one


I asked if she ate chi chi dong sing
Her chop stick is paint brush hard decko
We communicate through sign language
But we both smoke money that’s the same language
We were in the same thing monies was a plus
Her pops was a boss out in beijing
She move to america to go to school
But the videos made her fall in love with the thugs
And the loaders too
She said she came from loyalty
Back in Asia the bitch came from royalty
And she would jump off the roof for me
Run rings with the twins got loose for me


Uh she had family in Cowiyi
So i took her to Huawei
We went surfing at Malibu
I smoked and cook straight out of the colli too
You were tricking i just hit her with game right
Now that my man finish the made me hit it the same night
And took a nigga shopping after all the spending
She gave me dome in the whip what a happy ending",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-chinese-girl-lyrics

Murder land triflers in the hood with killa genes
Car hard jumpers and seeds is gold robers and them cheebas
Fresh off the block, note the leeches

Aiyo, machine gun rap, Maybach floor mats
Panel door suicidal, you see my rivals
Keep the sour puss face, I keep the kush case
Phillies unravel, Earth smoke spending with me
Afghanistan headband, that straight sticky
Empty pillow cases with the soda and the soap in them
With my Indian niggas that only sling opium
It's Shallah, my Chinese dudes, take they Shahada
In sweatshops, cutting them things from Guatemala
My rosary beads is blessed, came from the mountains
Used to sell dust juice, water like a fountain
I meditate in a room full of rich rugs
Stretch coke like yoga, deep like Yoda
My chronic is green they call it Shrek like ogre
Militainment, Icewater, water that freezes
Them hand to hand on the block with them pieces


Check this military regime, mafia, guns from Czechoslovakia
We eating bread getting stockier
Army apparel, draped in the Vatican, you rocking that last year
The bulletproof vessels is cashmere
Burning in a hostler, or toast ya
The east coast go Cosa Nostra, heart cold as Nova Scotia
Ramble like Che Guevara, I ran the Reagan era
Word to mama, now I smoke Obama in a grey Carrera
That's presidential kush, blowing outta bongs that fiber glass
Seventeen thirty eight Remy
The semi hold bullets that size of a little penny
Block stars, not a rock star rocking my jeans skinny

When I was raised up i never been shot or blazed up
And all I had to do is rob the liquor store
When I ride a sling low out of section four
Met this man use to help us with pyrats
And all we use to do was catch direx
I use to know a fee name transam
You know transam white girl was crazy right
Say her on day on the ten speed
Fuck you both bitch you supposed to been leaved
And then after that we had the orange tops
Stop running the cook me had a normas rocks
Best product in the hood
The T Bone got killed and that wasn't good
Though kim said fuck i could but we ain't like that
Shout out canada say night and fight back
Me and leasy own the stage
Everybody moved away more everyday
They robbed c guy got locked up
Yea every week a new letter popped up

That my brother so i wrote back
Bloody money that's what I’m on that's when i wrote that
Now I’m drinking grape juice cherry on the wall blue mall
All dugall yea many walls still we got many cars
Eating as sense of wah they say that I’m a star
That's right that who i are they looking at my support
They only shine them Rs tipped top to ya’ll
Understand i had the green one ninety
I was not as not cultures walking with my gun
And i ain’t even trying to hide it truston
Watching from the D’s on the roof top
They blizz 78 cracks these are straight facts
Around the time when skins have the black crook
And every night A stack
B stake jump from the window on the fifth floor
Mohill burning from the hill store
Everyday is a movie another nigga bucking
With a handful of niggers in the paper touching
I had a makeshift trip use to whip it
And Johnny was the first one who thought me to flip it
Cause of raw tongue Mo shot himself in the leg
With the pound i hook the shots started to hustle down
And b more put it down and it was after the black beat
Trust be them vernon wars RIP black boxes who draw

Yo, yo, yo, yo
I told them cats, niggas better cop some mac's
Now they stuck with them handguns
I thug it out with T.B., and Johnny Handsome
I hand none niggas no credit, you see I'm iller than most
I'm kinda illy with the hands, but I'm iller with toast
My guns go pow, so how you like me now?
Been in your hood, niggas ain't that gangsta
Yeah y'all overrated, so we gonna do it or not?
Or we can go to Iraq on M.U. block
I have my pitbulls tear you up
I have my lil' homies in the hood, come and just, scare you up
You don't - be in the hood, you a weak-ass clown
And when you come through, you have your niggas holdin you down
And when - I hold heat I just hold it for delf
Why ask a - nigga to shoot when I'ma buck myself?
I keep my gun by my dick so I can touch myself

It go guns in the air, guns in the air
Us Thugged Out niggas keep our guns in the air
Guns in the air, guns in the air
Us M.U. niggas keep our guns in the air, what?
 Bout to lock the whole shit down, so holla at the dog
 Bout to lock the whole shit down, so holla at the dog
Aiyyo guns in the air, guns in the air
Us grimy-ass niggas keep our guns in the air, what?

Yo, I keep chapped lips, I smoke Persian blunts
I used to shop in Albee Square..
But now I shop in Queens, I tell my niggas I'll be here
On M.U. block yo cause I don't care
With my nigga Mike  blow 'dro through the sunroof
Jeckyll'n'Hyde and purple haze
And I still be in Brooklyn, and party with Maze
I got a ghetto pass, yo and still I let the metal blast
Click click click, niggas is assed
We Thugged Out, them niggas that'll steal your stash
If you a bitch, yo we niggas that'll slap your ass
Whattup cliqua?  We can be lah, M-A
And stab these niggas up, no problem-a
And leave 'em leaked out, stab him in his ass have a cheek out
Have 'em trapped in the room, can't sneak out
With a sign on the door, that say keep out
 w/ minor variations

Yo.. I made a song about ""Hed"" and now bitches love me
They knowin they can give me head but they can't fuck me
I ran trains for Nino, even my old C.O
I even ran trains with my A&R Gino
Sometimes, I drink Smirnoff without no juice
And I'ma ride for my niggas, Baby D and Dukes
Thugged Out and M.U., we just tripled our troops
We added more niggas, and gave 'em gats and boots
And for the niggas that bend down get minks and goose
See me, I'm not greedy, not at all
Hit me at the office, yo 2-1-2, 5-6-3, 8-4-8-4
So why y'all niggas gon' wait for, runnin out of state for?
Money faulty, why you wanna cop an eight for?
Been through, too much drama and too much war
Hurryin, for so long, now it's time to score, it go

Go to the store for me
Get me some white shoe strings
I’ma clean your teeth with them shits (Hahahahaha!)

Fuck is on yo’ mind, nigga?

Rectangle rhyme, circle out the squares
I was playing beer-pong
Circle out the beers
Niggas drinkin’ bitch drinks
They should have brassieres
Still swing with machete
That's long as Paul Pierce
Let’s talk about it, Southside, cracks by the sewer
Hustle with my uncle, 107 got bruised (that was Queens!)
New Mazarati, fox before a shooter
I ran with E-Money Bags, and rest in peace Judah
They say the good die young...
I must be old as fuck (why not!)
Virgin stash, workin’ that pussy and they open up
Hand to hand fights, it was up in the air
Niggas bigger than me, but the gun made it fair
Allah U Akbar, Inshallah you gonna lose
Degrees and lessons, we need it, we gon' prove
 your apparatus
Need new mathematics
Or I’ma grab the automatics
So many gang-related in my city I don’t recognize it
Where the gods at? (We right here!) We supposed to civilize it!
Bring it back to the universe of beatdowns and rebounds
Concrete street sound
Shootin’ by C-town
Nowadays these new dudes is tampons
The type to hustle right in front they man’s moms (aw man!)
Where’s the respect? Where’s the morals? (It’s gone!)
So I’ma send shots in plurals!

Kiam, Percy and Victor
Armored up the schnitzer
Quick to crack your head like glass at a bar mitzvah
Astaughallah, mister
Niggas is eatin’ swine, trying to quote the god’s scripture
(What am I?) Sharp shooter like Kenny Ito
While you 25-gram-ass niggas is talkin’ kilo (kilo?)
Dump you in the river, see if you find Nemo
The pub was the shit ’til Cyrus done shot Chico
The revolution got to be televised in high definition
Master chef in the kitchen (whip it!)
Bring it on back, ain’t nothin’ less than addition
Rub me the wrong way, you feel the spark for the friction
While these niggas was in the playpen
I was in the state pen
Sippin’ hooch, the proof called
Called for an 8-10
But my lawyer was *so good*
I came home in 3 to the latest Benz
That was 99, all being born-to-born
I ain’t gotta say that it’s on
These are chess moves, a king never play with a pawn
Right before the sunshine, make way for the storm

There eating rice and gravy
Use to be at home crib hoping for our own cell

With cracks in it skelly got it with a water top with the wax in it
Watching only got controlled the cause
Gone from my old dodge to a BM
I saw the door to  success i just got to put the key in
Never wanted to be a rapper
Was on the turntables cause i DJed nice black poet
That's why i got the nickname DJ slice
When rich died had to start a rally
I hit the police and did 3 in harlem valley
That’s when life changed quite strange
And then i came home and started rolling with a nigga from

Its like its in 3D
Look ma your shooters made it to TV

Eighth on a triple beam, digital

Sold it to dope fiends, nodded out, rock bottom
Got into transport and sent things to Greyhound
With a old get high lady, she stayed down
She 80+ hanging around the playground

Shorty how it be when I'ma greet ya

Send a bullet through the logo in your Starter cap

Cheese taught me to squeeze first, and shoot back

East coast streets'll fuck up a nigga mind ahk
While they was into girls with the Reeboks
I was into fast cars, Pontiac T-tops
Fly nigga, I was the black Fonz
Chick magnet, pull a bitch out the salon
Kept me a mean, bad one
Hop in the whip with her weave half done

Took the stand, suddenly, caught amnesia
Found him in the warehouse, tied in the freezer
That's the life of a thug when he hold heaters

Lay me in the earth with the Armani linen

Hit him on the hill, Jake wonder where the medal went
Jump in the Ac-u-ra, then blast a trey
Pour this A for those who passed away

While on Riker's Island, fake niggas eat a dick rhymin
Mighty chrome we got a song

In his windpipe, we'll go to war until you pre-write
Pick tight, can stick to guns in a gunfight
Yo lots of diamonds, the new millenium was promised
Black comments, we tryin to squash that big
But niggas get hard-headed, filled wit leaded
Fuck around and get deaded, now for wetted

General of rap swarmin
Acousiastic, attract with the Glock plastic
Move quickly, switch rides to Poughkeepsie
Black tipsy, but tell me, destiny
Move quickly, stickheads, be tryin to stick me
You mad morbid, but it's a planet out of orbit
Can't absorb it, but tell me, you all for it

Yo, yo, they said I’m back on my bullshit
But how the fuck I’m back on some shit I never left in the first place?
Throw them niggas a party right at they birthplace
Same niggas got murdered right on they birthday
And they ain’t even talkin’ no retaliation
They just rather pay to squash the beef, that’s just how they cakin'
Hamhock, slime, no turkey bacon
Astaughallah the team, they whole crew forsaken
I’ma throw a hail mary like Manning Payton
Touch down on the ground, now they all hatin’
Said I’m back on my bullshit
But how the fuck I’m back on some shit I never left in the first place?
If I'm comin' in second, I’m shootin’ first place
We be buckin’ each other, but that’s the worst case
I told ‘em all chill for the time being
Barbecue the meat
Like some wild South North Koreans
Options that I got, I ain’t gotta be in
Have ‘em in Louisiana
New Orleans mausoleum
Jays on my feet, what I’m supposed to be in?
‘Cause I’m O.G., Kenneth Cole, nahs, that ain’t me an’
Said I’m back on my bullshit
But how the fuck I’m back on some shit I never left in the first place?
I ain’t fuckin’ with clowns that caught a court case
Rip out they bottom lip, jaw
Now they North Face
I used to re-up from a Colombian
Underground, Harriet Tumble-in, dumblin'
Buck through the hallways, staircases and rumblin'
Runnin’ through the blocks
Noseguards, it’s no fumbling’
Shorty said I’m gorgeous, attractive
Bitch I’m every day in the streets
I’m still active
They said I’m back on my bullshit
But how the fuck I’m back on some shit I never left in the first place?
I shoot it at some snitch, that’s the worst face
He should die on a cross, right in the church place
And we ain’t gotta talk, nigga it’s curfew
I hurt you, them eyes in your circle, that’s purple

YouTube distributed, iPhone equipped with it
MySpace can get with it, beef gone, did your bid

I feel invincible, I feel invisible
Cause you niggas can't see where I come from
The diddy-dum, the gun where you run from
N.O.R. basically with 'Pone make greatfully

Yeah, yo, see money is power, power put the fear in a nigga heart
A high school dropout but I'm mainly trigger smart
Einstein of the corner, I learned to cold trade
Low fade, half-moon park to get mo' paid
Take a walk with me, all white Air One Nikes on
Through the land of gun slingers and pipe dons
I'm parallel to hell with ice on, stones is canary
A thousand pennyweights of the Virgin Mary
I draw that big burner, might cause a solar eclipse
A true thug's prophecy, money over a bitch
Get consignment on a ki', that's hitting that hood lotto
Do right by your niggas, bet nothing but good follow
Tip your glass up, salute and have a toast to your enemies
Every nigga locked in the pen is a kin to me
Crowding at 9-5, I don't need no problem with troopers
Cause they even do you dirty with money like Frank Lucas


The recession got niggas wilding out on the max
And the mediums in regular jails is cold facts
And niggas back home ain't doing good either
They foreclosed on homes, no home grown neither
Now everybody hurting, walk around with the zombie face
Hit the marines or hit the army place

Aiyyo I bang Rugers, used to have a fetish for revolvers
Till I squeezed off the MAC-10, it made me heartless
Gang bangers love me, throw it up like they nauseous

Ayo, pass my phone
Those bitches calling you now?
It ain’t no bitch. No bitches even got my number

See I was wakin’ up
Out of my sleep, holdin’ my heat
Got a call from Khadafi sayin’ “Call me back Papi""
I rushed to the bathroom to bust me a leak
Charged my phone for a second ‘cause I knew it was deep
I know Trag, and Trag ain’t afraid of no beef
But he fuck with bottom-feeders and them niggas is creeps (True)
Called him back, he ain’t answer, I got a little worried
Text messaged him quick, said “Call me back, hurry!""
I rolled a blunt and I tried to relax
This nigga put me on, gotta show him love, that’s facts
Phone rang, and I picked up, like “What up slime?""

Peace god, I’m in Miami, don’t take it in vain
On Biscayne with three Italian bitches goin' insane

I said god, no disrespect, while I’m smokin’ this joint
But it’s late night, nigga gotta get to the point

Won't make a long story longer, so I’ll cut to the chase
Fuckin’ with the boss wife, the bitch showed me the safe

It ain’t a shock, I got some Haitian niggas out in Opa-Locka
And some goons up in Overtown, they’ll do it proper
But the thing is, they don’t wanna what they work for
They just wanna kill shit
Niggas never out of line, they just wanna kill shit

Real talk, real spit gorilla shit in my vibe
I g’ed her for the combination and I saw bout nine
I ain’t talkin’ , this is actual facts
Matter of fact, I’ma boomerang ‘Pone on this Jack

Ayo slime, what up man? I’m boomeranging you, man, ‘cause I got off the phone with the Deuce and all that. (Aight, what he saying?) You know slime on this good guy shit. I got three bitches, I got three bangin’ Italian bitches, nigga. Look, we can bring this shit back, forward and all that, the aura’s gracious
One bitch is from Star Island, my nigga. The other bitch? She from motherfuckin’ Coconut Grove. And the bitch I’m fuckin’ wit’, feel me, she from motherfuckin’ Golden Beach, son
This shit is poppin’, my nigga (Whassup?!)
Word is born, I need you

Aight
Got some niggas in the Grove
Gun stay hot as the stove
My Little Haiti niggas out of control
All they need is a whereabout to air it out
Escape to the stash house in West Palm
Chill Mahdi, you know we do this best calm
Word to my left arm
You my right hand
We in it for life, fam
Just give me the address
My niggas right there in a white van
I spoke to Cadeuce
He was like, damn, slime caught up in a light jam
I be there in a minute
My mind zonin’, thinkin’ 'bout all of them stacks
Made a call to my  had to give ‘em my facts
""Rich boss and my nigga fuckin’ his wife
He know where the safe at
But yo, we gotta thug ‘em tonight
Here’s the game plan, she gonna let him know when his plane land
And text slime the code to the gate and the door
You could hide in the closet ‘cause the safe in the floor""
Fast forward ‘bout nine PM
He pulled up in a lime BM
Puffin’ a Cuban cigar
Made his way to the boro and the door’s ajar
My nigga hopped out, threw the heat to his face
Said
“Me nah wan’ hurt you, bwoy
Where the key to the safe?""
He gave it up quick
Lookin’ at these niggas with dreads
Knowin’ one false move they probably fill him with lead
Took the bread, hopped back in the whip
In about 45 minutes met the whole team back on the strip
Split the loot up - 85 racks apiece

If I loan money i want it back with interest

Found my D in flipping the wrist
If you were a pock you can't see
Get high off the yapee
And get sloppy
Emphatically in al desiphor am a good with the wine
You hit this shit one time man this shit was flown in
Hydroponic weed it was water it was grown in
It’s getting me paranoid my mind start zoning
Ok pass me the bamboo I’m blank I’m about to go and get more
Whats up with Trav J
My brain frozen that shit will make Gone or the donkaden the Omen
Plenty bad bitch with me that will be how we rollin
Sometime watching her twist is even better than brain
I said when I’m on the bubble skunk metal
I came a long way from enditement
Jacqueline Hyde you use to get a free zipper bag
Better than five pound be some pot heads
CNN yea we chi chi chong hold up
Fuck a bowl you can keep your bong blow blow


Yea am in the distribution burgatory
Cocaine to sell a story only sold the product though
Always heard it's better for me
What got and got to go a rocking burgatory
Money on the elevator in my pocket showing
Elevation persuasion I land with an asian
Her friend caucasian less than United Nation
Ok mountains of cayucos asians
Rise for the cause my cause more amazing
Never be cubili relations i need locations
I’m good with that vovalvodo
Drop it like domino
Falling like its show debt in fresh press small
Smoke more or less stress we going to legalize it
Am going to head west
Innovative clip sprayers break walls with majors
Imallayers surrounds my neck while ice glacors
Laying on acres every shooters from my hood is famous
The handcuffs can't fit it's too big for the cages


Knowledge to edge take the pledge off the glory
Paint time visualize now you know the story
Never trust a label neither invoicing the statement
Housing and tenements I’m not the one to play with
Spit the 88th ward that crack i laced it
Like I’m still in Karl’s hall slinging the grey shift
You stoned like medusa
Don't worry about pulling up

Now I'm from Iraq, I got stories to tell

Would of done, could of did, niggas really need to quit it kid
Stay at home with pepper spray, think he can drop weight

And whoever going first, forever the dot face

Bringing the Gods Back,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Got the Gods with me tonight!
Learn your lessons young blood!
I civilize the uncivilized
CNN enterprise, niggas in the prize
I build with the First Born
, my mac squeeze
Still bringing back degrees, hustle for hustle
We needin' matching keys
I rest on the best part of the planet
Q.U., my counter top's marble and granite
I learned 120, little niggas earn from me
I trick, recoup while spendin' burnt money
I learned lessons, revolve around mathematics
Fly nigga rock' Louis V designer fabrics
Knowledge of Self, I'm one with the Gods and the Earths
Respect the shooter, 'Pone was a problem at birth
I'm a swiper, ill with the MasterCard
My coke come back white like its Master Fard
Yeah, I don't deal with the PAC math
Plus degrees, First Born get the last laugh

Let me tell you 'bout this knowledge man
Let me take it down in three basic fundamentals man
Knowledge, Wisdom, and Understanding
Knowledge is to know man
Knowledge is the Black man
Knowledge is the foundation of everything in existence
Knowledge means to listen, observe and also respect
You gotta respect these lessons!

Bringing the Gods back
We're try'na save some lives
Especially our babies, save the 85s
A civilized man's main goal is to teach
Where'd the Father start?  He started in the streets!

Yo you lose plus I got the ill street blues
Fuckin' red bottoms get you shot in your shoes
This is alcohol lyrics, paraphernalia flow
Grown man bars, iPhone stereo
Have you not heard your word is your bond
And your bond is your life
I sacrifice, civilized, touch nobody's wife
Still be rollin' dice, while you was praisin' fat cats in the 'jects
I would study 'bout the Father, build 'bout Clarence X
Sodom Gomorrah, you dudes the same sex
I used to be outer space like a comet
And drink Smirnoff till I vomit
Woke up in the East and payed homage
About to change my name to Salaam N.O.R.E. Muhammad
What happened?  We're supposed to be the Holy City
Bartendaz got me joggin' through the Holy City
So mind up, this is combat for brain waves

Khadafi Talks,Lessons (Deluxe Edition),2015.0,"When we first started
Together on the first album
You know, The World Report
It’s like, I more or less had the general position
I was the general in the team
Or the infantry or however you want to term it
And you know, I’m not gonna they were like
I’m not gonna say they were soldiers
You know what I mean
But they were more like field n*ggas
You know what I’m saying
They was heavy in the field
They was deep in the streets and all that
I had more experience
You know what I’m saying
I had dropped intelligent hoodlum pride to that
I was with the juice crew and all that but
So when we came together
Like I said
I had more of the vision of where things should be
How it would go or whatever
But as time progressed each one of us
You know what I’m saying
Grew and at the same time they grew a lot more
So today now when we come together to the tables you know
We come together as not only just generals we all commanders now
You know everybody done built up their stripes and stars
And their resume speaks for theyself
Cuz if you look at it
Each one had their own level of success
And identified themselves as solo entities
You feel me
As their own individuals
So now it’s a whole different type of  aura it’s a whole
The cycle is complete now
And that’s what counts man
That’s why it’s the new 5 %
Not in terms of like we’re not trying to change the degrees
We’re not trying to change the lessons in terms of
You know what I’m saying
How we build as guards and all that or how the guards build with
Or the foundation of that
What we’re saying is
We’re the new 5% within ourselves
Like this is our new lessons in terms of where we came from
This is the new 5%
We’re us right now
You feel me
And that’s what we are",https://genius.com/Capone-n-noreaga-khadafi-talks-lyrics
