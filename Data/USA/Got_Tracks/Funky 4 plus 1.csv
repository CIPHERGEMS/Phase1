That’s The Joint,That’s The Joint,1980.0,"If you’re ready for this (Say you’re ready for this)
If you’re ready for this (Say you’re ready for this)
Are you ready for this? (We’re ready for this)
Are you ready for this? (We’re ready for this)
Well, we just can’t miss (We just can’t miss)
Well, we just can’t miss (With a beat like this)
 IT’S THE JOINT!

We’re gonna prove to the world that we’re the real
We’re gonna prove to everybody we know the real deal
We got golden voices and hearts of steel
‘Cause we’re five emcees that got to be real
We’re here for the party people on Sugar Hill
So what’s the deal? (Sugar Hill!)
So what’s the deal? (Sugar Hill!)
 THAT’S THE JOINT!

These words we said we want y’all to hear
We’re gonna make a lot of sense (We’re gonna make it clear)
We’re gonna rock this place, we’re gonna use some class
We’re gonna do our best (We’re gonna make it last)
We got rhymes on our mind, we got rockin’ in our heart
A lot of things we do, you can call it art
We’re bad, we’re slick, we’re doing it hip
We’re gonna rock this record (And don’t you forget)
 THAT’S THE JOINT!

Because Li’l Rodney C is the melody
Keith, help me rock, we’re singing harmony
Because Jeff is the rhythm and K is the bass
Sha-Rock rock, shockin’ the whole darn place
Now here’s a little story you got to be told
The party people in the place got a whole lot of soul
So when we’re on the mic, y’all shocking the house
And we all get together, we can turn it out
Now we’re in the house as you can plainly see
Everybody say, “Get funky! Get funky!
And make money! And make money!”
And you don’t stop…
 GIVE IT TO US NOW!

To the beat that makes you want to rap
C’mon, Sha-Rock, cut out the crap
Just turn on the mic and start the rap
And let everybody know you can never be the wack
You know that! And you know that!
And I know (and she knows) And we know that!
We know what, Sha-Rock?
That when I rap, Funky Four, I can never be the wack!
And when you hear Sha-Rock…
 SHE’S THE JOINT!

What up, y’all? And do-do it up
And Sha-Rock is gonna show you how you get real rough
I’m Sha-Rock and I can’t be stopped
For all the fly guys, I will hit the top
Well, I can do it for the ones from weak to strong
I can do it for the ones that are right and wrong
Well, I’m listed on the column that’s classified
I can be a nurse and I’m qualified
To talk about respect, I won’t neglect
My strategy is for you to see
So don’t turn away by what I say
‘Cause I’m on, I’m bad when I’m talking to you
There are four fly brothers who can do it, too
The party people in the place, this is for you
So get down, get, get, get on down
I’m the Plus One More and I’m throwing down
(She’s the best female in this here town!)
And everybody knows that I’m golden brown
And you know…
 SHE’S THE JOINT!

For the young lady with nice fine thighs
I’m the kind of emcee that make women jet fly
I’m Jazzy Jeff with the most finesse
I’m down with The Five to rock the mic the best
‘Cause I move the groove and I do it cool
And I rock for you and you, I’m sure to rule
‘Cause I want a young lady with a lot of finesse
She’s got to be on (‘Cause he’s Jazzy Jeff)
She’s got to be sweet, fine, and kind
She’s just the kind of woman that’s got to be mine
And you know…
 HE’S THE JOINT!

Now what you see is what you get
You say I am bad and that you can bet
I have a quality for you and me
To all the young ladies, this is what it be
(You say his name is Keith Keith) As my rhymes go down
To all the young ladies, just gather around
With the rhymes I possess, the words I protest
And I can put together, I can call it finesse
Now, listen up, my ladies, and listen up good
I’m gonna rock on the mic like I know I could
(Like you know he should) Like I know I would
(He’s Keith Keith) I rock the house
(He’s Keith Keith) I rock, shock, rock, turn it out
And you know that, (and he got) the finesse
To behold that…
 HE’S THE JOINT!

Keeping on to, to the crack of dawn
Party people in the place, you got to keep on
If you like the beat and you want some more
Scream it out, and say, “Funky Four!”
(“FUNKY FOUR!”) “Plus One More!”
(“Plus One More!”) Now you don’t stop
You see the beat goes on ‘cause our power’s strong
We won’t stop rocking till you’re all getting on
And the ooh, ahh, ooh, ooh, ahh, ahh
Ooh, ahh, and don’t stop, get it!
 THAT’S THE JOINT!

We have an obligation that we must fulfill
Like a .357, we out to kill
We’re like Machine Gun Kelly and Bonnie and Clyde
We shock the house, we stand side by side
We’re on top of the world here, looking down
We’re going straight up hit, we never turning around
Because we are so close, but yet so far
And to all the party people, you know who we are
[Drum roll…} GET THE POINT?
If you don’t, we want y’all to know
We’re down, we rock, we the Funky Four
Plus One!

I was sitting at my house, watching my TV
When all of a sudden, it dawned on me
That I was all alone, just wasting my time
So I grabbed a pen and paper and wrote down a rhyme
As I thought to myself how nice it would be
To be on top, making cash money
To go on a tour, all around the world
To tell little stories to all the fly girls
To sit on my throne, to command my own
To be number one on the microphone
Just telling the tale about how it’s gonna be
For the Funky Four, Plus One emcees
We be busting in and we be turning it out
While we rock to any beat without a doubt
Just chilling hard, living in luxury
And being very proud to be an emcee
 HE’S THE JOINT!

Well, I kick it, Rockwell, ‘cause I raise a lot of hell
And I like to make love to the jealous females
And I’m down with the groove to mark it here
Now walk through my door, you pose on the floor
First is touching hips galore
(And then he) Move right up, (And then he) Kiss your lips
(And then he) Hold on tight so I never slip
(And then he) Tongue you down, on to the ground
If any love is there, it will be found
And I’m the man, you all can tell
I, Rockwell, to the depths of hell
And every time you hear my name, girl, it rings a bell
And when the bell rings, it goes “ding dong!”
And then I rock her and I shock her till the break of dawn
Like a hot buttered on bag of popcorn
Like Rockwell, just singing your song
And you know…
 HE’S THE JOINT!",https://genius.com/Funky-4-1-thats-the-joint-lyrics
Rappin And Rocking The House,That’s The Joint,1980,"This is the way we rock the house

The reason why 'cause I'm the women pleaser]
Well I'm Jazzy Jeff with the most finesse
Say I do it to the rhythm 'til I do it the best
Now we're the funky four 
and I'm the plus one more
And this is the way we go back and forth
We're the five MC's y'all all too much
When we rock the mic's, ah, with the magical touch
(We're on time, we're masterminds
We hittin' the top and we run down the rhymes)
They're four fly guys, I'm the best female
I'm tellin' the truth, not a fairytale
[Now listen to the story that the five put down
And it's guaranteed so let them travel around]
Now we said it once and we said it twice
Now we'll prove it to you that we're better than nice
[Verse 2: Lil Rodney C + 
Jazzy Jeff
]
Well... let's go to work, let's go to work
Let's go to go to go to go to go to go to work
Now when I say your name and I talk about your game
And I tell everybody how you got your fame
And when it's time to say oh yeah
Boogie to the rhythm like you just don't care
If you come to a party four boys turn out
You be prepared for DJ Breakout
When you come on back you wanna do it again
You be prepared for DJ Baron
If you come to our party to hear quality
You be prepared for the five MC's
If you come to our party to hear clientele
You be prepared for K and Rockwell
If you come to our party to hear history
You be prepared 'cause I'm Lil Rodney C
If you come to our party 'cause you wanna be shocked
You be prepared for the girl Sha Rock
If you come to our party to feel relief
You be prepared for my mellow Keith Keith
If you come to our party to hear the best
You be prepared 'cause he's Jazzy Jeff
If you come to our party to move your feet
You be prepared for my mellow Jazzy D
Now when come to our party and you don't wanna go
You blame it all, 
you just blame it all
I said you blame it all 
on the Brothers Disco
See we got a little story we want you to know
Check it out, everybody this is how we go
Say tic-tac-toe, we're all the go
We're a four sure shot of a disco show
We're the sure shot hit, of a four sure shot
So come on young ladies, use what you got
'Cause we're five MC's that rock jazzy
And there is the no one else who can't compete
'Cause when we rap on the mic we take control
We can turn out any party with the voices of gold
'Cause we're to hot to handle, to cold to hold
Because MC stands for mic control
And when it comes to that we are the best
We can rock the north, south, the east, and west
With the tower of the power can you understand
And we can turn out any party with the mic in our hand
Because we got it like that, can you do it like this
Our names are on top of the MC list
I say we advertise to mesmerize
And we specialize to antagonize
I say we qualify to neutralize
We'll make other MC's apologize
We got the personality to rock the young ladies
The authority to rock you to your knees
The convince-a-ty for all the youth to see
We want you to know the identities
Of the five MC's with the capabilities
I mean the rock and the mic cause anxiety
We want our name to be preached to every nationality
We got styles and finesse we be the almighty
MC's 
with
 ability
To rock on and on and on
And on and on and on
You just dip, dive, and socialize
Party to the rhymes of the four fly guys

One-two, one-two, one-two, two
A-two, a-two, a-two, two
Just rockin', just rockin', just rockin'
Rockin', rock, rock a rockin'
Rockin' for the women
So we make a little cut that'll make you move your butt
And our bass'll blow you away
And have the Funky 4 MC for the young ladies
And we're sure enough here to stay
And now you look us in the eyes then you get hypnotized
Then throw us a little kiss
And then we'll whisper on the mic something real polite
And it goes a little something like this
We're the funky four MC's
With the hypnotize rhymes that rhyme
Together, together
'Cause the rockin' don't stop when the times
Those times are better, are better
The other MC's that bite our lines
In the past present future we'll leave them behind
When will they ever learn the Funky Four MC's are one of a kind?
Yeah, so dip, dive and recreate
We're gonna rock this place at a marchin' pace
Jump hop and just keep in step
And check out the MC's got their rep
We're the best darn group in the whole wide state
And if you didn't hear us yet ya'll are too late
We're the frisco, frisco, brothers disco
Can't be beat 'cause we rock so sweet
Can't be stopped 'cause we hit the top
We're the voice on the planet
I know you can't stand it
To all the young ladies, don't take for granted
We're the dogs through the time, won't make you mine
With the rhyme, with the lines all mastermind
I said the other MC's have the golden voice
But we're the ones that you'd made ya' choice
And all we wanna do is make you moist
'Cause we're not say yes, we're not say no
But all you gotta know is that we rock the boat
Now we're the Funky Four, we rock so well
It's easy to see we have the most clientele
We rock it slow, we rock it fast
We make you rock until you feel the blast
And don't you be enslaved by the people say
That we're the whack
'Cause they're playing with ya head
And that's a fact y'all, that's a fact y'all
So rock, rock, you don't stop
And keep on 'til we rock the sure shot

From a lemon to lime
Lime, lime to a lemon
From a lime to a lemon
Lemon, lemon to a lime
And he cuts the beat
In half the time
And not a fork, not a plate
Not a cut is late
He doesn't miss a cut
That he suppose to make
The Baron got cuts galore
Breakout got cuts galore
He said party people in the house
We never gave a party that we didn't turn out
We're the Funky Four we're here to attest
We got rhymes galore you must confess
We're the F-U-N-K don't forget the Y
They're the master of the mixing
We're the masters of the rhyme
And you stand at the front
And you get surprised
We're the Funky Four and we're qualified

I'm Lil' Rodney C and I'm heading for the top
And I'm Keith Keith to the sure shot beat
Say I'm Jazzy Jeff, my rhymes are so sweet

The man with the rock that can't be stopped
They call me Kid the Rock cause I am so fly
Young ladies out there you can't deny
That I'm one of the best and I'll beat the rest
And I told the less that they can hit the west
You hear a MC with word on ya mind
But never like mine cause mine are divine

Like a little old body of water I reside?
Sweet, bad, cooling out
Ah, while I rock for my man
I call the Breakout
I wanna cruising round the world in my yacht
I wanna go to Hawaii where everything's hot
Wanna go to the island where all the girls are
Wanna boogie in Bronx 'til the break of dawn
I wanna sail the seven seas, wanna do as I please
I wanna have other girls like a deadly disease
I wanna meet the president, shake his hand
I wanna go through the states and preach through the land
Wanna hear my name yelled from miles away
While I'm sitting at home just collecting my pay
I want my  to be big, my pockets real fat
Want everyone to know that where am at

And I'm ready to rock to any funky beat

There's no limitations to my finesse
Got the modifications to alterate
I won't bite the rhyme and I won't imitate
Another MC when he's running down rhymes
'Cause half the time he's just running down mine
But that's all right because I know someday
I'll put him in check and take his rep away
Because my name is know from land to land
'Cause I'm a super fly guy with the mic in my hand
My name is known from sea to sea
And when I'm on the mic I cause modern history
I'm a mystic, magical man on the mic
When I run down a rhyme it'll be a delight
'Cause I'm a mean machine, a master plan
You see what I mean when there's a mic in my hand
'Cause I'm an inspiration all over the nation
I let you know that I'm a disco sensation
A, rock rock, y'all
Now I can kick the live on as you folks know
I can energize the sun to make things grow
I can harmonize the beat to put you in a trance
I can hypnotize your feet make you do a strange dance
I can fantasize your dreams and make em' all come true
I can magnetize a freak and make her rock with you
I can terrorize the world in a jazzy way

Young ladies won't ya come along

And then you rock to the beat and don't you dare stop
Just rock y'all, you don't stop
A keep on to the sure shot
'Cause I fit the name Keith and I said it 2 times
I picked the long name and started a rhyme
Up the ladder and onto the tree
We're the Funky Four MC and my names Keith Keith
Before I'm finished let me say this time
That my names Keith and you can say it 2 times
Keith Keith to the funky beat
And now the funk will never fly by myself
I wore pants on my jock 'cause I didn't have a belt
The pants I wore was so very nice
I had money in the pocket with 3 red dice
I saw this girl and she looked so fine
I said I looked to what's on my mind
I went over to talk for a while
When I found out that she had a child
I mind my business and moved away
I went to a phone to call a OJ
The OJ pulled up to the phone
It was dark green with a light green tone
Before I'm finished let me tell you straight
That the car at the phone was a vicious 98
I got in and we went for a cruise
We stopped at the liquor store to by some booze
We jerked around and went 8 blocks back
And I went in the cheeba house to by some black
We got so drunk and we got so high
That he hit his car and that ended the ride
We didn't get hurt, nobody died
So come on young ladies and ride, ride, ride
In my Mercedes, young ladies
If my Mercedes breaks down, because of 1 wheel
I pick you up in my new Seville
In my new Seville, I say do like that
I pick you up in my Cadillac
In my Cadillac I say
Who's to say that we did it
We go right-ay
Jazzy Jeff, don't stop
Just turn on ya' mic, just turn on ya' mic
Just turn on ya' mic when ya ready to rock

Check it out y'all and you don't stop
Keep on to the break of dawn
Keep on-on to the beak of dawn
I got a lot of potential, got a lot of class
When I run out of rhymes, I can do it fast
When I run out of rhymes, I can do it the best
And if you don't know who I am, my name is Jazzy Jeff
Because my voice is on, my styles on go
I'm rapping on the mic for the 
How there could never be another with more finesse
I'm gonna say it like I mean it, I'm Jazzy Jeff
Check it out y'all, ya' don't stop
Keep on to the break of dawn
It's a couple of people who we can't please
But we're here to rock, shock all the MC's
Who think there bad and think there good
We're gonna rock the house like they wish they could
So if ya' think ya' on and got a lot of finesse
Baby step to the side
Brother we are the best
We're the Funky Four
We're the new and improved
Just take a step back
We're coming through
We're gonna do it right
We're gonna put you in check
There's no doubt about it we demand respect
Don't be afraid, don't let ya heart stop
Ask anybody they will tell you we rock
'Cause it's not about game, it's all about fun
We came to rock the Funky Four plus One
I'm the one MC that's who could it be
The latest number one nominee
Because I got a little rep
And a dangerous style
I'm above MC's
I'm on top of the pile
Because I rhyme all the time
I mess with mine
I make MC's wanna bite my rhyme
I conceded myself as one of the best
'Cause I have in store the keys to finesse
My rhymes are slick my rhymes are bad
It's something other MC's never had
'Cause when I start to rock I just don't stop
I said def def rhymes no MC can top

If you think you're ready (If you're!)
Ready to get down
Claps your hands (And groove!)
Move to the sound
Get on the floor (And find!)
And find you someone
And you can bet (Bet that!)
You're gonna have some fun
So do you wanna get down (And rock!)
Do you wanna get up and party
Now everybody, it's time to rock somebody!
(Huh!)
Do you wanna rock, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna rock, are you willing to take the chance?
Do you wanna rock, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna rock, are you willing to take the chance?
A-to the hip hop, hip-hip the hop
Ya hip hip ya hop ya rock you don't stop
First you rock the hip, you gotta rock the hop
Then you rock with...Shaaaaa Rock
To all the fellas in the house, that's single and free
Take the time, drop a dime, sure you can could call me
Now I'm looking for a fella that I can't call jive
Doing something for himself, working 9 to 5
But you gotta dress nice, you gotta look fine
To have Sha Rock, you know I'm one of a kind
And if you think it's you, this is what you can do
(You can call her tonight! Call her tonight!)
You can call me tonight when the party is through
Well now I need a little help from everybody in the crowd
Won't you help me scream it out, just sing it out loud
Do you wanna rock, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna rock, are you willing to take the chance?
C'mon, c'mon sing!
Do you wanna rock, do you wanna dance? (Sound good!)
Do you wanna rock, are you willing to take the chance?
Do you wanna rock, do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna rock, are you willing to take the chance?",https://genius.com/Funky-4-1-do-you-want-to-rock-before-i-let-go-lyrics

King Heroin (Alternate Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hey fellas, what y'all got there?
Aw man, y'all messin' with the king
What king man? This is drugs homeboy, high-powered drugs
Oh, so that's what you call it?
Yeah, baby, yeah
I don't care what you call it, it's still the king
Man, king who?
King heroin brother
King heroin

The king is here, that's what I said
Have fun, take some, it's for your head
(King, king, king heroin, heroin!)
(King, king heroin, heroin!)
The king is here, that's what I said
It's good stuff, take a puff, it's for your head!
(King, king, king heroin, heroin!)
(King, king heroin, heroin!)
The king is here, that's what I said
That this, take a sniff, it's for your head!

Ha ha, king heroin you know me
I was raised in the land called poppy seed
Well I'm known by all throughout the world
By men, boys, women, all ages and girls
I've been used and abused by yes all sorts
Running with the politicians, causing trouble for sports
'Cause you can use me once you'll do it again
And if not by yourself, then uh, with a friend
I'll have you sniffin', noddin', I'll mess with your mind
I'll make you do it, commit all sorts of crime
I'll make a full grown man take off his watch
I'll send a greedy man to prison for the rest of his life
King heroin, you call me a drug
And yet you joke and smoke until you start to bug
I mean you spend all your money, you know you do
Because you want me, you haunt me, you know it's true
I come in nickles and dimes for the kids in schools
I come in fifties and hundreds for the bigger fools
'Cause I'm king!

(King, king heroin)
King!
(King, king heroin)
King!
(King, king heroin, heroin!)
King!
(King, king heroin, heroin!)

Some call me bad but treat me good
I get you so much treated like a fool
It's a doggone shame how you stick it in your vein
It's a real live thrill when you pop the pill
I'll make a mother hate her daughter, make a father beat his son
Make them treat their child wild 'cause I'm number one
Well I'm the reason, the cause, why you do wrong
I can turn you off and turn you on
I'm not a man, not a woman, I'm just a thing
But I rule your world 'cause I'm the king
Well you could call me speed or call me blow
Ask me to get you high, I'll never say no
I love pushers, addicts, all my users
'Cause one by one I turn 'em into losers
Hey I'm king-king heroin, I'm gonna get you high before I end, my friend

Well they better listen good 'cause I'm no joke
I was there when Richard Pryor went up in smoke
Well I warned him once but he didn't learn
I got a kick out of causing a grown man to burn
'Cause I'll do it to the stars, I'll do it to the cons
It was heroin that put away Nicky Barnes
So don't you laugh 'cause you ain't slick
Admit it, I'm a habit you just can't quit
Well I could be your best friend, I could be your enemy
This brother want blow, that brother want speed
Yes I love one and I love all
'Cause when you wanna get high I'm the one you call
Now some people I help, some people I hurt
Inside every one of you is nothin' but a jerk
'Cause all I do is mess with your brain
Make you depend, drive you insane
But you don't care 'cause you think it's cool
Playin' with the king like a doggone fool
Don't try to go straight 'cause it's too late
Face it, you're hooked, your mind I took
Don't plead to the lord, ain't nothin' he will do
About the speed, the blow, the people sniffin' glue
This goes for the addicts, the ones with the habits
Don't pray, just nod, heroin is your god!
(King, king heroin, heroin!)
(King, king, king heroin)

Hey, the Funky 4, how y'all doin?
(Alright) (What's up!) (What's happenin' man, how you doin' Jimmy?) (Alright) (What's goin' on?)
I'm just chillin', I heard you had a show tonight
(Yeah, we playin' tonight, we playin' tonight) (What's happenin'?)
Well you know me, I'm gonna pick me up a hit and I'll be right on my
(That sound kind of rough)
No, but excuse me baby, take it from a lady's point of view
Stay away from all the buddha, the 
You know I'm hip to king heroin, but all we want you to do is come to the party and be yourself
(That's right) (Just be yourself) (That's all it takes) (All them drugs are wrong man ) (Straight as an arrow)
(Heroin)
