Tonight’s Da Night,Whut? Thee Album,1993.0,"Mic check, I can get smooth to any groove
Relax the tongue, let my mic take a cruise
Around the planet, pack em in like Janet
Jackson, she's askin' if I can slam it
I'm—

Yo, yo, Redman, man, what the fuck, man?!
Get the fuck off that...punk smooth shit, man!
Get with that rough shit, man; you know how we do!

Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black TEC-9
By the waistline, kickin' the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to, show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that, the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat, son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo bust the slang, what my name?
It's the Redman on the funk train
Psyche, you're motherfuckin' right, tonight's the night
To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk! Pass the 40 and the blunt and don't front
On the block, 'cause when you do front, brothers are gettin' stomped
I'm not an addict, more like Puff the Magic
Then pass it when I'm through 'cause my crew...
(GOTS TO HAVE IT)
I don't claim to be a big rap star
'Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and 
take heed to what I'm sayin'
'Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggas ain't playin'

Fat black bitch! Nasty
Bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin' ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker!

You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
'Cause the lyrics and tracks, make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit, I get down with the boom bip
Like Q-Tip,
 I kick more styles than Bruce shoes kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like 
Mike 'n' Ike's
Hanging out with my niggas, my niggas
The 
Pack Pistol Posse
 keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the 40 between my lap, coolin', rollin' down the highway
Blunt system pumps 'cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
'Cause, we can do that black, so ""Get the Bozack"", Jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin' out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-BUMP, ba-BUMP, make ya speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump...jump, jump, jump
But if you want to see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic, more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
'Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by letting me make an album
(How come, rude boy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin' style run

Nasty fuckin' green thumb Jolly Green niggas
Tango mango, pickin' havin' ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin' ass
Johnny Cash
, afro havin'
Jack of Spades, boots havin'
Tony Danza, shoes wearin' ass!

B-b-b-black by popular demand, I expand
My hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the flim flam
I get sex, I get wreck, I puff mad blunts
I get vexed, I break necks, punch out gold fronts, chump
You—

Yo, fuck that, yo, turn this shit off, man
Turn this shit off, G
Boom the new record on, knahmsayin'?",https://genius.com/Redman-tonights-da-night-lyrics
Dunfiato,Muddy Waters 2: The Preload EP,2014.0,"Hey, hey
Muddy fucking waters mixtape, man
I'm high as a bitch  up in this motherfucker
I need a beat, I need a fuckin' beat
I don't need no turn up beat, I need some elements
Some Hip-hop
Let's get back to some elements and shit (yeah)
Josh, I like that man. You like that man?
Let's turn that shit up man (yeah)
Lyrical wordplay for y'all. I feel good on this one, man
This is how real emcees do it, you know?
Yeah, I like that shit a lot man
D'un fiato!
Rome, York, we in the building
Check it out (yo)

When I hit the bong I'm Godzilla taking over Hong Kong
Eating wantan wid' a shotgun in long johns
It's not unsung
No story here to tell, I'm just ready
I'm a student before the school bell
That prevail my wordplay
Thirsty, I bust all three Ks on Martin Luther King birthday
Berkeley College, for twenty dollars
If I got it, smoke, here enquire my knowledge
A little psychotic, I know
Rate me, I'm Michael Jordan in the final four fighting with Wayne Gretzky
I'm not relevant, let's see
Who's spittin?
Some of y'all Coke and Pepsi, I can't tell the difference
I'm Darryl when I'm pitchin'
Before the white girl had 'em twitchin'
Now the rap game in my kitchen
Easy pickens
Rebel wid' a cause
My mind is like fuck with mine, I'll put your mind on the wall
I'm on tour gettin' bread and tattoos and your job is giving Tic Tacs in bathrooms
I hate gossip, I'll mash up your media moshpit
Release a ba-boom in the chat room
My weed bags are vacuum that smuggle
Off of one blunt, a bitch gon' fuck you (HAHAHA)
Chicks Tivo the meatloaf, when I hit they belly Doc droppin' all dimes (RICO!)
Take precautions
I got a Paul Bearer that build coffins for all rappers and nonsense
Nonchalantly I'm thinkin' darker than a convict conscience
That's why I'm sweating in the armpits, that's where the bomb is
The gang rate in my city is like the 80s where Kendrick Lamar live
I gotta' harvest the purple at my apartment, across the park I sell pounds to Cartman
I think like an orphan, I'm in a zone
But it's freestyle so these words might need a home
Executive net, I demand respect, check, don't even talk to me or text the wrong tone (OKAY)
Stay at bay, um and delay
When I ride out, pull pins from these hand grenades
You can be amazed or hate it
But either way I get it heated like Kanye and Sway
I'm done wid' it, I had fun wid' it
Stay back and tell your girl come get it
She had Mr. Right, now she want Mr. Wrong
Now she swing along, like Serena arms",https://genius.com/Redman-dunfiato-lyrics

Look
Yo

No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep rappin' this way
No matter what you may think
I'ma keep doin' my thing

I'm the worst thing since fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing (Ahh!)
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causin' terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara (Come on, bitch)
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holdin' Tylenol in his hands
'Til it melts in his fuckin' palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol-whipped with a Mossberg
With a pistol grip, and fed pitbull shits
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits (Yeah!)
If I get too rich, I just get sued

Yo, I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo ninja
Crash it, Doc stir the madness
'Til y'all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walkin', cans in the laundry basket
America's Most, with the army after us
Fuck flossin', we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like an ace and four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
(Shit, the power's out) The tape is off!
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber, miss (Ts! Ts!)
Fade you with a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake (Kill, kill, kill)
Fuck bitches face is what I'ma do
'Cause that's what white boy Tano do

So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
'Cause uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this (Off the wall)
So how's everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you in that mood to get rude and ill in a fight

Yo, what my jabs are spittin', hospital, son, admit it
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, Doc. Marshall Maths? (Print it)
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I'm ""What's Happening,"" with no Re-Run
Doc. Rob De Niro when the heat come
My barrel hang out the Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes, it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogart it
Your wallet, your chain: the main target
Beef is like cold engine: don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten-speed and brown shoe
Doc and Eminem, cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them

It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stocked inside the lunch box (Uhh)
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good; thank God for vodka
'Cause with my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker (Ckkk!)
Probably got a fanatic waitin' upstairs in the attic
With a automatic callin' me up there (Watch up!)
My man, Stan, with a gat in his hand
Stakin' my house out in a tan, tinted sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn (Yeah)
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam (Yeah)
'Til you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey, Ma, maybe I'll give you a call
Psyche! You fuckin' bitch, suck a dick and two balls! (Hahaha)
I'm givin' you all my job descrip', which is
To piss bitches and priests off with this (""...Need Jesus!"")
Pop more pills 'til police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all! (Chm!)
'Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well just be a painting smashed on the floor (Ah!)

So how's everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you in that mood to get rude and ill in a fight
'Cause uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't wanna fuck to this (Off the wall)
So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and screw in a fight

Can’t Wait,Dare Iz a Darkside,1994.0,"Possibly a lot of rain this afternoon, with thunderstorms, highs in the mid-80s and lows about 75 degrees
It's 11:30 AM on WFDS—We're From the Darkside Radio
This is Dave Rockin' Reel, as we take a caller
Caller, you're on the air
Yeah yeah yeah, and this Roz from Newark and I wanna hear that tune ""Can't Wait"" by Redman—that tune the bomb, yo!
You got it, coming from The Darkside Radio, this is ""Can't Wait""

Whooooooo! Yo yo yo, comin' to you live
Smokin' mad Phillies with my niggas from the Hoodaville section
And all my niggas from the Weequahic section, word is bond
Somebody said Jamaica Queens in this motherfucker
I don't give a fuck! We gon' set it off like this
Jersey in the fuckin hid-ouse, for your mid-outh

I'm like rah rah, like I had cerebral palsy
My flows be's wet like all you girls' drawers be
Crack the Phills, spread the buddha then the hiddash
Roll it up and then ask, ""Who chipped in for the ten bag?""
Et cetera, I roll my blunts with two textures
Pick up fifty bags and then I smoke all the extras
It's the truth, like vodk' one-eighty proof
Don't drop your drawers, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes (True!)
Put your fingers up in the air if you're high (High)
I walk by (by) so eff a drive (by)
I swing up in it, batting average is half as
Good as Reggie Jackson's, that's why you talk backwards
And, uh, chumps be on some Bogart shit like Humphrey
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jump Street
Or 90210, fuck it, yo
In the movies I'm the nigga puffin' buddha in the back row

I can't wait to get it on
(You don't stop, keep on)

I'm just a smoky boy, I'm from the Land of the Lost
You can't see me, like Charlie Angels' boss, I'm often
Coolin 'round the blid-docks, I rock 'round the clid-dock
My glid-dock cocked, from here to 16th and Lenox
Ask Roger Thomas if I'm gettin scopic
I was milk like two tits, now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet
Now who got the funk? (We got the funk!)
Ay ay, ayo well I got the weed! (We got the blunts!)
I never sniffed, I used to puff woolas in a jam
Back in '88, when it was twenties to the gram
Brizzail, you couldn't feel me in Braille, hell
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin' L
The fly guy with the Force like Luke Sky'
Down for a menage e' trois bitch if you're fly
The Funkadelic, been rockin' mics since the fourth grade
I Terminate like X and I Terminate like Schwarzeneg'
Dum-de-dum, rock like Buju Banton
Soup like wonton, funk by the tons, ""D-Rums, Please!""
My whole crew's making cheese
Tonight's the night, baby, so suck up on these, and it's on

I can't wait to get it on
(Check it out, y'all)
I can't wait to get it on

I said I, catch the A-train, to the left
Smoke the choc', I set shit off like Boba Fett
Big up to all my niggas in the housing projects
I'm runnin' up in ya, continue to split your guts
Grab the rail, if you get scared of my lines when I rock well
Got Whit's like Pernell, shit's ""The Bomb"" like Akinyel'
Rickety rocket, mind deep as the Loch Ness
Waste niggas like toxic, wet like galoshes
Can I handle my biz? (Yes, you can!)
I cause chaos, and bring a lot of Def to Jams
Yes I can, now act stupid I'll pop the trunk, cla-clunk
Now give me a ba-bump, ba-bump
Oh cool, smooth like two ""Blue Suede Shoes""
Y'all faggots slept on my Huffman and Koos
Word to Dan, Tan, Pillow, and Cool B
Switchin' speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' a Fuji in a movie
I drop it on the one—fuck the two, three
Funky like a box of coochies on loose leaf

Yo yo, I said, ""Switchin' up speeds like Bruce Lee ridin' a Fuji in a movie.""

While I crack a cold Beck's and keep the hoes in check
The double-S vest nigga wreck the discotheque
Sit back relax and while my Squad kick tacks
Then tap your man back and be like ""Did you see that??""
Ahh yes, comin from the North South East West
Hold your nose and take a deep breath, recess
We bless, mics, three times a day
Three times a night, it all equals subliminal sequels
Strictly laughing at MC's
Lyrics for years that run more than ten deep
Niggas be like ""Ahh he changed his style up""
Shut the fuck up, ya still a dick-ridah
It's '96 so get wit' it
Keep that back-in-the-day shit when that other Squad was Hit-tin
Listen, must we forget, I originated
All that wild shit, that rrraahh rrraaoowww shit
That jump up and ready to fuck shit up now shit
Brick City!! Is where I get down kid
Peace to all my buddah smokers on Prince
Fuck what ya heard, Brick City runs shit

Pubic hairs and everything, lick the whole plate up
Bay Area, roll up your Las Vegas
To all MC's, I love it that you hate us
Drop skills that might send wind chill factors
Back through Patterson, J.C
And Hacken-sack
Step uncorrect and get blackened
The assassin, find da MC's by the jazz men
I don't tote guns I tote funds
While you still puzzled how my antidote runs
Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it
Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it (Get on down)
You remind me of school on a Sunday
No class, beatin all King's down
Doin over seventy, in a Hyundai, blast
Give em a good reason to open Alcatraz back
Nobody got the Red shook
Been a weirdo ever since the doctor said PUSH
Def Squad skills make it hard to overlook me
That's why the hardcore promoters still book me
You shook G... word up... hah hah...

Then we buy G's with a half a pound of dope MC's
We bag for cheese just to get weed

Oh-seven-one-oh-three, rest them car thieves
Guzzlin quart for sports of all sorts
Nonchalant spark buddah on the front porch
At courts, F-U-N-K-D-O-C
S-P-O-T, feel the Solo type remedy
Then freeze.... (Get on down) hah, ha-hah
Where was I? Oh yes
Sippin on Cristal with fingers up your bitch dress
Don't play close cause jealousy make folks act loc
Another nigga smoked from impression
Second guessin my verbal weapon, you're lettin
Spit, sixteen bits, come equipped
And I still walk around with the hooked up
Motorola flip on my hip, fuck the government
Drop shit, it's a microscopic topic
How I stay mo' bent than McDonald arches
And uptown got the la-la spots
And bad ass hoes with 54-11 Reeboks
But still, I walk around with the grill
Cause niggas be blinded by this hip-hop shit for real
I ain't havin that, I'm clappin shit
Fuck this rappin shit, I cause accidents
To any, MC who wonder what got in me
To get busy, it's simply Ginger and Remi

Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal
And I ain't feeling... anything
When I roll the bomb, alright alright, its Gillahouse

Rollin up the marijuana bud
Jack Herer, Uh in the blood
Redman, my codename Cheech
Hash burns all in my carseats
I was a Baby Boy"" like Tyrese
Hittin the L before ""Rock the Bells"", release
Mr. Green, yeah thats me, got the knockout bud, the muhammad a-leaf
Young as a Bob Marley when I speak
Po-po I hide the bud in the briefs
The highest of highs, your boys on fire
Smokin with me is like trying to ""Get Him to the Greek""
420, I light up the kief, I'm a Wiz at getting the Curren$y in the streets
Bill Clinton said he hit weed in his speech
I smoke sour everyday of the week nigga, PREACH

I smoke purp to the haze
Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal
And I ain't feeling... anything
When I roll the bomb, alright alright, its gillahouse

Smoke with you. 
The fire. 
Come smoke with me 
Let's go get higher
This booooomb, its a sensation
Now breathe it in, all in your system
YEAH

Blunt filled with kush, cheese, purple, and sour diesel
I call that smoking reefer
I keep weed in my system, and truth be told I get higher than Blake Griffin
And just imagine what I'm sipping, to drink this your gonna need a prescription
So it better be highgrade if you selling me
And never start no cypher without telling me
Cup empty, I need a refill
Something to chase this E pill
I hit my dealer at 3 AM
I wonder if he got hash still
Cause Gillahouse is what I'm reppin'
I stay high, get fly, I'm a Jetson
Now I'm on my high horse like a Western
And I never leave the house without protection
That's something that pastor can't preach
But that's something a jail could teach
To get high we put our money on weed, and we probably spend it all cause the sour ain't cheap

Smoke haze to the cheese
Smoke cheese to the kush
Smoke kush to the sourdeezal

(LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE!)
In this corner we have the funk bodysnatcher
P-Funkadelic and I gat ya
Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an Avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause '92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk
Knock all of their gold tooth loose (POW!)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on
You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10
Then 1, 2, 3, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk
Pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice than 2Pac

You heard me, my brother, I'm laughin' (he he he he he)

Straight from the Land of the Lost
I'mma hit you with the funk force
That make you run your rap style back to the crack aisle, brotha
Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk, chump, dump a trunk of funk
In your skull caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw rap
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(THE FUNKY FLY STUFF)
Come on and let me kick
(THE FUNKY FLY STUFF)
Just to show you where the HELL I COME FROM
I get dumb with the 1, 1-2
Check my rep from my hip when I have sex
(LIKE THIS)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, OOPS, brother, where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour lyric funk down your brain, punk
Listen to my name, chump
(REDMAN READY TO ROCK)
I got a Glock
THEN, POW! Your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to this, the Exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when Twin cock the biscuit
And blow your head off
Just for asking ""Who's the one rapping?""

Word is bond, I gotta show them the flava....

Get my weed from Branson cause his sack's bigger, yo give me dap nigga
What I clap lyrically tap call back
Ferocious causing comatoses to collapse
So chinky eyed I see people waving on a map
I make it hotter than your thermostats
Bomb MC's with rough megahertz so call me
Funk Doctor verbal starburst, lyrical expert
Your boombox better form a union
Cause I leave your circuits overworked, word bond
Niggas front like they want it
But I be in the five hundred with E steadily getting blunted
Damn nigga you cool at what you spitting
So why you holding the blunt so long politicking
Huh, I ace them blunts with the technician of electrician
I don't got a pot to piss in but still spend my last on 
hydroglycerin
I keep it live no jive rolling Dutches

I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of 'em wasn't graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang? Yeah boy I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come, harder they fall
That goes for, knuckleheads MCs, pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whupped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin mics and area codes
Now, PPP the kinda niggas that'll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya, later on stick a slug in ya
Everything that's light green ain't the bomb bitch
I got different forms to make you lose your calm bitch
Read my lips, you ain't hitting unless you got
Ten on it, get on it, or get the fuck out my cypher

How To Roll A Blunt,Whut? Thee Album,1992.0,"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww SHIT!!
Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins a new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the Phillie Blunt continues
The flava's the P-Funk y'all, get wit it
Check it out...

Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll carry more blunts than Archie Bunk'
First of all, you get a fat bag of ism
From Uptown, any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a Phillie—not the city of Philly, silly punk
I'm talking about the cigar, the Phillie Blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Phillie Blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use your fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion, then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit your lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmmmmmmm....proper

That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up
(Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
(Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah

The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like pure ass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
(Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt. uh yo, here's the lighter..)
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with your spit, shit
I dunno what dick or last puss' you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't wanna break their Lee nails
(hee hee hee hee hee, sorry Red for spilling it...)
 You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill
And for spilling it, you better get lost or get grill
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo don't know to roll a blunt

That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah
(""Hey, nigga, pass the goddamn blunt. Shit! What you holding it all day for?)
Sit yo' big ass down...

Yo, yo, check this out
I want all the real niggas out there and the females too
If you got a fat blunt in ya mouth and you feeling high as hell
I want y'all to repeat after me, check it out
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell)
Yeah
Last but not least, Redman like to say peace
To all the blunt rollers from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme a blunt when I kick the bucket
Devil or no devil, when high, I am the wrong one to be fucked with
So everybody, put they blunt up in the air
Take a puff, blow the smoke out like ya just don't care
So...(pump up the volume)...so it's heard thru the next block
I'm out, peace to Redd Foxx, I'm off to the cess spot...
Yeah, DJ Twinz in the house
Yeah, Redman's in the house
Yo, peace to Pack Pistol Posse, the 4,5,6
Yo, I'm out

Clock the squeal, the MC overkill
Certified cylinders 35 mil'
Jumpin out planes, Doc's Da Name
Cock the flame, back to relieve the pain
Hater, IKSRFO don't Piscopo
Hit the safe for cake, shoulda switched the code
Nigga, sneak a pound through custom drug hounds
Bound to rob your neighborhood Waldbaum's
Me and my man jumpin' out Sedans
Tappin' your jaw, like Sugar Ray did Duran
I, execute like wars in Beirut
Twenty-two inch rims to parachute out the Lex Coupe
The rhythm hit 'em without the venom in 'em
Pin 'em skin 'em with the shit, I pull out the John Lennon
Ha, dog style your girl, smokin' a lot
I been had a demo before ""Ridin' High""
Buy a whip straight up, cash out the car lot
Clorox your Fort Knox, til y'all call SWAT
Bite off your ear for a souveneir
Switch from Red to Roy, give you Primal Fear
If you don't know the click then you're smokin' wet

Right on, my palm is like the cape on Spawn
Active frequency, trip the car alarm
Ribbit Ribbit Ribbit, got moves to make
Choose the date, today you hallucinate
Smokin me out without war, torn, ghettoes
Opposite of Goodfellas, Dinero
Go to any borough who rock the mic thorough
Got your wife sayin, ""Not tonight, hello!""
Money talk, bullshit walk, ask Chris
The baptist, roll Garcia's with hashish
You need classes for practice to tap this
Jurassic crab shaft nasty ass bitch
Hot potato, drop the data
Guard your Emancipation Proclimator
Lock shit down, cock the pound - no doubt
As a juvenile, brought cazals off canal
Brick City be the pros at wildin' out
Off at the mouth, get dressed like Thousand Isle
Got a degree, on the hash and the leaky
Crash in the V while we Master the P
I beez Bout It Bout It, causin low mileage
Blacka, make Zsa Zsa Gabor cha-cha
Spit somethin to you then turn your eyes cockeyed
Down with the Outz - ah ha ha, ha ha!
Yo tremblin, pickin up the pen again, adrenaline
Got impact like DJ threw on ""Benjamins""
Sentiment, hit you with your thongs and your Timberland
Fuck ya, rob ya, cops say, ""It's them again!""
Choke the fuck out, joke the fuck out
Sweat the fuck out, pass the fuck out
Black the fuck out, flip the fuck out
Drunk the fuck out, bug the fuck out

Just do what ya feel and we gon' follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Just do what ya feel and never follow
Haha, 
Methodical

Who wanna flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic, what we be smokin, Tical
The resevoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now
Man's down, hands down
Hold ground by yo' side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin bout Toni Braxton
, 
blowin her back out like Bob Backlund
I'm throwin wrestlin holds
Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot
If it don't hip it don't hop
If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life

I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual
I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters
When I slaughter don't get, caught in the water
Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare
Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities
Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggas lookin hard at me, I Port 'em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin three dimes at a time
(Redman and Method Man still... ""hiiiigh hiiiiiiiiigh"")
It's that Jersey representer
Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter
 Word...
 Just do what ya feel and never follow (repeat 3X)
Funk Doc break it down

Hah.. yo, suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze yo' camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shut your million dollar investment, to economy
And possibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin ""Caution when wet by the track wetter""
The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga  and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian
(Yo watch you say to him!)
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock Tha Bassment
You couldn't come close if I gave you my booking agent
Or producer,
 royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up - you're still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator
Fuck you, your label moms and yo' editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin
All on my shirt, the king of the flirt, shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
(Tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet)
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung (one me gun done)
Get on the mic and break em off a sumthin sumthin

We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sho' shots, it got me spittin
These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions
U-A-P ain't got no weapon, you live professin
Next in, line, 
parental discretion advised
These explicit, street linguistics
Better than yo' momma biscuits
, we bomb shellin
I might know but ain't tellin, too bad you missed it
Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Color-safe bleach so I don't fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp
Get yo' bandaids hold that
Like E said, Get the Bozack
Show them wack niggas where the do's at
On the case like I'm Kojak
Kissin the grits on that Flo bitch
Flip scripts take LOOONG shits - Raider Ruckus
One, I come with premeditated redrum

Code name beez the Soopa-Man cock my Luger
Blast your state trooper, I'm on the run G
I've got these hoes spreaded, from Japanese to diabetics
Toes stay painted because of my foot fetish
You damn right, they had to ban me from eatin pussy all night
W-W-F'n bitches
Slammin em in the rope like Shawn Mike
I can't be touched bitch, I disco in kryptonite
Shit I'm broke as hell
I had to buy all my girls fifty-fo'-eleven Reeboks at wholesale
Almost got caught boostin out of Modell's
Bitches on my coattails like they coat rails
Can't even go in a jam without a bitch grabbin my hand
And squeezin my ass sayin ""Youse the man!""
That's who the fuck I be
I got a, college degree, on bomb-zee and wreckin MC's
Makin shit happen like Lil' Cease
I come from a land of fonto leaf, bark from trees
That stick in your hand, and lakes rollin sea-weed
Criminals be up to no good
So I tuck a heater
Bulletproof suit still in the fuckin cleaners, but anyways
I bumped into my neighbor Johnny Blaze
Told me there's a bitch up the block who got more cock than AK's
The bitch just moved in, in building 210
Right next door to the Fantastic Four, and the Penguin
Good lookin Johnny, five-oh's right behind me
Let me act like I know and get ghost
Tuck in my Nina-Ross, get my cape and shades
Now I'm off with the Soopaman Three antidote

Cause I am so cool
(""When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggas hit the deck"")
Cause I am so cool

Zip my zipper down bitch and start suckin
Get your anus wet for long dick fuckin""
""Oooh, I like the way you talk, just Put It In My Mouth""
""Yeah, and I'mma keep that shit in when I'm comin""
Fucked for thirty-six minutes and twelve seconds
""Can you hit it from the back?"" oh yeah bitch no question
Turn that ass around, she had tattoos of names on her back
She said, ""I keep track""
I started readin her back I couldn't believe
I read one name it said EPMD
I turned her ass around I said no it couldn't be
It was the J-to-tha-A-to-tha-N-to-tha-E
Her pussy walls grabbed my dick so I'm stuck
So I burnt that ass from that blunt hash that I lit up
""Owwwww!!"" She jumped up, puffed up, started yellin
I smacked her, cracked her, put her in a full nelson
""Okay, okay, okay, okay, I give up
Besides Soopaman Luva, I think I hear my nigga""
Aiyyo car pulls up, he steps up *skreech* and stick his keys in

AHHHH!! Look out, it's the Funkadelic Funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is HUMMIN CUMMIN ATCHA, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture'
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the checka one, two
It's you, who? (AGA-AHHH! WWAAAAAH!) Redman with the Kung-Fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the ruffneck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label, kids
Yo E (Whassup, G?) Briiiiiidge!

""You blow my mind, baby"" ""I'll toast to that""
""You blow my mind, baby""
Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind

I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me Poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda, I'm a Star at War, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up GURRRRL
Come on and get it if you widdit, troop
Krush Groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, 'cause I'm cautious, about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real, punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean
Chu ri ka pi kyura mulla kara
Nu gu nya nada na na nun Redman
Na bo da challan nom hana do upda ...
... Nah Duke, forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind
(""REE-WIND!!"")

""You blow my mind, baby"" ""I'll toast to that""
""You blow my mind, baby""
Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind
""You blow my mind, baby"" ""I'll toast to that""
""You blow my mind, baby""

Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the
Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Loaded, of course, more Legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can 'Wax on! Wax off!' like Daniel-son
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode!

I need that sour!
Brick City let's go!

Yo Redman my nigga, who else?
A double O.G. in the game with two g's on the belt
The flows I create, it'll drown Mike Phelps
Its no sleeping here I'm anti NyQuil
Look at this nigga here, I control the stage
Boy I do it like Moses I part niggas waves
And white boys brains, they know I'm pure death on iTunes and they could choose 6 million ways
I want lazed chips, that old folks money
You know, getting paid but unemployed like Tommy
Brick city designed me, they don't wanna blame
Banana clip rounded neck that's a food chain
What up Homie, is time getting hard?
Well I'm like an alcoholic, its all about bars
My truck so big, I need a six cars garage,'
And all challengers better dodge
Hey

I got my game face on whut you know about it?
Im rolling up that Grand daddy whut you know about it?
Im driving in an exotic whut you know about it?
I pull up my car (errr) and looking at you punk like nigga whut?

Yes sir, yo I'm on a highway cruising, loving my life
That 8 0 8 like  yeah the D nice
I've seen Tina and Robin, sitting at the light
I said I beat it up I be the new Mike and Ike
Redman on blast, perfecting the craft
Smoke all ya cut, then ride off and laugh
All types of girls love Red I ain't mad
Shit I got Islamic women tryna bag dad
Yo you need crack? I move like a cartel
Even smack and B say URL
When the Wu tang sprang out of park hill
I turned up my C.R.E.A.M game getting Carvel
Yo dogs, when times getting hard
I'm like an alcoholic, it's all about bars
I'm like an AmEx card nigga, I take charge
And all challengers better dodge

Funkorama,Insomnia - The Erick Sermon Compilation Album ,1995.0,"We, hah!
This is Funk Doctor Spot!
As we look, at our clocks
We gonna take you, on a ship to another journey
To the Darkside
Hah, we've conquered, new evidence, that there is life

My funk prognosis make my brains comatose
One hundred percent funk runs bloodstreams through your nose
I don't have to be Madonna, to make your eyes freeze
Visine's for eyes when you smoke the Thai weed
For this, you need a journalist scientist
Keep your eye in this, funk cosmical, far from logical
I blow the spot up in any hood and boondox
Make the bully of the block move and get new locks
Now who kicks that phenomical, astronomical? Uhh
That's my nine in you; feelin' nauseous? That's my rhyme in you
I swing funk like nunchucks, my game's death
That's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul
Hot like Worchestire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech
My funk speech make words wear sun visors
I'm gettin' down with the funk in your trunk
Def Squad's in the house for *95* for all you punks

Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk

Ahhh, I'm just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers
Def Squad's in the house for *95* you suckers
Punks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once, twice
I'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight
The top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped
I'm off the meter
, I make computer's catch amnesia
I'm swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades
I'm Fearless like Four
 plus 
I'm Kool like Aid
My grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama
I never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters
My style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef
Def like Jam or Squad, or Def like Lep
One, two! Big up to my niggas on one-deuce
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in *blue*
Rrrrrah! With weed for you!
Who says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?
I cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up
You better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers
'Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam
When I'm loose I'm worldwide like Triple F.A.T. Goose
Heavily armed

Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk",https://genius.com/Redman-funkorama-lyrics
Smoke Buddah,Muddy Waters,1996.0,"Aiyyo, I got a slight problem I smoke weed too much
Knees buckle the -uck up when I'm splittin my dutch
Back up back up! Ain't nobody hittin for free
It's just E Doubl-E, Keith Murray, and me
It cost twenty if you're down with it
Aiyyo son I ride around with my hooptie tinted
To ride around blitted
Cause I be feenin for that pookie
I smoke the good shhh, save the backyard boogie for all groupies
And I be, smokin up the hotel lobby
Between mo' sheets than the Isleys, I'm high G
I'm holdin it down for the B-Rrrah-I-C
K, blaze, tell you to get bluhh politely
(Hit the funky if you're riding around gettin blitz)
Ask me if I love the rap game -- I, I'm loving it
Cause I can do what the OWW/-uck I feel is real
Blaze the poot with D. Don and tell UHH to get the dillz

I smoke on and on on, ya don't stop
I'm gettin mad -ucked up and ya don't stop
To all my real dogs, all my real pals
Who ain't smokin, get the -uck owwwwt

I just love tokin, blackin out like Tame in the open
Of course I got the raw dog no need to stick your nose in
Gave you a straight up shotgun when we was smokin
Froze you so fast -- you looked it like Madonna Vogue-in
AwwwwuhhhhH! I got the shhh to get your whole clique high
We can get high, but act funny and I'mma whip out
And they gon' whip out, and blow notes like Michel'le

Rated R,Whut? Thee Album,1992.0,"""I'm rated R, this is a warning""
""Boy you can't fuck with me!!""

Nah nah nah, fuck that!
Don't hold me back, the Funkadelic Devil just snapped
With a rap, that's shittin on the story of Jack Sprat
So put your money where your mouth is
Watch Redman house shit
And if it's beef, I'll punch you in your mouth, kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to Jamelle, my heart pumps nails in my blood rail
I'm not a warrior or barbarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin' about playing that nice guy role at heaven door
'Cause ever since I was an infant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she riffed-ed
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
'Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it takes just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby—fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill? That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit
What's the flavor, Tame? (Fuck what you heard, this rated R)

""I'm rated R, this is a warning""
""Boy you can't fuck with me!!""

Back to part two of the segment, the Red bend
Mics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends
And if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk
And tell the devil I'll be in time for lunch (heh heh heh heh)
Got Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P
The best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!
Psych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women
'Cause the pretty one's puss' smell like they went fishin
I grab my dick with a tight grip 'cause I might flip
(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)
I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)
Snapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it
'Cause it was August and he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)
Jason my man slangs rocks like up the block
143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop
Norman Bates work the night shift late
Since he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger
Dreamed about me havin' him scooped up
He woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate
And rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up
With the one-two punch, like serving a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk
See ya next LP, chump!

(Rock da spot)
Hah, aiyyo hah-hah
Aiyyo aiyyo, hah-hah
Nahnah, aiyyo, aiyyo

Damn, I'm the, bomb, ringing off all types alarms
My palms, be swift with the pen like Lynn Swann's
Aggravated assault, against an MC
Beat him down with the mic and all types of pedigrees
It's mad real in the Bricks, plus I roll thick
You can quote this, I'm the Moby Dick of dopeness
Bitch, walk the walk if you talk the talk
I DK New Jerz, and DK-New York
I don't push a lot of vehicles, but I push a used one
With a tape deck, if it's feasible
Tell the truth, I don't own a Lex Coupe
But I get you souped when I rock respect due
I's a nice nigga that wanna get diced
Slice the mic device like the body of Christ
Twice, E Double if you feel me hit me once
(A breaker one, a breaker two)
Cause trouble to you, family and friends
Let me cut the bullshit, just hand me yo ends
Got caught out there cause you were Mack without 10
Punch you in your chin, the rucker, bringer
Live from Hell but stay cooler than a double L
Turn a felony to a misdemeanor
Now the court subpeonaed me to get my act cleaner
Fuck that, still walk out holdin' my strap, blood, grabbing my weiner

Rock da spot
Yo

Now first of all I go for broke
Check the third quarter note, I make you feel like your water broke
Can't tell whether male or female
I fucked up your frame well, the monogram can't tell
All aboard my balls, cause my dick
Don't got a lot of room for the rest of y'all
Grab on my pubics, let my music take flight
Rock indo and out-do', dick run in and out yo'
Bitch, about nine inch up the clit
Can you feel me comin, yeah I usually make 'em shit
I shines MC's up for auction
So I can sell 'em on Saturday, Keith put the bat away
Let's lay in the cut, so we can break his whole anatomy
Down and turn into an ass-kicking holiday
Word, I rolls with the Funklord
With more flavors than them motherfuckers on them Benetton
Billboards, he's bleeding get the gauze
He shoulda' knew Def Squad crew is who I kill for
Push the clip in, slide the top back
Make sure it's off safety, in case he wanna counteract
Shit like that get me vexed
So I crack your ass like corn while your bitch crack my Beck's


Aiyyo, catch this picture, of me in the mixture
So you won't forget the black Jack the Ripper
Sorceror offin y'all with techniques
A universal lingo, with the odd speaks
Control more blacks than Harlem week
Freak, smokin that leak at full peak
Peace to Greg Street, and underground radio technique
College radio, know I mack shit like Maceo
Yeah, the East coast West coast dick giver
I oughta' be an alkie, the way I hit liver
Deliver, the milk to your door
Real raw, shit you never seen before
So when you come inside, and do the front
Watch the double-pump shotgun and please don't run
Relax your minds, let your conscience be free
And get money, and G's and roll these trees

Yo!

Hard beats like this keep my mentality raw
I G off C4 lyrics to blow off those Lex doors
My texture be the kind that explore MCs
And blow 'em out, metaphor after metaphor
I'm more wetter than your boy vigor
So how you figure you can fuck with this rap unemployed nigga?
I should own a fly bitch, house, and a Benz
But I got chickenheads, criminals, and broke friends
That love to get ends, keep the seventeens spinnin'
Pull out from my jaw linin', commence to splittin'
Brains and body parts that motion couldn't picture
'Cause when I'm shitting, niggas hit more decks than a skipper
Mr. and Mrs. Howe, Mary-Anne and Ginger
Gilligan, you need the Professor to take the rigor...
Mortis out, I got orders to kill 'em softly (Uh-huh)
I wouldn't leave a trace if I died and police chalked me
Who's the boss, G? You better radio the walkie-talkie (Ugh)
For these Fatal Attrac MC's that stalk me (Uh-huh)
Got a big dick in your bitch clit
When I flip this, I got more work than a Olympic gymnast
Bust it, I cut the mustard on any track
Milkier than Similac when I'm next up to bat

Knock a mule on her ass and turn the pussy black and blue (Haha)
You couldn't run up if your Fighter was Virtua
I'm a 'round-the-clock lyricist, I sleep in my workboots
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between the trigger and the finger of a .38
Dust by far, my rap repertoire
Be the art of murderin' makin' it hard for you to spar (Ha)
We can chill and puff the ganja, but don't be mad
When the funk Doctor Spock smoke it with your baby mama
Get off my dick and tell your bitch to come here
Male groupies gettin' shaky when I come from the rear, hah!
That get-on-your-nerve neighbor
That play the music loud as fuck three in the mornin' off a paper
With mad Zul in the L-S-C
In the downtown area, scannin' the perimeter
All my boos with the open-toed shoes
If you ain't gettin' that pussy eaten right, let me show you
Then let you taste these, this Brown Fox said

I wanna see who the fuck gettin' loud
Who the fuck runnin' off at they mouth?
I let my nigga 50 Cent knock that ass out
Word bond! Bitches talkin' bout pourin out Cristal and Dom P
They better stick to Chandon
Blackin' out wildin', smackin' out weaves
Breakin' niggas' cheap-ass chains and medallions
You're just a part-time sucker in the game
Shit is real, motherfucker, start namin' names
And if you name my name, I whoop ass like Steven Seagal
Give you Under Siege 2 without the fucking train
Let your brains hang from the 808 bang
And if I wrecked your cipher, then my Squad is to blame

Where the knotty-headed niggas and the Brick City brigade dwell
And if you don't know your fool behind better ask
Ayo-yo, you better pass that blunt
And yo E, we comin' to you live with the Cosmic type stuff

Well it's that brother coming six billion feet from beneath
And you should be peep-in how I get smoked-out on the weekend
I swing it to my crew or down to my fam
Schoolin' mellows knock is like final exams
'Cause, it's that (UH!) Funkadelic, hit you with the irrelevant
Elements, and it's coming through your blocks
Can't you smell it, trick?
Wanna copy-cat my whole format
So you get funk tracks, punchlines and skull hats
HUHHHHHHH! Got a little Redman in town
Who's that effin' clown soundin' wack with the frown??
I don't know man, but you better warn him what I would do
Wild out on his staff like birds one and two
My crew runs thicker than syrup from the barrel
You get hurt up, word up, Jam-med like Pearl
Knock off a blood clot puff on the rough block
R.I.P. my man, Rockafella, it don't stop

Droppin' the flavor, stay Sky high like Pager
I'm magical like Fantasia on paper
I Saw the Light like Kraftwerk, of course
When the T-L-A Rock shock the stuff, It's Yours!
In your drawers! Your record label got your staff gassed
Thinkin' you gonna sell two mil cakes real fast
But you flopped, and your image choked like a TEC
Now, who freakin' style your ass gonna steal next?
Are there any more imitators in the house?
 There are no
Bust like NBA Jams, and you can have Chicago
Catch the combo, funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back, when I pumped 92 KTU in Harlem
Huuhhh! I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna *sniff sound* my style like a junkie on crack
Trick, you better back the freak up, for real now

Motherfucking
Ladies and gentleman, my style's rugged like Timberland
When I clock dividends women give me more love than Wimbledon, uh
My style flow local like New Jersey transit
And I can't stand it, and you'll need 
Teddy to unjam it when I cram it
I'm from, N to the E, W-A-R-K
Newark NJ got the AK, when I wave bitch you better say ""Heey!""
I'm a Kid From the Hall
I got big balls to make your pussy walls drip in your lace drawers
Hey boy this is the way the East Coast swing it so bring it
Man, I turn your ass Brown-er than James with the Sex Machine shit
I keep the chronic patrol on the road
In case you're wondering why I keep mad izm
'Cause I smoke everybody else's shit up
My style's the ultimate funk when I mic checka, one two checka
And I give effects to niggas with my Black and Decker, so check
The manuscript, man you flipped, put it down if you can't handle it
Got a B.R.C.G., Blunt Rollers College Graduate
I got a degrees in Physics on how high I can get
Then next I check how many niggas that can die from my TEC
Cause the N-E-W-A-R-K
Is where the niggas robbin' and stealin' and buckin' niggas every day
Now Jersey's on max so pass the dutchie on the left hand side
Got the hidash, in case we cridash, in my ride
So
, sliiiide, before I call the medics
You can bet, bitch, you couldn't get fly if you was FedEx
Can I, drop the funk on ya, run it on ya?
Strong as ammonia, smell it from here to California
'Cause Reggie Noble dropped that cock named Noble at Sunoco
I'm better than rice and beans when I rock you ocho to ocho
My music more underground than a kid at 300 XL
Convertible, fuel-injected, that's why my style's well-respected
I'm dope on the ridealz, so fidealz, on my didealz
And chumps are wondering what two niggas dropped the funk, funk!

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)
Who is them niggas, who is them niggas
Who is dem niggas Redman and Reggie Noble
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)
Who is them niggas, who is them niggas
Reggie Noble, drop the funk one time

Verbally you never heard of me, I smoke you third degrees
And 'cause surgery for emergency 'cause Reggie Noble known like burglary
I get hot busted when I dip my nuggets (Hey)
'Cause it take a million niggas to stop it just like Chuck did
'Cause we run around Newark with the nine on cock
Keep it heated for the brothers that's not off my block
And if ya don't know the flavor, be a tough guy and enter
So go show you more nigga events than Jacob Javits center
I'm genuine, to the rhyme, get your canines
Cops, I got the hot Glock stocked for when it's playtime
I rock around the Robin tweet tweet on the calendar
'Cause you couldn't pull my number if your class major was Algebra
I make bitches moan to my Stallone without Sylvester
'Cause I'm more deadlier than a whole school system of asbestos
So check us, I always smoke mad blunts before breakfast
'Cause I, Get Around like 2Pac with Poetic in my Justice
Hold tight, hold tight, everybody hold tight
I'm Super like my man Cat, 'cause I keep my styles jam packed
I (wreawow) like Anthrax, split my pants like Bill Bixby
You could tell the tracks was fat from the work of my MP-60
I smoke the chronic that's why my sinus always fucked up
(Cam-boo, cam-boo cam-boo) Will have you fucked up
I blaze blunts with my nigga Mel-low, yo, say hello
(Yo, what up dog?)
Really, now pass the second blunt to Quilly

Now sit your big ass down 'cause I don't know about this rap stuff
There wasn't rap when I was pickin' cotton, saying 'massa'
Y'all young whippersnappers, with the caps on backwards
Man, y'all fuck around with Quilly I kick a bone out yo' ass quick
(Watch out now) I ain't bullshittin'
I represent the O-O-O-O-OG's from '43 goddamnit
And if you keep on with that dirty mistreating
I'm gon' whoop your ass 'til your heart stop beating goddamnit

Ayo, chronic bubonic, the funky bionic you find it I'll have to rewind it
Where minds are blinded, ""Time 4 Sum Aksion"", so time to find it
I'm smoked out like a cookout, ah, look out, my dick's out
That was last album when I was bouncing on trains like Malcolm
I was hiiiiigh, I thought I wouldn't survive
That's why I quit my nine to five and got live
Because this ""hip to the hop"" shit fills my pockets
And I'm Audi for '94 because I already got my props
Hoes, hoes, and more hoes...

(uh-huh uh-huh, check it out, check it out)
Funky Noble Productions represent for the nine-four and nine-five area
Reggie Noble and Rockwilder in the house for the nizzow
If you don't know you might as well close your mizzouth
(To my peeps in Queens)
Yeah, ohh shit, yo, it's a bird
(Nah I thought that shit was a fuckin plane dude)
Nah nah nah, it's Soop, Soop, Soop-a-man
Hah
Verse One: Redman
Well it's the Soopaman Lovah in your motherfuckin town
Get down go round and round like shocks on your G-spot
Honeydip, now all of y'all up in that funny shit
But I ain't switched, still a honeydip is a honeybitch
In the mix! So bitches be lookin fly and I'll run in em
With they toes and nails done, hair wrapped up with pins in em
Fifty-four eleven Reeboks bitch which you need not
To do is get fly, cause where I'm from, bitches get speed knots
Slow your monkey ass down and hold your horses
Don't wanna know your name don't wanna know none of your sources
Just fix me, with a quickie, I swear more Lake's than Ricki
So bad I use my X-Ray vision to give y'all clits a hickie
And plus the weed I puff is from the planet of Cheech and Chong
Where the earth is chronic, and How To Roll a Blunt is the theme song
Oooh you makin me horny! Well uhh, let me wipe that wetness for ya
Slurped and burped, got that bitch more open than my door do
Let's take a journey up in the stars where I live at
Where I fuck Jane, Judy Jetson, and that robot bitch-ah
Grab onto the cape and uhh... I said before I took her
Don't choke me! And it's up up and away I took the hooker
And it's on
Verse Two: Redman
We landed on my planet, we smoked out like a fuck up
Bought a dime from Jabba the Hut and some uncut for the hooker
She said, ""I don't sniff blow I just smoke weed to get me horny
So I'm nothin like that bitch in your last Soopaman Lovah story.""
You go girl! But I didn't believe her, had to make sure
Where you from, the projects? ""Yeahhhh, but I'm single
You needed a quickie and I'm just that bitch to break you off, shit
My pussy's so good, it tickle my legs when I walk!""
Oh really, just show me a couple of ways how you'll thrill me
She lifted up her dress and the whole area got chilly
""So what you think of that?"" I threw that bitch back on my back
Shit I live ten miles away, but I made it fo' seconds flat
I lived in the same building with Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk
Got R2-D2 and Mork from Ork puttin in work
See I got the block sewn ""Oooh baby let's get it on!""
About time, I opened the door she had her ass and tits showin
She rushed me to the room and stripped me out of my attire
She tied me to the bedposts then she lit the room on fire
She took out a scarf wrapped it around my eyes till I was blind
But with my X-Ray vision I saw the icepick from behind
So I broke out the ropes, smacked the ho, then suplexed her
She pulled out a Tec and wet my chest with the S was
""Oh shit I'm shot!"" There was blood all over my finger!
I think I left my other bulletproof suit in the cleaner
She gave a whistle, they came in crews, word is bond
It was a bunch of Martian bitches with bodysuits and Platforms
""Damn, I gotta think of a plan, whatamIdo?
Did Superman have a gun?"" Nah, but the Soopaman Lovah do!
So I pulled out the fo'-fifth, left the bitches open
Had another clip in case some mo' bitches want mo' shit
And I saw that trick Bewitched flying on her broomstick
Pa-dow! Shot her down because I leave no witness
Job well done I cleaned myself in a hurry

For MC derelict whippin', cap or cock twistin'
Drop your money in the slot if your block don't got
A real representer cocked for action like my block got
Rhyme skills three and a quarter for them drop tops
Your caliber, straight up pussy who pop Glocks
While I kick facts react on funky tracks
Give me room like the Hyatt while I run this jungle habitat
And if I snap, get that monkey off my back
Me and mic's together roll tighter than Slick and Vance Wright
Toast to the real MC's that can feel me
And if your bitch ain't jumpin' now then later on she will be
All these weak punk MC's kill me
They don't thrill me, come to Jerz and get Jacked like Jill, G

Spittin that Newcleus I suggest you Jams On It
I'm not a role model I cracks the Beck's bottle
Smoke blunts, play pretty MC's as sex models
So inhale exhale what you smell?
Derail the frail blind MC off my trail
If he use braille, see I never been touched
Regulate the street tactics then parlay in the cut
Uhhahhh, lay back and hit this while I shit this
Flip this, schizo ass flow at long distance
And plus I pack nine inches in my britches
And keep an instant lit for the funky ass bitches
Newark, New Jersey's on the map, ?comprende?
And confrontations start from the blunts and the Reme
And if an-y, MC out there wanna test
Call my boy Poppa C to put a slug in your vest

Then outlast, a few clowns, sounds
Raps, stay bein the mack like Dru Down
Ask me what I smoke and I say, 
""It's the method!""
Funk off the hook I leave shit disconnected!
What's the name of that town rollin up trees?
Jersey smokin up the bom ba zee!
It don't stop, you better move slowly
I make that chest wet and cosy
Then dip lowkey like OG's
Then inject that antidote to make you OD
You know a better flower get the dough G and show me
I bet you I make em more 
pussy than Josie

And show em How High I am just from the nosebleed (How High)

Kick that rugged shit that Maybelline couldn't make-up, lace up

Chill and relax, I'm back in effect
Yes, I'm Erick Sermon, with a brand new cassette
Yes, I'm spoiled, rich like topsoil
Still loyal, still the MC Grand Royal
I'm still dope, I'm still no joke
I don't care, I'm still wild like Tone Loc
I'm swift, a.k.a. a black stallion
Fat herringbone, with no medallion
Hello, I still got the same funk flow and yo
I still get busy like Arsenio
When I rock, I need all the girls with me
So I can be their baby tonight, like Whitney
Houston, producing a style that make a smile
To make you say, ""Ooooohh chilllld!""
Bust the steps, the picture, frame it
Hall of fame it, hang it, so no one can claim it
I rule, brung my style from the Boondox
Now my shit pump in the boombox
Yo Red, my ears are ringin'
I can hear some girl singin'
*sings* Heyyyyy, Erick Serrrmon! Heyyyayyyy!
Uhh, rock the mic honey I love the way you sway
Plus, I crush that drive me crazy
I replied, hmm... (slow down, baby, uh)
I'm ill, smooth as Johnny Gill
Gill, my my my, I pack steel
So back off, softy, here's an ice cream cone
Put down the microphone
Thank you, right about now I'm through
I'm ghost like Casper...see you!

""When I come around, homeboy, watch yo nuggets""

Funky fresh in the flesh, the Sooperman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this, Redman is milk like two tits
I stay, freshly dipped with the nine
And a clip on my hip, money-grip, no bullshit
I tic-tac on small cracks I'm all that to fall black
My jaw snap with raps, so umm, get the balls, Jack
Flavor like Flav, plus I'm well paid
Own a maid with a blade, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkle like Colgate
My dick's named Machete, I stab much ho-cake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix
Jammm, OOPS! I turn up the pitch
To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, yeahhh, I'm feelin kinda so-so
I dog you like Toto, make Rudolph nose glow
Funk out of sight with the type of hype
To make you say, umm, a 'Dyn-o-mite!'
Chiller, chiller than the Ice on Vanilla
I kill more kills than the quils from Tequila
I'm down with the green-eyed brother named Erick
Charlie, how you rate this? (Hmm, ten like Bo Derek)
I'm deeper than a valley, peace to Cool V and Sally

It's that nigga who's so swift I could lose a compass
Step into jams, with seven niggas in a Land
And forty motherfuckers in some fucked up caravan
Drop the Fahrenheit back down to zero

Got that lyrical chicken feed, for all chicken heads
Crowd your Rap City committee like I'm Big Lez
More sicker than them Menendez brothers
You need Cochran when you're fuckin with Judge Dredd
Put your fingers up if you love hash and cash
I been that way since Ike Turner was kickin Tina ass
Hookers ridin dick, like I'm a motorcycle
You wanna shine bitch? Let me Simoniz you
I make sure your vision blur, till you don't know what occurred
Until I black out every nerve
Foul women get served as chicken head hors d'ouerves
I drop your tops like your heads was convertibles!!
Hah, if you still look up in the sky I'm still high
All the way live like Lakeside
Wann die? E (whattup son), you got this beat bumpin'
The way I feel niggas ain't leave until they up in somethin'
Pack my dutch like the niggas in the county

For your little daughter like I'm Cutty
Twenty dollars a pop to dub me, I bug G, quote it

Nineteen ninety-six
(hah, come on!) Coming with the sickedest motherfuckers
In the perimeter
(huh, whooo! nineteen) You hit em with a newwwww
(ninety-six, nine six) tree, dick be fly, in your ass
(Dick! Di-dick, check)

Amazing grace how sweet the sound is of the fo' pound
To blast all these sound men that got the po' sound
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers here's the show down
But since we're broke now with dope sounds now here we go now
Check the motion while I be puffin the potent
Blow spots and urban networks with other experts
Plus this thing between my ear thinks clear
And the only thing it fears is the man upstairs
So fuck your bulletproof gear
If I decide to get your ass you better believe it's more than a blast
(boo-ya) More like rough paragraphs out Alcatraz
And ash, your staff, let the grime our your ass
Everybody's hustling with sons toting guns
Where Reggie Noble's from we stick nuns that got funds
Bomb niggas like they did in Oklahoma
Freez, you're froze, Def Squad UHH, case closed

I be the, sneaky, second dimension, seeping through your sector
Have nectar, leaking out you wack rhyme stressers
Extra deez disease leave rashes on rappers
Makin MC's so feel the breeze of the Grandmaster
Packed with swift solid style structure
Simonizing MC's with the degree of street ruckus
Aiyyo who got guns? I split precise, spleen splitter
Return my physical presence to the borough of the hard hitters
I devour, night sun shower, minutes last hour, weak man's last power
Body, the six four mind shotty
The one you handle, second dimension mind vandal
Lacerating your retina for tryin to see this
As I'm flowin through the prism of the X-3-D
See at forty belows I freak flows that burn your nose
When you inhale the verbal blows, case closed

Aiyyo, why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga?
(Aiyyo, why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga?)
Yo, don't you know, who I am motherfucker?
Redman's the name fool
(That's my nigga!)
Why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga?
(Aiyyo, why the fuck you tryin to get funky on me nigga?)
Yo, don't you know, who they are motherfucker?
(Crossbreed's the crew fool)
Them my niggas!

Things ain't easy, cuz we be, strugglin day to day
A bunch of stressed black men with not really much to say
Twistin up some brown paper that we struggle just to get
All the deaf dumb and blind become mentally equipped
As I extend my pen to wreak havoc on paper
I execute and burn MC's like Absolut with no chaser
Strong as chemical the general with props
Past wreckin mics, I make the Earth shatter like the 7th sign
My drama bring about a new aura
I'm sending a plague through your town like God did Sodom and Gomorrah
The deepest, my vocals actions got you speechless
Make gangsta niggas wanna go home and talk to Jesus
No man alive could figure we, beating rappers literally
X-3-D get up on this three dimensional trilogy
Got no love for foes, no respect for grimy hoes
Nuff said, X-3-D blowing up, case closed",https://genius.com/Redman-case-closed-lyrics
Bobyahed2dis,Dare Iz a Darkside,1994.0,"Ahhhhhh...
You are now about to enter the psychotic mind of Redman
Let's take a journey on a funk cosmic adventure
To where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered
Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics
From a place we call hell, and beyond...

And I say... right about now you are rockin with the best!
Can I get a hit? *inhale* *coughing* Thank you *coughing*
What you're about to experience is a walk on the Funkadelic side
Who knows better than the Funkadelic devil himself
To all knotty head niggas, bob to this
Come walk with Def Squad on the darkside
Coming to you live and direct without further adieu
I bring to you Redman one more time
This is Jeff Stewart and you know how I do it... god DAYAM!!!

So who's that funky nigga that's known to kick the fat shit?
The mirror said ""You are, you conceited bastard""
*cutting and scratching of bastard*
Done by the dogcatcher, dogcatcher, it's the dogfetcher, I betcha
Aahhhhhhhhhhh, with the slang
Get you coughed up from the weed it'll bust your brain
The top notch of hip-hop and I'm on the charts
I'm catching applause when I rock the microphone from the heart
My style's foul, so look into the eyes of 
Lorimars
As you can see, I drop funk bars from here to Mars
Still rollin down the highway wit my forty between my lap bitch
Crossin DTW, coming into Manhattan
Boy my skills are stacks, I love to do it from the back
My style swarms over ghettoes like crack
Go in any hood and puff a blunt with any nigga
As long as we both got, it don't matter who's gun bigger
But I bet you you can't do that, cause the multiplatinums
Can't save your ass on the block, and you're fucked if it ain't pop
The funk is blowin wattage out your fuckin trunks
Like Pete Puma, I known to give a whole lots of lumps
Props I got, coming through your block nine cocked
My socks, even got three-eighty-nine shots
Don't press it, I hang em like them niggas do in Texas
You don't have no heart you chestless, cuz your heart's on my necklace
I give props to real MC's like KRS-One
Kool G Rap,
 Buckshot, Busta me and I'm from
The East coast!! Where a nigga like you'd get laughed at
And since you came out gassed, well I'm closin your gas cap
The creature, from the deeper, ultimate funk freaker
Represent New Jersey, keep your eyes up on the Preacher
A menace like Dennis
, 
I got game like Ennis
I can french-kiss my lyrics, then I run trains with sentence
Lord have mercy! It's too much funk to cope with
Droppin dope shit after dope shit, we're atrocious
That's from the lungs, that rings from here to kingdom come
And I don't have to be a Special Ed to get dumb!!
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ
(From Newark New Jersey, in the place to be)
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ
(Because I can jam like Teddy if you let me)

A Day of Sooperman Lover,Whut? Thee Album,1992.0,"-Look! Up in the sky!
-It's a bird...
-It's a plane!
-Hee hee hee hee, no! It's Sooperman Lover, baby! Yeah
-Daddy, Daddy! Would you please tell me a story?
-Alright, get over here and sit yo' big ass down
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...

Ayo, I was out to lunch and shit, puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked
Boogie'n to my Walkman with an ""S"" on my chest
(Bust a move!) Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway, let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am, so git off that ol' bull-
Shucks! Lunchtime was up—FUCK!
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:
""If found, please return to this address""
(How did you see it?) Nigga, with my X-ray eye set!
Like ""Pchoooooooww"", I jetted to the closest phone-booth
Quick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...
(Johnny 'Guitar' Watson: I can leap tall buildings...yeah...
In a single bound...)
Boom! Right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling
(It's a, it's a plane!) Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains
On a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'
He was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n
Relaxin', feet cocked up, just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'
Then landed at the cat's tag address in the projects
(Elevator's broken!) So I had to take the back steps
(Knock, Knock) The door opened then my eyes swole
From this badass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold
""Yo, is this your cat?"" ""Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?""
""He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan""
""Well, how the hell did you save him? Are you police undercover?""
""Naw baby the ""S"" on my chest stands for""

Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong...
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...

She was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me
No money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?
""Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?""
""Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka""
We sat, unhooked the cape from my back
She felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked
""Goddamn, Sooperlover! Yo shit look thick
Tell me, how strong are you with muscles like this?
You bad motherfucker!"" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)
Akhi hit ya like Rocky
She dashed to the room and came back with an ounce
Negligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up, hey hold up, she had the dollar fold up
To mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff, some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick
And said: ""Here baby, hit it."" ""Naw baby, I ain't wit' it
You'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit!""
But I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull, it was hype, oughta sight
She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the cover and, oh brother, I was wit' it
Ready to hit it asked my dick (Yo, wassup, G?)
Yo, man, shit's thick
Licked her on her belly then kissed her down her back
Stuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack
As big as mine (Ewwww!) This bitch must be craze
So I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...
'Cause I'm the

Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong...
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...",https://genius.com/Redman-a-day-of-sooperman-lover-lyrics

It's a slaughter if you order the hit without the water
And if swallowed without the damn water to follow
You might be doin' a stupid dance and win a grand at the Apollo
I'm rough, snap necks, drink Olde E, but crack Beck's
Wreck anything that's wet, when I have sex
For instance, I mix with, a style that make you shit bricks
Tsk tsk, I'm musically gifted, terrific
Boom-shaka-lak, Red got crazy knots
And knots in the pots, got props from here to George Washington Bridge

So Ruff,Whut? Thee Album,1992.0,"Ahh Redman..
Do you feel that the Blacks in your community
Are still mad at the racial situation?
Yeah, they still mad
And if you don't take that funny smirk off your face
I'mma kick your...
Over three hundred ghetto-related crimes happened
In Newark, New Jersey alone — still the saga continues

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up! I got the jammy to your guts, punk
Don't make a move! Before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block, 'cause my stomach's in a knot
And it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock
I got roaches and rats up the back, carryin' bats and gats
So I *farting noise* 'fore I snack, Jack
I guzzle it down with water from the hydrant
My moms taking a bath and my brother's next to dive in
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squad up, 'cause I'ma set up this kid
Carryin' loot out from Burger King and what I'ma do is...
Run up on him, snatch the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
'Cause, my man, when I think of a plan, there's no shorts take
'Cause I pack jammies inside of my North Face, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am 'cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo, my man you got a light? 
Yeah, give me the effin' money too, G!)
Yo, STOP, STOP, STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well, so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag, it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
'Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
But they carryin' black Glocks (Shit's thick!)
What's my next move? My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on, once again it's on
I fell (OW!) and then the black Glocks went (POW!)
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing I'm sniffin' is dust, because it's...

'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough

Me and Erick Sermon taking a trip Uptown
In the 4Runner, blastin' my tape, puffin' ganja
Since Erick got props
I stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin' me
So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin' she was scopin' me 'cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week, honeydip freaked the funk
Playin' Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin' him weekdays, callin' me weeknights
(Who had her weekends?) Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
(No hats? Damn, black) The Funkadelic
Took a splash — you know how that go, fellas
Two months later (See you later, alligator)
She was pissed and I ended up seein' my physician
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin', ""Why the hell he isn't dead yet?""
Then I asked her, ""Why you lookin' at me?!""
She said, ""Redman, because you have the HIV""
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!
Too late, 'cause Erick already had his drawers down
'Cause it's

'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough

To all my brothers, wear your hats, wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters, make 'em wear they prophyl-lastic
'Cause it's drastic, havin' another ghetto bastard
Think I'm dying for a piece of butt? Honey, you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss, so pucker up
'Cause you end up messin' around catchin' the heebie jeebies
Lookin' like ""WHODUNNIT?"" Witcha face up on the TV
So next time you want sex, get wreck, but protect
'Cause you could be like sexin' to your last death
And if you still don't know the time, press rewind
'Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline

You heard it comin' from the lungs of the Funkadelic brother himself
More funk than a bag of skunk
Twice the funk than James Brown's socks
Hit me
Hittin' you straight across your mouth
Wit a tune
Yo, Redman, drop it

Make my funk the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up

Make my funk the P-Funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce brains, make emcees jump
Sky high
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-tens
Not from an oven, but MAC-10
A MAC-20 maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black man's culture
Want more? Buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E-Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P-Funk

Make my funk the P-Funk
I want my funk uncut (Make mine the P)
Make my funk the P-Funk (Wants to get funked up)
I wants to get funked up

I'm back with the funk, chump
You want funk? How many lumps?

I go to the store they try to pop my fan-belt
Then I body 'em in the street like Cornbread Earl
Boy I'm that thorough, I'm like a pitbull
Windex in the pen to make it crystal
170 but in rap I'm a big dude
So yeah, I got bars like a Gym Room
Boy I'm that dirty
So tell the rap Jury
That tennis, The only way a nigga gon' serve me
My black Mac Bernie, 
I even mat suri
Shit I'm killin' the Mic Like Conrad Murray
Get ya weight up boy, you wan' hustle with it
Even my protein bars got muscle in it
Pop my trunk, Pop Yours nothin' in it

Send him down to unemployment cause homey gone get this work (rite)
Hot Benz, every honey is top ten
If she Hops in, then mo' than likely we not friends
Look I'm locked in, Hit you like Skelly, your top spin
First I pop, then I'm out like Pirelli's on stock rims
Flyest in the game, still applyin' the pain
Since Milk was Top Billin', and Lyte was ridin' the train
These paper thin villains get scraped and thrown in the flame
85% of rappers is fake and so is they chain
Now that's a no-brainer
36 in my Chamber
Now a moment of silence I throw a L up for Banga
Lyricist not a Singa
Don't ever forget its Gangsta

Sorry if I left somebody leavin out with stitches
Seems y'all too grown for ya britches
Enslaved your mind like cotton pickers for runnin wit some rotten niggas
I get raw to the core with hardcore metaphors
Resevoir Dog style, truly yours
Yes, I be the slug up in your chest
Then you wonder why you can't feel the full strength of cigarettes
My nationality is brutality
I got the gun up under your leather nigga so walk casually
You'd be surprised how much info you can get
For a bottle of crack to find yo' punk ass and yo' kinfolks
Plus, that crew you run with is butt
I was dusted one day when I made your man choke up
Rappers comin to New Jersey and be gettin fucked up
Talkin about where they from and shit when dem sons ain't runnin shit
And god forbid you do a show in da Bricks
You'd swear you was flying how we bring so much turbulence
I keep your nervous level high nigga
You better kiss your son and daughter, tell em bye nigga
When we creep

Shinin baguettes, flashin cash and dumpin Moets
Especially when my royalty check is late, I don't hesitate
I scoop up Keith, and see who's flashin at the Palla-

Lookin bummy for low profile, so loud MC's overlook me
I slip the bartender some raw
Just to tell me how much cash and Dom P you pour
Huh, I should start robbin rappers in the industry
If we ain't clickin then I'm engineerin your injuries
Forty-eight tracks of automatic and mac's
Lyrically splat-datted till your mentality blacks
And I don't give a fuck if you did thirty bids
Still I bring you Ecstasy like I'm the rapper Jalil
Blaow blaow blaow, lickin shots for your fuckin
Mind, I got you niggas duckin out like I'm one-time
Or five-oh, po-po, I drive hoes nutty
Like I be doin security at my live shows

Bitches fuck me barely walkin out
For a thievin ass ho fo' mark it out
It's one mo' body in the hall for now
Verbal assault killer, calm him down
I open fire, made you retire
Hung your shoes from a telephone wire
So when I ride by, I brag on it
Paragraphs fly wit toe tags on it
I plant a bomb where you pick your mail up
It's BRICKS, so y'all hit the fallout shelter
Doc, niggas, bitches, jump up
Criminals, hustlers, hoes, jump up

It’s Like That (My Big Brother),Muddy Waters,1996.0,"Due to technical difficulties beyond our control
Reggie Noble's stinkin ass will not be performing with us tonight
: Erick Sermon, keep keep it on
Def Squad, Erick Sermon, Redman keep keep it on
K to M Keith Murray keep keep it on
Keep keep on, ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
Keep keep it on, and ya don't stop
K-Solo, Redman, ya don't stop
Erick Sermon, Keith Murray ya don't stop

I X'd ya amateur, damage ya, have fools jumpin off
Cliffs grabbin their ass cheeks yellin Geronimo
It ain't a problem at all we can't solve
Three-hundred and sixty degrees rhymes or boulevards
Are charged, by my entourage, who put the Ram in Dodge
Ras cla in bumba claat
Maintain, few remain in the game
So I remain focused and pop's the main aim

Well it's the Funk Doctor Spot, the pon cock lyricist
My mentality's so def yo I ain't even hearin this shit
Biscuits be cockin back when I be coming
I guess they heard how I be takin MC's out by the hundreds
Wanted, for two million and a body alone
And use the microphone as my accomplice
Scientist still trippin, thinkin
What the fuck is this funky fungus that growed amongst us

Sprayed a few, shank a few, rap crews say they shamed too
But can't hang two, like we do
Fuck them, they better bow slow
This rhyme'll cold hit em, real quick cause I'm K-Solo
Battle any dude, this retifuge I'm in cruise
See what the better vet, could do, to you undouche
You three groups, four punkses at a time
I box two and knock em out at the drop of a dime

The long faced murderer
Servin over two billion motherfuckers a day like Mickey D's circular
Workin' a shifty hour like a burglar
My crew herbin ya like we never even heard of ya
Odds are evens, that I'mma be the one creepin
My new niggas check the flows of the major deacon
The bizarre, the rap non-superstar
When I step up, I pump volume like Ra'

My afro blows in three-hundred sixty degrees
So this makes me, the light skinned Richard Roundtree
Vocabulary's very, loquacious, and gregarious
Pump that too, go grab the dictionary
Fly word that we flip on the M-I-K-E mike
My crew be like, this style's hype
Wrong's the opposite forget the bullshhhh
To rhyme like the K-Solo, you need more than a soul kit

Come closer, while I lock it down like I'm supposed ta
You battle me, you won? You might of, but then you woke up
My turbulence will make peanut butter choke up
Call me tha Brick City, Stock Cock Broker
Y'all niggas is fools, playin with hood moves
You couldn't total my amount if you sung I Missed You
Dissed you dismissed you yeah I fixed you
Let your girl suck on the shit that I piss through

Cosmic Slop,Dare Iz a Darkside,1994.0,"Yeah, bout to fly that knot
Redman, Keith Murray, Erick Sermon with the, Cosmic Slop
And we all pack Glocks
Word is Bond, word is bond
Fuck around and get shot

As I flip, skip to the beat, on wax, and tax
I react with tons of macs, a ball, and some jumping jacks
Flyin expert, puttin in work
No question, cosmic funk and weed session
Like GangStarr, step up, it's Hard to Earn
But I change up the mode, and blow up the globe
The bandit, spittin dialect umm (UMMM)
Catchin wreck umm (UMMM)
One two micraphone check (UMMM)
Attention passenger's we're on a non-central journey
To Hell and beyond
FUNKADELIC DROP THE BOMB!!

Boo-yaa!
I'm that type of nigga to give it to ya
My Cosmic Slop rules all blocks with funk maneuvers
My flow freeze the Nile, The Funk Child splits the river
Then I crush, like the bom-ba-zee was rushed, through my verbal lust
I'm spaced out, I LOST MY MIND ON CLOUD 19
VISINE FOR EYES, when I blow Alpines
Dial 9, 0-0, For the hero of the wierdos
I hope my brain don't bust
Transform into a 7-11 Slurpie Slush
IT'S THE FLY, My music will burn eyes
Twice the chemical of Clorox
Then I do an autopse on four cops
When my jaws drop, ock, I fidget my nuts alot
Got the two Glocks, with oowops then bodies trace the chalk
I'm like an eclipse on a Friday, the 13th
With black cats and Haley's Comet, blazin blunts in my driveway
Nostradamus predicted, for you funk fiends
That Def Squad will get the fuckin cream like Noxzema
For those that remember pics and afros (it's on like that)
Platform shoes and bell-bottoms some got em
Spaced out, way out, is what I'm talkin about
In the Cosmic Slop of the Ghetto
Zuzuzuzuzu, zuzuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu
Zu zuzu, zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu zuzu

With amazing manifestations, I dictate to nations
More Cosmic Funk innovations in my creation
This Cosmic sick mic cylcicyst
Mega segments, be Sega, like Genesis
I orbits the solar system, listenin
Guzzlin, never sippin, or slippin and sympin when the track is rippin
I gotcha brain cells bendin and twistin
Man listen, I give your whole crew an acid drenching
Just for mentionin, goin that route, runnin yo mouth
You get your head smacked off towards down South
And your crew too will be spaced out
Way out, no doubt, y'all niggas need to stop
And get with this Cosmic Slop

A Million and 1 Buddah Spots,Dare Iz a Darkside,1994.0,"Still walking down the streets with my hand on my black Tec
My brain is high like Newark New Jersey do car thefts
I'm high, when I sag my 2 Black Guys
I would be brief but my Karl Kani's didn't dry
I smoke the blunt for all you underground chumps
My smoke bangs like it's freshly picked from the swamps
So nigga how you roll a blunt, how you roll a blunt
Flip the script on some other shit like how you roll a cunt
Now, I smoke the Maui, wow-wee
Then I'll be back for more, I'm sure, like Al B
Go Uptown, smoke quarter-pounds at the Dungeon
Keith Murray meets me at the spot with the Bom-Ba
Go back to Jerz and smoke with Diezel Don
Huh, pick up a bag from my block, two-oh's the number
Who can get swift with the microphonics
Plus I'm crisp like CD's on LP's in 3D
My funk respect it, cosmic injected
That cause me to set it off just like that club record
Hit it from the back, stay strapped like two packs of lubricants
It's gonna hurt, no it's not I got experience
The funk dweller, creeps through your cellar
And if your moms don't know your ass better tell her, like this y'all

There's a million and one blunt spots all over the world
That got the good herb for all you boys and girls
Which one do you go to?
Which one do you go to?
I'm packing buddha by the pounds and pull my Phillies from knapsacks
Hey bro I didn't know your nickel bags come that fat
Yo check it, my lyrics strip the track butt-naked
Catch the local to the A to the buddha to my vocals
And I, set the world on fire
Get a billion people higher, from just one blunt in my cypher
You swore to God you was mixed in bom-ba-zee
The rhymer bomb squads and MC's like Hank Shocklee
I spend a knot at all the buddha spots
From fifteen to fifty-fifth I ran all through the blocks
I set it off jock, I light a blunt for my nigga D
That's doing three flat, now where I get the hash at
You can't fuck with my funk cause my funk is kinda abstract
Past that, my stuff, I'm rough like McGruff on dust
There's a million and one blunt spots in America
Yeah I'm tellin ya

Now just throw your blunts up in the motherfucking air
Smoked out with niggas from North Newark to Montclair
I rip the nouns from antonyms to synonyms
Cause I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and them
One of the America's Most Blunted
Smoked out with MC Eiht and Compton Most Wanted
Ninety degrees, smoke with L.O.D. on the Island
Then back to Stat, to smoke more packs with the Shaolin
I showed the women how to roll a blunt stronger
But it didn't work because they Lee nails got longer
But the weed is good for when you're macking
And girls can front it off like they don't know shit that happened
I know what happened, I told her back, nick that motherfucker
So check my stamina, your ass couldn't snap with cameras
Leave you on your back like Godzilla did Gamera
Props on blocks smoking the choc and what-nots
I might catch a nickel bag sale from bus stops",https://genius.com/Redman-a-million-and-1-buddah-spots-lyrics

Big ups to them Detroit niggas: D12, Eminem (Get high, mayne)
Royce Da 5'9"", Trick Trick, and them goons
This goes out to Proof, baaabbbby

Yo, Reg Noble, roll up in the blue Volvo
I rock Polo, my face like Miguel Cotto
I'm serious, pour the cranberry with the Remy
Impersonate you rappers more than Milli Vanilli
I'm higher than the drug dealer you got your weed from
You rappers won't impress me 'til you learn to make an album
So quit it, fall back, 'cause I got the power
It's music, money, hoes, plus blunts of the sour
My name is Reggie Noble, I'm a sexaholic (Hi, Reggie)
I fucked my babysitter on my mama toilet
I'm a Kon Artist, like the homie from D12
Niggas think I ain't strapped until they hear the shells
Bitch, I'm coming out shootin' through the window, in the car chase
You gettin' shot the fuck up like Scarface
I started rolling blunts, my mind is getting open
My pen is like Cheech and Chong, I'm still smoking

Yo, so when you see me in your city high as hell
And I'm dancing like Diddy — I just don't give a fuck
Smoking the sour in the drop
With the homie and he holding on the Glock sayin'
I just don't give a fuck
So if you don't follow me on the Twitter
I ain't bitter, fuck you niggas — I just don't give a fuck
When you see me on the streets, run
'Cause most likely Red got a gun — I just don't give a fuck

Yo, I'm poppin' the E, but I'm looking for MDMA
With a double barrel, bumpin' NWA
I hustle hard for the guap around any season
That's why my rims beaming where the parking meter reading
Beefin', you're all Vegan, you wouldn't beat a case
You're the type to snitch the first hour, First 48
Never needed a cape, I'm a lyrical hero
Doctor, the Psycho ward gave me a referral
When I form like Wu-Tang in the street with the heat of DeNiro
Redman's the coolest, Reggie Noble's a weirdo
Sativa, with your wife eating the beaver
Skeet on her lips looking like Missy Misdemeanor
The dirtiest rhymer, marijuana addict
The legend, icon, gorilla, classic
Half alien, half bro, I'm the type of asshole
To cut your girl's fake breast with a knife as big as Rambo's

So when you see me in your city high as hell
And I'm dancing like Diddy — I just don't give a fuck
Smoking the sour in the drop
With the homie and he holding on the Glock sayin'
I just don't give a fuck
So if you don't follow me on the Twitter
I ain't bitter, fuck you niggas — I just don't give a fuck
When you see me on the streets, run
'Cause most likely Red got a gun — I just don't give a fuck

Inhale like asthmatics

My sawed off by the bed, it's a craft-matic
The size of a Subway sandwich, ask Jared
Big foot givin' input
Every rhyme like Lisa Ray homie, fuck with it it's a good look
I'm a lieutenant, the new school respect Red Menace
My society raised a winner
I set any bitch straight to restore order
Lift my pimp hand up like ""Why I oughta""
I don't tolerate the nonsense
I tell my bitch be easy like you straight outta Compton
South by Southwest out in Austin
Tore the place down, Twitter went ""Wow""
Def Jam raised their eyebrow, we independent now
You should've took care of the cash cow
Moooove out my way bitch, Captain Courageous
Fuck you and your iPod if I ain't in your playlist
Bravehearted, I'm Nas in '94
You could say I'm your favorite rapper's favorite
I'm like Penny on the floor wasted
Pump your brakes, divorce me if you can't relate
I get brain when I text, I'm typin' LOL
Chick on her knees like SMH
Get it? Too slow, listen faster cause my time's a factor
You freestylin' and I ain't asked ya

Mitchell & Ness, it's all Jersey
Hoes send my wild DMs—I feel I'm related to X
I don't be up in the trap tryna write raps
Just to say I'm in the trap and made it off rap
As the world turns, I let my L burn
And watch you little fish swim up in my whale urine
Even gay bitches love me like the L-word
And bitch niggas get a clip from a spell bird
I mean the Mossberg
The same thing, my weed got a case of gangrene when it's angry
I act like Scarface up in your project hallway
Make sure you're all covered  by AllState
Me and them beats in your ear like Andre
And what I think of y'all motherfuckers, strange
Fuck y'all, I'm addicted like a menthal
I was born from the days of ""yes, yes y'all""
My boy carrying a tech, rep call
So take your bitch ass home, Watch your cholesterol
I don't talk a lot, I just rap a lot

Negro, funkin' it with the style in your ear, bro
To make you fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin' 'funk' too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasn't that, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter 'cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
Ass off then I just crush on the hush hush

Ask the brothers (Why?) 'Cause I'm bad (Word to mother)

Flexy I'm sexy when I'm standin' in my drawers
If you can't check me when I'm rappin', put the tape on pause
And listen to the incredible shit that I kick my man
Give me five on the backhand then stick
Your finger in a hole and chop the stick quick
'Cause my lip get to the point, to STILL rock the fly shit
Since you're holding your breath, I hold my jewels
I swing hardcore, so I walk, holdin' my tools
The original P-Funk, takes no junk, from a chump, or punk, G
I been this way every since nine months
So get down while I rip the raps from my lip 'cause
My shit's more deep than any tape from Enigma
The gettin' nice, thinkin' killer brother who pop trash
Basic instinct — I'm a shooter so they got blasted
Much ass I kick, groove to the master mix
My song still pumps when it's not even mastered, bitch!
My shit's very chronic so rewind it
'Cause it's like.. eh-eh-eh-eh beyond, bionic!
'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy!
 No lie!
Last brother to battle me I started pissin' in his eye
I'm bad, word to mother, to the motherfuckin' Hubbard
Eatin' her curds and whey, puffin spliffs 'cause she doesn't

I'm swift like a motherfuckin gift for Christmas
When I send my vapors off like Halls menthalyptus
My verbs and nouns shatter walls of underground
Let me be blunt: I like crackin brews with bitches
The ninety-four era I cause terror, whatEVER
Rainin on you punks with the funk, so get your umbrellas
My guns cruise, tennis shoes, what's happenin
I got clapped on, now I'm the one doin the clappin
I'm Flexi Wit Da Tec like Artifacts make Memorex
Blow tape decks when I'm more strapped than latex
Felt like menopause, I make niggas act like beatches
Yo yo that nigga Red be frontin -- with they ass full of stitches
Woo! I just don't give a FUCK
I bite your whole nipple off, sick like sickle-cell anemia
Travel around my curse universe
I'm droppin 98.7 degrees down to Red Alert
Droppin the slang, I'll bust your brains with the real shit
Come hit my blunt so I can make y'all feel it
Abuse niggas verbally so call DYFS
I'm a warrior, to the heart, but I didn't kill Cyrus
Noorotic, my style format rocks the project
I get as ill as chief of police on narcotic
Give me a time and I'll free your mind and lick your
Funky emotions, to blow your veins up with funk overdosage
Now who's that nigga that got your crew bellin?
Not with guns with funk when I rock tracks like Van Halen
I'm in the world, with Jacob's Ladder
I'm seein a lot of happy copycat rappers actin like they got asthma
They attackin me, they slowin they rhymes down actually
They got factories with little dolls named after me
But it's no question my funk segment leave the whole atmosphere
Pressed-in, I take advantage of niggas like I was molesterin
Newark New Jersey's what I represent
Iiiiiiiyiiiihhhhh
My brain be zoned and I phoned home to ET's home
And to hook me up with stash spots to put my chrome in
Whattup to Prince Street, Avon Ave I roll a spliff with
Fat to be passed through Bedrock and Diamond District
So what the fuck I got clapped on for my truck
Then I laughed cause fuck the cash I just wanted my tape bag
Fantastic fabulous my shit is fat shit
The bomb like Elway throw bombs on John Madden
Fuck that, let's get to the point, my shit's the joint, I roast
Motherfuckers from the East coast to the West coast
To your breakfast toast (fuck it!)
I got funk for days by the buckets
PPP packs a bunch of wild motherfuckers
Hold hold hold, wait wait wait wait
Let me school this bitch
Yo bitch my shit is tight, can any MC do this...
""Whose pussy?"" *woman moans*
""Whose pussy?"" *woman moans* *woman moans*...
""Whose pussy?""
And come back on the mic?
I think not, my paper make pen leave nuff ink spots
On blocks where your punk ass still bustin off slingshots
Talkin shit about me when I'm drivin by slowly
Sayin I'm this and that when half y'all punks don't even know me
Now just for that I let your girl suck my dick from the back

Back and forth to the hospital for the constant kickin'

The Lee patch was the shit if you stitch it right
And everybody knew the pattern to Pac-Man
Grams was 15 and that then was happenin'
Niggas used to get robbed at twin city
I was cuttin' on SL's glue with a penny
When EPMD dropped ""It's My Thing""
I said ""Damn, I gotta get up in this rap game""

I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like touchin' your titties
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit
Like Stealin' my mama's car

I used to tell my little sis' ""I'm gonna make it bitch!""
So close to gettin' on that I could taste the shit
In a hot ass room cuttin' Smooth Operator
In my last year at West Side High I barely made it
Flipping eightballs, going to Montclair State
I passed one class and still owe they ass cake
For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th Ave
Sell white boys oregano, dash, then we laugh
That was the days now the times switched up
Son either walk them dogs snuffing or get snuffed
Them ho's got triflin' but much thicker
My weed got better so easily I fuck shit up
I test y'all with my Def Squad camp
And I don't stage show dive unless y'all amped
To all my fans, yo, ""Arrivederchi to ya!""
And any ho that didn't blow Doc, ""I never knew ya!""

Now I'm a grown man doing grown man shit
Now I'm a grown man doing grown man shit
Like still squeezin' your titties
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
With a big ass car
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Rollin' better chronic
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Yo yo shit is crazy out here
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Like smackin' yo ass
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
Like shaving my beard
I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit
I got hair on my chest

The hype's got me, I knock 'em out the box then out socks
Cause when I come around, niggas skate like the rocks
My block's hot, so give me all you got
When I'm done rocking, I leave you all doing the Bus Stop
My format spins wheels like Pat Sajak
I rub niggas out like Ajax now hit the playback
Rrwoahh, look out, roast 'em like cookouts
I'm smoked out, all you MC's, pull your books out
Word is bond it's on I get it on like Marvin Gaye
Starving since the days of Kindergarten
When I die my ashes flip my coffin backwards
Blow shit up like the 4th of July, with half sticks
And on and on, to the break of Rae-Dawn Chong
I'm Killing You Softly with this song, with this bomb
I'm like the Bronx, cause I Boogie Down
I'm representing Jersey motherfucker, when I come around


When I come around, homeboy watch your nuggets
(Ayo yo yo Redman, yo that was last album) Ayo fuck it, bust it
The top, notch, look over your sess spots
Get dumb like a whole bag of jumps with red tops
Regina Steamer Carpet Cleaner, I'm meaner
Then I'm iller than OJ, catching a misdemeanor
Boom-bash I set it off right (right)
I shut off your lights while you caught up in the heights
My lyrics starving, my crew runs like the mob and
The funk butter cup, cause I'm a bastard at robbing
I shake the valleys over Cali when I'm spliffed up
Rock a fifth up, that measure 9.0 on the Erichter
Are you tuned in to my tunes it's booming
Y'all niggas couldn't see me if y'all had zoom lens
I'm accurate like Acura, my style's
90 years maximum, fuel-injected like a Maxima
When I'm around, motherfuckers


The way I get wreck y'all niggas call it mic check
I'm vexed and if I got an itchy finger like Bernard Geotz
With a pad and a pen I blend funky images
That leave your girl hemmoraging for about two million and
Three years move along there's nothing to see here
If I wasn't nice motherfucker I wouldn't be here
Yeah, yeah, put metaphors inside a bracket
Def Squad's in the house and motherfucker we can back it
Come test your skills for real with a bomb bang boom bang
The sound makes your brains wet, with The Color Purple
On the freight train, the devil's the conductor
Let's take a trip to the darkside motherfuckers
My funky pattern takes interludes around Saturn
I'm more diesel than evil medieval like Sebastian
Don't try this at home kids, I zone with
E.T.'s, and other alien type of MC's
So throw your shit up in the sky, cause Redman's
About to get live, like one-two-five
I smoke High Times magazines when I lounge
And broken mics and cords is left when I come around, motherfucker

...partridge and a pear tree
To the girls that wanna sex you up
Mess you up
Lick you from ear to ear from chest to butt
*Yo hol' up later maybe*
*I'll lick you where I'll drives you crazy*
*Then you say Redman you get the right one baby*
Ohhhh!

Who need teaching, I'm cocky, I'm reachin'
It's ugly, like when old lady's ain't decent
I don't like beefin', my weight like a vegan
But compared to y'all on the mic, you ain't eatin'
I ain't talking Lambo's & F1's
More like Rakim & KRS Ones (hahahehe!)

When I hit the rap game, where the fuck was you (where was you nigga!)
'92; I was G Rap cool on camera
Was all in the zone like Deion Sanders
New niggas hate that, old niggas make that
That's like a Maybach, built with an 8-Track
Scrubs, they get Ajax ASAP
Niggas who wouldn't squeeze a mayonnaise pack
70's; I was Commodores, Whispers
Rival gangs like Cowboys in Pittsburgh

You was a young cat, trying to meet Big Bird

So only fadin' is mostly the hair
Got women clumsy, like Sinclair
And so many Jordans my nigga owe me a pair (I swear)
I can afford to take losses
With all these exhausts on the horses (Doc!)
You won't find me up in the office
When it's Friday and I want Ms. Parker
Yeah, I'm kung pow around a sundial
I should be rich now like the Rothschilds
Rather, I'm in the hood with a black'n mild

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

""Get down, get down, on down..."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!""
Rhythm and funk makes you hump
Like Technotronic, I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
'Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""to chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ahhhhhh, you're nasty!"" I know
When my afro grow, that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E, what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)

Hit Squad's the crew, I'm twenty-two, and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
'Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a buh-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-don-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
'Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O-
-Wens with the Benz, I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin'
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut

Could somebody, turn on, da lights

The darkside! Yessss...

Guess who's back when I bring funk like Zapp
All aboard motherfuckers! While your brains get jacked
I'm souped like two scoops of funk juice, word to mother
The way I kick you swore that Jim Kelly was in this motherfucker
The darkside brings apartheid
I act wild like them niggas from Chi-Town on the Southside
Sweeter than this, whoopin niggas down like Jack Nich
When I backflip my tactic graphics
Ooooooh! Redman jams it in
Due to difficulties I won't be done by ten
Friend I got bust shots out the twelve Benz
And then we get the bam-ba-zee from one-ten
Or is it further up? Plus my style murder ducks
So what the fuck, you got the mic turned up fo'?
When I Chief Rock underground MC's drop like sheet rock
Here's a ride to the underground
(repeat 2X)
To the beat y'all...
Ah to the beat y'all, I do the freak y'all
I keep the buddha to last me through the week y'all

Come take a trip on my cosmic movie boogie flicks
Far beyond space so niggas say your grace
It's a True Lie that I bring drama like Schwarzeneggar
When a baby, I had other babies in labor catchin vapors
With two gats I move like too fast like Paxton
Ask Toni Braxton who got seven days of action
Black stars or moons eclipse the volume
Bang zoom I'm sendin honies on the moon with ten bags of boom
Ridiculously I will rip an MC
To degrees I leave spots like chicken pox, check the synopsis
I grow confusing just like Rubik's cube boxes
Float like the butter, fly so what if I
Blow your lenses, tear the fuckin hinges
Did I mention that my lyrical format gets more ahs than a dentist
When I'm in this, the knotty-headed era causes terror
Y'all gimmick motherfuckers better get y'all shit together
One for the money and two for my peeps
Nynex can't even reach my technique or rap sheets
For the Squad I lick two shots word to God
Then take y'all dreams and imaginations

Test the crew with the guns and let's get this shit on

Whyyyyy must I be like that?
Whyyyyy must I pack the gat?
All my loud, niggas be rollin with the ruckus
Ready to get deep bust rounds upon some suckaz
Heard P.P.P. and L.O.D. is a bunch of crazy motherfuckers
Journey to the land is on
The winner of the spittin bomb marathon
The fuck you up lyrathon, whatever you choose
Prepare to lose that title
Turn a vital situations suicidal, my idols, is my Uncles
Who started smokin weed outta bibles
Gave me a puff when I bust my first rifle
Men-estration cycles, I give bitches
Bring your craziest nigga, I'll give stitches
Whateva, go crew for crew, blow for blow
Bang your headpiece and sniff the snow off your ho
I keep it rollin...
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet

How ugly do you have to be to be a hardcore MC?
Niggas be fooled by my plaques and my light skin complexture
My whole texture is bombin, destroyin da schools of the wack
From the Land of the Lost, you get tossed
Listen to my veloc(ity), my crew's comin off
Yeah, more sneaky than casino switches
Diggin ditches for all Moskino bitches
Clockin decimal figures, I'm gettin out diggers
Now my choice of truck is a Land
Cause a Landcruise much bigger
It pack two to three more niggas
Damn I hate a golddigger
Yeah, gimme that microphone
I make opponents shit bricks like Tyson's home
I keep the jacked cellular phone blown in three zones
Love seafood and keep my nine millimis chrome
So it can shine up your dome
When I proceed to give you what you need and clear spots like Sea Breeze
Wreckin your ass armaggedeon style
Twenty four seven while
My crew chin check your profile

I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet

I'm the master of disaster, super rhyme maker
Grimy by nature, database maker
Play em out like Sega, Saturn
Blow your blocks in patterns for about nine acres
Testes, crew wearin bulletproof and double S's
Karl Kani down, camoflouge can't hide the sounds
Of a fo' pound (boo-yaa)
Givin you Six Flags, bustin merry go rounds
But my crew stay ill with that unreal appeal
I be the raw water, my cheek bones outta have gills
Below like the opera
Smooth on the trigger for all you block cockers
I be the key to criminology
Blast and rotate enemies at three buck sixty
Pick me, as your Senator
Take the love from your battlefield son, fuck Pat Benatar
Run, head for the hills
Back in the day, these niggas rolled up on me with
The trunk filled with Bomber Brooklyns, sheeps and quartervilles
Aiyyo take that shit, aiyyo Money snap the grill
Body caught chills as he ate this nine mil
Mine kills two but my nine was sign sealed
And ready to deliver, but Money had me too close
To reach for toast, soon as that nigga blink I broke ghost
Dash back to South Orange Ave with dollar bill to smoke dope

Do you understand?
Forever and ever
And ever and ever

Hey, this Black man made it in America
Basketball and rap attract kids to get the hell out the area
Nowadays niggas kill when you get ahead of 'em
So I backtrack and get 'em some act right
'Cause they confused the rap life for a trap life
Mentally I ain't wrapped tight
You fuck wit me the situation turn to Roy Jones' last fight
This Muddy music
That mean you get offended
These words like liquor when I'm bartendin' (Let's go nigga)
Mama taught me well, she hold a hammer for me
She pray for me when I get it, it's mandatory (Mandatory)
Call me Big Unc and I cosign ya
Bankrolls, rollin' blunts I'll be ya role model
Drug addicts go cold chicken
They veins pop out, They say, ""Red, feed me what I ain't gettin'"" (Heeeey!)
I can get in my car and get out and the same song is on when I get back in and get out (Uh ohhhh)
Check my archive
My stage show is like a bar fight
You want it? Have the right Sean Price (Heeeey!)
I'm a legend, don't call me old school
I'll move niggas like they buildin' in a Whole Foods (Yes sir)
And you gotta be ready for drama
Especially when Bloods and Crips is livin' by ya mama
I'm breathless

Reality speaking, dem all baby
Legendary, man ah bust it from the 80s
Dem fi know me head sicker than rabies
Black in America, yeah, don't play me (Heeeey!)
When we ah step, dem swear see ah di navy (True)
Revolution kick off like inna '80 (Uh ohhhh)
Dem fi know me head sicker than rabies
Black in America, yeah, just pay me

Hey, this Black man made it in America
Facts, my blood killed lab rats
I'm one like a snowflake, abstract
That's why I take it to that Mad Max (Heeeey!)
And I grew up across from a cemetery
That's why my commentary sound like yo obituary
Grown man talk
We got our Denzel on, I told LL I'm just gettin' warm nigga (Heeeey!)
The Tri State where niggas dyin' over bullets in they prostate
And cops against Blacks never gon' migrate
I ain't gettin' shot, they try to pull me over, I turn it to a car chase (Heeeey!)
These little kids into gang violence
Artists gettin' called hip hop but they ain't rhymin'
Y'all voted for 'em, now they a rockstar
I feel like a Black film tryna get a Oscar (Heeeey!)
God forgive me for my sins
You dealt me these cards so I'm gon' play it to win
And I'm tryna get 40 more haters
So I can sign 'em on to the Reggie I hate 'em but glad he made it
I'm breathless

Reality speaking, dem all baby
Legendary, man ah bust it from the 80s
Dem fi know me head sicker than rabies
Black in America, yeah, don't play me (Heeeey!)
When we ah step, dem swear see ah di navy (True)
Revolution kick off like inna '80
Dem fi know me head sicker than rabies
Black in America, yeah, just pay me

Hey, this Black man made it in America
Can you believe how I did it?
I had faith and had God as my witness
I couldn't just be a artist, I had to learn the business
And haters on the side, they tried to sell me wolf tickets
But I'm still relevant, me and rap we got a life sentence
Success is like a bank loan, it's hard to get
I worked hard for errything, I wasn't offered it
And it's up to me to show my babies how to be a boss
I teach 'em how to win but also how to take a loss
And education is key
But nowadays I advise you to learn a trade
And not depend on a college degree (Heeeey!)
I sold drugs but I don't have no story to tell
'Cause music always was my life, Patti Labelle
As long as I live, you'll get honor and dedication
And fuck the media interrogatin'
I'm breathless

You see it on the news
You see it on social media
But when you a Black man in America, it's very scary and terrifying
Believe me!
Sometimes I wonder, ""will there ever be equality for a Black man in America?""
I doubt it!",https://genius.com/Redman-black-man-in-america-lyrics

I'm more nicer than Little Red Robin Hood's grandmama
Puffing on ganja, sipping on a, Cherry Bianca
My grand finale's like an alley when it's rowdy

Ride on my MP-60 and let the S-950 squeeze your titties
That quickly I hooked you, now fix me with your lips b
-atch, unloosen my belt thinking to grab the crotch
But before you do move my Glock before it shoot my cock

And see basically them trick bitches get no dap (word)
And see basically Redman album is no joke (word)
And see basically I don't get caught up at my label (word)
Cause I kill when they fuck with food on my dinner table (word)

I drop a punchline at lunchtime, cause I'm a Close Encounter
Of the None Kind with dumb rhymes, I battle all of y'all at one time
So fuck all you fools out there with the large vocabulary
In your sentence, I don't need that shit to pay my rent with, huh
And to the nosey snake-ass hoes I ask you
Why you be acting all fly when your monkey-ass work at fast food?
And why is it everytime that a multi-platinum artist
Always use the underground to make a comeback?
Is it fair to the hardcore niggas that rap?
That don't give a fuck about the radio plus the next bitch at that?
And being hardcore and mad about wearing high-tech boots and black skully hats?
And making fake-ass frowns because your best buddy packs?

You pay tolls I fly over the Triborough
Hustler, Cadillac on my grill
Getting it, since J Lo is a fly girl

Have you seen a nigga pimpin
And you know I'm lookin' fly
I'm lookin' fly (Lets go!)
I walk around in a Cadi
You know I'm lookin' fly
I'm lookin' fly
I'm international worldwide baby
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly (Okay)
I play F.L.Y 'til I die
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly
You know I'm fly

Who you know get higher than me
Look, Superman couldn’t get flier than me
Im bout to get it started up like I powered the V
Im so fly when I was young they kept me tied to a tree
See im all that and some, cool and handsome
Ladies on my game run smooth as a Phantom
That’s why they can't stand him, still they chance him
Cuz if they really worth it they know ima romance them
But if they not, ima one night stand them
As soon as its over I tell em give my man some
You know Super Fly, Im his grandson
Pimp game vicious with the strength of Sams son
Where im goin you can't come, WHY? Its too far
A place where them niggas are flier than used cars
Catch me im at the juice bar, chillin with two broads
Somewhere in Amsterdam like im Harold and Kumar


You know im F-L-Y till I die girl, you know im fly
Look in my eyes and you know im high
Still loving even though I lie
And im a little too fly to stay grounded even though I try
All these haters wanna clip my wings
Gold diggers wanna get my cream
My money dirty how’d it get so clean?
Im a dino when I dip my thing
I Tell the concierge to get my things
Big Meth always VIP
Stay fresh till I D-I-E
I be rollin it up, so when I puff
You with B-I-G
Ya money young gotta see ID
Why pay, I can fly for free
There ain't no I in We
And there ain't no limit but the sky for me
Be yaself, you ain't lying to me
Cuz there is a difference between what you are and what you tryin to be",https://genius.com/Redman-lookin-fly-too-lyrics

D-E-F Squad
Muddy Waters
Don't get it twisted... nigga

Ayo, everybody in this motherfucker will get touched
Fuck such and such, I roll tight like handcuffs
Rock that ass to sleep with discrete techniques
I beez that, Freak of the Week like I made Knee Deep
Hold up! Rotate around the solar, Madder than Cobra
Composure never sleeps, my stream pumps Folgers
I'm sautéein' MC's with fried rice up in the wok
Without the MSG and chopped celery
See, I made it, my flavor situated
From the nickel plated mic that's hot, to leave your brain inflated
Plus, I'm thick like Quakers on papers
Bodacious MC's get turned to lower cases
Lettering, and the medicine, that I'm swallowin
Get you hollerin', like Marvin Gaye
When his father shot him in the chest
I roll with two stacks of TECs
And mad niggas in sets that'll roll up in your rest, UHH!
Mister Fantastic's crafted off that 50 sack of ass kick
When I'm blasted, my mathematics get drastic
That you can't see with bifocals
Watchin MC's go up and down like stock brokers
I leave your brains on tilt, with ill skills that's milk
That's rougher than jeans that Gloria Vanderbilt
I'm poppin mad shit, plus I can back it
Your man'll be like ""Yo, get that dust off yo' jacket""

It ain't a test or quiz that my Squad can win
Those who know the biz, know we rap kids, get biz
You'll digest, multiple stab wounds to the chest
Then I copycat, kill the rest
With no method to my madness
Bless the apparatus with the baddest
Determined to be the last man, standing on the planet
You'll get attached, like a blood sucking leech
When you fall into my rhythm of speech
Your ears get embraced with a touch of the bass
Head get wrapped up, neck get thrown in a neck brace
Rough rhyme mechanical, lyrical at it who?
Will ironically chronically murder you and your crew
My objective, the way I live, is kinda primitive
See I get to the bottom of the problem, and make shit give
Step in the jam, hooded and high, plastered the master
Cast to the masses, grabs the mic
Ten dollar rappers is what L.O.D. goes after (Tweek, Tweek)
To my Squad, there's no matches, we mashes
Do photo flashes in all flavor S-classes
Bomb attack on wax, lyrical mini Mac to your back
Tie you up, throw you in the Ac'
A public figure, who walks around with a jaded jigger
'Cause I gives a fuck about another nigga, word up

Muddy Waters, yo this is the way that my intro should go
Drunk slow funk flow for Reggie Noble
Fuck with me doe, Mally G doe it's not logic
Playing that big shit get broke down microscopic
Bring it back keep the track ringing, with the bassline
It's major when you savor my flavor, can you taste mine
Face the nine I lace your spine with short fat pace
Around and round, avoiding the time to put it down
Now's the time here, yeah
(Clown where, pick a spot
Neutral grounds or not, we give a fuck, lick a shot)
Gangsta, so called killin', cap peelin', playalistic
I mean, is all that shit realistic?
Play your cards, God, black keep your hand held tight
Nightfall might call your life, shit is trife
On these evil streets after dark
Niggas gettin sparked left and outlined in chalk
New day, seriously, this whole shit's twisted...(As a man)
It's me bombin' on these niggas shitlisted, Mally G
Open your eyes to see, recognize who be a G
Hopin' to rise in thee, industry with E
The villain's at it 'cause I had it (Word up, yeah)
Killin' my psychosomatic pattern rhythmatic (Yeah)

I travel the Milky Ways, and the stars of the Gods
Then return six billion feet beneath to get cigars
My lyrical format sounds off like gun claps
Underground, where you need flashlights and hard hats
My mind is ten levels deeper than Jacob's Ladder
Batter the paragraph, after your gall bladder will shatter
Nyphomaniac on track when I Flex like Funkmaster
Flex you can bet I'm not playing with a full deck!
I go far beyond acting hard and pullin triggers
I just wanna die and come back as the Nile on the river
Zone until I forget how to wake up in the morning
And the corners of my mouth be like foamin when I'm open
Y'all neighborhood roughnecks, I cause a threat
My silhouette, who pack smacks niggas just like Treach
Comin through comin through, put your hands on your handgun
Cause I'm crazy off that chronic from my man Branson

At a rap concert, matter o' fact, Redman
My papers show that you committed the same criminal acts in 12 other states
Okay, what we're gonna do here today, Redman
Is we wanna bring some of that unnecessary anger out your system
But I can't do it alone so what I need you to do is cooperate, okay?
Nod your head up and down for yes, and side to side for no
Alright, okay, erm.. Redman, I hear that you're a rapper, correct?
Okay, If you had your chance to create your own album
In your own words, tell me

My trap house all day I got music on (Keep goin')
I could feed your whole block, nigga, with my food for thought (Keep goin')
I can make you trip more cheaper than a Uber cost
Nigga recognise I'm the boss
Red (Man), I'm a legend
From the era of Makaveli
Straight up and down, I'm six o'clock
You ready or not? I'm after seven

He throw my record on, baby, make that ass bounce (Bounce, bounce)
My nephew Kazzie is rollin' in with that half pound (What up?)
I-I-I play to win, I bet it all then I cash out
Then step like a Frat house

Bang, you go report it

Closet filled with just kilos
Got a livin' room with a pole in it
Turned to the trap house to a freak show
I got pure codeine in my trap
Got pills and weed in my trap
Got triple beams in my trap
Y'all can't serve a fiend in my trap
It's the first of the month, got a line on the front of it
If you ain't buyin', can't come in it
Boy, if you know if you try, we rumblin'
O.G. Mama a hustler
Fish scale, fish scale, ooh
We could break the bricks down
Hol' up, hol' up, get that nigga out the trap house
See a pig tail, big twelve knee

My work good, make her pass out
My baby momma keep trippin' on me 'cause I turned the crib into a trap house

I said what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
(In the dark)

Ayo stash that weed up while me and the cop is riffin'
Damn I knew I shoulda got that stash box built-in
But it's alright 'cause me and my niggas roll tight
We all think alike, we jump out whoever packin pipe
Don't they know who's the freak from the East?
I get faded like Chong and Cheech without bleach
And started spittin' game 'fore these cops start to reach
On these creeps, showin' mentality from the streets
Even though we had a half a pound by the seats
My peeps never tweek, we handle shit when there's heat
Since one cop was white the otha was a brotha
I pulled out my tape and front page of the cover
Of The Source, told him me and Janet's on tour
Broke it down to who's my boss and who I rap for
Plus them niggas, EPMD
Put me D, now I'm runnin with the Green Eyed B-
A-N-D-I-T, and Def Squad camp
Here's your Def Jam tickets and your autograph
Now haul ass, I got a meetin' 'bout seven
Basically I'm saying bye bye like Guy

Ayo what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Hah hah, leave ya butt naked...
(In the dark)
I said what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
(In the dark)

My license, been suspended, for about five years
The system got my ass in the jam
Can't even ride to see my fam in Alabam'
I get petrified everytime I see the man throw the lights on (woop woop)
The mic's on so I stress it
Shit, I'm haulin ass before I start undressin'
Niggas on they knees with they hands on the top of the-
Heads while the Feds crack jokes with the Glock in ya
Don't get me wrong I know a lot of cool cops
That'd let me go if I had two Glocks and oowops
But, I don't, so, I keeps it, real
The five hundred series with deep dish peels
Quick, my bitch, stash, two clips, between two her tits
Before the cops fuck with the Rrr-ah
I'm a nigga of today a nigga of tomorrow, beyotch!

I said, what the fuck are you looking for?
Can't a young man make money anymore?
Hah hah, leave ya butt naked...

Wuditlooklike, to all you trick bitches
And you punk ass niggas out there
I'm talkin to you live from WFDS
We're From the DarkSide radio
It's about two thousand degrees down this motherfucker
But the funk just don't stop
As we take y'all fat roly-poly asses on another journey
To the darkside...

Wuditlooklike? When I wipe off my sweat
Verbally I'm Untouchable like Elliot Ness
To the best of my ability I rock any facility
And fuck the yellow cabs I smoke buddha out deliveries
I'm just as high as the fuckin friendly skies
When I'm, open, you can't even see my chinky eyes
Cause the buddha I smoke, is no joke, when I'm loc'ed
Then I wet it, then you be like -- that shit be soaked!!
I'm saggin my.... Karl Kani...
And Too Black Guys when I get busy like the L.I
Well I, swing it back and forth like a leaf
Without traffic I flow like the B.Q.E
But I can pass niggas straight out of first-class
Then leave em huffin and puffin like first day at Lamaze class
PPP, got the Glocks and techs
And Def Squad always got some fly shit on deck

Zoom your focus, I drop the mic and leave it smokin
When I'm vexed, my concepts 
Wreck like Effect
Verbal communications blow to the next ep
I'm robbin your brains with antilogical, phenomical
Suicidal with lethal type funk spread your nodules
Straight up the weight up plus I max like a Beta
Boy I fuck your head up like a blunt that's laced up

Rock three-sixty-five, twenty-four, Monday through
That other shit, makes them other ship, flip
Funk ridiculous, inconspicous with lyrics
A-uhhm, oh-seven-one-oh-three's where I from

Got a zip-lock of that  in the backwood
Boy I'm up all night, I'm Dracula hustling my racks up
Red and Homie smoke more than Cheech & Chong homie, yeah nigga, that's us
When I'm out on the West Coast, my little niggas say ""Yo, relax cuz""
Rolling up that green crack, that grandaddy, and XO
Got a dancer that love my baby so I'ma leave her with strip throat
I'm a asshole on the mic, I think I was born as a test tube
Y'all fucking with Red, well here's two alphabets, FU

Come down, come down
We just waiting for her high to come down
Come down, come down, come down

Yo, I smoke weed and I sold albums
Fuck with me, you got more problems
Pound of sour gettin' rolled up on my bus, that's a real low rider
Smoked blunt with Waka Flocka, rolled a L with Jack Herer
Colorado gettin' dabbed and all that bud, I'ma need tupperware
Brick City where I'm born at, California got the OG
Bay Area 
And on the West everybody knows me
Smoked a blunt with my boy Kurupt

While the Bom-zee got me and Keith on Dom P
Now who's next to test that funk doctor Joe Pesc'
Make shot's rain out your vest and your hoes rest
I smash the butter-est, emcee, but cool with smotherers
Your guzzling, the Aqua-boogie 'till your bubblin'
You drown in my funk doc aqueduct's
If their's more rocks to crush
Then there's more cop's to bust
That's the hood rule
If it's understood, cool
Whichever him or her? Choose emcee i'll remove
I chill the fuck off when my cup runeth over
With Chandon i rhyme to blow your composure
Hit ya, wit' the, shit kodak couldn't picture
Flip a verse make crews-a disperse real quick-er!
Now who's the nicest on the mic baby pa-rsnip
I'm that crazy raw
That you've been begging for
Hi-ho silver, 
I kills, I thrills I
You can feel the real my skills appeal the
Nigga, I get swifter when i swigger, Old E

Buy a new car and watch the Jersey nigga's take 'em

I get down like that
""How you get down?""

""How you get down?""
I get down like that
Fake motherfuckers get dropped to the mat

You better realize, analyze, recognize that I'm
The bomb ass motherfucker that sport Timber-linds
The blacker the berry sweeter the juice, yeah true
But when I'm through they be like ""Are you in there, boo?""
I'll never rock the cradle, I'm about getting paper
I'll rape ya, for ya style, make my connect fatal
Straight blows after blows, I'm constant with bomb shit
Make them nonsense emcees wonder who my moms is
The Funk Doctor Spock, better known as Reggie Noble
You wanna heat shit up but nigga I'm already smokin'
I split the back of emcees like phillies
And if he out the crap than make them go multi-milly
Total concentrations on the mic and the money
I'm the type to get blunted and roll dice on a sunday
Why don't you stick out your tongue and say ""uhh""
And you'll be happy going down like J. Blige
I take tokes, of the bombazee smoke
Get your nose broke
If your slippin' like the Pocono's slopes
I rang out shots from my mouth a lot
Like a thousand Glocks, pop a thousand watts
On your housing block, Akh!
I got the weed by the stash!

It's R-O-Z the new kid on the scene
Flow catching more vibes than B.L.S in the magazine
I got it, locked with each release drop I be milk like pormela
Or the nine-five Shock, straight from Jersey, Newark I represent
To the fullest extent, I get bent in basements
And run shit, baby sis shoot the gift
Puff a choc and skunk mix, wylin out on this
Ain't nothing you can do, when I scream on you
We run through crews like dress rehearsal
We represent peace to niggas on  street, and the niggas and the bitches that flip keys

The badder the beats, the badder the badder freaks
I have to keep the weed and Rat-tat-tat-er stashed in the jeeps
And I, smoke the lye, whoever were to die
Because i never seen a man high, until he hit Red lye
Plus, my bag of vocal dust bust
All you fake Emcees want to be down with us
I'm leaving no witness
To this, physical fitness
This is for the REAL
Niggas and bitches
Hot as 
Made a pit stop at your penelope
Now i'm locked down for jayo felony
HAH! We knock crews off mad

""How you get down?""
I get down like that
""How you get down?""

The nigga with the most weed
The nigga with them bars (real shit nigga)
Reggie Noble (Let's go nigga)

I call my gun Jackie Brown, I'll let the dog out
You'll get found in the trunk, just like Beaumont
My happy levels at a low count (yeah)
I cut niggas in two, it's like a movie how I pair 'em out
These fat women give me love, and they salary
Take they money, buy bud, and burn calories
I got a hashtag
I'm back for errybody washing they feet and face with the same wash rag
Light-skin back, I flash gamma
This old lady on crack flow, bitch pardon my bad grammar
I take a picture of my balls, with a fan's camera
I stay on tilt like Santana bandana
I got that purp like Minnesota fans
Got sharp sixteens, I wrote 'em with Logan hands
I get it live, give me five
Go against me, you DiCaprio, you'll barely survive
You want that hard shit? Call us
When I was born, I slept with my fists balled up nigga
And you can ask Mario, I'm on that extra
I keep the gas on me, you move like a Tesla
I walked in fucked up, I'ma leave fucked up
Ain't no tellin' how I move (yeah)
And if the crowd wanna see a nigga gassed up
Then bring that ass, baby this is what I do (what you do?)

I tear it up (I tear it up)

Ayo
Niggas follow in my trail, you not ready
Women want it all in they mouth, it's Akinyele
I want that car Ice Cube had, Impala Chevy
Just so I can say ""Turn yo punk ass over!""
Bottom of the 9th, I'm giant, Willie Hayes under pressure
When I'm done, you'll get a blood diamond
That's why I act so cocky in my interview
Even Shaquille ensured me I'm the General
Streets on fire, haters wanting Red to retire
But that's an inside joke to an outsider
If I had a crippled arm, you couldn't play me
I'll run up in this bitch like, ""Baby!""
Jersey boy, I'm cut from a different fabric
I could play Russian roulette with an automatic
And you can ask Mario, I'm on that extra
I keep the gas on me, you move like that Tesla
I walked in fucked up, I'ma leave fucked up
Ain't no tellin' how I move (yeah)
And if the crowd wanna see a nigga gassed up
Then bring that ass, baby this is what I do (what you do?)

So we can all die and get high off of secondhand smoke

Bastards blunts, buddhas bullets black gats is the lingo!
Fuck a jolly jingle, old bitches break for Bingo
Christmas time I crack yak and Kris with Kringle
Gettin funk from nymphos and scratch my nuts witcho' single
Who's the gay scratcher minus the rap masters
Name is Kay, with the gay G after
My thugs on the street with the heat, listen to me
See them diamond D.M. medallions—snatch! You give 'em to me
Mally G's a part of me, Icky slips his ownself mickies
In crowded armories, fuck with Redman you're a dead man at the robbery
You'll be (?) Adebisi greasy put him on to me, fuck that
I'm a throwin' flames fanatic, bashin' brains, come at it
Beat you with the shit that they used to frame the attic
Your skank-ass go voo-doo, poodle-wig wearin rashy
Rusty and trusty, musty-wack-nasty",https://genius.com/Redman-real-niggaz-lyrics
Merry Jane,Red Gone Wild: Thee Album,2007.0,"(Mary Jane!)
Ladies and gentlemen, your host for the night
(This gets me)
Doctor!
(Ugh, ugh! All choked up!)
On top of that, we got Uncle Snoop!
And my man Nate Dogg
From The Bricks!

How do I maintain in this world?
(And you say Brick City!)
A world that's proven meaningful
(And you say Brick City!)
How do I survive the haters?
(And you say Brick City!)
How to take the very thing I work fo'?
(And you say Brick City!)
Where do I go when I'm hiding?
(And you say Brick City!)
Only I don't know, I just gotta' go buy

Yeah, yo Snoop!
If I feel in love with another drug, I'd always be broke
Then I'll never have that Purple to smoke, I don't do Coke!
Dogg, I rarely drink Pepsi
Only Reggie weed would give you epilepsy!
When I talk, dog - never indirectly!
I'm blunt - you got weed, chumps?
I do about 45 over speed bumps
So when you tryna roll, your weed on the flo'
(Gimme me some weed, nigga!)
Joe Piscopo, I play too much
That's why my Saturday Night is Liver than yours
I'll fight niggas over Mary Jane
Even beat Steven's ass on Jerry Spring
Ask The Dogg, my weed religion - basic!
Only nation for the weed, is Gold Nation
Now you high, then throw it up
Even Rick James had to sing about her, it's

Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
(Cause I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all day!)
{Brick City!}
Oooooooooooh (Ha ha, Mary Jane)
{Sing that!}
Oooooooooh, Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
('You know what, see I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all night!)
{And you say Long Beach!}

I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thang (And you say Long Beach!)
Stay away from hocus pocus
That gives me headaches, mayne
(And you say Long Beach!)
And when my sack gets low
No, I don't get uptight
I go and find my girl
Once again, it's on tonight!
(Yo, Uncle Snoop!)

One for the money, and two for the show
And three for the papers, and four for the dro
Here we go, let it flow
Just make sure the end's tight
Take a poof, tell me what it hit like!
Paper bag, fill it with the chippers
My new nickname, Mr. Black Jack Tripper
Two bitches and a pad, at the same time (Hey, Snoop!)
And I cracked 'em both wit the same lines
""Do you like to smoke?""
""Can I take your coat?""
""Hennessey with a dash of Coke?"" (Hennessey with a dash of Coke?)
Niggas tryna holla' like ""whoopty whoop""
Let the bitches co-ride in Snoopy Coupe
You're rollin' with a motherfuckin' winner
And you might win a treat to a TV dinner
We got rules to the game (nephew)
Nephew, the only bitch I love is Mary Jane!
Now, tell the truth!

Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
{And you say Long Beach!}
(Cause I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all day!)
{And you say Brick City!}
Oooooooooooh (Ha ha, Mary Jane)
{Sing that - and you say Long Beach!}

{And you say Brick City!}
Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
{Yeah, and you say Long Beach!}

{And you say Brick City!}
Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)

Mary Jane
She make you do thangs that a nigga wouldn't
Normally do, do

Brick City

To each his own, I'mma have this known from the door

Around the clock, critical I'm bound to drop (stop)
You ain't know I'm nice girl, youse a Wannabe
Like the Spice Girls, you betta think twice girl
I'm untry-able, undeniable
Won't be held liable for givin knots that's untie-able
R-O-Z, recognize my name
Rap G.I. Jane rockin colorful wide frames
Straight from Newark we Brick layers, Na Na slayers
Don't play I coach and pick players
In Da Bricks, get your shit popped locked and stolen
Step back I'm holdin, bitches be rollin
Ghetto style, I'mma stay that ripper
Tryin to get cash out the ass like a stripper
[
Double O

Dub O, I'm down for whateva, do what I gotta to get the chedda
Fuck takin over cities, we conquered galaxies and better
I was put here to crush CD's and wreck tapes
Make a false move, I put this whole fuckin planet in checkmate
Hell with this, we takin over the spot
I don't like to, but I will resort to the Glock
The whole camp is sick, you can't do nuttin but like it
It's like when you drown, your ass sink quicker if you fight it
Talkin bout you used to rob niggas with pump shotties
I know you love club music nigga, but you ain't got a jack in your body
You fake ass niggas, gettin screened like a short pass
And if you incorrect, I'mma diamond cut your bastard ass
You got mind control over me like Deebo but you ain't my friend
Cause when I'm around you be quiet but when I leave you be talkin again
But we gonna do it how you want cause I'm widdit to brawl with you
Now what if I put your bitch ass in a headlock and fall witchu

Yo niggas, shut your windows and close ya doorz
Comin' straight from Da Brick City

Yo, here I come
Yo, yeah, yo YEAH (C'mon, Zee!)
Your bitch said aliens raped her and her four friends
But it was all the Outz, we dressed up as Martians
When I, crack a brew it's nuttin else I'd rather do
Hop out a cab or two to your avenue to battle you
Your style get ate like Italian steak
Then I get Red to sell you achey or a pound of shake
Y'all can open up wide and suck this dick
None of y'all niggas can't fuck with 
Bricks
While you scrubbin dishes, we puffin Swishers
Fuckin women ends up in the Benz trunk with switches
We cop sixty-three nigs
One from every spot, blunts be mystery mix
We got, spots, all my niggas stay in Bricks
While y'all stash clips in bags of Bar-B-Q potato chips
Plus your main honey loved us
Slip her some bom-ba she'll fuck twenty of us

Yo, you pack that little ass gun like Harlem Nights
After we brawl and fight, yo bitch I'mma ball tonight
At shows we so tight we flow like it's one mic
Raw underground, yo Don, tell em what that dough like

D. Don, I gets mine, and stay gettin it
My thug mind'll brawl with rhymes and stay shittin it
Check my shine, iced out platinum like your pendant
V.I.P. ghetto nigga, hustlin and spendin
Got bitches trickin tryin to get with me
Got police, flock niggas tryin to cop from me
How many pounds you want; how many pounds you need?
I cultivate, every block I go and drop seeds nigga
I grow trees, niggas know me, for bein low key
That hustler from A.C

I'm steady shittin on hoes, Grand Royal like the Green Eyed Bandit
Jump straight in the Lex offa New Jersey transit
Let my man spit that Don shit
Gov-Matic spit that shit that's toxic, I rock shit
It's that hot shit like Busta Bust got
Plus I bust Glock, on pussies I trust not
They get blown, burned like minutes on cell phone
Bring the terror to your block like the toughest nigga from jail home
And you dead gone when my squad come around

Hurricane Sandy Relief Freestyle,Muddy Waters 2: The Preload EP,2014,"Every time I roll the dosha, the flow get colder
And that's when the hoes come over, 
freak 'em like Nola
Bend 'em backwards and choke her, 
then I get an encore like Hova
Yeah, they can't stand me, family, but they in Miami
And a rapper ain't taking me out, duck like Manny
Fuck hurricane Sandy, I blow shit up
Even the bathroom on 
Friday like Stanley
Doc's da name, so what's happening?
The hurricane may a short for the gasoline
But no thing, I boomerang hoes
Still call me Marcus, I bang, bang, bang on Jacqueline
Nat King Cole, unforgettable
Even my mama don't call me Reginald
Fuck y'all up like y'all brownie edible
Set if off like Kane the way I let it roll
Breathe sativa
Animals on attack, I'm the zookeeper
Opposite of deeper
My bullets hit the whole body
My nina just signed the prenup
No half when I rip the vocab
Hoes I just met now a dope addict
Future Willy Wonka, the super
Run down on you with a oompa loompa
I'm real, don't take me serious
Little bit Eddie delirious
Niggas copy, but they sloppy
Need to read the blueprint of the nelly vanilly kit, 
KITT
The Knight Rider,
 this ain't for minors
You can't deny 'em, far from a liar
Peace to Kuniva, sour supplier
Hand me the fire, Sandy survivor
That's right, my bars' Klondike
Amsterdam
, those my alumni
Hit 280 onto the turnpike
Looked around Jersey, it ain't no lights
Peace to Queens and Rockaway
Jersey, I love the way we operate
Us not having fun, hustling
That's like marrying Eve, not today
I'm sitting in hurricane Sandy
Bumping the new album by Brandy
Check on my moms and granny
Everybody's alright, family
God is good
Look at the light-skin 2013 Robin Hood
When the lights come on, we can probably up
I hit mommy up with the Cali bud, let's go",https://genius.com/Redman-hurricane-sandy-relief-freestyle-lyrics

Yo, this blunt is for all the niggas that was in the holding pen with me in 
central booking
Welcome to the system

Coming to you live from Newark, New Jersey]

Fucked up  all night

Fucked up  all night


Rock on, rock on, yo 
here comes that Funkadelic
I come wetter than Purple Rain, I bust brains
The Funk Doctor Spot, got the Glock, now I'm smokin out your sess spot
I rock from here to Bed Stuy, I hit the spot like XY
Who is that nigga that's comin six billion feet
I roll my funk and fontum leaf even smoke a blizz with 18th Street
I come massively with sneaky styles like Dick Dastardly
Look at the leather coat and afro like my man Shaft would be
The new vroom, crisp like chicken and Chinese food
I'm just like The Whispers here to put you in the mood
 
Yeah you heard me, got more family than a Partridge
Roll the red carpet for Red from here to corner market
You're tryin' me, I'm a menace of society, right
 Yo, I ain't lettin shit ride
Dropping the verbs and nouns, antonyms and homonyms
Govna Mattic plus I'm diesel like Don and 'em
Chorus:
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

My mama used to tell me ""turn that shit the fuck off""
So I had to play like Foxy and get off 
My shit was thick, I bought a clip then clocked my own grip, had honeydips
'Cause moms made enough loot just to pay the bills with, beeyotch!
Selling bags from uptowwwwn
Me and Lester put our money together now we got the block locked down
31 to local A-Train's, Hoboken
I took the back way, New Jersey transit cops were open
I'm hopin, that they don't go inside my boots
'Cause we had everything, from jewelry to Todd 1 suits
And ClienTEL, I'm drinkin Ballentine Ale in hell
So Redman rock well before our record sell
Then my moms crib was jacked by the jealous
 Is what the basehead used to tell us
 Our whole scheme sinkin like boats
'Cause Les mixed biz with pleasure when we shoulda stuck to lactose
But every good thing comes to a end
With no ends, on the block, sellin weed again
My moms tried to make me go to school, I just didn't listen
Got locked up, now I'm all in the system, listen
Chorus
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on 
Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Rock rock on, you gotta rock rock on

Whassup! I tickle your putty-cats with my loonie raps
On groovy tracks, I make new jacks catch convulsions like groupie acts
From my city I spread it on like Jiffy
It's a mystery, my spliff be live like 145th be
I mold like Clay, and roll Dice just like Andrew
I stay 
""Strapped"" just like Bamboo,
 my Cruiser got mad handle
Whatever, the weather be, I got mental telepathy
So throw your bombest rapper and watch me intercept MC's
I keep my car underground just like the Lords
Even though I'm known like all the four wheels on the course
So let me pull up to your bumper like Grace Jones

Ok Redman, on the count of three I want you to
Completely forget how you did the first album
Erase data number four exhibit C-Y protanium
Now... what I want you to do is concentrate
Concentrate on how you will do the second album
Known element 2-nucleus to the ninth power
Exhibit four-L-W
Now... when I count to three
I want you to fall into a deep mind of emotion
But before you do Redman, I want you to
Focus your mind

*somebody whimpers*
Tired of burning, ahhhh!
*whispered* Kill that motherfucker
E, help me get out of here
*whispered voice cackles* Die nigga die!
I don't wanna die
*whispered voice* Die! Hehehehehe

I want you to concentrate very hard on how you will do the second album
I want you to take the funk where it has never gone
I want you to take this LP to where no other LP has risen

Dirty date niggas cock-blockin' and plottin'
Waitin' for my downfall, Street got options
Fuck y'all, y'all can ball, I'mma stay rockin
All emcee's paused when they heard the album's droppin
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce, joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if you feelin' it
Wild the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)
Who the ultimate? (Wu)
Stay committed, sold my soul to this rap shit (nigga)
Slow your roll, strike a bowl, you get clapped quick

Inform the former the first step was a warm-up
The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear ya Sean John and Phat Farm up (nev-ah!)

Soul Train award

Never lost to emcee's as lame as y'all (nev-ah!)
Trick a bitch car payment off
I'm a orangutang when the chain is off nigga

Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like 
""Nobody Beats the Wiz""
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the Clan and you know the fuckin man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a 
Smith & Wesson
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant
For this aggression, no question, M-E to the F
And be flexin as hard as my erection
Kid learn your lesson cuz what if I decide to start testin

Lubricate y'all veins with this ""Do-It"" fluid
I Einstein the rymes, spit them thangs to prove it
Cross with the Mack, in fact, my game's the truest
Now I'm on the highway, doin it my way
With Street, Illegal, Meth, Roc, and Doc Friday
Performin like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, ain't no friction
I got them rap heads fillin out a prescription, with diciton
Gettin thick when I put fire to the steaks
And burn the odds, like a iron to your face
These long hard years spent 
Oxy-Cleanin

Tokin on my indo..
Smokin on a indo..
Lookin through your window.. (chi-chi, blaow!)
Doin what I win doe, ha ha, ha.. it goes
Who that tokin on my indo? Pow!
Fragile niggas get mashed out
(Who dat?) The Funk D-O-C Spock hash mouth rhymer
The Prime Timer, sharper than barber shop liners
Look at my chin - ninety degree bent
When I spit I make devils come out Yves Saint Laurent (Djinn)
I spend so much money on chalk and the indo
My weed supplier need to build a drive through window
My form of art rock, jewels with Clarks
When my bass sparks for fiends it disturbs the NARCs
Freak pattern after pattern to leave Angeles Los
The roughest rapper a DJ needle came across
Knock it in your Hummer; if it's too hot dial 9-1-1
Hook off on you like 
I Know What You Did Last Summer
Your dog is my dog, we dogs when it's thug time
When the fuckin hoes keep that drow in your bloodline

To my real niggas that are true DOG
Niggas who will bust guns for they DOG
Niggas who will spit ones for they DOG
Niggas who be rollin deep with they DOG
Niggas who blaze blunts with they DOG
Niggas who would do time for they DOG
Niggas who would diss a bitch for they DOG
Yo I'm a dog
I piss on the wall in airport bathroom stalls
Grab the intercom and yell, ""Fuck you!"" in the mall
I drop it with the holocaust force, I got balls
I get my pants fitted twelve inches bigger than y'alls
I went to college, rockin' Taiwan velour outfits
Dropped out, but stuck my friends for college deposits
Nigga, get a country nigga gun bustin
Like they saw 2Pac with two Glocks still thuggin
Fuckin with a dog like me, I call your name out
While you pussy niggas Call ID, when I blaze
You step life your wifee got a baby on the way
The way I flex son you think I'm made out of clay
I'm illin, my lyrics on the blocks make the killings
I string your moms out until DYFS take the chillen'
I don't like to toot my own horn but I'm the shit
And if you hearin me I see you paid that twelve cent
So peace to homey $hort DOG
Peace to that funky nigga Snoop DOG
Peace to that old nigga Dirt DOG
Pour some beer out on the curb for your dead DOG
...
You can call a female a dog too (true)
You can feed they stinkin ass u-canu-bu, DOG
They fuck your enemies and bring the beef to you
You got me, I left a couple in your Fubu
A real raw dog never get jealous
They keep they shit cocked if niggas try to dead em

Hit the New York bar, high on the broccoli
Then hit Queens for a queen like King Jaffe

Sixteen rounds, I buck like Milwaukee
Come on ride, it sounds like homicide
All you marks will know it's the other guys
Gettin' fly while rap is in danger
Six guns, one man, thirty six chambers
Brick city on board like a campaign
And we ain't drinkin' 'less Don is the champagne
Got flows more looser than your spare change
Look dummy, we ain't never in the same lane

You gotta either go hard or go home
You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome
And when you hear the women hittin' my phone
You know a nigga like me'll go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard

Hey, the same chick I tell you you cock blockin'
That's the same chick you take to go shoppin'
Young niggas run on the vet, I bhop em
Leave 'em talkin' through the box like Troutman
That's why a nigga act so hood
I roll up looking at you like ""what""
I can't lie but I like to floss
R8, feet on the gas pedal like *skrrrt*
New Airs on, pimp is in motion
Hot chicks love it how I kick it and coach 'em
They'll do whatever, I'm richer than both 'em
Vegas, I may get eleven on a ocean
Whoa, you can't do it then allow me
I show y'all a real cannon, body
I yell ""Action"" no Slater's clappin'
It only sound like Savion shoes was tappin'

You gotta either go hard or go home
You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome
And when you hear the women hittin' my phone
You know a nigga like me'll go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard

Yo, how you gonna find another nigga like me?
Even my inner-like me doesn't like me
I'm so cocky haters wanna mock me
But they styles sloppy like aisles in a swap meet
Your barbershops couldn't fade it
Finally the weakest links get eliminated
All you young boys that yellin' out ""We made it""
How you gonna create what I elevated

You gotta either go hard or go home
You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome
And when you hear the women hittin' my phone (what's up girl?)
You know a nigga like me'll go hard (Let's go)
I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard (Gilla House nigga)

Piercing the ear drums, how the fuck he do it?
Got little miniature Redmans, crawlin' into it, cause my
Back against the wall get to actin' like a fool
That's what happens to students, when you keep 'em after school
I stay a wild child, beef, bring it like ""Raow! Raow!""
My guns go boom, boom, and your guns go pow pow!
Still, I feel a chill, bumps in my body
The spirits of other MC's records in the party
Cause, me being, the man that I am
I'm awfully hunted by them guns with wide lens on the scope
Sucka, you miss, I'm a get my laugh on
You fuck around and woke up, with the stash gone
How I spaz on niggas is ugly
You got the game fucked up on makin' the money
See I don't say I'm thugged out, but I know my choice
Back up plans, got back up; if I blow my voice
That's why I'm Brick City, can't wait to put my niggas on
To see us perform, we sellin' out at Ticket Tron
What I'm doing is wrong, but It lasts long
Yo, toast the niggas that passed on
Get it while the gettin good, whole life with a grip
Cause when it's gone, that's it, that's it, that's it!

I'm seeing dead people creepin on my income
You win some, you lose some, but you never run

(Yo what's on, come on)
Redman it's the war head; BOOM!
Nigga I don't die, I was born dead
Top of the mornin' to ya, I wake up like a born loser
The world is my Bermuda; Triangle and I'm lost in it
I'm hearin' voices saying ""Red, the wanna put holes in ya authentic""
I walk among winners and I put out work, nigga
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Haters hate on, you can tell the rest of the class
I can see the evil in you, through a masculine task
Smoke the greenest grass I live by the hand of god
That me, ya boys, or ya guns won't leave a scar
You niggas too hard and not ready to scrap
Knowin' damn well, ya moms raised you better than that
Redman the weirdo, I'm my own dirty clique
With 35 KO's nigga I'll make it 36!


Thou shall not fuck with raw, Funk Docta
Takin' ya breath when I drop ya
I feel for you cause cats, try to test me
You a waiteress set of an MC, check please
Been waited way too long, now it's time to put Gilla on the map
Gilla on ya back, same Zombies, from Phila on attack
Niggas want it back, Triggas on the map
Won't stop me, I'm not a quitter that's a rap
If I was just broke you wouldn't notice me
Ha, Ha, but look at the bright side my man
Nobody really planned to fail, you really failed the plan
Gotta keep the bomb like an Israeli hand
My music's killa, your's girlie; Scram!

So I'm rolling that purple in a quarter sack
Getting dome in the Cadillac

Type of hood rat to carry my strap
Hit the sheets or the streets, it don't matter
I'm still black dy-no-mite
Over the track like white on rice
Nigga, all right all right all right
I'm for real, though
Smell that sativa in the air
They want to hit my blunt
But I let em know that Reggie never shares
I'm for real, though
I'm smoking more than most these rappers
My A-team smoke grade A weed
Call it B.A. Baracus
Two hits and pass, obey the rules
And you might hit it again

And buy your own, my friend
Cause I'm rider, smoking sour

I put in a lot of work, so I got what I deserved
Y'all just a bunch of dick swallowers, followers
Rappers speak, y'all repeat like parakeets, mockingbirds
My heart colder than Denver in December
Mix cocaine and painkillers, inhaling paint thinner

My cerebral will keep the white boys sniffin glue
Hotter than Champagne Rump Shaker Part II
Get dap like the Mad Rapper, ""Who da fuck are you?""
The Loaded Desperado, I'm cooler than Rollo
(Aiyyo, what you hittin Doc?) I'm hittin hoes up in the Tahoe
Gettin chickens fightin in the back of the Apollo
Say, ""Fuck dat!"" if I'm a tough act to follow
(""Fuck dat!!!"") Disagree I bring the beef gyro
Only right I spiral the hot shit that I roll

Then buy a six shot Eclipse with plastic grips

And get a gangsta bitch who love robbin shit!


It don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga
You don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga
I turn an independent woman back into a HOOCHIE
Make a Jew rock a Dashiki and a KUFI

I be the, Nutty Professor, style aggressor
Put rappers under pressure, with no cooker

Rock it to a T. like Booker, you're straight shook up
I can't hang with pussy niggas who be scared as hell to push up
Too much money and, not enough time
It be, too many thugs and not enough nines
Hey ho, here come five-oh, stash the blow
Stop suckin on my dick and slide on your Kenneth Coles

And everytime we look around them niggas on my block

Aiyyo them Def Squad motherfuckers keeps it hot

Cause I'm like Noah's Ark from the slums
Holla' at cha frog, I'm getting them +Bud+

Sounds of the motherfuckin' men
Tryin' to get your chain
Tryin' to get cha chay-e-ain!
Flush this down the drain
I'm the new raw on the streets
You can get 10 years per each song
Catch a contact, what I write from the arm
Now little white kids bring pipes to the prom
I was supposed to quit, be an influence
But, the weed is like +Nike+ -- I JUST DO IT!

You got weed?
Then, roll with the Sonny and Cher
Suffering succotash, I leave you suckers sufferin'

Play pussy wit' us
And get fucked quick

I love the sweet taste of revenge
I'm focused, my soul's been cleansed
Now I know who the enemy, and who the friend
But still, with my eyes closed, they both blend
I'm not a follower, I start the trend
Y'all can follow that dummy
I'mma follow this money
Now I'm at the age, where I need to get paid
If a nickel bag gets sold in the park - heyyyyyyy!
Did I stu-stutter?
I got the guns and butter
My craftwork be movin' the numbers
I keep a +Roscoe+ like Kurupt, brother
Hang out my window - BLAOW!
What up, fucker?
Violence sells, but I ain't a violent male
But if you violate, I'll play the violin well

Don't be like Zoolander, waitin' for that Blue Steel

That nigga fucked, he just got robbed!

And out in NY somebody got robbed

Out in Chi Town somebody got robbed
And out in Killa Cali somebody got robbed
And all around the world everybody getting robbed
Keep the gun under 'cause the bricks get wild

I got a younger brother that did 12 joints
For robbery, attempted murder, and assault
So believe me boy when it comes to getting robbed
I got a team my niggas hungry for the job
Jersey niggas, don't sleep on the state
From Paterson to Camden, we increase the rate
Hey young bro, why don't you explain
How you rolled upon a nigga make them come out they chain

Grab a stolen car, load up slow
No mask on 'cause I'm thinking high mode
Let you see my face in the shine of the chrome
It's home invasion when I'm raiding y'all folks
Cock back the hammer and tell them what it is
Gimme all your fortune, everybody lives
I rob you at Mickey drive-thru for a dollar

I got a food table to warm, a new neighbor to warn
And people at the label I'm on
Crunch time, what you think the forty-four is for
When I grub I want the whole smorgasboard
Gotta clean my act up and, get my thoughts straight
Stop smashin the five and appear in the court dates
I won't ride the bike unless it's C B R
Wit no tricks but a bitch it'll be on next

Now he's a cheap ornament, died in a street tournament
Peep the clues, not deep wit dudes
My Benz don't carry shoes cuz I'm cheap as Jews
But I let off this cannon bet your fleet would move
After that I tell you and what the beat to do
Fuck the Visine, duck when I lean out the window
Wit a shottie wit me and myself and Irene and my team
Fuck your mainstream dry off feet

Sippin a beer, 5th with the clip in the rear
That'll lift him off his feet, make him flip in the air

When you open your door and somebody in yo house chewin bubble gum
With double guns, cocked in each hand

Shorty lookin at me funny like I don't get bank
My house is hot bitch, I swim in my fish tank
Every car got a bar, the whole clique drink

The blunts are bigger, the weed got a new odor
Get back to your job fucking up food orders
Me, middle finger's up rockin' new Jordans
The streets listenin' but I ain't listenin'
Unless Puffy make a Biggie album, he live again
White people love the flow so they river dance
Hoes wanna hate, I skip-skip-skip again
What up to Killa Kam boy I'm on that grandaddy
So I can look gorillawhen it's starin' at me
I talk cocky like Freddie Blassie
My backwood residue is like teriyaki
She said ""Stop, no don't"" I said ""No, don't stop""
Look at me, I got my niggas and my city on top
I'ma say yes, what the fuck you mean, yo
I'm a bad boy tryna get all in your ringtone like

Everybody know when you stack your bucks
You gotta ride around with your middle fingers up
Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go
And I'ma go head roll somethin'
Now if you're ridin' in your truck with your systems up
Blunts rolled and your girl with a big ole butt
Now let it go, now let it go, now let it go
And I'ma go head smoke somethin'

I hustle hard for I try to get a quick meal
I throw my hood up like I'm on one wheel
I let it go, middle finger in the air when I'm riding in my truck
When I see your bitch, done deal
That's why I'm going hard like Garnett
I say when it's over, until then all net
I ain't had a chance to shut down the mall yet
Ellis let's get this money, I'm on it
I'm jeans and hoodie maybe a little Louis
My family, guy, they think like little Stewie
That's why we fly to Miami just to get groupies
I said ""Mommy, let's make a movie""
She said ""Stop, no don't"" I said ""No, don't stop""

My 2nd Lighter,Muddy Waters 2: The Preload EP,2013.0,"This goes out to all the people who be losing they lighters and shit. Check it out

I had a dream of smoking 3 L's at one time
On the autobahn wit the lambo red linin'
Stoned like Sly and I'm climbin'
I keep bomb weed, but I stay with no lighter like I'm amish
Granddaddy, blueberry, rolled up ready
Check my pockets but I'm like hold up Reggie
My lighters gone, who jacked me for my last lighter
I think that nigga Jeremiah, the cab driver
Maybe Suzi, that booji broad
Or maybe Michelle from sunset park
I paid 2 dollars for the fire, and when I do shows tell
Promoters that red need lighters on the rider
I'd be at the store like, you wanna buy more lights?
Yeah, wit a pack of backwoods and a coots light
Got a white chick from Wall street, she da whore type
She follow me all night around like I'm frank white
She coulda stole my lighter, 
I trust nobody, I'm investigating my neighbor
If It's black or green then It's mine, don't try to walk off wit it nigga bottom line, I'm on my second lighter


I got all types of lighters
Small ones, fat ones, cheech n chong on em'
Even one wit the Jacksons, Obama, weed plants
Even biggie on it, got Bluetooth, iPad with a TV on it
Nigga I'm a pimp when I'm flickin' the bic
Humphrey Bogart style, wit a blunt and a black n mild
That's why me and my lighter, we like the best group
She feel safe when I attach it to the belt hoop (true)
I keep it Cannon like Mariah
In my phone I got an app that says find my lighter
That's right bitch, you can stop faking it
Bic keep on makin' it, jerz keep takin' it
I love my lighter nigga, so when I ignite the sour
I get the pen and write fire wit her
You like your lighter? Then holla at ya bro
Sean Paul need a light for his video, I'm on my 2nd lighter


Ayo man, you got a light?
I said nah nigga, the last person i lent my lighter to
Ran off wit her
That's why I'm on high alert, like Wyatt Earp
And plus I need my lighter for lightin' my fireworks
I got one blunt, I got my own light
I smoke alone like, Nas need one mic
I ask DJ if he had ...he said
Freeway took it when he turned
I'm on my 2nd lighter",https://genius.com/Redman-my-2nd-lighter-lyrics

Somebody in the house say 'Hell yeah'.. ""HELL YEAH!""

Grab the mic, buck until my neck gets whiplash
My Lethal Weapon tongue need a gun permit badge
Mastermind any flow that can shine
Doc walk the blocks like either yo' ass or mine
Jersey style for dead presidents I'll whoop your ass
With one leg, Kirby style, for thirty miles
Shut the Fawcett to Farah
Drain the Panama Canal up, that'll run like mascara
I pour the Dom like friends at Don Pooh party
Before Mr. T my jewels was too gaudy
My foul mouth turn a New York crowd out
Reach out and touch and use nine to dial out
So Brick City are ya ready, ready
So D.C. are ya ready...
Yo cheers to the undaground, Doc's Da Name
Rap is like the NBA, I love this game
Yo yo, to all my niggas and bitches

Yo yo well it's the Soopaman Luva nah bitch Reggie Noble
Middle finger up in photos
Your flow? Eh, so so
Call me that nigga that got the bounce
And I'll pull up to the party witta half a ounce
I got them niggas in the back and they yellin' ""HO!""
Punk niggas start runnin' like panty hose
Got the Sour Dies' waving up high in the sky
They're saying, ""Redman roll up and let's get high""

Well it's the Soopaman Luva nah bitch call me Pimp Nutz

Last time I seen yo' ass you gave me some chicken feed!
I had to roll on you and show you how it go""
You know how Bricks flow
We pullin' da fo'-fo'
Hang out the sunroof and I'm yellin' out ""YO!
What happened to my weed and what happened to my dough?""
My motion real slow
When I start to bust
And I get the party bubblin' like Alka Seltzer Plus
You niggas smoke dust
If my flow ain't tight
Cause I'm tight like a jewish wife
I'm that nice
Nigga you know Red, I be at the party
Like drinking Bacardi
With somebody
Had to smack a chick for touching my face
I'm like, ""Bitch don't you know there's a gun in my waist?""

Now you don't have to ask nigga who got the bomb
I shotgun like the arm
Or Roger moms
When I pull it ya ask, ""What's Happening?""
We ain't talking, we doin' the gavelin'
It's Reggie Noble on the scene
Call me Mr Green
I got my P.O. thinking that my system clean
Before I seen her, I gargle with the Listerine
So she can turn my felony to a misdemean'
I'm like, ""Bitch don't you know who I be?""
I could go cash a check without no ID
I'm a East Coast legend, you should know 'bout me
This is for my 'hood bitches and real OG's
If you're really unaware
That we insane then tell us
I'm in my underwear

Since you all on my wood, lie again
I advised them, sterilized them
His ear wasn't clear to hear the album

She gotta a sister? I got 'em mixed up
My car inside is dark, tint up

If I was ""Avatar"" in 3D
Hit the T-O-P, it's easy
Your career like George, needy
You can hee hee, but I'm a ha ha
Next to Lady Gaga in a iPod
Near, givin the captain a high-five
I'm, a fly guy - why not?

And follow my ingredients like a cookbook
Let me show you how to hustle, look look
I even got some of the oil that Bush took
Me shook? Look, that is not me

They know I Rush Limbaugh for the ock see
Pardon me partner, you'll find out

Aiyyo I gotta find my motherfuckin mojo
Aiyyo Reggie Noble, aiyyo Reggie Noble c'mere nigga!
Aiyyo start it off while I tell you how it went down
Yo, yo
Put the drop down, get your smoke on
Get your feel on, are you feeling?
Get your girl on, get your squeeze on
Get your bus on, are you chilling?
Are you wheeling, are you feeling?
How you feeling?  And we gon' hooo-oooh-ooh
(Tell me what you doin)
C'mon, yo yo-yo yo, yo yo
I had to put the mash down, throw the cash around
Stay focused, on the case put the hash down
Jetted through the air about five miles per hour
My mojo gone I can't fly like I wanna
But this case is easy, find that motherfucker that
Couldn't wait to be me, put his face on TV
From the Tec blow, I asked my ex-hoes
Pass off some info for a pair of X.O.'s
""Write the check low, I don't do that
I told you that shit before when I boned your back!""
Now I'm back to square one, and everybody hatin
So I popped the flare gun, now they all escapin
Ran into Gator, from Jungle Fever
He's my people and my neighbor, I said I need a favor
He said ""For ten dollars, and for ten Whoppers
From Burger King, I'll tell you the nigga who gotcha.""
Gave him what he wanted plus the extra large fry
He said ""Blue eyes, blonde hair, a white guy""
I said... ""What the fuck going on?!
A white guy interrupting my fuck flowing on?""
So I copped some new ammo, reloaded my flare gun
Stalking like Rambo, mixed with Commando
Gator pushed the ten-speed bike, I'm on the handle
Crashed into somethin cause he high off my man blow
I jumped up and backtracked myself
Who's the last ho I fucked or throat I cut
I said ""Wait a minute, yo, that bitch Jane on the prowl again
I bet she up to no good, actin foul again
Yeah, yeah, it ain't nuttin, I get her if I want her
Matter of fact I'm gonna cause she live around the corner.""
I walked up scared with my hands on my flares and my armor
Cause she bring drama like Jeffrey Dahmer
But I heard fuckin all the way from the bottom
I'm like, ""Damn she yelling!""  Kinda made me jealous
Knocked on the door enraged
Like a broke-ass rapper, at a label that ain't toured in days
""Do it clown, before I count to four now
Cause if I hit five them flares'll blow your door down!""
I heard the zipper zip up, and they was tryin to run
So I re-clipped the clip up, and blew it before one
""Freeze motherfuckers!"", I jumped on Jane back
""I want the cheese motherfuckers! And my name back.""
We tussling, fighting, biting skin and rustling
Slaps in the face, chokes with the belt buckle and
Her knees buckling, I thought to myself
""Where's that motherfuckin white guy she was fuckin?"" then

Bricks Two,Malpractice,2001,"Hey man, hey man, yeah go 'head with that man
Just rhymin over here man
Hey go 'head, go get drunk nigga
Ayyy, go smoke yo' weed nigga
Yo, go drink yo' forty motherfuckaaaah
It's Brick City dawgs over here
We gon' take it down like this, yo, D-Don, Don..

It's bone-afficial my nizzle
D-Don got issues, and a type team that dismiss you
Oh boy! I gets more +Chips+ than +Ahoy!+
I got toys that deploy, I just aim and destroy
I keeps it gully in a bonafide skully
I ain't never had a hit but still get props like Nelly
I'm platinum in streets I got, love in the streets
And I'm more underground than your, basement concrete
Braids in my hair, gold still in my teeth
Still, bringin the beef if you're, bringin me grief
I, rat-a-tat-tat it like one-two one-two
Cock my shit back and let off on your whole crew
I'm Brick City baby twenty-fo'/seven
A project nigga that's, tryin to see heaven
I done ran through hell with gasoline drawers on (AOWW!)
I'm the portrait of a hustler, and once again it's on
I still got money buried in my back yard
I'm Bumpy like Johnson, they call me D-Don
My shit's so dope when you smoke you nod
And I spit that shit that leave you holy like the song

Yo.. we from the place where they pump out D and steal cars
Kids wild wave at you and smile you feel large
Like they cut, and you got the power to heal scars
Never down cause the underground crown is still large
See I rap for a livin, probably rap 'til I die
If you dope, where you been at? Your raps is a lie
I'm all real, the one, the raw deal
Do tour, come home, do a flick for four mill'
What the hardcore heads on the block would call ill
Never catch me at the ball-out spot with small bills
Innovative rapper, rhyme in new ways
When I spit niggas cough up blood for two days
Never catch me with material girls, they fugaz'
Rather bounce with a short chickenhead in blue shades
'Til the day I'm rich like Bruce Wayne
I'mma kick raps like pimps blew game
Ridin through your block with six new chains on
Pullin over droppin H-bombs
No doubt I got it locked Sanford Ave. to Penn Station
Chancellor to Central a thousand men waitin

Jersey that's whassup (whassup yo?)
You heard me light the Dutch (smokin weed)
Rock on like what the fuck (what the fuck?)
Jersey that's whassup, Brick City

Fuckin with me is a close call out of my crew
Don't try it I fuckin roast y'all, you and your co-stars
Next up to bat, I done had enough of cats
Blast tracks like what the fuck was that?
Roz spit rawness
State to state, hood streets and block corners
Rhymes hold so much weight, the feds on us
Lot of niggas didn't wanna see me last
But I won't stop just slow down like Easy Pass
Back up and give the R room
Or we gon' brawl worse than cartoons in bar rooms
In my city they don't pop they collar
Cats that do, get shot drop and holla
I'm from the B-R-I, C-K-S
And my, squad is hot, any beef they bless
Any, squad that test gon' meet they death
Ask yourself, do you really need that stress?

Aiyyo, I project my voice so it's right in the crowd
There's a sign at the door, no bitin allowed
Plus the blows that I throw bring a light in the sound
So whoever want the drama I'm invitin them now
Phenomenal shit, spit 'til my abdominal split
Plus combined lines so minds demolish a click
Still burn MC's like Everclear, never fear
With razor sharp skills so ill they, sever ears
Hard to the roots a hundred proof with no chaser
Scarves and some boots a hundred troops with chrome bangers
Now rock with me, I spray blocks with Glock fifties
Still when I spit I flip like Spock sent me
And never gave a fuck what a rapper grossed
But if they, brag and boast I'mma clap the toast
Y'all can analyze this, watch me paralyze clicks
And sabotage y'all, I ain't a fan of y'all shit


I'm a nasty ass disease, and now I got ya mouth celibate
I'm a direct descendant of Hannibal's elephants
That's word to mother, them damn jokes is over
You gon' run your mouth like a motor 'til I fuck up the rotor
It's Double O again, still runnin, still gunnin
It's like I got a cast-iron dick, I'm still cummin
Talkin that killer shit like you blood raw
And ain't even did ten minutes in the back of a squad car
Be big niggas to they weak, I'm true to the streets
Y'all niggas is half-assed like one booty cheek
I'm swear fo' Joseph, y'all is Swiss Miss
My camp'll make your army pull back like a slipped disc
It be the Bricks again, with me with them steel rods
It ain't right unless Shane, Tariq, and Raouf Nayim is involved
I did ery'thang from robberies to dope
And y'all just lie about it, like it's a big-ass joke
Playin like kids, I think you want me to spank you
Ninety-nine on the charts with a ship anchor on your ankle
And if you niggas don't like what I say
I'm in Newark on Market and Hasley e'ry fuckin day

Brick City muh'fucka, that's the way it go down nigga, slow down nigga
Brick City muh'fucka, that's the way it go down nigga, sip yo' liquor
Yo Brick City muh'fucka, that's the way it go down nigga, slow down nigga

Verse One: Method Man Redman
Who want to flip with the acrobatic
From ground zero all the way to attic what we be smokin Tical
The reservoir is now open
I swim the English Channel backstrokin, you don't know me or my style
We hold court and blow trial
You catch 'cal when you browse through my X-Files, who be next now
Man's down, hands down
Foreground by your side when it go down, I dedicate this next dart
To my fucking heart
Little Meth he the best part, now walk with that one, word
Time Time 4 Sum Aksion
Dreamin bout Toni Braxton, blowin her back out like Bob Baglin
I'm throwin wrestling holds
Tag team with Funk Doc, we in funk mode, take yo' best shot
If it don't hip it don't hop
If it don't quit it don't stop, that's the life
I be the super-lyrical individual I be splittin through
That Teflon material to knock Big Ben off of schedule
Better move with a set of tools
I be doin it to mics when I'm a, heterosexual
I load the mic then cock, drop it like three-quarters
When I slaughter don't get caught in the water
Cause the Brick's got it's own World Order
Leave your bitch in shock like the third rail caught her
Styles stay deeper than orca, I float the seven seas with ease
Did more drugs than pharmacies
So call me that lyrical Genovese, you can't compare
Get you steppin like stairs, frats, sororities
Don't make me bring it on back I fuck up the majority
Of niggas lookin hard at me, I Port em like Authority
And when my nigga Meth shine
Out the inner How High mobile rollin three dimes at a time
 Redman and Method Man still...

It's that Jersey representer
Get hit from the bottom to your head when you enter
Word...
Just do what ya feel and I'ma follow (3X)
Funk Doc break it down
Verse Two: Redman, Method Man
Yo, suck my dick out of animosity
The velocity will fly that head and freeze your camps like pottery
To give lobotomies to all you rap colonies
And shunt your million dollar investment, to economy
Impossibly might be the one in black leather
Name tag sayin 'caution when wet by the track wetter'
The hash spreader, I love the grimy shit
Even my girl did grimy shit to me and I went back with her
Three years for carrying a loaded handgun
But it's forever when a nigga  and he lands one
To your cranium
That red dot on your forehead it's not cause you Arabian
(Yo watch you say to him!)
You caught up in a tight situation
I should start erasin your whole organization for makin
Wack tunes while my whole platoon rock the basement
You couldn't come close if I gave you my bookin agent
Or producer, royalty points twelve shot loaded Luger
Even a crowd to get you souped up, you're still wack
I peel caps, on the regular
Destroy MC's et cetera, creep like The Predator
Fuck you, your label moms and your editor
Give you two to the jugular, blood be spreadin
All on my shirt, the king of the flirt shittin
Bitches hit me off more than New Edition
(tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet)
I make them pigs heart skip a beat from the steel physique
So Iron Lung 
Get on the mic and break em off a sumthin sumthin
We moonshine and grow crops
Purchasin the handhelds with the sure shots, it got me spittin
These slugs at my competition, in rap sessions
You-A-P ain't got no weapon, you lip professin
Next in, line, parental discretion advised
These explicit, street linguistics
Better than yo' momma biscuits, we bomb shellin
I might know but ain't tellin, too bad you missed it
Johnny, Dangerously Blaze another enemy made another due paid
Color-safe bleach so I don't fade
Scar your mental with my double edged blade, razor sharp
Get yo' bandaids hold that
Like E said, Get the Bozack, show them wack niggas where the do's at
On the case like I'm Kojak
Kissin the grits on that Flo bitch, flip scripts take LOOONG shits

Pokemon on the pipe, Rudolph the deer Red-Nose
Glow in the night, when his nose gettin right

Who takin my chickens around Thanksgiving? Now that's pimpin!""

Ah-hah AH-HAH ah-hah AH-HAH
Ah-hahahaha-hah-ha
Yo yo, I'm usually flyin through the motherfuckin air
But the utility belt on my underwear need repairs
So I be in back of the bus unwrappin a Dutch
Left court for child support, bitch attackin my bucks (WHY?)
They wanna fuck with certified private eye
Every week, check stubs to show the judge I got a job
Damn this; Soopaman used to stack them chips
Now I'm broke cause little kids riding Batman dick
I'm not a hater but the Caped Crusader blockin my dough
And I'll let off before I push broom on HBO for Mr. Show
I'm critically acclaimed; but the press'll fuck my name up
Police is lookin for me, call the mayor he'a hang up
Nowhere to run to and Brownstone even know it
So I pack the fo'-fifth, and the ice on your wrist, forfeit
No game; slappin all hoes who got the fame
Then I rob em with chickens who got phone bills in they mama name
(You've been framed!) Yeah yeah I know I gotta go out
So I'm shuttin the game down like 30 nuthin blowout
I rip the flow out, from the ceiling, if I spot cash peel it
Soopaman Luva gon' switch to Soopaman Villain

Soopaman! Roll up a L for me
Know I got to pack the heat (sing that shit Dave)
Cause niggas tryin to fuck with me
(Who am I?)
Soopaman! Flyin through the air high
Smokin on that bom-baa
I don't give a fuck if I die
(Who am I?)

Yo yo, I'm back on deck, I never lost the pep in my step
Ride in the cab, drunk as hell, weed and Beck's on my breath
I'm undercover so I'm dressed in turtleneck and the vest
Tec by the waist, yo cabbie make a left on the next
Corner, get out and let the 30-30 cock the loogie
Tryin to set me up like Jim Kelly, MUY, MUY
Before I hit somebody they say, ""We ain't do it!""
I believe them these the same niggas I grew up in the hood wit
Yo yo yo, what's today's date?

Shh, December 8th?
Man today my god damn day off

Whether it's fast food, or transportation. sneaker store, doing hair or straight up strippin'
We gotta get the cash, gotta get the mothafuckin' dough
Brick City is an industrial city, a cold city, a heartless city
A lot of kids grow up here, man. Wanting to be somebody, you know?
George Clinton called us the chocolate city, 90% black and sugarfree
Lot of famous people from the Bricks baby, better do your homework and check it out you know?
I love the bricks yo, you ask me
On a nice day you can shine your car up, joyride through the hood, hit a cookout, pool party, whatever
Straight up gettin' your swerve on, whether a bitch or a nigga
Daytime's the shit out here in the Bricks boy, I love it
But when nighttime comes, the monkeys come out
*monkey noises*
Crackheads, hustlers, chickens, carjackers, thieves, hoes, all these motherfuckers come out when the lights go out
Don't matter how large your crew is, don't matter what city your stankin' ass is representin'

Yo, guess who's bout to stomp tonight?
Three seniors, rockin the mic, catchin misdemeanors
So charge us with what-what-ever you feel
Balls of Steel, clappin those with rap deals
Fuck hot, I'm lukewarm and still perform like a champ
Battle bout, airing your ass out
So who's dropping shit on what day? My click's the greatest
Chill, or feel the effect of hi-atus
Shit shuts down when the Squad's around
It gets _Thinner_, it's hexed like white man from town
Three the hard way can't be touched
My style's too faraway, to capture, even with help from NASA
I'm what they call, a living legend, sha-POW
That's what they call, a Mac-11, sha-POW

Police wanna call dogs and sound off pumps
I short your Blaupunkts if you thump my tape
Yo dial funk if you're mo' stiff than Rikers Isle bunks
Get out your seat, E, spit out the beat
The tracks plow underground concrete out the streets
From baldies to fades, when I rock MC's wave
More flags than Puerto Rican Day parade
And give up, I got the rare footage, of fiends walkin
Barefooted off my rhyme don't dare cook it
You might fall in to intervene
And New Jacks and they girl become Pookie and that, PROM QUEEN
That bodybag won't fit you tonight
You wanna blow up? Drop the mic, stick to the pipe
Hand to hand my crew'll cripple your click in a fight
Take my tapes way Down South and triple the price
Step up on the scene like whazzup? Hey sugah
Before you cock-tease Doc, how that cash put up?
And only way I stop til your click say when
They had enough, cause I could bump to six A.M

Is y'all niggas down to ride? (Man listen)
Would you kill for your life? (Man listen)
Can you get busy all night? (Man listen)

My life is a rap, each song is a flashback
Of antagonizing anxiety attacks
The beat hits the ground and the earth cracks
Niggas be like, ""OH NO NOT THEM!"" Yeah we back
With rhythmatic articulation, God-forsaken
Sick manifestations, PUMP PUMP in your face then
The lyrical force that I put in a rhyme
Will hit you with more power than a molecule enzyme
No matter who what when where how I'll lay you down
With a sick illed out fictitious style
Yo, we all represent the hood -- the only difference
Between us is that we make the shit look good!
Programmable annual slammable
You Lyte as a Rock and I Cram to Understand You
So for niggas on a mission kissin ass and dissin
We get even like an ambixdeterous, man listen

You pay tolls to the drummer, I EZ-Pass at it
But when it's time I bad habit, let the Mac at it
You don't want what we got in store
Keep your mother-in-law indoor when we walk outdoor
Dem four paws on my Benz what you shoppin for
You looked at your rims was like
""What I cop them for?""
Cause I'mma Brick City native, spit nice like Jada'
Sheik style invades ya private property and lay ya
Down for the count, so I'm round in the mouth
You say they town in the house, so I'm drownin em out

When I write my hand is open, other one is catipultin
Onto white sheets we fight to the white meat
Spillin on your 325 icey, wifey

I go to the Benz dealer, test drive it and peal

{You can't see me} you ain't got no chance in hell

Everytime, befo' I catch you, and make you pay
Everyone here works for me, I have em break two legs
Two arms, and - two of your ribs for mistakes you made
The  that you hate that hate'll make you hate yo' fate
Don't ever utter-or-mutter a word soundin like a threat
You see that slew of bruisy dudes, guess who writes them checks?

Bummee Jiddab, my soldiers play the back

We like immigration - we send you back to where you came from
I display the, real meanin of danger with a rusty gemstar banger
Or I have your baby momma flame ya

Your best rapper two-steppin to my song
When he don't know, he ask I write for him

Made bein President one tough act to follow
Watch the Lewinskis that just wanna swallow
Remember Kobe Bryant up in Colorado
Lock me in asylum, your boy too ill with it

Like the ninth inning, tryin to score for the pennant
Sky's not the limit, I'm on a quest
To bring back originality, style and concept
Show you how to write 16's with context
Mix it with a little Lil Wayne and KRS
That's fresh! Dummy, study the art
Study how it all began and see the part
Study how Kool Herc became King of Bronx
Learn, how to rock Wallabees and Clarks
I think I found hip-hop dawg, she right here
Listen up homey it might help your career

Where Am I,New Jersey Drive Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) ,1995.0,"Watch out, we run New Jerz
That's my word, this type of shit will leave your vision blurred
The super-cala-fragist, especially I'm the dopest
Give a grand to any nigga who get closest
I re-pre-sent extra swift, gotcha
Baking bitches like Anita in the Rapture
Feel my fatlity my reality is real
Let me cleanse you like Golden Seal, with my ghetto premiere
Known for blowing focus, hocus pocus you're open
Give me a Sattelite I'll have niggas loc'in in Oakland
Fuck HBO my flows like H2O
I rip MC's by decimal ratios
Non believers, turn your ears to wide recievers
Then you will agree that I'm the best thing since beepers
My ETA is to blow the spot in two seconds
Have y'all niggas ducking in your section with y'all weapons

Huh, motherfuckers grab ya Glocks (Just do it, ha ha, eh eh) {*4X*}

I shut off more lights then Teddy Pender-grass
I'm in the, my funk agenda, make mcs surrender
Feel the friction, when I have your block lit
Grab your shit, when you enter Penn Station at the bricks
Look far beyond the clouds and the skies
I'm the reason why God has a thousand eyes
Spies be peepin, I know the West Coast be checkin
East coast, mid west, I be busting in all directions
Code red, this is funk's uncut, fuck the Feds
I quote Rahim the dread, life about just making bread
So I remain Kool like G. Rap, fuck where you be at
Make moves where you sleep at, the realness what MC's lack
So I kick subliminals for all hardcore criminals
Giving you, something funky to listen to
Dramatic, wiping your crew off with automatics
Ghetto tactics, backwards, I can knock the world off it's axis
And the buddah keeps my luger hot as Freddie Kruger
Who's the, next loser, to show their true colors
Brothers and sisters, I'm like a Motion Picture
Redman's the name, occupation? Smoking niggas
I does it, I do it
I represent Newark to the fullest I could prove it


You know my style, steelo
Throw more bombs then Dan Marino
I jams like Groover Washington live at the BeJu
Flatline people I'm live, lyrics are evil
I got connections up on Pluto *schhh* I read you
The cock thriller, vagina killer
My nine miller, and my niggas
Control dirty raps like Willer
Recognize, im from The Bricks, Dee pack two clips
Lex got two tecs in the Lex, in case shit flips
So who's the next contestant to flex
I translate like Fugees, whether live or Memorex
Def Squad crew always got some fly shit on deck

In the club with twin bitches steamin' on my reefer

Red lost his mind in Africa with Chappelle
Never pump his brakes, when a chick wan' tell
I ""clip her,"" then give her weed that ""Sam can sell""

Another thick chick with ass about 210!

Check here, and it's no question what I'm gon' do
I'm in ya Harlem Nights with Dominique Peru
Drunk as hell, gettin head at the comedy review

I ain't hard to find, but I'm sure hard to kill
Say ""party over here!"" Watch the truck rail
Only dude with H.B.O. on my windshield

I'm drunk off liquor, bitch so I'm drivin


Redman is in the heezay

And hoes come in all colors, I'm finger painting
I'm sick of makin' Lincolns, I wanna make a mil
I'm 360 but not your label deal
I get all my bread, I ain't splittin' a dime
I'm too tight like that leather that’s fittin' the Fonz
I ain't grippin' a nine
Boy I’m a motivator, motivatin' the jungle, gettin' that crack gator
You irrelevant, beta, Gilla House the hardest
The vampires of the game, start wearing your garlic

Forty years old on the block still hustling
Head need Rogaine, bed need Just for Men
Bitch niggas full of estrogen
Dog I'm a boss but I still work hard as a Mexican
Grimey as hell, slimey it smells
Check my rap sheet, I spent most the 90s in jail
Off pills, I feel like George ""the Animal"" Steele bananas
With the blammer get your cantaloupe peeled
For the cake I push pies, my block the bakery
Boy I put you to work like a temp agency
Plus the rhymes you be writing is wack
I know white chicks that write shit tighter than that, nigga
Yeah, we robbing you for the valuables
This that Gilla House grind, undeniable

Look, let me list a few reasons they call me the beast
Cause anytime I see rappers, I think of a feast
And I ain't talking chicken shack, I'm thinking Felipe's
So anytime you think of Ready, you think of the East Coast
No disrespect, I'ma rep for mine
And I ain't saying I'm the best but I'm the next in line
That's why my nickname Ready cause I'm stretched for time
So only way a nigga lock me down is on the dotted line
When I rhyme, it's sort of like a violent crime
So if you get caught with my verse, you do a 3 to 9
Hard minutes of ass whippin', I'm passed different
I play the front like the lead vocals you ad-libbin'
See I'm a giant who, more than liable
To bring the riot through and turn all beef into lion food
Now what I gotta prove, I passed all obstacles (yeah!)
So when it comes down to my talent, it's undeniable

Plasma TV on the mirror outside
I overdo it strong, got chicks that buck ya down
From Vietnam that look like Nia Long
I'm hot, my collar stand up like The Fonz
To hold my guns you need wet and karma bombs
You got chubby? I got chubby too
Me starve in the park, nigga you on ComicView
You funny, I flood the area tsunami
Wash out the weak niggas, then I tag 'em _Dry Me_
I'm married to the game, the bride's my music
When Brick's in the house, there's a problem Houston!
I guzzle Crunk Juice to the neck
So when I walk in the party ain't nobody gon' do shurrr
Redman in-shurrr, it's the principality
Oven like wurrrm for the lyrics I burrrn
Nigga wait your turrrn, we can battle in a second
So I can bankrupt ya like, Chapter 11

Believe it, when I quarterback you receive it
Same crib on MTV Cribs mine
I ain't lyin cause my eyes redder than iodine
I'm back muh'fucker, so up your chain

I run up in your hood like 80 deep
Have it sound like _Drumlines_ at A&T, muh'fucker

I got pitbulls hooked on to a sled
My block'll riot like they shot Cornbread
The Pres'll find a missile with a foreign head
KABOOM! Guess who stepped in the room?
Streetsweeper out, ready to vacumn
Then all of a sudden, you get it in the end
Like Kane from Marlena cousin, I'm a menace
I was broke as hell, first time I made it
Now e'rything I own is voice activated
Boy I'm lyin, I'm just tryin to make cheddar

Found my way back home like E.T. finger
I rock the arena, you know the drill
Get high, get drunk, grab a ho and chill
Eat a meal, then back to the hood for more action
Promotin' Red Gone Wild with no backin
Doc get five on the mic like Joe Jackson
Foreign bitches feelin me for my accent
Talk like a boss, I can't complain
When I do it, it's big like Fulton & St. James
I got Brick City, even D.C. bitches
They all steal for me outta P.C. Richards
I move like a pimp, but I'm far from one

I wasn't lettin y'all swim when the shark was out
Rollin red carpet out, it's Jersey
Me and them together is like Lil' Seymour and Big Percy
I knew women from high school that picked on me
Now I see them, they all wanna lick on me
I hood down homie, rock like Bon Jovi
I can work the nightshift like Yvonne Mobley
Brick City, boy, my flow is on fire
Disagree, I go in your mouth like botox
Pick up Pete Rock, nigga, we all cool
Hit the highway and ask, ""Is the CL smooth?"" nigga

Your style might be parkay, but mine butter
That bitch can't break no bread, then why fuck her
I'm kinda cocky, homeboy, did I stutter?
I popped the umbilical cord on my mother
I jumped out the womb, I became a whale
That's hard to harpoon, I need more room
The hood love me, so I keep it real gully
I got handsome, but my flow is still ugly
Turn the treble out the track and I'll G it
The lines in my rhyme are longer than Ikea
I stay on my grind, but when I come up with an idea
Then yeah, it's party over here!
It's 5 years I disappeared, but I'm back
And tell Nino Brown and them that I'm crack
Grab my bozack, middle finger is up
I got your grandma givin it up

If I ain’t got none, stay out of my way
I get cranky, rude, I got snucked in the safe
Score me in it and everything’s ok
How you show it to the spot then don’t come with
Blow trees and backwoods, nigga that’s some dumb shit
Now you know that I’m about that man
Smoke eats smoke, that’s the pot half plan
I make music so I used it while I’m writing
Smoking while I’m doing it, it makes it more exciting

Have you ever been so proud in your life
You living on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take everybody with you
Forget one, let me get two
Have you ever been so proud in your life
You living on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take everybody with you
Forget one, let me get two

I love traveling and seeing people
Showing the ignorant my color skin is equal
I like trying different Thai food and seafood
Making my episode of life another sequel
I like flying on Delta and Continental
First class, playing 'em elevator instrumentals
I'm in the window, got on my headphones
Listening to Big Pun and Wyclef Jean
It's like Exxon, I get gassed up
I shuffle 'round the board like Cassius
That's us when the plane land, hey man
It ain't hard cause I can do it like a caveman
Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sitting at the hotel like ""Oh well!""
I call shorty that I met today at Modell's
Go girl, it's like we in The Matrix
I'm in a new city, with suitcases
I'm overseas with bills with new faces
And if you're not about that you need a facelift, yup

Have you ever been so proud in your life
You living on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take everybody with you
Forget one, let me get two
Have you ever been so proud in your life
You living on your own cloud in the sky

If it's a high life you seeking then you say it
Cause how the hell you gonna win the game if you ain't playing?
I'm in Monaco, swimming in the deep end with 3 dimes, this ain't dominos
Well maybe it was, I set 'em up to knock 'em down and go
The skeletons in the closet, I'm making a new deposit
She was never so erotic 'til we got to the exotic..tic
Now I'm thinking that this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishing that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it, that's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos
We love each other, beyond under covers
That's why I'm feeling so high like them Wright brothers
Fly, I hope it never take material
For you to get your Apple Jacks cereal (Here we go)

Have you ever been so proud in your life
You living on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take everybody with you
Forget one, let me get two
Have you ever been so proud in your life

I'm about five minutes right out ya baby mother

Hit four chicks, then avenge like folk brothers
Then rob a bank teller
I'm sorta like old yella, call me for trouble
I got chop for bullets that spread out the umbrella
I'm advanced boy, da doc bigalow, the man whore
Got Ms. Incredible and cat women on amcord
When neighborhood or city in a drought
Fuck a boat I could fly there, 300 an ounce
Reup my account, wear and durag and I ain't got waves
I only got haze pumpin out the bat cave
So when I'm flyin through ya hood it's a hit nigga
Isabella I need that sour diesel quick nigga
-Call for soopman luva on line 3-
Well who the fuck is it?

What up G?

They tryin to lock me up G
I can't do time cause my time is money
I just came from court for some bullshit charge
They tryin to do me like kim, throw me behind bars
What am I gonna do?

Fuck that I'm comin
With a gun like willis so you could feel drummin
I creep in when the lights out, sneak in to get you out
Lo jacks on my ears to tell me where your where abouts
Cause I air 'em out, sneak in though the West wing
Laundromat, duffle bag thinking of the next thing
 But I'm in the East wing
 Damn my shit broke
 Hurry up nigga, this water look piss cold

Hold tight for me, I'm already in
I'm in the kitchen corridor, climbin up the vent
I'm hot so hurricane so it might take me awhile
So when I get ya we gonna roll like mickey and 
loud

When I'm around, you won't wanna fight

Here we go, Yo, Yo the Soopaman Luv
Crawlin through the vent like that dude in breakfast club
I made a pit stop, seen a freak in the shower
So I gotta quick pop, pimp slapped her with powder
And told her if somebody asks you, you seen nada
And every week I come fuck you with marijuana
 Okay if you looking for Hurricane over there
 Oh shit, Hurricane
 Hey yo get me outta here

Hey yo C.O.'s watchin
Gotta move like grown men
Cause a distraction
Like the food gave you stomach pain
When the doctors come in, start the examining
I rush in with rubber gloves off the ambulance
Gun in one hand, the other palm around the nurse mouth

I'm on that red eye flight, you see the redness in my eyeballs
Homey ain't no question that I balls
I'm fresh as Pine-Sol, what you smellin is trees
Me and my bredderns inhalin watermelon and cheese
I clear my head like Magellan while he's sailin the seven, seas
'til armageddeon just waitin 'til I'm a legend
Please! I am legend, a veteran in my profession
No guessin it's Meth in this session, you smell this herbal essence
Ain't nothin like a first impression
Sky's the limit, and sometimes I'm so fly, I need a flight extension

Yo I know I smell good, when I walk by
I catch sky miles, cause I look high
And plus I look fly baby take a Polaroid
And when you done with that light one wit'cha boy

Yessir, A-YO
I've been in every hood around the world it never fail
Soon as they smell that aroma they say light the L
Yeah, they see me flow, Half Baked like Chappelle
I guess I swim AND smoke like Michael Phelps
Yeah, type the e-mail, tell 'em I got the bud
Females, I got 'em locked, like Casanova Rud
Lookin at my Roley I got time like the Culture Club
And since we off the hook, MMM, I'mma roll it up~!
Girl you know whassup, Friday we gon' get it in
I'm gonna tell you shut up, you'll say ""Say it again!""
Now light one wit'cha boy to let you know I play to win
And tell them other emcees they life paper thin


Pass me a cigar I'll bust it open then I'll dump it out
Dig into my bag of tricks and pull a lil' somethin out (hold up)
That medical marijuana that's pharmaceutical
When I break it down that shit be stickin to my cuticles
The banana kush that's perfect for a gorilla
I twist that motherfucker up and fire up the killer
I put a lighter to the ass end and start smokin
Then pass it over to Reggie Noble and now he tokin
And puff puff pass nigga, don't be like the last nigga (naw)
Gave him a blunt and all he gave me back was ash nigga (naw)
Just tryin to smoke somethin (somethin) then hit the crunk spot (spot)
And shut that motherfucker down with the Funk Doc!

Original Gunn Clappah, Bucktown
Oh! I love to kick it in Cali
My Compton girl tattooed me on her fatty
She said, ""I know you've got hoes in the Valley
Kris Kross me you gon' see the Mack Daddy""
I said ""Yo, I gotta go to Miami""
But my boy Zo Pound so I'd feel a little milli'
I bagged me a XXL, +Eye Candy+
A little bling bling got me +Fresh+ like +Mannie+
I ride through the A with a chick, dirty
Southside Philly know I get it on early
Any hood I'm in, I'm never in a hurry

The ocean liner rhymer, I keep it afloat
My no goes workplace see who’s sleeping the most
Now I’m in

While the wolf got my weight up, face got no frown
I’m in a trench I see a punk getting close
So my right hand’s on my 357 straight from Oaktown

Redman, Gilla House sell weed on Ebay
A man do what he want, a boy do what he says
So I’ll go get my gun, go and show my True Crime
Never scared, I walk in a joint like ‘Do summin’!’
I’ll move something, never stand around and wait for it
Anything I cake on it, 
same way that Jay own it
I’m tryna get back, hand on my click-clack
Southside to Northside, 
G.W. Bridge at
Shit getting ugly, 
I’m a Lion you a Kit-Kat
Beating meeting me, yo your baby mamas wouldn’t risk that

That makes you a gangsta
No matter now many guns you got
You ain't no gangsta
Cause you ain't gon' bust no shots
And that ain't gangsta

Me and the mic like Adam and Eve
Getting y'all nose open like Claritin D
I'm back in the basement, the black Julio Iglesias
Got hoes that's not high maintenance
Can you taste it? Bricks in the air
So next year, they elect Doc for mayor
Whoever the king now, give up the crown
And don't fumble when you running for touchdowns
I'm one quarterback that can throw the bomb
That's why half my arm is golden bronze
Over a hundred yards
Shit I even hit the man in the stand, yelling hot dog
Believe it, my rhyming is good
Each Row is Death like it is signed to Suge
I'm one hot nigga you can find in the hood
So don't find your punk ass lying in the woods
Dead and stinking, L.O.D. back on the map, we linking
There's gonna be a lot of funerals and Lincolns
Keith Murray got his shit together so fuck you and whoever
Gillahouse, that's the code
I spit fire like that dude that won Next Episode
Stop drop and roll while Bricks unload
Muddy Waters, who next to get IKSRFO!

Chicks know I'mma freak on the low
Doc like Saddam, you can find me in the hole
In the bed, they say ""Red tied me to the post
Fucked my brains out."" With your hands on my throat
I know they like the way I rock the boat
Wax ass, my dick squirt Mop N Glo
Mob Double O, I'm in the traffic dipping
You trying to win a Benz with a raffle ticket
But you can have the car and the jewels
I don't need material to put fire to you fools
I started young
Made my umbilical cord a guitar and my mother's stomach a drum
Made my first hit when I was three months
Celebrated, left my mom throwing up
Funk Doctor, don't spit he throw it up
Like a fo' fo' built in my lower gut
Yeah, one time for you motherfucking niggas
Yeah, one time for you motherfucking bitches

So bitch let's go fuck

Yo, pins and needles, needles and pins
A happy nigga, is a happy nigga that sins
I'm like Jackie Chan in the hand with pens
Mixed with Jet Li and Anthony Anderson
My clientele is Seinfeld status
My rap quotables, best thing since Hamlet
I'm in the hood like Planned Parent
Bust a nut, get up and put her on mass transit

Keep It Real (Tell Me),Rush Hour 2 - Soundtrack ,UnKnown," Ayyy, motherfucker..
 Yo, Funk Doc, my man Musiq, check it out (AOWWW!)

It's the Doctor Bombay, da yellow hombre
Spotted like Kwame for smackin a blind date for scratchin my Hyundai
It's Doc way - don't like it, then move on
The bullshitter push a Yukon with bullhorns
Arguin - what the fuck we doin?
Starin eye to eye like, who the fuck we screwin?
Here take these nickel bags and deduct your doin
With Knicks I can't ball so who snuck me Ewing?
No ice with no blue and, tires with no shoe and
Cribs with no boo in, pockets like I'm Jewish
Tight, I'm an Aries born in April
That means my attitude is I'm born to hate you
Now let's get it gritty
I'll doggystyle while you watching ""Sex and the City""
My palms on your tittie
I'll bomb yo' committee, if y'all MIDI
I treat your girl like spades and walk off with the kitty
Kitty, kitty..

Tell me why, when I, saw you the, other day
You spoke to me as if I was your best friend or sum'
But when today I tried to say whassup and you walked on by
You had nothin to say to me then
Now how come when I be seein, youuuu chillin
Allllll byyyyy yourself
Youuu, always actin like you know me
And act like you don't when you're around someone work on my nerves
Ohh tell me what is on your mind tell me, what you wanna do
Tell me, how you feel about me so I know how to deal with you
Because, people like you really without them I can do
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers
Sometimes, I can't even understand why you'd even
Bother to pass my way no
Cause, dealin with you kinda makes me wonder
Exactly whereeee yeah does my time go (and noooooo, no)
I can't believe the things that you be doin for me
Knowin in yo' heart you don't really mean to, nooo
Why ya, tryin to get over with yo' shuckin and jivin
When the, only person gettin hurt is youuuu, ohhhh
What is on yo' mind, tell me what you wanna do
Tell me, how you feel about me so I know how to deal with you
Because, people like you really without them I can do
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers

Nah nah nah nah girl you wrong, you wrong, no no no
Almost from the door you ain't shit
I want the bracelet, the necklace, the anklet
That foot spa with the nail and toe paint kit
That half a pound I loaned your pops he ain't flip
That itch your boyfriend keeps Gaultier sniff, y'all good together
When y'all tongue kiss y'all suckin my wood together
Fallin in love, I won't do it; cause some of these women
THEIR CLOTHES LOOK SOOOOOO GOOD, but they act stupid

Next time, that you see me, walkin down the street
Don't even bother to speak, don't even bother, nooo
Cause - if it ain't genuine then ah, don't waste my time
Cause um - I can't deal if you can't, keep it real
What is on yo' mind, tell me what you wanna do
Tell me, how you feel about me so I know how to deal with you
Because, people like you really without them I can do
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers

Yo, yo, yo, yo, Brick City, Def Jam up in here
Yo, yo, scream at me loud, Keith Murray
Yo, yo
Relax ya mind and let ya conscious be free
You now rollin with the sound of the PPP
DJ Twin in the house, yo, Rockwilder in the house
Yo, yo, yo, yo Ica Don in the house and D Don
(Redman)
Check the Dr. Bombay making house calls
Buck trynna outball, I'm an outlaw, brotha come up out yours
Slumped in the front, Cadillac grill
Rollin by passin out heart-attack pills

(Tigga)
Now check it out right here, at the saga begins
It's Redman, big Tigga and the DJ Twinz
Rocka-wilder, comin on through with the Ica Don and D Don, big Tig, drop the bomb
Freestyle in the booth everyday forsure
Keep it rough, rugged and raw and give it ya (more?)
Step out the way and let this thing continue, inhale, the (tron?)
Next be my man Ica Don
(Icarus)
Ica Don blow dro, control the city
And I only hit chicks if they toes is pretty
Pissed off, ain't get to flow with Biggie
No single, still doing shows for fifty
A dirty dog
Chicks try to clean me up, I make em clean the truck till they knees give up
Till they say Icarus ""Can I please get up?""
They think it's Christmas, way I keep the trees lit up
Face it, I'm in the basement, do it right
Y'all know, I do it everyday and night
I'm a sick figure, messing with big Tigga
Yo, D Don, come on in
(D-Don)
Let's play ring-around-the-Rosie, a pocket full of (?)
Pulled out early if they choose to test me
The gift between (?), there's no if, I'm swift
I don't drift from my (?) or give suckas a lift
I'm deep-dish like apple pie, made from Anne Smith
My occupational skills will be sealed with a death kiss
I can't resist, if you insist to diss, once in pissed
No plea bargain, overruled, case dismissed
(Redman)
Do I gotta go ape, or go nutty?
I leave ya eye like a 9-9 Benz Buggy, puffy
Brick brothas get real ugly, trust me
Keep the 4 if you lil lucky, mug me
I ain't got nuthin, but 4 figures
And weed and hash chopped in coffee blenders
My shots like squeegee-men on ya windows
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walking off with
Why y'all talkin, the Doc reinforce it
The mic, is hard to keep my paws off it
Yo girl is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up with King Cobra
Out in a nova, don't bother

Somebody light the fuse so I can bring bad news
To all these crews who can't NBA Jam with the shoes

Drunk enough to start a campaign on ass kickin'
With my nigga Keith who give assists like Scott Pippen
For MC derelict whippin', cap or cock twistin'
Drop your money in the slot if your block don't got
A real representer cocked for action like my block got
Rhyme skills three and a quarter for them drop tops
Your caliber, straight up pussy who pop Glocks
While I kick facts react on funky tracks
Give me room like the Hyatt while I run this jungle habitat
And if I snap, get that monkey off my back
Me and mic's together roll tighter than Slick and Vance Wright
Toast to the real MC's that can feel me
And if your bitch ain't jumpin' now then later on she will be

Or feel the clack, bo! Just blow, permanent
Stick and move with my freaky grooves from here to Newport News, VA (Yah)
Love to eat my pussy filet
Tongue spittin' more quicker than AKs
My grades was an F for all that funky shit I displayed
Well-protected when I hit blocks or hit cock
I'm XL rollin', more than Trojan, the green box (Ugh)
Neurotic, lyrical antibiotic
Some say I'm crazier than fifty Feds on narcotics
I rock cruddy for you and your fuckin' buddy

Bricks is partying, dub drop 80 bombs
Gilla House here, we bout to dumb out
Hittin' your halfway house to break (?) out
It's a lot of gangsters and a lot of freaks
That turn any street beef into potted meat
From Chilltown, Illtown, to New Brunswick!
I bring it back like your day of first tounge kiss
Picture looking good, all two of y'all
You wanna fuck bitches? Let's get it on!
I'm like Marvin Gaye, I'm still starvin'
Crash my car where Garden State Mall is
Took the jewlery, minx, and the cashmere
Roll up in Macy's, smack the cashier
I know you like it hot, that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck, could you not want a piece of Doc?

We don't give a fuck, cause we just drink and smoke and straight East Coastin'
Bitches, shakin', ass in motion, psycho, outlaw, smoker, strokin'
Got a cup? Raise it up! Got a blunt? Blaze it up!
That's yo chick? What's yo chick? On these nuts!
All I really know is that Gilla House is some crazy niggas
We ain't playin', know what I'm sayin'? (Shout out to Dr.Dre!)

Yo, soon as the club close
I'm at the back do' strapped wit' a Haxso, and a Fo' Five
My niggas gassed up, quick to blast up, similar to NASA
Got chickens in the Bricks with they ass up
Thugs on the block tryin' to get after us
What'd you think nigga? I ain't come prepared?
With a big bear grip in my underwear
Hit 'em up, shoot 'em up, head 'em out
Y'all had your turn, Red is up
Don't be shy now, we hustle thick at it
You know a party ain't a party 'less Bricks at it
Get a mic to the Doc and I'll get it crackin'
Y'all lose focus, we keep stackin'

Keith Murray in the back, chain jackin' (x4)

Twist the situation and make your hoe hit ya

Disabling plugs and microphone cabling
Smoke filled automobiles I rode daily in
I hooked the track 'till it blows

With bongos, ha ha

So hit the road, Jack, and don't you come back
Shit I wanna make the cheddar 'till I make base collapse
Hit more holes than Minnesota Fats

Murder 16 bars drunk off of Schnapps
Pump so many tracks you might think I do crack
Rip the microphone like a hair wrestling match
Lick your lips bitch cause your shit might eat chap

On some bullshit fucking with the Triple P

Search 4 Barney (Freestyle),Ill At Will Mixtape Vol. 1,2004.0,"Everybody move, everybody up
Spit like a tommy gun, Tommy Chung
On a safari hunt for Barney Funk
What chick next to get they punani punk
Redman, the Brick Picasso
To the Mexicans I'm a ruthless vato
Out in L.A. selling weed and tacos
Even keep the Rasco inside the Waffle
House; one shot turn power out
I don't do biz I  out
Get your weight up or prepare for the drama
I'm never scared and y'all shake like Muhammad
Ali; I smoke the irie out in Raleigh
Beef and broccoli make me slur like Ozzy
Boy I'm grimey and still got my mojo
Y'all never rap like me, y'all flow So So
Ask Jermaine if I'm Def, call the po-po
Hit the Japanese go-go out in Tokyo
Tell 'em Doc is in the fucking building
Konichiwa, now give me all your shilling
Oops, the wrong country, I meant yen
I beat up the bouncer if he don't get me in
Four years ago I had the rims that would spin
When they were alloy before chrome was built in
You don't know about it cause you wet behind the ears
Still picking up your Easter clothes out of Sears
Boo biddy blah blah talking all hard
Where I feel I'm the new nigga stepped in the yard
D.O.C., get it C.O.D
Made the book on how to be a real MC dawg
I keep the shine, where my neck at
I need a loan from Jay to buy the Nets back
While you headcrack I'mma roll a double
My hands is hot I box with golden glovers
We bring the ruckus, you stay quiet
I.C.U. make you look like you on a diet
X-Box Counter Strike when I cross fire
My aunt still turn the TV with the pliers
Boy I'm ghetto, y'all in denial
Your weak ass style wouldn't make it one mile
In every  I'm the talk of the town
Cause with this mic I'm the crown of the underground
Everybody get up, it's not a drill
Cause my kitchen cabinet filled with no frills",https://genius.com/Redman-search-4-barney-freestyle-lyrics

Blacked out Benz
Stop frontin' 'cause we back out twins
It's Doc and Deini

Put a million in the hood

Rope chains with the Nefertiti charms
Sealin' the packages up with them greasy palms
The only way y'all can see me

My reign unanimous
I got the belt and I'ma handle it
Blow you out like candlesticks
Microphone vandalist

And lost it on my way to Jerz, 'cause I paid it in tolls
So you can kiss my hairy bean bag
FUCK the nation
Just twist ya favorite *titty* nipples to my radio station
Because I say what I mean and do what I say
I had a mind of my own but weed blew it away
And now my lyrics got the parents all disgusted and heated
Because I'm nastier than airplane food and those that eat it
I'm never forgotten (Unh!)
Just rotten straight to the core
Up in ya telly with that wet towel up under the door
So need I say more?
I'm just your neighborhood whore
Wit Coronas and blunts
The size of some 4x4s
People claimin' that they comin' to my side of the South
But they ventriloquists and talkin' out the side of they mouth
So the bullets I'm slidin' 'em out
And the criminals hidin' em out
And they all wanna come in the hood and try to make good but a nigga's guidin' 'em out

If the beef boil I bring more broccoli
Ultimate fighter, lethal weapon

I got a weed spot on the block hannibal live
Pokemon on the pipe, rudolph the deer red-nose
Glow in the night, when his nose gettin right
I pimp snow and vanna white on the hoe stroll

In south park with the chef, in the stolen ford
I'm lookin for my mojo, where it at?
Got a apb on it dawg, where it at?

Crawlin through the vent like that dude in breakfast club

 Okay if you looking for Hurricane over there
 Oh shit, Hurricane
 Hey yo get me outta here

Hey yo C.O.'s watchin
Gotta move like grown men

Yo you could get rugged, rough, hard like Luck

Comes to crazy dough, I never get enough
Your money like old men, can't get it up
I'm spittin up sicker stuff, middle fingers up

Like no eye contact, pounds with the left
If you get offended, I'm talkin to you
Come get it, and there'll be a coffin for you
You done did it, you messin wit Luck, you pressin your luck
Got lots of jewels and I ain't givin 'em up, sho nuff

Stick NBA for the basketball figures
Jiggalo men wit two hoes, John Ritter
Arm lit up, microphone tormenter
I'm hungry as fuck and I came to eat
If you came to shoot Doc can you aim at least
Bricks, sucker MCs that stay hookin off
You boogie hoes like, this what I'm lookin for
Duke, your moms think I'ma helluva guy
Pussy, you don't get it like American Pie
I scar deep wounds, bubble teaspoons
Powder is the rhyme, boggled is the mind
When I spit y'all become fiends to me
Crack cost money, but the D is free

Ayo Luck, do you really know what pressure is?
(Lady Luck)
Nigga, I apply it
The one stealing TVs at the Rodney King riot
Guns on salas, whips no mileage
At the bar three iced teas, Long Island
I stay stylin, boots stay filled with weed
In the V, lane three, switchin up speed
I'ma be obnoxious until I can't breathe
And until then, y'all can't win
Luck's twelve on a scale from one to ten
Influenced by hydro and lots of gin
Nigga back up, damn I need oxygen
Surrounded by lots of men that'll rock your chin and pop your limbs
Handle like Iverson, or Marbury
Flows extraordinary
How bout the gold Chevy, holdin the four steady
Been runnin war, let me know when whore's ready

Starin eye to eye like, who the fuck we screwin?
Here take these nickel bags and deduct your doin
With Knicks I can't ball so who snuck me Ewing?
No ice with no blue and, tires with no shoe and
Cribs with no boo in, pockets like I'm Jewish
Tight, I'm an Aries born in April
That means my attitude is I'm born to hate you

I'll doggystyle while you watching ""Sex and the City""
My palms on your tittie
I'll bomb yo' committee, if y'all MIDI
I treat your girl like spades and walk off with the kitty
Kitty, kitty..

Tell me why, when I, saw you the, other day
You spoke to me as if I was your best friend or sum'
But when today I tried to say whassup and you walked on by
You had nothin to say to me then
Now how come when I be seein, youuuu chillin
Allllll byyyyy yourself
Youuu, always actin like you know me
And act like you don't when you're around someone work on my nerves

That itch your boyfriend keeps Gaultier sniff, y'all good together
When y'all tongue kiss y'all suckin my wood together
Fallin in love, I won't do it; cause some of these women
