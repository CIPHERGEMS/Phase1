Get Money,Conspiracy,1995.0,"Fuck bitches, get money (What?)
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money (Uh, check it out, uh)

You wanna sip Mo' on my livin' room flo'
Play Nintendo with Cease and Nino
Pick up my phone say, ""Poppa not home""
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'
Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on titties sayin' ""B.I.G."", now check it:
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino hoe, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fuckin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Came out on bail, commence the ass-kickin'
Kick in the door, wavin' the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial
Fuck around and made her milk box material
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips
'Cause of you, I'm on some real ""fuck-a-bitch"" shit, uhh
[Chorus: Lil' Kim (Biggie, 
Lil' Kim

Fuck bitches, get money (What? Ain't seen none of these girls)
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money (
Uh

Fuck bitches, get money (
Whoo, look at me
)
Fuck niggas, get money (
Whoo, I told you niggas
)

Niggas, better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch 6 feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard bound
, niggas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin' than the stick-up juxs
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave?
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards sayin' ""I apologize""
Is you with me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me
Nah, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow
Just a lil' somethin' to let you motherfuckers know

Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money

Uhh

(Niggas) grab your dick if you love hip-hop

Gotcha, open off the words I say because
This type of shit it happens everyday

Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot?
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin' and dabbin' shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan grit ya teeth, g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique thick like Luke dancers
Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin' over in the Land Rover
Playin' Big Willie style with the chauffeur, yaknahmean?
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find

(How ya livin' Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers, even the sheisty individuals
Smokin' skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin' down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin' ya bastards
Big Poppa never softenin'
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offering
Leave the fucker coughin' up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covet the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin' my ride, countin' my one's, thinkin' I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin' niggas since
Run and them was singin' Here We Go
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxy, homeboy, you didn't know?
My flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin' shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my MAC-10
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin'
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin' up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?

I used to pack MACs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, Glocks in the bags
Maxin' mini-markets, gettin' money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggas grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, exclude subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the rilli with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin' nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
'Cause they all in line screamin' one more time
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop

Marquise diamonds

600 Mercedes
I'll fly you across the seas in a private jet
Whisper shit in ya ear to get ya panties wet
Honey I'll show you how good life can get
Winin' and dinin', non-chalant in the finest restaurant
Feed you lobster 'cause I'm a true mobster
Lame niggas bore ya, lay ya down in the Waldorf-Astoria
Victoria Secret; lingerie, I like the freak shit
Dim the lights, sex all through the night
King sized beds, Satin sheets gettin' right
Wear you out, leave my number by the phone
When you wake up in the morn', I'm gone

I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight

Spittin' game, with or without the eye contact
With or without contracts, layin' my game down flat
Kleptomaniac, rides any rhythm that you give him, I'm livin' right
Semi-precious stones, exotic bitches in skin-tights
Hands-free mobile phone, showin' women how to live life
If that's your girl, she wasn't last night
Made her life worthwhile, Benjamins by the piles
Turn her frowns to smiles, 
livin' Goodfellas lifestyles
Nails done and hair, livin' rooms with chandeliers
Sex in a strech Lex, no cares for who wanna stare
Yeah, now that's a real women for ya
High execs and lawyers, pearls gems and Tag Heuers
Bachelor degrees, bringin' home bacon and cheese
Freaky Saundra ain't afraid to get some dirt up on her knees

Land's and Lexus' flexed with the M-A-F-I-A
Blunts make my day
Friday to Friday stay bent baby
Plus stylish, sippin' on Bailey's Irish
My wish - filthy rich by sixteen
Swimmin' in cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Song knockin' on ho's answerin' machine, uhh
True baller, bitch page might call her
A little shorty but I like my bitches taller

I admit, back in the days I did stupid shit
Now I changed, I'm into bigger and better things
Like rockin' Cuban chains, bitch copped the Range
Del Vec was set with the Lex and diamond rings
Pop Moët with my bitch when it rain
Drink away the pain, got mad stress on my brain
A little nigga roll for dough
Copped keys across seas, in San Domingo
From a Cuban kid named Sallio, sell mad perico
Coppin' bout four bricks, then I called Nino
Meet me at the airport, feds is on the stalk
I almost got caught cause the dumb bitch talked
How much you make and what we do and where we live at
How much my V cost and where my cash stash at
But the feds still couldn't get nuttin'
J.M. still stuntin' and frontin'

One two y'all, you know we rock ya
Lil' Jamal and Junior M.A.F.I.A

Mally G, the villain, keep niggas feelin'
My trigger finger enhancin' peelin'
Your dome piece with the chrome piece fat
I don't fuck around black, catch a Mac to ya back
Lethal weapon with the eighteen leather
Schemin', bustin' on whoever out the Jetta
Window, think slow sink low
Fuckin' with raw dog 'Mal you ain't know, ahh
Remember this - funk abyss lyricist
Blow the premises out the frame wit this
Killer seen with the guillotine shotty
With Junior M.A.F.I.A. rockin' ya whole fuckin' spot
Cockin' the Glock, fifty, bust, hit the dust
To spit shit murderous, heh

And if I have to kill 'em all, I shall

Donna Karen dime, keep her hair done all the time
My rhymes, somewhat Shakespearean, blood I'm smearin' in
Tongue-kissin' my lawyer, at my hearin' and
In this day and age, my rap is like the plague
I married this shit, y'all niggas still engaged
Turn blowouts to 360 waves
How does 12 gauge feel sittin' on ya tongue, on ya lips 'n'
Dippin' with money L in the green Beamer
Sippin' Zima's, on our way to see Katrina
She said she need a Freak Like Me, like Adina
Fucked her by mistake she had a twin named Regina
I seen her, lights excite all the freaks
Squirtin' on curtains, lips, tits and sheets

Oh My Lord,Conspiracy,1995.0,"Why niggas wanna clock me?
Like that dance called the Tati
Don't they know I break motherfuckers into parts like Rocky
Part I, part II, part III, niggas can't fuck with me
My style's knock-kneed plum crazy (what?)
Who's that wild ass motherfucker catchin' wreck
Stickin' Jamaicans for sound sets outside discotheques
It's Klep the death specialist, Stallone and Stone shit
Stayin' high representin' for the nine-quint
Ras bad guy, burns the house down like Left Eye
Why try mimic? MC's get broke like speed limits (uhh)
Niggas can't fuck with my metaphors
Canin' MC's like they in Singapore; Klep been through more wars
Than Gump or Shore, put together catchin' leathers
On the regular, got that net, push me round and Dread stressin' a
Trick ho, what the Dread won't know won't hurt
Robbin his workers for they work; now, WHOSE TURF IS THIS?
It's Klep's, the clothes wreckers'
Life interceptor, pussy collector
Got your bitch on my dick and I ain't even stressin' her
Check enough sex in her, my styles are regular
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique moves in like the settlers

Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""

Throw gats to Giuliani
Flows tighter than pigeon punani, try me, die G
Dangerous, since my daddy bust me out
The tip of his dick, Biggie Smalls with the wickedest shit
Spit clips, niggas split like bananas
Flavor like Tropicana; orange, mango, peach
I strangle each -- negro for they dough
Niggas get to bendin', got two cases, one pendin'
560 V-12 engine, women spinnin'
In 929 Mazda's, Tammy and Natasha
The ménage à trois around my way
Like Ill and Al Skratch smokin' 50 sacks in the back of Ac's
Windows cracked, so sit back relax
Yo Vec, crush the hash, the Beretta's in the stash

Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""
Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""
Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""
Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""

What you doin' with yourself? Stone heart's the way to wealth
Indecisive thoughts make sentences get dealt
Money makes the world go round, robbin' shit
Fuck a job shit, niggas want cribs, bricks and spliffs
All-wheel automobiles, traction control
For clay roads, rollin' with dough, kickin' game
On the cell with bitches on hold, that's how we roll (uhh)
Rhymes now tight as hell so to the bank I stroll (uhh)
Money on my mind, open lips from my eyes
Reveal pupils shaped like dollar signs --

-- the world is mine!
Niggas frontin', feelin' twelve gauge pellets
B.I.G. is repellent, to all that ""He say, she say""
We play, Russian roulette, fuck the threat
Your whole crew's vagina, you and your co-signer
Nigga, we rollin' in eight and a halfs, TV's in the dash
Three G's in the stash, see we love the cash
More coke to make some more

Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""
Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""
Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""
Niggas say ""Oh my lord!""

Niggas don't know bout my game, they don't know
How complex it is, baggin' bitches in GS 300 Lexuses
And the sex is for summer sports
Passports for drug transports to remote resorts
Bitches with Donna Karan ""Catwoman"" suits, matchin' figure boots
Haircut cute, on tops and garters like prostitutes
My lyrics explicit
Got bitches bringin' they own condoms on the first visit

If Biggie bring big bowls of beef
Backin' bitch niggas down, burners bring bundles of belief
Common thief, slash drug chief, syndicated
Went from 10 K, to 24 K and motherfuckers hate it
J.M. sedated, quarantined (uhh)
B.I.G. for President, buckin' shots past the spleen
9 millimeter dream, MAC-11 nightmares
Electric chairs, which MC's do you fear?

Yeaaah
Back stabbers

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

The buddha got my brain seein' my own my blood stains
Dental records checkin' my remains, it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat, now she ain't there
I'm seein' bitches in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find, see
A little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a bitch wanna choke me 'til I bleed
Now watch a bitch breathe from dum-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect, now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he want my cash
The Lexus and Range, give her sex simple and plain
But these bitches is mad and they niggas is bad
So they scheme on a cream, you know
Fuck the hoes, bitches is detrimental, the guns is essential

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

I'm havin' re-occurrin' dreams, bitches they want my cream
They wanna be lieutenant so it seems, I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin' round and round my bed
The shadow stops, points a Glock to my fuckin' head
I grab my pillow, crack the back window
Pull out the tre-8, bust three times at the gate
Lord, have mercy, the devil tryin' to curse me
I keeps seeing shit that wasn't there in the first
See bitches be livin' mad foul, they fuck my man
Steal out my crib, then come and try and shake my hand
Yeah man, breakin' you down one time
I packs that shit for your ass, chronic for your mind
I keeps it real on all you bitches
I wish you keep your mind off my motherfuckin' riches
Bitches, I'm tired of all you hoes beggin' me for clothes
Bankrolls is all I knows, that shit is dead chicken head

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

The morning's finally here, damn, what should I wear?
Time to get dressed and do my hair, once again it's on
Somebody's knockin' at my door, but when I walk across the floor
To scope it out, the motherfucker's gone
I'm hearin' voices in the back of my mind
Better grab my tool, cause this fool might get outta line
I guess, it's time to test, this bulletproof dress
From puttin' holes up in my chest
I'm lookin' through the peep-hole to recognize the face
I see three bitches and still I got to play it safe
I hope my dress come in handy
But when I open the door, three little girls sellin' candy
Ya see bitches is jealous of Lil' Kim
Because my clique is thicker than the rest of them
All I wanna do is be rich and stay that bitch
Clock dough on the low, you know?

They smile in your face

Never flaunt, now motherfuckers come test me
Burnin' everybody hotter than torches at Jamaican parties
Far from angels, niggas can't see me like Charlie
Style weak? Hardly!
Don't let the wacked pursue you like Marley
JM clique moves in packs like whities on Harleys
Niggas get injured, fucked do' in 40 fingers
Got bitches by bike-by, bussin' Glocks off a' ninjas
Klep don't give three shits to flip scripts
Dismiss bullets from clips, leave niggas rollin' up skateboards
Wit nuttin' under they hips, bitch, so if you test me
Shit gets messy, bustin' .38 speci
Outta paper bags like Joe Pesci
Yo, you know the tune
Make sure bitches don't eat
When it's time to shit out them coke balloons
Bocked up the ninja when it got shady, now I got grown ladies
Bustin' .380's outta E Class Mercedes

Hurry the fuck up bitch, get on!
(Fuck you motherfucker let me out this L)
There they go right there, dot them niggas
(Motherfuckers!! )

MC's get cut like glass, cut like class
Rag tagged and crash, hemp bags, come save dat ass
Who wanna get broke the fuck up? Tell me!
Freakin' vocabulary like Chinese and spellin' bees
T-P-E-L-K held to reflect a device-es
The nicest, Jesus Christ it's
Junior Mafioso, niggas get torn off head to torso
Bullets evacuated out windows
From Heckler and Koch, P7 inmates
Extra .380 on a string 'round my neck 'cause Feds check the waist
No time to waste, grab the loot and escape before next break
Heads are clockin', private eyes are watchin'
Nigga caught up in the hustle
Fuck flippin' packages and tyin' up, minx and rings I bubble
Trouble's what I look for in stores on expensive floors
Beelin' boots is essence, bookin' Pelle's in my drawers
Armani, Gianni Versace, V2
Lost count o' all the little sections me and mans ran through
It ain't hard to discard cans of mace on guards
Leave them bitch ass niggas screamin' like a fuckin retard
Lyrically, I come off like ink alarms
Got styles under the wing like spread is booked under my arms
Niggas couldn't see me with closed circuit TV
Tryin' to peep my steez, like DT's I get over like I'm fifteen

(Hey, you're not fifteen)
I'm fifteen, what?
(What do you think we are? Assholes or somethin'?)
Fuck you! Soundin' like that nigga from Night Court
Loose my cuffs I'm outta here!

MC's be fake like toupes so I transplant
Implant my fist to their face makin' their skin raise
Soundwaves disrupted, they fucked kid!
Earholes, blood erupted, but that ain't nuttin'
The best is yet to come
MC's get strung like heads on drums
They don't be knowin' what I'm knowin'
Flowin' like I'm flowin'
Makin' motherfuckers take nose dives like 747 Boeings
Obnoxious, beef-squashers, face-to-face
Niggas get wet up like galoshes on Klep's place
Due to hard times sayin' prayers committin' crimes
Sick minds don't care, rockin' parties from front to rear
Brains engulfed by ferocious thoughts, it's on!
Runnin' up on Big with Lex with napkins doused with chloroform
Livin' in a world where you do what you must

(Snake-killin' ass niggas, JM one love)

Del Vec, little niggas pushin' Landcruiser jeeps
Gettin' blunted all day, every day of the week
MACs in Maxima's and Acura's
Got bitches drivin' 929 Mazda's, Tammy and Rhonda
Drivin' work down south in the Honda
I'm behind her, in the Pathfinder
Gettin' blunted, my nigga 'N on the XL 600
Ridin' smoothly playin' low-key, watch my bitch
With the brick in the Civic sellin' mad weight
Outta state and shit, I can't wait 'til this record shit is straight
So we can recuperate, get the dough and I'm gone

Motherfuckers fear me, I blow up spots like Ed Leary
Violent pro, sleepin' with guns like Sharon Stone
Mack ass nigga strikes again, chalk my win
Kleptomaniac attracts green stacks from eight pens
And sticky hands with crazy glue like finger tips shoplift
Or pass crews on mountain bikes bustin' four-fifths
Diamond baguettes, Rolex for the bitch, flex
Sit back, sippin' Moët, signin' my signature on cheques
Crime motherfuckin' pays when you know what you're doin'
And gettin' loot since niggas was rockin' Hawaiian suits
What? Don't shoot  , leave ya family upset
Type to trip DT's chasin' down robbery suspects

Livin' life, gettin' richer, 'cause I move coke and bust quicker
Bitches get richer, jealous niggas wanna hit'cha
Stashin' my guns to protect my ones
I see the cash flow, touch it - I blast, you know how it go
In the 5-double 0 SL
Puffin' L's lit while Larce loadin' shells in the clip

Snakes-murder men formin' plots
Lickin' shots outta drop tops and it don't stop
Us from gettin' the lucci creno
My clique tight like Gambino's stickin' casinos
Bussin' down kilos, me and Trife for life
JM shorty's on the run
Cocksucker go get your guns

Murder one's to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder one's to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns

I smoke so much weed, I know my lungs is fucked up
Spit guns like bitches spit sperm when I cum
Party done, used to hustle bubble
With concealed capsules under my tongue 'til my mouth got numb
Now I watch my back like my Spidey sense was tinglin'
Minglin' in clubs with JM puffin' on raw tings
Don't oppose me, shit ain't rosy
Murder a lyrical gangsta like Ini Kamoze

Del Vec project was set down south with Two-TEC
I murdered that, we got mad respect
Sheisty niggas in Vigors puffin' 20's and 50's on the block
I got shit on lock in Little Rock
My bitch got knocked, she sold to a undercover cop
Went to jail, put the Benz up for bail
Now I'm fucked up in the cut
I got to move to a different state to make some quick bucks

As I look around me, dead bodies surround me
Part of drug dealin', killin' millions to make millions
Sittin' on top, tote Glocks
Smokin' pounds and Phillies by the box, gettin' head on the yacht
Presidential Rollie watch, hoes clock me with the 420
Bodyin' motherfuckers for this money

Murder one's to get the funds, live fast or die young

While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot

But anything I touch come straight to the rear
I take chickenheads like the Playmate Of The Year
Cause when I first met her, she had the Lex and the 'tegra

Got me seein' double visions cause I'm tore up loc
It's no joke, da weed smoke got me crazaay
And da E&J got me pissy like a baby
I was fuckin' with these twins gettin' crazy ends
Robbin' jewelry stores for the cash and the gems
Identical bastards on some fast shit
Tried to stash it
Took the nine plastic, had they fam on some sad shit

My conscience buggin'
Filled wit all the bad memories
I'm visionin' dead enemies tryin' ta kill me
In my sleep, same niggas dat I put to rest
Got me wakin' up pourin' down a hella sweat
The drugs got a nigga high and I can't explain
Tye and skunk playin' tricks on my fuckin' brain
Shit is strange cause I know deez muthafuckas dead
You see the murder still flash back in my head

Collectin' C note stacks, I react
And push the niggas shit back (uh huh)

'Till they hung my picture, wanted on a poster
I pack two poc'd Glocks, fuck the holsters
Neva new this lil' G would get the most of

Makin' a livin'
Offa muthafuckin' drug dealin'
Then came beef, The Snakes was wanted in the streets
Shit got hot, my other half did a creep
Handled his business cause he was on his third body
Then laid low wit dis freak ass hottie

Watch for fakes and jakes
Blood money I make, transactions up state
Sparkin' weed and drinkin'
The buddha still got me thinkin'
Thoughts o' death and all the bodies that I left
Face down, you know the routine for the cream
Means necessary
Cock suckas got buried
Nigga raise up or get blazed up

Die instantly, a couple o' shots is all it takes
Aim slugs to ya face

Spin my V, smoke all my w**d
Tattoo on ta ta's saying Big Pa-pa, now check it
You wanna be my main squeeze baby
Don'tcha, you wanna gimme what I need baby
Won'tcha, picture life as my wife just think
Full length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say youse the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Things got hot, you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
'Nother intricate plot, the tramp said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Mo-sci-no hoe, my Ver-sa-ce hottie
Come to find out, you was hittin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin
Pay my own bail, commence to a** kickin
Lick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was, ""Poppa don't hit me no more""
Disrespect my click, my game's imperial
Fuck around and made her milkbox material

Cause of you, I'm on some real...

Grab on it quick as this chick gets deep
Deeper than the p**** other girls six feet
Stiff ones feel sweet in this little petite
Young chick from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard now, ballas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin than the stick up jooks
Rather count a million while you eat my p****
Push me to the limit get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm c***** down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze baby
Don'tcha, you wanna lick between my knees baby
Don'tcha wanna see me whippin your 3 down the Ave
Blow up spots on chickens because I'm mad
Break up affairs lick shots in the air
You get vexed, and start swingin everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your nine, while I cock on mine
Yeah what trick? I ain't got time for this
So what b****? I'm not tryin to hear that s***
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vitadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up, for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards, sayin, ""I apologize""
Is you wit me? How could you ever decieve me
But payback's for real... believe me

Matter fact, we can get rowdy
But only green papers with the faces arouse me

But I only get hard when I see Ben Frank in the bank
It don't pay to baby don't show up
But know what? Better catch me fore my price go up
I'm a ho slut for the dough but, I want the paper
To come, til I throw up, so girl grow up

Check it, part 2

I hate pussy cats, rip 'em with clip from a mac round
Of such, got much, so when I clutch
It's the dangerous touch
Shadow of death, let them forgive me
Not murder, so make an error
See the fatal twist of terror
Suffer forever, piss on your grave on set
Swinging, it can't get no higher
Get cast in a lake of fire
Wicked taste, but just in case
You pace side of place, fuck minks
I pour acid on your face
Axe murderer, I'm stressed I confess
Sacrifice dinners, now I'm the master of the fucking menace
Smoked up like this, my trigger finger's itchin'
Nigga that's snitchin', get in your mouth, snapped the bitch in
Witnesses I kill for the deal
You see my grill squeal, there's still more blood to spill
Trife's my name, ask me again, tell you the same
Surviving the game, aim, tearing ass out the frame
Always a rebel, burner kept, haven't slept
But for my respect, reload my strap then I step
Young and the ruthless, schizophrenic
Thug man, slaughter by the slum
Multiple shots sent amuck
You can't kill me, and you'll be lucky if you graze me
The sick and crazy, I'll have your ass pushing daisies
I am the invisible man, break 18 down in 3 punks
So they refuse to see me

And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!
And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!
And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!
And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!

And I'm about to blow, everybody hit the deck
Take you away, yes, to another level

In molecule, microorganisms wants to use the tombs
Sick like Ethiopians, niggas scopin' in
Loops and cubes, by the toots in my fallopians, huh
See I'mma have to run a check on 'em
Like a doctor with a stethoscope, I have to catch some
Wreck, I'm sitting sat with my crew
So whatcha wanna do?
I hope you brought your nickel plated .22
I may be fishin' on some new shit, click click
Straight to your door, with the nine on my hip
I'm putting suckers to rest, like a bird in the nest
Yeah, I'm emptying my whole clip in your chest
And I ain't faking no moves G
I'm putting marked for death signs on your whole fucking family
And I'm shockin' you like a wire, woo!
Tiz boom fire, me say tiz boom fire!
Shit is real, no Mardi Gras, now here's the deal
Grab my steel, get ill, cancel your will
Now it's time to put the horse under the saddle
While me and my boys bring the motherfuckin' rattle
I'm ready to roll!

And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!
And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!
And if they don't die, then they won't be able to walk!

So control your number, hold, and lock your weed date
I set records straight, get the papes, get the papes
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
Two cultures is these babies in these sanitation jobs
So don't let 'em gas you up, let opportuns pass you up
Make the Arab gas and take their pants like cash

Tell 'em, ""People of color won't change""
Knowing it's a trick to trick they fucking brain
That's how we do things in Crookyn
The realm where fists don't swing
All you hear is click-bang, click-bang
On those who perpetrate with bootleg tapes
Certain scams I can't relate
Now their pocket waits my pocket-weight
Klept the great, it gets through thick skulls
That was your best? Have a fistful
Cris', cribs, and pistols
This, type of music is the perfect setting
For setting shit off in elevators
Tekken, Big, well let's rock
Saw her neck and pocket-book checking
Break out the cup with your henchmen
Start the indo digestion
Yo, you can't rap style on rap's Pharaoh
A lyrical rotisserie when I drop my mad flow
So show those  Academy Award skills
Like you know, who's that rap pro
Step to Klept, you get toast
You didn't know?

Kleptomaniac

You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
Crime fucking pays, motherfucker, fuck a job
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob

A magnum box, VCR box, packing rocks
Hundred bill counterfeits get broke down in weed-spots
""Does the scheming stop?"" You're dreaming, hops
G'ing ass niggas giving D's headbutts and skeet knocks
I run through stores like I don't give a fuck
Customers better duck, security guards is getting snuck
What? I'm stabbing wannabe heroes in the gut, I don't give a fuck
I'm laughing in the camera with a full duff, grabbing my nuts

I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smoking skunk and mad Phillies
Beating down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery is a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm burying ya bastards
Biggie Smalls ain't softening
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offering
Leave the fucker coughin'gup blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Comfort the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whipping my ride, counting my ones, thinking I'm richest
It's, just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbing niggas since Run and them was singing 'Here We Go'
Snatchin' ropes at the Roxie homeboy, you didn't know?

You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
You didn't know? Go steal and rob

Ayo Klept man, you gotta chill with that robbing shit man
Word to mother man, that shit ain't gon' do nothing but bring death
Word to mother, man
I'mma take care of your baby and your mother",https://genius.com/Junior-mafia-steal-and-rob-lyrics

Pause, you just a sucker MC
Shagging for beats, back you down in the club
Put your hands where my eyes can see
The most beautiful-est thing is my beliefs
Like ""fuck the police"",  life's a everyday struggle
Girls be nothing but trouble, bitches ain't shit
If I ruled the world we'd thug them gold digger ladies first
You think I need a girl?
Check yourself, it's a cold world

A hundred miles and runnin'
Girls, they love me, Mr. Big-Stuff

Bow down, you can't touch this, how you like me now?
I move the crowd (what), check the rhymes of a mastermind
Through a Hail Mary changed the scorn, it's just half time
The last real nigga alive with a New York state of mind
You was just frontin', now you a customer hypnotized
Watch them niggas wild out excited

Don't worry just don't bite it

You's a old-timer, you a hustler design late

And my cell phone never ring, it just vibrate
Did a couple years in the pen, I don't sign state

Since Big passed, is when the fame and the thrill's gone
Left 3 mill on the block, and I'm still on
Niggas see my face when the real's on
I do the stealin, but I never get stoled on
My life is like Cash Money bitch when I roll on
And anytime I lay wit a bitch is wit no clothes on
It's hard doin' right, cuz all my life I did so wrong
Pissed, I popped shit like Monica, I'm so gone
After fame comes success, now that my team's strong
Nowadays, I don't need a shoulder to lean on
Just put me in the booth, give me a mic to scream on
And any gun I pack got its infrared beam on
So nigga what you want?

I got my own company, why should I hate?
My paper long as fuck, high as Empire State

To guide you, on who to hit and not to
If a nigga guilty, got to die too
That's the real-la, you're talkin' to the roach killer

About to upset New York like Reggie Miller
Once they say you turn thug, you turn killer
Man, it's hard to turn back when a nigga feel ya

That's why until ya play it back, don't get too familiar

Fuck all you hoes, I blows like suits
Bitches don't shake my hand, they salute the lieutenant
Rich men kiss the back of the hand of the royal highness
Pocohontas, Mafia's behind us, ballin' like Utah
Didn't think a ghetto bitch could come this far
From pushin' Buicks to candy apple red Jaguars
Bitch think I'm rich, I could rock a fool blue suit
A furry Kangol with some cowboy boots
And still be the shit of the night
When I come through
You be on the side holdin' ya cups like the bums do
Waitin' for the Queen to put some change in it
I pull out a 'G' and drop it with a hundred grand left in my pocket
I promoted this shit, so I got's to make a profit
And all the ends are sins to my men's, down his prophet
Me and Lil' Cease, it's part two, me partners
Layin' niggas down like carpenters
So pardon us, like Nike's, we just do it
We ain't amateurs to this shit, we used to it
And all the bodies I killed, keep 'em on file
So when they anniversaries come, we pop Cristall
Ask Bristal, the Golden Child, ta-dow
Take it how I gives it, you talk it, you live it
And don't forget it, bitches

Stop tryin' to sound like her too, bitches

Here's the situation (Uh): Larce got shot, now he facin'

I know he'll miss her
They just a family, other half of me (What?)
Them niggas scared of me
I hope they prepared to be
Shot at, hit up with baseball bats
Thrown in the back of the Ac' with a trunk full of rats
Drive to Brooklyn and back
Take him to the pier (Where?)

Look him in the eye, 'You wanna die, don't ya?'
If you could change everything you did, you would, won't ya?""
But you can't, 'cause my brother can't breathe
Watching him bleed in the hospital, I had to leave
All I wanna do is kill your crew
Your grand moms might get wet on the church-house steps (uh)
The beef is set, whatever, show you the meaning of pressure (Uh)
Killing faggot niggas like ya'll for pleasure (Uh)

Heard he got blast and the shit surprised me
Larceny on his back, that some shit I can't see
But I can see me putting putting you on T.V

Walkin' with cement shoes, stepping on seashells
In the bottom of the ocean, who the fuck you gon' tell?
Who the fuck you gon' see that can outlast me?
Outlast me, stamina's nasty
When I shot your brother, Trife put slugs in your mother
She was fucking her lover, he blew their brains on the cover
If he die, nigga, take the .9 off the shelf, 'cause you done
Nigga might as well buck yourself
Car doors closing, trench coats open
Tommy gun start smoking
I leave you on a cold street, chokin'
On your own blood, fuck the joking, I ain't kidding
MAC spitting, niggas gettin' hit, backflippin' wounded
Tryna plea, breaking off full speed
Niggas jumping gates, screaming, ""Vec, it wasn't me""
I see the fear as I stare through these Cartier lenses
You 10 yards ahead jumping fences
Breathing mad hard, begging God for forgiveness
But he ain't hearing you, so I'ma end this, fatality, finished
Death is calling, Ruger hit you 5 times while you was falling
White chalk started drawing

Yo, yo come here motherfucker
No Vec, man, it wasn't me, man!

I won't grip the .9 and put one up in your spine
I stop you from walking
Shoot you in the mouth and stop you from talking
That box you'll get tossed in
Dressed up neatly for fucking with a B.G
S been Ready to Die like B.I.G. first CD
Told you I was coming, you niggas didn't believe me
Knock down the door to this game so easy
How could you niggas? They call NYPD
M.A.F.I.A.'s the realest gang, you see on T.V
We beat you down, stab you up
Gun you down, my niggas don't give a fuck
The only time I work out is when I lift the H
Have my bullets come in sets, 2, 4, 6, and 8s

Wonder how could 'Pac felt when the last shot was thrown at 'em
Me escape jail, it'd be another rebel home again
Bang with the youngings in the polly with the older men
Viewers upstate you get your face all broken in
Go through it with the brakes, in any state, you'll be loccin' in
Sell your lil' weed, OZs, you'll be broke again
Got a gall' of water and today I got the dope again
You and your squad starve hard like Ethiopians
Might strip this hard, foreign cars they be rollin' in
Got a pack of crack, tried to get the block sew'd again
Fuck your yes-mans, fake fans, and your phony friends

Some'll try to help you, some'll try to stop it
A nigga that hate'll get your LP and cop it
A nigga that hate can be your right man, plottin'
Or make your life rotten, this whole shit is nonsense
I understand this how my life is written
Tragic deaths, stab wounds, and the days in prison
Got a brain full of weed, belly full of Bacardi
Had the slug hit my brain at the next party
By a young cat that think he somebody
Fronting like a gangsta but really nobody
Just a dick-ride nigga posted in your lobby

Like reckless endangerment or the first-degree murder
Niggas is crazy, wanna send me with B.I
Mad 'cause my nigga slide straight through the V.I

You get the AP and I'll get the mansion

And that's ""Gimme"", ain't a killer, but it's in me, yeah

And when them bullets pierce your torso
What does it all mean and where does it all go?
They say the truth shall rise over the lies
These industry faggots'll pull the wool over your eyes
Black out when you're popping a clip, don't ask me
It's just some rough-riding D-Block M.A.F.I.A. shit
To the grave with whatever I know, bury me with some haze
I hope they got a dutch wherever I go

'Nough ice to make it sunshine in the rain

Or is it because I'm balling and chicks throw me ass?
Or is it because I got your rap deal on my wrist?
Or is it because I got 23s on the 6?
Niggas mad when I brag 'bout the jewels I got
Or in the car when I ride when I cruise through blocks
Smoke, tires burning, circle round like the clock
Jump out, Louis down, Louis kicks and clean socks
Can't even scoop a bitch without her eyeing my watch
Front like I'm yawning then I stretch just to show 'em the Glock
Like, listen, ain't nothing sweet, if you try, you're gettin' popped
See that van? That's just in case y'all think y'all got the drop, uh
[Chorus: Trife & 
Lil' Cease
]
You can be flossing and styling on them chicks, glossing
You can ball all day but still gon' die anyway
I copped a crib and a coupe and smoke, it's okay
You can hate all day but still gon' die anyway
You can spend your hand on a chick, fuck her the first day
You can hate all day but still gon' die anyway
You can be jealous, wanna hit me, pull a gat and stick me
You can hate all day but still gon' die anyway",https://genius.com/Junior-mafia-die-anyway-lyrics

Teflon Don, The Best of JUNIOR M.A.F.I.A. ,2004.0,"(
Alright, go ahead
) Uh
Uh-huh
Cheec Del Vec, M.A.F.I.A., huh
400 Entertainment, yeah
B.I.G. forever, and ever, uh, yeah

Why you wanna test me, huh?
You better have your vest and your Teflon on
You fucking with the best of dons, supply coke in restaurants
Sipping Remy or Henny with ex-cons, huh
Why you wanna test me, huh?
You better have your vest and your Teflon on
You fucking with the best of dons, supply coke in restaurants
Sipping Remy or Henny with ex-cons, huh

I brought the 2 in, I'm heartless, next of kin
I pop your mens, leave 'em stretched out in the Benz
M.A.F.I.A. style, kill your family and close friend
My bankroll, I make it hard to bend, I love to spend
Big haze while I'm getting head, I break bread everyday
So I can eat, hit them corners, park up the jeep
Since B.I.G. died, I stay with the heat
It's brand new and I didn't even bust it yet
I got a check that I didn't bust yet
I got a bad bitch that I didn't fuck yet
It's more clips to put in the TEC
Cheek Del Vec, I love rough sex, y'all know the name
I got the diesel in the hood, y'all know the gang
Junior M.A.F.I.A., niggas insane
Up to no good, we the same niggas
Ain't nothing changed, niggas
Y'all trust me, us with the gang niggas
And a couple of olds, to the still fade

Why you wanna test me, huh?
You better have your vest and your Teflon on
You fucking with the best of dons, supply coke in restaurants
Sipping Remy or Henny with ex-cons, huh
Why you wanna test me, huh?
You better have your vest and your Teflon on
You fucking with the best of dons, supply coke in restaurants
Sipping Remy or Henny with ex-cons, huh

I slang 'til the death of it
Until my fingers start squeakin'
Blocks is cold, everything's on the low
Like birds on corners, herbs, I'm wantin' ya
Don't fuck with my kick, throw 'em on ya in ya face
Disrespect the whole character
I ain't mad at ya, just in trouble
We coming at ya
The bigger they come, they harder they fall
We crew fighters, we brawl, crack your jaw
You can't even speak no more, you're scared
Can't even walk the streets no more until I'm dead
You can't hold the heat no more, can't skeet no more
Try to run up on me while I'm in the store, you must be crazy
Now you lifting them daisies for real, uh
And every word that I say is real
Cock the steel, pop shots in your grill
Now you standing there looking stupid as fuck
You knuck huh?",https://genius.com/Junior-mafia-teflon-don-lyrics
Throw Down Your Guns,Riot Musik,2005,"Ayo it's Cease-A-Leo the king back again for more dough
Got my moms all in my business like K-Solo
Hooked up with the M.A.F.I.A., imprinted the logo
Reset the mojo, everything's a go-go
7 figure deal whether it's group or solo
Hooked up with gangsters all across the borough
Get down and lay down, this is B.K., hello, haha
Yo, it's the M-A-F-I-A, the boys is back
With big clips and guns, the boys with MACs
He bring it to any nigga, you won't fall with rats
And my music so dope you should call it smack
Ever since shorty left, you thought the boys was wack
Thought I was never gon' pop, thought I'd never get back
I got my gat, you got your's, but you not gonna clap, so

Uh, I ain't into sucker shit, holmes, I'm into bigger and better things
Bigger and better chains, bigger and better rings, nigga
It's Bang Bang, I invented that city slang
Get your pussy wet, pop-pop with the chitty-bang, nigga
I recite the hottest shit, make the city sing
My lyrics to provocative, I make the whole city band
When it come to work, I make the whole city bang
When it come to work, yo, I be moving the damn thing, so
Believe it or not, believe it, I'm hot
Bet believe any type of drug you need it, I got
Get that coke, get that crack, get that E on that spot
And that fishscale sold, for what you need it, I got
While I'm sitting in the both with the heaters on cock
16's in the clip, when I squeeze it, ya drop
Motherfucker, stop tryna be something you're not

Yo, yo, I could hit the same island like 20 times
Jet across friendly skies
Leave gun stores -- check in the vault -- surprise
FIrst class, cross-leg, suit like a bad telly",https://genius.com/Junior-mafia-throw-down-your-guns-lyrics
